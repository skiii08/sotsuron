The New World," Often beautiful, very slow and obtuse
","This film really should be caused 'Pocahontas' but Disney took that name. While the film is beautifully photographed, with what seems like hours of flowing water and sun through the tree shots, the story and the editing almost completely hides what is going on in the story. In fact some of the editing makes the film look like a rough cut with black slugs filling in for missing scenes.What little dialog there is presented like an interior monologue (so 'boomy' it is hard to hear what is being said); much is in Indian (they are called 'naturals' to be P.C.)language with perhaps 8 subtitles during the TWO AND ONE HALF HOURS; when you can hear the dialog many of the actors speak so quickly and in such strong dialects it might as well be in Greek.When they are not yelling and slobbering at the camera the actors wander around with no expression so you can apply any feeling you care to their characters.The film also seems to have been a mystery to Colin Farrell who joins Tom Cruise in the area of remaining firmly in the 21st century while slogging through the 17th century like some out of place hippie in feathers and leather clothes and a lot of dirt.",2,18,66,6 December 2005
