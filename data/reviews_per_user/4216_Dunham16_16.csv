The King's Speech," An historical drama
","The story opens with England's King George V concerned that none of his three sons- David, Albert or John, might develop into genuine kingly material worthy to succeed him. John is already out of the picture, having prematurely died at age thirteen without ever making a single public appearance. David, the Prince of Wales, enjoys all the necessary physical appearance and surface manners to make him at least visually and aurally suitable for Royal public diplomatic life as the future King, yet seems in many ways unworthy of the throne. His mother, Queen Mary, agrees with the King on this point, as do the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prime Minister. Albert, the Prince of York, enjoys at least the appropriate moral fortitude and sense of honor and duty to nation and church, and also as leads an upstanding Royal life as his claim to the throne. Albert,nevertheless, stammers in public and is considered by his wife, Duchess Elizabeth, to be an introverted stammerer unprepared to live a public life in a fishbowl. By the time David has ascended the throne as King Edward VIII, Duchess Elzabeth has already sought an unorthodox route toward socializing Albert by taking him in secret to an unlicensed speech therapist in Harley Street who might or might not be able to make him more at ease during radio speeches and public appearances. The mew monarch's clash with the Prime Minister because of his affair with a courtesan closely associated with the Nazis, as well as his clash with the Archbiship of Canterbury because he wishes to take as his Queen an American divorc√©e with two living husbands, raises the possibility that Albert might soon ascend the throne as King George VI. Can his wife and therapist mutually guide Albert to become more at home during public appearances?",9,0,0,24 March 2011
Black Swan," a peek into the dark side of a performer seeking artistic success
",Natalie Portman plays the put upon daughter of an obsessive mother who tries to find meaning in her life through excelling in her ballet troupe. This quest to find herself probably ends differently for each real ballerina in this real life situation. As a psychological fantasy Hollywood movie Natalie is not sure how to get what she wants. Each time she thinks she is not getting there she becomes depressive and each time she thinks she has climbed a rung she becomes manic. Vincent Cassel is impressive s the generic talented but unscrupulous artistic director and Barbara Hershey as the obsessive mother whose attentions supposedly intended to push her toward glory push her toward tse brinks The movie plot seems a descendant of a famous novel by a famous ballerina now retired and running her own company DANCING ON MY GRAVE. As a ballerina's autobiography prepared to anecdote real experiences it seems truer to life but of course has not been translated to the screen. Black Swan has none of these meaning the plot elements though true to life are contrived in the creator's sequence and play out as the creator plans them. This is the shortcoming of this otherwise gripping and insightful movie.,8,1,2,2 June 2016
The Mummy," Brilliant remake of a 1930's classic
","The first Hollywood hit had Boris Karloff under the bandages primarily acting with his piercing eyes. Arnold Vosloo rocks the role in this of any remakes. The major motion picture personalities of Rachel Weisz and Brendan Frazer have style , stage presence and extrardinary chemistry. The landscape photpgraphy of a simulated ancient Egypt could not be grander or more panoramically filmed Hits all the action/adventure, tales of old myth and horror buttons as a truer classic than the famous original.",10,1,2,2 February 2019
Troy," an excellent war movie making historic fiction of a true story
","This 2004 motion picture extravaganxa has some of the finest battle scenes ever recorded on film and as among the first to make half a billion dollars in international profit. It sets scenes from Homer's ILIAD and the opening section of his ODESSY. A few historic facts about the first envy of European monarchs of the middle east with three quarters of the world's natural resources and native population are mentioned in the magnificent war film having minimal historic truth about the bronze age of history. A few name stars including Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean round a huge cast of actors not that well known today. The idea in the bronx age Troy controlled the world distribution of bronze outside the silk road th reason Agamemnon of Sparts hoped to conquer it and failed to benefit from this after he burned it is not even mentioned in the film which is why I give this fantastic war extravaganza film a 7.",7,1,2,25 June 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," Anne Hathaway jousts with Meryl Streep
","The story is supposedly an artistic license fictional biography of Anna Wintour of Vogue. Whether or not this fashion publishing icon is correctly or incorrectly pictured in the edited version is immaterial. Anne Hathaway plays a small town dreamer coming to the Big Apple for success in editorial writing and finds her entry level job as second PA to Meryl Streep playing the editor in chief of a fashion icon magazine which is supposed to satire Vogue. They are strong actresses in their own right who joust excitingly throughout the film They are supported by four strong performers. Stanley Tucci hopes to rise career wise in publishing and Adrian Grenier as a promising chef, both wised up at the final credits achieving this in Manhattan is not in the cards for them. Emily Blunt and Simon Baker play established fashion career folk at different professional levels each feverishly pursuing career perks and opportunities ultimately slipping through their fingers by the end. One assumes Hathaway's and Streep's characters will go their own ways, set their own personal goals and end up where they choose to be without stopping to smell the roses of acquiring personal cultural sophistication, a satisfying relationship and so on.",9,0,2,3 August 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A dash of STAR WARS flavored with a dash of Harry Potter
","This film of a JD Rowling novels spins some elements of her HARRY POTTER series and some of the well known STAR WARS movie series. Set in New York City between the world wars some quite fascinating travelogues of Manhattan of the era are one of the better aspects of the movie as well as some of the photographic sequences the trademark of STAR WARS and HARRY POTTER. With these fine points in mind the general storyboard and the general editing technique produces a product well below the stratospheric, top of the market standards still associated with STAR WARS and HARRY POTTER. The problem is it has none of the unexpectedly delightful storyline twists and supernatural premise elements which made the previous two series so memorable.",7,0,0,29 March 2017
To Rome With Love," Woody Allen's take on a travelogue of the charms of Rome
","We are treated to a cornucopia of people from different countries interacting in Rome to offer a beautifully edited and charming travelogue of the best of the Eternal City. The large ensemble cast is headed by a few name stars, among them Alec Baldwin, Roberto Begnigni, Penelope Cruz and Judy Davis. The storyboard seems more French than Italian art film because Woody, himself plays the generic, mature French art film male physical comic, an at first normal seeming business or professional man who soon envelopes the whole cast in chaos as he breaks out out in uncontrollable body twitches, inappropriate insults out of nowhere, impossible dreams and whatever classic French comic heroes puff up to to make their character a nut case. The French art film mode is continued by the most alluring women in the cast photographed in scenes of particular romantic allure. It becomes more typical Italian art film when most masculine guys are filmed looking embarrassed while, although 'displaying nothing', photographed in a waist wrap towel or boxer style underpants. There are some philosophic deep truths about life which move audiences and some hastily edited moments which do not unless you are hungry for a travelogue of Rome or anything Woody Allen.",7,0,2,17 August 2013
Friends with Benefits," A two directional romance whose double life impels less screen interest
","Romantic fiction often focuses on a man and woman who in lifestyle as well as personal focus seem unmatched yet by the end discover they ARE romantically marched.Social documentaries on the lifestyle of downtown Manhattan in New York City focus on traditional nuclear family units even when internally dysfunctional long moving away replaced by recent newcomers to Manhattan's downtown largely loners inside a seemingly impenetrable shell who seek out its unusual happenings without in fact becoming close to anything or anyone in their new environment. Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake could not come from more disparate backgrounds or have different lifestyles. Once deciding casual sex seems more their style than commitment he accidentally meets her family before inviting her to meet his whereupon more experienced romantic comedy film stars from Jenna Elfman as Justin's sister to Woody Harrelson as the current Boss hiring Justin seem more right for the story than do the two leads. Mila has a secretive mom who refuses to tell her when she is going to appear out of the blue, when she is going to stay awake, focused or alert or where she in fact came from. Justin is anxious for her to met his failing in health dad, his irritating, dysfunctional loner sister and a nephew whom they have taken in in California whereupon they mess things up for him. What seem,s to happen is in trying to combine romantic comedy with social media documentary it is NOT as successful as say the hit TVland show currently airing YOUNGER.",7,0,0,28 December 2016
The Mummy Returns," One of the best of its genre
","Hits all the buttons of a great action adventure movie.Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz shine as the lead couple as does the silent no lines Dwane Johnson as a recently incarnated defeated ancient warrior. Humor,. technical effects, reference to a popular legend. interesting set of scenarios from thirties London to ancient Egypt - works on every level.",10,0,1,18 February 2019
Some Like It Hot," ahead of its time and well cast
","In some ways the forerunners of fish out of water comedies and gender bending comedies more frequent in later eras. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon play poor musicians accidentally witnessing a mob mass execution during Chicago prohibition. They manage to hide out in Florida an all girl band where Tony is courted by Marilyn Monroe temporarily dressed in Florida entirely in black and white photography as a man and Jack in drag posing as a woman to avoid being executed by the mob is courted by Joe E. Brown. The comedy mounts as Tony has to convince Marilyn he is not an idle rich millionaire and Jack has to convince Joe he doesn't date males. One could expect the mob will show up in Florida to take revenge on escapees of the Valentine's day massacre and then continues to pursue Tony and Jack once they discover how they escaped dressed as women. Brilliant and enticing for its day Tony, Marily and Joe shine as they always do. Jack, who does more of the high jinx physical comedy than the other players in most of his comic films will please those who like his style but not those who think his mugging is too grand in focus for the screen. Holds up well today as a fun two hours yet not a true Golden Hollywood Classic.",7,2,3,23 April 2016
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A rare Dracula episode actually following Bram Stoker's novel
","One of this movie's strengths is Francis Ford Coppola sticking closer to the source material than do the many other versions of Gothic horror's most oft told and familiar tale. Of the four principals I find Richard E. Grant as Dr. Jack, a beloved courting Lucy the most fascinating. The other three principals, Gary Oldman, Winona Ryer and Anthony Hopkins are method actors whose style works well in the silent film type Gothic horror Coppoola creates but to me never jump across the screen to grab you as communicators Other than too much darkness on screen in a darkened theater or home entertainment room this film works perfectly.",8,2,5,1 November 2014
Jaws," A tribute to Spielberg's cinematic genius
","At the present time it is a different movie theme Spielberg invented in the same era, STAR WARS currently selling more retail gift products in the shops and screening a new movie. JAWS however has its merits and its innovations. Horror movies in which the monster makes only limited appearances without being at the center of theme is one. Cinematic portrayals of islands off Cape Cod as Martha's Vinyard is another. Every cinematic sequence shows brilliance in the way the storyline develops and in the photography, brilliant character portrayals in the minor characters and incredible rappor among the performers on screen. In its day one of the major Hollywood money makers and still in its own way modern and enthralling./",Null,2,4,15 May 2016
Music and Lyrics," romantic comedy with a unique spin
",Millennium romantic comedies tend to follow the formula of a boy and girl seeming neither right for each other nor likely to express initial interest in each other soon forced in shallow and contrived circumstance to spend time together on a project they did not choose and along the way realize they are matched. In this unique movie of this genre television personalities Kristen Johnson and Brad Garrett play scenes with movie personalities Drew Barrymore and Hugh grant who are shorter and more vivacious than they are This creates a visual and sound track interest purely the director's and photographer's genius which keep the familiar story line moving with interest and fascination. There is excellent work in the pop culture aspect well played and performed including Hugh Grant as a member.,7,0,0,25 May 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Brilliant blend of iconic movie themes
","The brilliance of this film is so many vital Hollywood themes combined into a single story line of depth and insight. More and more people today too young to retire find their life falling apart after their thirties and forties in a different economic and social climate seemed fulfilling. Michael Keaton's character has money and fame and a family and respect throughout the Broadway theater world from audiences and critics alike. Feeling unwanted because no one listens or cares without a self aggrandizing motive, perhaps a catty, stinging remark, perhaps visibly uncomfortable because they consider his stance of the moment too calm or too agitated, he depends on his new Broadway show, and in this case much like Mr. Marsh in 42ND STREET to build his confidence. It only makes him realize his time and values are over in the city as are his wife and daughter and his theater performing and directing career. Agatha Christie once wrote we feel old when no one is around to understand our hopes, dreams and memories. This is true of Keaton's fictitious character in this film, Melding memorabilia shots of New York landmarks, surrealistic editing to give us insight into his character's way to escape and gritty, realistic editing to explain the reality of staying on a job or hanging out somewhere when you are the last of the old guard, the photography and editing are insightful. Some of us go into whimsy and some plan a new life disowning familiar people, places and activities to find happiness once this seems more the norm of the fifty somethings. The movie decides which for Keaton's character though most of us find our own way out of this.",10,7,15,5 March 2015
Beowulf," a recreation of a dated and partially animated legend adventure
","Adventure legend movies in days of yore had swashbuckling heroes based on famous legends who were reworked as magnificent, brave, honorable heroes whose deeds inspired us all. The reworkings did NOT follow the legend. This is true of this remake of the Beowulf legend which tells, in middle English, of the Danish heritage today seen primarily in northern England and in East Anglia. This movie seems inspired by the old Ray Harryhausen legend rework movies as it remakes the story of Beowulf with marvelous state of the art special effects and an all too brief appearance of Angelina Jolie as a meld of many ancient pagan moon and water and earth goddesses. It will not please those who want to find out the real middle English legend or those who do not believe these old legends have any more a place in this culture. Otherwise, a good adventure movie perhaps without a target age group in mind.",6,0,1,6 March 2014
Shall We Dance," Chicago reset of a Japanese classic
","The tight ensemble cast works well together including alphabetically such familiar movie names as Bobby Canivale, Anita Gilette, Richard Gere, Richard Jenkins, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter. Its nostalgic portrayal of a Chicago I remember includes an elevated CTA train and station, the Loop, the Chicago River along Wacker Drive and a pricey visually tony section due west in the city whose residents lack the social graces expected of other tonier city neighborhoods. Its characters have the plain spoken no putting on sophisticated airs characteristic of its region of the midwest. Their day to day problems are real as are their attempts to over come the seeming mundaneness of their life in which physical comforts seem easier to grasp than sophisticated city life pleasures. This aspect lends a depth and trueness to this glorious remake other might see as a letdown from the Japanese original films in a big city culture in which plain folks see things differently.",9,1,1,3 January 2017
