10 Cloverfield Lane," Signs meets Misery
","I thought this film was really good, and surprising. For me it was like Misery meets Signs. It had mystery elements, sci-fi, thrills, and even a little horror. This movie really had me on the edge of my seat. I was constantly wondering where it was going, and I could have easily watched another hour of this. I loved how the movie mixed so many different genres together, and it's unpredictability made it a blast. The performances were all great, with John Goodman in particular hitting it out of the park. He goes from likable, to sympathetic, to straight up scary. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great too, giving her best performance yet. She also proves that she can be a bad-ass Sigourney Weaver type.Overall, I don't have any problems with it, and would recommend. Although, I didn't LOVE it, it was a fun watch.",8,2,4,14 March 2016
The Revenant," Mindblowing!
","I am left speechless by this movie. You've seen the trailers, you know how amazing it looked. Yeah, it was even better. This was easily one ofthe most visually stunning films I've ever seen. It was just mindblowing! The bear attack scene was in one long take! How amazing is that? Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic, giving a grueling physical performance. This whole movie is grueling, it's intense. This is easily one of the most brutal films I've ever seen. I never thought a movie from 2015 could get more intense than Sicario, and I was wrong. This may be the most intense movies I've seen in a long time. I can't talk about this film without mentioning Tom Hardy, who even steals the movie from Leo, with a fantastic turn as the villain. I couldn't understand half of what he was saying, but he was great! But this movie doesn't come without flaws. The plot is very simple, which I don't mind, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Hugh Glass is also a one note character. However, the character is saved by the dedication of DiCaprio, who just brings his all to the performance. This movie isn't for everyone, but I feel like it's something everyone should see at least once.Alejandro González Iñárritu has made 2 films in a row that have completely blown me away. I seriously can't wait to see what he'll do next. I can see him becoming one of the greatest directors of our time.9.5/10",10,0,3,10 January 2016
Room," This was incredible! MUST SEE!
","I had no idea what I was in store for when I saw this film. This is a phenomenal piece of cinema. Words can't describe how incredible this film is. It's a masterpiece. I've never seen a film dealt with in such a realistic way. This film was an emotional roller-coaster, I was in tears many times throughout this movie. This film has the best acting of the year. Brie Larson gives the best female performance in years. Who surprised me the most was Jacob Tremblay, who gives easily one of the greatest child performances I've ever seen. Joan Allen is great as well, and I expect all of them to get Oscar nominations. In no way was I expecting to be as engaged as I was in this film, because I was absolutely mesmerized. Lenny Abrahamson's directing is incredible. He allows you to really understand these characters, and you feel all the emotion and passion poured on-screen. This film is heartbreaking, but heartwarming at the same time. I guarantee anyone who sees this will cry. It's incredible. I hope it wins Best Picture, it deserves it. This is the best film so far this year, 9.8/10.",9,2,11,22 November 2015
Steve Jobs," Really Enjoyable!
","This movie is so fantastic. As Sorkin goes, not quite as good as The Social Network, but probably up there with Moneyball. I loved this. I think this movie really lets you get to know Steve Jobs. Yoh actually understand him. You go in thinking he was just an asshole, and it portrays him that way. Though you understand his character, and he isn't just completely unlikeable, which I expected him to be. Michael Fassbender plays Jobs perfectly, and gives him an incredible performance, probably his best since Shame. Kate Winslet is incredible as well, and honestly just as good as Fassbender. I honestly see her winning best supporting actress. I had no idea her character was from Poland, and she nails the accent perfectly. It's her best performance in years. Seth Rogen was also great as Steve Wozniak, and probably his best performance, but not quite Oscar- caliber. I also have to talk about Danny Boyle's directing, which is magnificent. It's just as stylish as always, but never distracting. In case you guys didn't know, this film is essentially 3 long scenes that take place before the launch of a major apple product, with a few flashbacks in between. Danny Boyle shot each scene differently, as the tech world evolutionized. The first scene was shot in 16 mm, the second in 35 mm, and the last in digital. This seems gimmicky, but it works so well.You'd think that a movie that's just 3 long scenes would be boring, but the film has so much energy and intensity. I loved every second of it. I was engaged in the film, my eyes were glued to the screen. There was a scene in the film, where Jobs goes into the bathroom and looks in the mirror, and I literally thought for a second I was going to see a reflection of myself in the mirror. THAT'S how engaging it is. I totally forgot I was watching a movie. This is a 9.5/10 for me. I definitely recommend it.",8,1,5,23 October 2015
The Big Short," Surprisingly fun ride!
","This is one of the best films of the year, hands down. It was just incredible. This film takes a subject matter that could be considered boring by some, and totally draws you into it. It finds creative ways to break everything down for the audience, and makes it entertaining. I love how it's self aware, even at some points straight up going, 'This isn't how it happened, but it's way more interesting this way.' I love how it breaks the 4th wall, with celebrities who make cameos to explain complicated things to the audience. It's brilliant. I left this movie angry that this happened, it really gets you thinking. Adam Mckay's script is fantastic. The characters are very well written, which every one being interesting and well developed. The film effortlessly blends comedy with drama, one minute making you laugh out loud, and and then it stops you right in it's tracks. There are some really heartbreaking moments here. The acting is just phenomenal, and this is Steve Carell's best performance. It's just incredible. If he's not nominated an Oscar for this, it's robbery. It's easily better than his Foxcatcher performance. Christian Bale is great as well, playing the socially awkward Michael Burry. Brad Pitt with his limited screen time was great as well. Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer here, he's hilarious. He's really the only character not struggling here, he's making money off all of it. This movie is extremely stylish, with brilliant editing that I hope wins it an Oscar. This film does everything it can to make everything fun, and it does a great job. This is as entertaining as it is thought provoking. Adam Mckay should tackle drama more often, as he did an extraordinary job with this. 9.5/10",9,35,44,10 January 2016
Straight Outta Compton," Go see if you're an NWA fan, or a movie fan in general!
","I loved LOVED LOVED this movie!!!! NWA was always my favorite rap group so this movie was just a blast for me. This movie definitely exceeded my expectations. This is among one of the best biopics I've ever seen. This has drama, comedy, action, thrills, and above all, and incredible soundtrack! I was also surprised at how well directed this was. It's got to be the best thing F. Gary Gray has ever done. The cinematography for this movie was surprisingly gorgeous, especially for the earlier scenes that take place in the 80's. It just has this beautiful golden glow that was just incredible. considering the cast of school the bunch of unknowns I thought the acting wasn't going to be the best.....it turns out that it was fantastic!!!! Everybody in the film gives a great performance! Even in the emotional scenes, they deliver. There is some great talent in this film and I feel like these actors should get recognized after this film. Paul Giamatti was great as usual. Only problem for me was that MC Ren's character was underdeveloped. Maybe he wasn't as popular as Dre, E, and Cube, but he felt sort of left out of the drama. We get to know every character in the movie (even DJ Yella), but Ren was just kinda there. Either way, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. This is a 9.5/10 for me.",8,17,54,14 August 2015
