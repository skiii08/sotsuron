Changeling," Good movie don't read what it is about 1st
","Wifey and I got this on PPV she was talking about it and I thought I knew what it was about so I prepared for it for about a week. We bought it and I was tricked! What I thought was going to happen didn't happen exactly as I thought. So it turned out to be a good movie. Because it is a true story I have to say, it is good, in a bad way, that abductions occurred before rock music and R rated movies. Overall the was good and it seemed to show life as pretty nicein the burbs of LA In the 20's. I think Angelina did OK acting but she wasn't that strong. Then again I can't say who I would put in her place. It needed to be someone strong with an attitude when needed. A word to the wise for Angelina- don't leave any of those adopted kids you have home alone until they are about 15.",7,1,4,23 March 2009
