The Blair Witch Project," Sorry, not scary. I didn't get it.
","While I applaud the spirit of this film, it never 'took off' for me. I kept waiting for the scary part and found the film rather tedious. . .the lead actress more annoying than anything else. I can't recommend it and am amazed at all the fuss. This film would seem to be more about successful marketing than successful story telling.",1,0,2,15 August 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Huge disappointment
","The first was delightfully inventive, subversive and thoroughly entertaining. The follow-up, sadly, is a bloated and confused mess. Giving Depp little to work with, the strong lead character who drives the initial film has not evolved. This time around Sparrow's been reduced to a role of lesser import and, painfully, one comprised primarily of repetitive buffoonery. Too many under-developed characters and a convoluted plot, the sequel relies on CG histrionics to sustain energy and fails miserably, collapsing under its own weight. Bill Nighy is terrific, easily giving the film's best performance. But Dead Man's Chest simply crumbles down around him and commits a film's worst sin: it becomes tedious and ultimately boring. Of course, none of this matters one whit. Marketed to a fair-thee-well, this film has become a must-see event that has transcended the need to be an artistic success. Matrix 2 and 3 anyone?",4,3,5,14 August 2006
The Sixth Sense," Good, but no cigar
","Much like Bruce's 'Color of Night,' this one exists to serve its ending . ..and is ultimately less satisfying than the popular hype and success. Bruce was restrained ( good ). . . and the kid has abilities beyond his years. The young actor is the reason for seeing this one, not necessarily the creaky and oft-times slow plot.",6,0,0,26 August 1999
The Matrix," Unrealized potential
","This film had the look and effects and the action. . .but lacked in story and humanity. It failed to follow-thorough in execution to become the satisfying science fiction tale it intended. The result was a comic book sketch of a film, rather than a fully realized one.  'Dark City' was a superior film in this genre that did accomplish a similar goal.",Null,0,0,23 September 1999
