Iron Man 3," It's got some serious issues ... but I still really like it. :-)
","So to start off I want to say that I really like this film ... and I recognize that it has some pretty glaring consistency issues.A lot of people hated the Mandarin twist ... I liked it. I don't think that's an issue but then I never read the comics. My issues have to do with logic and consistency.The first big issue is the inconsistency on the new suit that 'codes' to Tony.So Tony has to implant a bunch of electrodes in his arm to make the suit reassemble on him ... but then with a couple arm movements he's able to put it on Pepper? Then later Rhodes asks for a suit and Tony says 'they're only coded to me' ... but then he again does the movements and puts the whole suit on Killian???? If he has to 'code' the suits then how can he just arbitrarily transfer them with a couple arm waves to anyone he wants? And if he can put the suits on anyone why was he implanting electrodes in his arm? For the conducting?? Anyway ... weird.OK so next is Iron Patriot ... AIM apparently did the upgrade on War Machine to turn him into Iron Patriot. And they were able to program it to encapsulate the president, fly and deliver him to Killian. So why didn't they also build in an override to bring Rhodes to them? Or an 'open sesame' button to pop Rhodes out of it? They do all the work, they built in override capability, having the suit was completely necessary to their plan ... so why did they have to create an elaborate ruse to capture Rhodes? And then all the heating to get him out of the suit? Why not just push a button and it spits out Rhodes and brings the suit directly to them? Would've been easier.Oh and quick side note: what was with Rhodes able to active the blasters from the outside while he's rescuing the president? Seriously you can do that ... cuz that seems like a SERIOUS design flaw. Anyway ...Ok and then lastly is the suped-up soldiers and Killian and the various ways to kill them ... or not kill them. So with the primary bad dude soldier: a 3000 celsius blast DOESN'T kill him ... a blast to the head DOESN'T kill him ... burning, gunshots, nope and nope. But a laser to the chest kills him? Why does that work? Their heart has to be destroyed to destroy them? If that's true why doesn't blowing up work? Or fire? How does that make sense? Then later during the final battle fight the super-soldiers ARE taken out by explosions? I mean the Iron Legion had to have taken them all out because there aren't any left by the end ... it's unclear HOW they accomplish this but we do see some of them exploding and it appears to be working.But then we get to Killian ... dismemberment doesn't work, punches, blasts, nothing. Then Tony puts a suit on him and explodes it ... that should do it right? NOPE. Somehow still alive until Pepper explodes him a second time ... so two explosions work???Yeah and let's not forget Pepper ... falls 200 feet into fire ... and survives. So it just makes absolutely no sense at all ... seemed like the movie writers were just making it up as they went along and just shrugged at the end and said ... whatever ... people will still like it.And hey ... they were right. :-)",8,0,0,27 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Most of these reviews were posted before the film even hit theaters
","Suspicious much? I on the other hand thought this movie was really fun. It's one of the weaker Marvel films to be sure ... but I thought the AntMans or Thor 2 were both far weaker and I liked this one more than Black Panther. I loved Brie Larson, I loved her character, and it was AWESOME to finally see a truly badass female superhero. Like truly badass ... like I-wanna-see-Captain-Marvel-vs-Superman-cuz-I-think-she-could-take-him badass. It's about freaking time!AMAZING soundtrack ... all the 90's stuff was really fun (especially if you were alive during the 90's) and there were several laugh out loud moments. Was it super cornball at times ... sure. Were some of the 'reveals' kinda hooky? Absolutely. But this was overall a solid, fun, film. My husband and I both left the theater smiling.Haters need to get a life.",8,1,3,9 March 2019
Ready Player One," Boring and predictable
","It's Willy Wonka meets Avatar set in the world of Idiocracy with a hundred pop culture references thrown in. There's nothing new here. The leads are un-engaging, the story has been done a thousand times before, and the dialogue is just embarrassing. There's nothing to draw you in, nothing to connect you to the characters, nothing to make you care about this world. Even the special effects aren't anything new.Remember when Spielberg used to make GOOD movies?? It gets 2 stars because I didn't turn it off mid-way but I was bored most of the time. Probably the video-game generation will love it but for those of us who grew up in the REAL world it's a snooze fest. Do yourself a favor and watch Wreck-It-Ralph ... a very similar story done FAR FAR BETTER.",2,0,2,18 August 2018
Justice League," It wasn't horrible ...
","I've definitely seen superhero mashups be worse. Mostly this just felt like a not-as-good-Avengers. The thing with superhero mashups is that there isn't a lot of time for character development. Characters can have arcs but they have to be small ones so we need to know the characters beforehand so we can care about them. So DC messed up in that we only really knew Superman and Wonder Woman. We knew a little about Batman from the Batman vs Superman movie but not really. So that's half the characters we have absolutely no history with when this film starts ... that's a lot of gaps to fill.Justice League tries, but the characters all feel flat even the ones who previously had stories and personalities. I'm not sure what happened but we get zero development, zero personality ... just deadpan performances all the way around. Add to that, pretty terrible CGI. Then there's fact that Superman makes the rest of them seem useless. I thought the Flash was supposed to be faster than Superman? I thought Wonder Woman was supposed to share Superman's level of strength? Batman seems especially useless in this film ... like he gets them all together but he's old and clunky in his suit and can't fight worth a damn. Aquaman I just don't get. He lives in the water ... there's some jokes that he talks to fish ... he's strong? But we don't get to see him flex his water muscles, he does most of his fighting on land, he's got his trident thing but he basically just uses it as a pitch fork. So I don't get it. And as soon as Superman shows up it looks as though he could've single-handedly taken out the big bad. Like he wasn't working hard at all which made the defeat of Steppenwolf extremely unsatisfying.So yeah ... not awful but just kind of meh.",6,0,0,29 March 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Better upon a second viewing
","OK so I always struggle with time travel as a plot device. Mostly because I consider it to be lazy in terms of the story writing ... don't like how the ending went? ... we'll go back in time and undo it! It's LAZY.And when I saw Endgame in the theaters I LOVED the beginning and they kill Thanos and I'm thinking 'ok he destroyed the stones ... how are they going to undo this?' and then they go 'TIME TRAVEL' and my heart just sank. So the first time through I missed a LOT due to being bummed out. And I walked out of the theater with a disgruntled smirk.However ... the second time, I had a chance to pause and rewind when Dr Hulk explains the time travel rules and, to my surprise, they actually do make sense.
Which made me far less irritated when he explained why they couldn't just go back and kill baby Thanos. And with that part making better sense I was able to pay more attention to the other bits that bothered me the first time and upon second viewing I realized that they actually did a pretty decent job of telling the story and nearly everything lined up.I still have bones to pick ... for instance, it was purely coincidence that Nat and Hawkeye went to Vormir? Cuz if Nebula and Rodi had gone then they would've been screwed. Seriously nobody knew the trick to getting the soul stone but they sent nearly the only pair that could make it work? Just dumb luck? OK ... fine. And I don't understand why the 4 had to land on Morag and then split up ... but ok. And then Captain America going back in time wouldn't have messed up his own timeline but he would've messed with Peggy's. Wouldn't that mean he would end up on a different trajectory? So he wouldn't have ended up on that bench at the end?See this is the problem with time travel.And I was disappointed by some missed opportunities. What I loved about Infinity War was the mash-ups of the different worlds, the characters meeting and collaborating. And with the exception of Nebula there weren't really that many mash-ups. I would've loved more Okoye ... even some Okoye would've been nice. She was relegated to 1 scene and then the end ... bummer. I would've loved a lot more Rocket. I think it would've been better if they'd left Shuri alive and had her contribute to the science since that part of Infinity War was awesome. And more Captain Marvel of course though I know why they did what they did with her ...All of that being said, the final battle is one of the greatest things I've ever watched. I loved it both times and wanted to watch it again immediately after finishing which means I'll likely watch this film several more times.Endgame is a wonderful conclusion to an outstanding film series ... the most epic ever attempted. And while it's not perfect it's still very well done.",8,1,3,24 November 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Utter garbage
","I understand that Disney is in to this game to make money. And this movie did make money ... outside the US. And deservedly so ... it's a horrible horrible mess of a plot, terrible dialog, Jack's personality has been reduced to 'drunk guy', the new characters are unexciting and lack both chemistry and charisma. Not to mention the complete waste of talent... bringing Kiera Knightly back for a hug and a kiss? I hope she charged them $10M for that.Disney spent $230M on this picture ... why couldn't they get a decent script? It continues to be my issue with pretty much everything that Disney puts out. Why are their scripts such garbage? It's the cheapest part of the entire production. Why can't they do it better? This script wasn't even that terrible it just needed some good editing. A few tweaks here and there and it could've been great.So why not do that? Why not hire some good script editors, make a movie that's actually GOOD and make even MORE money? Why not make a movie that doesn't get immediately panned by critics, is a huge splash in the US, and STILL kills overseas? Sounds like definitely the way to go. And yet ... With this much money there's no excuse to make crap movies and yet Disney has made this their MO. So they have fabulous effects, decent actors, and just sh*t stories. Apparently they don't care.",2,1,1,20 January 2018
Logan," Close to perfect
","Gorgeously tragic, deeply moving, a perfect end for an amazing hero. Beautifully acted and written, possibly the greatest of all the Xmen films.The only complaint I have is when the doctor 'monologues' at the end ... even though it's nice to know about the evil plot to end the mutants the movie could've ended without the ridiculous speech and we still would've loved it. In fact leaving a big hanging question mark over what happened to all the mutants would've worked just fine.",9,1,2,29 March 2018
La La Land," A musical with no memorable music and talentless actors ... how is this a hit?!?
","Musicals don't necessarily have to have leading stars who can sing and dance. Frank Sinatra was no great dancer but managed to hold his own, Rene Zellweger was dwarfed next to Catherine Zeta, and Christian Bale's Santa Fe ballad complete with cowboy dance in Newsies is downright laughable, hell Rex Harrison SPOKE his songs rather than sing them ... BUT given incredible music we the audience can forgive a lot. That being said, it's not like Hollywood is hurting for actors who can both sing AND dance. Neil Patrick Harris and Kristen Bell both immediately spring to mind. Now if you'd paired those two in La La Land you MIGHT be able to overlook the huge glaring flaw in this musical: the fact that the music STINKS.5 minutes in I was bored ... I was supposed to be wowed with a huge musical opening number ala 'All that Jazz', 'Carrying the Banner', 'Sweeney Todd', or 'Singing in the Rain' and instead I couldn't tell you the title of the song and I couldn't have been less blown away by the opening dance number. BORING.Then we meet our protagonists and ... I couldn't care less about either of them. At 15 minutes in I was ready to bail out but I figured I should at least hear Gosling sing and see both of them dance before I called it. Man am I sorry I waited. At 30 minutes in we finally get to the first big song/dance number and it just really could not have sucked worse if it were a preschool production. If that was all the singing required, couldn't they have cast Channing Tatum? I'm sure his voice could have been auto tuned as much as Gosling's and he's an excellent dancer. Everyone made fun of Helena Bonham Carter's Ms. Lovett because of her airy nothing of a voice ... well Emma wishes she had the lung capacity of Ms Carter. Midway through the train wreck of the first musical number I couldn't take any more. If I'd seen it in a theater I'd have demanded my money back. I heard there's some good John Legend moments ... I'll just try to find them on youtube. So Hollywood casts not 1 but 2 actors who can't sing or dance worth a lick in a musical with utterly bland and completely forgettable music. How is this rated 8.6 stars? Why is this film not overwhelmingly panned by critics? Is this what passes for good from Hollywood now? Because if so they should just turn in the keys because the whole place is bound to go down in flames any second.",1,5,9,27 October 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Stiff, uneven, and preachy!
","I knew it was going to be bad when the film opened to a horrendously auto-tuned Emma Watson. Why ... when Hollywood is TEEMING with incredibly gifted actors who can both sing and dance ... do they insist time and again on casting actors ... in MUSICALS ... who can do neither? Maybe Emma looked the part of Belle ... but that's all she resembles in the character. She lacks the confidence, charisma, spark, and energy of the animated Belle and her vocals are downright puny. Luke Evans has the talent for Gaston, Josh Gad is fine as LeFou, Ian McGregor while not sounding French in the slightest at least has the vocal talent for Lumiere ... if they had to have Emma why not dub her over like they did for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady?? And then, I understand that Gaston is the narcissistic, brutish, mysoginist, obsessed and stalking Belle ... not taking 'no' for an answer... he's the bad guy, I get it. And we the audience are shown why we should dislike him within his first 30 seconds on screen. But his first interaction with Belle is odd to say the least. He approaches her with a lovely bouquet of flowers, and politely asks her to dinner. She looks at him with a disgusted incredulous look and says 'no.' It's unclear whether this is the first time 1. she's met him or 2. he's asked her out. But if either of those things are true ... Belle was kinda b****y to the guy. I'm a woman, she's free to say no for whatever reason she wants, but if a guy brought me flowers and nicely asked me to dinner I'd at least attempt not to grimace. I know this guy's a jerk and he vows to keep pursuing her which is a total d**k move, but their first encounter doesn't give her any reason to be hostile, and even their second encounter feels like she's overreacting. The movie doesn't make me hate/loathe Gaston enough to want to see him treated badly ... which Belle does. And it makes me dislike her, not him.Actually Emma feels stiff in the whole movie, it's almost like they bad cgi-d her to mimic realistic movements so everything looks unnatural.And perhaps worst is Disney with their ham-fisted political messages. It's not enough for Belle to be the quirky odd-ball because she's smart and enjoys reading ... now she ALSO has to be an advocate for female equality and secretly teaching girls to read. An issue I totally agree with, but why does it have to be done so sanctimoniously and heavy-handed?Belle's father stopping to get the rose was STUPID. You escape the wolves and the creepy possessed castle but then have to stop for a rose? I think your daughter would understand with your life and safety on the line if you forget her damned flower. Her dad deserved to get caught. And why they chose to cast Kevin Kline as Belle's father I really don't understand. He wasn't a crackpot scientist, he wasn't a zany kook, and he wasn't even that convincing as a loving father ... he wasn't endearing on any level.The beast is too cartoony to be frightening, I'm sorry but Emma Thompson (whom I love) is just no Angela Lansbury. The beast's backstory was unnecessary melodramatic drivel. Belle's backstory was just depressing and made us lose focus from the primary story. The plot just meanders all over the place, it's an absolute mess and everything dilutes from the primary plot line so it loses all its potency by the end. Some of the singing talent in this film is absolutely outstanding which only highlights how terrible the leads are. I don't understand why you'd need famous actors for roles that are 90% CGI ... why not get stronger vocal talent? It would have vastly improved the film.There are some moments that are stunningly beautiful and proof of the magic that can be real-life vs animated films ... but they are few, far between, and never at the right moments. The musical numbers never even approach magical which is really disappointing as those were most of the high points in the animated version.The crescendos all fall flat, the whole film feels anti-climactic. Nothing builds, there's no momentum. The pacing of the movie is all over the place, some parts way too slow and other things felt rushed. This film tries to distinguish itself from its animated predecessor but it's like Disney forgot that many consider Beauty and the Beast to be the best of all the animated Disney films. Every change they made only served to make it worse.The animated film is vastly superior. Don't bother with this one.",3,1,1,10 March 2018
Kong: Skull Island," What a mess
","This film can't decide what it is. First it wants to be Aliens: send a bunch of badass military dudes to rid the world of horrible monsters. Then it tries to be Jurassic Park: scientists dealing with out of control ancient species. And then it goes all Heart of Darknessy/Apocolypse Now with Samuel L. losing his sh**. And by the end it's Predator: human against alien species revenge for killing his men flick. But it doesn't do any of them well and the entire thing ends up feeling completely unnecessary. They go to the island (which has been actively avoided since the beginning of time) to protect the world from the 'monsters' who live there. What? The things never leave the island ... nobody's ever seen them ... but we need to destroy them before they destroy us. Right ... Then the first thing they do once they reach this pristine untouched wilderness is drop a bunch of bombs on it. And when Kong comes out to defend the island he's branded a 'monster' and they go immediately to 'KILL IT!' Which in the end gets a lot of men killed ... oh but that's Kong's fault. Hey genius, how bout you turn the choppers around when the big monster comes ... run away ... save more men. But no ... Kong is the bad one.Then they encounter a huge spider thing who's just strolling along and minding its own business ... it accidentally skewers a dude with one of its legs ... and instead of running away or hiding ... no they start shooting and hacking its legs off. So it defends itself ... kills more guys ... and they wind up butchering the poor thing ... probably the only one of its kind in the world.So the military just stomps through destroying land and killing endangered species and calling themselves the good guys. And the Colonel gets WAY more guys killed going on his revenge mission than would've if he'd actually thought about the health and safety of his men. So is this supposed to be an anti-war film?And then the film segues to a soldier who dropped there in WW2 and a strange mute civilization that worships Kong and then evil skull crusher lizards. So now you're really on Kong's team cuz he's like the protector of the people. Which is all just gearing up for the big showdown between Kong and head lizard which Kong wins of course. And then there's the eyeroll-worthy push for the freaking 'monster-universe' at the end ... gag. Ugh, Hollywood is just a bunch of greedy garbage pushers at this point. And they're so shameless about it. So yeah ... 2 stars.",2,1,2,4 February 2018
Black Panther," Not my favorite Marvel film
","I had heard that Black Panther was supposed to be excellent so I was excited to see it. I think I can understand, having a movie about Africa that ISN'T about slavery, genocide, apartheid, AIDS, war lords, or child soldiers is kind of unheard of ... and in that light this film is awesome. I applaud the long list of strong female characters present in this film. And they got the freaking A-List for this film, the acting talent was unimpeachable. My issue with this film is the story: they used such a generic and overly used storyline which was DEEPLY disappointing. The plot is just a superhero version of the Lion King which we all know got its plot from Hamlet. It made me feel like a movie I'd already seen 15 times before and that really bummed me out.Meanwhile the film is populated with all these interesting characters and a new country and culture that we never find out much about. Who are the Dora Milaje? How did it come to be that Wakanda is protected by a group of badass bald females? What's with the hand to hand combat to determine the next king? What's the significance of the masks? Why does that mountain tribe worship Hanuman (whose roots are Hindu)? Why is the mountain tribe all trouble-making? What's the deal with the Wakandan spy missions all over the world? What's with the lip tattoos? Why do they glow like that? How do they get them? Are they hereditary or what?Or how about just more history on the relationships between the primary cast? What's the story between T'Challa and Nakia? Was Shuri born a child prodigy or was she trained to be head of technology? What's the deal between Okoye and W'Kabi? Are they lovers? Married? What? And what's T'Challa's relationship with W'Kabi? Did they grow up together? Are they best friends? We're told extremely little about any of these people and we're just supposed to infer everything based on a few random interactions.So I was left not feeling very much for these characters as they jump from action scene to action scene to action scene to ... yawn. Plus, there was nothing new to the action sequences ... and it's just all been done before so many times I got bored. THEN, add to that, I'm not even sure WHEN this movie is supposed to be taking place. During Civil War? After Civil War? Because if it's during Civil War ... like after the father was killed and before Bucky was brought to Wakanda ... then it blows the big is-T'Challa-dead part of the film because we know he has to live to go after Bucky. If it's after Civil War then why did they say in Civil War that T'Challa was king? It's sloppy stuff like this that makes me crazy.And lastly, the film felt tonally off from the other films ... and not in a good way like Thor Ragnarok. It's like this film couldn't decide what tone to take, so it was part storytelling/fantastic/mythology ... then part gritty/urban/dark ... then part glossy/tech-heavy/action flick. If it had just picked ONE of those and stuck with it I probably would've loved it but instead it was a mishmash and didn't do any of them well and left the whole thing feeling off.I give it a 7 because I didn't really dislike the film, and for me even a so-so Marvel film is still way better than most movies Hollywood makes today. But I was disappointed. I wanted better and it's a shame that this film didn't get a richer, unique story to do credit to the acting talent and overall opportunity that existed in the making of this film.",7,3,5,17 May 2018
The Greatest Showman," One word ... saccharine
","Forget the songs that all sound the same and were CLEARLY written before there was a film (you can tell by the vagueness of the lyrics and how some of them don't make any sense in the context of the film). Forget the overly auto-tuned vocalists even ones who don't need to be auto-tuned!! Forget the multitude of under developed or one-dimensional characters we're never given a chance to care about. Even forget the constant moralistic hammering of equality equality EQUALITY into every single freaking scene.The overwhelming feeling of this film is ... in one word ... saccharine. As in NAUSEATINGLY sweet. Sappy. Mawkish. There's no real drama no real heart, and the film makes it impossible to believe that anything will get these spunky go-getters down for too long. PUKE.Look I didn't hate it ... it wasn't nearly as bad as La La Land which I had to turn off within 30 minutes because it was so terrible. I DID end up fast forwarding through the songs after 3rd or 4th one because there was nothing gained by them and I have a life.Maybe that's the bar: if you liked La La Land ... you'll probably like this. If you thought La La Land was irredeemable dreck then definitely do not waste your time on this movie.",3,3,7,8 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A New Hope recycled
","Just to warn you, this whole review is one big long spoiler. So SPOILER ALERT!Everyone can save their time watching TFA  just watch A New Hope again. It's THE SAME MOVIE. Lucas recycled everything from the characters to the plot only we get lamer next generations of the original characters. Poe is the new Han, Rey is the new Luke, Kylo is the new Vader, Supreme being is the new Emperor, Luke is the new Obi-Wan, and BB-8 is the new R2. Even the groups are the same: the New Order is the new Evil Empire, the Resistance are the new Rebels complete with base on forested planet. Opening: Poe gets a disc with important information intended for the Resistance which he hides in a droid. The enemy unexpectedly show up so he sends the droid away. Poe then gets captured and tortured for information until he gets rescued. The droid after wandering the desert dune planet for a while gets picked up by a local girl, who doesn't know it, but she's actually the new hero. She figures out the droid is important and meant for the Rebels  I mean sorry the 'Resistance', so together they hightail it off her desert planet home. Sounding familiar yet?Meanwhile the bad guys have built the Starkiller base, (basically Death Star the next generation) and they use it to destroy a planet very original.So then the rag-tag group get to the resistance base, they download the droid, they find that the death star thing has a weakness that is in this one exposed spot, they launch an attack, the father figure gets killed by Vader 2, and they blow the new Death Star thing up.Tell me that's not the entire plot of A New Hope.It's really inexcusable to me that with as much money as Lucas makes on these films he can't get any decent writers to create an original script. Fans of the movies will likely always be fans and will like this movie anyway because they'll get all nostalgic about seeing their old characters brought back. But the film is just lazy in its execution. There's nothing new here.",3,21,31,23 December 2015
