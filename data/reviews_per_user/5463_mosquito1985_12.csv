Antz," Great Animation.
","I have watched this film in the cinema about three of four times; and it was a fun thing to do each of those times. Antz is jam-packed with great animation, jokes and well thought out story lines. I have now got this film on video tape now. You should really do the same thing too.",8,0,0,28 March 2003
Rocky V," Sad ending.
",Rocky retires due to brain damage by russian boxer Ivan Drago. Good film but lacks some of the magic of the previous films. Rocky finds out that he is in seriously in the red when Paulie signs the power of attorney to a dumb solicitor. To make ends meet Rocky has to sell his possessions and his mansion in an auction and returns to Philadelphia. Later on he trains new comer Tommy Gunn.,5,1,2,11 June 2003
Predator," Nothing like it in earth's history.
","Predator tells a tale of suburban commando's who trespasses into the vietnamese jungle where something alien is lurking. Combined by special effects, the art work on the costume of the predator is amazing. Gory scenes are shown which should not be shown to younger viewers. Predator's sequel is terrible.",8,0,0,11 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Even better than the first Harry Potter film.
",The first of three Lord of the Rings trilogy is action packed. Especially for a film which is nearly three hours long. Comparing it with the first Harry Potter was a hard decision. But this film was just better. The special effects are completely priceless and the action is very realistic and entertaining. Do not ignore this film.,9,0,0,11 June 2003
Rocky IV," Rocky's toughest time.
","Rocky has his toughest challenge yet. Dolph Lundgren who plays Ivan Drago is a new boxer who is so powerful because of his use to steroids along with his russian freinds. Apollo fights him but dies, which is always nasty to see. Then rocky fights him. But anyway this film's storyline is excellent but drags on. Good sequel but not excellent.",7,0,0,11 June 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Good sequel. Very well thought out.
","Jurassic park 2 was very thought out an d impressed me greatly when i went to watch this film in the pictures. Judging this film to be poor because it is a sequel, the directors at Universal Studios proved me wrong. You really need to see this movie first if you want to see JP3. One of the best sequels i have seen. Not pleased about JP3 though.",6,1,2,11 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A good sequel, but I have one question to ask.
","Yes, i have one question - where and what in the hell are the 'Two Towers'? The film did not answer that question at all! Also, it was a pity that the Fellowship did not re-unite. However, this was still a solid gold sequel and the action, drama and the excellent battle scene easily compensates the two faults I have commented about. To achieve another 10 out of 10; The Return of the King (The 3rd film) must re-unite the Fellowship and explain everything in thorough detail!!; and I mean thorough. I do declare that I rate this movie 9 out of 10 because of the two faults and the compensation of it's excellent and detailed content.",9,0,0,2 April 2003
Dumb and Dumber," Very funny and original.
",Dumb and Dumber is excellent and will guarantee you a satisfactory watching of the movie. Dumb and Dumber is packed with funny gags and idiotic scenes. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play very good parts in this movie and they both deserve there pay checks.,8,0,2,2 April 2003
A Clockwork Orange," 1970's english film masterpiece!
","A Clockwork Orange is indeed one of the best films that Stanley Kubrick has ever made. It was a pity it was banned for 27 years. When i first saw this movie i was very puzzled and somewhat confused, and now i have seen it lots of times now i understood it. Also, you will understand the storyline and also appreciate the actors brilliant skills in their performance. The cast is good but their is a lot of wasted short and small roles used. But, the film is excellent and strange anyway.",8,0,0,11 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Truly Excellent. You must see it.
","This film is most probably the best sequel I have ever seen. The special effects of the film is truly awesome. The Car Chase is absolutely crazy and the fight in the Park between Neo and the Agent Smith Clones is phenomenal. This film is easily worth your cinema money, so watch it. You do not know what you're missing!",7,0,0,30 May 2003
The Green Mile," Stephen King wrote this?
","I was suprised that Stephen King wrote the novel and the script for this film. Anyway, i immediately prejudged this film to be boring because it was three hours long (according to the tape case). I was so wrong. The green mile was definitely the best three hours long i spent for watching a movie. Filled with anxiety, violence and humour this movie is a definite non-misser, and deserves a place in the IMDb top 250 films.",8,1,3,11 June 2003
Jurassic Park," Brilliant Dinosaurs!
",When i first saw this movie when i was 8 years old (I was born in 1985)i wasn't going to be prepared for what happened. I was stunned to see such great special effects. Especially near the beginning where you saw herds of dinosaurs. If you want to see JP2 it is best to see JP1 first.,7,1,3,11 June 2003
