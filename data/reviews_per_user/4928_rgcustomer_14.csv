The King's Speech," Considerably over-rated, but a good film
","I should start off and say that this is not a bad film. I enjoyed it, about as much as I enjoyed Tron Legacy, which is to say it's a pleasant way to spend your afternoon, if you have nothing else important to do that day.And I should commend the director for his public commitment to historical accuracy. So many filmmakers think they're smarter than history, and proclaim themselves geniuses for inventing this and deleting that, but it takes a true talent to take what actually happened (to the degree anyone can know) without making it boring or confusing on the screen.The last of my praises should go to Colin Firth, who I didn't even recognize in the role.Unfortunately, the film suffers from being set in the 1930s. Its biggest fans are those with the blue hair, who are reliving their childhoods, a time of war and uncertain futures. Everyone knows how the film is going to turn out. The thrill seems to be mostly about identifying various cameo appearances: 'Ooh, that's Churchill!!1!1!!' they shout (you can almost hear the '1's).What the story lacks is character. The king-to-be describes himself as a naval officer rather than a king, but we never see him doing anything remotely naval-ly, and it's just a little hard to believe this man would be given a command of anything more important than his own hat. What are we to make of this? The man also describes his childhood, but it's never shown to us in flashback, so we don't really get the emotion of it. That would have helped, as apparently this is meant to be the origin of his stutter. Last, he apparently managed to marry someone and reproduce. It's not believable. Obviously, it happened, but we deserve to know how. Who would marry someone so totally incompetent? She did say she didn't want him to have the throne, but I imagine being a royal relative, even without the throne, comes with all sorts of perks.As for the end, it's completely predictable, and not just because of history. I could hardly spoil history, but I checked the spoiler box anyway. The speech therapist is thanked. The 'I helped the royals' genre always ends this way. We're always supposed to be so moved that a royal would dare to acknowledge a positive feeling for someone. It's like a little victory for the audience, over the royalty. Whether it's Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The Golden Age (both also with Geoffrey Rush) or The Queen (2006) or Mrs Brown, we've seen it time and again. Even Babe ('that'll do, pig') and Return of the King ('you bow to no one') are variants of this genre.The worst part though is that it's extremely difficult to get excited about a man reading a speech. He's not even making a speech, just reading it, with help. I suppose the ordinariness of it is supposed to be moving, but it just isn't. All the tension disappears from the film with the first visit to the speech therapist, where a voice recording is made. Right there is the solution to all the problems. Rather than hiding away in a separate room to force out the speech, he could simply have recorded the speech (without the odd gaps) and played back the recording. In a pinch, he could skip the recording altogether, and simply use the headphone music as he spoke. Anyway, do see the film, but don't expect it to be a masterpiece.",7,9,20,28 December 2010
Changeling," A True Story -- NOT!
","Once again, we sit through a 2-hour-plus film that doesn't just claim to be based on a true story, but is actually 'A True Story' period, only to learn that we've been lied to.When you make 'A True Story', the audience expects that the significant facts should be in the film. Of course there will be fiction in the film, but it should be insignificant stuff.What the audience doesn't expect is that the key villain in 'A True Story', the murderer, would in fact be someone else.While Gordon was executed for murdering two boys and a ranch hand, Walter wasn't one of them. The film completely leaves out the rather important fact that Gordon's mother Sarah participated in the crimes, and was the one actually convicted of murdering Walter.The film spent a great deal of time focusing on Gordon for some reason, but that time would have been better spent on Sarah. In addition to being factual, this female villain would have provided a balance to Christine's victimization. It might also have given the film a reason to be so long.Of course, having the actual murderer in the film might interfere with the entirely fictional happy ending (the escape story, Davis's fate), and the public's mythology that only men kill children.So, it doesn't really matter to me what the quality of the rest of the film is. It's a lie masquerading as truth.",7,1,4,21 October 2009
The Young Victoria," Utterly dreadful
","I went into this film with an open mind, hoping to enjoy it as I have enjoyed other films about Royals, such as The Queen, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and Becket, among many others.However, this film is a tedious bore, and the price I paid with my boredom was abused by feeding me key moments of made-up fiction to try to punch it up. I do not take kindly to that. If you're going to make stuff up, it ought to at least be good, not try to cover for the fact that the story itself is completely boring.I could never figure out what this film wanted to be. Was it a story of a young Royal learning her position? Was it a love story? Was it a story about self-confidence? Was it about palace intrigue? Was it about republicanism and assassination attempts? Was it about someone interested in the poor, the arts, and science? Well, you got me. It seemed all of that, and therefore none.I felt absolutely nothing for the main character, nor for her supposed love interest. In fact, I was most disappointed at a certain time when it seemed the dreaded film might be over, only to discover that in fact it was going to drag on yet more. I started hating the couple, because they were delaying my exit from the cinema.As I left, I heard many complimentary things said about things like costume and makeup, but nobody said anything about the story or characters. Unfortunately, for me, I don't go to the cinema to see shiny dresses. I can see that at the better shops in the mall. I want an interesting story, and if it's about someone real, it better be damned interesting, or at least true in its important moments.Great. Now I'm in a foul mood. Thanks.",5,7,16,11 March 2010
Gravity," A good movie, but not a great one
","I guess I should be clear about which Gravity I saw. I saw the 'IMAX Experience' 3D version.(I wish the cinema had been as clear about which IMAX I would be seeing. In the rust-belt Canadian city of Windsor, IMAX apparently means 'standard movie theatre plus reclining seats and oversize goggles'. I'll try not to let my disappointment with this Cineplex 'IMAX' theatre affect my review of the film.)I'm told the film was shot in 3D, but not in IMAX. I was not wowed by the 3D in this film. It's no Avatar, and even the up-converted Titanic had superior 3D feel. If you see this at home in 2D, you will not be missing anything.I think the film is appropriately named Gravity, even though it's not really about physical gravity (until the final scene). Sometimes popular astrophysicist Tyson takes things a little literally. It's also about life and death, and the meaninglessness of life's struggle, which are pretty serious (i.e. grave) concepts.I wish more time had been spent introducing the characters. It seemed a shortcut to just start in space. I wanted to meet these people (and the others) as they were on Earth, and ride up with them. Budget cuts, I guess.But I think the film is probably the most realistic (for what it's worth) depiction of low-earth-orbit space that has been shown to large audiences in North America. Nevertheless, when I compare it with 2001: A Space Odyssey, which depicted a journey from Earth to Jupiter, with no CG effects at all, I'm left with more admiration for 2001, and a disappointment in Hollywood for making accuracy such an unexpected thing that people comment on it. But at least we have this.There are some obvious problems, most notably the locations of various space stations relative to each other and to other satellites. I figured that was BS during the film, and confirmed it by reading a Tyson tweet. Yet, I don't know how else you could have a story like this. We should note that there is no space shuttle program any more, nor is there 'Explorer', so maybe this film happens in a universe where things are a bit different.The first half of the film is about Batman trying to save Robin... I mean Ryan, after their shuttle is catastrophically hit by debris. I found the first half to be fairly average, and I blame Clooney. I just can't take him seriously any more. They should have gone with a non-Hollywood actor.The second half is about Ryan escaping ever-more-desperate situations on her trip back to Earth. The film gets significantly better in this half, so it's worth it. For atmosphere, I draw your attention to Le salaire de la peur (1953) (The Wages of Fear). These movies both patiently build a tension that have you gripping the arms of your seat.In terms of effects, I'm going to assume that almost everything that wasn't fixed in place in front of an actor was CG. That's a lot of work, and it was mostly good. But I was disappointed with the fire. The fire was good for 1999. For 2013, it was pathetic. Unless fire in space looks like poorly-animated CG fire, in which case it was spot-on. At least there wasn't a lot of it. The ending was somewhat of a let-down (see what I did there?). Here we have a person who has just been through an experience that no gods cared to help her survive, and that will render Earth orbit unusable for humanity, and she both thanks gods, and tells Matt to say hi to her dead daughter. How cheap. How predictable. If this film wanted to make a statement about religion, her capsule should have crash-landed in an Islamic republic, where should would have been sentenced to whipping for being discovered improperly covered at the beach. All the knowledge, all the heroism, all the humanity embodied by this character would be instantly irrelevant, reduced to an object at the whim of religious nuts. Now THAT would be a statement worth making, if anyone would dare.I really disliked the music. How many times do we have to suffer the cliché of crescendo orchestra followed by silence? I think I noticed three, and three more during the credits, because they are such suspense! Was the frog at the end an homage to launch-frog? I'm going to take it that way.In any case, this is certainly one of the better films of 2013, and is probably in the top three 3D films of 2013. I just wanted it to live up to the hype, and it does not.",8,5,9,8 October 2013
I'm Not There," Sound and noise, signifying nothing
","That this movie earned a spot on so many top ten lists demonstrates just how desperate people are to agree that the emperor does indeed wear clothes, when it's plainly obvious that he's nude.It is the most meaningless and time-wasting biography of a life that I can recall seeing (although I'm not eager to remember any, so they kind of fade away), and the result is a tedious mind-grinding bore for the viewer.Maybe this is due to its subject matter, but I'll never know, because the film has so failed to tell me anything worth knowing about its subject, I'm not even curious to know any more. Anything that inspired this mess is clearly to be avoided.While not as dreadful as Last Days (2005), in that it actually seems to have some vague point in there somewhere about being defined by your creations, it is no less boring and annoying. It's not good just because it's art. It's bad because it's just plain bad.So, having seen the raised middle finger offered me by director Todd Haynes, I return it right back at him. Somehow, I think that's what was intended.",5,7,8,21 February 2009
Life of Pi," A story about lying
","At the end of Life of Pi, the talented liar Pi asks the visiting Writer to choose between his two stories -- one a short brutal story of human cruelty and desperation, and the other a long romantic story of bonding with a dangerous animal. (Despite Pi's stated claims, gods actually don't play any part in the long story).Nobody proposes that the Writer (or audience) should reject both of Pi's stories, even though that's good advice.The Writer of course chooses the more detailed and uplifting romantic story. It saves him from having to come up with it himself. Presumably, this is the manner in which the Writer is convinced to 'believe in (some) god' although that's never said directly. In any case, his goal is to sell books, not to seek truth. It's not hard to guess which story is going to sell, and real life is in the process of confirming it.But the audience eventually wants the truth. We're clearly to assume that one of the stories is true (within the context of the film). Pi insists both stories are possible, suggesting we can freely choose equally. But that's not quite correct. Probabilities must be weighed. I buy the tiger story, up to a point (although perhaps I shouldn't... remember the scorpion and frog story from The Crying Game: 'it's in my nature'). But for me, probability ends at the 'carnivorous island'. It's extremely unlikely that there would be an undetectable island literally covered with fish-eating meerkats, who act indifferently to being eaten themselves, as depicted in the film. I'm more likely to believe in a mentally ill, bigoted ship's cook who takes advantage of a crisis to torture and kill. There is plenty of reason to believe that story over the other. It happens all the time on land.Somewhere between the two probabilities, it's also possible that the liar Pi survived at sea alone, and didn't just make up one bold lie, but two. But that would be a dull story, and Pi is clearly not one to tolerate boredom and dullness.The Japanese men appeared to accept the brutal story, but we're never told whether they transmitted that story to others. What of the families of the men claimed to be on the lifeboat? This story would have been an outrage, with possible legal consequences.Pi's story, because he so easily bears false witness, is unmoving, and I wasn't made into a believer by watching this film. If anything, it all fits comfortably with my unbelief. The film concludes in such a way as to demonstrate that these fanciful and sometimes pretty stories are there to hide darker ones, or more boring ones, and also to cast those who doubt them as somehow being suspect of supporting bad outcomes. We know this is how religion works, but it's nice to see it spelled out so clearly on the big screen.As for the film itself, it's quite an achievement in animation mixed with live action, and 3D cinematography. I'll have to see what The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does with high-frame rate, but Life of Pi should certainly be up for some significant awards in that area. (Yet, truly James Cameron is still the undefeated master of sinking a ship, and creating marvels that glow in the darkness.) Last, I also just saw Kumaré, which I recommend as a good double-feature with this film.",7,2,4,27 November 2012
Tangled," Lasseter's involved? Of course it's great.
","I actually didn't know anything about this film except that it was in 3D and had something to do with Rapunzel, but it had a high IMDb rating, even from old men, so I trusted you guys and I went to see it.You were right. It's an excellent film. Even if it had no story at all, it is worth seeing for the spectacular art that it is. It does have it's misfires (one small scene with water looks more like cellophane, and a spider web looks like something from a 1990s video game) but these stand out particularly because the rest of it is just so beautiful to look at. I'm fairly sure many of you will shed a tear or two, just from the beauty.Everyone will comment on the nighttime floating lantern scene, which is truly beautiful. My one concern is that with the similarity to Avatar's wood sprites, this might be becoming a cliché in 3D animated film. Of course, we could do a lot worse than to have such a good cliché.The villain in this film has a spectacular death scene. Maybe that's playing it up too much, because it's fairly simple, but the imagery is just right. I'm certain this will be remembered.The actors ... I mean the animated characters are drawn very well. But animating this close to reality is a delicate act. Some things don't work when they get too real, like exaggerated features. There are a few moments when maybe their teeth get too big and the distortion makes you a bit nauseous. Same with the eyes. You kind of wonder why they didn't just use real people. But then it falls back into place again, and it's wonderful. If you thought you might have fallen in love with one of Disney's 2D characters (come on, you know you did) wait till you see this. Flynn (why are all Disney characters recently named Flynn?) may not have the perfect body (it's a kids' show) but it's not bad, and when that face is up in yours in 3D, how can you not want to kiss it? I'm sure Rapunzel is all that too. But that's not how my boat sails.Is this the first 3D film to include a gay bar? Sure, they don't SAY the Snuggly Duckling is gay bar, but do you need them to? There are no women in it until Rapunzel shows up, and all these very butch men have these very artistic dreams. And it's the Snuggly Duckling. Good for them.Oh, and it's a musical. Or is it a movie with music? Whatever. The songs are pleasant. I enjoyed them at the time, but I can't say I remember any of them now.I saw it in 3D, but I suspect it is equally as good in 2D. For Avatar, I would say the 3D is an essential part of the film's immersive experience, whereas for Tangled, it's more of an enhancement. But they have done it right, by building it in from the start.I should say something about the story. Although based on Rapunzel, this is not the usual Rapunzel story. This version relies on magic, which if it wasn't so well done, I would normally regard as a negative. The ending is also somewhat different, but amounts to the same thing.I do suffer a twinge of guilt knowing that a quarter of a billion dollars was spent on a kids' film, instead of on, say, healthy food and education. But at least it was done well.It's a must-see film, certain to please almost anyone.",9,5,10,4 January 2011
Incendies," A slow, but good film of family secrets
","Incendies (Babelfish tells me this means Fires) is good, but a bit formulaic. It aims very high, but I think it falls short of what it could have achieved. I think it spends too much effort on atmosphere and not enough on plot. Maybe tighter editing was needed. Still, I was impressed, and it's undoubtedly one of the better Canadian films, improving on Polytechnique.Early on, there is the reading of a will, and twins are left with the tasks of locating their unknown father and brother.This takes them to ... somewhere in Palestine, which I took to be within Israel. Other reviews have noted this is supposed to be Lebanon, but looks like Jordan. I have no idea. People familiar with the history of the area seem to think that certain facts of the film mean it could not have been in any particular country in the Mid-East, because the places and dates make it impossible. But because the film never claims to be a true story (or I never saw such a claim) I'll forgive it. Still, it would have been more satisfying if it could have been set in a real place and time.From there, the film follows an almost mathematical formula, which itself is an enjoyable mini-theme of the film. One part of the math was ruined by the English subtitles. Euler's (ridiculous) quote actually was '... (a+b^n)/n=x, hence God exists ...', which I think was presented on screen as '... ©, hence God exists...'. I can't tell which version is closer to what was spoken by the character, but I doubt the word 'copyright' was used. The original quote strikes me as typical of the obfuscation and confusion used to con people into accepting various beliefs. It's nice to see that referenced in this film, particularly given what happens. It's a rare, believable, and complex representation of all-too-common religious violence.I found the film painfully slow at times. While this did serve to accentuate certain scenes which were very effective as a result, halfway through the film I wasn't sure I wanted to watch the rest of it. If I had been at home, I may have turned it off, and I would have missed a good film.I was impressed by the acting, which is to say that I didn't notice it at all. I believed the characters completely. Also, I found the use of sound helped to draw the audience into the story. The silence is silent. Noise is noisy, but in a real way, not Hollywood.I will only half-spoil the ending. For those who don't guess it, they do tell you what's coming, just before it happens. I'll hint at it here, so consider yourself warned.There is a particular question raised by one character, regarding what '1+1' equals. This can legitimately be interpreted (in electronics) as an inclusive disjunction rather than addition, giving a correct answer that is not 2. Some might see this as a trick, but I think the film is emphasizing that we should be careful about our assumptions and interpretations.",8,15,33,4 November 2010
Hugo," Quite overrated, but still good for reference nerds
","When I went to see Hugo, I was surprised to see the cinema almost empty. When I left, I was no longer surprised.Hugo is not exactly an entertaining film. Much of it is tediously boring, and too satisfied with itself and its references to old film.Part of the problem in this film is the 3D. It simply doesn't need it. In fact, I felt it pushed me out of the film. In this sense, Hugo is the anti-Avatar of 3D. Its worst moments recall Turner's colourization of black-and-white film, by 3D-ifying silent film. Ugh. Have some respect, Scorsese.And, while I was surprised to read about of all the true references the film made, the fact remains that if you don't know about these particular references beforehand, they add nothing to the film. It's like watching Scary Movie. Audiences (particularly audiences of film reviewers) are made to feel smart for getting all the references. But when it comes to plot and character, the film never knows what it wants to be about. Is it about reconnecting with a memory? Is it about making a friend? Is it about restoring a career? Is it about promoting silent film? It feels very much committee-made, devoid of heart, save for a metal one in the form of a key, another gimmick.There is a thin plot here, about an orphan boy evading forces out to catch him, and finding a new family, rejuvenating it.I love silent film. I love 3D film. I only sort of like, or tolerate, this film. But I wouldn't say it's bad -- just seriously over-hyped.So, my advice: DO NOT see it in 3D. But DO see it on cable.",7,15,29,9 December 2011
Doctor Zhivago," Good, but not great. Here's why it's not great
","This was an interesting film. It didn't lose my attention at any point, despite its lengthy running time. I won't talk much about what I liked since almost everyone likes it, so that's not interesting.My gripes, big and small are: * It feels like propaganda. Did NOTHING good EVER happen in the time period covered by this film? After a while, I actually expected zombies. We got pretty close with a hand thrust up from the ground, reports of cannibalization, and seemingly starved people walking about. Surely somebody was happy. Systems that don't make anyone happy don't last long.* At the beginning, it's never really shown why there's unrest in the first place. You don't overthrow the czar for nothing, and you want to replace it with something, but what? Sure, authorities violently suppressed a peaceful protest, but something was going on before that to get people involved. We hear words, but don't see it.* There are many characters in this film, and for some reason we're obligated to learn their first, middle, and last names. Why why WHY?! The first hour of the film is made a mystery by this nonsense. Then, later, at least one character gets an alias, but at least he's physically marked so you can identify him.* The Pasha character is inexplicable. Is he just a nut? (After 3+ hours, this should be clear, right?) * Zhivago's brother is also inexplicable. Why does he keep meddling? (After 3+ hours, this should be clear too, right?) * Actually, Zhivago and Lara are kind of hard to understand too, and this is supposed to be the heart of the story. Apparently they fell in love while working together, but we don't really feel any of that passion. Of course, we never really feel the passion with Zhivago's wife either. Where did she even come from? Was she his step-sister? This film is so long, I forget.* I wish they had spent more time on the orphaned girl. This should really have been her story, and she's the only character out of all of them that I felt anything for. I felt a bit ripped off that so much of the story during her lifetime was omitted.* Boys are not women, and they shouldn't be dubbed by women. We can find children who can read lines for today's films. What the heck was going on in the 1960s? As with many films of the time, the kids in this one just sound creepy.* Lara's theme might have been novel back then, but it's tired now, and sounds like a cheap pasta restaurant. It's really aggravating the 14th time you hear it, especially when it appears for almost no reason except to tell you 'well this scene is depressing, but think of Lara right NOW, and then back to depressing NOW'. It's so heavy-handed.In summary, I'm glad I saw it. But despite being big, it is not great.",7,0,5,31 January 2011
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," An improvement over the first, still outclassed by LOTR
","I saw this film in 3D high-frame-rate, which is I think the only way 3D should be seen. It does have a bit of that soap-opera look to it as a result, but I think that's far preferable to the choppy flip-book effect that marred other recent 3D flicks like Gravity. Why aren't other films done this way? Bad stuff first. Let's be honest, that's why were all here.Let's complain about the cinematography for a while. (1) Even in HFR, there are some scenes where motion blur is required, and it needs to be painted in if it doesn't happen naturally. For example, the scene where it is snowing, and you see the snow in front of actors' faces, would have greatly benefited from motion blur on the snow. It's very chunky snow, and snow that big shouldn't just pop into and out of existence. Similarly, some of the rapid fight scenes should also have been blurred. The vast majority of motion in the film is luxuriously smooth, and it's jarring to see the strobe effect when things start getting fast. (2) The cinematographers & directors just don't understand how a 3D film should feel to an audience. Quick cuts, hand-held cameras (or equivalent CG effects), and crazy swooping camera positions DO NOT MAKE SENSE in 3D, and make even less sense with HFR. It's almost nauseating. (Almost). With this level of realism, you need to return to stage ideas. Take a cue from Les Misérables (the stage musical). The stage can move, but there better be a reason for it. It needs to make sense. This team may be filming in 3D, but they're directing for 2D. Stop it. Stop it! (3) Some of the close-ups looked perfectly flat, or worse yet, projected onto a tilted flat surface. I have no idea what to say about that, except that I'm glad I only noticed it twice. It's almost like it wasn't finished.My other major gripe about this film is the writing and acting (and directing), which SHOULD combine to produce characters you care about, because you understand them and their lives. I know the source material for The Hobbit doesn't really lend itself to that. I don't care. It's not my problem. They should have made it work, but instead they clearly said 'f--- it'. There are a grand total of zero interesting characters in this film, including the two title characters, although they are slightly closer to being interesting than the rest. Ultimately most are merely cogs fit into a machine that produces a defeated dragon in the upcoming 3rd film. We all know what's going to happen. We want to feel it. Where is the feeling?And the credits, which I sat through, just sucked. Bad. Really, Peter?But.The good stuff.This film is not just a middle film, and it does deliver the goods you were looking for. Fortunately, The Hobbit's 'middle film' was got over with first (Sorry, Gollum). This is really the first film that matters in The Hobbit trilogy. You don't even need to see the first one to understand it.Some of the images on screen were really, really beautiful. They remind you what the artists of cinema can do (like in Avatar). One of many shots that I found remarkable was just after Legolas leaves his home to search for Tauriel, and finds her. It's just an amazing image of the two of them there in the landscape (and to be clear, I am speaking of the landscape, not them).Once again, cinema has crowned a new dragon. It happens every once in a while, and we've come such a long way since Dragonslayer (1981). If you do not actually feel the heat on your face from this one, you're not breathing. I'm going to miss him when he's gone. I know he's 'the bad guy' but honestly almost nobody has good motives in this film anyway (and I think that's the point of the story). He just wanted to sleep with his (admittedly stolen) trinkets and now people have come to kill him.As thrilling as it is when it happens, I am surprised that we see Sauron in this film. True, we sort of saw Sauron in LOTR prior to his ring-finger getting lopped off, but we never really saw Sauron in all his fiery glory. This time we do, in a stunning battle with Gandalf the Grey. I'm not sure what to think of it, but it was spectacular to see. Also somewhat interesting is the not-subtle suggestion that Smaug and Sauron are more than simply on the same team, evidenced by their near-identical eyes, and use of the same voice actor.And the first song during the end credits was very good. I wish I could have heard it over the bustle of people heading for the exit... (Peter, this is why you need to make credits INTERESTING again).In summary, I am very glad I saw this film, but it should have been better. I am expecting better from the final film in the trilogy. And I hate that you're making me wait a year to see it.",8,4,9,17 December 2013
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," No, the CGI was NOT good
","I might have given this film a 7/10 for being not half bad, provided that there were no werewolves or vampires in it. Whoever is in charge of this stuff needs to understand that you only do the effects that you CAN do.I burst out laughing the first time the werewolves were on the screen, and again when we were actually shown the transition from stud-boy to cartoon-wolf. I don't think that was supposed to be the effect, but it did liven up the film a bit.Even simple effects like Bella's hallucinations of Edward were pretty bad. It's like they didn't even try... just overlaying some stupid Photoshop effect directly onto the rest of the video, instead of blending it in.Don't even get me started on Edward's fight with the Volturi. We go from The Matrix to THIS? Oh the shame of it.Aside from the CGI, the film is an hour too long, and vampires STILL do not sparkle. But if they did, it would look better than that.",6,0,5,2 August 2010
The Blind Side," Dreadfully slow propaganda
","Some have described this as a sports film. It's not. Only the last half of the film has any sport in it, and it's really not about that. Overall the film is about a family helping another child. The sport could have been anything, and was irrelevant to the film.I found the pace of the film to be dreadfully slow. Probably 30 minutes could have been cut from it, without losing anything. Part of the problem can't be solved by editing. The leaden acting, from everyone including the two leads, and boring directing even make necessary scenes drag on and on. The writing is that of an after-school special or TV movie of the week.The film is also presented as a true story. But key parts of the film are fabrications.The presentation of how Oher learned football is false. Oher did not need to be taught football by his mom or brother. He was an aggressive player. Still, he did not throw an opposing player over a fence. The film was not improved by these fabrications, so you have to wonder why they are in the film.The film notably omits the facts that Oher didn't raise his GPA through normal means, but instead took 10-day internet courses from BYU. All that each course required students to do was to read a few brief passages from famous works or speeches and then answer five questions. These courses provided the A's to replace his F's in English. I know this makes people seem less angelic and heroic, but this is what was reported elsewhere, and should have been in the film. Complex characters and stories make film interesting.Regarding the airbag scene, I believe the film depicts it as the family does in real life, however it simply isn't credible. Sure, it's a nice explanation to make everyone feel better about what happened, but come on. Most likely Oher was instinctively bracing for impact, or to try to restrain SJ from hitting the dashboard from the impact he saw coming, and his arm happened to be where the airbag later deployed. If you see any video (slowed-down or not) of an airbag deployment, you know how ludicrous the claim is that Oher (a) knew it might deploy on this low speed impact, (b) knew airbag deployment would be dangerous for someone of SJ's size, (c) had time to decide to stop it rather than stopping the vehicle, and (d) was able to move in any way in time to deflect the airbag's deployment. Those bags are only inflated for a fraction of a second, and then deflate to provide cushioning, so hitting it even slightly before or after deployment is just pushing air around. I think hitting an airbag may increase or decrease the pressure in the bag at the time the protected person's face hits it, resulting in more injury to the person. It would be interesting to get Mythbusters' take on it.Now let's talk bias. Once again, we have a movie where a white family saves a black child. This story has been told to death. There are other families in the US, and their stories need to be told, for once. But if we insist on these stories, can't we at least tell them from the child's point of view? Instead, they make this one about about Leigh Anne. The story by itself is not racist, but when you consider the context of Hollywood film over the years, things start to look pretty bad.Last, the propaganda angle. This is quite overtly a Christian propaganda film, as opposed to a film with Christian characters. I found the repeated use of the phrase 'good Christian' to be particularly offensive because it's designed to suggest that being good equals or requires being Christian, or that there is something somehow uniquely Christian about the behaviour shown. These are people who have done a good thing. Maybe they even had ulterior motives, but they did it. That's good enough without the propaganda. Similarly, the repeated focus on the phrase 'with men this is possible, but with god all things are possible'. This is a mis-quote of the actual phrase from Matthew 19:26 'With man this is impossible ...'. It's just more propaganda, not to mention provably false. Humans deserve credit for what we do, even when we do the right thing. Last, the film ends with Leigh Anne thanking her god that some other kid died instead of hers. It's a line clearly meant to inspire, but when you think about it, is actually pretty revolting. A god that permits these deaths is not deserving of thanks.I do give filmmakers credit for correctly quoting the oft-mis-quoted line from Charge of the Light Brigade ('do and die').",5,11,19,18 October 2010
Toy Story 3," Pixar's worst
","Wow. I was really disappointed, and I'm shocked that the fanboys having pumped this film up to #6 on IMDb at this time. That's sheer lunacy.I loved Toy Story & Toy Story 2 (which I saw again last year). The focus in those two films actually WAS on the story, and Pixar is noted for putting the story first, ahead of the animation.But this time around, they REALLY missed the mark. Halfway through, I was wondering if I was watching Toy Story 2 all over again. It was all so very repetitive and boring.Last, one of the notable new characters, Ken, is a closet case and it's strongly hinted at more and more as the film progresses, but Ken is never allowed to grow beyond that denial, and Barbie falls victim to his lies. How is that appropriate for a kids' film? The character should be who he is proudly, not closety. This is what we tell our kids, so why wouldn't it be the same for toys? (Focus groups, probably)Of all the Pixar films, this one has the least story, the least heart, and the least fun.This is not to say it doesn't have some wonderful moments. A bad Pixar film is still better than most other things out there. But this is a new low for them.",7,4,14,30 June 2010
