Men in Black 3," Something to learn here
","I really enjoyed this movie. Many films which move between time zones can get very confusing. These time jumps were clear and well directed. I loved the character of Griffin. I study a lot about the new World Shift in Consciousness that the Mayan Calendar brought a lot of media attention to. It won't all happen on December 21, 2012 necessarily. It's a big process and has already started. We may not see the most dramatic changes until early 2013 but they are inevitable and they will be mind-blowing in a good way.What I've learnt about moving from a 3D perspective to a 5D perspective is exactly what Griffin's character has correct. It's about seeing all possibilities and probabilities as well as all circumstances that brought you to where you are now on any given topic. From there you can calculate what scenario is most likely but you can also bend fate in the direction of the ending you'd prefer. Pretty cool.",8,0,2,30 October 2012
