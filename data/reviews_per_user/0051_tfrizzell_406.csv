The Rock," An Action Film That Shares the Spotlight With the Actors
","'The Rock' is an adrenaline rush of a movie that was one of the big hits of 1996.  The actual film deals with a crazed Marine (Ed Harris) who has taken over Alcatraz and holds 181 people hostage in order to get $100 million to benefit fallen comrades from U.S. wars.  If he does not receive the money, he will launch chemical warheads on San Francisco and likely kill thousands. Enter FBI scientist Nicolas Cage and former inmate Sean Connery who are sent to the island along with Michael Biehn and a special missions corps to save the day.  The film is not short on action, in fact you will find yourself trying to catch your breath during several moments.  However, the characters are all three-dimensional and interesting.  The three primary characters (Cage, Connery, and Harris) in  particular are all well-developed.  All in all this is a good film to fill time in one's day, but it is not for those with a weak heart.  4 out of 5 stars.",Null,4,5,25 July 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Babes in the Woods.
","Highly disturbing shoe-string flick that has three college film students going out in the woods of nearby Burkittesville, Maryland to find an entity only known as the Blair Witch. The three individuals do not take the mumbo-jumbo seriously at first, but as they film their journey the tension builds to a fevered pitch. Strange occurrences and loud nights cause the three to slowly go crazy and their safety becomes a major concern as the clock ticks. Could the myth really be a reality? 'The Blair Witch Project' is one of those films that will be copied and copied by hacks for years to come. This will all cause many to forget how creative and truly original this film is. The documentary style and the clever advertising campaign led many to believe that this was in fact reality. The craze was on par with that of 'The Exorcist' for a short time in 1999. Followed by an interesting but somewhat disappointing sequel, 'The Blair Witch Project' makes a real case for best horror film of the 1990s and one of the finest productions ever for the usually trivial genre. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,6,28 November 2002
The Mask," Films Like This Cannot Mask Obvious Problems From Me.
","Cartoon-styled live action mess has goof-ball banker Jim Carrey becoming the owner of an exotic tribal mask. The mask is that of a Norse god of mischief and soon Carrey becomes a wild and crazed character when he turns into his alter ego. Soon he upsets crime syndicate Peter Greene and has to dodge pesky police detective Peter Riegert (who had a substantial role in 'Traffic'). The movie only really comes alive and gets off its sugar rush when the shady Cameron Diaz (in her introductory role) comes on the screen. Diaz' beauty and hot performance is the only real attraction in this moronic outing. A silly, disgusting and stupid movie that could induce nausea and migraine headaches. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,2,7,10 October 2003
Saturday Night Fever," Living Vicariously Through the Weekends.
","An uneducated Brooklyn teen (John Travolta, in an Oscar-nominated role) lives in a dream world over the weekends as the king of a disco dance floor. Disillusioned, quietly upset with where his life is, Travolta finds solace by dancing in public to Bee Gee's music and finds love with his newest dance partner (Karen Lynn Gorney). The duo practice for an upcoming contest that could mean total success at last for Travolta and the opportunity to get discovered doing what he really loves. Travolta and his friends seem destined to go down a path of destruction though as a soap opera develops for all the key people found within. 'Saturday Night Fever' is a total over-achiever as it could have fallen to exploitation tactics of the 1970s, but becomes one of those iconic films that still stands the test of time. Travolta is a revelation in arguably his greatest role. The other players are adequate and the screenplay is deceptively smarter than it appears on the surface. The movie also works as a time capsule to a part of contemporary American history where discos and bell-bottoms were all the rage. Still one of the finer films of the time period. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,43,50,23 June 2004
The Benchwarmers," Burn That Bench.
","A trio of lifetime losers (Rob Schneider, Jon Heder and David Spade) are funded by a mega-billionaire (Jon Lovitz) to compete in a tournament against little league baseball teams across the state of California. Nerds, geeks and Trekkies everywhere unite! Typical underdog dribble that starts off fair enough with silly gags and a likable cast of misfits, but then wears thin pretty quick with more and more ridiculous situations, disgusting jokes, innuendos aplenty and even a super-creepy robotic butler (no kidding). Cameos all over the place by sports people (Reggie Jackson, Sean Salisbury, Bill Romanowski, Dan Patrick and Craig Kilborn) are just as unwanted and out-of-place as this entire awful production. A real stinker that has a short running time going for it, but little else. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,2 May 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More Ninja Stars Than Swords.
","Disappointing finale to director Quentin Tarantino's ode to modern Hollywood epics as a once believed-dead assassin (Uma Thurman) continues her reign of revenge against former partners who double-crossed her on her El Paso wedding day. Thurman still must overcome professional killers Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah in order to reach the mysterious titled character (David Carradine). Flashbacks galore, side-stories, black and white sequences and more background into the series' key narrative points all mix to make a fascinating and yet somewhat meandering final product. 'Kill Bill: Vol.1' worked due to chaos, action and crazed cinematic techniques. This sequel seems strangely tame and Tarantino's attempt at focusing on heart rather than reaction falls somewhat flat. Carradine, who was never seen but always horrifying in the original, becomes a strange sort of sadistic-type clown who comes off more funny than menacing. Just lacks the adrenaline and Tarantino's patented killer style that the first had. Still far from a waste, but just does not have the famed director's legendary intensity. Watch for Samuel L. Jackson in a bit part. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,24 September 2005
Vertigo," Get Lost in It.
","Along with 'Psycho', Hitchcock's best film that wraps itself around the viewer very fast and never does let go. San Francisco detective Jimmy Stewart is slowly going crazy due to a failed mission which did not work because of his intense fear of heights. This is all front-page news of course and Stewart is shamed about the whole event. But a ray of light shines as he gets a job to watch a man's wife (Kim Novak) who is supposedly having an affair with another man. Stewart believes this is his chance to put the past behind him, but sometimes the future is even darker. Stewart falls in love with Novak and the love turns into a dark and twisted obsession that becomes deeper and deeper as the film progresses. When tragedy strikes, that is the end. Right? Not quite. An amazing screenplay and arguably Hitchcock's greatest directing venture make the film solid and Stewart's stunning performance raises the whole project to a classic level. Somewhat ignored around the awards circuit in 1958, but ages beautifully as the years go by. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,94,164,6 July 2002
The New World," Discovering More of the Globe.
","John Smith (Colin Farrell) lands in the titled location of present-day North America in the late-17th century. Strains come from the natives immediately (led by chieftain August Schellenberg and warrior Wes Studi) as their balance of nature and peaceful surroundings is threatened. Pocahontas (a smashingly amazing starring debut by youngster Q'Orianka Kilcher) ends up being the liaison between her people and the British newcomers. A deep ethereal love blossoms between Farrell and Kilcher, but time and circumstance will not allow it to be. The focus shifts as more newcomers come and a young John Rolfe (dynamite role for Christian Bale) falls for the hypnotic Kilcher and marriage follows. Kilcher does not only win over the British in her land, but in theirs as well as historical fascinations bring her over as both a curiosity and also an early diplomat for connections between old time lands and new ones. Carrying a heavy burden not only historically but also cinematically, Kilcher's role becomes the thing legends are made of. 'The New World' is simply out of this world all the way. The eclectic and highly enigmatic Terrence Malick (writer/director) appeared lost forever to the cinematic world after his triumphant 'Days of Heaven' in 1978. He popped up again 20 years later with 'The Thin Red Line' (the very best film of the 1990s). The rumor mill made it appear that he may not be heard from again. Thankfully he was some seven years later in 2005. Malick's production is everything you would expect from arguably the finest American filmmaker alive (the most interesting and fascinating anyway). Poetic undertones and the deep philosophical questioning of life and our place in this world mix with top-notch cinematography, a hauntingly beautiful score and wonderful set pieces. Farrell, made out to be the top-billed star, disappears about half-way through and the focus shifts to Bale and Kilcher. The three are on cinematic highs rarely reached and the supporting performers (most notably Christopher Plummer, Jonathan Pryce and Alexandra W.B. Malick in basically cameo roles) are well-placed players in Malick's operatic ode to this sometimes unbelievably beautiful and complex part of early North American/world history. Way too smart for most audiences and much too methodical and strategic for shallow cinematic viewers, 'The New World' proudly sits next to Malick's other three masterpieces as one of the very best pictures ever conceived. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,9,16,6 May 2006
Walk the Line," Here Comes the Man in Black.
","The life of Johnny Cash (dynamite performance from Joaquin Phoenix) is told from humble beginnings in the Arkansas cotton fields to musical success and a terrible addiction to liquor and prescription medication. Tragedy strikes early on as a young Cash (Ridge Canipe) must deal with the death of his older brother (Lucas Till) and a standoffish relationship with a stern father (Robert Patrick in an appropriately rough part). Adulthood brings military service, marriage (to sweetheart Ginnifer Goodwin) and finally a chance at the brass ring (not to mention a relationship with fellow singer June Carter played to the hilt by Reese Witherspoon). 'Walk the Line' is no doubt inspired by the amazing success that 'Ray' produced last year. Phoenix and Witherspoon get in a fevered rhythm of performing excellence as co-writer/director James Mangold keeps the drum beating with his quick pace and lightning fast flash-points. Although a bit long and sometimes too loud, 'Walk the Line' still proves that a cinematic biography done correctly can lead to beautiful music for all to see and hear. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,10,29 December 2005
Alien 3," 'Alien' + 'Aliens' = A Disjointed Mess
","'Alien 3' combines the major elements of the first two entries in the popular series to make a disjointed mess that feels forced and rushed.  This time Sigourney Weaver crash-lands her space ship from the last installment on a planet of jailed murderers and rapists.  Everyone else on the ship dies and she believes that the alien has hitched a ride with her to this new planet.  Of course it has and soon she, and everyone else on the planet, is trying to kill the alien and save themselves.  'Alien 3' has the eerie feel of the first film and the in-your-face action of the second.  These two elements make the film  disjointed.  At some points the audience is bored stiff and at other moments they are confused by the outlandish action sequences.  The direction is never clear and there is no real screenplay here at all.  Weaver tries to carry the film by herself, but she lacks the support that she had for the first two entries.  Lance Henriksen only makes a token appearance.  Charles Dutton is pretty good, but his character lacks the development to really make him interesting.  Everyone else is just present and ultimately the alien proves to be little more than a jack-in-the-box monster that hops out at the most predictable moments. Overall a disappointment that is not very impressive at all.  2 stars out of 5.",Null,503,548,26 October 2000
Gremlins," Enjoyable 1980s Non-Sense
","'Gremlins' is one of those guilty pleasures.  It is not a very good film, but there is just something about this film that makes it watchable and enjoyable.  Young Zach Galligan gets a pet for Christmas, but everything goes terribly wrong when the pet gets wet.  Now there are several of these cute creatures, but the new ones are evil and after eating a bucket of chicken after midnight, they become the title 'Gremlins'.  Chaos follows and the small mid-western town is torn apart piece by piece.  The film is fun, but pretty short on direction, screenplay, and characterization.  All in all, a film that over-achieves for the most-part.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,4,19 September 2000
Antz," Great Computer Animation But Not a Very Good Film
","'Antz' is a somewhat disappointing film that tries real hard, but never does quite succeed.  We get a glimpse into the lives of ants and their daily lives.  The voice characterizations are interesting, but the story-line never does come together the way it was intended to.  Overall a fair film that is too complicated for children and too dull for adults.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,3,3 August 2000
Miracle," Ice Rinks of Dreams.
","Pure popcorn film that uses a proven formula to get its cliches and story across. Admittedly though the formula here is good enough to make 'Miracle' a minor success. New U.S. Olympic ice hockey coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) takes a band of rag-tag young men from various places and try to mold them together to defeat the dead-eyed Soviet Union national team which had captured gold medals at each winter game competition from 1964 through 1976 (every four years of that period). The U.S. Olympic Committee just wants to be competitive, but Russell goes beyond that philosophy---he wants to win it all. And thus we have a 'Hoosiers'/'Remember the Titans' hybrid with a splash of 'Rocky' and 'Chariots of Fire' mixed in. The result is a good, but far from great little film that could best be described as 'The Rookie''s and 'Field of Dreams'' (two films that are very over-rated in my mind) little brother. Russell is the only notable performer here. Patricia Clarkson is the closest thing to being the second fiddle as Russell's wife. The hockey players are all flat characters that end up being Midwestern and Northeastern stereotypes. The Russians are more mysterious than interesting and those in the Olympic Committee are just present in the venture. Russell's domineering command of the screen and a very memorable musical score make up for most of the picture's shortcomings. Runs a bit long, but still a good way to spend some time with friends and family and remember a truly amazing part of American and sports history. Sadly the real Herb Brooks died in an automobile accident during the early stages of this production's filming. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,2 March 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Cruise Control.
","An IMF agent kidnapped, a helicopter chase through windmills, a weapon of mass world destruction that cannot even be comprehended, hot new cars exploding, bridges blowing up, complex architectural geometry---metric system style, a Hannibal Lecter-styled restraining mask and of course that lit fuse that has always been the trademark of this television series/cinematic idea. Life is good for Tom Cruise in Virginia. His IMF days are relatively calm as he trains specialists while posing as an ordinary guy with new fiancé Michelle Monaghan. However, things are about to shatter in striking fashion as a crazed international arms dealer (recent Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) is after an elusive device deemed as an anti-god weapon only known as the 'rabbit's foot'. Thus it is up to Cruise and his new team (franchise alum Ving Rhames and newcomers Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to attempt the difficult and accomplish the impossible. IMF leaders Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup round out the high adrenaline mix. From Berlin to the Vatican to Shanghai, 'Mission: Impossible 3' takes out all the stops and winds itself up into a heated frenzy from its shocking opening sequence all the way to its dramatic, action-packed conclusion. Making the audience forget the disaster that was 'Mission: Impossible 2', first-time director J.J. Abrams (best known for ABC's breakout television hits 'Alias' and 'Lost') gets back to what made the original in 1996 so great and interesting---liquid mercury flow and pace. Cruise is near the top of his game and Hoffman is a legitimate scene-stealer in every sense of the term (even though his screen time is somewhat minuscule when you stop to think about it). The premise did not end up being Jerry Maguire vs. Truman Capote though as the duo gets into a crazed match of wits and verbal exchanges that culminates into sparks that are just as well thought-out and executed as the most intense of action motifs. As summer blockbusters and entertainment vehicles go, you can't do much better at the movie house than this winner. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,31,64,6 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Stinging.
","A case of mistaken identity throws seemingly ordinary man Josh Hartnett between two ruthless New York City crime bosses (the always priceless Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). Now he has to dodge police detective Stanley Tucci and shady hit-man Bruce Willis while starting a hot love affair with the super-sexy Lucy Liu. But in a picture like this you know that nothing is quite as it seems as a dizzying final act turns the very foundation of the entire production on its ear and gives the audience a wickedly twisted conclusion that will make earlier trivial situations come to the forefront. Amazingly slick and well-crafted mind-bender that toes the line of obscurity throughout its early parts and then finally finds its way late and becomes a nice little success. Hartnett continues to impress when given the right material (like he had in 'Black Hawk Down') and the other mainstays are generally constant guarantees. Patience and attention to small details will help you greatly in this flawed, but highly ambitious teaser that finds its legs and runs strong as it progresses. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,8,17,10 June 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Good Heavens!!!
","A punch-in-the-stomach, kick-in-the-rear, slap-in-the-face of a movie that is as heart-breaking and difficult to watch as a Super Bowl involving the Buffalo Bills. 'Requiem for a Dream', along with 'Traffic', was bar-none the best film of 2000. Both deal with the hidden drug war this country faces. 'Traffic' is an epic that has a wide scope while 'Requiem for a Dream' has a very exact focus. Coney Island is hanging on by a thread and so are four of its inhabitants. There is elderly widow Ellen Burstyn (in an almost unrecognizable role that is her finest performance which garnered her an Oscar-nomination), her young-adult son (Jared Leto), his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans). Burstyn gets a call one day explaining that she has been chosen to be on her favorite game show (hosted by the priceless Christopher McDonald). Burstyn is lonely and wants to go on television in her old red dress (which she cannot fit into anymore). She learns from a friend that a shady doctor will give her diet pills to help her burn off those pesky extra pounds. Meanwhile Leto, Connelly and Wayans are addicted to cocaine and heroin. They support the amazingly quick high they get from the drugs by pushing nickel and dime bags all over the city. However they get a bit more ambitious. They decide to buy in bulk in order to get more money in order to get high more often. The three want the simplest things in life. Leto wants a life with Connelly, Connelly wants to open a store that sells designer clothes and Wayans wants a woman to provide the love and compassion that his late mother gave him. It appears for awhile that the dreams may indeed come true, but drugs are not the answer and the trio soon learns this in a vividly disturbing way. Burstyn, addicted to supposedly legal drugs, will head down a path of destruction just like the three young people. Darren Aronofsky's (of 'Pi' fame) haunting film is the wildest cinematic experience I have ever had. The film makes 'The Exorcist' look like 'Sesame Street' gone stark-raving mad. The revolutionary camera techniques and wild sequences make the film feel like the most death-defying ride at any amusement park. Hubert Selby, Jr.'s intense novel comes to frightening life (he also has a small role as a wise-cracking guard at a jail) due to a really smart screenplay, tight direction and revolutionary performances by the four key players. Burstyn goes beyond the best work she did in great films of the 1970s (most notably 'The Last Picture Show', 'The Exorcist', 'Harry and Tonto' and 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'). Wayans proves to be a really solid performer after being in silly productions that had little merit. Leto also proves to be an actor that can do much more than just stand in front of the camera. Connelly's performance (a role that is hard as nails to play) just continued to show what a versatile and risk-taking actress she is. She should have been Oscar-nominated here at the very least, but the Academy did make up for their mishap with her Oscar for 'A Beautiful Mind'. Not a joy to watch, but an immensely important film that should be experienced at least once by all individuals who are of a mature age. Rated NC-17 (that is warranted), 'Requiem for a Dream' is a sledge-hammer of a film that will leave you visibly shaken long after you first see it. It could best be described as a guided tour of Hell on Earth. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,3,6,6 August 2002
The Sound of Music," Hollywood's Last Great Musical
","'The Sound of Music' is an impressive musical that stands above other films of the genre because of interesting characters, top-notch direction, and a truly inspired screenplay.  Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married.  However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria.  Somewhat based on a true story, 'The Sound of Music' is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act.  This makes the film believable and none of the musical numbers take away from the story or the film's direction.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,75,125,28 October 2000
Ali," Important Film-Making and the Most Underrated Film of 2001.
","'Ali' is the much-awaited film dealing with American icon Muhammad Ali (Oscar-nominee Will Smith in the performance of a lifetime). The film follows Ali from 1964, when he defeated Sonny Liston (Michael Bentt) for the heavyweight crown, to the famous 'Rumble in the Jungle' in 1974 when he reclaimed the title from George Foreman (Charles Shufford). Between the time however, Ali went through a decade of chaos as the nation did the same. He changed his name from Cassius Clay and adopted Muhammad Ali and made his devotion to the Nation of Islam public. Many looked at Ali as a threat while others thought he was a refreshing change, a man with the flair and personality of all four members of 'The Beatles'. Ali's religious beliefs would cause trouble however for himself as he would turn his back on Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and refuse to go to Vietnam and become known as a draft-dodger to many. Through it all Ali would be himself and not compromise his beliefs or moral makeup. His relationships with Howard Cossell (Jon Voight in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated turn) and his trainers Drew Brown (Jamie Foxx), Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) and Ferdie Pacheco (Paul Rodriguez) would prove to be lasting friendships that would help Ali make his comeback against Foreman in 1974. Nemesis and friend Joe Frazier (James Toney) also proved to be an important figure in getting Ali back in the ring. The film also shows Ali as a womanizer. His relationships with Sonji Clay (Smith's real-life wife Jada Pinkett-Smith), Belinda Ali (Nona Gaye) and Veronica Porche (Michael Michele) are all given amounts of screen-time. As the 'Rumble in the Jungle' approaches we also get a glimpse of Ali with a young Don King (Mykelti Williamson in yet another stunning transformation). 'Ali' is an honest film that tells a story and does not pull any punches. The film does not show Ali as a superhero or as a larger-than-life figure. It shows him as a man, a man with thoughts, beliefs, feelings, intelligence, short-comings, likes, dislikes and a man full of personality. The real Muhammad Ali appeared on Oprah Winfrey shortly before the film opened to the public and stated that he wanted the film to explain to people who he really is. That is the reason I give this film a perfect score. It serves its purpose to the paramount. It is well-made by Michael Mann and its attention to small details are uncanny. 'Ali' is what the cinema is meant to be. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,4,15 April 2002
The Longest Yard," 36 Inches of Pain.
","Entertaining, but somewhat dumb remake of the minimally successful original of 1974. Ex-pro quarterback Adam Sandler is put into a rough Texas prison after a crazed night of driving drunk and breaking his probation restrictions. Inside he meets a wide range of characters (old Heisman Trophy winner Burt Reynolds, wise-crack Chris Rock and thugs Michael Irvin and Nelly) and tries to turn the rag-tag group of cons into a team in a month's time to play a football game against sadistic warden James Cromwell's prison guards (led by ex-pro players Brian Bosworth and Bill Romanowski). The whole set-up is little more than window dressing to get to the film's final act and the big game. This movie's predecessor had a hard edge to it that made it somewhat believable in spite of the ridiculous material. The characters here are not developed well enough and the Sandler/Cromwell combo is just not up to the Reynolds/Eddie Albert duo of the original. The comedy borders on being downright offensive here, but really nothing should be taken too seriously. Not terrible, but honestly not very good either. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,3,31 May 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg Gets Back to the Basics.
","Steven Spielberg got up from a short slump ('A.I.--Artificial Intelligence' and 'Minority Report', which were both minor disappointments) with this enjoyable little film that is a lot darker and more dramatic than it appears on the surface. Teenager Leonardo DiCaprio is going through a crossroads in life as his parents (Oscar-nominee Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) are about to divorce. Baye wants a divorce to marry James Brolin (who DiCaprio does not care for at all) and it seems that the youth must decide himself who he wishes to live with. DiCaprio instead decides to run off and quickly gets an idea to be a con-artist. Thus he has a long run throughout the majority of the 1960s as he cons his way towards $2.5 million over 26 countries. He poses as a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer as the years pass by. He falls in love with the naive Amy Adams, has a run-in with her hard father (Martin Sheen) and continues to elude the pesky agent on his tail (another brilliant turn for Tom Hanks). Through it all, DiCaprio continues to keep tabs on Walken (who dramatically changes economically and personally as the film progresses) and grows to respect and like Hanks and the challenge he poses. 'Catch Me If You Can' is another film about the strong bond between fathers and sons, much like the superior 'Road to Perdition'. Spielberg's solid direction and an interesting screenplay just adds to the performances of DiCaprio and Hanks. However, it is Walken who steals every scene and adds the heart the film desperately needed. Although his screen-time is not overwhelming, he dominates when in action (not an easy thing to do over the two superstars). Overall I did like the film very much, but the tone and pacing is imperfect. Still a very successful venture in the end. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,4,7,25 March 2003
The Hangover," Overstays Its Welcome, Hang Around at Your Own Risk.
","About-to-be-wed Justin Bartha is accompanied by his three friends (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis) to Las Vegas for one last breath of bachelor freedom. All hell breaks loose though after the first night as Bartha is nowhere to be found and the trio of pals have absolutely no recollection of anything that transpired. Would-be comedic dynamo which starts off like a champion and then fades into obscurity like a washed-up bench-warmer. The typical 'Old School' and 'Wedding Crashers'-styled comedy wears out its welcome as the zany situations (a missing tooth, an abandoned baby, a loose tiger, a stolen police car, the yakuza, and so on) come at you fast and furiously with adult situations and sometimes downright vulgar outcomes being the orders for the day. Lost in the mix is Bartha (just basically getting lost in the shuffle early on) and usually dependable performers like Heather Graham and Jeffrey Tambor who have little more than token parts. Cameos by Mike Tyson and Mike Epps are unnecessary distractions and the inclusion of sexually-confused Asian crime boss Ken Jeong (seeing more of him than we want) are dizzying sidelines which represent little rime, reason, and most importantly merit. Good for a few laughs, but at an over-priced expense. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,5,11,1 July 2009
Ghost," Getting the Red Carpet Treatment.
","'Ghost' is a good film, but did it deserve a Best Picture nomination in 1990? Well, I would lean towards the answer no. The Oscar-winning original screenplay deals with a man (Patrick Swayze) who has been brutally murdered and is now an earthly spirit trying to protect his lover (Demi Moore) from those who ended his life. Along for the ride is a wise-cracking would-be psychic (Oscar-winner Whoopi Goldberg) who acts as the medium between Swayze and Moore. The film was a box office smash and was a slight triumph with the critics. 'Ghost' just never really quite did it for me though. Harsh issues throughout are then overshadowed by scenes of humor and romance. The tone is somewhat uneven and the supernatural aspect is overplayed. Still a good picture, but somewhat over-rated. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,2,5,24 March 2004
The Ring," Wraps Itself Around You.
","Atmospheric and definitely disturbing modern horror film that sticks with you like crazy glue during its running time and beyond. Teenager Amber Tamblyn dies mysteriously one night at home and it appears that the youngster was literally scared to death. Aunt and Seattle news reporter Naomi Watts quickly learns that her niece had supposedly viewed a strange video tape a week earlier. Tamblyn's three friends had also watched the tape with her and died under odd circumstances. Watts' investigative skills lead to the discovery of the video, but she makes a huge mistake by viewing its contents. Now it seems that Watts is the target of the curse and she must race against the clock to find out how she can overcome the evil powers. Former lover Martin Henderson and young son David Dorfman also fall into the trap of viewing the film and their lives become jeopardized as well. Together Watts and Henderson embark on a journey together to save their lives and save the life of their young son. Naturally mystery lies in every direction as the contents of the film are slowly presented in real life, but what symbolism do the striking images possess? 'The Ring' is one of those odd films that really leaves more questions than answers. It is a disturbing film that has some dark imagery that will stick with you long after viewing it. The PG-13 rating is very misleading as this should have been an R hands down. The movie wants to be a darker version of 'The Sixth Sense' and somewhat succeeds in that regard. However, 'The Ring''s tone makes it a film that bears sharp comparison to films like 'Night of the Living Dead' (the 1968 version) and 'Rosemary's Baby' in the fact that it relies more on confusion than clarity. The direction is solid, the screenplay is all over the map and Naomi Watts steals the show as she did in the equally confusing 'Mulholland Dr.'. While 'The Ring' does not match the brilliance of Lynch's 'Mulholland Dr.', it is still a striking work that ends up being a success by the last intense act. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,6,10,26 November 2002

Spartacus," Kubrick's Take on the Hollywood Epic.
","Excellent and sprawling epic drama that is one of the most under-rated films ever produced. The titled slave (Kirk Douglas) leads a revolt against the evil Roman Empire, trying to win freedom for himself and all those like him. Laurence Olivier gives a show-stopping performance as Douglas' mortal enemy. Charles Laughton, Tony Curtis and Jane Russell also add great supporting turns. Peter Ustinov took home Oscar gold as he steals every scene as a self-absorbed slave trader who eventually has a change of heart.

United 93," United We Stand.
","Four planes were hijacked on 9/11. Two hit the World Trade Center in New York. Another struck the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. 'United 93' is a heart-pounding, difficult, tight, taut and chaotic account of the fourth hijacked plane which was headed to the U.S. Capitol building, but crashed instead in an open Pennsylvania field as 40 seemingly ordinary people with nothing in common except a doomed flight banded together and sacrificed themselves to save other innocents. Brutally rough film that is to 9/11 what 'Battleground', 'The Sands of Iwo Jima' and '12 O'Clock High' were to World War II combat in 1949 and what 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Coming Home' were to Vietnam when released in 1978. Writer/director Paul Greengrass (a British film-maker who is best known for the 'Bourne' series sequels) goes basically real-time here as he focuses on the disorganization and total shock of that fateful day five years ago. Trish Gates, as one of the flight attendants, Cheyenne Jackson, David Alan Basche and Christian Clemenson are all standouts, but the real stars of 'United 93' are the camera and the hypnotic dramatic score. Memorable, unforgettable and destined to be an important addition to the cinema, 'United 93' is a strong production all the way. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,10,22,28 April 2006
Deja Vu," It Is Bad.........It Is Bad..........It Is Bad...........Dare I Say Deja Vu?
","A New Orleans ATF agent (Denzel Washington) tries to literally go back four days in time to save a beautiful woman (Paula Patton) and over 500 others who died due to a terrorist bombing in 'Deja Vu', an unintentionally stupid and wasteful action thriller from director Tony Scott. Basic high-priced junk that throws in crazed science-fiction that only eggheads will care about or even try to understand. The film starts promising enough, but dies by its second hour with more outlandish and far-fetched elements that just do not add up at the end of the day. Val Kilmer does what he can, but is not utilized enough here and James Caviezel is totally out of place as our antagonist. Denzel must be congratulated for attempting to take the whole project seriously, but his choice to be in this production is one of life's major mysteries. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,5,24 December 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Along With 'Schindler's List', Spielberg's Most Personal Film
","Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.' is great cinematic film-making that was made during a time when films were quickly becoming harsher and more adult-oriented.  This is a film for the entire family.  The youngest of children and the roughest of adults can all watch this film and feel the same types of emotions.  A space alien is accidently left behind on Earth and it is up to Elliott (Henry Thomas), his older brother (Robert MacNaughton), and his younger sister (Drew Barrymore) to help E.T. 'phone home' and ultimately return to his home-planet.  Dee Wallace and Peter Coyote are also perfect in their roles.  The screenplay is amazingly smart and insightful.

Casablanca," Exceptional, Outstanding, Wonderful, Dominant, a Total Triumph
","If all films were made like 'Casablanca' it would be a perfect world.  Very rarely does a film move its audience the way that this film does.  The movie deals with a romance that just cannot be because of numerous circumstances. World War II is quickly turning the planet upside down and many Europeans are making their way to Casablanca to get visas to escape the Nazi regime. Paul Henreid and wife Ingrid Bergman are among the many who have made the odyssey.  However, trouble springs up when they must go through Bergman's old flame (Humphrey Bogart, Oscar-nominated).  More trouble arises with French military official Claude Rains (Oscar-nominated) and his strained relations with the Nazis.  It is a heartwrenching film that dominates because of an outstanding screenplay, amazing direction by Michael Curtiz, and superb performances by all involved.

The animated title character has been framed and now he is out to clear his name with the help of a human detective (Bob Hoskins).  Robert Zemeckis cemented his ability to make a film with this winner.

Minority Report," Way Down the List of Spielberg's Credits.
","Steven Spielberg's 'Minority Report', like his equally under-achieving 'A.I.: Artificial Intelligence', loses its way late and the all-world director proves once again that he is beginning to have trouble knowing when to punch the stop button. It is the not-too-distant-future and crimes have become a thing of the past as a new system has been developed to prevent crimes before they occur. Max von Sydow is the mastermind behind the so-called flawless system and Tom Cruise leads the special task force of police officers. However when Cruise becomes the man to commit a murder, he becomes determined to show that he has been somehow set up by snooping FBI man Colin Farrell and that the possibility of him committing a murder is ludicrous. Naturally a whole host of twists of turns will occur as Cruise does his best Harrison Ford in 'The Fugitive' imitation to clear his name and find out the real truth. The screenplay sputters way too much for the film to be a complete success. Spielberg's direction starts out strong, but he soon too becomes a bit overwhelmed by the whole project it seems. Cruise does a good job here, but he gets little support from the rest of the cast and soon he seems a bit out-of-place as the film progresses. Colin Farrell though does an excellent job here as he is easily the film's greatest plus. He adds depth and interest to the film when he is on screen, but to be honest his screen-time is not near enough. Spielberg continues to try to copy techniques used by Stanley Kubrick and when he does this the whole project eventually collapses. This was true with 'A.I.' and it is true once again with 'Minority Report'. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,20 July 2002
Finding Neverland," Searching for the Promised Land.
","Struggling playwright J.M. Barrie (another bravura role for Johnny Depp) gets inspiration from a young widow (Kate Winslet) and her four boys (led by Freddie Highmore) and the result is one of the most beloved children's stories ever conceived ('Peter Pan'). Fantastical cinematic experience with that pinch of comedy that mixes to form a demoralizing dramatic tale late that will leave you feeling numb all over. All-world performers Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie are along for the ride, but seem more like guest stars than legitimate characters. 'Finding Neverland' is a good looking picture, but ultimately the movie never does reach remarkable status. It just appears too British at times with Depp seeming somewhat out of place. The children do nothing noteworthy and this is a huge minus. They come off more as youthful brats from Carol Reed's 'Oliver!' who truly never did grow up. One of those pictures that will likely be judged based upon your mood when seeing it. Tone-deaf direction hurts its cause. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,5 March 2005
Training Day," Denzel Washington's Oscar-Winning Turn Saves the Day Here.
","'Training Day' is an intense cop flick that tries to show the mean streets of Los Angeles through the eyes of a young cadet wanting to be a detective (Ethan Hawke in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance). Of all the cops to have a day with, Hawke gets to ride with the fiery and out-of-control Denzel Washington (in an electric Oscar-winning turn). Washington is a rogue cop who runs everything everywhere he goes. However, Washington has a hidden secret that could cost him his life by the end of the day. The film could best be described as 'The Los Angeles Connection' (ala 'The French Connection' 30 years ago) and Denzel Washington makes Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman in 'The French Connection') look like an eagle scout. Washington dominates the action and is the much-needed 'fire' in 'Training Day'. On the opposite side of the coin is the equally riveting Ethan Hawke who acts as the 'ice' to counter-act Washington's heat. Hawke is trapped in a situation where he sees all, but what can he really do about what is happening around him? Overall the film is a near-miss and really should have been a pure mess. Denzel Washington finally got a role where he could do what he wanted and more than anything 'Training Day' is just an exhibition for Washington's out-of-this-world talents. With that said this is not Washington's greatest performance (I am partial to 'The Hurricane' myself). Washington has made himself great by playing somewhat quiet and sympathetic characters and this role is the exact polar opposite of that. Ethan Hawke is super and this film truly put him into a higher class of actors. The research of this film is pretty impressive as the film-makers shot in real rough neighborhoods in Los Angeles and many real-life gang-bangers and thugs are prevalent throughout the film. Cameos by musical superstars Macy Gray, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really some of the strongest scenes as all three do fine jobs in limited screen-time. Too many coincidences, a somewhat ridiculous confrontation between Washington and Hawke near the end and Washington's side-story are the main things I found a bit out-there. But in the end the film served its purpose: getting Washington the Best Actor Oscar. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,12,1 April 2002
Friday Night Lights," Remember the Panthers.
","H.G. Bissinger's highly controversial novel about the Odessa Permian Panthers hits the big screen in 'Friday Night Lights', one of the finest films ever produced. 1988 Odessa, Texas is a place where most things are not as good as they could be. The one thing that the people of the city have to hang their hats on is the local high school football team and the high probability that the team could win the state 5A championship. Things don't always go as planned though as head coach Billy Bob Thornton gets thrown a curve-ball quickly as his all-world running back (Derek Luke of 'Antwone Fisher' glory) suffers a season-ending injury. Now it is up to quarterback Lucas Black (who worked with Thornton way back in 1996 in the modern classic 'Sling Blade') and teammates Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson and Lee Thompson Young to keep the team's lofty championship hopes alive. Also along for the ride is cinematic newcomer Tim McGraw (of country music fame) who nearly steals the show as Hedlund's alcoholic and disillusioned father who tries to relive his high school glory days through his emotionally tortured son. Director Peter Berg (best known for acting in the slightly popular television drama 'Chicago Hope' and in the surprise hit 'The Last Seduction') shows an amazing grasp for this subject matter. He is a deceptively strong director who has immense talent and first-rate vision. The bleakness and hopelessness of West Texas is shown with beautiful cinematography. The narrative tone is right on key as the production does not sell out like 'Varsity Blues' or other lesser teen exploit flicks. Every character is complex and motivated by the opportunity that the team presents. Thornton is a revelation. He is easily one of the most talented and under-rated performers in Hollywood today. His credits are sometimes hit-and-miss, but Thornton is always consistent regardless of the project. The kids give landmark turns as well with Luke improving on the momentum he built in 'Antwone Fisher' and Black continues to grow as a legitimate young actor. 'Friday Night Lights' is the greatest homage to Texas since 'Giant'. Like 'Giant', this movie is more of a religious experience than a simple cinematic viewing. It also strikes a chord when dealing with small-town life ala classics 'Hoosiers' and 'The Last Picture Show'. Emotionally-charged, intelligently portrayed and wonderfully executed, 'Friday Night Lights' is one of those movies whose brightness will likely never fade. Sometimes you truly do find heroes in the most unlikely places. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,7,15 November 2004

Erin Brockovich," Steven Soderbergh's Other Film From 2000
","'Erin Brockovich' will likely be remembered as director Steven Soderbergh's other film from the year 2000 ('Traffic') and of course for Julia Roberts' Oscar-winning performance. The film is not on par with 'Traffic', but is still a great picture that may have been the second best film from the year. The titled character is an unconventional legal assistant whose greatest attributes are common sense and the ability to interact with anyone and everyone, no matter the situation. After mercifully receiving a job from small-time attorney Albert Finney (Oscar-nominated), Brockovich learns that the powerful Pacific Gas & Electric Company is dumping hexavalent chromium in an isolated area. This is causing many residents to become sick with strange types of cancers and other illnesses. What follows is one of the largest lawsuits in United States legal history. 'Erin Brockovich' works because of dynamite performances by Roberts and Finney. This is easily the best work of Roberts' career and might be Finney's best performance as well.

Citizen Kane," The Greatest Film Ever Made? Who Am I to Argue?
","If there was a ever a film that became a trail-blazer for every other great film of its kind, it is 'Citizen Kane'.  Oh sure there were great films before 'Citizen Kane' ('All Quiet on the Western Front', 'It Happened One Night', 'Gone With the Wind'), but none of those films, as great as they were, struck a nerve within the viewer like 'Citizen Kane' does.  Orson Welles (Oscar-nominated in acting and directing, Oscar-winning in writing) shows unmatched talent at the ripe old age of 26.  A young reporter tries to discover what was meant by 'Rosebud', Kane's last word on his deathbed, by interviewing those that were closest to him during his life.  What follows are flashbacks into Kane's past.  Kane's ambition leads to success, money, and basically anything he wants.  He marries a beautiful young woman and they have a son almost immediately.  However, as time passes Kane's ambition destroys his marriage.  While Kane is making moves to get into high political offices, he is caught in a web of circumstance (being in a lady friend's apartment) and loses his wife and son.  Then they are killed in a automobile accident.  This knocks Kane down even further into an abyss of depression.  He marries the young friend and tries to turn her into a star, now realizing that he is basically ruined politically.  His newspaper still flourishes, but at what cost?  As he gains material possessions, he loses all those closest to him and becomes a recluse at his elderly age.  He rarely leaves his huge mansion, he ages terribly, and in the end not even Kane can escape the grips of death.  Through it all, everything is explained about Kane with his final word 'Rosebud' in the end.  The film is dark, heartrending, and overall brilliant in every sense.  Orson Welles was the catalyst, he drove everyone to the limits.  Gregg Toland's cinematography is revolutionary, nothing like his camera-work had ever been done before.  So many great films benefitted from 'Citizen Kane'.  The list is almost endless.  'Citizen Kane''s timing was both a blessing and a curse for the film-makers.  World War II probably kept the film from being as highly-acclaimed as it should have been in 1941.  Oscar turned his eyes toward films like 'How Green Was My Valley' and 'Sergeant York' instead of the dark 'Citizen Kane'.  However, the film's greatness puts it into a realm that Oscar will likely never be able to comprehend.  It is one of the greatest achievements of the cinema and one of the greatest achievements of mankind.  'Citizen Kane' is one of those things in this world that makes life great and worth living.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,8,24 October 2000

Wuornos, a cheap Florida prostitute, is raped one night by one of her charges and is forced to kill him in self-defense. Something snaps though and the event turns her into a murderer who deems it necessary to kill other men who pay for her services. Also along for the crazed ride is a young girl (Christina Ricci) who seems to be the only beacon of light (and it flickers sporadically) and love (and although lovers, their relationship is strained to put it mildly) in the sordid mixture. Theron's risk here pays off huge dividends. The exotic beauty decided to go through a complete physical transformation that is both fascinating and admittedly a bit horrifying. Ricci seems out of place in the end, but honestly I think her character is meant to be that way from the start. 'Monster' is a slap in the face that colors everything in oddly tinted shades that will leave you feeling numb and even confused.

The Rookie," Not Quite a Homerun.
","Overall good little film based on a true story about a chemistry teacher (Dennis Quaid) in Big Lake Reagan County, Texas who still harbors thoughts about someday playing baseball in the Major Leagues. He coaches a rag-tag bunch of players at the town's high school and challenges them to start playing up to their capabilities in the hopes of keeping the program alive. He makes a deal with them that he will try out for the big leagues if they start playing the way they are supposed to. Naturally all goes well as the team makes it to the Texas Class 2A U.I.L. Baseball Tournament. Now it is Quaid's turn to hold up his end of the bargain. So he tries out and the newly-formed Tampa Bay Devil Rays show great interest and hire him to a minor league deal. What follows is a long and sometimes seemingly hopeless journey to be called up to the majors. 'The Rookie' is a film that really starts to tire in its second half. It starts off so well and the footage of Quaid coaching his players in Big Lake is really excellent, but when the focus shifts squarely to him the project struggles to stay above water. After a while it seems that Quaid's character is just a selfish person who wants to do whatever he wants with utter disregard for his wife,  children and career back home. Dennis Quaid does a good job here, but he lacks the support that made him so much better in greater films ('The Right Stuff', 'Innerspace', 'Traffic').

The Birth of a Nation," Should Only Be Experienced for Its Early Cinematic Processes.
","Completely over-rated would-be-masterpiece that is easily the most racist and most degrading movie ever produced depicting African-Americans. 'The Birth of a Nation'. Is it a good film? Certainly because of the performances, the coherency and its focused tone. Is it landmark? Definitely, because of D.W. Griffith's impressive and innovative film-making techniques. Is it politically correct? No, not in 1915 and it becomes more politically incorrect as the years pass us by. The movie starts off very dramatically as the Civil War of the United States splits families and friends in every direction. Anarchy soon follows as President Abraham Lincoln is assassinated. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation has (in the eyes of the film-makers) become a major mistake though as African-Americans have taken control of many governmental entities, including Congress and the Senate. Thus the way of life for white Americans is changing and becoming unsatisfactory in the process. Enter the Ku Klux Klan. In this movie the Ku Klux Klan is portrayed as a group of white knights, heroic men who are out to reclaim the way of life that is rightfully theirs. And of course all this leads to more turmoil for all inside the movie's vast landscape. First of all racism is the greatest social disease that anyone can experience in life. I do not like this film at all for its story, particularly in its second half. Early on the movie is very impressive in showing the way the Civil War tore apart the U.S. However, this production pales in comparison to movies with similar themes like 'Gone With the Wind' and 'Glory'. In terms of cinematic history, 'The Birth of a Nation' is very important. But its social retardation and its racist biases overshadow its landmark film-making techniques. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,8,19,10 October 2003
Memento," Highly Unique.
","Guy Pearce stars as a strange character who is trying to find his wife's killer in this innovative, smart and amazingly well-thought-out movie that switches back and forth between real time and stunning flashbacks. Pearce has a rare form of amnesia which keeps him from developing new memories. Thus he 'goes blank' every 10 minutes and this naturally makes catching his wife's killer near impossible so he must keep notes, take pictures and even tattoo himself to keep all the clues fresh in his mind. There is the suspicious Joe Pantoliano who could be the man that Pearce is looking for and the seductive but shady Carrie-Anne Moss who may have alterior motives of her own. Pearce thinks back to before his wife's murder and tries to put his illness in perspective as he has experience with another individual who had the same problem when Pearce was an insurance investigator. The film starts, stops and pauses throughout its running time by showing something happening and then showing what happened leading up to the event.

","1998 was a great year for films and it made me sick to see this film win the Best Picture Oscar and Gwyneth Paltrow the Best Actress award. 'Shakespeare in Love' is a witty, funny, but somewhat childish film that tries to make the life of a dull historical figure seem interesting. It succeeded in that regard with interesting characters and a watchable story (even though it is completely fictional). The production values are high and the costume designs are excellent; however the acting is sophomoric for the most part. How Gwyneth Paltrow ever beat Cate Blanchett from 'Elizabeth' is beyond me. Every other Best Picture nominee was better than this film; I mean all four of them ('Elizabeth', 'Life Is Beautiful', 'Saving Private Ryan', and 'The Thin Red Line').

","Loud migraine-inducing sequel which is made kind of like a two hour-plus music video with enough lights, cameras, and action to keep those with short attention spans happy for a few short moments. The movie takes off where its predecessor left off as Robert Downey, Jr. (in the titled role) has become a major international celebrity, but he has issues abound as the U.S. wants his weaponry for the obvious reasons. Meanwhile, arms producer/dealer Sam Rockwell and Russian recluse Mickey Rourke come into play as the antagonists. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances to obviously set up 'Iron Man 3' (I feel another major migraine coming on). And of course we have Gwyneth Paltrow (boring as usual as the love interest) and the usually dependable Don Cheadle (taking over for Terrence Howard who clearly knew better than to get caught in this franchise) who round out the main players in the all-star cast. Yes 'Iron Man' makes a load of money at the box office, but critically there is not too much to talk about. Downey, Jr. seems content with playing the ham (think 'Tropic Thunder' and 'Sherlock Holmes') as his better work ('Chaplin' and 'Good Night, and Good Luck.') seems a very distant memory. He has fun with the material and runs with it, in spite of the fact the substance is lacking in most cinematic areas. The screenplay is wishy-washy and Jon Favreau's (who also has a substantial acting role) direction does nothing to help in the end. Much like the original, this one is just a loud clunker that makes you root for the bad guys who keep up the intensity with their witty one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humor. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,4,8 July 2010

Naturally the sheriff's department is difficult to say the least and it appears that it may have even had a part in the apparent murders. Frances McDormand (Oscar-nominated) proved that she was a truly gifted actress as the wife of one of the local deputies (an evil Brad Dourif).

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pi-Rights.
","Wonderfully fun and entertaining sequel dominates due to the technical aspects of film-making and always intriguing characters. Most everyone from the first installment returns as Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, arguably doing equal if not better work than in the original) has a debt to pay off to supernatural captain Davy Jones (the always outstanding Bill Nighy) or otherwise be condemned to an eternity of servitude on a ship of lost souls. Of course all this causes the wedding of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley to be crashed and they get thrown back into high stakes adventure in the Caribbean. Director Gore Verbinski's franchise works most because of Depp as he becomes a cross between The Little Tramp, Detective Clouseau, Indiana Jones, James Bond and even Wile E. Coyote. Depp's character is one of the most textured and likable the cinema has ever seen (even though sometimes you don't know whether to love or loathe the guy). State of the art makeup effects, visual effects, editing, cinematography and art direction cover up the fact that the stories in the series are just window dressings to put seemingly every star and role player in breathtakingly action-packed dramatic and comedic sequences.

","'Rocky V' is the biggest downer of the series.  This time Rocky (Stallone) loses everything thanks (or no thanks) to brother-in-law Pauly (Young) and his poor decision-making in economic affairs.  Now Rocky is forced back to the unsavory life which was shown in parts I and II.  He finds a second chance when he runs into young boxer Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) and decides to train him.  However, Gunn has dreams of stardom and does not believe that Rocky has the brains to lead him to the promised land.  He falls in with a Don King-like promoter and soon his relationship with Rocky falls apart. Rocky meanwhile is slowly showing signs of permanent brain damage as he reverts back to being a moron and sees visions of his former manager (Meredith) in his daydreams.  By the end a showdown between Rocky and Tommy Gunn, in Rocky's neighborhood, is the only solution to this film's under-achieving script.  The direction, by John G. Avildsen, never does take off and the film is grounded throughout due to this fact.  Once again the characters keep the interest of the audience, but in the end they cannot save this disappointment.  Overall this was probably the weakest of the entire series.  2 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,2,29 July 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," As Rare This Summer As a Black Pearl.
","In a summer where most everything has been little more than shark bait, it is refreshing to see a truly enjoyable blockbuster like 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'. A production that is very reminiscent of those old Saturday serials and even more closely the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy that dominated the 1980s, the movie is a dominant success by the time it completes its voyage. It is the mid-1700s and the breathtaking Keira Knightley (who has already made a name for herself this year with 'Bend It Like Beckham') has been kidnapped by a band of ghostly pirates led by the always dependable Geoffrey Rush. It seems that Knightley possesses a medallion that may bring Rush and his crew back to life. However the medallion is far from one of a kind and it is far from certain if Knightley is even the person they need for their deviant scheme to work. Now it is up to blacksmith Orlando Bloom (who has become an international sensation with 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) and outrageous pirate Johnny Depp (in arguably his finest role) to save the day. Knightley's uptight father (Jonathan Pryce) and would-be fiance (Jack Davenport) add well-timed comedic turns in limited action. Director Gore Vabinski (who impressed me verily last year with the atmospheric thriller 'The Ring') is beginning to show a real knack for handling large productions. Admittedly the film is a little long and suffers from sometimes uninspired writing, but the strong cast and the mind-blowing visual effects are more than enough to make 'Pirates of the Caribbean' one of the more likable productions of 2003. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,6,24 August 2003

Beauty and the Beast," The Only Animated Film Nominated for a Best Picture Oscar
","'Beauty and the Beast' may not be the best animated film ever made, but its 1991 Best Picture Oscar nomination puts it in a very select class of films. A class that does not include other great animated classics like 'Snow White', 'Fantasia', 'Pinocchio', 'Cinderella', and 'The Lion King'.  There is something about this film that makes it stand out from other animated classics.  The storyline is superb, the music and songs are perfect, and the direction (yes, the film's direction) is focused and unrelenting.

The English Patient," An Old Time Epic Made in the Present
","What swept viewers off their feet about this film is the way it is made like so many other great epics of the golden age of Hollywood.  However, this film is so ambitious it nearly collapses under its own weight.  Anthony Minghella's tight direction and Juliette Binoche's Oscar-winning performance are the main factors that keep the film afloat.  The film takes place in 1944 but flashes back to the late 1930s and to a plane being shot down. The only survivor of the plane, a burned pilot only known as 'The English Patient', tells his story to a French-Canadian nurse played by Binoche.  At times the flashbacks become tedious and Binoche saves the film on more than one occasion.  Ralph Fiennes probably has his best performance to date, but Kristin Scott Thomas's character never engrossed me the way the film makers had wished.  Willem Dafoe's quiet performance is almost as dynamic and dark as Fiennes's, in spite of his limited screen time.  This film won nine Oscars in 1996.  I cannot complain about this film winning the Best Picture but it will not likely survive the years as well as 'Fargo', which was probably the best overall film from that year.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,4,8,25 June 2000

The Notebook," Cry Me a River.
","Heartwarming, heart-wrenching, poignant, emotional, conniving, manipulative and forceful romance tale based on the vastly successful best seller by novelist Nicholas Sparks tells the story of two young lovers (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) who fall for each other in rural Seabrook, North Carolina over one faithful summer in 1940. Naturally there are problems galore though as Gosling is a commoner who works at the local lumberyard and has no real prospects while McAdams is a socialite just visiting for the summer. Soon it is apparent that she is going to be heading for the women's college Sarah Lawrence in New York City when the season is over. Her parents (caricature David Thornton and the always brilliant Joan Allen) are cold for the most part as they know that Gosling is way beneath their social standing. The typical romance between the classes becomes strained and it becomes apparent that the relationship may not work out. Gosling does not fret though as he swears to write to McAdams everyday. As time passes, the U.S. involvement in World War II forces Gosling and best friend Kevin Connolly (a real scene stealer) to go to Europe to fight for Patton's Allied Forces. Meanwhile McAdams volunteers as a nurse in New York while attending school and instantly injured army man James Marsden falls in love with her. A short courtship, and the fact that he is from a wealthy southern family that her parents approve of, endears him to McAdams. She also falls in love with him, finally putting the hurt of her time with Gosling behind her (she never knows that Gosling's letters are intercepted by Allen). Gosling returns from war and his loving father (a fine turn by the excellent Sam Shepard) has sold his home so Gosling can buy and fix up an old dilapidated house from the area. Gosling's promise to McAdams to repair the old mansion during their summer fling drives him to brilliant work, but self-destructive emotional tendencies. He drinks uncontrollably, sheds himself from others and has a loveless physical relationship with young war widow Jamie Brown (in a well-timed and very convincing role). A crazy twist of fate then leads McAdams back to North Carolina. She finally starts to rekindle the immense love she once felt for him while his love for her continues to burn as bright as ever. We all know that there are consequences abound for McAdams though as she is now engaged to Marsden and still falls in line when confronted by her domineering mother. The whole story goes on through flashbacks as in the present-day a kind elderly man (arguably James Garner's crowning achievement) reads to a fellow nursing home occupant (Gena Rowlands) who is suffering through Alzheimer's Disease. The titled item is read to Rowlands everyday by Garner in the hopes that she will always be reminded of the story and hopefully always moved by it. My goodness 'The Notebook' is an emotionally charged candy cane of near epic proportions that is so sweet that you might get diabetes watching it. The film does its best to persuade and make the audience feel the way it wants you to feel that it turns those watching into slaves to the story. So help me, I liked being a slave to this picture. It is not near as complicated and creative a story as it would make itself out to be, but it knows exactly which buttons to push and when to push them as the old Hollywood formula (which has been around since the late-1910s in the cinema) sucks its viewers in. This film is not as good as many wonderful romances of the past (everything seems mixed here from 'Casablanca' to 'It's a Wonderful Life' to 'Summer of '42' to 'Annie Hall' to 'Cinema Paradiso' to 'Titanic' to 'Love Actually' and everything else in-between), but it will still grab and hug at you tightly. Nick Cassavetes (Rowlands' real-life son) is a deceptively clever director that knows how to use tone and varying film-making principles to literally move his audience at will just as he would move his characters to perform in certain ways. No doubt there are shortcomings and flaws here as the movie runs too long and sometimes talks down to its audience. But with these things said the project is a smashing success that serves its purpose. Garner and Rowlands are amazing as they have basically a table-tennis match of roles when on screen. Gosling (best known as one of Denzel Washington's players in 'Remember the Titans') and McAdams (who has a credit list of ho-hum films like 'The Hot Chick') do definitely have a heated chemistry that pulls you in almost immediately and never lets you go. The other actors are all perfectly placed with Shepard and Allen providing stellar screen-time and Brown (in admittedly a relatively small role) showing the makings of an individual who has the  potential to have an exciting film career. Beautifully scripted by Jeremy Leven (maybe a bit too beautifully done if possible), 'The Notebook' will engrave itself on you. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,49,80,1 July 2004

","Animals from New York's Central Park are shipwrecked at the titled location after they unwittingly make people think they want to go back to the wild. Simplistic story-telling with neat animation and admittedly interesting characters across the board. 'Madagascar' is a highly innovative animated feature that nearly goes to a dark place as the four friends must adapt and learn to take care of themselves in a totally foreign environment for each. However, this is meant to be entertainment for the youngest of age groups as the jokes are tongue-in-cheek all the way. The voice characterizations are adequate, but far from excellent. In the end, the production was a slight winner with me but it may pale to other recent movies of the same kind for more critical viewers. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,1,8 June 2005
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," How Far South Can You Go?
","'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' starts off like a ball of fire with our youthful heroes (Stan, Kyle, Eric and Kenny) sneaking into an R-rated Canadian feature that is little more than an exercise in profanity. Of course the aforementioned kids spread their colorful verbal antics to the other children at their elementary school and soon the parents are in an uproar, so much so that military action against Canada and the executions of the duo from the film seem imminent. No 'South Park' entry is complete without Kenny being killed. But this time he goes to Hell and we see that Satan himself and Saddam Hussein are just waiting for the events to transpire so that they can rule the world. Amazingly Hussein becomes the dominant figure in a strange sexual relationship that he has with the Prince of Darkness (no kidding folks). Censorship, v-chips, crazed musical interludes and constant vulgarity dominate the action from minute one through minute 80. 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' just does not play as well as the Comedy Central series. Length becomes a real issue as the characters are not totally successful being transferred to the silver screen. The film would have been about the same with an hour cut out. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone do everything possible to offend and insult their audience. Nothing is to be taken too seriously though (you just have to realize that Parker and Stone are little more than hacks that make up for their lack of talent by being as outrageous as possible). Anyway the movie is hit and miss. Some of the gags are hilarious, while some are just disastrous mistakes. Surprisingly the musical numbers may be the picture's greatest strengths.

","'Elizabeth' is a nice little film that tries to be big.  The production design, costume design, and direction are all wonderful.  However, all these elements take away from every actor in the film.  Every actor except Cate Blanchett, who gives a stunning performance and should have won the Best Actress Oscar in 1998.  Her transformation from naive child to powerful queen over the course of the film is remarkable.  She is a definite scene-stealer and when she is not on screen the film seems to sputter. Geoffrey Rush has his usual fine performance as well.  Others like Joseph Fiennes, Chris Eccleston, and Richard Attenborough seem to be overwhelmed by the film itself and give fair performances at best.  All in all it was worthy of seven Oscar nods, but for the most part only because of Blanchett. 4 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,3,25 June 2000

This sequel adds a few more characters and keeps everything interesting and fast-moving with quirky situations, high-paced action and unforgettable one-liners.

Spider-Man 2," All the Extra Weight Almost Made the Web Give Way.
","Good but over-rated sequel to the blockbuster of 2002 has the titled character (Tobey Maguire) being torn between his personal life and the life of his alter ego. Of course he is in love with childhood friend Kirsten Dunst (who has had her dreams of becoming an actress become reality in this installment), he worries constantly about his elderly aunt (Rosemary Harris) and the fact that she is about to be evicted from her home and he continues to have a strained friendship with James Franco (who is obsessed with getting revenge on Spider-Man after his father was killed at the conclusion of the original). Also Maguire struggles with fatigue, an inability to pay apartment rent, mediocre college grades and a lack of steady work. Soon he questions if giving up the things in life that are most important to him is worth being a famed crime-fighter. And of course as all this transpires a brilliant scientist (Alfred Molina) is transformed into a crazed monster that is half man and half mechanical octopus after a freak science accident (which happened to be funded by Franco and his dad's old company). Dunst's engagement to newspaper editor J.K. Simmons' astronaut son and Molina's siege upon the city further escalate Maguire's mental and emotional dilemmas. 'Spider-Man 2' is a highly ambitious production (as was its predecessor), but really there may be a little too much substance here. The shared wish of a love affair between Maguire and Dunst borders on being annoying as the series threatens to become a soap opera rather an action saga. Really the screenplay (by Alvin Sargent who is best known for 'Ordinary People' of all things) tries to do way too much. I thought the various aspects of the original's screenplay were more than sufficient to the overall effectiveness of the finished product. Director Sam Raimi (who can definitely direct films of this type with triumphs 'Darkman' and 'Spider-Man') goes wild with special effects and crazed explosions that try to hide the pretentious script. This is successful for the most part, but honestly there were few new things to make this one stand any higher than any other production of the genre. Maguire and Dunst seem to be two performers who are stuck at 16. They just do not work great as adult performers. Maguire is best when he is Spider-Man and not Peter Parker. Dunst's routine borders on being a spoiled whiner. Molina is solid and he does as Dafoe did originally: he gives substance and believability to an unbelievable character. The rest of the players are all hit and miss caricatures. Distracting cameos by Dafoe and Cliff Robertson are silly gimmicks that were not needed and the film has a real problem with pacing as it runs a bit too long. There are tons of shortcomings with 'Spider-Man 2', but I expected them all along. The movie does live up to its ability to entertain and interest. In a film of this type that is enough to give a positive rating. Not quite as good as the original, but still a worthy addition to the series. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,8 July 2004
Batman Returns," One of the Biggest Disappointments
","The first 'Batman' was far from a masterpiece, but the second installment in the series is a dark and utterly disgusting mess.  Tim Burton's direction is so overbearing and mean-spirited that the film was doomed from the start. Michael Keaton does return as Batman and does about as well as he did in the original.  The absence of Jack Nicholson is felt throughout this film though.  Michelle Pfeiffer (Catwoman) and Danny DeVito (Penguin) never do add drama or intensity to the ultimately shallow and dull screenplay. Christopher Walken (Max Schreck) is also wasted as yet another super-criminal who wants to drain Gotham City of its power supply.

Writer/director Tom Hanks steals the show as the group's wise-cracking manager who is not around near enough to sustain interest as the movie grows tiring in its latter stages. Hanks' screenplay is a fluffy feel good time capsule of an era that many not of the age know little about.

Alexander," No String Can Hold Up the World.
","Long, opulent, frustrating and ultimately mediocre take on one of the most mysterious and interesting individuals who ever walked the Earth. The titled character (portrayed as a man by Colin Farrell) became the ruler of Macedonia as a young adult and went on to conquer Persia and advanced to India before dying supposedly of fever just prior to his 33rd birthday. The events of the film are dictated by Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) some 40 years after Alexander's untimely death and thus we have flashbacks galore. For the most part the movie jumps approximately eight years forward at a time, showing its primary character at the age of 3, then 11, then 19, etc. Ptolemy as a younger man (portrayed quietly by Elliot Cowan) was actually one of Alexander's military commanders and thus he should have great insight into his former ruler. However, Cowan makes such a small impression that he pretty much gets lost in the chaotic shuffle. Ditto for gay love interest Jared Leto whose part could have been eliminated all together in my opinion. The sexual undertones are a wasted distraction that finally lead nowhere in terms of helping us understand Alexander better. The women seem totally lost in this venture as Angelina Jolie's disillusioned and crazed Olympias comes out looking more like a silly caricature than a historical enigma. Rosario Dawson is also on hand as a wife that Alexander has Luke-warm feelings for. Dawson, who has never proved she has any talent on the screen, generates no intensity either (even when she and Farrell engage in a rough sexual interlude). Val Kilmer shines in an uneven part as King Philip (Alexander's father, who supposedly impregnated Olympias by raping her) and his relationship with Farrell is up and down the whole way. At times they seem like they love each other and then they turn on one another like upset cobras thrown together in a glass box. 'Alexander' is an intensely fascinating production. Co-writer/director Oliver Stone (doing his first mainstream work since the grid-iron dud 'Any Given Sunday') reaches to the outer limits here and sadly comes up empty. The style of this picture is unlike anything from any other Stone-directed film. In many ways spectacle outshines everything else as art direction, costume design, cinematography and even the editing are right on target. Vangelis' (best known for scoring 'Chariots of Fire') soundtrack is out of this world. As bad as this movie is, I was still mesmerized by its beautiful sound. The screenplay is a stylized train-wreck that combines myth, history and many personal assumptions (the film questions the way Alexander died ala Stone's conspiracy theories in the far superior 'JFK') to create a pudding of nothingness. A talented cast has trouble with the way the movie is set up too as the dialogue feels forced, staged and at times unintentionally comical. With all this said, I wanted to like this film a lot more than I did by the finale. This was a monumental attempt that really did not pan out. To be fair to Stone, I am not sure any filmmaker could achieve success with this subject matter. If nothing else, 'Alexander' makes me want to go back and study this part of world history. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,26 November 2004

Troy," Puts the Ache in Ache Man.
","Huge pre-release hype may have destroyed 'Troy' as much as anything else. This long, drawn-out, dull, pretentious, silly and highly disappointing epic shows that tons of money, a great cast, an excellent director and amazing technical and visual effects are not enough to overcome bad writing and poorly executed dialogue. This is of course based on the musings of Homer, a writer and philosopher from Greece who lived about 800 years before Christ walked the Earth. 'The Illiad' is the inspiration; it is a long poem that doubles as a novel which focuses on a very strange mix of mythology, fact and opinion. Helen of Troy (Diane Kruger) cheats on her Greek husband (Brendan Gleeson) with the youngest son (Orlando Bloom) of the king of the titled location (Peter O'Toole). Kruger and Bloom end up fleeing Greece and a war is declared. The ruler of Greece (Brian Cox) has dominated armies because of the excellence of the world's greatest warrior (Brad Pitt). There are strained relationships abound though as Cox and Pitt do not get along at all, even going so far as using military man Sean Bean as a liaison. Also Troy may have a hero of their own as O'Toole's older son (Eric Bana) could actually be Pitt's equal. Bana's captured cousin (Rose Byrne) gets close to Pitt and sees something in him that no one else seems to see while Bana's beautiful wife (Saffron Burrows) worries constantly about the fate of her husband and also the fate of her home. 'Troy' sounds more interesting than it is. Cox and O'Toole are dominant as the head honchos, but everyone else seems like they were just discovered playing beach volleyball on a tropical island and have no acting talent. The cast looks good as the men are muscle-bound and the women are red hot, but really the performers should have spent their time with acting coaches instead of personal trainers. This is a hard film to listen to because it just does not sound good (this is because of the screenplay and the crazed battle sequences). When the movie shows life through land battles they stop abruptly and another long stretch of empty conversations start up. Director Wolfgang Petersen really drops the ball here unfortunately as he cannot cope with the meandering script and he is left to try and save the production with spectacle and action (neither helps much though). A wonderful role by O'Toole is demolished by lack of screen-time and a total disregard for the complexities of his character. Just imagine 'Gladiator' with its good parts taken out and you have 'Troy', a gigantic disaster of epic proportions. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,4,10,8 July 2004

Williams is pretty good when he is on screen, but his air time is very minimal here. He appears and disappears at the Oscar-winning screenplay's convenience. The routine of reading poetry in a cave wears thin and the performances of many of the actors is far from being convincing.

Brokeback Mountain," Rusty Spurs and Blazed Saddles.
","A firestorm has swept through the land with 'Brokeback Mountain'. The very delicate and difficult subject matter has ended up being an attraction to critics and audiences alike. To say that the movie is not controversial and a playing field for divisions aplenty would be an outright lie. Though hailed in every direction, 'Brokeback Mountain' proves to be a much more interesting curiosity than potential cinematic classic. The storyline is near impossible to not know as two young men (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) in 1963 Wyoming come together to herd sheep on the titled location. A few weeks on the mountain pass and ultimately the two end up having a physical affair. Both men proclaim that they are not homosexuals, but yet everything about them points to the fact that they indeed are. Time and societal norms make the duo scared to pursue their relationship in public and they both go have seemingly normal lives---for a while. Ledger marries Michelle Williams in Wyoming and the couple immediately have two daughters. Gyllenhaal, still yearning to be with another man, finally ends up meeting the daughter (Anne Hathaway) of a ridiculously wealthy dealer of farming and ranching vehicles in Texas. He marries her and they have a son. However, the time spent by Ledger and Gyllenhaal in 1963 draws them back together in Wyoming. With each meeting, the emotions between the two become more conflicted as they contemplate the bond they have and the path their relationship will ultimately take. Over a 20-year period, their original and subsequent meetings will lead to emotionally draining and demoralizing outcomes for all involved. The fascinating thing about this movie is not really the story, but the fact that a Taiwanese film-maker (Ang Lee) directed it. Lee has a unique grasp on ultra-conservative places like Wyoming and Texas during the picture's time period. Overall though 'Brokeback Mountain' is highly overrated. The jokes we see constantly on the late night talk shows are all justified as the movie threatens to become a laugh riot on several occasions. The dialog tries to be poetic and sometimes ends up being preachy and almost achingly corny. Annie Proulx's short novella has lots of emotions and heart, but really the whole thing wants to be highly manipulative. The love story that has been so widely discussed is really nowhere to be found as the two cowboys seem more consumed with lustful inhibitions and the fact that their shared secret brings excitement to otherwise dull lives. Even with all these shortcomings, this is definitely not a bad film. However, in a somewhat lukewarm 2005 'Brokeback Mountain''s highly unique cinematic commentary makes it an above average film that has literally brainwashed many to believe it is better than it actually is. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,8,33,10 February 2006
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's Most Personal Film
","'Ed Wood' is a film, shot entirely in black and white, about the infamous film director who is frequently credited as being the worst director ever. Of course the film is quirky and funny, but also very serious and dramatic in some areas.  The film takes place in the 1950s when Wood is trying to make his name in Hollywood by comparing himself to Orson Welles (both being writers-producers-directors).  The fact that they have the same career is about the only real similarity.  Wood is trying to make it big and enlists the help of the aged, washed-up Bela Lugosi (played to the paramount by Oscar-winning Martin Landau).  In spite of the failures Lugosi stays behind Wood and they develop a very close friendship.  Wood's strangeness is depicted in the fact that he rarely takes more than one take on a scene, regardless of what happens during that scene.  He is also odd because he likes to dress in women's clothes.  In a funny yet sad scene near the end Wood declares that 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' will be the film that he is remembered for.  He is right.  However, it is an awful film from a man who may have been too ambitious to make it in Hollywood.  In many respects, 'Ed Wood' is a modern day masterpiece, a poor man's 'Citizen Kane' or 'Raging Bull'.  All deal with men who want to be great but always seem to miss the mark somehow.  Tim Burton's direction is gloomy and you can see how much he feels for this man who never accomplished his goals in the cinema.  The screenplay is sharp and Johnny Depp is unforgettable in the title role.  The supporting cast is also a real joy to behold.

","'Home Alone' is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe.  At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.  All the performers do well and in the end the film also does.  4 stars out of 5.",Null,77,98,4 November 2000
The Hustler," Paul Newman's Greatest Role.
","Well-acted masterpiece which has Paul Newman (Oscar-nominated) as the young hot-head who wants to hustle all comers at the pool table. He is the best, no doubt about it, but his cockiness and his inability to see the 'big picture' will lead to tragedy on more than one occasion. He shows that he is better than the excellent Minnesota Fats (played brilliantly in a short role by Oscar-nominee Jackie Gleason), but being the best is not good enough for Newman and he sinks himself. Oscar-nominee George C. Scott then takes Newman along with him to hustle high-class players, but Newman's naivety and lack of intelligence do not help out his situation. 'The Hustler' is also a love story as Newman and Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie self-destruct as Newman cannot control himself and Laurie cannot control a terrible alcohol problem. Heart-rending, entertaining, fascinating and brilliant in every way, 'The Hustler' is one of the greatest films ever produced hands down. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,3,4,3 July 2002
Insomnia," Lack of Dreams for an Insomniac.
","Interesting psychological thriller from director Christopher Nolan (the brains behind the amazing 'Memento') still comes up a bit short. L.A. detectives Al Pacino and Martin Donovan are called in to Nightmute, Alaska, a small town where there are literally endless days (no darkness) for parts of the year. It is obvious from the start that the L.A.P.D. is under fire for possibly tampering with evidence in numerous cases in order to solve crimes faster. Thus Pacino and Donovan are practically at odds anyway due to a potentially damaging situation. Immediately the duo and the local police (Hilary Swank in particular) track down the suspected killer of a teenage girl, but Pacino mistakenly shoots his partner in a thick fog. Naturally the others believe that the man they were chasing is the culprit once again and Pacino keeps his secret from everyone else. However the villain (a creepy Robin Williams) calls Pacino and tells him that he saw everything that happened and a complicated cat-and-mouse blackmail game ensues. Psychology starts to play into Pacino's head as he just cannot get any sleep (thus the title) and we are left wondering if Pacino might have really meant to kill his partner. 'Insomnia' has that claustrophobic feel to it, much like 'Memento'. However the screenplay here ends up being cliched and unoriginal. Williams and Pacino are left to sometimes irritating conversations that do not seem to support where the movie is trying to go. Everyone else is wasted completely. Nolan's direction keeps the movie intriguing, but nothing truly exceptional is ever reached with 'Insomnia'. It shouldn't put you to sleep, but it probably won't generate your heart-rate much either. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,27 October 2003
L.A. Confidential," A 'Chinatown' for the 1990s
","'L.A. Confidential' is brilliant.  The screenplay and direction are second-to-none.  The performances by the ensemble cast are also superb. Kim Basinger stands out the most with her Oscar-winning role.  Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, and Danny DeVito all have their moments as well.  The film deals with the seamy side of Los Angeles in the post-World War II 1950s.  Los Angeles is a place of shady dealings and police corruption.  To add to those problems is the creation of the smutty tabloid.  Multi-layered and smart, 'L.A. Confidential' will be the greatest survivor of the films released in 1997. 5 out of 5 stars.",Null,175,207,25 June 2000
The Day After Tomorrow," And the Weather for This Week....This Can't Be Right.
","Disaster epic that reminds you of films that became box office smashes in the 1970s. 'The Day After Tomorrow' is fair for the genre, but ultimately its landmark special effects, haunting score, outstanding sound and surprisingly impressive cinematography is not enough to overcome cardboard-styled characters and a screenplay that really does nothing new or innovative. Climatologist Dennis Quaid believes that problems with global warming that have been ignored over the years will become real factors in possibly killing the human race in 1,000 or possibly only 100 years. Naturally his pleas to international delegates fall on deaf ears (most notably from U.S. vice president Kenneth Welsh). Of course we all know immediately that Quaid's predictions will come true and come true very quickly. Soon a whole host of characters get involved in destruction around the world as Los Angeles experiences killer twisters, D.C. falls to heavy snowfall and chilling temperatures (in the -100s Fahrenheit) while New York literally sinks due to heavy floods and future Ice Age-type elements. Quaid's son (Jake Gyllenhall), his love interest (Emmy Rossum), their group of high school academic competition players and a whole host of others (homeless man Glenn Plummer in particular) get stuck in the city's library. The test is to stay alive by staying warm. The entire country does its best to get as far south as possible (even going so far as to invade Mexico) to overcome the natural disasters. Quaid's wife (doctor Sela Ward) gets stuck in D.C. looking after a young cancer patient, while scientist Ian Holm and others become stranded in Europe. And through it all Quaid, assistants Dash Mihok and Jay O. Sanders go against convention to save Gyllenhall and others who may potentially survive the elements in New York City. 'The Day After Tomorrow' is pretty good with its tone (admittedly there are some thought-provoking and scary possibilities presented here), but the movie turns to old cliches and tiring screenplay techniques to add to its length. The human aspect is the real minus (this is of course a very huge problem) as so many good things get overshadowed by the most important aspects of the cinema being near non-existent (direction, characterization and screenplay). 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,6,12,22 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Yo-Ho-Ho........A Pirate's Life for Me.
","Once again a mind-blowing accomplishment of visual effects, sound, and editing which makes a strong case for finest blockbuster of a dire summer 2007 cinematic campaign. The third installment in 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' series sees a whole wide range of characters from the first two films linking up once again in a crazed and whacked 'Around the World in 80 Days'-styled saga where seemingly every player is not quite what they seem and all have their own individual motives. A dark alliance between the British (led by Tom Hollander) and ghost ship captain Bill Nighy has joined together to try to rid the globe of pirates forever. Orlando Bloom is still trying to save his father (Stellen Skarsgard), while Keira Knightley's own father (Jonathan Pryce) may be in danger. And of course there is Johnny Depp, the straw that stirs the entire series. In a wild and somewhat schizophrenic role, Depp dominates once again playing arguably the greatest cinematic character since Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter in 'The Silence of the Lambs'. Former Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush is back well-deservedly as the prototypical pirate captain, one of seemingly dozens from around the world that show up here (Chow Yun Fat is particularly memorable as an oceanic boss from Singapore). Even Keith Richards, who Depp's Jack Sparrow has always been said to be based upon, shines as the superstar's father who holds secrets for all pirates within. Once again, the screenplay is window-dressing to give all performers their moment in the sun. The film is nearly three hours long, but it still sails effortlessly through potentially dangerous movie-making waters to be a highly fun and entertaining crowd pleaser. Director Gore Verbinski deserves a standing ovation tackling a concept which has always had somewhat primitive beginnings (being based on a thrill ride at a theme park) and sometimes even more primitive story advancements. Technologically superior and just plain fun, 'The Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' is a roller coaster ride of epic summer proportions. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,4,2 July 2007
X-Men," Drawing Blanks.
","A world of mutants collide as there are the good guys (led by Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry), the bad guys (led by Ian McKellen, Tyler Mane and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and those trying to figure out their place in society (Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin). A U.S. politician (Bruce Davison) tries to make mutants outcasts, but his plan goes awry when McKellen has a deviant scheme to turn the entire planet into a diverse mutant race. 'X-Men' will be difficult to follow for those not highly versed with the popular DC Comics. The movie feels like it starts in the middle of its story and the lacking background is a huge minus. None of the characters are very well developed and the potentially fascinating premise takes a backseat to loads of special effects and crazed action sequences. Stylish and somewhat interesting but poorly developed and only minimally realized, director Bryan Singer's picture does not mark the spot for cinematic greatness. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,2,7 July 2005
Spider-Man 3," Spider Bites.
","Third and by far the weakest in the famed 'Spider-Man' trilogy falls way short due to characters that have apparently run their depth course, hully-gully direction by co-writer Sam Raimi, and a running time that goes way beyond the outer limits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) seems to have everything going his way. His girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst) now knows he truly is the titled character and they are about to be wed. Plus her aspirations as a serious stage actress seem to be becoming reality while his college career continues to take flight. However, there are evil forces that loom in seemingly every direction. James Franco is back and still seeking revenge on his father's death which occurred at the conclusion of the original. An escaped convict (Thomas Haden Church), who might have had something to do with Maguire's uncle's death, has become some strange sort of super-villain after a strange accident that gives the character human/sand-like powers. Then we have an upstart cameraman (Topher Grace) who wants to steal Maguire's spotlight at work, and finally a strange cosmic black substance that attaches itself to entities of rage. Still with me? 'Spider-Man 3' comes with too much baggage. The first two were heavy enough as they were, but this one is way too cute and smart for its own good. Too many side-stories, too many black and white characteristics of the major players and too many special effects-laden sequences that dull rather than excite cause this movie to be a gigantic bore of near epic proportions. It is saying a lot when B-movie ham Bruce Campbell, with his typical cameo, ends up being the most interesting and intriguing part of the whole flimsy production. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,1,28 May 2007
Match Point," I Know the Score of That Game----40 Love.
","Woody Allen goes totally out of character with this provocative and nearly outstanding dilemma of a movie. Former tennis pro Jonathan Rhys Meyers immediately falls for the sister (Emily Mortimer) of one of his ridiculously wealthy clients (Matthew Goode). All seems well in jolly old London until Rhys Meyers meets Goode's seductive American fiancée (another stunning turn from Scarlett Johansson). Interest turns to intrigue and then to lust and then perhaps to love or maybe a little obsession. Rhys Meyers begins to forget about Mortimer and fall into a twisted web with Johansson, but what happens when the plot does not go as planned and relationships become blurred? Allen's Londoners are just as fascinating and messed up as his New Yorkers. The change of venue is a refreshing alteration of pace for the famed film-maker and he nearly makes the whole project work with crazed symbolism and a reincarnation of that new-age style that dominated the European cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. The pacing is a bit off as the picture runs too long and Brian Cox (as Mortimer and Goode's father) is not around near as much as he should have been. Still 'Match Point' finds enough momentum to climb over that pesky net. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,5,6,18 March 2006
Milk," The Mayor of Castro Street.
","Closet homosexual New Yorker Harvey Milk (played superbly by the exceptional Sean Penn) decides to go to San Francisco in the early-1970s with young lover James Franco and live openly as a gay couple. By the middle of the decade the titled character is trying to reach political office with the hopes of becoming the first openly gay elected official in U.S. history. As the pre-AIDS 1970s continues, gay rights becomes one of the most heated and controversial issues of the contemporary time period. Marked with triumphs and ultimate tragedy, the film is a would-be powerhouse combination of gifted direction (by the always dependable Gus Van Sant), interesting commentary, and a dynamic leading man (Penn) seemingly making all supporting players around him better (most notably antagonist Josh Brolin as a highly conservative elected official who appears to have potential homosexual tendencies of his own). The subject matter is highly mature, the movie's pace is questionable at times, and the film is definitely flawed in many key areas. However, Van Sant's gifted story-telling ability (along with the use of historical archives and news footage) makes 'Milk' a fascinating film, albeit a somewhat over-rated one. Greatly influenced by the Best Documentary Feature Oscar winner 'The Times of Harvey Milk' which was produced in 1984. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,5,17 March 2009

This child will grow up to become the leader of an alliance of humans to fight off the terminators.  Even though this sounds really complicated, the film is never confusing or disjointed. Cameron's direction and screenplay carry this film.  Schwarzenegger became the celebrity he is now because of this role.

Gettysburg," Long, Drawn-Out Civil War Migraine-Inducer.
","The film that was supposed to serve as a jump-board for producer Ted Turner to make the very large leap from television production to the silver screen, 'Gettysburg' ends up becoming a trial of a film to sit through. It is a legitimate kidney buster/sleeping pill as the film runs over 250 minutes (not a misprint). The title says it all as the Battle of Gettysburg is the focus to bring a wide range of characters together from the Union and the Confederacy back in the summer of 1863. Most definitely the most famous battle of the U.S. Civil War was Gettysburg. That is why this movie is such a large disappointment. Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang (playing a different role from 'Gods and Generals') are the key performers from the Confederacy's perspective while Jeff Daniels, Sam Elliott and C. Thomas Howell dominate the action on the North's side. Writer-director Ronald F. Maxwell shows his shortcomings as a film-maker here as he tries to make an epic ala David Lean and ends up landing flat on his face. The production values are not as high as they should be and everything has that television mini-series feel to it. The actors struggle through with corn-filled dialogue and interminable battle sequences that looked rushed and un-choreographed. More dull than being in a sorry teacher's history class, 'Gettysburg' shows some of the worst things the cinema has to offer. It is an under-achieving dud of epic proportions. Would be followed by equally dim-witted prequel 'Gods and Generals' 10 years later in 2003. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,2,5,7 August 2003
We Were Soldiers," Better Times Than These.
","Totally ignored and under-rated in 2002, 'We Were Soldiers' was one of the top 10 films of yet another excellent cinematic year. The conflict in Vietnam is looming and the U.S. is about to get involved in some heavy combat and casualties are imminent. Mel Gibson leads the very first group of some 400 American men into a hot zone where 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers are waiting. What follows are intense fire fights and the realizations of love, devotion, admiration and friendship for all Americans involved. While there have been several excellent films on the topic of Vietnam, 'We Were Soldiers' is different from the others in the way it shows the emotional battles occurring back home in the states of those who are waiting for their husbands, fathers, brothers and uncles to come home. Madeleine Stowe, as Gibson's wife, is solid as she always is as the primary woman struggling with the events taking place overseas. A strong cast which includes Keri Russell, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliott, Barry Pepper and Chris Klein completes the strong film. Randall Wallace (who wrote the screenplays for the amazing 'Braveheart' and the disappointing 'Pearl Harbor') shows an uncanny knack as a film director. He uses an odd Frank Capra-styled way of telling a story that is highly dramatic and highly life affirming at the same time. 'We Were Soldiers' is an excellent film that should be embraced, especially in this chaotic time when other events overshadow the world of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,5,9,25 March 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Another Winner From the 'Class of 1969'
","'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is a great film just due to the pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. These two work so well together that the film would have been impressive no matter what. However, with a smart story and great direction by George Roy Hill, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' was the smash-hit of 1969 as it achieved box office dominance and won more Oscars (four) than any other film that year. It did not win the Best Picture or Best Director Oscars as 'Midnight Cowboy' and its director John Schlesinger took home those honors, but it has stood the test of time and is right up there with the other imperative films of that important year ('Midnight Cowboy', 'Easy Rider', and 'The Wild Bunch'). The two titled characters are two shrewd outlaws who love to rob trains and banks. However, the law has about had it with the outlaws and the two decide that Bolivia is the place they need to be. Also along for the ride is school-teacher Katharine Ross who obviously has feelings for both men. They both want to go straight in Bolivia, but temptation is too big for them and in the end tragedy will occur for the titled characters. Of course this film is based on real people, but so little is known about them that the film-makers were able to take many liberties with the tale. The film-makers went for comedy and action, but it is the drama and the likable characters that make 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' one of the best films produced in the 1960s. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,71,95,24 August 2001

Now Clooney and the gang must make $190 million over a two week period as they travel to Amsterdam and Rome to pull their heists. Along for the ride is a sexy detective (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who has a past with Pitt and a world-class criminal (Vincent Cassel) who wants to prove to the underworld that he indeed is the greatest international thief. Totally silly and over-exaggerated, but enjoyable nevertheless. Director Steven Soderbergh uses a proved formula and a top-notch cast to get his wild points across.

Crash," A Melting Pot on Fire.
","Outstanding allegory on our society and the views (both subtle and apparent) that we may have on others of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over a two-day period in present-day Los Angeles, a whole cast of vivid characters clash and crash into one another in an emotionally draining sparring match of wits, words and explosive outcomes. Police officer Matt Dillon and new partner Ryan Phillippe do not see eye-to-eye when it comes to law enforcement practices. Dillon's blatant racism toward African Americans immediately makes him an unsympathetic character who seems to be reeling due to the fact that he is unable to find suitable health care for his ailing father. A high class African-American television director (the always outstanding Terrence Howard) and his socialite wife (Thandie Newton) find constant struggles due to the fact that they do have the finer things in life and are part of a societal racial minority---something that many others just cannot comprehend or understand. A district attorney (Brendan Fraser) has political problems on top of political problems as his blatantly terrified wife (Sandra Bullock's finest turn) becomes a jumbled bundle of nerves after they are carjacked by two hilariously informed African-American thieves (Larenz Tate and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) who obviously have their fair share of philosophical meanderings. A Mexican-American locksmith (Michael Pena) tries to provide comfort and solace to his young wife and daughter as he attempts to give them better lives than what he has had. A Persian immigrant (Shaun Toub) who is near a breaking point after the latest robbery of his convenient store also gets thrown into the dizzying mix. His adult daughter (Bahar Soomekh) tries to be the calming influence in his turbulent life. And of course we have two police detectives/lovers (Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito) who try to make sense of senseless happenings, while having trouble themselves in their personal relationship. Paul Haggis' demoralizingly real and complex screenplay is revolutionary and his direction is subtly strong as he takes a backseat behind the camera and lets his actors run to the bank with the multi-layered script. Highly intelligent and thought-provoking in its 'this is happening right now' approach, 'Crash' literally runs over its audience with strong cinematic executions and conclusions. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,5,10 February 2006

The Best Years of Our Lives," Strong Cinematic Event.
","Almost epic film that shows that the end of World War II does not necessarily mean the end of heartache and sorrow. Three servicemen (Oscar winners Fredric March and Harold Russell along with excellent character-actor Dana Andrews) are finally coming back to their small town after the war ends. They have never met before, but share a common bond due to their horrific experiences overseas. March has had a wandering eye while off to war and this creates sparks with wife Myrna Loy. The fact that he has also developed a bad drinking habit only adds to the couple's problems. Andrews has been two-timed by wife Virginia Mayo and he starts to develop feelings for March's daughter (the beautiful Teresa Wright). Russell, a sailor who lost both hands in the war, comes home and has trouble relating to his family and his fiance (Cathy O'Donnell) as he becomes embarrassed by the awkwardness he has with his hooks that act as his new hands. It is also made quite clear that fighting for your country does not necessarily mean a hero's welcome back as job opportunities are few and far between as the national economy adjusts to the fact that the war effort is no more. And of course there are those few in the U.S. who look down upon World War II veterans all together, questioning their motives and deeds. This film, directed by Oscar-winner William Wyler, pulls no punches in telling an important story that many would have stayed away from. Keep in mind this was made in 1946. The war was still very fresh in everyone's mind. March was truly one of the most under-rated actors of any era as he gives his finest performance here. Non-actor Harold Russell, who lost his hands ironically on D-Day (June 6, 1944) while he was back in the states (North Carolina) instructing paratroopers when some TNT went off in his hands, gives one of the most memorable roles ever captured on film. He remains the only actor in history to receive two Oscars for one role (he won a competitive Best Supporting Actor Oscar and an honorary Oscar as well). A moving and highly emotional event. With the exception of 'Citizen Kane' and 'Casablanca', arguably the finest film produced during the finest cinematic decade ever. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,5,7 July 2002
Closer," Sex, Lies and a Lot of Emotional Red Tape.
","Sensationally realized adult-themed drama that is about as subtle as a sledgehammer with its electrifying performances, magnetic direction and hard-as-nails script. In modern-day London a struggling journalist/obituary writer (Jude Law) falls in love with a young American stripper (Natalie Portman). Their relationship is thrown a curve-ball when Law meets photographer Julia Roberts. Roberts appears to not be interested and Law unwittingly gets dermatologist Clive Owen involved with her instead. Almost instantly, Roberts and Owen start a love affair of their own. However, nothing is as rosy as it appears. Law is really in lust with Roberts, Roberts is quietly obsessed with Law and Portman is coming apart at the seams emotionally as she learns about Law's true feelings. While all this occurs Owen gets caught in a pickle as well as he realizes that there is much more to Law and Roberts' relationship than meets the eye. And a short conversation between Owen and Portman may also lead to more fireworks as time goes by. Talk about lovers and other strangers. Wickedly demented chess match of wits, would-be-loves, lusts, jealousies and cruelties culminate in arguably the most brilliant and important picture of 2004. The four leads create a crazed square in a dark and bleak London landscape. Each individual performer has an earth-shattering moment and each has at least one emotional sparring match with each of the other three co-stars. Symbolism is also a key ingredient in this recipe. The occupations of the four leads being the most important of examples. Taking place briskly over a four-year period, 'Closer' highlights its points with striking blows and difficult outcomes. Director Mike Nichols gets back to the wild and revolutionary film-making that shook Hollywood and the system with 1960s classics 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' and 'The Graduate'. Patrick Marber's screenplay, based on his equally potent play, is a demoralizing, cruel and mentally draining experience that paints a portrait of the lengths people will go to have what they want---the feelings and emotions of others be damned. Perfectly directed, wonderfully scripted and accurately performed, 'Closer' is sure to get next to the deepest parts of your soul. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,6,13 January 2005
Elf," Not Your Typical Christmas Story.
","Former 'Saturday Night Live' standout Will Farrell stars as a man who was actually reared at the North Pole by Santa Claus (Ed Asner) and a group of kind and loving elves (led by Bob Newhart) after he wandered into Asner's bag of toys by accident one night at an orphanage when he was a baby. Fast-forward 30 years and the secret is finally out that Farrell is really human and that his father (James Caan) hails from New York City of all places. Now Farrell decides to leave the only home he has ever known in order to hopefully fit in with the human world, but his transition is difficult with usually hilarious results. 'Elf' is another one of those productions this year that I liked even though there is really not as much substance as I would have hoped. Farrell, who was the only redeeming thing in the disgusting 'Old School', is basically given free-will to run everything in the show and ends up dominating with a consistent performance that is surprisingly believable and definitely comical. Everyone else is present, but Farrell proves to be a true comedic force almost by himself. Overall the good messages sent by the film, the smart Christmas undertones and some very creative attempts at entertaining its audience are all enough to make 'Elf' a strange winner that could best be described as the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,9 December 2003
Taxi Driver," On the Edge of Insanity
","'Taxi Driver'. Will the cinema ever experience another year like 1976? My goodness think about the five Best Picture Oscar nominees: 'Rocky', 'Network', 'Bound for Glory','All the President's Men', and of course Scorsese's disturbing 'Taxi Driver'. Robert De Niro (Oscar-nominated) is an ex-Marine who has been through Vietnam and survived, but will he survive the mean streets of New York City? He is not sure and his thoughts make it apparent that he will destroy those who may be willing to destroy him before they get the chance. Things start to look up when he falls in love with the beautiful Cybill Shepherd, but he blows it and it appears that no matter what De Niro will always do something to keep himself alone. Friend and fellow driver Peter Boyle tries to show De Niro that things are not as bad as they appear, but fails in his attempt. Now De Niro's thoughts become more outrageous and he gets an idea to assassinate a presidential nominee that Shepherd is working for and looks to rescue a very young Jodie Foster (Oscar-nominated) from her sadistic pimp (Harvey Keitel). Everything will become more outlandish and in the end everything will come to an end, but in the end, is it really the end? The film is dark, ugly, unconventional, and out-of-this-world. Martin Scorsese proved that he was here to stay with this one and De Niro only re-affirmed his greatness after his Oscar win in 1974 for 'The Godfather, Part II'. The supporting cast is super and even Albert Brooks makes a lasting impression in a short appearance as Shepherd's co-worker. Paul Schrader's screenplay is super and overall the whole film is an amazing accomplishment that stands tall against the other great movies of the 1970s and every other decade for that matter. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,3,12 October 2001
Capote," Always Be Tru.
","Famed New Yorker writer/socialite Truman Capote (played beyond comprehension by the seemingly always wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman) gets interested in a killing of a Kansas farm family in late 1959 and decides to go down south with childhood friend Catherine Keener in tow to write a book about the happenings. And of course that novel is 'In Cold Blood'. However, the project ends up being massively difficult on many levels for the titled character. The two young men who committed the grisly crime (Clifton Collins, Jr. in a dynamite role and Mark Pellegrino) are strangely fascinating and even somewhat sympathetic to Capote and ultimately he develops an understanding relationship due to the facts that they are underlings of society and he can relate because of his homosexuality. 'Capote' is memorable most because of Hoffman. In fact he is better than the film itself. The picture is so low budgeted that it has an odd feel to it. The movie only runs 98 minutes, but lots happens. However, it feels like there are missing pieces as the final product jumps through scenes with little rime or reason. Collins, Jr. (who was as memorable as anyone in 'Traffic' five years ago) gives ample support and substance to the flick, but the other co-stars seem like they cannot handle Hoffman's in-your-face part and the production's sometimes sporadic flow. Relative new director Bennett Miller certainly does craft a highly unique viewing experience with screenwriter Dan Futterman's adapted script. Thought-provoking and somewhat elusive, while not excellent 'Capote' does make a case for being the bravest and most memorable film of 2005. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,4,6,10 February 2006

","Ridiculous little film that has truck-driver Sylvester Stallone attempting to get to Las Vegas to win a new rig in an arm-wrestling competition and trying to get custody of his young son (David Mendenhall) after his ex-wife passes away from a long illness. Naturally there is the evil Robert Loggia, Stallone's former father-in-law, who will do all in his power to keep the youth with him. It is as silly as it sounds. A film that tried to intrigue with Stallone's star-power and a would-be smashing soundtrack. Typical 80s junk. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,1,6,20 July 2002
Ocean's Thirteen," Luck Be a Lady Tonight.
","The third installment in director Steven Soderbergh's 'Ocean's' saga. This time Elliott Gould is nearly frightened to death with strong-arm tactics by crazed casino magnate Al Pacino. Thus our cast of demented heroes come together to get even with Pacino and his top assistant (Ellen Barkin). Cleverly conceived flick by the all-world director does not waste much time with exposition, but rather starts the ball rolling and does not let up until the end. Could have worked as a silent picture just as well as one with sound. Soderbergh continues to amaze me with his risk-taking film-making techniques. To me, it is like he is just experimenting here with 'Ocean's 13' and not even trying to make a cinematic masterpiece. It is fun and highly unique in its own special way and it matches the substance and style of the second installment and also compliments the original well. David Paymer is priceless in a short part as a critic who has his share of problems. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,2,25 July 2007
Lost in Translation," We Do Have Problems....But We'll Always Have Tokyo.
","Excellent motion picture experience that speaks volumes with crazed situations, quiet moments and moving cinematic expressions. Seemingly washed-up American actor Bill Murray (in his greatest role) has come to Tokyo to film an advertisement for a brand of scotch. Simultaneously young adult Scarlett Johansson is staying at the same high-rise hotel as Murray with her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi). She has just completed her education at Yale (getting a degree in philosophy), but now she does not know what to do with her life. It is painfully clear that both Murray and Johansson are suffering from jet lag and struggle to sleep properly. Their ailments go much further than physical time clocks though. Both are lonely, sad and isolated in one of the largest cities in the world. Their struggle to communicate with the natives and their want to just go back to the U.S. lead them both together. On first glance they appear to be total opposites except for their nationality. But it becomes clear very quickly that both do not have love in their lives and both are concerned with living in general. Murray is distraught at how his life has turned out while Johansson is worried about how her life is going to play out. Strangely Johansson sometimes appears as a window to Murray's past. His past seems to be filled with many similarities to Johansson's present state. Frequent phone calls from Murray's wife paints a picture of a partnership rather than a marriage. The discussions seem to go towards money and carpeting rather than their children or how much they miss one another. Johansson and Ribisi also act more like business partners than spouses. Murray, obviously a loving father, still wonders if having children was the right thing to do (a very difficult balancing act of emotions here). The situations throughout are often hilarious, but still poignant and effective. Everything in this picture has a deeper meaning than it shows on the surface. This is one of the deepest and more emotional films I have encountered. 'Lost in Translation' could best be described as 'Casablanca' for the Generation X and Y groups. The love story between Murray and Johansson is strictly platonic and as the movie moves along it is clear that they share a connection that goes beyond their ages, their backgrounds and even their personal tastes. Sofia Coppola's landmark screenplay and unique direction are revelations. She has a wide array of characters who come and go, but never loses the focus on her two leads. Murray is exceptional. He finally found a role that shows his hidden abilities and Johansson might even be better. This is bound to be a role that could make her a marketable super-star. It is very easy to get lost in this world and 'Lost in Translation' is probably the greatest picture to show just how true this is. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,0,2,11 February 2004
We Are Marshall," The Marshall Plan.
","A tragic plane crash ends up killing all members of the 1970 Marshall University football team unfortunate enough to be on board. Marshall, a college located in Huntington, West Virginia is devastated by the horrific events. Struggles aplenty take place now as the university tries to heal itself, but healing is not always simple or easy. University President David Strathairn must do all in his power just to field a team as freshmen were not allowed to participate collegiately back in those days. Thus, special permission must be received from the NCAA. New head coach Matthew McConaughey and an assistant (Matthew Fox of 'Lost' glory) who happened to not be on the doomed flight take center-stage as the two men who try to field a team in the face of the greatest of adversities. 'We Are Marshall' is full of cinematic syrup, like you might expect, but it really does not matter. The film works due to strong performers (led by Straithairn) and a truly engrossing and emotional story which rises above many other productions of the type because of its realism and astute character development. One of those movies which excels because of its heart more than anything else. Kudos to director McG in bringing this important event in sports history to the silver screen. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,1,8 August 2007
Barry Lyndon," A Film Which Struggles for Greatness and Almost Succeeds
","'Barry Lyndon' follows the life of 18th-century rogue Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) and his adventures (or misadventures) through England and France. Even though this sounds like a comedy, it is a film which is as serious as a heart attack.  Stanley Kubrick's direction is somewhat prodding here as the film lasts an amazing 183 minutes.  However, the screenplay, cinematography, set direction, and costume design are all brilliant.  Ryan O'Neal carries the film as far as it can go, delivering perhaps his best performance to date.  Everyone else has their moments, but it is O'Neal's show.  Kubrick's innovations here are on display as usual, but this film falls short of his earlier triumphs ('Dr. Strangelove', '2001: A Space Odyssey', and 'A Clockwork Orange').  With all this said, 'Barry Lyndon' is still a great film which ranks real high on the list of the late director's credits.  4 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,4,31 July 2000
Full Metal Jacket," Starts to Run on Empty.
","Stanley Kubrick's ode to Vietnam splits in two with the first half focusing on intense basic training within the Army and the last half providing insight on actual combat. The idealistic Matthew Modine is followed from his induction to the bloody battles on foreign soil. Early on Modine meets crazed drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (in an unforgettable performance) and learns real fast that military life is unlike anything else. Chubby recruit Vincent D'Onofrio gets the brunt of Ermey's wrath and also becomes an outcast among his peers. He heads down a dark, winding path of destruction that will effect not only himself, but also Modine and Ermey. When in Vietnam, Modine reunites with another fellow recruit (Arliss Howard) and more chaos strikes. Kubrick's direction unfortunately becomes a bit prodding and the climax of the production comes way too fast. The end of the film's first half will leave you shaken and nothing in the second half can match the dominance of the first hour of play. 'Full Metal Jacket' is one of those ambitious productions that ends up eventually losing its way as the clock continues to tick. Still a good film, but way down the list of great war films and great Kubrick productions. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,12 December 2002

Oscar-nominee Henry Fonda, his mother Jane Darwell (Oscar-winning) and their family have had it in the Dust Bowl. Thus they decide to leave the midwest of our nation's Great Depression and go to California. The film is an intensely dramatic affair that is first-rate in all cinematic departments.

Forrest Gump," Tom Hanks and Amazing Special Effects
","'Forrest Gump' dominated 1994.  The film was a box office smash and won six Academy Awards.  Tom Hanks (in his second Oscar winning performance consecutively) plays a simple man with an IQ of 75 who is somehow involved with every major American event from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s. Through his journey we meet his mother (Sally Field), his one true love Jenny (Robin Wright), his friend from the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise in an Oscar-nominated performance).  Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing visual effects and editing techniques.  'Forrest Gump' is an outstanding achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable.  The cast is great and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six years later.  Robert Zemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a household name with this film.  The screenplay is based on a book that was hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994.  It was the best film of 1994 and, with the exception of 'Schindler's List', may be the best and most important film of the 1990s.  The fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar over 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' just adds to the greatness of this outstanding motion picture.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,3,8,25 June 2000
"Monsters, Inc."," The Best Animated Feature of 2001.
","Over the years Hollywood has started to shun the Disney Film Corporation and this was evident in 2001 as 'Monsters, Inc.' failed to bring home Oscar gold for Best Animated Feature as the over-rated and somewhat annoying 'Shrek' stole the coveted award. 'Monsters, Inc.' (from the team that has worked on the 'Toy Story' series and 'A Bug's Life') is an outstanding comedy for all age groups that has important messages about acceptance, friendship and love. In a world of monsters, power is generated by the screams of young children. When a young girl is sucked into their world chaos strikes. The monsters are scared to death of contamination, but two lovable monsters (voiced by Billy Crystal and John Goodman) begin to realize she is not dangerous at all as they try to hide her from those around them. While trying to get her back to her rightful place they learn that power can be generated in ways other than scares. 'Monsters, Inc.' is a smart, innovative production that has merit in many areas of the cinematic machine. It is a good teaching tool to very young audiences on how to treat those around them. An instant classic. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,30 October 2002
The Godfather: Part II," The Greatest Sequel During the Cinema's History
","'The Godfather, Part II' is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,98,127,13 October 2001

Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day.  I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film.  'Fargo' was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved.

","The life of reclusive mega-billionaire Howard Hughes (dynamite role for Leonardo DiCaprio) from his innovative film-making in Hollywood in the late-1920s to the post-World War II era where he had to legitimize his role in military aircraft aviation and governmental spending. His relationships with movie starlets (Jean Harlow, played by Gwen Stefani, Katharine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett, and Ava Gardner, played by Kate Beckinsale) and confrontations with bigwigs Alec Baldwin (running Pan Am Airlines) and Alan Alda (the senator who ended up bringing Hughes in front of the Congressional Committee) are imperative focal points in this tale. All this and Hughes' never-ending bout with an obsessive-compulsive/germophobia disorder are the major keys in director Martin Scorsese's ode to a highly complicated man and old-time California glitz. Wonderful turns galore (also by cameo performers Ian Holm, John C.

American Pie," Typical Teen Film That Feels Like the 1980s All Over Again
","The 1980s ran rampant with two types of genres: the slasher flick and the teen flick. Of course both genres are just plain awful with very few exceptions across the board. 'American Pie' feels like 1984 all over again. This is a mildly amusing film that is fueled by sexual tension and ignorance as four young men (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas) vow to lose their virginity before graduating high school. The target date: prom night (big surprise). What follows are gross-out jokes aplenty with silly situations and crazy outcomes abound. While 'American Pie' is not a very good film, it does try to send messages about youth, sex, and love, but ultimately falls flat on its face. This film also launched the careers of many of its performers (Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Alyson Hannigan), but as with this film their credits are unimpressive to say the least. Eugene Levy is good as Biggs' clueless father, but the youths rule this film and that is not necessarily a good thing. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,3,17 August 2001

The Italian Job," Gets the Job Done.
","I do not know what it is about movies like 'The Italian Job', but I just love to sit and watch them. A couple of years ago was like a dream with 'Sexy Beast', 'Heist', 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'The Score'. Admittedly I do not like 'The Italian Job' as much as any of those four aforementioned productions, but I still enjoyed this film very much. Old-time master thief Donald Sutherland has hatched an elaborate plan to steal $35 million in gold bars in Italy. He has assembled a dream-team of criminals (Edward Norton, Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Mos Def and Jason Statham) to pull off the complicated heist. Naturally the robbery goes off without a hitch and it appears the six will get away free as birds. However Norton turns on his partners, kills Sutherland and takes all the money for himself. Fast-forward a bit and Norton is in Los Angeles living high, but revenge is still wanted by Wahlberg and the others who were double-crossed. Master safe cracker Charlize Theron (also Sutherland's only child) also seeks vengence on the man who took her father from her. Thus the five plan to take the remainder of Norton's money and take care of their enemy for good. 'The Italian Job' suffers through sometimes with an often silly and cliched story, but the production saves itself late with an outstanding final act that will leave your heart pounding and your pulse racing. The cast is all right and Theron is just one of those actresses you can't take your eyes off of. Norton is not really utilized as much as I would have liked. He ended up stealing the show from DeNiro in 'The Score' but he becomes willing to share the spotlight here with lesser performers. When all is said and done 'The Italian Job' offers just what it advertises: a couple of hours of fun without much thinking at the theater. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,5,10,26 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent Science Fiction in the Tradition of 'Star Wars'.
","Outstanding first film of the franchise which received a whopping 13 Oscar nominations and definitely makes a case for being the best film of 2001. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is excellent story-telling that is told in an epic style that is rarely seen in the cinema these days. The film uses new technologies and old customs to create an amazing experience. Elijah Wood is entrusted to destroy the most powerful ring created in Middle Earth and it is up to him to cast it into the depths of fire from which it came many, many centuries earlier. Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean and John Rhys-Davies make the large impressions as they are among those attempting to assist Wood in his all-or-nothing quest. Ian McKellen (Oscar-nominated) gives his greatest performance to date as he steals every scene and gives the film an element of grace that few could have done. Other high-class actors like Ian Holm and Cate Blanchett stand out among the ensemble. The movie is much more than entertainment. It is a film that shows that the smallest of people can make the biggest difference in the most important of times. The elements of love, friendship and goodness are major themes. All this makes 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' one of the best movies of all time. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,2,22 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Revolting.
","Horrible ending to the highly-popular, but very suspect series has Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and a faceless crowd of others trying to save the remainder of the human race at Zion from an army of heartless and ruthless machines. 'The Matrix Revolutions' continues the seemingly endless journey by picking up right where 'Reloaded' finished and confusion runs amok as Armageddon is the premise. Again Hugo Weaving is the primary bad guy as the leader of a race of controllers who want nothing more than to destroy Reeves for good. Characters appear and disappear and most are never developed or used the way they should have been (Jada Pinkett Smith and Monica Bellucci are prime examples). The undertones of the series keep on slapping us in the face and in the end we are left with a long and pointless special-effects heavy mess that has little coherency and even less intelligence. 'The Matrix Revolutions' is so full of chaos that every performer gets left behind in the dizzying maze that is the film. Not even Reeves gets as much screen-time as he deserved and the others just seem to be caught in a revolving door of crazed camera-shots. I never have been a huge fan of this series, but after the second installment I thought I might change my tune when I viewed this chapter. However I honestly came out feeling very cheated and highly disappointed. I saw no point in 'The Matrix' , I saw a glimmer of hope with 'The Matrix Reloaded' and I felt like I crashed into a cinematic wall of stale, loud and uncreative ideas with 'The Matrix Revolutions'. By the finale of this I felt like I was watching whacked 1980s-styled cartoons where 'The Transformers' were trying to save the Earth from evil robots bent on destruction. Completely empty, incredibly disjointed and very worthless, let's hope that we won't have to sit through 'The Matrix Reborn'. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,29 November 2003
Man of Steel," Super Still Isn't Really the Word for It.
","A young Superman (Henry Cavill) must finally come to terms with his place on Earth and his birth on his home planet of Krypton in 'Man of Steel', yet another cinematic retelling of arguably the most popular and beloved comic book superheroes of all time. Michael Shannon leads a group of militaristic Kryptonies to Earth in the hopes of resurrecting their lost civilization on a new planet and also along for the ride is Amy Adams (dare I say making us yearn to see Margot Kidder or Kate Bosworth instead) as our heroine/Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane who constantly seems to be putting herself in danger's way. 'Man of Steel' makes itself out to be revolutionary and creative, but it struggles the whole way with strange casting, an interminable running time, offbeat pacing, and a resolution which is more migraine-inducing than memorable (and also more reminiscent of something this side of 'The Transformers' rather than something from the 'Batman Begins' series). Flashbacks strangely are the most compelling and interesting parts of the movie as we are transported back to seeing a young Clark Kent in Smallville slowly coming to terms with who he is and what his true purpose for existence is. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner (Costner, in particular doing quietly some of his best cinematic work in years) shine as the titled character's adopted parents. Russell Crowe is also on hand (and never seems to disappear even after his early demise) as Superman's biological father/accomplished scientist of Krypton. Superman's home planet destruction is a fascinating side-board as we get deep into politics, failed science, and even an unhinged militaristic coup. In the end, 'Man of Steel''s main story pales in comparison with its sidelines and this makes the film basically a special effects-heavy would-be tour de force which unfortunately never does really take off in the end. A shame too because Cavill's performance and the aforementioned attributes were right in line to make 'Man of Steel' much more memorable and critically successful than it really is. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,5,22 July 2013
Grease," Wash Yourself of It.
","Unbelievably over-rated musical mess has motorcycle punk John Travolta meeting the pure and cute Olivia Newton-John over a summer vacation with a 1950s backdrop. Soon school starts back and by coincidence Newton-John moves to Travolta's California town. Naturally they both have feelings for one another, but both (Travolta in particular) are bound by their moronic friends and their youthful reputations. Each realizes they want to be in each other's life (with neither knowing what the other is feeling) and thus Travolta tries to change his image to get Newton-John to like him again and vice versa. Tiring music numbers and dull characters (except for Stockard Channing who steals the show as the leader of a group of would-be tough girls) make this one a tough pill to swallow. Still a movie that stands the test of time somehow. Followed by a sequel that is even worse. Mediocre iconic picture at best. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,5,26 June 2004

Newman's reprise of his greatest role is truly something to experience. He is at the top of his career in this one, playing a quiet and complicated role of a man who has been tortured by time, loss and missed dreams of total success. Martin Scorsese's subtle and focused direction stays on task throughout and he lets his three outstanding leads do the bulk of the work.

","The would-be inspirational true story of a mentally-challenged young man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) in 1976 South Carolina who was given a chance by a kind high school football coach (Ed Harris) to help the team and become a fixture around the local high school. Naturally some prejudices will take place as some of the football-crazed townspeople look at Gooding as more of a distraction. Slowly though Harris shows that Gooding is the one who is really educating the community with his natural enthusiasm, good heart, fine morals and undeniable human spirit. Up and down the whole way, 'Radio' tries to move its audience one way and then the other with predictable clichés and sometimes mean-spirited direction. Gooding, Jr. is pretty impressive here, but honestly he has done better work (remember 'Jerry Maguire' and 'Men of Honor'?). The same is true with Ed Harris who nails the kind coach who inspires greatness ala Tom Landry thing down, but really his part is more of a slickly-conceived caricature than a true three-dimensional character. Debra Winger is wasted as Harris' wife and youngster Sarah Drew's rocky relationship with Harris (her father) is only given a very minute glimpse.

Cast Away," Tom Hanks' Performance Is the Calling Card Here.
","'Cast Away' is an interesting concept that has been done before, but never quite like this. The film follows a FedEx man (Hanks, in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is stranded on a tropical island in the middle of the ocean after a terrifying plane crash. What follows is his journey to survive with minimal supplies (what he has on the island and a few packages he was to deliver) and no human interaction. Hanks gives a stunning performance and basically the film is little more than a way to show off his amazing versatility as an actor. However, Hanks lacks the material and of course the supporting performers he had in greater films like 'Forrest Gump' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. Helen Hunt is only present in limited screen-time as Hanks' love interest. In all 'Cast Away' is worth a look for Tom Hanks, but do not expect much more than Tom having conversations with a Wilson volleyball. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,14 March 2002

He Got Game," Fouled Out Pretty Quickly.
","Director Spike Lee's ode to basketball is one of those frustrating experiences that appears to be a possible slam dunk, but ultimately ends up fouling out mainly because of an uneven story and a nearly invisible tone. Denzel Washington is serving a prison sentence for killing his wife in a domestic dispute. While away, his son has grown to become high school basketball stand-out Ray Allen (a real-life NBA player). Governor Ned Beatty promises to shorten Washington's sentence if he can convince Allen to attend Beatty's alma mater. He has one week to accomplish his goal. Naturally Allen is outraged by seeing his father again and creates a shell to keep Washington out of his life. At first this seems like a good thing, but what if all of Allen's so-called friends (coaches, relatives, girls, agents and fans) are the true antagonists here and Washington is the flawed hero? Lee is never sure what he wants to do here. The movie plays out like a chaotic basketball game with lots of action and memorable action, but in the end you do not want either team to win. Washington and Allen's relationship takes up some airtime, but so do others that leave almost as fast as they appear. The corruption in collegiate athletics and within sports agencies is also given an interesting glimpse, but alas those topics are not explored completely. 'He Got Game' looked like it would match the brilliance of William Friedkin's 'Blue Chips' (a flawed, but important movie), but just does not seem to have the coaching necessary. Washington is impressive and handles the material as well as he can. Allen is a complete revelation. Anfernee Hardaway had stolen the show from Nick Nolte in 'Blue Chips' and Allen pretty much does the same thing in this one. Ray Allen seems to have unlimited potential in front of the camera and his gift could be developed more fully after his playing career ends. I have said for years that Ray Allen should be the best player in the NBA, but he has ultimately disappointed me throughout his professional career. Allen is not the problem here though. Lee's sporadic direction and a meandering script end up sending 'He Got Game' to the locker room way too soon. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,12,25,16 October 2003
Cold Mountain," Ain't No Mountain High Enough, Ain't No Valley Low Enough.....
","It is really pretty easy to describe 'Cold Mountain'. Just take the worst parts (the very few there were) in 'Gone With the Wind' and 'The English Patient', mix them together and you have this ponderous, long and sometimes down-right silly epic that is still somehow saved in the end and becomes a slight winner anyway in spite of itself. The Civil War is all but over. The Confederacy is going to lose, plain and simple. Death has become a way of life across the nation, but the toll in the South is truly monumental. Soon there are Confederate deserters that try to return home. Of course this leads to the historical fact that this group becomes hunted by not only the Union, but by the very forces they once fought for. One deserter (Jude Law) tries to return to North Carolina and the titled town found within his home state. The war has all but killed him (this guy has more lives than Sylvester the Cat) and the only thing that keeps him going is his love to resident Nicole Kidman. Kidman, who is not originally from the town, had come to Carolina with her minister father (Donald Sutherland) to start a new life and build a new church. All goes awry though very quickly as Kidman falls in love with Law, but Law has to go to war. Then her father passes away and Kidman, quite sheltered and helpless really, has no one to take care of her or work the land she now owns outright. Neighbors Kathy Baker and husband James Gammon worry about Kidman and send laborer Renee Zellweger (in easily her finest role to date) to do mundane tasks and basically keep her new employer from starving to death. Soon Zellweger's long-believed-dead father (Brendan Gleeson) and two of his new friends from the war (Jack White and Ethan Suplee) come to hide out as they are now deserters as well. Naturally there is friction between Zellweger and Gleeson, but still a mutual respect, admiration and even hidden love. As all this transpires, Law runs into every sort of character you can imagine. He meets up with a sexually-addicted holy man (a priceless turn by Philip Seymour Hoffman), a somewhat simple backwoods girl (Jena Malone), a drunken farmer (Giovanni Ribisi) and even a Civil War widow/single mother (Natalie Portman). Each meeting though is far from a safe one and Law keeps on dodging bullets and pulling himself out of rough situations with his undying will and his surprising intelligence. Ray Winstone (of 'Sexy Beast' fame) becomes the designated antagonist as he tries to rule Law's hometown with an iron fist. He and his band of cronies become dominant fixtures on the town's landscape and eventually become the primary assassins for Confederate deserters as well. 'Cold Mountain' is a very long picture, but it seems even longer than it is. So many things happen that your head is sometimes left spinning and sadly the picture even becomes a bore at several intervals. Law is quietly effective, giving a war-weary performance. He and Kidman really have very little chemistry though and they were never completely believable as lovers to start with. Zellweger is the real revelation. Her appearance nearly comes too late to salvage the production. She ends up smothering most of the shortcomings here all by herself. Writer/director Anthony Minghella's grasp of the book is not as tight as it should have been. He sometimes gets wrapped up in beautiful cinematography and art direction and loses focus of the would-be deep characters. Sadly the characters are really not as complex as they could have been or should have been and that ultimately makes 'Cold Mountain' more of an exercise than a joy. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,4,4 February 2004

Much darker and heavier than its predecessor, 'Kung-Fu Panda 2' feels like it is somewhat forced as the movie gets into flashbacks and chaotic action sequences which sometimes become distracting to the warmth and complexities of the key characters involved.

Absolutely great and life-affirming little film that was to 2006 what 'Sideways' was to the cinema back in 2004. 'Little Miss Sunshine' works due to a brilliant script and outstanding turns by the aforementioned performers. Everyone does the best work of their careers in this funny and yet highly dramatic slice of atypical American life in the early-21st Century. Although this group of people seems totally selfish at times, they all rally around one another unwittingly to get the little girl to her pageant in the hopes of making her adolescent dreams come true.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Falls Hard.
","A 'Terminator' film without writer-director James Cameron seemed doomed from the start and sadly the prediction would ultimately become a reality. 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' picks up several years after the events of the second film and John Connor (Nick Stahl) has become little more than a nomad, constantly moving around because of the fact he does not feel safe anywhere. Even though everything was supposedly solved at the conclusion of 'Terminator 2', Stahl cannot help but feel that danger still looms. He is of course right as a new terminator (in the form of the strikingly beautiful Kristanna Loken) comes into the picture and chaos strikes. Naturally Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a re-programmed terminator sent from the future to protect Stahl at all costs. Also along for the ride is engaged veterinarian Claire Danes who has an important role to play in the future. Skynet (ran by David Andrews, who is also Danes' father) is still the governmental entity that must be stopped, altering the future for good. 'Terminator 3' struggles the whole way through and nearly won me over anyway with fast-paced action and clever one-liners. However, the direction by Jonathan Mostow (a film-maker who does not hold a candle to Cameron) is never very clear and the writing staggers throughout. The final moments of the production are a huge downer too and it is made blatantly clear that there is always a chance for more installments. I was very close to giving 'Terminator 3' a marginal thumbs up, but the ending was such a mess that it soured me on that notion. Not in the same league with the first installment and not in the same cinematic galaxy as the second. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,3,4 August 2003
Doctor Zhivago," One of the Last True Hollywood Epics.
","By the mid-1960s the giant epic had about run its course and 'Dr. Zhivago' was one of the last true Hollywood epics that dominated the cinema in the 1950s and 1960s. 'Dr. Zhivago' is a very large film that shows the triumphs and tragedies of its titled character (Omar Sharif in easily his greatest role). The doctor/poet seems trapped in the awful Bolshevik Revolution of the 1910s and early-1920s in his native Russia. While having no real political views of his own, he just cannot escape a life of war and violence. We see him as a young boy and to his early adulthood when he marries who he feels is the love of his life (Geraldine Chaplin), but of course he falls later on for his one true love (a very young Julie Christie). Naturally there is conflict though as Christie is little more than a slave to the cold Rod Steiger and keep in mind that the shady Tom Courtenay (Oscar-nominated) is always around trying to create benefits for himself. Zhivago's half-brother Alec Guinness tells the long and sad story through voice-overs and flashbacks. The film is very, very long and it is not always a crisp running time. Sometimes spectacle gets in the way of the story and the actors and many times everyone just seems overwhelmed by the complicated screenplay and David Lean's opulent direction. Sharif and Christie are excellent, but the lesser the part, the more the others struggle through. Rod Steiger and Tom Courtenay seem to get in the way more than anything else and Alec Guinness has little more than a cameo appearance, his character could have been explored much further. All in all the film is impressive, but it cannot quite reach excellence due to several small holes in large areas.

"I, Robot"," Thank You Very Much Mr. Roboto.
","A strangely entertaining and highly interesting sci-fi action flick that goes above its premise due to wonderful cinematic technical effects, a clever little story and a top-flight turn by Will Smith. Smith is a cop in 2035 Chicago who is suspicious of a society where robots have become commonplace to help humans with mundane tasks. Soon the head honcho (James Cromwell) of a robotics corporation is found murdered and Smith knows that a creepily super-intelligent robot is likely to be the culprit. It is against the code of machines to commit crime and everyone else believes Smith has lost it mentally. Of course we all know that Smith is the only one who has a grasp on the situation, but could it be possible that nothing is quite as it seems? Bruce Greenwood is appropriately cold as the man who takes over Cromwell's company and Bridget Moynahan has her moments as one of the corporation's workers who gets torn between her common sense and Smith's thought-to-be skewered views. 'I, Robot' is a visual feast as the production values are highly ambitious. Smith's car is also super cool.

Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari, and Thora Birch do nothing special in my opinion.  Wes Bentley is also just adequate. The screenplay is excellent and the direction is pretty good by first-time film maker Sam Mendes.

The Alamo," About As Interesting As the Real Place.
","Sometimes history just never does really come to life on the silver screen. John Wayne learned this way back in 1960 when he starred and co-directed (with the uncredited John Ford) 'The Alamo'. The film was a giant bust and even though it survived due to a very generous group of Academy Award voters and friends of John Wayne, the mega-superstar was still somewhat disgraced as a film-maker and made out to be a performer who really knew very little about closed-doors Hollywood. Fast-forward 44 years and we have another version that just makes Wayne's version look that much better (not an easy feat to accomplish by the way). 'The Alamo' in 2004 is a myth- and legend-filled bore of would-be epic proportions that puts itself in the embarrassing class with recent flops like 'Wyatt Earp', 'Gettysburg' and 'Gods and Generals'. The setting is Texas from 1835 through early March of 1836 when the titled Catholic mission in San Antonio, Texas fell under a 13-day siege from Mexican dictator/royal military commander Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana (played by the admittedly excellent Emilio Echevarria). The ambush though lasted mere minutes as a few thousand Mexican soldiers finally stormed a make-shift military base that housed only about 200 Texicans (old-time Texans and Mexican-Texans who had American and/or Mexican backgrounds). Why did this event drag on for nearly two weeks then? Very simple.......Santa Ana wanted to get Texas General Sam Houston (played by the always drunk Dennis Quaid) baited into the large graveyard along with legends Jim Bowie (Jason Patric), William Travis (Patrick Wilson) and Davy Crockett (a strangely alluring turn by the always impressive Billy Bob Thornton). Historically Houston would make Santa Ana have his Waterloo (well actually one of several for the on-again-off-again Mexican dictator) with San Jacinto, a surprise attack battle that took place shortly after the Alamo disaster. Texan director John Lee Hancock (who had a little success a couple of years ago with the over-achieving 'The Rookie') gets caught up in silly dialog by 'Traffic' screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (I still cannot believe he wrote this script) and then gets mired in spectacle (which is not that impressive to start with) and loses the focus on his interesting characters (Santa Ana and Crockett in particular). Historically the film is not very accurate either. Crockett's final moments are mythical and the Battle of San Jacinto was a total surprise attack in reality (that is why it took less than 20 minutes for Santa Ana's Military to be defeated there). In this film it is made to look like a realized confrontation and it was not. Also Santa Ana got caught at San Jacinto with his pants down literally as he was in his tent with a woman aka 'The Yellow Rose of Texas'. That too is never shown here and we are left with yet another inaccuracy. In this situation the history would have been better than the script itself. In short none of the people who worked on this know too much about Texas history and it is painfully evident as the whole production becomes a long and tiring teleplay-styled dud. Patric and Wilson are totally unwanted. Jordi Molla (as Seguin) seems to be the focus early, but disappears before we get to even know who he really is. Thornton uses his down-home country boy routine to humanize Davy Crockett and Echevarria is the production's strongest point as the cold, brash and flashy Santa Ana. Echevarria is one of those great actors (making a real name for himself in recent triumphs like 'Amores Perros' and 'Y Tu Mama Tambien') who no one seems to know or care about. I really wanted a movie about Santa Ana instead of the Texans because really he was the only believable and reputable element of the whole winding mess. Brick by brick, 'The Alamo' falls with a tremendous thud that I saw coming before the first act even hit its half-way point. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,3,9,12 May 2004

","How can one describe 'Apocalypse Now'?  Well, it is certainly ambitious, perverted, wild, chaotic, insane, and overall exceptional.  The film deals with a war-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who is assigned to kill a Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a once great military man who has gone crazy and created his own civilization deep in the jungles of Vietnam.  While traveling upstream to meet Brando, Sheen reflects on his experiences and the film becomes stranger and more hypnotic.  He meets an equally crazy officer who 'loves the smell of napalm in the morning' played by Oscar-nominated Robert Duvall.  Duvall leads helicopter corps to overhead assaults of Vietnamese villages, destroying everything in sight.  More situations follow and the film twists and turns into more chaos.  Coppola's film was a near disaster that somehow succeeds through it all.  The screenplay is strange to say the least (I think that was the plan all along), but everything else is right on target.  This is one of the greatest war (or anti-war films) ever made.  'Apocalypse Now' is also the last great film made in the 1970s.  The performances by Sheen and Duvall are excellent.  Brando just makes a token appearance during the film's finale and he is hardly seen because the cinematography is so dark near the end.

'Silver Linings Playbook' is brilliant in most every way. The performances reach near epic heights with Lawrence leading the talented cast. The film's screenplay is deeper than it appears as it shows subtleties in its characters where you have trouble understanding who has mental deficiencies and who does not. In the end the movie is about humans doing their best, with the help of those around them, to find happiness and success against sometimes grim and seemingly insurmountable odds. In a crazy world, doing one's best in a dance competition and making that little extra money betting on the hometown Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL can become the most unexpected roads to individual happiness and group camaraderie. A definite winner. Kudos to director David O. Russell in keeping what could have been a schizophrenic screenplay (no pun intended) on the straight and narrow path to cinematic success. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,3,4,17 July 2013
Van Helsing," Unspeakable Cinematic Monstrosities.
","Super-monster Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his super-erotic wives (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran) try to get to Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) for a deviant scheme. The last of a family of Transylvanian warriors (Kate Beckinsale), the titled character (Hugh Jackman) and a technically sophisticated holy man (David Wenham) try to stop the evil-doers before it is too late. These Hollywood monsters have been around seemingly since the advent of the motion picture, but I do not believe that any other picture has been this disappointing from the genre. 'Van Helsing' is a loud and incoherent bore that tries to win its audience over with crazed visual effects, chaotic sounds and admittedly beautiful women. All this does nothing to make up for a terrible screenplay and mediocre direction by Stephen Sommers (of 'The Mummy' series fame). The characters get lost in the venture and really this would have been better as a long computer-generated exercise than a cinematic feature. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",Null,0,3,22 June 2004

","'Rocky IV' is easily the most ridiculous entry in the long-running series, but is actually better than parts II and V.  This time Apollo (Weathers) wants to fight a quiet Russian (Dolph Lundgren).  When he gets his wish, he is brutally beaten to death (literally) in the ring.  Now Rocky (Stallone) is on a personal vendetta to defeat the Russian to avenge Apollo's death. Of course he does and all is right with the world.  Stallone's over-indulging direction and script kill any chance of this film being a success.  Stallone's lack of material turns this into another film which plays more like a music video than a motion picture.

Dreamgirls," All That Shines Is Not Glitter and Gold.
","Three young African-American women (Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose) dream of super-stardom via the Motown route of Detroit in the 1960s and amazingly their fantasies of grabbing the brass ring may become reality with the help of a brash car salesman (Jamie Foxx) and a washed-up former headliner (Eddie Murphy). But not all dreams come true the way you wish they would. 'Dreamgirls' is the would-be charming masterpiece of 2006 that is really overblown and overrated. It is loud, long, not as smart as it thinks it is and just generally under-achieving in most major cinematic areas. Screenwriter/director Bill Condon (best known for 'Gods and Monsters') tries to hit the enthusiasm of 'Moulin Rouge!', the style and intelligence of 'Chicago' and the emotion and depth of 'Ray' and 'Walk the Line'. Unfortunately the sound and art direction drown out the performers, the story and the film's helter skelter tone. Hit and miss all the way 'Dreamgirls' is still a movie with more good than bad, but its red carpet treatment is not completely justified. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,1,14 March 2007
Being John Malkovich," What the?
","'Being John Malkovich'. This is one of those odd little films that is near impossible to critique. A fantasy of sorts about a struggling puppeteer (John Cusack) who takes a job at a strange office where he starts to work with an odd 105-year-old boss (Orson Bean) and a beautiful, but heartless co-worker (Oscar-nominee Catherine Keener). The office itself has six-foot ceilings and is located on the seven and a half floor. The weirdness does not stop when Cusack goes home as his wife, an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz, is struggling working with her animals as a type of researcher and questions her own sexuality and dreams of perhaps having a sex change one day. Still with me? Cusack becomes disenchanted with Diaz and falls for the cold Keener. Meanwhile he finds a passage-way which leads to the mind of John Malkovich through the office. He tells Diaz and Keener and more confusion ensues. Diaz now is even more sexually confused and Keener comes up with a plan to make money off the discovery by charging admission to all comers who wish to see what Malkovich sees for 15 minutes. Keener falls in love with the body of Malkovich, Diaz falls in love with the possibility of being Malkovich all the time, and Cusack wants Keener at all costs. Malkovich learns of what is going on, but what can he do? Cusack discovers how he can get Keener: go into Malkovich and stay there forever. This will also launch the career in puppeteering that he so desperately wants. However, boss Orson Bean and some of his other ridiculously elderly friends have had plans the whole time to take over Malkovich's body and live forever, but Cusack's plans have gotten in the way. Now they will do whatever possible to jump into Malkovich to keep from dying. There are so many oddball situations that the viewer's head may be spinning trying to keep it all straight. There are undertones aplenty in this film. Medical cloning, lesbianism, sexual obsession, sex-change operations, sexual threesomes, the question of mind-control, physical attractions, mental deficiencies, the rights of individuals, the mad world of media, the exploration of quick money-making schemes, the exploration of relationships in the workplace, and the general disdain of individuals in the workplace are all somewhat explored subjects in 'Being John Malkovich'. Some subjects are subtle while others slap you in the face. In all the film is a fantasy for the 1999 crowd. The only difference is that it deals with subjects that have been or could be more prevalent to the real world. Spike Jonze shows real potential here with his direction. This was far from a easy film to put together. Charlie Kaufman must also be given kudos for a creative screenplay. It is not quite a great script, but it is definitely interesting and unique. The performers are also good. John Malkovich does well with a strange role. John Cusack continues to show real versatility. Cameron Diaz does her best, but seems a bit out-of-place in a film like this at times. Catherine Keener is the bolt of lightning that keeps everyone on their toes. Her Oscar nomination was well-deserved. There are also cameos galore (big surprise). Sean Penn and Charlie Sheen are among those who make token appearances throughout the film. Many have said that 'Being John Malkovich' is a film that will mean more in the future. I am not sure about this. I doubt that it will be as trail-blazing as say '2001: A Space Odyssey'. This is a unique experience that is a curiosity. The fact that it will have so many tireless imitations will not help its case either. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,9,19,4 August 2001

Immediately now his three friends (I guess you can call them that) are doing everything in their power to get Carell to have sex for the first time. There are loose women abound in wild clubs, the super-kinky Elizabeth Banks (arguably the best performer in a sexually-charged role) in a nearby bookstore and single mom Catherine Keener who works at an EBay specialty shop. Carell quickly likes Keener, while his pals give him loads of advice (mostly awful) as a thin line develops between having a sexual relationship and just having a meaningful relationship. Super raunchy, disgusting, verbally graphic antics all the way, but still strangely a film that has loads of emotion and heart. The characters all have a list of quirks, but ultimately they are likable and totally believable. Like 'Wedding Crashers' there is really not much of a brain to be found within, but I liked the final product anyway. Carell and Keener have a subtle chemistry that works. The friends (led by Rudd) are comedic tidal waves and Banks continues to be one of Hollywood's best kept secrets. Over-achieving adult-oriented comedy that is a little too heavy for youngsters, but an admittedly hilarious film for those of mature ages. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,7,5 September 2005

The purpose in doing this is to learn where a bomb is by going undercover in a maximum-security prison and getting the information from Cage's brother.  When Cage's character comes out of his coma, he decides to take Travolta's face.  Still with me?  In short Travolta's FBI agent is now Cage's crazed criminal and vise versa.

Talk about your mid-life crises. Can be looked upon as creative or down-right plagiarist, but overall an adequate continuation of the long-running series as 'Shrek Forever After' matches the little intensity left by 'Shrek the Third', but the first two of the series seem like distant memories now. The voice characterizations are still right on the money and the sight gags and one-liners are still strong enough to endear the film to even the harshest of legitimate critics. However, in the end many may wonder if this is the last theatrical gasp for our friend Shrek though. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,0,6 July 2011

Slick looking film benefits from outstanding cinematography and a strong soundtrack, but overall the screenplay is not near as clever as it would lead you to believe. Foxx shows real range with a potentially flat role and Cruise is solid in an enigmatic part. Michael Mann's direction keeps the product flowing like liquid mercury until the somewhat ridiculous final act where too many coincidences and wild outcomes show the film's pretentious nature. With a slew of problems evident, I still found 'Collateral' a small success because of its two leads. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,28 January 2005

","A rodent in Paris dreams of becoming a chef and actually gets the chance in a high-class restaurant when he crosses paths with a helpless cook. Arguably the weakest film of its type from the Pixar Studios as 'Ratatouille' struggles with an uneven story, poor pacing, uninteresting characters, and by-the-numbers techniques. The animation is still as strong as ever, the rats have their moments, but the cartoonish people are as dull and unwanted as 1980s yuppies trying to make their millions so they could retire at 40. With a whole list of criticisms, I still gave the film a marginal recommendation for its state of the art animation and for the fact this summer has been dying for a few critical winners. A film with rats running rampant all over streets and kitchens is definitely not a turn-on though. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,12,25 July 2007

","Raunchy, disgusting, and stomach-churning mess has teacher Cameron Diaz doing seemingly anything and everything to be the worst teacher in the history of mankind in a junior high school. She is a superficial air-head who dreams of making just enough money for breast enhancement so she can get substitute teacher Justin Timberlake to notice her and ultimately marry him. It seems Timberlake's family has a fortune based on owning one of the world's most famous wristwatch companies (yawn). The antagonist here is fellow instructor Lucy Punch who seems more suited to a kindergarten class than a junior high school with sickening antics which seem to belittle and annoy everyone in sight. Also along for the ride is crude gym teacher Jason Segel who is not much of a better employee than Diaz and seems to have a crush on her. I guess it is true that birds of a feather will always flock together. 'Bad Teacher' starts off fairly enough, but the routine drops off the cliff quickly. Basically there is about enough material for a five-minute 'Saturday Night Live' sketch here and nothing more. As the minutes tick away, the misery becomes nearly unbearable.

Aliens," The Best of the 'Alien' Series
","As good as the original is, 'Aliens' is still the best of the popular series.  James Cameron's in-your-face direction creates edge-of-your-seat chills and thrills that will leave you shaken well after the film's final act.  Sigourney Weaver (Oscar-nominated) does some of the best work of her career.  This is definitely her show as she adds a new dimension to the film.  A group of space marines are assembled to find out what has happened on planet LV-426 (the planet from the original) after Earth loses contact with its inhabitants.  Weaver knows what has happened and warns the group of soldiers.  However, it takes an all-out assault by the title characters to convince the remainder of the crew that they are against an unbeatable foe. The screenplay is just smart enough to work and the supporting characters are great as well.  Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, Michael Biehn, and Bill Paxton stand out the most among the rest of the cast.

","Completely empty and annoying flick made primarily for teenage boys and men who never totally grow up. 'The Fast and the Furious' is a headache waiting to happen as undercover cop Paul Walker starts to rub shoulders with a Los Angeles street gang led by Vin Diesel (who has about as much acting ability as a cardboard cut-out). Diesel and his gang (which includes younger sister Jordana Brewster and girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez) are road pirates who hijack trucks in California and Arizona. They go after electronics equipment that they can sell to other street gangs around the city. So many missed opportunities hurt 'The Fast and the Furious'. There is a possible bond between Diesel and Walker ala that of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino in 'Heat', but that never does get much time because the film-makers are too busy showing off hot cars and hotter women. The movie is totally void of intelligence and its heart is as black as tar. As loud and as flashy as the production makes itself out to be, it is still amazing that in the end 'The Fast the Furious' is really a somewhat boring experience. Rapper Ja Rule does the music here and makes a short cameo as a street racer who has the need for speed. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,11 July 2003
The Exorcist," Amazing Achievement and Probably the Most Under-Rated Movie of All Time
","'The Exorcist' was a smash hit both critically and financially in 1973, but many complain that its effect is not as potent today as it was nearly 30 years ago.  I disagree with this opinion and feel that the film gets better and more complicated with age.  The film deals with a young girl (Linda Blair in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is possessed by someone or something unholy.  Enter young priest Jason Miller (also Oscar-nominated) who tries to convince Blair's mother (Ellen Burstyn also Oscar-nominated) that her problems are merely psychological and not supernatural.  However, Miller slowly begins to realize that there is something wrong with Blair that cannot be explained with psychology.  A key sub-plot is Miller's own inner-demons.  He is a man who has lost his faith and due to this fact is slowly descending into an abyss of emptiness.  The mysterious exorcist, played by Max Von Sydow is the only known individual who can free Blair from her personal prison.  Needless to say 'The Exorcist' appears to be an example of a 'sure-thing' at the box office.  The film was directed by William Friedkin who was the equivalent of Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese at the time of this film's release because of his work on 'The French Connection' just two years earlier in 1971.  Of course the film was a sure thing financially, even though it appeared that the movie would sit in a Warner Bros. vault due to its questionable material.  The film is still a shocker that has never lost its luster to me.  Many of the images shown in this film would have trouble being approved today by the Motion Picture Association of America.  William Peter Blatty's screenplay, based on his equally potent novel, is one of the most impressive in the history of film. Friedkin's direction is flawless and Jason Miller gives one of the most complicated performances the cinema has ever experienced.  This is a film which is much deeper than it appears on the surface, the questions and concerns that it raises make it one of the best films of the 1970s and probably the most under-rated film of all time.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,5,25 July 2000
Gandhi," Old-Time Hollywood Epic Redux.
","The life of the legendary man from India (dominant Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley, who was a total unknown theatrical newcomer at the time) who gave up work as an attorney to defy British rule throughout the first half of the 20th Century before falling to an assassin's bullet in 1948. Long, opulent, breath-taking and completely memorable take on one of the most important historical figures the world has ever known. Oscar-winning director Richard Attenborough obviously studied David Lean's epic film-making masterpieces from the 1950s and 1960s as we have similarities galore with 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' and much more importantly 'Lawrence of Arabia'. An all-star cast of very old-time Hollywood legends (John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, John Mills) and relative newcomers who were on the rise (Candice Bergen, Martin Sheen, Edward Fox, Nigel Hawthorne and a super quick glance of a very young Daniel Day-Lewis) blend in a desert landscape of cinematic brilliance. Make no mistake of it though, 'Gandhi' works because of Kingsley as he weaves a colorful tapestry of cinematic performing ungodliness with a totally convincing take on his role and the complex subject matter. Running nearly 190 minutes, 'Gandhi' still just uses flash-points to under-score the importance and significance of the major topics within. Those familiar with advanced world history will likely get more out of the film, but still a movie whose glitter continues to shine as bright as ever. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,66,82,24 September 2005
American History X," One of the Most Important Films of the 1990s, Should Be Required Viewing
","'American History X' was overlooked in 1998, but was probably the best film of the year, with the exception of 'The Thin Red Line'.  The film deals with a young man (Edward Norton in an Oscar-nominated performance) who goes over the edge when his fire-fighting father is killed trying to put out a blaze in a crack-house in an African-American neighborhood.  Now Norton becomes a neo-Nazi skinhead who falls in with an evil businessman (Stacey Keach). After Norton kills two African-Americans who are trying to steal his truck, he gets sentenced to a prison term which is much shorter than it should have been.  On the outside, his younger brother (Edward Furlong) is becoming the same type of evil person that Norton is.  When Norton gets out of prison, he shows that he has had a change of heart and realizes that hate is wrong. After Furlong realizes that Norton has truly changed, he wants to know what happened to Norton during his prison stay.  Norton tells his story in flashbacks which are shown in black-and-white.  We see Norton being cut down to size while he's in prison.  He is betrayed by those same type of people that he thought he supported and befriends a young African-American inmate. When Norton learns that his new friend is in prison for an even longer stretch than him for a somewhat minor crime (trying to steal a television), Norton realizes that the system that he hates so much is really more fair to him than minorities.  Norton's story touches Furlong and they abandon a lifestyle which has almost destroyed their lives.  However, there are enemies lurking in the shadows (Keach's neo-Nazis and local African-Americans) and revenge against Norton and his family may be a real possibility in the end.  'American History X' is an unflinching film which is very difficult to sit through, but is well-worth one's time.  The screenplay is excellent and the editing techniques are surprisingly impressive as well (cutting from vivid color to black-and-white sequences). Director and cinematographer Tony Kaye was disgusted at the final-cut of this film and went public beforehand to acknowledge that the final product was not his vision.  This testimonial created controversy and stole much of the film's thunder when it was first released; this was really unfortunate. The greatest thing that makes 'American History X' work are the players. Edward Norton is excellent, as usual.  Edward Furlong shows amazing range as well.  Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, and Stacey Keach all do the best work of their careers as well.  An amazing accomplishment and one of those films that should be required viewing to all young people.  Probably the most under-rated film of the 1990s.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,7,19 September 2000

Spirited Away," Too Many Fundamentals Got 'Spirited Away' Here.
","The Best Animated Feature Oscar winner of 2002 is an odd cinematic product that makes very little sense and seems interminable at times (running approximately 125 minutes total). The film comes from Asian writer/director Hayao Miyazaki, a noted animator who has been in the medium for over 30 years. 'Spirited Away' concerns a young girl who is moving with her parents to a new home, but a detour along the way forces the youth to grow up quicker than expected. An old abandoned theme park is discovered and soon her parents have turned into pigs and she is forced into a mystical world of large frogs and other strange creatures. Now she must find a way to get her parents back to their human forms and return to her rightful place in the world. Overall the animation goes beyond the Toonami realm and is technologically impressive. Also the musical score is reminiscent of that from 'The Last Emperor' and it gives the film an added dimension that it desperately needed. The look and sound of the movie definitely save the day as the story is a pure mess.

","Oh gosh a pure disaster of a film that is to the 2000s what 'Dune' was to the 1980s and 'Wyatt Earp' was to the 1990s. A totally disappointing would-be masterpiece that never does find its way and bores with a sappy love story more than it intrigues with a loud and empty action sequence that is interminable. It is 1941 and the U.S. is on dangerous ground as the attack on Pearl Harbor looms as Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale fall in love, but when it appears that Affleck is dead, Beckinsale starts to fall in love with his best friend (Josh Hartnett). A torrid love triangle gets in the way of the tenseness that made 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' such an interesting, albeit under-achieving, production. The attack comes, oh does it ever come, and Pearl Harbor is left in shambles. So now Affleck and Hartnett must put their differences aside when the U.S. couter-attacks in the almost unknown Dolittle Raid (which is not written about much because it too was such a disaster for the U.S. military). A long and sometimes incredibly dull film that does best when Cuba Gooding, Jr. is on screen. He co-stars as an African-American sailor who tries to earn respect from his contemporaries in a military that is fueled by racial unrest. Gooding, Jr.'s character is based on a real person who actually shot down several Japanese attack planes and was awarded a medal that was later taken back by the government.

Actors Ben Stiller (also co-writer/director), Robert Downey, Jr., Jack Black, and others get thrown together in a would-be epic Vietnam flick, but their prima-donna ways lead to issues abound for their first time British director (Steve Coogan), their war veteran screenwriter (Nick Nolte), and a crazed movie mogul (an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise as he is totally unbound) who funds the entire production. Thus the actors get thrown into an East Asian hotbed of international heroin production where the enemy has the tale-tell signs of 1970s Vietnam. Another one of those big budget summer would-be blockbusters which shows all its good points in the movie spots and cinematic trailers. The movie ends up being a long and tiring exercise accentuated by foul-mouthed characters and chaotic set pieces. Downey, Jr.'s transformation into an African-American is weird to say the least and Black's hidden narcotic addiction is supposed to be a funny side-story which ends up being annoying and completely unwanted.

What a feeling! 'Flashdance' is pretty tame by director Adrian Lyne's standards (think '9 1/2 Weeks', 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Unfaithful'). This fact does not really benefit or take away from the picture though. The characters are likable, but seem so phony and under-developed. For a time though every girl of the age wore those shirts that hung off one shoulder and every man wanted to be cool like Nouri and be with a hot woman like Beals (ah, the 80s). And of course naturally everyone had to have that soundtrack (which of course was highlighted by 'What a Feeling'---the runaway Best Original Song Oscar winner for 1983).

","'Independence Day' earned more money than any other film in 1996.  In the film, aliens from an unknown planet hover over major parts of the world and finally attack.  Almost everything is destroyed and the few survivors who remain band together to fight the un-welcomed visitors.  Needless to say the special effects and technical aspects of the film are pretty solid, but that does not save the film from being a major disappointment.  The direction and screenplay are near non-existent and the characters are woefully flat and uninteresting.  All in all a poor film that is nothing more than a lot of noise.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,3,8,26 July 2000

Gone with the Wind," The Film That Changed Hollywood Forever
","Arguably the greatest and most beloved movie of all time, 'Gone With the Wind' is cinematic magic at its finest.  The film is about Scarlett O'Hara's (Vivien Leigh, in an Oscar-winning role) experiences, in the South, during our country's Civil War.  We see the triumphs and tribulations of this amazing character through some of our nation's darkest years.  The screenplay, based on the popular novel, is super.  Victor Fleming received an Oscar for his direction, but there were rumored to be as many as 12 directors who collaborated on the final product.  Clark Gable (Oscar-nominated) gives the performance of a lifetime and the fact that he failed to win the Oscar is one of life's true mysteries.  Hattie McDaniel did win in the supporting actress category (she was the first African-American to win an Oscar).  Her win cost Olivia de Havilland, who also received a nomination in that group.  In all the film won eight competitive Oscars and two special achievement awards.  It was nominated for 13 overall, an unheard of number for Oscar in 1939.  'Gone With the Wind' is one of those films that set the mark for excellence in film-making.  In over 60 years there are maybe five films, at the most, who have matched or bettered 'Gone With the Wind'.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,4,7,28 October 2000
Alien vs. Predator," Looking Forward to Tylenol vs. Advil.
","The enormous commercial success of 'Freddy vs. Jason' (one of the worst mainstream films of recent memory) made 'Alien vs. Predator' a cinematic reality. What can you say? The movie is not much when you put it on celluloid. It is a dark and bleak mesh of two ideas that wore their welcomes out long ago. A team of scientists led by Sanaa Lathan and corporate bigwig Lance Henriksen (playing a different role from earlier 'Alien' pictures) go to Antarctica of all places to drill hundreds of feet beneath the frozen ground to explore a pyramid that time seemingly forgot. Naturally predators built the structure centuries earlier and we get a strange combination of Egyptology and other ancient civilizations. Also predators have been the universe's greatest warriors and they have proven their worth in their field by hunting---you guessed it, the aliens. How are humans involved? They have been used to breed the alien creatures for future hunts. Ridiculous territory does not get helped out by awful cinematography and art direction that is hard to even recognize. The performers are just window-dressing to present the two groups of entities in would-be-frightening form. This is officially the fifth time that an 'Alien' film has been produced and the third time for the 'Predator' series. Each series (particularly 'Alien') started out very strong, but now we are left with a lack of storyline material and thus we have an uninteresting mixture that has no business combining. Probably the worst film for each series. Still a bit better than 'Freddy vs. Jason', but really what film isn't? 2 stars out of 5.",Null,0,3,10 September 2004
Days of Thunder," The Wheels on the Race-Car Go Round and Round, Round and Round, Round and Round.
","The world of car-racing has never been too exciting to me. It is a sport that just seems kind of dumb as cars run around in circles for hours on end. Fans of the sport are fanatics though and look at the contests as spiritual events. While 'Days of Thunder' never did change my views of competitive auto-racing, I still found this movie to be surprisingly impressive. An adrenaline rush that makes something that is very dull to me be very intriguing. However with that said, 'Days of Thunder' succeeds because of its characters and their relationships with one another and not its mind-blowing cinematography and editing during the race sequences. Tom Cruise literally comes out of nowhere one day and claims that there is nothing he cannot do with a race-car. Of course old-time crew chief Robert Duvall (making a perfect appearance as usual) soon realizes that the cocky Cruise is an out-of-this-world driver, but also discovers that the youngster really has a minimal knowledge of anything that has to do with cars other than driving. Soon they create a father-son bond that propels them to legitimacy in the race world. A terrible accident early on though leads Cruise to meet neurologist Nicole Kidman and romance blossoms very quickly. Cruise's hot temper though creates trouble with sponsors (Randy Quaid), NASCAR officials (Fred Dalton Thompson) and even fellow competitors (most notably Michael Rooker and Cary Elwes). As the film progresses it is made quite clear that Cruise, a man who seemed to not need anyone early on, needs Kidman and Duvall in his life. Tom Cruise come up with this story with legendary screenwriter Robert Towne (most notable for his work on 'Chinatown' and he even wrote a portion of 'The Godfather', going uncredited, as well). Towne handled the actual screen-writing duties by himself and does a completely under-rated job here. This movie has always been shunned by most critics and the general public. However, the old 'Formula One' way of making a movie is more than adequate here. The chemistry on the silver screen between Cruise and Kidman cannot be denied and Duvall's ability to be so natural and wise in productions like this make him a very impressive asset. Definitely flawed, 'Days of Thunder' still comes out winning the checkered flag. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,10,16,8 October 2003

Batman Begins," Bats All Over the Belfrey.
","Dark, disturbing and demoralizing take on the 'Batman' series as director Christopher Nolan (best known for 'Memento' and 'Insomnia') resurrects a series that seemingly limped away in 1997. The title says it all as we get a prequel to the four new age installments that started in 1989. Bruce Wayne (the very moody Christian Bale) has been an international recluse after his parents were killed in a botched robbery while he was a youngster. He finds himself in Asia of all places and in trouble with police authorities. Soon Bale is being taught the ways of revenge and vengeance with the help of a very shady ninja cult led by Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe. Meanwhile, things are chaotic and crazed in a bleak Gotham City as childhood friend/current assistant district attorney Katie Holmes appears to be the only beacon of light. A ruthless crime boss (Tom Wilkinson) and a demented psycho-analyst (the excellent Cillian Murphy) are the key characters in an exact landscape spinning out of control. Bale's return to the city sends shock-waves to Holmes and Rutger Hauer (who is running Bale's rightful business affairs). Also along for the ride are butler Michael Caine and exiled technological genius Morgan Freeman who assist Bale as he starts his transformation to his alter ego. Seemingly only one good cop (Gary Oldman) within the city is also featured in the dizzying mix. Graphically violent and pitch black take on the material as we have social and psychological commentaries that mesh with layering story lines of complex characters, intense situations and a demented would-be outcome that involves biblical undertones and even military germ warfare. With all the difficulty and depth that 'Batman Begins' has, it still does not necessarily set itself apart from the better superhero films produced. No doubt, Nolan's vision is likely the finest product of the five in the series ('Batman' from 1989 would be the only other in the group that could compete) but we might almost get too much data as the film leaves a lot to swallow as the numerous characters and background end up getting in the way of confusing action sequences and schizophrenic pacing. Though far from perfect, I think that 'Batman Begins' stands very tall within its genre and represents a real highlight for the cinema in 2005. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,4,16 June 2005

","'Meet the Fockers' is easy to critique. Just go back and watch 'Meet the Parents', change the location, add two Hollywood legends doing perhaps the worst work of their careers and you have this smelly mess of a movie. The standard crew from the first installment (the engaged Ben Stiller and Teri Polo and Polo's parents Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) take to the road in a massively large recreational vehicle to meet Stiller's parents (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand). The typical problems then take place as the friction we felt in the original between Stiller and De Niro is compounded by the friction between De Niro and Stiller's parents. 'Meet the Fockers' is too long and dumb to be endearing. The routine of the first installment became tiring long before this stinker was ever dreamed up. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,4,13 January 2005

'The Princess Bride' is a fantastical mess that is so short on direction, characterization, script and technology that it tries to win its audience over with confusion and incoherence. Obviously many have taken the bait wholeheartedly. An elderly man (Peter Falk) reads a fairy tale to his brat of a grandson (the always terrible Fred Savage). In the tale, our hero Cary Elwes tries to rescue the beautiful maiden (Robin Wright) from all sorts of bad guys (led primarily by Chris Sarandon) with whacked results. Cameos abound, dated visual effects and a script that combines every cliché from the genre make 'The Princess Bride' one of those pictures you should ignore, in spite of what the overwhelming majority of the general public thinks. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,3,13,17 September 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Along With 'Schindler's List', Spielberg's Best
","Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' is one of the those films that is a pure cinematic masterpiece.  It's gritty, realistic, and well-made in every possible department.  The film captured five Oscars and probably should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998.  Some things about the film that really stick out are the cinematography (where approximately 60% of the color was faded from each frame), the editing, and of course Spielberg's direction. I'm not sure any other director working today could have done as well as Spielberg did on this picture.  Tom Hanks is also excellent.  He is one of those rare actors who can dominate a film without dominating it (in other words he's always there, but he makes the supporting actors better).  In many ways this may have been his best acting job ever.  All in all 'Saving Private Ryan' is easily one of the top 10 or 15 films of the 1990s.  It's a film that will be remembered for decades to come.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,7,13,24 June 2000
The Pianist," Five Not So Easy Pieces.
","Haunting adaptation based on the life of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by surprise Oscar-winner Adrien Brody), a somewhat sheltered young man who just takes life as it comes to him and of course has an uncanny knack for playing the piano. Timing is bad though for the titled character as the Nazi occupation of Poland is imminent and exile to death camps is a definite possibility. Brody and his family (parents Maureen Lipman and Frank Finley and siblings Ed Stoppard, Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) quickly realize that things are going from bad to worse as life starts to spin out of control. Instructions in the newspaper foreshadow future hardships as the Star of David patches are demanded of all Jewish peoples to wear and then the dreaded ghettos follow. The film then becomes heart-wrenching, but a change occurs that allows Brody to be spared from the death camps. Now he must try to avoid the Nazi Regime and find an unbending will to survive against all odds. Help does come from fellow Jews and non-Nazi Germans. Emilia Fox makes a lasting impression as a woman that Brody falls in love with early on and then shows up again later in an important part. Thomas Kretschmann also stands out as a Nazi officer who has a change of heart during the film's latter moments (he is also linked to Brody because of his love for the piano). 'The Pianist' is a film that fashions itself after Spielberg's 'Schindler's List'. This production is better in spots than the earlier movie, but as a whole it is not quite as impressive. 'The Pianist' has a more exact focus and ends up being more of a one-man showcase for Brody in its second half. 'Cast Away' meets the Holocaust would probably be the way to describe 'The Pianist' when all is said and done. A brilliant adapted screenplay by Oscar-winner Ronald Harwood brings the novel to life. Roman Polanski finally struck Oscar gold for his unbelievable direction here (his work is on par with Scorsese's in 'Gangs of New York' for the most part). He quietly became the oldest winner ever in the Academy's history in that particular category. All the supporters have well-calculated parts, but Brody's character is the most dominant of course. However, Brody never does reach the level of Liam Neeson in 'Schindler's List' or even past Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni in 'Life Is Beautiful'. In fact his character is not near as complicated as the film would like. He is trying to survive and his motivation is life. A case can be made quite easily for either Daniel Day-Lewis in 'Gangs of New York' or Jack Nicholson in 'About Schmidt' to have taken home the Best Actor Oscar instead, but that is in the past now (it is better not to go into Brody's acceptance speech at all). Also Brody did very little playing of the piano himself (he had a double for the much more difficult pieces) which pales him to past Oscar winners like Holly Hunter ('The Piano') and Geoffrey Rush ('Shine'). Overall I do think 'The Pianist' is an excellent film. I do think it is one of the stronger screenplay- and direction-driven films of recent memory. Polanski ends up being the real star here and it is his vision, tone, ability and film-making skill that does make 'The Pianist' one of the best movies of 2002. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,5,10,11 April 2003
Seabiscuit," People and Horses and Minutes, Oh My.
","The larger-than-life titled racehorse gets the royal treatment in this would-be-masterpiece from director Gary Ross (who had an electric debut with 'Pleasantville' back in 1998). 'Seabiscuit' is one of those long and sometimes nearly excruciating exercises that ultimately ends up trying to do too much to be a complete success. It is the Depression-era in the United States and the country is literally staggering to survive economically and personally. A youngster (the character grows to be Tobey Maguire) leaves his family so he can work with horses and eventually becomes a jockey that struggles with his weight and the emotional losses he has suffered. Old, washed-up horse trainer Chris Cooper becomes little more than a vagrant as the Depression hits and tries to keep his sanity by working with the animals he loves. Self-made man Jeff Bridges does not get hurt economically, but loses his only son in a freak accident and sinks into a personal depression as his wife leaves him as well. Soon though all three men will be brought together via an old horse that has never been nurtured and treated the way he should have been. What follows is a long and emotional journey for the major players as they all attempt to turn their lives around with the help of the famed horse. Bridges finds love again with a much younger beauty (Elizabeth Banks) and one of Maguire's rivals (Gary Stevens) also becomes a prominent figure as the film hits its climax. In the 1930s the press (sleazy radio personality William H. Macy in particular) had a field day with the horse, making comparisons between the animal and the way that most in the country had also fought back from hardships. 'Seabiscuit' is one of those near misses. It is a would-be dramatic powerhouse that loses its way with an annoying narration, a climax that comes way too early (a syndrome with Hollywood products these days) and unsteady direction by Ross. The screenplay (also by Ross) goes too much for forced comedy and that gets in the way of its dramatic momentum. Bridges and Cooper are very solid, but Maguire disappoints here. There are several performers who would have been better suited for his role really. I still liked the movie in spite of numerous problems, but it is not near as impressive as the film-makers had hoped it would be. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,4,8,25 August 2003
28 Days Later...," Days of the Living Dead and the Dead Ideas.
","'Night of the Living Dead'-styled hybrid about a deadly, incurable virus that spreads like wildfire through the United Kingdom over a month's time and turns its victims into dangerous monsters. By the end of that month the central character (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma and finds that most all of London has been deserted. He finds very few survivors (Naomie Harris, Megan Burns and Brendan Gleeson, the latter's father) and together they embark on a seemingly impossible trek to survive. As time passes they actually find a few more survivors (military soldiers led by the mysterious Christopher Eccleston), but that development does not necessarily ensure the small group's safety. '28 Days Later...' starts off very well, but then spins out of control when Murphy actually begins to discover that he is not the only one left alive in his homeland. Gleeson is the only interesting character, but he is not around enough to lift a film that is already starting to go down the drain by the time he appears. The movie just feels very strange to put it mildly. Its editing, cinematography and even its music (its score is copied from recent masterpieces 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Traffic') mix and mesh to complete a potentially interesting, but ultimately mediocre film-making effort. 2 stars out of 5.",Null,2,7,23 July 2004
Lawrence of Arabia," Makes a Strong Case for Best Film Ever.
","The definitive epic of the cinema's history. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is hands-down the finest production of the 1960s and makes a strong case as the best movie ever made. The titled character (Oscar-nominee Peter O'Toole in his career-defining role) dies in a freak motorcycle accident in the early-1930s in his homeland of England. In spite of being honored by the nation, many knew nothing of him. Some loved him, others despised him, but no one seemed to know the man at all. Flashbacks immediately start as we meet the character during World War I. He is a lieutenant assigned to mundane duties, but suddenly he is thrust into a greater role in North Africa. He is to assist a Saudi Arabian prince (Alec Guinness). The goal is to fight off the dreaded Turkish regime that poses a threat to the Arabs. If the Turks take over this land in Africa, what will it mean for the English? This concern leads to those in charge (most notably Claude Rains) wanting the titled character to help the Arabs to win their freedom back from the Turks. With the help of allies Omar Sharif (Oscar-nominated) and Anthony Quinn, among a whole host of others, O'Toole starts to assist the Arabs in their all-or-nothing task. An ambitious American journalist (Arthur Kennedy) wants to tell O'Toole's story in the hopes of getting the U.S. interested in the war (basically trying to get his nation involved in World War I by presenting them with a larger-than-life hero). During the venture O'Toole becomes a bit war-crazed and looks at himself as a sort of Christ-like figure who thinks of himself as immortal. O'Toole proves to be someone who is very at home in combat and when the combat is over, will he be able to function properly? Franklin J. Schaffner's 'Patton' benefited greatly from David Lean's (Oscar-winning for directing) masterpiece. This Best Picture Oscar winner from 1962 just grows in importance as the years pass by. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a thinking person's film that is much, much deeper than it appears on the surface (and it appears deep on the surface to start with). The film deals with a slice of history that really did not seem that important back during World War I, but the situations in the Middle East now are greatly due to T.E. Lawrence's acts nearly a century ago. Did leading the Arabs to freedom make the world a safer place? This is the main question that Lean's film raises. Guinness' character is someone who changes almost immediately near the end of the production and it is a somewhat frightening foreshadower of things to come. A monumental milestone in film-making that stands so tall against all the other great productions of all eras. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,158,211,6 August 2002

City of God," A Heavy Cloud Over Heaven.
","A popular surge swept the land just prior to the 2003 Oscars and 'City of God' became a critical success with the Academy. The popularity is somewhat misleading though as this production has tons of problems with its Oscar-nominated script and uneven performances across the board. The setting early is 1960s Rio de Janeiro. A ghetto just outside the city limits is the breeding ground for dangerous gangs of thugs who are little more than adolescents who go around and create chaotic violence. One of these youngsters grows to become Leandro Firmino, a heartless miscreant who toes the line between just being cruel and being down-right psychotic. He is kept somewhat under control by his top assistant Phellipe Haagensen, but in their world both are in as much danger as those that come into contact with them. As all this goes on another youngster (who grows to become Alexandre Rodrigues) from the same neighborhood looks to take a different route completely by trying to become a photographer. Rodrigues, like his contemporaries, also has a life that seems to be on a tight time table. The picture advances to the 1980s and the ultimate fates of the primary characters come shining through in vivid and ironic fashions. Directors Fernando Meirelles (Oscar-nominated in the category) and Katia Lund develop a technologically interesting picture that benefits greatly from landmark cinematography by Oscar-nominee Cesar Charlone and highly difficult editing techniques by Daniel Rezende (also Oscar-nominated). The camera-work is enough to give this film a high mark, but once again the performers are not as good as advertised and the script by Oscar-nominee Braulio Mantovani is unsteady and a bit pretentious. The fact that the tale is based on fact does not really give the picture any more credibility than it would have if it had been from the mind of a foreign screenwriter. The characters are not always believable and are usually not worth caring about. Many problems, but still a noble and overall intriguing product. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,5,9,17 September 2004

","Absolutely wonderful animated feature that is arguably the finest of its type. In a world of human-like automobiles, one is at the threshold of super-stardom via his amazing racing skills. However he is brash, selfish and ignorant of others around him. It takes a crazed twist of fate to forever change him as he gets stuck in a small town just off the interstate and is forced to repair a street after unwittingly tearing it up. There he learns that sometimes the best thing to do is to slow down and enjoy the show that is life as he meets others who have been demoralized due to technologies and innovations that have all but killed their sleepy little community.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," 'Crouching Performances, Hidden Screenplay' Would Be More Accurate
","Perhaps one of the most deceiving and over-rated films of the past decade would have to be the somewhat obscure 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. The film is a part-fantasy and part-adventure about two warriors in feudal Asia (Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) who must try to recover a magical sword that has been stolen and attempt to stop a dangerous female fugitive who has been a thorn in their sides for years. While the two definitely have feelings for each other, they are bound by several factors that they cannot overcome. Relative new-comer Ziyi Zhang is the thief of the sword and also a daughter of a well-to-do aristocrat. She is a young lady who does not know what she wants in life, but knows that she does not want to be married, something she is being forced to do. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', much like the equally over-rated 'Gladiator' was a smash-hit in 2000. It became one of, if the not the most, successful foreign-language films in the history of films. It captured four Oscars after a whopping 10 nominations and was a real threat the whole way to win the Best Picture Oscar. Critics hailed this film from every direction and most of the mainstream audience has been enthralled by it. However, the film has so many shortcomings that it is destined to be little more than a curiosity in the future. The performances are all weak except for the young Ziyi Zhang. She is the only intriguing character and although she has a very large part, she probably should have had even more time on the screen. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are basically stunt actors that are physically impressive, but are below-average performers and it shows even more in an ambitious film like this. The small details are impressive and Ang Lee does a good job with the direction, but his job with this film is over-rated as well. Many were blown away with the fight scenes and special effects, but many Asian films from the 1950s and 1960s did the same thing with much more limited resources. In fact some of those films are more realistic looking than this film in that regard. These problems hurt 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', but what I really disliked about the film was the blundering screenplay that never did know where it wanted to go. So many side-stories and ridiculous situations make the script seem like it was just thrown together in an opium-induced state by the original novelist. Many camps developed in 2000. Some cheered for 'Gladiator' some for 'Traffic' and some for 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. While 'Gladitor' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' are not bad films, their enormous success does not compare with the cinematic brilliance of 'Traffic'. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a truly deceptive film. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,4 August 2001

The cast, led by Kevin Costner and the Oscar-nominated Tommy Lee Jones is second-to-none, and Stone's direction is just as powerful as his previous work in 'Platoon' and 'Born on the Fourth of July'.  The film deals with Stone's conspiracy theory that President Kennedy's assassination was part of a powerful cover-up that went through the highest places in our government. Is Stone's reasoning warranted?  I am not sure.  The JFK case has been a major mystery ever sense it occurred some 37 years ago.  Perhaps it was just a simple assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald, but the increasing speculation and paranoia makes even the most skeptical theorists stand up and take notice to this story.

The film picks up immediately where 'The Fellowship of the Ring' left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto).

Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment ('The Return of the King'). Many view 'The Two Towers' as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,19,21,25 March 2003
Schindler's List," Quite Possibly the Best and Most Important Film of the 1990s
","Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' is a top-notch film in every sense. The production values are extremely high, the cinematography (shot almost completely in black and white) is a sight to behold, the original score is amazing, the screenplay is complicated and unrelenting, and the performances are some of the best ever from any film ever produced.  However, it is Spielberg's direction that makes 'Schindler's List' the instant classic that it is.  The film deals with a businessman (Liam Neeson in an Oscar-nominated role) who looks to profit from World War II by producing war goods for the Nazi Army and employing ghetto Jews as cheap labor.  Ben Kingsley plays a Jewish accountant who acts as Schindler's right-hand man who makes sure that he gets as many Jews as he can to save them from imminent deaths at Nazi war camps.  When Schindler witnesses what is really going on he has a change of heart and starts to save the Jews of Poland by buying them from a sadistic Nazi commander (Ralph Fiennes in an Oscar-nominated role).  Needless to say, Schindler develops the 'list' with Kingsley and over 1,000 Jews were saved from certain deaths at the hands of the Nazi army.  'Schindler's List' is one of those utterly brilliant films that are rarely made today, or at any time for that matter.  This is also one of the most important films ever made.  When this film was initially released in 1993 some doubted the Holocaust had ever actually happened.  Many professors from prominent universities were convincing young people that the Holocaust was a fictional tool of propaganda used by the Allied Powers to create support for their cause.  Of course this is ridiculous, but many people were believing this trite.  That is the primary reason why this film is such an amazing success. Spielberg had an urge to do this project way back in the early-1980s, but did not feel he was quite ready for the harsh material (he was probably right in waiting).  He offered the project to Martin Scorsese (who also did not feel comfortable with the material) and even Stanley Kubrick (he was not interested).  Billy Wilder, well in his 80s at the time, also showed considerable interest.  However, Spielberg bought his time and went forward when he finally felt the time was right.  The timing was perfect and this film is perfect.  Easily one of the top 10 films of all time.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,9,14,27 June 2000
The Incredibles," Semi-Fantastic Four.
","Superheroes have to go into hiding ala the witness protection program after civilians start to take advantage by suing the gifted ones in crazed lawsuits. Now all superheroes must live as their alter egos in a world where having special powers is frowned upon all of a sudden. The patriarch of the titled family though becomes the target of a deviant individual who was once his biggest fan. Thus it is up to his family to save him so the group can save the world once more. 'The Incredibles' is strong with its animation, but honestly the story is hit-and-miss. Hanna and Barbara-styled ideas from the 1960s and 1970s mix with that dark comic book look that was so prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s to form a long (and I do mean long) cartoon that suffers an identity crisis with its tone and pace. The characters have their moments, but most are not as interesting as they look. Director Brad Bird has crafted a film that definitely has more upside than down because of its glossy look and hot visuals. However, I still think that a little more time could have been spent on the script and on the movie's potential uniqueness. Unfortunately, 'The Incredibles' really pales to most recent computer generated productions. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,7,13,15 November 2004
The Elephant Man," Hard to Critique.
","David Lynch's unorthodox direction (Oscar-nominated) and the highly dark black-and-white cinematography are the main attractions in this over-rated would-be-masterpiece. A circus freak with Proteus Syndrome (Oscar nominee John Hurt) is living a life that is much like a wild animal's, but in spite of his appearance he is a sensitive and very intelligent man. Victorian doctor Anthony Hopkins tries to save him from a life of misery. The film struggles for greatness and almost succeeds, but the movie's odd tone does not help its case in the end. Anne Bancroft and John Gielgud seem wasted in supporting roles. Good, but far from being excellent. Still one of Lynch's most interesting works. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,7,4 July 2002
Dog Day Afternoon," Another Five-Star Film From the 70s.
","Outstanding character-study that is unique, interesting, highly-unconventional and definitely brilliant in every way. Two dim-witted bank robbers (Oscar-nominated Al Pacino and the late John Cazale) decide to rob a New York City bank on a summer day in the early-1970s. The robbery is to be cut-and-dry, but nothing goes as planned. Instead of getting away with a load of money, there is only a miniscule amount as the money was transported away earlier in the day. As Pacino tries to burn bank records, a small fire is noticed outside the bank and total chaos ensues. Now the bank is surrounded by the police and the FBI. Charles Durning and James Broderick are among the officials outside the bank as they attempt to negotiate with Pacino to get the bank's employees out safely. It is learned that Pacino is involved in a homosexual relationship with Chris Sarandon (Oscar-nominated) and that his main goal was to steal his share of the money to get Sarandon a sex-change operation. The nervous Cazale is more worried that the media will think he is homosexual than anything else. The film is dark in many ways, very light-hearted and funny in other ways, but always dramatic and tense. As the clock ticks, the realization occurs that this will not end well for the robbers. Sidney Lumet's Oscar-nominated direction is sharp throughout. Based on actual events, 'Dog Day Afternoon' is another great winner from the 1970s, Hollywood's second Golden Age. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,26,33,14 March 2002
School of Rock," Ace and King Equal Black Jack........Or Is It Jack Black?
","Very suspicious guilty pleasure that seems to stumble around and succeed for the most part in spite of itself. Disillusioned small-time rocker Jack Black (a tornado of enthusiasm) is about to be tossed out of his apartment by roommate Mike White (who wrote the screenplay) and White's new girlfriend (the constantly annoying Sarah Silverman) for not paying his share of the rent. White, a substitute teacher, is called one day by prep school principal Joan Cusack to take over a class for an extended period of time. Of course Black, not White (How ironic is that?), is the one who answers the phone and he ends up posing as his best friend for some much needed cash. So now Black is way over his head in a class of children that all seem a bit more intelligent than he is. Black, who really knows nothing but rock music, convinces his class to create a band and enter a contest. Naturally his motives are to make money from the contest, become a star and show up his old band. But what happens when things get complicated for all involved? 'The School of Rock' is candy-coated dribble, but it has a beat and rhythm to it that I liked anyway. Black is the catalyst. He takes a simple, and honestly kind of mediocre, story and runs with the material as fast as he can. So much is done so fast that you find yourself doing your best to keep up with the enjoyable characters. Far from anything really extraordinary, but still a unique over-achiever nonetheless. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,30 October 2003

Also along for the ride, and basically stealing the show, is best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) who unwittingly gets mixed up with a British super-agent (Michael Caine ala an automobile version of James Bond's 007). Creatively executed, vividly-realized winner which overcomes possible old-hat routines to be one of the better films of its type. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,6 July 2011
Amadeus," Dominant Best Picture Winner of 1984
","'Amadeus' is a great film that is deep, thought-provoking, and overall exceptional.  The film deals with the last few months of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's (Oscar-nominee Tom Hulce) life, told in flashbacks by an old, washed-up musician named Antonio Salieri (Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham). Salieri tells of the genius, the ingenuity, and the insanity of the young musician who died mysteriously at the age of 35.  Salieri's jealousy may have led him to kill the young composer, but that is something that will never be known.  'Amadeus' is an interesting commentary that tries to fill holes in history and succeeds amazingly.

What follows is a fast-paced and hilarious thrill-ride of a movie that never does seem old or dated.

Hero," Heroism Comes in Many Different Forms.
","'Ying Xiong' (translated 'Hero') is an outstanding Oriental production by director Yimou Zhang that is everything 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' wanted to be and so much more. In ancient China (where there is a Civil War being fought among six different sections of the nation), just prior to the reign of the country's first emperor, a man (Jet Li) is summoned to the most powerful ruler's (Daoming Chen-King) private quarters after the man has apparently killed the ruler's most feared enemies (Tony Leung Chin Wai, Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi). What follows is a 'The Usual Suspects'-styled masterpiece where Li tells one story, then another, then another and so on until it is extremely difficult to learn what the true reality is. Each story is shown in stunning flashbacks where there are amazing martial arts sequences that are each unique in style, concept and cinematic execution. There are numerous combinations with the performers within the flashbacks as each of the key players seems to have air-time separately with one another. Thus we have a wonderfully layered picture where everyone has an equal role and each performer has the opportunity to have at least one character-defining scene. The movie is much deeper and emotional than it might appear on the surface as a love affair between Leung Chiu Wai and Cheung is a constant factor and more importantly the love that all the characters have toward their homeland (even though their loves are sometimes shown in various ways). Li does the best work of his career and Chen matches the intensity step for step. The others are all super as well. The movie has tons of upside as the cinematography, score, art direction, costume design and pacing are all right on target. Visually, this is an unbelievably beautiful work of art that uses old world techniques and new cinematic ideals to get its points across. Special thanks to Quentin Tarantino in bringing this movie to the U.S. mainstream. Not only one of the best films of the year, one of the best ever produced. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,27 October 2004

While not quite as good as the first two, 'Shrek the Third' delivers just what it promises: a good time at the movies. The animation and voice characterizations have always been the primary calling cards here. While the first 'Shrek' was way over-rated, this one is truly under-rated. The series never promised to be the computer-generated animation answer to 'Citizen Kane', but rather maybe the answer to something more in the line of the animated equivalent of 'Men in Black'. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,28 June 2007
No Man's Land," Sometimes a World Torn Apart.
","Shocking Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001 as this stole the Academy Award from the vastly popular French picture 'Amelie'. Excellent in most every way, 'No Man's Land' is from Bosnia-Herzegovina and tells the story of the most intense fighting over there between the Bosnians and the Serbians. In 1993 a group of Bosnians get ambushed one dark, cold and foggy night and it appears that the entire group is dead. That is not the case though. Two have actually survived. One (Filip Sovagovic) was knocked out so severely that he appeared dead and a Serbian has put a land mine underneath his thought-to-be deceased body. The other (Branko Dujuric) is hiding and trying to find a way out of the trench. Soon the two Bosnians and green-Serb Rene Bitorajac are caught together in the trench, right between the two battling armies. Death is almost certain for all three as Sovagonic cannot move from the mine and the other two risk being killed if they to climb away. The United Nations Peace Army tries to find a way to get all three out, but inefficiency runs amok and it appears that the trio may never get out of the hot zone alive. A crazed media (that is apparently found all over the world) just adds to the heated situation with their usual exploitation antics. 'No Man's Land' was quietly ignored for most of 2001, but hit fire at the right time mainly due to the critics saving the movie from obscurity. This is a rather simple film about very complex situations. Writer/director Danis Tanovic crafts a movie that teaches a somewhat ignorant world about some very terrible times in his native homeland (fighting continues almost non-stop over there it seems). The Bosnians and Serbians only seem to be separated by uniforms and different ideals. Failed diplomacy and war-like antics continue to dominate that part of the planet unfortunately. Thought-provoking, darkly funny, intense, smart and very intelligent, 'No Man's Land' is one of the better foreign language pictures of recent memory. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,12 November 2003
The Longest Day," The Original World War II Combat Epic

However, the supporting cast has a diverse range of actors such as Sean Connery, Red Buttons, Sal Mineo, Robert Wagner, Stuart Whitman, George Segal, Robert Ryan, Roddy McDowall and Jeffrey Hunter. This was the definitive World War II film before 1998 when it was dethroned by both 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Saving Private Ryan', but make no mistake of it 'The Longest Day' is still outstanding in every way imaginable and it continues to stand up well as the years go by. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,5,7,8 December 2001

But trouble looms as the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh in perhaps a star-making role) has his eyes on the club and Kidman herself. Kidman is put into a dilemma as all she has worked and slaved for could be taken away in a heartbeat by Roxburgh. The fact that her heart belongs to McGregor adds to the problem. Jim Broadbent (Oscar-winning for 'Iris' even though he is much better in this film) steals every scene as the master of ceremonies at the club. John Leguizamo also does the best work of his career as McGregor's vertically-challenged best friend. 'Moulin Rouge' is a smart film that is a mix of 'Cabaret' and 'Titanic'. It is both highly dramatic and visually stunning in every way imaginable. This is hands down the best musical produced in over 35 years and its great success critically and economically could be enough to resurrect the Hollywood musical, an art that has been in limbo since the late-1960s.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," If I Could Turn Back Time.
","As Hurricane Katrina looms in 2005 New Orleans, an elderly woman (Cate Blanchett in very heavy makeup) in a hospital thinks back to the titled character (Brad Pitt), a man who actually lived life physically in reverse from an elderly gentleman backwards to a newborn via her adult daughter (Julia Ormond) reading from an old journal. As Button is born under very strange circumstances and taken in by an African-American caregiver (Taraji P. Henson) in 1918, he sees history unfold before his eyes through the greater portion of the 20th Century and ends up becoming an extraordinary person who leads a somewhat normal existence. Pitt's performance is the stuff legends are made of cinematically speaking. He is so good that most everyone else (except for supporter Henson) somewhat gets lost in the shuffle. Blanchett and female co-star Tilda Swinton (who ends up having a substantial role for a short period of the nearly three-hour running time) seem a bit lost and out-of-place, however. With that said, director David Fincher has still crafted an amazing production which benefits greatly from its adapted screenplay (from a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and adapted by co-screenwriter Eric Roth), cinematography, soundtrack, editing, and subtle visual/makeup effects. Pitt is the revelation which helps to overcome the film's shortcomings and make it a memorable and highly emotional experience at the movies. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,17 March 2009

Now the fate of the galaxy and all mankind is left in the hands of Autobot Optimus Prime and his robotic soldiers. 'Transformers' came about in 1984 and made a splash in the United States with a popular toy line and cartoon series. While definitely nostalgic and effective to a point, the concept is somewhat limited and simple-minded. This is what happens with this mainstream box office dominator which has cleaned up financially, but critically it needs a lube job. A wide range of actors have less personality and heart than the special effects-laden robots which are more reminiscent to those corny 1950s Asian monster entities than to 21st Century cinematic live animation. The film is too long, it lacks substance, it has no tone, it is short on brains, and its pacing is a total train-wreck. Even the visual effects and sound are annoying, distractive, and migraine-inducing. Director Michael Bay continues to make films that please audiences who just want to see lots of explosions. However, he fails to show any growth when it comes to mandatory cinematic elements like screenplay, characterization, storytelling, and even rudimentary aspects of cinematography and editing.

Lincoln," Historical Lessons Still Viable Today.
","Sixteenth U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (a mind-blowing part by the seemingly always flawless Daniel Day-Lewis) struggles to get his policies for emancipating all enslaved African-Americans passed through the Legislative Branch of government as the bloody final days of the Civil War continue in early 1865. An amazing cinematic achievement by director Steven Spielberg as he primarily uses the the nearly unending novel 'Team of Rivals' by Doris Kearns Goodwin to create a portrait of quite possibly the most polarizing political and social reforms in this country's long history. In a time now when bi-partisanship is a romantic idea which seems more hypothetical than realistic, Lincoln struggled with North vs. South and Republican vs. Democrat just as contemporary presidents today do. Tommy Lee Jones steals every scene as Thaddeus Stevens, a politician trying to get all of Lincoln's policies through Congressional meanderings. Sally Field is also on hand as Lincoln's wife who struggles herself with the death of the couple's young son. Field's emotional fire has to be tamed though as her part could almost be an entire movie to itself and in the end the 16th President's ability to somehow immerse himself further in the nation's civil war and its possible political future uncertainties even after a potential emotional breakdown after his family's personal tragedy. 'Lincoln' is deeper than an ocean. It has a bare minimum of action and is highly talkative ala something in the line of 'Lawrence of Arabia' or even 'Gandhi'. Spielberg almost makes the film feel like an elaborate stage play with top-of-the-line performers going effortlessly from scene to scene and creating emotional fireworks. Day-Lewis is the catalyst, but his supporting cast never backs down from his challenge of acting excellence as they all add to his almost mythic portrayal of quite possibly our most important commander-in-chief. As usual, Spielberg creates a historical atmosphere (basically showing Washington, D.C. as a small village which doubles as a mud trap of a town with moist soil at least a foot deep in almost every direction) which puts his audience in another time and another place. Towering achievement on many various cinematic levels. 'Lincoln' is destined to be one of those rare productions which will likely survive time, its critics, and those who fail to believe in the power of the cinema to educate, influence, and enlighten.

Million Dollar Baby," Boxing Ring of Life.
","Truly excellent film from director Clint Eastwood about a 30-something woman (a striking turn by Hilary Swank) from Missouri who dreams of becoming a boxer. She finally makes it out to California, meets trainer Eastwood (who wants nothing to do with her), and tries to convince him to help her with her sports career. Swank hangs around the gym, to Eastwood's dismay, and gets help from an old former fighter (Morgan Freeman in his finest performance) who now stays around and acts as a janitor at Eastwood's sweat-box. Reluctantly, Eastwood starts to help Swank and slowly they develop a father-daughter bond as Swank indeed starts a meteoric rise in the female boxing ranks. However, 'Million Dollar Baby' is not really about women boxers. It is a tale about three characters that are all broken up inside emotionally and all are trying to cling to something that can repair their damaged psyches. Swank, admitted white trash, feels like someone when she is fighting. The 15 minutes of fame she gets from it is something that makes her feel adequate and complete as a person. Eastwood is a devout Catholic that just does not understand God's ultimate plan. He tries hard to see that everything that happens does happen for a reason, but the fact that Freeman lost an eye while he was fighting under Eastwood's care still haunts him. This point makes Eastwood leery about putting his male boxers in the ring for championship bouts. And then there is Freeman (who also narrates here ala 'The Shawshank Redemption'), an individual that just seems tired and beaten by life in general. He has come to the realization (long before we ever see his character on film) that life is going to continue to punch him in the face and he has admitted defeat and put up a figurative white flag. His deep emotions are hidden by a worn-out body and a somewhat indifferent disposition. Landmark direction by Eastwood as he goes way beyond his best works behind the camera ('Unforgiven and 'Mystic River') and arguably has his best performance in front of it. Freeman and Swank have jaw-dropping roles that make the whole thing work. This movie is not just about sports. It is a powerful motion picture about life, love, friendship, family, spirituality, mercy and the choices that define us as human beings. 'Million Dollar Baby' raises huge questions about living that are not easily answered and many times not easily understood. An emotional knock-out that ranks real high on the list of greatest movies ever made. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,5,11,5 April 2005

The film deals with an outer space crew who is trying to retrieve a mysterious ship which is trapped deep in the outer limits.  The original crew have all been killed and now this crew must find out why.  Why?  Why? Why?  That seems to be the key question of this film.  The screenplay is all over the universe.  It adds elements from films like 'The Exorcist', 'Aliens', 'The Abyss', 'Apollo 13', 'Jaws', and just about every other film ever produced.  If one idea had been used throughout, then the film would have been admirable and watchable if nothing else.  However the references to the aforementioned films make 'Event Horizon' a movie that wants desperately to be good, but just does not have the goods to make that dream a reality.

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," And That Is the Rest of the Story.
","In 1953 CBS broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow (an unforgettable turn by David Strathairn) and producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) decided to take a stand against Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy (actual archive footage here) and his witch-hunt against potential Communists in the U.S. Investigative journalism was born here and the events are historically imperative not just for the news field, but for rights of all American citizens. 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' is another in the long line of critical successes this year that deals with highly complex and difficult subject matter. Clooney is a one-of-a-kind when it comes to directing, but his style is definitely not for all tastes. The picture's tone, flow and look make the viewer feel tense, uncomfortable and claustrophobic. The movie is black and white, but in truth it is gray. It has that 1953 television screen look to it that honestly makes it appear cheap and unrefined. Also smoke is in seemingly every frame. I nearly got lung cancer myself watching as cigarette smoke is prevalent throughout thus we have light gray on a slightly darker gray canvas. Though used by Clooney to prove a point, the style is not easy to watch or adapt to. Supporting players all over the place come and go like they are on a merry-go-round. Frank Langella stands out as a top executive with CBS. Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey, Jr. deliver distracting parts as closet husband and wife employees (CBS did not allow married couples to work for them during that time). Jeff Daniels, Thomas McCarthy, Tate Donovan and Alex Borstein are also on hand in the venture. Ray Wise's tortured newsman who worries about having his life taken away with past affiliations brings much needed heart, emotion and light to an otherwise dreary and depressing film that nearly never finds its legs. Important story and fascinating production from varying angles and views, 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' will never find a mainstream appeal with the masses but it still has many positives going for it if you can find them through the clouded screen. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,4,6,10 February 2006
Mulholland Drive," The Ultimate Rubik's Cube.
","'Mulholland Dr.' is something else. It is a film that will make you question your own sanity in many ways. Naomi Watts is the young, starry-eyed Canadian that wants to make it big in Hollywood. She is naive and thinks that dreams can come true if you want them bad enough. Watts discovers a very beautiful woman with amnesia (Laura Harring in a sizzling performance) in her aunt's house in L.A. and she becomes determined to help Harring out. Harring is mysterious and her near-fatal car crash occurred on the dark and winding Mulholland Dr. Throughout several oddball and very dark scenes take place. A young director (Justin Theroux) learns that Hollywood is run by strange underworld figures that are quiet, but ruthless. Another strange side-story is the mysterious man behind the diner that is seen in another character's dreams. An inept assassin also runs around causing unwanted trouble for himself and others. Then of course there are cameos by Robert Forster and Billy Ray Cyrus. The film twists into darkness as it progresses as Watts' and Harring's relationship turns sexual. A fine line between reality and fantasy is skewered and it comes down to a strange Pandora's box that holds the true secrets to 'Mulholland Dr.'. Oscar-nominated director David Lynch also shows that not all you see and hear is real, even though one's mind might think so. The film seems artificial at times, showing Hollywood as a nice place where dreams can come true. But then the dreams are turned into vivid nightmares of what could possibly be the true reality. David Lynch somehow makes this whole thing work and he makes it work beautifully in this reviewer's opinion. The film is a trumped-up version of 'The Twilight Zone' and it adds many techniques that made Alfred Hitchcock the true master of suspense. Many wonder what this film is truly about. I am not sure. I am not sure Lynch even knows, but I am going to give it a shot. 'Mulholland Dr.' is the dark side of the human condition. It is a film that shows how easy one can lose one's soul if bad elements are let in. There are figures that seem somewhat supernatural to me in this movie. It seems that many of the characters are 'messengers' that are all after one thing: Naomi Watts' soul. Watts lets the elements in and in the end she cannot overcome them. What she thinks she wants seems attractive on the outside, but there are cobras on the inside that will be too strong to fight off. In short, 'Mulholland Dr.' is a brilliant piece of film-making and it is brilliant due to its unique aspects and the fact that it is what one thinks it is. There is no right or wrong answer and it is a film that makes you think. 'Mulholland Dr.' is a complicated puzzle for the minds of cinema fanatics. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,194,309,26 March 2002

","Oh goodness 'Dumb & Dumber' is one of those films that is just crazed out of its mind. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels star as two dimwits who go cross-country to Aspen, Colorado to find a beautiful woman (Lauren Holly) who left a briefcase full of money in an East Coast airport to pay kidnappers to get her husband back. Of course, Carrey does not know this and thinks she left the briefcase by accident so he takes the money unwittingly. Carrey also has an obsession with Holly to complicate manners. Throughout Carrey and Daniels dominate the action and the strangest coincidences occur as the bad guys think that Carrey and Daniels are after them and the good guys try to figure out the duo's connection with the kidnappers.

The Evil Dead," Dead Weight.
","Pathetic low-budget horror from a very young Sam Raimi is nothing but a gross-out cinematic (if you can it that) experience. Bruce Campbell and four other equally dim-witted people go to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and release an unspeakable evil that will not stop until they are all dead. Every horror film ever made before 'The Evil Dead' seems to have a little air time in this enormous yawn. The shoe-string budget was used on visually ugly special makeup effects that only lessen the value on an already useless flick. Like the equally worthless 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Evil Dead' is a would-be-shocker that ends up being more stupid than anything else. If you want to see a good low-budget horror flick check out 'Night of the Living Dead' (the 1968 version) or 'The Blair Witch Project' instead. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",Null,1,5,28 November 2002
8 Mile," Going the Last Mile of the Way.
","Very loosely based on the life of real-life rapper Eminem, '8 Mile' ends up being one of those movies that is more content with selling soundtracks than making a legitimate cinematic point. In 1995 Detroit, Eminem seems to be a young man going nowhere fast. His mother (Kim Basinger) is the only real family around (and that is not necessarily a good thing) and his friends (led by Mekhi Phifer) are little more than urban thugs, running around and causing mischief. Eminem struggles through as a laborer at a plant that manufactures car parts and also suffers with stage fright issues when he has the opportunity to free-style rap at shady competitions (Eminem shy!?). He meets a girl from the neighborhood (Brittany Murphy) and instantly becomes attracted to her, but her past and present activities are suspicious at best. Mean dudes, the broken landscape of a major metropolitan area, poor relationships and a fiery attitude may be too much for Eminem to overcome in the end. '8 Mile' is a film that I thought would be an intense U.S. slice of life, but it becomes a cop-out movie that staggers around for a plot and becomes a tiring music-video-styled horror. Eminem shows some real talent. I have always been indifferent to his music, but he shows the makings of a potentially impressive cinematic performer. Everyone else just gets lost in the ugly mess. Basinger and Phifer never do intrigue and Murphy seems wasted as well (she too has shown some talent in the past). Director Curtis Hanson (who dominated with 'L.A. Confidential' several years ago) seems like he just does not understand the film's dark landscape. I really think a director like Spike Lee, John Singleton or Antonie Fuqua would have been a better fit for '8 Mile'. The primary theme, 'Lose Yourself', was the Best Original Song Oscar winner for 2002. Eminem co-wrote that piece. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
The Piano," 88 Keys and a Dozen Problems.
","Dark and bleak entry from writer-director Jane Campion (Oscar-winning for the former and Oscar-nominated for the latter) which concerns a mute British woman (electric Oscar-winner Holly Hunter) who moves to newly colonized New Zealand in the mid-19th Century. She has been promised in marriage to Sam Neill by her father. Thus she makes the long trek to the South Island of the small country with little more than her young daughter (surprise Oscar-winner Anna Paquin) and her most prized possession (the titled item). Hunter has refused to speak supposedly since the unfortunate death of her first husband and uses the piano as an outlet to express her feelings and thoughts. Immediately it is realized that Neill is not capable of love and that native Harvey Keitel may be the person that Hunter desperately needs in her life. A forbidden love affair blossoms between Hunter and Keitel, but how will Neill and Paquin react when Hunter's secret disappears? 'The Piano' thrives on its performances (Hunter and Paquin in particular) and has a soul of its own with its haunting score. However Campion's screenplay is not near as concrete as I would have liked. She seems unsure of where she wants to go with the story and ultimately her direction suffers as well. Honored left and right in 1993, 'The Piano' pales miserably to 'Schindler's List' and lacks the overall heart and intensity of 'The Remains of the Day'. Still a good movie, but never quite hit the right notes with me. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,9,21,22 September 2003
Shrek 2," Green With Envy.
","Superior sequel to the good, but somewhat over-rated and even annoying original has the titled character (voiced by Mike Myers) going to meet his new in-laws (voiced by John Cleese and Julie Andrews). An event-filled honeymoon with new wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) starts the ball rolling and the film's early momentum is enough to sustain the animated production until a wonderful second act where comedy, drama and crazed sequences make 'Shrek 2' an immediate American classic. Once again Donkey (Eddie Murphy, still the best character of the series) is back and also a super-slick feline named Puss in Boots (voiced superbly by Antonio Banderas) gets added to the mix. Of course there are always antagonists in fairy tales and here a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and her son (Rupert Everett, aka the Prince Charming) look to push Shrek out of the picture so the Prince can marry Fiona, possibly giving the more traditional ending that we have come to expect. 'Shrek 2' is a technological marvel (the first one was as well though), but I thought this film was a lot smarter than the first because there are more vivid characters in the key roles and they are all developed better than before. The first film became an animated 'road picture' that eventually wore out its welcome to an extent (the original was still very good, but it never reached its full potential with me). Pop culture dominates 'Shrek 2' as subtle references to American classics like 'From Here to Eternity', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'E.T.---The Extra-Terrestrial', 'Ghostbusters', 'The Little Mermaid', 'The Fabulous Baker Boys', 'Mission: Impossible' and 'The Mask of Zorro' make the movie feel like a trumped-up cartoon trip down memory lane with slightly stranger and funnier results. Also non-cinematic references to the Academy Awards, the popular show 'Cops' and even O.J. Simpson's unforgettable drive in his white Ford Bronco add hilarious flashes and well-timed laughs. Overall the movie is about as perfect as it can be. It already makes a case to stand tall with animated masterpieces of the past. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,2,2 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Everybody Was Kung-Fu Fighting.
","Films like 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' rock your otherwise normal and conformist world with death-defying elements that will keep you tense, excited, interested and definitely intrigued. Quentin Tarantino's fourth feature-length production is a blood-bath of whacked situations reminiscent of 1950s-styled Asian action flicks and 1960s/70s European film noir pulp garbage that all mixes and meshes to one of the most invigorating and intense cinematic experiences of the past three decades. An assassin (Uma Thurman) is gunned down in a desolate church just outside of El Paso, Texas by five fellow killers (the never seen, but always heard David Carradine in the titled role, Michael Madsen, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah and Lucy Liu) for unclear and unexplained reasons. Thurman, about to be married, also watched helpless as everyone else in the church was killed mercilessly. Four years pass and Thurman has been stuck in a coma and actually dodged death as an attempt on her life was strangely aborted. Of course Thurman pops out of it at the most convenient of moments and her only thoughts are of revenge on those aforementioned players who tried unsuccessfully to take her down. Thurman's quest takes her to suburban America (where she finds housewife/mother/little league coach Fox) and even to Tokyo (where she tracks down underworld crime boss Liu). Keep in mind though that Tarantino has never cared for chronology or production order so naturally he would rather leave those methods at the door. Thus the film goes forward, back, pauses and even goes from color to black-and-white on occasion. The effects may be dizzying, but may also win you over in a wickedly intelligent way. 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is a thrill-ride that matches very well with Tarantino's earlier works (even though this is arguably his weakest effort). Tarantino also smartly took a page away from 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy by splitting this saga into two parts (this project began as one very long epic film). Samuel L. Jackson once said that Tarantino was the best he had ever seen at stealing other people's ideas and changing them just enough to make a completely new concept. This is very evident here as Tarantino even uses that cheap-looking exploitation angle and further advances the picture with a crazed Asian-styled Toonami sequence that somehow seems more poetic than pathetic. The movie is ultra-violent, but does not fall to shock value or silly teenage-styled slasher clichés. The main reason is the dynamite performance by Thurman and Tarantino's second-to-none direction. Tarantino is kind of like the Dennis Rodman of Hollywood. Everyone either loves or hates him. You can either let yourself be sucked in by his brilliant creativity or you can be repulsed by his risk-taking and obvious bad boy attitude towards the medium. While still not a perfect movie, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' delivers a darkly funny and exhilarating experience that will keep you awake if nothing else. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,2,12 January 2004
The Last Emperor," An Example of Quantity and Quality Combining to Make an Unforgettable Film
","'The Last Emperor' is a near perfect film.  It was nominated for nine Oscars in 1987 and it won nine (including the Best Picture Oscar).  The movie is about the life of Pu Yi (John Lone), China's last emperor.  In spite of becoming emperor at the age of three, Yi's reign was more of a burden than anything else.  Yi would ultimately end up living an unsavory life of imprisonment which is heartrending to the viewer.  'The Last Emperor' is visually stunning.  The minute details are amazing.  However, the story stands up high as well.  Historically accurate for the most part, 'The Last Emperor' is easily one of the top 10 films of the 1980s and overall an exceptional achievement in every cinematic department known to man.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,75,90,26 September 2000
Jerry Maguire," Show Me the Money!!!
","'Jerry Maguire' did something very strange in 1996: it had both critical and commercial success.  This was evident in the fact that the four other Best Picture nominees for the year were all independent productions.  'Jerry Maguire' shows the business world of America at its worst, in this case in the sports industry.  When Jerry Maguire, a sports agent, (played by Oscar-nominated Tom Cruise) has a breakthrough one night he realizes that quality is more important than quantity.  Of course he is fired from his job and loses all of his clients except Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in his Oscar-winning performance).  Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) has left the business with Maguire, agreeing with his views.  However, Maguire struggles with his separation from the sports corporation (losing his fiance and the first pick in the NFL Draft).  However, he survives and learns that living well and loving well are the keys to happiness.  All in all, 'Jerry Maguire' is classic Hollywood stuff made in the present-day.  Cameron Crowe's script and direction are subtle, but extremely effective.  Tom Cruise delivered his best performance to date.  Renee Zellweger proved to be the find of the year and Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s quotes and scenes he stole were enough to win him the Oscar in a very competitive year in the Best Supporting Actor category.  'Jerry Maguire' is not a perfect film. In fact it is flawed in many ways and is not very accurate in some areas.  However, its ability to mix comedy, romance, and drama make it a very entertaining film.  The performances are all excellent.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,53,71,25 June 2000

The studio balked in horror and the film was cut to a more traditional running time. Thus we have a wildly confusing and disjointed tale that makes little sense and has plot holes in every major cinematic area. IMF agent Tom Cruise is brought in from a rock-climbing vacation to chase down a sadistic group of international terrorists led by Dougray Scott and Richard Roxburgh who have stolen a genetically modified disease known as Chimera. Of course we have a return of computer genius Ving Rhames and recruitment of world-renowned thief Thandie Newton (appropriately appealing in the lead female part). A red-hot start is followed by an interminable set-up that never does jell and bolts of energy are killed by contrived martial arts fighting and motorcycle chase sequences that show just how pretentious and self-absorbed that Robert Towne's (who wrote 'Chinatown', of all things) crazed script is.

Two New York City port authority police officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena) get trapped as the first tower crumbles to the ground and we get a human drama that transcends time and the overall tragedy of that fateful day. The two men think about their lives and loves as their wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) cope with the very real possibilities that their husbands will not ever come home again. Stone's picture lacks the intensity and nervous feelings generated by 'United 93', but the human interest is right on key. Stone, a noted conspiracy theorist who always has his ear to the pavement, decides to go the opposite route here and focus on the way that we joined together and raised up as one as buildings fell to the ground and changed the world forever.

Black Hawk Down," Without a Doubt, the Best Film of 2001.
","'Black Hawk Down' is everything that 'Saving Private Ryan' wanted to be and should have been. But the film is smarter than Spielberg's masterpiece and director Ridley Scott (Oscar-nominated) took a few pages out of Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' to convey some really strong messages about war and what the U.S. military is in this day-and-age. It is 1993 and warlords are controlling Somalia and the capital city of Mogadishu is an important initiative for the U.S. to control as they try to prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of poor people who are unable to get food and supplies needed to survive. The mission is simple: capture the warlords, seize the city and clear the area so supplies can be transported to the starving people of the country. A 30-minute mission then turns ugly as the U.S. is ill-prepared and they under-estimate the fire-power of those on the ground. What follows is total chaos as two helicopters are shot down and a 30-minute exercise turns into a frightening 15-hour battle for survival within the walls of the city. In all dozens of Americans were wounded and 19 ended up dead in the event, not to mention 100s of Somalians as well who lost their lives. Ridley Scott spares no expense in the gore department as the film is brutally realistic and sometimes very difficult to watch, but Scott's film is very honest. Early on, he shows how the U.S. acted before the attack and it is not complimentary at all when it comes to the military. It shows a group of young men that are unaware of where they are and ignorant of the fact that danger is looming from every direction. Some were turned off by this, but I felt it made the film much better as it showed why this tragedy happened. The best performances came from Sam Shepard, Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore and Ewan McGregor, but this is a director's movie from the word 'go'. This is the best film of Ridley Scott's illustrious career and with much competition, it was the best film of 2001. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,4,14 March 2002

The Dark Knight," Sledgehammer Body Shots.
","Like a heavyweight prizefight with nothing but stellar body blows and pinpoint accurate jabs, 'The Dark Knight' is an amazing achievement which transcends the previous 'Batman' installments and all other products from the suspect superhero genre. With shades of Martin Scorsese and Michael Mann apparent from the outset, director/co-writer Christopher Nolan turns the concept into a cop and robbers epic with vivid characters in every direction, dizzying outcomes, and a truly intelligent and emotional story for the masses. The famed title character (Christian Bale) is continuing to take down high-level crime associates (led by Eric Roberts), double-crossing middle men, and low-rent would-be cutthroats. However, a new evil is about to pop up---a crazed mad man with war paint (the late Heath Ledger) who is robbing Gotham's criminal element of millions in crazed bank robberies. Now The Joker has a deviant plan to take down Batman by blackmailing the city's underworld power players in an all-out war for supremacy in a metropolitan area which is quickly becoming a war-zone with domestic terrorism taking center-stage. District Attorney Aaron Eckhart looks to take on the criminal elements head-on with the help of assistant Maggie Gyllenhaal (taking Katie Holmes' part from 'Batman Begins') and police lieutenant Gary Oldman who still seems to be the only law enforcement officer who is definitely on the level. Bale's want and need for a regular life makes it appear Eckhart could truly be the city's 'White Knight', but in this chaotic chess match there will be battles aplenty with unpredictable and demoralizing outcomes. Unforgettable masterpiece which is a film noir-styled triumph of style and substance. Ledger's part is amazing as he turns a literal comic book caricature into a cunning, complex, difficult, enigmatic, and mysterious mad man with brutal psychotic tendencies and strange viewpoints. He is the brightest flame in a film of constant fire and surprising fireworks. Every performer is on target, however---from Bale's tortured Bruce Wayne/Batman to role players Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Michael Hall, and Cillian Murphy (in a very short cameo).

Friends with Benefits," More Evidence There Are No Shortcuts.
","Young urban professionals Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake become friends after Kunis (a corporate headhunter) recruits Timberlake (a high-class magazine editor) to New York City to take a job with magazine giant GQ (Gentleman's Quarterly). Their friendship blossoms as both are discontented with failed romances. Thus they decide to have a physical relationship which is meant to avoid complications and complexities of would-be deeper emotional bonds. Of course we all know this will be a recipe for all kinds of turmoil and conflict which will ultimately develop between our two leads. 'Friends With Benefits' makes itself out to be a revolutionary addition to the romantic genre, but in the end it is just as predictable as dozens of its type. Kunis and Timberlake make for an interesting pairing, but their chemistry is more sporadic than it is sizzling. Richard Jenkins gives one of his finest performances as Timberlake's father who is experiencing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, but his appearance (along with daughter Jenna Elfman) is too late and really becomes too much of a side-story that the audience does not necessarily need (I think I would have rather had a film where Jenkins' character was the focus). Patricia Clarkson is loopy and in the way as Kunis' 1970s-obsessed mother who throws out everything verbally except words of wisdom. She is almost like Kunis' daughter instead of the other way around. Also along for the ride is gay sports editor Woody Harrelson who comes around Timberlake with would-be hilarious one-liners and distorted views about relationships and life in general. Harrelson's character, like Clarkson's, was probably not needed at all in the final analysis. Tiring clichés, an interminable running time, weakly-drawn characters, and stupid gimmicks (the recurring flash mobs in particular) cause 'Friends With Benefits' to collapse by its final resolution. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,3,9 August 2011

Allen stars as a Jewish stand-up comic who falls in love with aspiring actress Diane Keaton (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn as the titled character). Their relationship is explored throughout the course of the film in a gentle and warm-hearted way. Allen's unique views and brand of humor are prevalent from start to finish and the film is clearly made in the 1970s as many issues from that time period are explored as the film progresses. 'Annie Hall' is simple in many ways, but deals with romantic issues in complex ways and the film is just so intelligent that it is near impossible to dislike. Woody Allen is brilliant as he usually is. Diane Keaton hit super-stardom as well with her role. The supporting cast includes the likes of Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall, Tony Roberts, Christopher Walken and Colleen Dewhurst. Look for an unknown Jeff Goldblum as an extra during the Los Angeles sequence. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,45,67,15 March 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," The 'Cuckoo's Nest' for the MTV Generation
","'Girl, Interrupted' is a suspect film that over-achieves due to dynamite performances and formulaic processes that have worked in Hollywood for decades. The film is based on author Susanna Kaysen's (Winona Ryder) 18-month stay in a mental asylum in the 1960s. Writer-director James Mangold goes for something like Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and somewhat succeeds. Instead of men though, the film focuses on women of an asylum. Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie carries the film much like Jack Nicholson did in the aforementioned film. She is an energizer bunny of enthusiasm that the film had to have. Winona Ryder does good work, as she usually does. Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave also do well in limited time. Overall the film is good, but nothing truly special. It lacks the heart and intelligence that made 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' so great in the mid-1970s. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,0,4 August 2001

","'2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of those films that is very difficult to describe.  Kubrick's style is on display in full-force here.  The film deals with a mission to Jupiter to find out what happened to another group of astronauts who had mysteriously disappeared years earlier.  Kubrick analyzes the evolution of man, the meaning of life, and everyone's own spirituality in a very unconventional way.

The Graduate," Dominant Film That Still Delivers Over 30 Years Later
","'The Graduate' is one of those trail-blazing films of the late-1960s that continues to get better with age.  Dustin Hoffman (Oscar-nominated) stars as the title character, a young man who does not know what he really wants in life.  His parents' next-door neighbor (Anne Bancroft, in an Oscar-nominated role) seduces Hoffman and she eventually convinces him to have an affair with her.  Hoffman becomes basically a 'play-thing' in a loveless relationship and he realizes that what he thought he wanted was not what he really wanted after all.  He becomes fixated on Bancroft's daughter instead (Katharine Ross, in her Oscar-nominated part).  Bancroft does anything and everything to ruin Hoffman's chances with Ross after he dismisses her. Hoffman becomes so obsessed that he breaks up Ross's wedding to another man. In the end they flee together on a local bus, but at the end the question is: Now what?  'The Graduate' is biting satire at its finest.  It is a black-comedy, but its focus goes much further than that.  Mike Nichols examines sexual relationships and relationships in general.  He creates an atmosphere that is so realistic that the audience feels the pain of each of the characters.  Dustin Hoffman proved to be a high-class actor here and Anne Bancroft solidified her career even further.  This film was the first that really examined sex on the silver-screen and this fact as much as anything makes 'The Graduate' one of the more important movies in the history of the cinema.  A great achievement.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,7,10 October 2000

Enter a very young Debbie Reynolds as the voice behind Hagen's physical performances.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Memories.............Like the 16 Corners of My Mind.
","One of the strangest cinematic experiences I have ever had. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' deals with mind erasing, manipulation and the belief that love can indeed conquer all in the end---or can it? Co-writer Charlie Kaufman's (who has already puzzled me with 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.') thoughts obviously go into hyper-overdrive here from the word go. Lonely man Jim Carrey meets the eccentric and multi-hair-colored Kate Winslet and a romance blossoms, but nothing is quite as it seems. Winslet has apparently gone to a clinic where her memories of Carrey have been erased forever. Thus she acts like she does not know him anymore. Carrey decides to get even by having the same procedure done to erase Winslet from his mind. He goes to see a specialist (Tom Wilkinson) and is soon going through the procedure at the home of one of Wilkinson's employees (Mark Ruffalo). Also with Ruffalo is co-worker Elijah Wood (who has developed feelings for Winslet) and hospital secretary Kirsten Dunst. Dunst has secrets aplenty herself as she is secretly dating Ruffalo and has an unclear relationship with Wilkinson. These are really side-stories though as Carrey goes on a harrowing journey while unconscious during the procedure to salvage what he believes he and Winslet once had. Shades of 'Vertigo' here as we see one of those love stories that is really too complicated and confusing for celluloid. The journey into the human mind and the emotions associated with true love are aspects that come through in very unorthodox and down-right confusing fashions. To be honest I do not understand everything about this film, but it still struck nerves deep in me. I felt numb by the whole production as the drama goes to the outer limits and the comedy feels forced and somewhat out of place. Innovative and creative, but landmark and impressive? Not completely sold on those last two. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,2,5,17 April 2005
Once Upon a Time in America," The Very Definition of a Tortured Masterpiece.
","'Once Upon a Time in America' is probably the most difficult film I have ever encountered in terms of completing an overall accurate cinematic criticism. This movie just grows in myth and debate as the years come and go. Co-writer/director Sergio Leone (who became an international success with 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'For a Few Dollars More' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' in the late-1960s) could not really figure out what to do with the complicated novel 'Hoods' when adapted to the silver screen. He struggled through with writes, re-writes and several versions of this production. Every version seemingly has more questions than the one before. There are six screenwriters credited. In the end the final product (the very long running 229-minute version) is one of those films that cannot really be talked about. If you try to talk about this production with someone unfamiliar with it, you will leave them dumb-founded and completely confused. Elements of time, situations, heart of the story and characterization get mixed up into a long and winding road of a movie that is extremely deep and definitely complicated. An elderly Jewish man in the 1960s (Robert DeNiro with heavy makeup) comes back to his old New York neighborhood and goes on a quiet and sad journey of remembrance and personal loss. Flashbacks to the early-1920s start quickly as we see a young group of Jewish adolescents in New York (Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, Adrian Curran and Brian Bloom among them) run around town and take advantage of hard-core criminal syndicates and dim-witted beat police officers. The group is wise beyond their years. They have street-smarts that put them into a high class of law-breakers. Early problems develop and brutal multiple murders take place by Tiler. He is sent to prison for the better part of the 1920s and returns in the 1930s in the form of Robert DeNiro. The other youngsters have grown up to become James Woods (in his first legitimate screen role), William Forsythe and James Hayden. DeNiro's reunion comes and goes like a lightning strike and the group gets back to old crime basics. By this time Prohibition is a way of life for the gangsters of major U.S. metropolitan areas and the quartet takes full advantage of that opportunity to run wild around the city and create immense profits for themselves. Killing men in their way and even at times raping women in their path becomes a norm as the production advances. Other characters leave almost as fast as they appear. Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams and Danny Aiello make such short runs that if you are not paying attention closely you might miss them. The women make more pronounced impressions. Youngster Jennifer Connelly grows to become Elizabeth McGovern (DeNiro's childhood love who has aspirations of acting and singing professionally) and Woods finds companionship with the ultra-erotic and smart-mouthed Tuesday Weld (doing her best work by a mile). As the movie continues, DeNiro and Weld develop a bond of hate that turns into mutual respect and eventually they even become the oddest of friends. Woods and DeNiro have a mutual unspoken brotherly love that translates into one of the most important relationships in the history of the movies (DeNiro and Al Pacino would later share a similar bond in the vastly under-rated 'Heat' some 11 years later). As all this happens though we begin to wonder if all we are seeing is the true reality. A dream-like beginning (which supposedly shows the fates of the four criminals) does not always fit with an amazingly strange final 30 minutes that seems to defy convention, time constraints for the characters and major cinematic screen-writing principles. Symbolism that has always been prevalent in the Italian cinema also comes into play here and these symbols may indeed hold the true answers to the mysteries within. And then again, maybe not. 'Once Upon a Time in America' was Sergio Leone's final film and it grows in myth and legend due to that fact. Much like similar movies like 'Giant' (James Dean's final performance) and 'Eyes Wide Shut' (Stanley Kubrick's hypnotic final production), this movie just seems to go into a higher stratosphere of Hollywood that totally ignores the typical norms that are always in association with other big-name movie products. James Hayden even died of an apparent drug overdose shortly after this film was initially released while performing on Broadway. And thus the legends grow and multiply. Overall in the end I do believe that 'Once Upon a Time in America' is arguably the finest movie of the 1980s. It is definitely a unique production that stands near the paramount of a decade that was mired in stupid comedies, teen flicks and endless horror movie installments. DeNiro is truly a revelation once again here and he dominates most in a production of seemingly endless wonderful performances. The movie is one of those that should be studied and analyzed over and over by those who really want to get to the root of cinematic history and development. Much like its running time, the excellence of 'Once Upon a Time in America' is nearly immeasurable. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,90,179,2 October 2003
The Mummy Returns," A Few More Cobwebs in the Tomb This Time.
","Oddly by-the-numbers sequel fast forwards 10 years from the original to 1933 London where the body of the titled monster (Arnold Vosloo) is shipped to be in a museum. Naturally horror strikes again as a mysterious woman (Patricia Velasquez, who basically had a cameo in the original) resurrects Vosloo and also tries to resurrect his ancient mistress (also played by Velasquez). The powers combine to try and defeat the Scorpion King (an warrior of the past played by The Rock) and his army back in ancient Egypt. The plan is to kill The Rock and turn his army to their side of darkness. Once again it is up to adventurer Brendan Fraser, Egyptologist Rachel Weisz (now Fraser's wife), their adolescent son (Freddie Boath) and Weisz's brother (the comical John Hannah) to stop Vosloo and Velasquez before they are able to take control of the world for good. 'The Mummy Returns' is a little jumping jack of a film that does not come straight at you near as well as the original did. If anything, this picture may be a little too smart for its own good. Old replays and concepts from the first installment come back with ho-hum results.

Chariots of Fire," Somehow Crossed the Finish-Line First
","'Chariots of Fire' is a fine motion picture that won the Best Picture Oscar in 1981, even though it was the longest of long-shots.  The film deals with two young Englishmen (Ben Cross and Ian Charleson) who have hopes of glory at the 1924 Olympics.  We see that their struggles almost cost them the opportunity to achieve the greatness that they both desire.  When they are both ultimately successful, Charleson feels that his win is due to God's glory and accepts the medal with the greatest of pride and admiration. However, after Cross wins the gold he feels somewhat disappointed and realizes that what he thought he wanted was not what he really wanted at all.  The insight into this motion picture is amazing.  Both athletes convey very common feelings that most people experience if they are serious enough in what they are doing, whether it be sports or something else.  The main focus of 'Chariots of Fire' is that the journey to get to the destination is more important and uplifting than the destination itself.  Many question the fact that this film won the Best Picture Oscar over 'Reds' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.  However, this is one time I cannot say anything negative about the Academy's decision.  The fact that this film won in 1981 is testimony to the fact that the Academy is one of the greatest organizations in the world.  Kudos to all involved here.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,4,4,29 July 2000
There's Something About Mary," The Farrelly Brothers' Do It Again.

Ben Stiller stars as a loser who wonders what might have been after he was unable to go to the prom with his true love Mary (Cameron Diaz). The reason he cannot go is an important part of the movie in itself. Fast-forward a few years and Stiller continues to think of Diaz. Of course he enlists the help of slimy private investigator Matt Dillon to find her, but a problem occurs: Dillon falls in love with Diaz. This creates a problem for Lee Evans who plays a scholar in front of Diaz but is really a simple pizza delivery man. What follows are crazy situations and oh yes, don't forget Stiller's friend Chris Elliott who has a secret of his own. The film is just amazing in its ability to make the audience laugh. Every gag works to perfection and the whole film is a test to get through because you are laughing so hard that you might miss the next gag which is coming up.

The Last Samurai," The Sword Is Truly Mightier Than the Pen.
","Deliberately paced and opulent production from director Ed Zwick (of 'Glory' and 'Courage Under Fire' fame) tells the story of a U.S. military adviser (Tom Cruise) in the post-Civil War era who is hired, along with several others, to modernize the Japanise Army in 1876. Cruise has to work with friend Billy Connolly and nemesis Tony Goldwyn in the venture, but the fact that he is being paid handsomely makes it a relatively easy decision to go to the exotic land. However it seems that the only true purpose for Cruise and company to go to Japan is to wipe out the last of the samurai warriors. The Japanese government and people look at the group as savages who must be wiped out because they pose a legitimate threat to everyone else (this is a strange view in the film though). After training a group of farmers and civilians, Cruise and his men are ambushed. The event leaves many of the commoners dead and strangely leaves Cruise a hostage (the only one taken). Samurai leader Ken Wantanabe (in what could possibly be a star-making role) is fascinated by Cruise and his military background. He looks at the enemy as an interesting counter-part rather than a sworn adversary. Tension continues as Cruise is nursed back to health by Koyuki (Wantanabe's sister and the widowed wife of one of the warriors Cruise killed). Soon though Cruise comes to realize just how honorable, respectful and classy the samurai way of life is. Sure it may not be what he is used to, but Cruise had become a war-weary alcoholic due to things he was used to. Youthful puppet emperor Shichinosuke Nakamura is constantly put in bad situations as he is torn by his friendship with Wantanabe and what everyone else in his country wants (the elimination of the samurai life forever). Modern warriors and new battle-styled technologies are bound to clash in possibly the most bloody of ways. 'The Last Samurai' is a near excellent movie experience. Admittedly the set-up is difficult and the first act of the movie is honestly pretty bad. However Zwick uses a good tone and interesting characters to keep the audience going and then the movie reaches a near classic level. Cruise is a revelation (as he usually is). He is almost always near the top of his game and this is no exception. Wantanabe though practically steals the show. His character is quietly humorous, intelligent, sophisticated and definitely has an intense depth as well. Zwick, who is arguably the least respected director in Hollywood today, once again proves he can handle intense battle sequences and quiet character moments as well. The heart, soul and intelligence that made 'Glory' and 'Courage Under Fire' such wonderful productions once again shine through here (though probably not quite as brightly). Perfect cinematography by John Toll and an unforgettable score by Hans Zimmer just accentuates all the good things that are found within. Definitely makes a case for the best film of 2003. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,5,10,1 January 2004

A Clockwork Orange," Sick and Disturbing, But Ultimately Brilliant
","Stanley Kubrick directed and co-wrote this wild and crazy film which deals with a murdering, stealing, and raping Malcolm  McDowell and his small gang of thugs in a not-too-distant future.  They are in London and by night they terrorize anyone and everyone who they want.  When McDowell is betrayed by his fellow mates, he is put into prison and is subjected to an experimental therapy which works wonders for the youth.  Now the thought or sight of violence is sickening to him.  He also grows sick of Beethoven's music, which he once loved, because of its use in the experiment.  When he is freed, he runs into all those who he crossed in his past and they all have revenge in mind for McDowell.  McDowell ultimately tries suicide to escape his life, he fails, and is then given a formal apology from the state and is reverted back to the way he was in the beginning.  'A Clockwork Orange' is ultimately sick and disturbing, but conveys some real strong messages in unconventional ways.  Kubrick shows that there are some solutions to various problems, but many times those solutions cause new problems that are just as nasty, if not more so, than the first set.  McDowell shines in his role. His character is basically the only three-dimensional person in the movie and it is meant to be that way.  The other characters are meant to be somewhat flat and under-developed to show just how alone McDowell is in his twisted world.

The five have never worked together and really know nothing about each other. When the heist turns into a fire-fight with cops out on the streets of downtown L.A. it becomes obvious that someone is really an undercover cop. But which one? Tarantino knew way back in 1992 how to eliminate the bindings of straight story-telling and time elements as he uses flashbacks and sequence-less methods to get his points across. 'Reservoir Dogs' is a really great achievement for the genre because it was trail-blazing and unique for its era (and it stands the test of time very well). Tarantino would use this feature as a jump-board to do even better work ('Pulp Fiction' and 'Jackie Brown').

A sketchy and rarely talked about part of contemporary U.S. history here in a large and unwanted sleeping pill of near epic proportions.

Enter Mickey, (Burgess Meredith, in yet another Oscar-nominated role), who is a man who sees a bit of himself in the young fighter and realizes that this is his last chance at achieving the dreams of his youth.  Overall 'Rocky' is one of those films which is near impossible to say anything negative about.  It is far from a perfect film, but its parts together make it an unbelievable motion picture. 'Rocky' is more of an event than a movie and in the end all will be cheering for the underdog.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,7,14,29 July 2000
Shine," Who Knew That Playing a Piano Could Be So Much Work?
","'Shine' is a pure joy to behold.  Produced in Australia, it tells the true story of piano prodigy David Helfgott.  Helfgott suffered a major nervous breakdown on the threshold of an imminently great career.  The story shows him through a psychologically trying childhood, to his teenage years when he perfected his skills, to a stay in a mental asylum, and his subsequent return to stardom.  Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) played Helfgott during his teenage and adult years. Armin Mueller-Stahl is also excellent as the abusive father (in an Oscar-nominated performance).  However, the film stalls on several occasions.  This is bad considering that the film is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  Lynn Redgrave's role is terrible, she is totally wrong for this film.  'Shine' is a prime example of a near miss.  The film is very good in almost all aspects, but these problems keep 'Shine' from being the masterpiece it should have been.  4 out of 5 stars.",Null,11,18,25 June 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Darkness Is Even Darker in the Light
","SPOILER ALERT Stanley Kubrick's swan song is a well-made, hypnotic, and overall outstanding film which combines elements from all of the late director's earlier films.  Doctor Tom Cruise learns one night that his wife Nicole Kidman has thought about changing the course of both their lives for a one-night stand with a naval officer who she saw just once and did not even converse with.  They have a marijuana-induced argument which leads to emotional sparks for Cruise.  Now he is out to seek revenge on his wife because of her thoughts.  What follows is a strange journey into the deepest, darkest places of New York City and the human psyche, in general. Cruise learns that the daughter of one of his late patients has an infatuation for him, he almost becomes the victim of a hate crime as young college guys think that he is a homosexual, he is propositioned by a beautiful hooker, and he comes into contact with an old college buddy. The old friend is mysterious and Cruise becomes intrigued after he learns that the friend, now a piano player, has a gig at an unknown location.  Cruise gets the information needed to attend the 'get-together' and makes the necessary arrangements.  He runs into another strange situation when he goes to rent a costume for the occasion.  When he finally reaches his destination, he realizes that what he thought he wanted is not what he wants at all.  The wild and crazy thrill-ride of the night finally comes to a close, but the next day proves to be even darker and more disturbing. Cruise basically retraces the steps that he took the night before (not necessarily in the same order) and his 'eyes open wide' to see  everything that had happened the night before.  In the end, Cruise realizes that dark elements are even darker in the daylight than in the black of night.  He comes clean to Kidman and they both realize that sex, excitement, and thrills are fine in the fantasy world, but could be the poorest of elements in real life (given the right, or wrong, situation).  Kubrick's direction is amazing to say the least.  This film is not the ramblings of some old, washed-up film-maker.  Kubrick is always sure of where he wants to go and his screenplay keeps up the suspense, interest, and tenseness of the audience.  I can see why this film took so long to shoot.  The cinematography alone is a sight to behold.  Dark streets illuminated by Christmas lights and vivid colors shining through black backgrounds are commonplace throughout here.  The editing and set directions are also superb.  Tom Cruise is very strong as well.  He dominates the film the final two hours or so.  Nicole Kidman starts strong, but Cruise becomes the focus. All the supporters are strong as well.  Sydney Pollack and Vanessa Shaw shine the most.  If there was ever a film that was destroyed because of too much hype, it is this one.  All the talk of the long shoot, the excessive sexual situations, and the death of Kubrick made this film become a mainstream project.  The result was an excellent opening weekend, but a failure overall at the box office due to bad word-of-mouth.  The average movie-goer will not get anything out of this film.  This is a deep, thought-provoking film that is somewhat an art-house flick (even though I have never been crazy about that term).  The publicity about the sexual situations turned many away and brought in many who did not care about anything except seeing a bunch of naked women.  That is a real shame.  All this caused the film to be dismissed by the general public and by the Academy as well.  Overall 'Eyes Wide Shut' is an excellent film that ranks real high on Kubrick's list of credits (I would still have to put 'Dr. Strangelove', '2001: A Space Odyssey', and 'A Clockwork Orange' ahead of this film).  With all this said, 'Eyes Wide Shut' was probably the best film of 1999 and is one of the best films of the decade.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,5,10,17 October 2000
Pretty Woman," The Last Gasp for 1980s Style Flair.
","Pure Hollywood fluff story that is so smart and sports such a dynamite cast that it becomes one of the more wonderful films of the period. 'Pretty Woman' is pop culture at its finest as Julia Roberts (in an Oscar-nominated, icon-making role) is a prostitute on the mean streets of Los Angeles who gets a big financial break one night when she meets up with cold, but lonely business guru Richard Gere. They immediately create a bond and have a night of passion which soon becomes a week-long partnership with Gere and Roberts posing as love interests (and of course $3000 is involved as well). Could it be possible that Roberts, a lady with a heart of gold in spite of her background, is just the thing Gere has been needing in his life? A trumped-up adult-oriented version of 'Cinderella' is probably the best way to describe 'Pretty Woman'. The old Hollywood story gets a glossy new look thanks to director Garry Marshall (doing arguably his finest film-making work). Gere and Roberts make for one of the more attractive pairs the cinema has ever seen. They just shine beacons of light on one another it seems. The fact that both are very good performers definitely enhance their appearances though. A smashing soundtrack and that vivid 1980s style (even though this was released in 1990) make 'Pretty Woman' one of the big winners of the last few years. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,64,83,25 August 2003

Two musicians (Oscar-nominated Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) witness a mob hit and flee the state. They pose as two musicians in an all-girls band to hide out. Naturally this means that the two must disguise themselves as ladies to make their wild plan work. The typical insanity ensues as Marilyn Monroe is along for the ride as one of the sexy band members.

Inside Man," Feeling Sided.
","More cool than good, 'Inside Man' gives itself way too much credit. The movie wants to be smart and have as many twists and turns as a large plate of spaghetti, but ultimately the means to get to the point are never fully justified. Troubled police officer Denzel Washington and partner Chiwetel Ejiofor immediately get thrown into the middle of a bank robbery in Manhattan where hostages have been taken. The bank job is led by a cold and calculating sociopath (Clive Owen) who apparently has more motivation than just money. Bank owner Christopher Plummer is mysterious and seems to hold a secret that is at the deepest heart of the production. He hires a cutthroat business negotiator/cover-up artist (Jodie Foster) in the hopes of keeping his secret from the public. Clashes aplenty between Washington and all the other key players (SWAT captain Willem Dafoe included) come at the audience in heavy doses. Washington is the heat here and Owen is the ice. Time elements are jumbled with flash-forwards that add to the complicated puzzle that is the plot. Spike Lee proves that he can go mainstream and does come up with one his better movies of recent memory (I have always felt Lee is somewhat overrated), but 'Inside Man' has plot holes galore and if you think about it too long you will realize that you had a lot more fun watching the setup than you had experiencing the payoff. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,2,4,31 March 2006
Hoosiers," Excellent Film That Has Always Been Vastly Under-Rated
","'Hoosiers' is a film that feels like it was made during Hollywood's Golden Age.  The movie is somewhat based on the true story of a small Indiana high school that defied the odds in 1952 and won the state basketball championship.  Gene Hackman is the mysterious, hard-nosed coach that must win at all costs.  However, he has a secret from his past that could tear the team apart.  Hackman does some of the best work of his storied career here.  His character is reminiscent of his Oscar-winning turn in 'The French Connection' some 15 years earlier.  Barbara Hershey is super as usual as one of the school teachers in town.  Dennis Hopper shines the most in his greatest screen role.  He received his lone Oscar-nomination here by playing a drunken father of one of Hackman's players.  'Hoosiers' is very similar to 'The Last Picture Show' in its ability to show small-town life at its most realistic.  It is also a film that will have the whole audience cheering, ala 'Rocky'.  Easily the best basketball film ever made and one of the best, and most under-rated, films of the 1980s.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,0,0,28 October 2000
Pulp Fiction," It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!
","My oh my.  'Pulp Fiction' is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.",Null,310,493,25 June 2000
The Da Vinci Code," Decoding the Encoded.
","A murder inside the Louvre in Paris leads to an incredible journey for a Harvard professor (Tom Hanks) and a beautiful French detective (Audrey Tautou) as clues and puzzles seem to point to an unbelievable secret that could rock the very foundation of the Catholic Church and Christianity as a whole. Along the way they look for help from a cryptic expert (Ian McKellen) while dodging a pesky French police officer (Jean Reno). An eclectic cloak and dagger organization which includes priest Alfred Molina and albino monk Paul Bettany also attempts everything in their power to stop Hanks and Tautou from uncovering the greatest con ever conceived by man---the possibility of Mary Magdalene's real relationship with Jesus Christ and her true historical role. Dan Brown's ridiculously successful novel sadly falls flat for the most part on the silver screen. Director Ron Howard's picture is well made and highly ambitious, but its tone is oddball, its pace is sporadic, the chemistry among its stars is nowhere to be found, and its pathos are fuzzy and uninspired. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman's (who collaborated five years ago in 2001 with Howard on the critically superior 'A Beautiful Mind') adaptation is preposterous and totally unclear. 'The Da Vinci Code' drags its feet, then sprints with confusing action sequences and wild flash-points/flashbacks that will leave many more confused by the elaborate eye candy. A major loss that is just as disappointing and unwanted as the other cinematic busts of the 2000s ('Pearl Harbor', 'Gods and Generals, 'Troy', 'Alexander').

James Cameron reached new heights with this film and will always be remembered as the man who directed 'Titanic'.  From top to bottom the film is almost perfect.  Its special effects and minute details make it a real treasure to behold.  One feels as if they are really on that doomed liner.  The characters are excellent as well.  Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart delivered Oscar-nominated performances.  Overlooked, but equally potent was Billy Zane in a well-calibrated role.  However, Leonardo DiCaprio is just there it seems.

Young Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is recruited to Hogwart's School to learn the arts of being a wizard. He immediately makes friends in Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, but nothing seems quite right.

Chicago critic Richard Roeper called this 'The Wizard of Oz' of this film-going generation, but really come on. This movie is not in the galaxy of films as the aforementioned production. Early success here gives way to a nearly unending running time and special effects that could tire more than interest. Rickman, along with legitimate performers like Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Warwick Davis, John Hurt and Richard Harris get shoved aside by ugly visual effects and the film's three adolescent leads (behaving like mischievous brats throughout).

Three Colors: Blue," It's Not Easy Being 'Blue'.
","The first of legendary Polish director Krzysztof Kielslowski's 'Three Colors' trilogy (representing the three colors of the French national flag) is a hypnotic and intriguing journey which follows Juliette Binoche after she tries to gain total liberty (the representation of blue in the flag) after the deaths of her husband (a famous European composer) and young daughter in an automobile accident. Of course isolating oneself from all others is not easy to do as the past keeps on popping up and the future holds many uncertainties. The fact that Binoche's husband had an affair and the woman is now carrying his child is both ironic and tragic for all involved. In the end will Binoche be able to stop being blue? 'Blue', like all of Kielslowski's works, thrives on symbolism (the color popping up all throughout the film) and an unmistakable tone (much the way that Roman Polanski uses that feature in his better productions). The film is not for all tastes because of strong adult content and a distinct female flair (due to the almost total focus on Binoche), but 'Blue' is still a movie which is a testament to its excellent film-maker and its unique theatrical aspects. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,24,43,19 April 2003
The Untouchables," Few Films Can Touch Its Excellence.
","Outstanding production that was the best film of 1987 with the exception of the very dominant 'The Last Emperor'. 'The Untouchables' is the story of Elliot Ness (perfectly played by Kevin Costner) who tries to bring down Chicago Mob boss Al Capone (Robert DeNiro in one of his most under-rated roles) during the early-1930s. Illegal liquor smuggling and other much more serious crimes are running amok and corruption is all over. Costner realizes very fast that he must hand-pick his own men to bring DeNiro down for good. Thus he enlists the help of a young cop from the academy (Andy Garcia), a wimpy book-keeper (Charles Martin Smith) and a hard-nosed Irish beat cop (Oscar-winner Sean Connery in the performance of a lifetime). Together they slowly start to peel through the multiple layers of protection to get DeNiro for good. It seems that the fact that DeNiro has been lax in paying his income taxes could be his ultimate downfall. Beautifully directed by Brian De Palma, 'The Untouchables' stands very tall with the other great productions of the 1980s. Ennio Morricone's Oscar-nominated score is one of the finest the cinema has ever experienced. Really excellent. I have no negative comments on this production. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,128,208,31 July 2002
The Godfather: Part III," Outstanding, But Sadly Forgotten and Somewhat Misunderstood by Many
","Many believed that the series was complete in 1974. Even Francis Ford Coppola thought that another installment was unlikely. However in 1990, some 16 years later, 'The Godfather, Part III' was released with results that few could have perceived. The film was not very successful at the box office and many who did see the movie said 'ho-hum'. The critics were also indifferent to an extent. A Christmas release would create enough steam for the film to achieve a best picture nomination and seven nominations in all from the Academy (it failed to win any though). Of course 'Dances With Wolves' dominated the night and that film along with 'GoodFellas' are considered the class acts of that year. Why has 'The Godfather, Part III' failed to achieve a following like its two predecessors (parts I & II)? I am not sure I can answer that question. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is becoming an old man and his health is slowly worsening. He wants the family to become 100% legitimate and even makes a deal to link his finances to the Vatican. However Michael has become a bit naive and everyone double-crosses him. Now it appears that the only answer is to get back to the old ways. Younger sister Connie (Talia Shire) believes that Michael has grown soft and that Santino's (James Caan from the first film) illegitimate son should take control (Andy Garcia, in his Oscar-nominated performanece). He is ambitious and has the short fuse that his late father had and this is going to lead to fireworks for the family. He also starts seeing Michael's teenaged daughter (Sofia Coppola, Francis Ford's real-life daughter) and a romance blossoms. Meanwhile crime bosses Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna pose threats to the Corleones. Kaye (Diane Keaton) has divorced herself from Michael and their son (Franc D'Ambrosio) has somewhat sided with her. Michael's health takes a turn for the worse as he actually goes into a diabetic coma for a time during the film and when he does recover (not completely though) he starts to reflect on a life of loss. The ordering of Fredo's death (John Cazale) in the second installment and his Sicilian wife's murder in the original haunt Michael and he tries to come to terms with his life, but learns from a Catholic cardinal while in Sicily that he deserves all the suffering he experiences and realizes that his suffering will be even greater in the future. In fact there will be a finale that will be the 'fatal nail in the coffin' for Michael. 'The Godfather, Part III' is focused on Michael and that is why it is unique to the series. The first two sported so many rich characters that it was impossible to focus on just one. This film could be best described as 'Reflections of a Life of Loss'. The film is excellent and even though it is likely the weakest of the three when you compare them, it is somewhat unfair to put the three 'Godfather' movies together because they can all stand on their own. Great movies stand on their own and 'The Godfather, Part III' does just that. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,501,633,13 October 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Matrixed.
","'The Matrix Reloaded' continues the long and sometimes very confusing saga of a human race of people trying desperately to reclaim their place on the planet over a group of tyrannical Controllers that run everything in the real reality and the virtual reality worlds. The story picks up several months after its predecessor and Keanu Reeves is having recurring dreams of Carrie-Anne Moss' death. Laurence Fishburne and the two aforementioned players go to Zion (which was talked about the entire first film, but never seen) and we get greater insight to what remains of the human race. It appears that the Controllers (led by Hugo Weaving who has also struck gold in 'The Lord of the Rings' series) are about to attack Zion within three days and try to eliminate the few humans that remain. Thus the clock is ticking on Reeves and company as they try to stem the tide and possibly end the war for good. Unfortunately the Controllers have gained strength as Weaving is now able to duplicate himself endlessly. Twists and turns aplenty are in 'The Matrix Reloaded' and the only real solution in the end is a bridge to get us to the third entry in the series. The second chapter in the trilogy is a little better than the first (I was not a huge fan of the first film). It widens its scope and it explains a few things that were hard to comprehend in the initial installment. The introduction of several new characters (Jada Pinkett-Smith and the illuminating Monica Belluci in the roles) ends up adding new dimensions that I would have never been able to predict beforehand. There is lots more action as well. I found the first chapter way too talkative and a bit dull in many areas. This movie still suffers from some dull moments (the screenplay's dialogue is questionable at best), but the action sequences are mind-blowing to say the least. The special effects and editing techniques are even better than the Oscar-winning ones from its predecessor. When all is said and done though 'The Matrix Reloaded' is still not a total triumph with me. I remarked that the first film was 'as empty and meaningless as a painting by Picasso'. Admittedly I don't quite feel that strongly now after seeing this film. The first movie makes a lot more sense to me and I have a little more insight into what the Wachowski Brothers are trying to say here (the directors/co-writers). With that said I think the ideas in 'The Matrix' are a wide jumble that never do come together in a cohesive manner. In this series there are undertones of Biblical teaching, Greek philosophy, science-fiction story-telling and an almost endless number of elements from varying cultures around the world. When put together the experience is more migraine-inducing than it is interesting. 'The Matrix' series lacks everything that the recent 'The Lord of the Rings' series has. 'The Lord of the Rings' has a focus that keeps its audience interested and intrigued. It has a heart, mind and soul that put it above most other productions of the genre. 'The Matrix' has a better mind than I originally thought it had, but its heart and soul are still nowhere to be found. The series is very cold, sterile and at times a trial to get through. I am anxious to see how this series concludes, but in the end I am not sure I will care any more or less about 'The Matrix' and that makes it only average when it finally completes its long schizophrenic journey. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,3,26 June 2003

","Three adolescents (Jason Kelly, Connor Paolo and Cameron Bowen) in the 1975 Boston area fall to tragedy when Bowen (who grows to become Tim Robbins) is abducted by two pedophiles posing as beat cops. The event is chilling and leaves all three going down different routes of life. Kelly (who grows to become Sean Penn) became a hood, a trouble-maker who finally got his life straight after being in and out of jail as a young adult. Paolo (who ages to become Kevin Bacon) has become a police detective who is much better with his work than he is with a personal life spinning out of control (he continuously gets strange phone calls from his wife who has left him with little explanation). Soon the three childhood friends are brought back together when Penn's oldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) is found murdered near their home in a park. Simultaneously Robbins (who is not all there mentally obviously) comes home one dark and cold night covered in blood and having a rather deep cut in the middle of his gut. Wife Marcia Gay Harden is really worried about what may have occurred. Robbins tells her a story of a botched mugging and a fearsome street-fight between himself and an unknown assailant. However news of the event never hits the papers and Harden begins to wonder if Robbins may have had something to do with the gruesome murder of Rossum. While all this happens Bacon and fellow detective Laurence Fishburne are trying to solve the case. Emotions start to run high as Penn becomes suspicious of Rossum's secret boyfriend (Tom Guiry) and Robbin's bruised hand raises more questions. Guiry, who is constantly seen around the neighborhood with his younger mute brother (Spencer Tracy Clark), has always been on Penn's short list due to Guiry's father's mysterious past. And as all this transpires Penn's wife/Rossum's stepmother/Harden's cousin (Laura Linney) tries to be the rock that the entire family desperately needs while Harden herself starts to unravel emotionally. Penn, still hanging around with miscreants Kevin Chapman, Adam Nelson and Robert Wahlberg (all brothers), begins to let anger overtake his sorrow and you wonder what is really going on in his chaotic mind. 'Mystic River' is probably Clint Eastwood's finest film (acting or directing). He has his finger not only on the Brian Helgeland (who also adapted 'L.A. Confidential') script, but also on the landmark performances across the board. As good as everyone is, Penn (who is on another plateau from most other actors right now in his career) and Robbins are the ones who end up making you feel very cold and tense throughout. They both give their finest performances in this intimate and emotional character study. The movie never lets up its grip and then has a surprising ending that will give you chill bumps on top of chill bumps. 'Mystic River' never quite reached perfection with me, but its elements are something that are truly remarkable in this day of silly explosions and stupid screenplays in motion pictures.

A Beautiful Mind," The Most Dominant Best Picture Winner in Years.
","'A Beautiful Mind' is easily the finest best picture winner since 'Titanic' and was a dominant movie during a year where several films could have been honored just as easily. John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe in an Oscar-nominated performance) comes to Princeton in 1947 determined to make a name for himself in the complicated science of mathematics. The young mathematician struggles though as his mind and body are consumed with theories and amazingly complicated formulas. The torture and hard work do pay off eventually as Nash comes up with a game theory which leads to bigger and better things. Fast-forward a few years and now Nash is continuing research at Princeton, teaching and falling in love with one of his students (Oscar-winner Jennifer Connelly). All seems to be going well until he is approached one day by a mysterious government agent (Ed Harris in a cryptic performance). Now Nash is doing top-secret work as he becomes immersed in code-breaking to stem the tide of communism against the Russians. But 'A Beautiful Mind' goes much, much, much deeper than that. The film takes a dramatic turn during its mid-point and the subject turns 180 degrees as Nash is diagnosed with schizophrenia which causes paranoia and skewers what is reality and what is reality to John Nash. What then follows is a story about mental illness and the complications which accompany that sickness to those affected and those who care for those who are affected. John Nash becomes a could-have-been mathematician then as he is placed in a mental health institution in the 1950s where he must go through intense insulin-injected electro-shock therapy and then must take medications to fight his illness. The medications destroy Nash's ability to think properly and affects his physical demeanor as well. Nash then takes it upon himself to stop the medications and try to use his mind to cope with his illness. While Nash does somewhat succeed in that regard, it is his beautiful heart and the love and support of those closest to him that enable Nash to continue his work and eventually receive the Nobel Prize for his Game Theory in 1994. Of course all of this is based on a true story and the real John Nash still teaches today at Princeton. The film is a Hollywood project though as it has become apparent that the film-makers took many liberties to tell this important story. 'A Beautiful Mind' is director Ron Howard's (Oscar-winning) masterpiece by a mile. Very few could have directed this film with the style and dignity that Howard displayed. This movie was all shot in chronological order, a rare feat by any director. The Oscar-winning screenplay by Akiva Goldsmith proved to be the really important thing that made the film work as well as it did. This is the best film hands down dealing with the subject of mental illness (I do not consider 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' a film about this topic because I question whether or not Jack Nicholson's character really had anything wrong with him mentally). However, I must warn all that the scene leading up to Nash's insulin-injected electro-shock therapy and the treatment itself are disturbing sequences that are difficult to get through. The film achieved a PG-13 rating, but those scenes could have warranted an R just as easily. All the aforementioned performances are super and Judd Hirsch and Christoper Plummer (who has an imperative role that basically explains all that happens) both give excellent supporting turns, but this is Crowe's show as he gives his greatest performance to date. Excellent film from an excellent cinematic year. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,5,1 April 2002

Pitt and Jolie are an unhappily married couple who are both really government assassins who have hidden their true lives from one another. Amazing to me that these two experts could not know the real truth about their marriage.

Anyway the secrets hit the fan, chaos strikes and the chemistry between our two leads hits a fevered pitch that makes you ignore the stupid story all together. Comic relief from scene stealers Vince Vaughn (as Pitt's most trusted ally) and enigmatic wise-crack Adam Brody (of 'The O.C.' fame) become two more unnecessary distractions that ultimately lead nowhere. Brody gets immersed in the middle of the entire dizzying exercise as finding him becomes a top priority for the star duo. 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is like being in a high school and watching the senior quarterback and head cheerleader date. At times their routine may be cute or endearing and at other times you want to strangle them both because of their sickening relationship together. To say that Pitt and Jolie do not have a heated chemistry on the screen would be an outright lie, but honestly this is nothing but a whole lot of noise that represents a bare minimum of cinematic thought. Kind of like a science lab exploding and no one really caring. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,5,11,22 June 2005
The Departed," Say Cheese!!!---Rat Traps.
","Director Martin Scorsese gets back to the seamy mean streets of metropolitan America after a decade-long hiatus that took place after 'Casino' was released in 1995 with this fiery and mean-spirited masterpiece that focuses on double agents attempting to infiltrate the inner-most sectors of those very groups they want to take down. Matt Damon is the bad guy in deep with the Massachusetts State Police and Leonardo DiCaprio is our hero who may drown in an abyss of crime and wrongdoings with sadistic Irish Mafia crime boss Jack Nicholson. We have law enforcement officials galore (Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen), evil henchmen (led by Ray Winstone) and even a female element (in psychiatrist Vera Farmiga, who gets torn between Damon and DiCaprio herself) in the tangled and winding mixture. William Monahan's script rises above most all other film noir-styled classics of the genre mainly due to the overwhelming star-power (led by Nicholson in arguably his best role since 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest') and of course Scorsese's out of this world talents as a legendary American film-maker. Fast-moving, tense and devastatingly brilliant in most every way, 'The Departed' is easily one of Scorsese's finest efforts and quite possibly the best film of 2006.

Glory Road," Bounce the Basketball Slowly.
","The true story of the Texas Western University Miners (now called the University of Texas at El Paso) who defied all odds in 1966 by being the first NCAA basketball team to start five African-American players (led by Derek Luke of 'Antwone Fisher' and Mehchad Brooks of 'Desperate Housewives' fame) and ultimately winning the national championship. New coach Don Haskins (played superbly by Josh Lucas, one of the most under-rated actors in film right now) has trouble recruiting when he first arrives, but finds players in places like Detroit and Brooklyn. In the civil rights torn south though, getting African-American ball players was highly controversial and even potentially dangerous. It ends up being fitting that the team would meet up with Adolph Rupp (impressive transformation as usual for Jon Voight) and his University of Kentucky Wildcats for the championship that year as UK was one of the last major colleges to integrate its basketball team. Socially important story and highly educational for youngsters who may not be familiar with the importance of this stage in contemporary U.S. and sports history.

Psycho," Definitive Hitchcock.
","The definitive film from Hitchcock's library that just does not age at all. It is probably more terrifying and disturbing now than it was over 40 years ago. Janet Leigh (Oscar-nominated) seems like an ordinary woman, but she has a few skeletons in her closet: she is having an affair with a married man and she takes it upon herself to take a large sum of money from the bank where she works. A frantic getaway is now the only option, but the weather impedes her progress. Maybe a stay in the Bates Motel is what she needs. Enter suspicious inn-keeper Anthony Perkins and his unseen elderly mother who torments him. Trouble awaits for Leigh now. Sister Vera Miles becomes worried after Leigh's disappearance and Leigh's boyfriend also joins the search (John Gavin). The search leads to the spooky Bates Motel and the suspense builds. Private investigator Martin Balsam also joins the search but no one's safety is assured. Hitchcock is in top-form here all the way. The film is tense and it wraps itself around the audience. Definitely trail-blazing and definitely a classic, 'Psycho' is one of the cinema's best productions from any era. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,5,10,8 June 2002
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Weapons of Mass Destruction.
","College freshman Shia LaBeouf appears to be on his way to a normal life after the events of the original, but soon his mind is entranced with strange Egyptian symbols which hold the key for the Decepticons to use the sun as energy needed to take over the planet. Hit-and-miss sequel does basically accomplish what its predecessor did with non-stop action mixing with would-be witty one-liners, beautiful women, and sleek technologies. With all that said, 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' still lacks the complexities and depth of legitimate film-making vehicles to be much of a movie from a critical standpoint. Director Michael Bay would rather get thoughts across with confusing action sequences and seemingly unending chaos which often becomes more tiring and migraine-inducing than thought-provoking and interesting. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,6,19 July 2011
Rosemary's Baby," Hell Cometh As a Child.
","The first horror film that dealt directly with Satan instead of some conjured up manifestation was Roman Polanski's atmospheric and highly disturbing 'Rosemary's Baby'. A film that definitely paved the way for other great horror films of the next 20 years or so (most notably the superior 'The Exorcist' and the equal 'The Omen'). A young couple (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) has moved to an apartment in New York City. Everything seems fine, but the elderly next-door neighbors (played by Oscar-winning scene-stealer Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) seem a bit strange. Soon more elderly people start hanging around and after a very odd dream Farrow becomes pregnant. It seems that Cassavetes is the father of course, but the audience knows much better. The most unholy one of all has come up from the fires of Hell and impregnated Farrow in reality. Now the tension builds as Farrow is guarded by her husband and elderly friends as they all try to keep the real truth from her. Polanski's tone is the real thing that keeps 'Rosemary's Baby' highly entertaining and very difficult to sit through at the same time. The finale is a bit of a let-down to some (including myself to an extent), but overall the film does enough good things to become a cinematic horror classic. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,30 October 2002
War of the Worlds," Close Encounters of the Unkind.
","Director Steven Spielberg's ode to the H.G.

Tense science fiction thriller that works due to Spielberg's excellent direction and out-of-this-world visual effects. The performers are adequate, but are not really the film's primary calling card. Tim Robbins has a short appearance as a bunkered survivalist who attempts to help Cruise and company. Robbins' part could be looked upon as an unnecessary distraction or a creative side-story to the production's happenings. Undertones aplenty here for educated viewers who are up to speed on affairs in the world today. Spooky narration by Morgan Freeman at the start and end is a smart way to let the audience know and understand where the film is going and has been.

All Quiet on the Western Front," The First Truly Great Movie Ever Produced
","'All Quiet on the Western Front' is important filmmaking that still rings true today.  The film deals with World War I combat through the eyes of the enemy (the Germans).  For the first time ever it was realized how heartbreaking war really is, for all involved.  One key message within the film is that innocence cannot survive on the battlefield.  War is an awful thing that has no true winners, just losers.  Brilliant performances from all involved make the film believable and accurate for the most part.  A very young Lew Ayres is the best as his story creates tension for the entire film.  This is perhaps the first film that proved that the cinema could be a truly imperative medium.  The film was scorned by many in the U.S. as some thought that showing the Germans as sympathetic characters was in poor taste.  Germans hated the film because of its anti-war message.  Hitler was about to become a world power and he wanted all Germans to be excited and enthusiastic about combat.  This film goes against those ideals.  The Academy was brave enough and smart enough to award the film with the Best Picture Oscar in 1930 and Lewis Milestone became the first multiple Oscar winner in the directing category.  'All Quiet on the Western Front' has the storyline of Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' and the action and drama of Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'.  An overwhelming film experience.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,100,145,26 January 2001
Love Actually," Six Degrees of Separation and Excellence.
","There has long been a thought that we were all separated by six degrees. In other words, we are only a few people away from knowing more people and then more people and ultimately the entire world is connected as one perfect whole. 'Love Actually' is a wonderful, witty, whimsy, funny, dramatic, smart, intelligent, heartbreaking, heartwarming and life-affirming tale by first time director Richard Curtis (who also wrote) that is easily the finest film of its type ever made. In present-day England a seemingly endless cast of characters are all connected in one way or another in a wild and frantic 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Traffic' style that is truly remarkable. New British Prime Minister Hugh Grant (who could best be described as the anti-Tony Blair) immediately falls in love with curvy secretary Martine McCutcheon. McCutcheon happens to be neighbors with the super-sexy Heike Makatsch, a temp at a company business who is trying to seduce her new boss (the always good Alan Rickman). He may actually take the bait, but the big problem is that he is married to wife Emma Thompson (who is also Grant's little sister). Thompson has not been paying attention to Rickman's change because she has been consoling friend Liam Neeson after his wife passes away of a long illness. Their relationship is strictly platonic, but still loving. Neeson's young stepson (the priceless Thomas Sangster) has his first taste of puppy love with a girl his age (newcomer Olivia Olson) from America who could best be described as a 10-year-old reincarnation of Beyonce Knowles. Still more connections follow as seductress Makatsch is actually dating artist Andrew Lincoln. Lincoln though has no feelings for Makatsch and vice versa as he has shyly fallen in love with Keira Knightley (who has had a breakthrough year if ever there was one). The love is quiet and from afar though as Lincoln just happens to be best friends with Knightley's new husband (Chiwetel Ejiofor). Thus Lincoln acts like he does not like Knightley when she is around to curb his true feelings towards her. One of Knightley's friends (Colin Firth, another constant stand-out) attends her wedding, but is shocked to find his live-in girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) having sex with his brother (Dan Fredenburgh) when he returns home. Firth, a writer, is heartbroken and feels that he must get away for a while. He goes to a French villa that he owns and immediately falls in love with Portuguese house-keeper Lucia Moniz. The only problem is: they have no clue of what the other is saying. Thus Firth has fallen in love with her and she with him, but they do not know the other's true feelings through their words. When Moniz has to return to her homeland, will Firth be able to forget about her and vice versa? Of course we all hope not. And still more goes on. Two adult film stars (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page) have no trouble simulating sex, but have a real issue with intimacy. They both slowly find they have more in common than their jobs and discover a love that is hard for each to express. Freeman also happens to be friends with Ejiofor and thus another connection is created. American Laura Linney, who works for Rickman, has fallen in love with oblivious co-worker Rodrigo Santoro. It actually seems that the duo may find love with one another, but Linney constantly gets phone calls from her mentally unstable brother (the committed Michael Fitzgerald) and feels an obligation to take care of him and let her own wants take a backseat. The fact that their parents have passed away has left Linney lonely and driven Fitzgerald crazy. An under-sexed young adult Kris Marshall (who worked at Knightley's wedding) comes to the conclusion that he is an erotic love machine (even though he has had no luck with women). He gets it in his mind that the problem is not him, but British women. Thus he decides to go to America, to Wisconsin of all places (!?), to find beautiful girls. He surprisingly finds lots of them (Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert and Ivana Milicevic), but it is unclear what their motives with him really are. Everything gets a break with scene-stealer Bill Nighy (in an unforgettably excellent part) as a seemingly washed-up rock musician who has struggled with drug abuse in the past. He gets on the radio and in front of the camera and says anything that is on his wild mind. His thoughts are simply hilarious as well. Nighy about worries long-time manager Gregor Fisher to death with his unrehearsed antics. There is also department store worker Rowan Atkinson (of 'Mr. Bean' fame) who continues to quietly play a key role in the happenings. Oh and let's not forget uncomplimentary U.S. presidential caricature Billy Bob Thornton (just imagine the worst things about Bill Clinton and George W. Bush mixed together to form the worst world leader you have ever seen) and his short appearance with prime minister Grant and secretary McCutcheon. Whew. 'Love Actually' pushes the envelope on being the smartest screenplay I have ever encountered. Richard Curtis (best known for writing the 'Mr. Bean' series and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral') is able to go beyond his musings. The reason? Curtis is an amazingly gifted director (I really did not think he would be as successful in this regard). The movie is a lot deeper than it appears on the surface. References to 9-11 early on and the Grant/Thornton characters show Curtis' disgust with British and American affairs today. The film preaches love and not war and ends up being an angry commentary to involvement in Iraq. This movie quietly becomes an anti-war film on par with monumental pictures like 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon' and 'The Thin Red Line'. It is no secret that I have been disappointed all year with motion pictures, but 'Love Actually' is superior enough to raise the level of 2003 as a whole. This is truly beyond excellence. I love this picture and it touched my heart, mind and soul. There are not many films in a lifetime that will do that to you. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,5,6 February 2004
Wedding Crashers," Crash Into Me.........and Me........and Me...........and Me.........and Me.........
","Uproariously hilarious and dominant over-achiever that is going to stand tall with the better films of 2005. Two divorce attorneys (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) take advantage of the summer season by literally going to weddings and posing as friends and/or relatives of total strangers to get access to red hot young women who have love on their minds. When they go to a wedding for the daughter of a popular politician (Christopher Walken), the Beavis & Butt-Head duo use their usual assets and antics to gain access to the high-class Maryland family's home. Wilson falls hard for one of Walken's daughters (Rachel McAdams of 'The Notebook' fame who is engaged to super jerk Bradley Cooper) while Vaughn unwittingly becomes the one true love of Walken's youngest girl (a show-stopping, out of this world role for Isla Fisher). Wilson, falling in love for the first time in his life, does his best to stay as long as he can while Vaughn does everything in his power to get away from the demented Fisher. Wonderful turns abound by cameo actors and supporting performers (led by Jane Seymour, Henry Gibson, Keir O'Donnell and Ellen Albertini Dow) are right on target as the film uses strong momentum early and then when the story almost falls to plot resolutions late, a crazed twist keeps the entire project on its fast track. So many great moments (and super lovely ladies) make 'Wedding Crashers' one of the most memorable and remarkable comedies of the last few years. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,2,5,3 August 2005

Burlesque," All That Glitters Is Not Always Gold.
","Since the advent of sound and the first Best Picture Oscar winner in the sound era (1929 winner 'The Broadway Melody'), Hollywood has been fascinated with the musical and namely the 'small-town girl has huge dreams in the big city' genre. The 2010 version of this sometimes-proved formula gives us 'Burlesque', a film that wants to continue the trends of 'Moulin Rouge!' and 'Chicago', but looks more like the genre when it was fleeting through the 1970s and 1980s with that Bob Fosse take on the material. Christina Aguilera is that small-town Iowa girl (!?) who comes up with the idea out of the blue one day to leave the simple Midwest life for Los Angeles. Times are tough though as she has no luck until she wanders aimlessly into a nightclub that has the feel of Fosse's 'Cabaret'. There she encounters the club's owner and creative force (bravura role for Cher, doing her best work in two decades) and a whole array of fascinating characters (namely love interest/bartender Cam Gigandet and the scene-stealing Stanley Tucci). Inside the club, the typical soap operas play out with Aguilera wanting to be a star, Cher having her doubts, Cher's ex-husband Peter Gallagher worrying about the club's enormous debt, Aguilera having a rivalry with star attraction Kristen Bell, big-money sleaze-ball Eric Dane eyeing the club and many of the female performers for himself, Gigandet's long-distance relationship with fiancé Dianna Agron, and even an unplanned pregnancy via role player Julianne Hough, and so on. In the end there is nothing just earth-shattering here, but there is still something about this film that makes it pop nevertheless. The musical numbers and dance sequences can be looked upon as exciting or downright tiring, but the women do sizzle and keep the audience and intensity up throughout. Relative film-making newcomer Steve Antin (who directed the film and wrote the screenplay) shows kind of an intense MTV-styled 1980s consciousness which likely comes from his hay-day acting career during that decade (being in films such as 'The Goonies' and 'The Accused'). Is the film successful in its goals? I think in this case it is up to the viewer and ultimately there were enough pluses for 'Burlesque' to be one of the more guiltier pleasures of the past few years. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,29 December 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," Sometimes Silence Speaks Volumes.
","A small-town lawyer (Gregory Peck, Oscar-winning) defends a young black man accused of rape in depression-era Alabama in this outstanding and thought-provoking motion picture. Peck tries to show his two young children (one Oscar-nominated Mary Badham) that prejudice has no place in a world that we all share together. He also proves that the way a person looks does not show who the person really is inside. Robert Mulligan (Oscar-nominated) finally found his niche as a director as he had struggled throughout his career with interesting, but somewhat obscure productions that never found a cinematic audience. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was vastly important for 1962 America as racial unrest and the Civil Rights Movement dominated the headlines. The film is a smart production that stood very tall against other competition from the year of its release ('Lawrence of Arabia' and 'The Longest Day') and still stands tall as one of the finest films the American cinema has ever developed. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,0,3,12 December 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Bridge Built to History.
","Before director David Lean (Oscar-winning) made 'Lawrence of Arabia' in 1962, he created arguably the best film of the 1950s with 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. The film is an intense World War II epic about a group of British POWs (led by Oscar-winner Alec Guinness) who are forced by the Japanese Military (led by Oscar-nominee Sessue Hayakawa) to build a railway bridge to assist the Axis Powers. Naturally Guinness, by the book all the way, tries to get out of the job by debating and using British wit. All that falls on deaf ears though as the bridge will be made. Guinness then decides to show that England is the greatest country on Earth by building the finest bridge possible. As all this goes on, American William Holden has been assigned to lead a group of troops into the jungle and destroy the bridge before it can transport supplies and troops for the enemy. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is an excellent film that shows the best of the 1950s. The 1950s were great cinematically because of large budgets and amazing spectacles. This film has that but is better than most other productions of the period due to top-notch writing, directing and out-of-this-world performances. Alec Guinness (best known for 'Star Wars') had his greatest performance here. His character unwittingly becomes a willing ally to the enemy and starts to develop a subtle type of war fatigue that will directly affect all the other key players within the film's vast landscape.

Man on Fire," Like a Horrific Blaze, the Film Goes Up in Smoke.
","A washed-up former Marine (Denzel Washington) with a terrible drinking problem and haunted by demons due to mistakes made in his past goes down to Mexico City to be a bodyguard to a young girl (Dakota Fanning). It seems that her well-to-do parents (Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell) are scared to death of the recent surge in kidnappings within the city and are desperate to keep their daughter safe. Naturally Washington keeps himself at an arm's length from all those around him until Fanning is able to break his shell with her youthful kindness, friendliness and non-judgmental nature. An unmistakable bond develops between the two and when the duo is ambushed and Fanning is taken by a group of thugs (and Washington nearly killed himself), the only solution is for Washington to go after every individual that may have had something to do with the tragedy. Thus his old cold and menacing ways come back in full force in a 'I'm gonna get you!'-styled revenge ploy. 'Man on Fire' starts out well and hits a good stride when Washington and Fanning's relationship comes shining through, but her disappearance sends shock-waves to a production that was already walking dangerous territory. Director Tony Scott would rather dazzle with crazed camera shots and distracting elements like giving English subtitles when the characters are actually speaking English than going for the throat with character development and story background. The movie is literally on fire it seems as the entire screenplay (adapted by Brian Helgeland, who has done much better work with triumphs like 'L.A. Confidential' and 'Mystic River') thrives on chaos rather than coherence. Really the movie makes less sense as it progresses. Washington does all he can in the mess, but Fanning is truly the only notable point in the film (she helped turn 'I Am Sam' into a minor success by splitting time with Sean Penn). When she is taken out of the picture, a tail-spin occurs that cannot be stopped. Good actors like Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Tioctin and Giancarlo Giannini get lost in a dizzying maze of loud and empty film-making techniques. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,3,6,2 June 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson Finally Wins the Oscar
","Jack Nicholson had been nominated four times, he had lost four times.  Each time he probably should have won, but he never did.  Just when you thought there was no justice in the world, Jack finally came through with 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.  The film is exceptional in every sense imaginable. Nicholson stars as a prisoner who is sent to an insane asylum.  While there, Nicholson creates an atmosphere which gives his fellow inmates a sense of self-worth and a glimmer of happiness.  Throughout, it is never made clear whether Nicholson is truly insane or just acting crazy to get out of manual labor at the regular prison.  Whatever the case, Nicholson is creating a place that head-nurse Louise Fletcher (Oscar-winning) is finding unsuitable for the other patients.  She is quietly evil and amazingly cruel to those within the asylum.  Nicholson and Fletcher are getting ready for a head-on-collision that will prove to be the decisive factor at the end of the movie.

What follows is a maddening, psychotic, and hellish view of a land that was literally held hostage for a decade by a power-hungry madman who left his imprint on the entire world. Wonderfully realized nervous masterpiece by British director Christopher McDonald who keeps the whole thing going at a fast and dizzying pace with wild camera shots and lightening strong editing techniques. Kerry Washington (best known as Jamie Foxx's wife in 'Ray') shines as one of Whitaker's wives and David Oyelowo is particularly memorable as a native doctor to Uganda.

Bram Stoker's Dracula," Interesting and Mostly Accurate Take on the Horror Classic.
","'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is one of those films that reeled people in by making its audience believe that it would be an intense horror film on par with productions like 'Rosemary's Baby' or 'The Exorcist'. Instead, director Francis Ford Coppola stayed more true to Stoker's novel and put a focus on an intense love story that transcends time, the elements and even life and death. This naturally turned off many horror enthusiasts who would rather see a film that thrives on shock value rather than a movie that thrives on heart, brains and emotion. The film is naturally about the titled character, an immortal man (played superbly by the nearly always exceptional Gary Oldman) who has turned against God and now lives through the powers of darkness. By the late-19th Century, the titled character is trying to lure back a reincarnation of his one true love (Winona Ryder) and of course attempting to eliminate all those that might stand in his way (Ryder's fiance Keanu Reeves and professor Anthony Hopkins most notably). Overall 'Dracula' is an amazingly good looking film that benefits from high production values and guaranteed performances (mainly from Oldman and Hopkins). Coppola's direction is strong, but a bit overbearing at times and sometimes it is unclear what the tone of the production truly is. Watch for Italian beauty Monica Bellucci as one of Oldman's beautiful, but deadly wives. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,122,195,18 April 2003

In 1970s San Diego, California the titled character (Will Ferrell) and his local team of fellow anchors (Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell and David Koechner) ignore important news in favor of stupid events like pet shows and pregnant panda bears.

","Whether it is fair to compare this film with 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a question up for debate.  However, since there is no decision on that topic I am going to make the comparison.  'The Green Mile' is a long way from 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  This film deals with a massive death row inmate in 1935 Louisiana played by Michael Clarke Duncan (in an Oscar nominated performance) who is charged with the murders of two small girls.  It is clear from the start that this man is not evil or dangerous at all, in fact he is blessed with the power to heal.  The supernatural aspect of this movie turned me off almost immediately.  It seemed that writer-producer-director Frank Darabont was going for something between 'The Shawshank Redemption' and one of Stephen King's other novels that dealt with supernatural phenomena.  The result is a film that is uneven in many respects, in spite of the fact that it is very well made.  Tom Hanks does nothing to help out the problem as he gives his weakest performance in years.  William Sadler and Gary Sinise have such little screen time that one barely even notices them.  Everyone else just seems to be along for the ride.  Duncan is the revelation.  He keeps a questionable screenplay above water and holds the audience's attention for most of the 3 hours and 7 minutes.  That's another drawback, this film is way too long.  I think that 30 minutes could have been deleted and the end product would have still been the same.  A very considerate 4 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,2,25 June 2000
Jaws," The Ultimate Popcorn Movie
","'Jaws' is a thrill-ride of suspense that continues to deliver the goods to the audience 25 years later.  The plot is somewhat thin: a large shark is terrorizing the tourists at the local beach.  However, with that said Steven Spielberg's direction is amazing.  The young director (only 28 at the time) showed unlimited potential that would only increase with age.  A great accomplishment that could have been a multi-million dollar bust.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,89,166,1 September 2000
The Wrestler," Wrestling With Life and One's Self.
","Bleak, dark, and arguably empty piece from young gifted director Darren Aronofsky (best known for 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream') focuses on the potential fleeting last professional days of the titled character (Mickey Rourke, definitely looking much different from his hay-day of the 1980s). Rourke is a has-been who seems to have found ways in every direction to mess up his life, whether it be with steroid use, over-drinking, his somewhat indifferent attitude towards women, or his acutely strained relationship (or lack thereof) with adult daughter Evan Rachel Wood. Also along for the demoralizing trip is over-the-hill lap dancer Marisa Tomei who just seems to be the kind of girl who would get mixed up in the titled character's pathetic existence. 'The Wrestler' is one of those pictures which works in downward cycles. Just when you think there is going to be a redeeming and uplifting moment in the film, the characters find a way to mess it up. In short, the movie examines the extreme foibles and miscues of people who just seem destined to underachieving and sometimes ultimate failure. Overall, the film keeps the audience interested in spite of itself. The world of wrestling becomes a boring and almost completely unnecessary footnote as over-pumped boneheads have jam sessions choreographing their upcoming bouts. The sport does not generate much enthusiasm and its use here was meant to prove a point which is never fully realized. Over-hyped and way over-praised. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,29 April 2009
Dark Shadows," Ends Up Needing More Than Just a Blood Transfusion.
","Schizophrenic underachiever that markets itself as a unique and appealing comedy on the level of perhaps 'Being There' as long-deceased and cursed vampire Johnny Depp awakens in 1972 Maine with typically well-calculated and hilarious results. However, Tim Burton's unfocused, mean-spirited, and oft-times confusing direction derails what should have been the film's premise with surprisingly dark and disturbing sequences, a distracting love triangle between Depp, his true love Bella Heatchcote (in a yawner of a role), and the super-sexy Eva Green (arguably hitting a new note for even her on the heat meter) who doubles as a witch and a cutthroat businesswoman of canned foods (no kidding), and waning attempts of possible character redemptions. Also along for the ride is the always under-rated Helena Bonham Carter as a frazzled psychiatrist, 1972 family matriarch Michelle Pfeiffer (woefully lost and miscast here), and cameos by horror veterans like Jackie Earle Haley, Christoper Lee, and even Alice Cooper. Definitely would have worked better as a long skit ala something from 'Saturday Night Live' or even perhaps a sitcom, uneven elements turn a possible winner into another in the long line of ho-hum releases from the sometimes brilliant, but sometimes negatively outlandish Burton. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,2,6 June 2012

He falls in love with a cynical gossip page writer (Eva Mendes) who also appears to know much about relationships, but is alone as well.

Ray," And the Blind Shall See.
","Very excellent biopic about the life of musician/pianist Ray Charles (Jamie Foxx in easily one of the finest performances in the history of the cinema). From his early career in rainy Seattle in the late-1940s to international acclaim in the mid-1960s, Charles' life is told with the subtlety of an iron pipe beating against solid concrete. Throughout, we see flashbacks to his (C.J. Sanders) youth in post-depression era Florida. Growing up among sharecroppers in poverty, the titled character would lose his younger brother (Terrone Bell) in a freak accident and ultimately his eyesight within the course of a year. He is taught to go beyond his potential shortcoming by mother Sharon Warren (in a pivotally crucial role) and by the time he is a teenager he is working as a small-time piano player in the Pacific Northwest. Time passes and Charles slowly gains notoriety via deals with Atlantic Records (run by Curtis Armstrong who is best known for 'Risky Business' and 'The Revenge of the Nerds' series and 'West Wing' alum Richard Schiff). He also meets the love of his life (Kerry Washington) as he stands on the threshold of super-stardom. Success and childhood demons haunt the talent throughout though as extra-marital affairs (with backup singers Aunjanue Ellis and Regina King) and a near-crippling addiction to heroin threaten to destroy everything Charles has achieved. And do not forget that all this transpires during a time when this nation was struggling with civil rights and segregation issues (and of course Charles' song 'Georgia' added to that heated controversy). Amazingly dominant film where every character has their moment and of course Foxx reaches unearthly heights. Director Taylor Hackford (best known for hit-and-miss soap operas like 'An Officer and a Gentleman' and 'White Nights') has a unique grasp on this story. He uses his obvious talent to tell stories that are enhanced by their soundtracks to humanize a well-known entertainer that few of us ever really knew. The music soars, but this is not the surprise in 'Ray'. Instead the real surprise is the depth, development and genuine importance of this tale.

Inception," And the Mind Makes a Movie.
","One of the ultimate mind-twisters/mind-benders in cinematic history, 'Inception' is a complete and total triumph of concept and creativity. Corporate raider Leonardo DiCaprio is able, with the help of others, to invade the subconscious of unaware persons in the hopes of stealing invaluable business data for competitors. However, a new assignment (via the mysterious Ken Watanabe) comes forth which calls for DiCaprio to actually plant an idea into the would-be victim's subconscious to make it appear that individual came up with the concept originally himself. In this circumstance the victim is Cillian Murphy (who is haunted by his relationship, or lack thereof, with late father Pete Postlethwaite) as DiCaprio and his team (led by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page) attempt to perform what the movie makes appear to be highly dangerous and nearly impossible to pull off successfully. Subsequently, there are dilemmas aplenty with the most major one being DiCaprio's memories of late wife Marion Cotillard which seem to constantly pop-up and consume his dream-time missions. Ultimately, the film's journey through the mind will subsequently be an excursion into the human heart, spirit, and soul as well via dreams within dreams within dreams (and possibly even more dreams within dreams). Just as writer/director Christopher Nolan (I think arguably the finest film-maker in the world today) paid homage to modern film noir directors Martin Scorsese and Michael Mann with the stunning 'The Dark Knight' back in 2008, he does the same to more great movie men like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, Terrence Malick, and David Lynch with 'Inception'. Shades of '2001: A Space Odyssey' are the easiest and most apparent comparisons which can be ascertained as Nolan does the near-impossible balancing act of keeping the audience at an arm's length while simultaneously pulling them into the story from the outset and keeping us on the edges of our seats. Sure, the special effects are monumental along with the technical aspects of set design, editing, and cinematography, but these elements are not going to be the reasons why 'Inception' will have long-lasting staying power. The points of directing, vision, and screen writing (along with vastly under-rated performances from the aforementioned players all the way down to character roles for Tom Berenger and Michael Caine) will destine 'Inception' to be one of those movies which will never lose its luster or glitter. One of the finest films ever conceived. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,9,23 July 2010
The Terminal," Sometimes You Find Good Things in the Most Unlikely Places.
","An Eastern European (Tom Hanks) from a fictional country literally gets stuck at JFK Airport in New York after his landing coincides with the point at which a war causes his nation to no longer exist. Thus his paperwork and passport are no good. Hanks is in the U.S. for a mysterious reason and that reason becomes the hook in this wonderful picture. While stuck, Hanks sees more of America than he could have ever imagined. However he constantly has trouble with airport supervisor Stanley Tucci (in a perfect role). Runway worker Diego Luna makes a deal with Hanks so he can learn about passport officer Zoe Saldana (a woman who Luna has loved from afar) via Hanks' attempts to have his passport accepted. Also Hanks meets an elderly Indian janitor (Kumar Pallana) who has been in the states for decades, but the reason he is there also becomes a key point. While all this goes on, Hanks falls in love with 30-something flight attendant Catherine Zeta-Jones (perfectly illuminating and beautiful as usual). Zeta-Jones is sad and disillusioned with men (Michael Nouri of 'Flashdance' in particular) and past relationships that have failed for one reason or another. Director Steven Spielberg has never really been known for romantic pictures ('Always' in 1989 is an exception), but he proves that he can definitely handle a production like this. The cast is excellent with Hanks making all those around him better. This story was co-written by Andrew Niccol (even though he strangely did not pen the final script), an under-rated screenwriter who struck gold in 1998 with 'The Truman Show'. Many of the good things from that script are also presented here in diverse and creative ways. By the way, the art direction/set decoration is amazing as everything within the titled location was built from scratch in a studio. Spielberg was not allowed to film any airports due to obvious security reasons. From top to bottom, 'The Terminal' flies high. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,157,220,23 July 2004

A banker who protests his innocence after his wife and her lover are killed befriends a group of prisoners and changes everyone's life for the better.  It does not sound that great to most people, but when you see this film you will honestly come away loving every frame of it.  Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is greater, and the supporting cast are all perfect.  William Sadler, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows stand out as well.  James Whitmore, who has been in acting since the 1940s, gives his best performance as Brooks and should have at least received an Oscar nod.  If you haven't seen this film go and see it.  I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch on a rainy afternoon, or at anytime for that matter.

Platoon," Oliver Stone's Haunting Vietnam Masterpiece
","There has been much debate about what was the best film of the 1980s. 'Platoon' deserves real consideration. I don't think it was the best (I am partial to 'Raging Bull'), but 'Platoon' is easily in the top five of that decade. Writer-director Oliver Stone's experiences in Vietnam were the catalysts for this amazing masterpiece which won four Oscars in 1986, including the Best Picture of the year. Young Charlie Sheen experiences a year of hell as he witnesses atrocities and learns first-hand that innocence is the initial casualty of warfare. At the heart of 'Platoon' is the conflict between veteran sergeants Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe (both Oscar-nominated). Berenger is crazed and has distorted views about war. His twisted views will lead to conflict with peaceful and deep-thinking Willem Dafoe who acts as the voice of reason in a time and place of total chaos. Sheen, Berenger and Dafoe all have the best performances to date. They are solid in every way imaginable. Familiar faces like John C. McGinley, Keith David, Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon and Tony Todd are all perfect in limited, but important screen time.

Scream," Resurrection Boulevard.
","Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' series had run its course by 1996 and he needed some new material. While horror films rarely become creative, Craven decided to poke fun at the genre that he helped to make famous by the mid-1980s with 'Scream'. This is a silly slasher flick, but it knows what it is and does not try to get cute with crazed gimmicks. A town falls under siege as the teens start to be murdered by a person dressed in what is little more than a Halloween costume. Naturally the cops are no help (most notably David Arquette) and the media turns the whole thing into a gigantic circus (with Courtney Cox leading the way). Teens Neve Campbell, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard all try to figure out who the bad guy might be, but in the end twists and turns will occur that will surprise some and leave others feeling a bit empty. 'Scream' is not a bad film for the genre. In fact it is a near masterpiece compared to the 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' series of films. Craven, who struck gold with the original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', nearly accomplishes what he did some 12 years earlier when he revolutionized a sub-par cinematic group of films.

The evil Michael Myers is a masked and crazed slasher who will do anything to kill his little sister (a very young Jamie Lee Curtis).  It is never really explained why he is after her, but he is.  Psychiatrist Donald Pleasance is the expert who knows that Myers must be stopped.  Pleasance is solid (as he usually is in these films) and Curtis shows a glimmer of potential here.

As the public mourned, the royal family (led by Queen Elizabeth II, played to the summit by Helen Mirren) tried using quiet restraint in the hopes of letting a sad and difficult situation die away peacefully. However, the delicate situation leads to public disgust and disdain for the queen and her royal family as it appears they have no heart or emotion towards the 'People's Princess' as newly elected prime minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) gets caught in the middle. Quietly mundane and dignified would-be masterpiece that serves as a quirky and interesting part of contemporary history and doubles as a window into one of the really more mysterious figures in the world today.

Raging Bull," Scorsese's Best? De Niro's Best? The 1980s' Best? Probably on All Three
","'Raging Bull' is a cinematic masterpiece which pulls no punches.  Based on a true story, Robert De Niro (in his second Oscar-winning role) stars as Jake La Motta, a middle-weight prize-fighter from the late-1940s and early-1950s, who basically destroys himself and those around him because of an uncontrollable temper and poor decision-making.  Instead of going down as one of the greatest boxers of all time, La Motta ruined his career because he was unable to see the 'big picture'.  He threw bouts, he got involved with low-life underworld crime figures, he beat his wife (Cathy Moriarty, in her Oscar-nominated role), he abused all those closest to him, and he had relationships with young girls who were still considered minors.  Even his strongest tie, his younger brother (Joe Pesci, in an Oscar-nominated, star-making part), gets cut during the course of his untimely self-destruction.  La Motta goes from middle-weight champ to a washed-out stand-up comic at a local club.  He gains weight uncontrollably and ultimately just becomes another face in the crowd by the end of the film. By the end, La Motta proclaims that he: 'Could have been a contender....', quoting Marlon Brando's famous line from 'On the Waterfront'.  'Raging Bull' is one of those films that is masterfully crafted in all possible departments.  The screenplay is one of the best in the history of film. Martin Scorsese's direction is superb and so is the cinematography (shot almost entirely in black-and-white).  The film delivered De Niro an Oscar and also won for its editing.  'Raging Bull' is one of those films that is very close to 'Citizen Kane'.  They both deal with men who desperately want to be great, but ultimately destroy themselves and those around them.  This film is often rated the best film of the 1980s.  I cannot argue with that opinion.  I also think that this is the best work that Scorsese and De Niro have ever done.  The fact that this film lost the Best Picture Oscar to 'Ordinary People' in 1980 is probably the biggest disappointment since 'Citizen Kane' lost to 'How Green Was My Valley' in 1941.

The princess is to be rescued by an ogre and a wise-cracking donkey after being forced to by an evil king who has kicked all fairy tale creatures out of their land. But she does have a secret that few could have guessed and the film tries to warm the heart during its final act, but by that time it was nearly too late. 'Shrek' is one of those odd films that uses smoke and mirrors to make it seem a lot better than it really is. It is a good film, but to me it was much weaker than recent Disney films that have used similar animation techniques ('Toy Story', 'Toy Story 2', 'A Bug's Life'). Its story-telling is a bit out-there and that is the main problem I had with the film. It is also more adult-oriented as many children will not understand the gags and many adults will be turned off by some of the situations and dialogue.

The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of 'The Silence of the Lambs' are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.

Vanilla Sky," Thick Smog and Fog Ahead.
","Long, winding and ultimately pretentious and empty dud from director Cameron Crowe has New York publishing giant Tom Cruise recanting some odd events that took place just prior and after his 33rd birthday. Cruise, disfigured and imprisoned, tells a confusing story of lust and possibly love to prison psychiatrist Kurt Russell. It seems that lover Cameron Diaz snapped after finding out that Cruise was seeing new interest Penelope Cruz. A wild car ride for Cruise and Diaz would follow, but then everything after that is a gigantic fog of oddball situations and stranger outcomes (ala Stanley Kubrick's much better 'Eyes Wide Shut'). In the flashbacks we see Cruise's best friend (Jason Lee) and a strange ghostly character that keeps on popping up all over the place (scene-stealer Noah Taylor). Soon Cruise's reality and dreams mix into a whacked jumble where nothing is what it seems and eventually even the Cruz and Diaz characters seem to show similarities. 2001 was definitely the year for strange experiences at the movie house with 'Mulholland Dr.' and 'Memento'. 'Vanilla Sky' would like to be in the same category as those masterpieces, but ends up falling flat. The screenplay is all over the place and the resolution is predictable, unsatisfying and even a bit dumb. Cruise and Cruz have no chemistry at all in this film. They may be right for one another in real life, but they stink it up together on the silver screen (Cruise and former wife Nicole Kidman were so good together in movies).

The Dark Knight Rises," Epic Lessons From the Batman.
","Eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight', Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, aka Batman) must once again come to Gotham City's aid as a crazed masked terrorist known as Bane (Tom Hardy) terrorizes anyone and everyone in his demented path. A seductive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway) is also along for the maddening ride as biblical-styled destruction, atomic warfare, and even stock market tampering turn out to the most devastating orders for the day. Long, winding, and ultimately towering installment in co-writer/director Christopher Nolan's new-age 'Batman' trilogy is a triumph of vivid characterizations, advanced-styled story-telling principles, and wonderful technicalities such as cinematography, editing, sound, and visual effects. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines as a good cop caught up in the chaos; the same can be said for new love interest Marion Cotillard who makes an impression as an associate to Bale's Wayne Industries. Traditional standouts Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman also add well-timed and effective roles for the production's nearly three-hour running time. Once again, a great accomplishment of style, flair, and dynamics in a tightly-wound cinematic product which blends and meshes in well with its two predecessors of the dominant trilogy. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,3,6,26 July 2012
Any Given Sunday," Migraine Headache Movie That Could Have Only Been Made by Oliver Stone
","My goodness, 'Any Given Sunday' is like a lethal narcotic shot of a movie that will just about kill the normal viewer.  It runs an amazing 164 minutes and is just as wild and chaotic as 'Natural Born Killers'.  Stone tries to examine professional football teams by showing how fast and out-of-control the lifestyle of those involved are.  However instead of providing any drama or a real message, Stone goes for style over substance and ends up creating a movie that is little more than a nauseating sequence of crazy camera shots.  The cast is adequate, but is totally wasted due to Stone's overbearing, in-your-face style.  Overall a film, like 'Natural Born Killers', that only the greatest Oliver Stone fans will get anything out of other than a severe migraine headache.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,2,9 January 2001

","Over-exaggerated and over-wrought would-be superhero dynamic action thriller gets bogged down in a silly screenplay, sillier characters, and sophomoric direction by Jon Favreau. Extraordinary U.S. arms dealer Robert Downey, Jr. is captured by Afghan terrorists on their own turf and must escape by creating his alter ego---the titled character. Now he is a Captain America-styled modern-day freedom fighter who uses state of the art technology and high brow intelligence to fight the dreaded opposition. Jeff Bridges has a predictable role as Downey's would-be associate. Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard supply uninspired supporting roles who do nothing to advance the film's sporadic tone and helter-skelter approach.

Tombstone," Everything That 'Wyatt Earp' Wanted to Be
","'Tombstone' is one of the best westerns ever made. It was overshadowed in the early-1990s due to the success of 'Dances With Wolves' and 'Unforgiven'. While 'Tombstone' is not on par with either of those films, it is an exciting shoot-em-up western that works because it never tries to be more than it is. The Earps (Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, and Bill Paxton) are looking for their fortune out west. However, trouble ensues as ruthless cowboys are reigning terror all over the region. Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn are the leaders of the bad dudes and a massive showdown is the only answer for all concerned. Also along for the ride is Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, in arguably his greatest role). 'Tombstone' also has one of the greatest casts of recent memory.

Enter God himself (Morgan Freeman) as he makes a deal with the title character, giving him all his heavenly powers. Naturally goof-ball Carrey uses his new skills in the most moronic ways. Live-in girlfriend Jennifer Aniston worries that Carrey is losing interest in her and focusing too much on less important things. Sexy news anchor Catherine Bell (of 'JAG' fame) soon has her eye on Carrey after his unbelievable run of good luck. And of course no one knows that Freeman and Carrey have their little agreement. Problems arise all over the world due to Carrey's selfish use of his powers. In the end, can he fix the difficulties he has created? 'Bruce Almighty' is an economically heavy film that cost a small fortune to make, but no money was spent on the really important things. Carrey, who was so good in 'The Truman Show', continues to choose silly projects that only look at the bottom line. Aniston and Bell fit in good in a mess like this because they are basically just television performers and this production plays more like a sitcom than a motion picture. As for Freeman, I have no clue why he is in this thing. Wants to be a comedy, but toes delicate subject matter way too much to be very funny.

","Richard Dreyfuss received an Oscar nomination in 1995 as the title character, a man who decides to teach so he will have more time to write music and conduct.  Of course he learns real quick that teaching is time-consuming and that he has no extra time at all.  The plan to teach for a few years turns into a career and the audience gets to experience all of the teacher's ups (a son being born, learning to love his work, creating a top-notch music and arts department) and downs (learning his son is deaf, learning of the death of one of his former students in Vietnam, and learning that his department's funding will likely be cut, forcing him to retire before he wants to).  'Mr. Holland's Opus' works because of a great performance by Dreyfuss.  He makes everyone else in the film better as well (Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas, Olympia Dukakis, William H.

The 21st official entry in the long-running series that began with 'Dr. No' in 1962 will most be remembered for Craig's introduction as the famed British secret agent. Like fine wines, each installment has its pluses and minuses (as a rule more upside than down though) and this one is no exception. Craig, like every other man who has played Bond over the past 40 plus years, brings his own unique elements to the part.

And of course we have new characters and graphics to go with the new adventure. Impressive, but somewhat underwhelming third installment in the hugely popular computer-animated genre as the characters are still right on target (particularly those from the original installment) and the situations continue to be fun and interesting for most all age groups. With that said, the thrill and energy of the initial concept is slowly trickling away as the film-makers seem to be grasping at straws to feed hungry audiences who love these characters and concepts and keep the money machine rolling full-speed ahead.

Naturally the monsters change by stealing the talents of various other NBA stars (Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Tyrone Bogues, Larry Johnson and Shawn Bradley) and it is up to Bugs, Daffy and company to enlist the help of the greatest player ever---Jordan.

","Another M. Night Shyamalan film that tries to dazzle and then surprise you at the end. The routine still works to an extent, but overall Shyamalan is still living off his enormous success with 'The Sixth Sense'. Former religious man Mel Gibson, his wise-cracking younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and Gibson's two young children seem to have a relatively peaceful and uneventful lives in Pennsylvania. Peaceful that is until crop circles start appearing and animals start behaving strangely. It must just be something local, right? Wrong. It appears that similar situations are occurring all over the world. What could all this mean? 'Signs' is one of those films that tells its audience way too much way too fast. The suspense that is built up early on is eliminated too quickly as Shyamalan cannot keep the rabbit in the hat long enough this time. The same problems that plagued 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' are still prevalent, but a little more pronounced in this one. Overall the film is still pretty good, mainly due to Gibson's screen persona and Phoenix's comic relief.

The three are in for a rude awakening from their simple lives in a small steel town in Pennsylvania. The terrors of Vietnam will change all. DeNiro, an avid deer hunter, cannot stand to even shoot a gun after he returns. Savage loses his legs and is too ashamed and scared to return home to his new wife and friends. Walken has lost it mentally and stays in Vietnam and develops the taste for Russian roulette. The movie is a trial to sit through in many ways, but it is also an important film that was the first commentary on the topic of Vietnam. Meryl Streep also received her first of a record 12 Oscar nominations as Walken's love interest. John Cazale was deathly ill during the making of the movie and died shortly after the film was completed of terminal cancer. Michael Cimino's amazing Oscar-nominated screenplay and out-of-this-world Oscar-winning direction are right on key.

Speed," A Great Action Film That Is Actually a Great Film
","'Speed' was a runaway success in 1994.  It was a block-buster in every sense of the word and critically speaking, it is an excellent motion picture.  The film deals with an LAPD swat officer (Keanu Reeves) who is playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with crazed ex-cop Dennis Hopper.  After Reeves stops Hopper from blowing up a high-rise building, the next obstacle is a city bus.  Hopper has rigged the bus to explode if the 'speed' ever drops below 50 miles per hour.  Sandra Bullock, in her star-making role, plays an unlucky passenger who becomes the center of attention when she is forced to be the driver when the original navigator is accidently shot.  The great thing about 'Speed' is the fact that it never tries to be more than it is. It goes for non-stop action, thrills, chills, and spills.  However, Dennis Hopper's character is somewhat complex and his performance probably should have garnered him an Oscar nomination.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," With the Three-Peat the Circle Remains Unbroken.
","The long-awaited finale to the biggest movie franchise of the last two decades culminates in yet another excellent installment that more than delivers on its unending critical and commercial hype. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' starts off right where the second film of the trilogy ('The Two Towers') finished. Two brave hobbits (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are nearing their final destination to destroy the most powerful ring of Middle Earth with the help of a crazed creature (played by Andy Serkis in a computer-generation mode) who continues to be the poster child for cinematic mood swings and psychiatric shortcomings. The ring has of course run Serkis mad and it remains unclear if the deranged beast will help or hinder in the end. Meanwhile the final battles for the vast landscape that is the franchise forms with Viggo Mortensen finally taking his rightful place as the king in spite of the fact that steward ruler John Noble has pretty much lost all sense of realism and sanity. He is distraught over the loss of his son (Sean Bean from the first film) and treats his other son (David Wenham) as a second-rate citizen. Of course Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies remain near Mortensen's side as the clock ticks to a possible armageddon. Meanwhile hobbits Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have also reunited with Mortensen and the other aforementioned players, but once again it appears that their hearts may get in the way of their somewhat limited brain-power. As all this goes on Miranda Otto and uncle Bernard Hill also ready to help their allies in the war. The love story between Mortensen and Liv Tyler gets some key air-time as she chooses to give up her immortality for a chance to be with Mortensen. Tyler gets into a dilemma waiting for Mortensen just as father Hugo Weaving had foreseen. By the close of the film (and ultimately the series) the various story-lines all finally come together and we get to see what happens to each of these near legendary characters. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' fits in really well with the first two installments, but the only complaint I had (and this is a relatively small shortcoming) was the somewhat difficult ending. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson just did not really seem to know how to end the movie so he used up lots of time (approximately 20 minutes) to carefully give homage and consideration to all his key players. All this neared an interminable state as the production runs a mind-blowing 200 minutes when 175 would have likely been more sufficient. Who can blame Jackson for a little indulgence with J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark novels though? A wonderful three-ring balancing act makes the whole series well worth the time, money and effort for all involved. Still not as good a trilogy as 'The Godfather' group of films, but really 'The Lord of the Rings' was everything it was supposed to be and so much more. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,2,17 December 2003

'Munich' is an unyielding political thriller that becomes more psychological as it advances. Bana and his partners have bouts of conscience, total fits of despair and constant motivational dilemmas. Shady characters galore (Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Amalric) and Bana's female connections back home (wife Ayelet Zorer and mother Gila Almagor) add to the film's depth and wide-reaching personal network. Geoffrey Rush nearly steals the show in limited screen time as the Israeli liaison and seductress Marie-Josee Croze tantalizes and torments. Steven Spielberg does his best work since 'Saving Private Ryan' and does arguably his most complex work since 'Schindler's List'. While not his best film by a mile, it is still probably his most interesting and intriguing.

None of the characters are developed very well, but most do not live to see the end of the film so it really does not matter.  A great horror film that still delivers today.

Casino," Overlooked, But Equally Impressive Scorsese Masterpiece
","'Casino' is a dominant film which is based on the true story of how Las Vegas was transformed from a simple gambling mecca into a place that has as much personality and color as Disney World.  Robert De Niro stars as a casino owner who is on the ground-level of the city's change.  He is a high-class crook who's able to turn profits with the help of the mafia and crooked gaming practices (a norm for all casinos).  Joe Pesci is on hand as the mob assassin with the short fuse who is De Niro's right-hand man. However, no one stays on top forever and De Niro's demise is partly due to his ex-prostitute wife (Sharon Stone, in her Oscar-nominated role).  Bad decision-making, shady dealings, and questionable alliances will also be key factors in his ultimate downfall.  Once again Martin Scorsese has created a film that is so multi-layered and smart that the viewer is completely engrossed for the entire 182 minutes.  'Casino' is a crime epic, in close contrast with 'The Godfather' series of films.  Scorsese accomplishes what he did with 'Raging Bull' and 'GoodFellas'.  Once again De Niro and Pesci shine with Scorsese's direction and the unrelenting screenplay.  Sharon Stone does the best work of her career.  She does not necessarily shine brighter than De Niro and Pesci, but she holds her own and never lets either of them steal her thunder and lightning.  Another great thing about 'Casino' is the supporting cast.  Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, James Woods, and Joe Bob Briggs (!?) all add great elements of both comedy and drama to this outstanding winner which has been overlooked on Scorsese's list of credits, but is just as potent as his other five-star films.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,4,30 September 2000
Heat," Where There Is Heat There Is Always Fire.
","I started writing movie reviews for this site nearly four years ago. During that time I have written information about over 1,200 movies. Constantly I get messages, good and bad, about my reviews. Sometimes individuals point out errors I have made in terms of something I mis-wrote and I go back and correct those mistakes. Others demand changes to be made in my criticisms and those requests always fall on deaf ears. I wrote a review for 'Heat' back in the summer of 2000 and gave it 4 stars out of 5. I liked the movie, but looking back my review was not entirely correct. Surprisingly not one person has ever written to me about my review of this picture (no praise and no criticism). What I want to write today is something that has been bothering me for quite some time when it comes to this movie. I did not reward 'Heat' with as much praise, respect and fondness that I should have. Honestly I think I was not the movie-reviewer I was in 2000 that I am now. I feel I have grown up to an extent and that I must correct the mistake I made in regard to this picture. 'Heat' is one of the most brilliant, captivating, sophisticated, intelligent, honest, emotional and powerfully-moving experiences I have ever had when it comes to the cinema. In modern day Los Angeles a career criminal (Robert DeNiro) and his gang (which includes Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Danny Trejo) go around the city and create destruction and chaos early on by robbing an armored car. Immediately police detective Al Pacino and fellow cops Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi and Ted Levine (among others) get involved in the case. Quickly it is very clear that the thieves are skilled, skilled beyond anything Pacino has ever seen before. Soon a bank heist of more than $10 million is hatched by DeNiro and his gang with help from others like Tom Noonan, William Fichtner and Jon Voight. DeNiro and company though are struggling outside of their work. Kilmer's gambling problem over-shadows his illegal work and wife Ashley Judd turns away from a marriage that is being ruined because of his terrible addiction. DeNiro meanwhile suffers from loneliness and isolation. He has been dealt a poor hand in life, but amazingly he finds love with librarian Amy Brenneman ('Judging Amy' fame). On the good side of the law Pacino is on his third marriage. This time he is with pot-smoking wife Diane Venora. Pacino's obsession with his work has created an island between himself and his wife and his private life is a jumbled mess because of it. Adolescent step-daughter Natalie Portman suffers herself from an unstable home-life (her real father is nowhere to be found) and begins to question why nothing is going the way she would like. A very fine invisible line is drawn to show the similarities and contrasts in the lives of Pacino and DeNiro. Their personal lives are wrecks for the most part, but when they are doing what they were born to do (policing for Pacino and thieving for DeNiro) they are much like mythical gods. Many characters come and go throughout the course of the picture and a few side-stories take place, but in the end 'Heat' is about one of the best relationships I have ever seen in a motion picture. It is a brotherhood-styled relationship between Pacino and DeNiro that is mysterious, complex, legendary and definitely thought-provoking. The picture runs right at 180 minutes and the two all-world performers share only about seven or eight minutes of screen-time, but their time together are some of the very best moments I have ever been lucky enough to experience in motion pictures. About half-way through the film the two meet for coffee in a busy cafe. To a stranger in the restaurant they could be friends or even brothers. What no one except the audience knows is that the two are mortal enemies because of their God-given skills. They do not yell, they do not fight, they do not ever raise their voices. Instead they chat and they get to know each other, they realize that the other is suffering outside of his work and they both learn to humanize one another. They share backgrounds (which they both basically know about each other anyway) and then they share dreams and fears. It is very clear that the duo hate their lives and make up for that empty feeling they both have by immersing themselves in their work. You hope they will actually come away friends from this conversation, but sometimes that just cannot be. Men like these two cannot change. They both act like they cannot stand the heat in their lives but in actuality they must have it in order to survive and function. Pacino and DeNiro admit that under different circumstances they likely could have been friends, but in their topsy-turvy existences that just cannot be. Maybe they won't ever see each other again, but then again maybe they will. Whether they see one another again is not really the point. The point is who you are and what you do ultimately dictates your life. These two are knights in a chess match of words, strategy, territory and ultimately emotional connections. Pacino is a great cop because he can think like a criminal and DeNiro is a great criminal because he has the intelligence to see things like a cop would see them. 'Heat' is all about the roll of the dice in each person's life. Under many circumstances Pacino and DeNiro would be brothers, men who would stand beside one another and fight for the other until the bitter end. However the roll of dice here has come up snake eyes. Both have hardships and both have emotional scars that are literally tearing them up inside, but they do not let that get them down to the point where they cannot do their jobs. Instead they do what they were meant to do and do those jobs to the very best of their ability. The only question is how will these two experts do when they possibly meet again and which will make the potentially fatal mistake that will change the entire landscape of the film. 'Heat' is a film that I really did not get as well as I should have when I first saw it, but as time passes I see the unquestioned brilliance this picture possesses. Really the whole movie becomes a microcosm when Dennis Haysbert (of '24' fame) comes into the picture for the first time. Many have wondered what the point of his character is. The point of Haysbert's character is that you are what you are and you cannot always change that. He has been recently released from prison, but assigned a terrible job as a cook at a small restaurant with a sadistic and cold boss (the uncredited Bud Cort). He wants to do right and make it in life honestly, but it is clear that just cannot be the way it is. An opportunity to work with DeNiro leads to a situation that may be predictable, but is also chillingly dramatic and highly nerve-racking. Writer/director Michael Mann had supposedly been working on 'Heat' as a television movie back in the late-1980s. His work on the very impressive television show giant 'Miami Vice' had endeared him to many in Hollywood. However 'Heat' was stuck in limbo because honestly no one really knew what to make of Mann's vision. The big screen is the only place this would have worked well. In my earlier review I stated that 'Heat' could have been the film of the decade. Looking back I am not sure that this was not the finest picture of the 1990s. Everything is perfect here. Dante Spinotti's cinematography gives Los Angeles a glossy and slick look throughout. The City of Angels has never looked better on celluloid. The very memorable musical score (primarily by Elliot Goldenthal) continues to be quite possibly the finest soundtrack I have ever encountered (Moby's instrumental 'God Moving Over the Face of the Waters' is one of those tunes that has just glued itself to my soul). I believe 'Heat' is a movie that should be studied, embraced, cherished and remembered by all those who realize that movies can create thoughts and emotions within us that nothing else on Earth can. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,4,29 November 2003

The film deals with a young man (Mark Hamill) who must rescue a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) from the evil clutches of Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones).

Gerard Butler leads the titled group and David Wenham serves as one of his top soldiers in the charnel house vomitorium of violence and basic exploitation tactics that wore thin way back in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Apollo 13," Outstanding Film on the Near Fatal Apollo 13 Mission
","Ron Howard's 'Apollo 13' is an innovative and interesting film that is dramatic in spite of the fact we already know what's going to happen. Somehow the suspense is kept up throughout and we can feel the tenseness and the fear of those in space and on the ground.  Tom Hanks gives his usual outstanding performance and he adds to the performances of Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton.  Ed Harris (in an Oscar-nominated role) is the best though, his take-charge attitude and lack of control on the ground may be the most important part of making the movie work.  Kathleen Quinlan also got an Oscar nod, but her role pales to that of the men at NASA.  Ron Howard's direction is outstanding, some of the film was actually shot in zero gravity and the technical effects are terrific.  The film is slightly flawed in a few areas, but 'Apollo 13' is still a film well worth your time.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,3,7,25 June 2000
The Thin Red Line," With Much Competition; The Best Film of 1998
","1998 was easily one of the greatest years ever for movies and 'The Thin Red Line' was the best film of that year.  Terrence Malick came out of a 20-year directorial hibernation to write and direct one of the best films I have ever seen.  The story follows the C for Charlie Company through their nightmarish experience at Guadalcanal in 1942.  They are sent to the South Pacific island to overtake an area that is going to be used as an airspace for the Japanese army.  From the strange landing on the island, where there seems to be no Japanese army on the land at all, to the final frames, 'The Thin Red Line' is crafted perfectly by the eclectic Malick.  Every 30-second frame of this film could be dissected and analyzed by the finest of film students and even then one would not likely be able to get to the heart of this film.  It's that well-crafted and complicated.  Every noise, camera shot, and reaction from an actor has a meaning in this film.  This film is not for those easily distracted, the squeamish, or those with short attention spans.  All 2 hours and 50 minutes of this film are imperative, missing even the smallest of scenes could destroy the whole point of the picture.  Many critics and most of the mainstream audience misinterpreted this film in some way.  If one is not careful it is easy to do that.  The fact that 'Saving Private Ryan' came out during the same year stole much of this film's thunder when it became available to both the critics and the audience.  Is this film better than 'Saving Private Ryan'?  In my opinion it is by the smallest of margins.  True they are both great films but 'The Thin Red Line' is a film that, if you really sit down and absorb it, will stick with you for a very long time.  It's one of those films that you can see 12 times and you will still see something new the 13th time you see it.  It did not win any of the seven Oscars it was nominated for (even though it probably deserved to for Malick's Adapted Screenplay at the very least), but I think the effect of 'The Thin Red Line' will make it the most memorable film of 1998 when we look back at it 20 years from now.",Null,3,6,24 June 2000
Fantastic Four," The Gruesome Foursome.
","Five scientists in outer space are exposed to a mysterious form of cosmic radiation which alters their DNA makeups in various ways. One (Julian McMahon) becomes a madman and the others (Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis) become the titled superheroes who fight for truth, justice......and you know the rest. Disappointing entry for the genre that has a sorry story, old special effects and uneven characters. Alba and Gruffudd's past romance becomes tiring fast, Evans is a woman-crazed nut who takes his powers as a grain of salt and Chiklis is a depression-inducing character whose background and dilemma seem totally out of place in this picture. McMahon's power-crazed mega-billionaire provides flashes of interest, but the production's tone when dealing with him is so dark and disturbing that he too seems like he is in the wrong movie. DC Comics' 1960s invention was old and tired even back then because superheroes were nothing new. Hanna & Barbera's animated take on the comics were never anything noteworthy either and thus it becomes a bit of a mystery why anyone ever believed the premise would translate to the silver screen.

","An architect (Adam Sandler) with pressures aplenty from work and a general lack of time unwittingly solves his problem by getting a remote control that can literally control his universe. The remote is given by a mysterious man (Christopher Walken ala Christopher Lloyd in the 'Back to the Future' series) and it comes equipped with all the features, but these features go way beyond just manipulating the boob tube. Immediately the device becomes a prevalent part of Sandler's life as he is able to fast forward through mundane parts of his life and also make potential difficult feats go by in a matter of seconds. But what happens when the great power gets abused and the device takes on a life of its own, making decisions to fast forward by itself as Sandler just becomes an unfortunate spectator in his own life? Amazingly impressive feature that markets itself as a typical summer comedy, but is that and so much more. More dramatic than comical, 'Click' is a curious over-achiever that is best-described as 'It's a Wonderful Life' or 'A Christmas Carol' without the holiday season settings. Throughout Sandler is presented with choices and unfortunately he has to prioritize his life and of course the pressures of work (represented primarily by boss David Hasselhoff) sometimes overshadow the time that his family (wife Kate Beckinsale, their children and parents Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner) rightfully deserves. Director Frank Coraci (best known for light weight Sandler vehicles like 'The Waterboy' and 'The Wedding Singer') shows real growth as a filmmaker as he handles the deceptively heartfelt script with style and flair.

Sin City," Cinematic Hell 101.
","Sickening and stressful mess uses that 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' technology to get its shocking points across. Four stories intertwine and twist together in an otherworldly metropolis known as Basin City. An old washed up detective (Bruce Willis) tries to stop a child molester (Nick Stahl) who happens to be the son of a high up government official (Powers Boothe). Stahl has kidnapped a young girl (Makenzie Vega), with Willis and shady partner Michael Madsen hot on his trail. Two-time felon Mickey Rourke wakes up one night and finds his lover (Jaime King) dead. He vows revenge and learns of horrific events just outside the city's landscape as quiet psychopath Elijah Wood and Catholic cardinal Rutger Hauer are going around and indulging in cannibalism with helpless prostitutes as their victims. Rourke, along with lesbian parole officer Carla Gugino and King's twin sister (King again), go on a disturbing journey to stop the deviant duo. But will they become victims themselves in the process? On another side of town a bar-room waitress (Brittany Murphy) is having a love affair with the enigmatic Clive Owen to the dismay of abusive boyfriend Benicio Del Toro. Del Toro is a rough customer who has his own entourage of thugs. Soon the friction between Owen and Del Toro drifts into a dark part of the city where a gang of prostitutes (led by Rosario Dawson, the meek Alexis Bledel and ninja Devon Aoki) rule their territory with violent street justice. Del Toro has a secret though and eventually a war with underground criminals (led by Michael Clarke Duncan) seems imminent for all concerned. As all these stories transpire, a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) pops up again and again. How does the ultra-hot Alba fit in to the complicated puzzle? These three tales are bookended by yet another side-story of a quiet assassin (Josh Hartnett) who always seems to be around beautiful women. 'Sin City' starts off as a nightmare and does not let up until its finale. Based on Frank Miller's graphic novels from a few years back, the series of stories was never really more than glorified comic books for underground groups. Miller, (who co-directed with Hollywood maverick Robert Rodriguez), has a jumble of ideas running through his over-active head. Some look at his concepts as edgy and innovative, but to me they are just sick and silly. Most American junior high students could come up with similar ideas and their ability to translate those ideas to celluloid form would likely be as good as this (not a compliment). A real study in watching hot women, ugly characters, stupid stories, and charnel house violence.

Gangs of New York," There Is a Pain in My Heart That the Passing Years Will Never Heal.
","Easily the best film of 2002 in spite of the Academy's ignorance and the views of some movie-goers that do not always completely understand the importance and relevance of many great movies that transcend the world's greatest medium of communication. 'Gangs of New York' is one of the best and most important productions the cinema has ever produced. It is New York 1846 and a small band of Irish immigrants led by holy man Liam Neeson try to take on the heartless and violent white Anglo-Saxons of the Five Points area led by the dark and deranged Daniel Day-Lewis (in an Oscar-nominated role). Valiant and determined, the Irish give a good fight but cannot overcome a stronger gang that has greater numbers. Fast-forward 16 years and Neeson's son (Leonardo DiCaprio) is back to the scene of his father's untimely death and vows revenge, regardless of the cost. Things have changed a bit though as former supporter John C. Reilly has become a Day-Lewis disciple that hands out unlawful justice as a city cop. Crooked politician Jim Broadbent runs the Tammany Hall Era with the everlasting fear of Day-Lewis and his seemingly innumerable group of thugs. Also Neeson's former friend (Brendan Gleeson) is along for the ride, but his motives are difficult to figure out at first. DiCaprio comes back into contact with childhood friend Henry Thomas (of 'E.T.' fame) and quickly falls for beautiful pick-pocket Cameron Diaz (in her greatest role by a mile). Naturally Diaz has the looks of an angel, but a tarnished soul as she is little more than a thief to other New Yorkers and a glorified lover to Day-Lewis. DiCaprio's plan is to kill Day-Lewis and create a new destiny for the city, but killing the man means that he must gain his confidence and then strike at the most surprising of times. While all this goes on, immigrants come in by the boatloads and are immediately sent to fight in this country's Civil War. Twists and turns occur and in the end the infamous 1863 Draft Riots are the only logical conclusion for the city and all the people within the area's vast landscape. 'Gangs of New York' is strong in every department. The film's amazing costume design, cinematography, landmark art direction and engrossing story puts the production into an area that very few movies ever experience. The catalyst is of course Martin Scorsese (Oscar-nominated in direction) who combined the finest elements of seemingly every other film he has ever worked on and added intense methods from directors like Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock and the greats of the Italian cinema like Federico Fellini. The scope of the film is epic and yet very precise at the same time. All the performances are landmark from top to bottom with there being a few dozen speaking parts. Day-Lewis dominates above everyone as he becomes one of the silver screen's most interesting characters. He is a villain (one of the most frightening ever), but yet there is a depth to him that makes him strangely sympathetic and understandable. The spirits of the DiCaprio character and the Day-Lewis character share an odd bond of hate, but mutual respect and even a father-son type of love. The film's hot soundtrack has an ominous tone and U2's amazing 'The Hands That Built America' (which was also Oscar-nominated) may be the finest song to ever go with a major motion picture (it does for 'Gangs of New York' what 'My Heart Will Go On' did for 'Titanic' in 1997). I want to make it clear that 'Chicago' is a fine film, but it is not in the cinematic galaxy of 'Gangs of New York'. 'Gangs of New York''s 10 nominations and zero Oscar wins is probably the greatest tragedy throughout the Academy's history. With that said, 'Gangs of New York' will join the likes of films like 'Citizen Kane', 'Giant', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Raging Bull' (also directed by Scorsese), 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Traffic' as being landmark events that were too smart, sleek and sophisticated for the eyes of the Academy. In short films like 'Gangs of New York' make the Oscars become exactly what they are: trivial and unnecessary. The evolution of New York and the appearance of the Twin Towers at the end is a fitting, poignant and emotional tribute to a great city and an appropriate finale to an outstanding film. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,1,3,25 March 2003
Windtalkers," Could Have Been So Much More.
","'Windtalkers' is one of those war films that loses its focus far too easily and this impedes the greatness it should have displayed. The titled characters (Adam Beach and Roger Willie) are two Navajo Indians from the Southwest who are trained to dispatch and receive messages in their native language to communicate to soldiers in the U.S. military during World War II and keep the Japanese from knowing what is being transmitted. Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater are the two Marines assigned to protect the two code breakers. The film goes way too much for actual war and battle sequences and this makes the movie just another combat picture that fails to tell the story that it should have told. Cage is given way too much air time. He is of course the star, but the movie focuses way too much on his past experiences in combat. The Indians lack the material needed to really make a lasting impression. Christian Slater is solid as he gives perhaps his greatest performance to date, but once again he is not given near enough screen-time or background. John Woo's expertise in the action genre makes the film feel very realistic, but this is a war film that should have been more like 'The Thin Red Line' instead of 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Black Hawk Down'.

Braveheart," An Amazing Accomplishment, Easily the Best of 1995
","I can remember when everyone was shocked when 'Braveheart' won the Best Picture Oscar of 1995.  However, 'Braveheart' was easily the best film in an above-average year for movies.  Mel Gibson's style of directing is the heart in 'Braveheart'.  It is a cinematic event.  In 2 hours and 59 minutes Gibson tells the story of William Wallace, a Scottish rebel in the late 13th Century, who led a rebellion against the English and freed a nation from an evil tyranny.  We get a glimpse of Wallace as a young boy to his awful death at the hands of the English.  The greatest argument about this film is whether this film is history or Hollywood.  Well it's more Hollywood than history, but that has nothing to do with the greatness of the film.  Gibson reminded us of all the great epics of the late-1950s and early-1960s with this masterpiece.

This is the set-up for a journey that does not only affect the primary character, but ultimately all others around him as it soon becomes clear (too blatantly) that 'Happy Feet' has a lot deeper message than other computer-generated animated features of the type. Uneven and manipulative production is second-to-none in terms of the elements of story-telling and technical film-making, but it tries to do too much with what it has going for it and ultimately nearly falls through very thin ice.

Immediately, the flashbacks begin and we see the character throughout his rough and turbulent life in the slums of one of the largest and most unforgiving cities in the world. Comedy, tragedy, crime, and intense drama blend together to prove Patel has the street smarts necessary to actually go the distance. Older brother Madhur Mittal, who has become a cutthroat thug, and one true love Freida Pinto (who just illuminates an already visually bright production), prove to be the most endearing people in Patel's life. Scene-stealer Anil Kapoor (as India's answer to Regis Philbin) nearly steals the production as the demented and acid-mouthed game show host who is tough to completely figure out. The movie also appropriately serves as a tribute to the former city of modern-day Bombay. Brilliant direction by Danny Boyle and an amazingly smart screenplay by Simon Beaufoy highlight a film which dominates in every major aspect of the cinema---from its mind-blowing editing to its revolutionary cinematography and finally to its addictive soundtrack and score.

Of course all are from different backgrounds, and immediately show their distaste for each other.  However, they learn about each other and figure out that they are not that different after all.  Judd Nelson is super, he is the film's greatest asset.  Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Molly Ringwald are all adequate.  Ally Sheedy is definitely the weakest link as she is quiet the first half of the movie and is then really annoying when she actually starts talking.  Paul Gleason is also on hand as the principal, but his part is never really explored as thoroughly as it should have been.

Gladiator," Another Curious Best Picture Winner
","'Gladiator' is a special effects tour de force that tries to combine the major elements of 'Ben-Hur' and 'Braveheart' but fails to generate the interest, intensity, or intelligence of either of those films. Military General Russell Crowe (Oscar-winning) is going to take over the throne of Rome when ruler Richard Harris passes away. Son Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar-nominated) finds out and takes matters into his own hands (literally). Crowe is to be killed, but he escapes and becomes a slave. His family has also been slaughtered in the venture. Crowe is then bought by the wise Oliver Reed and learns that the coliseum is to reopen with gladiator games. Now he is a gladiator and he wins over the country and continues his plans to get revenge on Phoenix. 'Gladiator' is definitely a good-looking film and it is well-made. The costume designs, editing, special effects, and direction are all exceptional. However, the screenplay is nothing special. It has been done dozens of times before in better films. All the performers seem overwhelmed by the production as well. Crowe does admirably, but his part is not very complicated at all. His Oscar win is a bit strange. Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Djimon Hounsou, and the late Oliver Reed are all disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent though with his laid-back, but sometimes over-the-top performance. He is the spark that the film desperately had to have. The incestuous and deviant sexual under-tones do nothing to help out the film and end up being an unnecessary distraction.

'Contact' is smart, well-made, and all the performers are great, but the screenplay is the film's ultimate downfall.

'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' sizzles in its set-up and its plot development early with a vibrant energy and excitement from its highly likable cast (which even includes stand-outs like Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Ken Jeong), but is steadily destroyed by the titled characters. As the clock ticks and the running time becomes astronomical (running nearly 160 minutes) the movie begins to lose its wheels with an unending finale which literally takes up about an hour of the movie's running time. The 'Transformers' series continues to deliver what it promises---sleek cars, sleeker women, and tons of chaotic noise and visuals. In the end though, the complexities of the human performers always seem to take a backseat to the titled weapons of mass destruction. Director Michael Bay seems to overlook and sacrifice legitimate premises and possibly interesting outcomes in favor of confusing and over-wrought visual effects which ultimately do very little to advance the effectiveness which potentially could have developed within. Sometimes less is more and I do not think it could be more prevalent, cinematically speaking, than in this particular movie franchise. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,2,19 July 2011

However, he has a change of heart and becomes an anti-war activist who realizes that one gets nothing out of combat but heartache and sorrow.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is pretty strong, but it is his unrelenting direction that makes the material work throughout.  Tom Cruise established himself as a high-class actor and the film stays above water because of that fact.  The lack of character support does impede the progress of the film though.  Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, and Kyra Sedgwick make somewhat token appearances and the impact of their screen-time is all minimal.  Cruise's character dominates the film.  This is both the film's strong point and weak point.  All in all a strong film, but could have been so much more.  4 out of 5 stars.",Null,33,47,26 July 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Franchise Gets Back to Its Roots and Dominates Again
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is the third film in the series and is very close, in terms of greatness, to the original.  This time Indiana (Harrison Ford) goes after the holy grail, a remnant that the pre-World War II Nazis are trying to obtain.  Sean Connery co-stars as Indiana's father and adds a great wrinkle to the series.  The screenplay is not quite as good as the original's, but the excitement and interest is kept at a fevered-pitch throughout.  Once again Spielberg's direction is the key element that makes the film an overall success.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,9,17,28 July 2000
Back to the Future," Typical 1980s Film That Still Delivers
",'Back to the Future' is a very smart film that benefits from likeable characters and an insightful screenplay.  Michael J. Fox accidently goes back to 1955 in a DeLorean that has been turned into a time machine by the wacky Christopher Lloyd.  Now Fox must bring his parents together after he inadvertently changes the future.  It is not quite as complicated as it sounds.  The film is great fun that seems brand new 15 years later.  A great movie by Robert Zemeckis.  4.5 out of 5 stars.,Null,103,157,5 September 2000
Goodfellas," The Definitive Film of the 1990s
","'GoodFellas' may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like 'The Silence of the Lambs', 'The Crying Game', 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Usual Suspects', 'Fargo', and 'L.A. Confidential' would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's 'GoodFellas'.  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of 'GoodFellas', it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the 'dirty work'.  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,252,426,21 July 2000
The Bourne Supremacy," Don't Hold Anything, Give Me the Supreme.
","Matt Damon and Franka Potente's quiet lives in hiding get smashed quickly when the CIA, assassins and a crazed operation to purchase Russian documents all come together to form a wild maze that threatens them both. Joan Allen (taking over for Chris Cooper), Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and the rest of the standard crew are once again looking for Damon and now he is madder and more determined than ever to rid himself of a past that he still does not completely remember. Equal, if not superior, installment shocks early on and then uses that fresh momentum the rest of the way. Intelligence, non-stop action and deeper characterizations of the key players are the primary calling cards in this high adrenaline winner. Hopefully will lead to further installments in the vastly popular series that has become the first legitimate franchise of the decade. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,8 October 2004
Shark Tale," Under the Sea Take It From Me Under the Sea.
","Excellent animated feature that many have shunned because they feel it paints a stereotypical picture of Italian-Americans and African-Americans. Ignore those people who overlook the vivid animated characters, the highly creative style, the smart story, the strong social messages, the smashing soundtrack and the wonderfully hilarious moments which combine to create a picture that has a little something for audiences of all ages. A two-bit fish (voiced by the always enthralling Will Smith) who works at a place where whales are cleaned constantly dreams of a better life. His life is not all that bad to start with as he has loads of friends and is secretly loved from afar by one of his fish co-workers (voiced by Renee Zellweger). Across the New York-style underwater scene a meek shark (brilliantly voiced by Jack Black) tries to be himself, but does not fit in with his father's (the always rough Robert DeNiro who dominates once again) 'family and associates'. An odd twist will bring Smith and Black's characters together and everything in the exact landscape of the picture will be turned upside down. The voice characterizations (which also includes Martin Scorsese, Angelina Jolie, Peter Falk, Doug E. Doug, Katie Couric and a whole host of others) are right on target as the actors match their animated alter egos perfectly. The creativity of the film is second-to-none. This is a project that swims like a gold medal winner from the starting gun. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,3,8,8 October 2004
The Birds," It Flies to Insanity.
","Wild and riveting film from Hitchcock that has the titled animals turning into villanous monsters that attack all around the small area of Bodega Bay. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor are the two primary characters caught up in the increasingly dangerous situation. Jessica Tandy steals every scene as Taylor's mother here. Hitchcock once again proves that smart direction can save a sub-par screenplay as 'The Birds' is not the smartest film ever made, but it is a movie that does just enough to entertain and make its audience think. Those are sure-signs of a good film. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,9,17,10 July 2002
Jurassic Park," Steven Spielberg Gets Back to His Roots.
","1993 was some kind of year for Steven Spielberg as he finally won Oscar gold for 'Schindler's List', but his 'Jurassic Park' was the monster at the box office. The film is very similar to 'Jaws' in its ability to scare you out of your seat. Man becomes a bit too smart for its own good as a way is found to bring dinosaurs back to life by using DNA from fossilized insects. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough, Jeff Goldblum, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight are among the unlucky humans who become trapped on the island where the theme park is located. A first-hand look at Jurassic Park turns into an amazing journey for survival. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,14 March 2002
Beetlejuice," Juiceless.
","Terribly over-rated film that stars Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as a recently deceased married couple who just cannot get new owners Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones out of their dream house. Thus they decide to contact supernatural nut-job Michael Keaton (in the titled role) to scare the new tenants out of their rightful home. Winona Ryder is almost unrecognizable as Jones' very dark and spooky daughter. Short roles by Sylvia Sydney, Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet do nothing to help out Tim Burton's weak direction and the even weaker screenplay. Not near as funny as it would like to be. Strangely a box office success and still a favorite with many movie-goers, but not with this one. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,3,27 July 2002
The Simpsons Movie," Just D'oh It.
","After nearly 18 complete years running strong on FOX Sunday nights and after a mind-blowing 166 re-writes, 'The Simpsons Movie' finally was born and the result ends up being a fitting correlation with the longest-running animated series in television history. Although far from classic fare and not quite spectacular, the movie does deliver what it promises: our heroes in an often irreverent and hilarious romp with pop-culture subtleties galore to please viewers of most all ages. Homer accidentally pollutes Springfield and the Environmental Protection Agency looks to make an example of the sleepy town by literally doming them in and correcting the problem. Thus the town's first family becomes fugitives and end up in Alaska of all places with smile-cracking outcomes. Saying the movie exceeds three outstanding episodes of the series played back-to-back would be an outright lie, but considering the source and the limited premise, 'The Simpsons Movie' still comes out smelling better than most. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,2,24 November 2007
All the President's Men," Sometimes Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction.
","The Watergate Scandal which was uncovered by Washington Post journalists Woodward and Bernstein (Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman) is the topic of this outstanding picture from the very dominant cinematic year that was 1976. The two will stop at nothing to get to the truth and the strangest thing of all is that this is all based on a true story. An Oscar-winning performance by Jason Robards and top-notch jobs by Jane Alexander (in a strange Oscar-nominated role as she has only about 10 minutes of screen-time), Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ned Beatty and the mysterious Hal Holbrook just add to the film's brilliance. A strong film that, along with 'Network', captured the most Academy Awards (4) in 1976. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,8,15,7 July 2002
The Wizard of Oz," Hollywood's First Great Musical
","The definitive musical in the history of the cinema. 'The Wizard of Oz' is a strong film that never does age and always comes through in its ability to entertain the audience.  Young Dorothy (Judy Garland) is transported to Oz during a tornado in Kansas and that is when the magic begins.  The film goes from black-and-white to color and then the story takes off from there. Dorothy meets some friends (The Scarecrow, The Tin-Man, and The Lion) and they all decide to find the wizard so they can get something that they wish they had (home, brain, heart, courage).  A great film that caters to all audiences.  5 stars out of 5.",Null,2,4,28 October 2000
Dodgeball," Second-Rate Film About a Second-Rate Activity.
","The extended title says it all as a group of underdogs led by Vince Vaughn enter an international dodgeball competition in Las Vegas so they can win $50,000 and keep their old run-down fitness gym open. Of course there is the evil Ben Stiller who wants to eliminate them as competitors and turn their building into extended parking space. And caught in the middle is tax attorney Christine Taylor (Stiller's real-life wife) who gets torn between helping Vaughn and his team and doing her job. Rip Torn is priceless as an old 1930s dodgeball wizard who trains and tutors Vaughn's rag-tag team. Cameos from some of the most annoying people to ever be on film (William Shatner, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff and dull bicycling wonder-man Lance Armstrong) and stupid commentary from annoying announcers Gary Cole and Jason Bateman during the final stages of the production coincide to complete a thoroughly mediocre comedic effort. For once I think that Stiller should have been around more often as he is the only real life blood in this stinker as 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' finally gets decapitated by elements much more lethal than flying rubber spheres (things like bad writing, poor direction, ho-hum acting and waning attempts at cheap laughs are commonplace throughout). Still not terrible for the genre, but ultimately a very unspectacular and normal effort for all concerned. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,26 July 2004
Evil Dead II," Dead in the Woods.
","Plain and stupid low-budget horror fare that is so short on ideas that it basically rehashes its terrible predecessor early on. When the new story actually starts (about 20 minutes in) we get to see four more dumb people that join B-movie ham Bruce Campbell out in that spooky cabin in the middle of nowhere. Co-writer/director Sam Raimi once again showed his early career shortcomings with ho-hum ideas that are more nauseating than interesting. This film goes for black comedy in an unconventional way and this takes what little suspense there was completely out of the series. Considering the success of 'The Evil Dead' (a total waste of film in my opinion), one would think that the slightly bigger budget would have been used on important things like actors and screenwriters, but instead they burned the money on more sickening and visually inferior makeup effects. Trash. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",Null,1,4,28 November 2002
From Here to Eternity," Arguably the Most Over-Rated Film of All Time.
","James Jones' risque trash masterpiece 'From Here to Eternity' quickly got the red carpet treatment by 1953 and was turned into a motion picture that shocked audiences with strong sexual undertones and intense situations during the backdrop of upcoming doom at Pearl Harbor. Officer Burt Lancaster (Oscar-nominated) has the hots for his superior's wife (Oscar-nominee Deborah Kerr). She is upset and bored with her husband and a lightning fast affair based more upon lust than love quickly comes about. New bugle man Montgomery Clift (another Oscar-nominee) has an odd past in the military as he refuses to do prize-fighting for the Army. Thus he pens up his anger and becomes more of a ticking timebomb. He finds short-term happiness with a beautiful prostitute (Donna Reed in her Oscar-winning role), but their relationship is also strained to say the least. The likeable Frank Sinatra (Oscar-winning) locks horns with the crazed Ernest Borgnine and his safety becomes a major concern. While all this goes on, the Japanese attack becomes imminent. Watching 'From Here to Eternity' is a study in caring for rotten characters. It is bad when Sinatra is the most endearing performer by a landslide. This production is not patriotic and in fact it is a down-right sad commentary on U.S. soldiers in Hawaii just prior to the attack. Jones was actually a soldier that experienced Pearl Harbor firsthand and also got a stay in Guadalcanal (using that as his inspiration for the equally crazed novel 'The Thin Red Line'). While Jones' writing skill cannot be questioned, his want to shock was always puzzling to me. 'From Here to Eternity' was definitely trail-blazing with its undertones, but the film is far from excellent and it is a curiosity more than a classic. Director Fred Zinnemann picked up his first of two directing Oscars with this one. 4 stars out of 5.",Null,3,8,2 January 2003
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The Wonder of the Wonder Bread Car.
","The chaotic and silly world of NASCAR is given the spotlight in this hilarious, but under-whelming Will Farrell vehicle which is fast, furious, and totally out of control. Farrell is the titled character, a loud and obnoxious nitwit who just wants to go fast and win every race he can. He has a red hot wife (Leslie Bibb) who only cares about his money, friends galore (former Oscar nominees Michael Clarke Duncan, John C. Reilly, and Amy Adams), a loving mother (Jane Lynch), and a long-lost father (great turn by Gary Cole) who unwittingly had the biggest influence in Farrell's life and career. But evil looms as gay French NASCAR all-star Sacha Baron Cohen (of 'Borat' fame) and lover Andy Richter threaten to destroy not only Farrell's phenomenal career, but ultimately his life as well. To say 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is not funny would be totally untrue, but the laughs die down as the clock ticks and then we are left with a could-have-been movie by the end of the production's running time. A little too long and maybe a little too clever for its own good, I think the picture ran out of gas before it was supposed to. Got to say though, love that cougar Cole gave to Farrell to get him over his driving fears. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,4,8 August 2007
The Godfather," Monumental Film-Making and Arguably the Greatest Movie Ever.
","'The Godfather' is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. 'The Godfather' is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5.",Null,9,16,24 March 2004
