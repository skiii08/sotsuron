The Double Life of Véronique," Beautiful/Complex - An Interesting mixture
","The above statement works not only as an honest description of the film, but also of the character (or characters) portrayed by Irène Jacob. The Double life of Véronique is not a film that allows easy description, it doesn't seem to fit in to any genre or category, it is a film that must be experienced under it's own terms, as a serious, hypnotic work of art. Director Kieslowski sets up the odd dreamlike atmosphere right from the start, using mirror reflections and odd camera distortions to show us the bizarre way that Veronique/Veronika sees the world around her. The use of sepia printing also gives the film an odd distilled look, taking us right out of any 'real' reality, giving each of the frames something special. The problem this creates is that it takes away any real connection we have with the characters, we never really feel anything for them or are even that concerned for their outcomes, Kieslowski moves his actors around his 'stage' in the same way the marionettes are manipulated in the film, but the film works on such a subtly hypnotic level I don't think that Kieslowski ever wanted us to feel part of this world. Kieslowski follows Veronique/Veronika through Paris and Poland, intimately probing her with close, hand-held camera, the cinema-verite effect of this making the viewer feel almost like a voyeur, following the women's every movements and encounters. The Double Life of Veronique is a film that definitely deserves to be seen and requires multiple viewings if we are to get everything out of it's complex, pre-destined narrative. A film full of beautiful images and haunting moods that you'll remember long after, if only there had been a little more focus on the characters I would certainly give it a 10. Maybe my next viewing will lift its marks. 8/10",8,44,55,29 December 2001
Vertigo," Must we all fall before we awake?
","REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS The problem with Vertigo, is that it's neither one thing nor the other, unable to decide what it wants to be.  We open as a detective story, an American detective story, as there is never a trace of noir, but slightly removed from reality, more so than the usual detective story, in a way that everything about the world in which the characters inhabit has an odd sanitised look and feeling, as though there is never any real danger around the corner.  The same thing could easily be applied to Hitchcock's other classic Rear Window, in which besides from the ominous threat of the man across the way, we never had any other worry for L.B. Jeffries.  In Vertigo the lead character is Scottie Ferguson (James Stuart), a detective hired by an old friend to keep a trace on his wife who he believes has been acting irrationally.  Scottie obliges, but pretty soon begins to develop an unhealthy obsession with the woman.  Hitchcock masterfully layers his subtexts and dreamscapes into his dense visuals, but the crux of the story only becomes more misguided.  We are torn somewhere between detective story and avant-garde psychological drama.The plot becomes more complex as we move along, with the kind of twist a-minute scenarios that modern audiences have come to expect, as Scottie is lead deeper into a web of mystery and deceit he has no chance of controlling.  There are many varying interpretations of Vertigo, most of which only thicken the plot more.  There is of course the irrational idea that Scottie dies during the opening leap across the building, or that he is fatally wounded, and the entire film unfolds like a dream, rapidly becoming a nightmare, but this variation only makes the ending of the film seem flawed.  For this to work, the dénouement would need to be less vague, although the idea of the nun brings a nice touch about Scottie confronting his faith, and his run up the steps of the tower becoming an almost allegorical riff on the old stairway to heaven motif, as the wounded Scottie slips from this world into death.  But like I said, it only raises unnecessary complications.  This idea also fails to give insight into Scottie's mental breakdown, if this is a dream, or some kind of life or death situation, then what would be the point of it.Hitchcock's imagery is as much a part of the film as the complex plot, as I mentioned before his composition and iconography layers false dreams and false realities, within the subconscious of the character.  Is it Scotties point of view we are seeing or Madeleine/Judy (Kim Novak)?  We are never sure of anything in the world of Vertigo, so we the audience must create our own false realities behind the film, to lull us into thinking we have a grasp on the proceedings, but we never fully will.  This is were the dream logic comes into play, the idea that we never fully awake from a dream until we fall, much like Judy's character at the end of the film, have we been viewing the proceeding through her eyes?  Who knows, much like a dream, Vertigo is a film that will never be understood, and despite some minor nagging flaws, it's better to just enjoy it whilst it lasts.",8,2,5,23 February 2002
Unbreakable," 'Do you know what the scariest thing is? To Not know you're place in this world' - A comment on THAT ending.
","WARNING Major Spoilers'I think it's time we shuck hands', and with the simple line, the last hundred minutes of Unbreakable become painfully clear. We now know why Shyamalan began his film with the birth of Elijah Price (Jackson), because it is Elijah who has been more important in the plot of the film than David Dunn (Willis) ever was. This film is not about superheros, it's about emotional pain, the confession of Elijah given at the end is heartbreaking, the things he's talking about are things that affect people everyday, but through his acts it's clear that his pain has driven him to insanity. The ending doesn't make you look at the film any differently, but instead, on subsequent viewings we notice how Elijah acts. On first viewing we are too rapped up in Willis' character, and his shock discovery that he might be a little different than he had thought, but on second or third viewings we see more and more the pain that is driving Elijah to set up these events. Elijah has to be sure of David's powers to make sure he is right 'Now I know who you are, I know who I am' he states in his confession, he goes on, drawing parallels through the comic books that took away the pain of his childhood, to his own life 'I'm not a mistake, in a comic do you know how you can tell who the arch villain is going to be, he's the exact opposite of the hero'. Elijah goes to great lengths to point out to David how the 'sacrifices' and the 'tragedies' where not in vein, because now he has purpose, incapable of understanding just how far his mind has gone, as the revelation goes on, more and more of the pain Elijah has gone though is revealed. 'I should have know way back when, because of the Kids, they called me Mr Glass'... And with that we know that Shyamalan has succeeded with this film (unlike the Sixth Sense) is completely pulling the wool over the audiences eyes. If the film ended right at this point Unbreakable would be a 10/10 for sure, but no. End of SpoilersNow we come to the proper comment on the film, no in-depth analysis here, just an honest comment, for you see Shyamalan was obviously so hungry for the same success of The Sixth Sense (but didn't want to compromise his artistic integrity) that he cops out with the last few seconds. Instead of leaving the film on a cliff-hanger, allowing the audiences to use their imagination, Shyamalan has to end his film with two tacked on title cards that explain the events that will happen after the film has faded to black, this was a foolish and lazy move on the part of the writer/director, and for me spoiled the ambiguity that the film had been building right until the shock revelation left me begging for more. Unbreakable is a great film and deserves to be studied and pondered over, if it had ended twenty seconds earlier, we could have been dealing with one of the most underrated modern classics of the last ten years. 9/10",9,0,0,26 December 2001
Akira," Animated fantasy that offers philosophy, politics and ultra-violence
","Although I went through a short faze of watching a lot of anime movies in my early teens, very few of them actually have had a lasting effect on me, with the exception of Akira.  Akira is a twisted cyber-punk thriller that in terms of visuals defies belief, but in plot defies proper explanation.  It's the kind of film in which everyone has a different opinion about the story and of the relationship between Tetsuo and Kanneda and the role that the government play in Tetsuo's downfall.  Most people are put off by animation, believing it will either be all out Disney sentimentality, of sex and gore packed Manga, people refuse to understand that animation can be used to tell stories for an adult sensibility.  Akira has so much story and so many sub-plots all clambering for attention that multiple viewing are required, and it's definitely worth it just to get the most out of the rich characters and consideration to detail that the animators put into every frame.   
There is a strong emotional pull to the characters in this film, a much deeper side to them, deeper than you would find in traditional live action films, in which the characters not only demonstrate the language and fashion of the world they live in, but also help transmit much needed information as part of exposition within dialog.  It's important to look carefully at what the characters say, and to make a mental note of it, as it all comes back at the end of the film.  The focus of the film, as I pointed out above, id the friendship between Tetsuo and Kanneda, both are the complete opposite side of a connected personality that come into direct conflict at the climax of the film, and each one has qualities that the audience can identify with. For example, Tetsuo being the doormat to Kanneda's fearless leader, knowing that he will never escape from his shadow.  We also have the three mysterious children who try to point Tetsuo in the right direction, their faces withered and old.  These are characters whose function is clear, but whose past I still don't fully understand.    In the final act the film kicks into another gear, bringing into play ideas of morality and loyalty, and the more political aspects of dehumanisation and military control.  It also depicts the kind of body-horror mutation that would make David Cronenberg proud, as Tetsuo's body begins to mutate into something more resembling his state of mind.  Again throughout the story we are gripped and the way in which the animation is used, I just can praise highly enough.  Ultimately the film says more than we can answer, leaving the audience (well me anyway) scratching our collective heads.  But that's not really a problem, and it wasn't the last time I've been left cold by a film I enjoyed.  Don't be put off by the fact that this is anime, the deep story and characters make Akira a rewarding experience, and a definite landmark in science fiction cinema.  10/10",10,1,3,24 February 2002
Taxi Driver," `How long have I been driftin' alone through the night' - the defining scene of this film
","One scene above any other defines what Taxi Driver (1976) is all about, many of the scenes of the film have been talked about and mulled over in order to understand just why the film is as important and powerful today as it was when it first hit the screens back in the mid seventies, but no other scene taps directly into the pain and emotion the character is going through. The scene in question in the scene in which deranged cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) sits in his filthy apartment, shirt undone, magnum in hand, captivated by an episode of 'American Bandstand', the barrel of his gun aimed at the young, predominantly black dancers. The obsession and the pain on his face, not out of blind racism as others have commented, but out of jealousy, the fact that the young couples are together and happy. Travis watches the scene alone, his attempt at a relationship with Betsy (Cybill Shepard) pretty much none existent, his loneliness becoming uncontrollable. This scene takes place (if I remember correctly) shortly after the scene in which Travis shoots the robber at the convenience store, his anger and mixed up sense of redemption are seemed to be momentarily healed by the violence, the sense of purpose the almost vigilante assault instated upon him. This is a turning point in the character's life, the calm before the storm if you will, and the music makes this message all the more clear. The words of Jackson Browne in his song 'Late for the Sky' ('How long have I been drifting alone through the night'), of course Travis is going through as stage of self reflection, the song continues - 'Awake again I can't pretend/And I no I'm alone/And close to the end'... Travis is at his end, he can't take any more of the insomnia and the self-hatred that will all be released in the cathartic blood bath at the final, this is the scene in which Travis finally makes up his mind to go ahead with the 'bad ideas' that are rolling around in his head. This is the reason Taxi Driver looses none of it's power after nearly thirty years, the character of Bickle has something everyone can identify with, who hasn't felt more alone in the biggest city imaginable, Travis isn't mad, he's just been pushed too far by his feelings, his want to be 'someone' more than the average Joe on the street. Plus the structure of the film works fantastically with Paul Schrader's writing, the continuity changes in Travis' hair style means we have no idea just how long a time period the film takes up, Scorsese's use of repetitious imagery as Travis cruises the streets in the yellow cab, bring home the mundane-ness of the job, his street level photography and composition, as both writer and director trick us into following this at first eccentric and charming character, into one of the most furious blood stained finals ever committed to film. Taxi Driver is till the best representation of loneliness and urban alienation we have ever seen, and in these less than cynical times, may ever see again. 10/10",10,0,0,6 December 2001
Barry Lyndon," As with all Kubrick movies we're dealing with a cold, detached story of a man searching for his own identity.
","Very much a film of two halves, the first chronicling the rise of Redmond Barry, and the second dealing with the fall of the now appointed Barry Lyndon.  This is a similar structure device applied by Kubrick, notably in A Clockwork Orange and later in Full Metal Jacket, both of which depicted the long development process of an individual at odds with his society and surroundings.  The parallels between Barry, Alex and Private Joker are staggering, from the cynicism and underhanded intelligence, they each, somehow manipulated their way from common rogue, to a character with reasonable standing within the structural society of the film. 
The second Act is by far the strongest part of the film, because it is by this stage that we begin to feel empathy for Barry, but it is also the part of the film, which differs greatly from those other Kubrick masterpieces. For example, A Clockwork Orange showed our hero return to his murderous ways, cured by the state that originally imprisoned him for his crimes, whereas Full Metal Jacket showed the platoon soldier on, in both instances we got the impression that the film may be over for us but the characters had a long way to go.  This isn't the case with Barry Lyndon.  Although it may be argued that Barry's 'luck of the Irish' lifestyle may still have some excitement left in it, there is the feeling that we have all ready been privy to the best part, that no matter what happens next for him will not reach the same unbelievable fortune and misfortune that has followed him through the course of the film. Kubrick plays with notions of loyalty, love, power, deceit, war, honesty and nobility with Barry Lyndon, never allowing the film to flag or become tiresome.  As much a film of technicality as it is performance (as with all Kubrick), it was to be the film that would set the visual staple for subsequent period films The Dualists, Dangerous Liaisons and Amadeus. Kubrick's approach to filming in Barry Lyndon is like filming renaissance paintings, employing the long zoom in's/zoom out's to show us the necessary information, never merely cutting away to an object.  This is so rare nowadays, with cuts in films getting quicker and quicker, Kubrick manages to condense everything of importance of those times (fashion, architecture, music) and fill every corner of the frame, and the recurring theme of Handel's Sarabande is hauntingly evocative. The performances are strong, given Kubrick's standing as a visual film-maker, with Ryan O' Neil giving a fine performance, along with Leonard Rossiter, Patrick Magee, Marisa Berenson, and Leon Vitali ensures that acting is of the same calibre as the cinematography, and O' Neil giving the standout of his career (even with the accent).  An overwhelmingly beautiful film that should rank amongst Kubrick's greatest, which has somewhere along the lines been sadly forgotten.  With a deep emotion and wonderful moments, Kubrick's film version of Barry Lyndon has that rare power to restore the love of film-making to any jaded film fan.  10/10",10,1,2,2 March 2002
Grease," Almost overcomes the nagging flaw in the climax
","Highly energetic and enjoyable adaptation of the hit stage musical sees 'summer lovers' Danny (Travolta) and Sandy (Newton-John) re-united for the last year of high school. Complications in love follow, but none of that is really important as the film zips along from one catchy show-stopping tune to the next. Randal Kleiser's spirited direction and wide-screen photography make sure that both story and musicals are carried off with the traditional level of flare, but never succumbing to style over substance, although the plot is wafer thin, we do really care about the varied cast of characters.
One thing that struck me whilst watching Grease again (As an adult) is just how filthy the film really is (but in a good way) I can't believe that my parents used to let me watch this when I was four years old. Truthfully at the time having Travolta refer to a car as a 'Pussy-Wagon' went way over my head, but at least the climatic race kept me enthralled. Now I see the films subtle humour, crass sexual innuendo and topical issues (Teenage pregnancy is covered) and it only helps to give the film a little more.The cast should be applauded, not only for their excellent singing and dancing, but also for making their character believable, we hardly ever ask the question as to, why there are so many high-school students in their early thirties, in some films this could be a problem, but Grease manages to grab you from the first animated frame of the opening credits and never let go right up to the final lively staging of 'We Go Together'.
If the film is flawed, then it comes naggingly at the end, with the final shots descending into pure fantasy, destroying any 'realism' (this is a musical, I use the term lightly) the film had expertly created, it comes off as a phoney, sell-out gesture on the part of the film-makers, and in all honesty I hate it. Still, the film does just about over-come that nagging flaw, and the long list of (then) celebrity cameos and classic songs (Look at me (I'm Sandra Dee), Beauty School Drop-out and Grease Lightning are just some of the highlights) make Grease and endlessly watchabale, piece of feel-good fodder. Even if the ultimate message of conformity is a bit messed up. 9/10",Null,1,2,17 January 2002
Gone with the Wind," O' Lordy, I do declare
","Ok, so that is not a direct quote from Gone with the Wind, I allowed myself a little creative free reign.  Now, first things first, I'm not the kind of person who believes that, just because some one says a film is a classic, necessarily mean that it is a classic.  I don't know, maybe to everyone else in the world, Gone with the Wind is the greatest motion picture ever made, it may just be something someone my age doesn't understand, or as Prince put it, a Sign O' the times.  To me, Gone with the Wind looked like nothing more than a four-hour version of Dallas, spliced with Day of our Lives, directed by Ed Wood's older brother (if you could imagine such a thing).  Meaning that the plot was so threadbare and self-important that it really did bring to mind actual scenes from Dallas, and the colours of the film were so bright and sludgy (probably down to the primitive colour printing of the time) that it was hard to make out objects clearly.  The acting was hardly exemplary either, Vivien Leigh tried her best, but the character of Scarlett is one of the most obnoxious, self-obsessed, empty headed character to ever grace the screen, to get an idea of just how bad she is, let's just say she wouldn't be to far out of place in an episode of Beverly Hills 90210.  As for Rhett Butler, well he's a brutish man's man, who has no other characterisation other that the fact that he is Clark Gable and no one else, there is no other shimmer of a character lurking beneath the surface.  There are a couple of key memorable moments in the film, but besides the famous scenes that everyone knows fluently without ever having seen the film, nothing much happens, especially towards the end.  There is also a crass racism to the film, notably in the character Mammy, probably the mentality of the times, but it is surprising producer Selznick didn't just cast a white actor and black the up with boot polish.  Now I am not the kind of person who attacks classic (or so-called classic) films just to get attention, I really do enjoy most classic films, but Gone with the Wind is just to badly dated to even register as anything above average.",Null,0,1,23 February 2002
Tigerland," Hollywood's debt to Lars von Trier
","Because he's give the American overrated hacks an excuse to call themselves artists, Spielberg and Mike Figgis jumped on the dogme-style bandwagon with Saving Private Ryan (1999) and Leaving Las Vegas (1996) respectably, now it's Batman and Robin 'helmer' Joel Schumacher's turn to wield the hand-held camera. Now when Von Trier shoots in his typical, no glamour style that he made famous to the world with Breaking the Waves (1996) it comes off as a serious artist, trying to express himself in a new way, when Hollywood picks up on something it's purely because they can milk it's popularity and introduce something new to 'Joe Six-Pack' and the family, then THEY look like the artist. Hollywood banality aside, Tigerland is a honourable attempt by Schumacher to shake off the backlash of the bat franchise and even the pompous 8mm, and to be honest he doesn't do that bad a job with it. If the film fails it's down to the script, no matter how much Schumacher tries to inject his film with a documentary realism, the script keeps throwing us more of the same character clichÃ©s and overtly profound dialog that we've seen in a million other war movies over the years, most noticeably Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987). Tigerland resembles the first half of Full Metal Jacket almost identically; we have the typical cast of characters (Likable rough, tough drill-sergeant, trouble maker). But whereas Full Metal Jacket devoted only thirty minutes of it's running time to it's 'Paris Island' set scenes, Tigerland devotes almost as much time on basic training. Still, that said Tigerland isn't too bad a movie, to be completely honest it's pretty good and it shows Schumacher's willingness to grow as a director, and that he isn't afraid to take a risk.

The Elephant Man," 'The stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats... Nothing will die'
","Never could one hope to find a film as ugly and beautiful as David Lynch's film biography of John Merrick (The Elephant Man).  Merrick's story is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking and appalling cases of human injustice to those different, with a strong message, which still holds importance to this day.  In the hands of a lesser talented director this film may have been just another pointless Hollywood story, but in the hands of Lynch the film becomes a haunting, beautiful, but at the same time, highly disturbing work of art.  Always surrealistic in its storytelling approach, the film sets up Merrick's complicated birth with an abstract dream/flash back sequence, dimly lit and photographed in gloriously grainy black and white the audience can't help but be immediately drawn in to the story.The film then jumps forwards, and introduces us to the character of Fredrick Treves (Hopkins) at a London carnival, where Merrick is being shown as part of the sideshow.  Treves is unable to see Merrick due to the police, who close the show before he gets there, but hungry for a glimpse he arranges to for a private showing with Merrick's owner Bytes.  Lynch is reluctant to show us Merrick in full daylight for the first quarter of the film, which in my opinion was a clever move, because it allows we the audience to share Treve's intrigue as to weather or not the tag Elephant Man is suited, or whether we are being duped into seeing something not too much out of the ordinary.  It is only later that, after we see Merrick, we realise that he is truly deformed beyond human recognition.The next part of the film is where the real argument of The Elephant Man rests, the age-old argument of beauty only being skin deep and how those who have beauty on the outside often have none on the inside.  As Merrick goes to show the staff of the hospital of which he's taken residency that he is an articulate, erudite human being, he is slowly integrated into polite society, not from respect though, the crowds are only gathering because viewing Merrick has become something of a status symbol, and this is where Treve's must decide whether or not he has forced John to exchange one freak-show for another.  For me The Elephant Man is one of the most staggering and moving films of recent cinema, the herald of a maverick talent in the then young David Lynch, and brimming with evocative production design, beautiful photography and a wealth of fine performances from Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud and Michael Elphick, not to mention Hurt's remarkable performance hidden under layers of prosthetic make-up.  It is true what others have said, that The Elephant Man is a very bleak, very downbeat film, a film not afraid to hold a mirror to society's injustices, but the ending is uplifting in a different way than most conventional happy endings.  In the respect that John has just has the happiest day of his life, and no day will ever be that good, so the perfect way to end that perfect day, is to sleep like he has always wanted to, even if it will result in his own death.  With the final line (used as my summary), we are told that nothing dies, that the spirit will always live on.  What a touching sentiment to the endurance of the human spirit.  A masterpiece 10/10",10,8,8,20 April 2002
A Clockwork Orange," 'As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures'
","It's got to be handed to Kubrick; no other director can be cited as making so many back-to-back classics in his working career.  His ability to move seamlessly from genre to genre, still covering the themes of man's metamorphosis, his place in the universe and his desire to choose between right and wrong, is something some filmmakers never manage.  If his previous film 2001: A Space Odyssey was his attempt to look at man's place in existence, the surely A Clockwork Orange is a look at man's place in society, not in any Ken Loach, lower class, upper class rivalry way, but in how man functions in society.  The question raised by Kubrick and writer Anthony Burgess is `if man cannot freely choose between right or wrong does he cease to be a man?'  Kubrick and Burgess seem to be in agreement, yes! But whereas Burgess' novel showed us that, given time, the person will soon grow-up and decide for themselves, once and for all, what path to choose in life.  But because Kubrick missed the last chapter of the book, the film takes on an entirely different agenda. The year is now 2002, we have sailed through the year that Kubrick made famous with his watershed sci-fi picture, and we stand looking out at an uncertain future, and one thing that stands out, is the shocking similarities between the fantasy of A Clockwork Orange, and the reality of the everyday world.  Hooligans are everywhere, teenage louts that have elderly people too terrified to leave their homes after dark, our countries are run by lying, back-stabbing politicians who are always out for their own gain, and now scientists are looking into new treatments for the correction and rehabilitation of violent offenders.  It's not hard to see the pompous politicians of A Clockwork Orange and not subliminally think of Jack Straw or Tony Blair stood at the podium.  And this is the talent of Stanley Kubrick, his ability to build lasting images through his own visual sense. Everything about his movies takes on a certain iconography, they not only represent the style of the times they where made and simultaneously dictate the style of when they are set, I mean, who wasn't just a bit let down by the year 2001's less than glorious look in comparison to Kubrick's vision, in the same way we are perturbed by A Clockwork Orange's dilapidated future. Kubrick turns Burgess' themes into a full scale plan of attack, complimenting his message by utilizing all the camera and editing effects that went into the grandeur of 2001, but simplifying them to conform to both the idea of A Clockwork Orange, and the film's limited budget.  The use of slow-motion and ultra-speed works well, even if the laughable high-speed sex orgy looks like a throw back to the days of Benny Hill, and some people have trouble with the use of back projection and process shots, but all of these help build the world of the film, and help dictate the skewed perception of Alex (McDowell).  Both the character of Alex and the way in which McDowell portrays him is unbelievably complex, guiding the audience through this world with his narration, he makes the audience one of his `droogs' which means that we like Alex right from the start, his actions may appal us, but at this stage he's our only ally.  This is another one of Kubrick's trump cards, because if we like Alex, then we will feel for him as his victims take their revenge, and that's when the film has you, when you start to feel sympathy for this amoral character.`What's it going to be then?' is the future of A Clockwork Orange almost upon us, is Kubrick such a master film-maker that his films have the ability to predict time? Well, since none of us are now actually revolving in a space station to the haunting echo of `The Blue Danube' I would say no.  But it is impossible to watch the images of restrained violence and political corruption of A Clockwork Orange and not be drawn in, and more importantly not you leave feeling overwhelmed by the attention to detail and iconic, haunting images that Kubrick shows us.  Pop-art fantasy, or harsh political indictment, you decide.  10/10",10,1,2,7 February 2002
Con Air," 'I'm goner show you God does exist'
","`Oh the Action Movie', as a child of the eighties I was practically raised on a diet of loud explosions, simple scenarios, white vests and killer one liners.  So with so many action films around, why do I turn my attention to the only slightly above average `Con Air'?  Well, for a start, I watched it last night and it's still fresh in my mind, but besides that Con Air represents every aspect of the turning point of the action movie.  So it's one small step for entertainment, one giant leap for Jerry Bruckheimer's bank balance.  The simple scenario of Con Air involves Parolee Cameron Poe (Cage) hitching a ride home to his wife after a seven-year sentence for murder.  Of Course Cage didn't mean to destroy the hillbillies' vocal chords at the start of the film, that wouldn't be very heroic, instead he is protecting the honour of his ladylove.  This being Hollywood, we couldn't let the hero be a real killer, but that doesn't stop the film-makers populating the rest of the film with the most adorable host of paedophiles, rapists, and murderers, some of whom only serve as nothing more than comic relief.You see, this is the big plot mover in Con Air, every action movie has a plot mover, be it the taking of the Building in Die Hard, or Sarah Conner's decision to run in The Terminator, in Con Air, as luck would have it, Cameron Poe is being delivered out of captivity on a prison airplane.  Not just any airplane mind, this one is filled with said jolly bunch of paedophiles, rapists, and murderers and as if we couldn't guess, the maniacs end up taking over the asylum.  What follows may not be Bergman, but it does constitute as some damn fine, time tested entertainment, for as we all know Bruckheimer is of the, `if it ain't broke don't fix it' school of producing, so here we have a (just under) two hour re-hash of Bad Boys, The Rock and Top Gun.  The film follows the path we would expect it to and ends in exactly the way we knew it would, but it doesn't matter how tired and predictable the film may be, because it does what it's supposed to do, and that is to deliver a solid piece of mind-diverting entertainment with all the loud explosions, white vests and killer one liners (`Buckle-up') that any action film fan craves for.Elsewhere, the acting, for this kind of film anyway, is first class, with a definite ensemble at play.  Besides Cage, who continues his role of the action hero that he perfected in The Rock, and later carried through to Face-Off, this time however, delivering all his lines with an hilarious deep southern twang (`Dis iz your Barbeque an it taste gud' is just one side splitter), but adding to his star power we also have the two Johnnies, Cusack and Malkovich as the Good and Bad elements.  Both are good in their respected roles and there is fine support from Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and Colm Meaney.  To top it all off, the director is Simon West (aka Michael Bay without pretension) who applies an unbelievable amount of colour filters and MTV editing, that we have now come to expect from the Hollywood crap factory.  So to finish, Con Air is a decent enough action movie that washes over the brain and leaves you punching the air with excitement, it may not be high art, but it's still a pretty fun ride.  7/10",7,2,3,7 February 2002

","Purists and would be 'cinephiles' have been arguing now for twenty years as to which is the definitive version of Blade Runner... Is it the studio version, with its Phillip Marlow-esque narration and it's tacked on 'Hollywood' ending. Or is it the supposed 'Director's Cut' with narration missing, the unicorn dream sequence and the 'what the hell' ending... Personally, I don't know because personally I've never really 'got' Blade Runner. I'll be the first to point out the ground-breaking visuals and the un-rivalled special effects that still stand-up to this day, but I've never 'got' the film because I just can't buy into the central concept of a cop who, in the words of Rutger Hauer 'Mopes around then f**ks a refrigerator', ok, that may be completely miss-quoted but you get what he was trying to say.Deckard, the character portrayed by Harrison Ford is perhaps the most useless cinematic detective ever seen, not only is he slower than a bus on a motorway (if you've been stuck behind one you'll know what I mean) but he gets beaten-up by almost every one of the Replicants. He never seems to grasp the notion that these 'people' are dangerous and perhaps he should tread carefully, instead he barges in playing it cool and ends up getting his ass kicked at every turn. Now the main reason Blade Runner left me cold (replicant sexual-politics aside of course) is the questions it raises and it's failure to give a proper answer to them. The 'what the hell' ending I mentioned whilst talking about Ridley Scott's infamous director's cut refers to the fact that we only get half the interpretation.Okay, so Deckard dreams of a unicorn, possibly one of the implanted memories that could answer the question as to weather he IS a replicant, this is THE question that gets film-geeks more excited than any other in the annals of movie history. If Deckard is a replicant then why would Tyrell implant the memory of a unicorn, I mean a Unicorn for heavens sake, why not say a family dinner or his first date, something that would make Deckard believe he was human and leave him with no doubt about it. I mean a Unicorn; it couldn't have been more obvious if they'd put it on one of the huge neon billboards that hover above the L.A. skyline, 'Deckard is a Replicant'. But Deckard isn't the only character that fails to win me over.With the exception of Hauer's Batty, none of the replicants register, we don't care about them, and if they are such all-knowing works of technology then how come they're such morons, not a one of them has the sense they where programmed with (then again Tyrell was probably too busy planting memories of unicorns or bike riding monkeys to give them any brains or common sense). The world of Blade Runner is a cold, harsh and un-feeling world, a world of constant rain and darkness where people move about the multi-cultural landscape without uttering a word to anyone else (no wonder Deckard's represses). It's this vision of a crumbling old/new metropolis that makes Blade Runner what it is, but whereas the special effects haven't dated, the use of neon lights and pitch black framing would become the main visual staple for every early nineties music video and TV commercial. This becomes such an annoyance that at times we expect to see a 'Nike' logo supperimposed on the screen.The dialog shoots for profundity, but smacks of pretension, and even if the final battle between Batty and Deckard is very exciting the whole thing just stops, as if the battles behind the scenes had resulted in Ridley getting bored and just going home. I would like to hail Blade Runner as the classic most people make it out to be, but I just don't 'get' it, and as for Deckard, how can you call the character a hero, when the only reason he survives the ordeal is because Batty lets him. Worth a look, but not a classic... 5/10",7,0,1,19 January 2002
Rear Window," Hitchcock challenges the audience to put themselves in the picture.
","The great thing about Rear Window, as others have probably pointed out much better than I can, is the fact that Hitchcock challenges the audience to look at themselves and make the decision of just how far are we, to some extent, the voyeur.  We spend our entire lives watching other people's lives unfold before us on some kind of screen or other, and with the recent explosion in reality based TV shows, the lines between entertainment and exploitation are becoming increasingly blurred.  And Rear Window is one of the few films of this cycle to actual make an interesting point.  Hitchcock uses the environment of the protagonist L.B. Jeffries (his cramped apartment) and never allows us to leave, so we see the entire film evolve from our hero's eyes, helping us identify more.  This is also an important devise, as it means that we the audience are only given privilege to the same information that Jeffries has.  Hitchcock creates an atmosphere and a tension that lasts for ever, right up to the very last minute, never giving the audience an opportunity to breath, we're in the same position that James Stuart's character is in and for a moment, because Hitchcock has so expertly put us in that position we can suspend disbelief and almost feel what he is going through.  If anyone ever has any doubts as to what a talented director Hitchcock was, then immediately point them in the direction of Rear Window. One of the greatest films ever made.  10/10",10,0,2,21 February 2002
