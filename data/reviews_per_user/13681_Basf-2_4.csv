The Blair Witch Project," Hype
","OK, I've finally seen it! My conclusion: the whole Blair Witch thing is one big hype. It's an entertaining, very low budget movie, something like 'The Scariest Home Video's'. In fact, I found the first part a bit boring; it started to get more interesting when they got lost in the woods. That's all! On the other hand: I still like the idea very much that a bunch of kids with a video camera made the most profitable movie ever ( 'El Mariachi' was in fact the same thing a few years ago). It's also very refreshing that they managed to make a very old fashioned 'horror' movie, purely based on suggestion, with no expensive digital special effects at all. Hollywood, eat your heart out! Finally: there's a much better Belgian 'mocumentary' about a serial killer titled ' C'est Arrive Pres De Chez Vous/ Man Bites Dog'. Go check that one out. I'm pretty sure the makers of the Blair witch Project were inspired by it!",Null,0,0,29 October 1999
American Beauty," Great!
","This is simply a great movie! It's that rare proof that big Hollywood studios are really able to make great and interesting movies if they set their mind to it, and for once give up the idea of making another big budget blockbuster with a lot of stars and a lot of explosions, but with a story that's too silly to be true! As far as I know this is the first really interesting movie made by Dreamworks, the studio founded by Hollywood's boy wonder Steven Spielberg and friends. The expectations about this 'independent studio' were very high, but so far never came true. Now they finally do. This is the kind of movie one expects from intelligent film makers. It's all about a 'disfunctional family', and all kind of strange things that happen to them in their suburban surroundings. At times it all seems a little too much, but eventually everything falls into place, and the film is never predictable. The storytelling of the narrative voice over brings back memories of 'Hollywood Boulevard' ( without giving away too much about the plot). It's especially the movie of Kevin Spacey! He's simply fantastic, and on his way to becoming one of my favorite actors ( after for example his roles in 'The Usual Suspects' and 'L.A. Confidential'). The scenes with him are the very best of this film, but the rest of the cast is also of very high quality. The film is beautifully shot, and has the wit of a good Woody Allen movie, and reminded me a bit of last years much praised 'Happiness'.",9,0,0,4 January 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Last Kubrick is OK!
","This is definetely not Kubrick's best movie. But it's really a lot better than some critics might suggest. The story is interesting enough, and Kubrick, as allways, does his own thing: the film is slow, the scenes and shots are sometimes very long, in a time where most movies are fast and flashy! Anyway: it's a lot better than his last movie before this one,  and in my opinion his worst, Full Metal Jacket. The film shows that it's a great loss that there will never be another Kubrick again.",8,0,0,27 September 1999
Tarzan," Not my cup of tea
","This kind of movie is definitely not my cup of tea. Disney has allways been great at creating lovely furry little animals, and of course creatures like Donald Duck and the like. But they have allways been very bad at creating interesting human characters. And there are more and more of those in their recent films, including this one. Also, most animal characters in this film are either too 'human' or very cliche. Finally: it has one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard; !",5,0,4,27 October 1999
