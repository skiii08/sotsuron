Black Swan," The black side
","The black side.Black swan is a movie about a fragile girl whose the mother had put off frustrated dreams of be a famous ballerina. The dream of any ballerina is to dance The Lake of the Swans, by Tchaikovsky, and when Nina is chosen to dance it feeling of realization is immediate. But just as success is very expensive. The movie operates as new reading of 'The Lake of The Swans' and, just as Odete who is stuck in a swan body; the mind of the protagonist is stuck for psychological traumas. The fragile Nina feels the pressure of be the protagonist and the fragile psyche collapses. Nina is perfect for white swan, because she is pure and ingenuous, but she is not for the black swan that is more audacious and malicious. Nina feels more and more pressure and slowly goes crazy. The character is forced for the director (she is in love for him) to have contact with her black side and from this moment she develops a second personality. In search of the perfection Nina and Odete get confused.The mirrors that show up during the movie are reflecting the perturbation of the character; they show the really disturbed psyche of Nina. The director of the ballet knows that there is a black swan inside of Nina and stimulates her black side. Just as the prince to prefer Odile (the black swan) the director and the public prefer the black swan, alter ego of Nina. But Nina's psyche is divided between evil and good, between light and dark. It's then that the already fragile psyche of the character is destroyed and she is led to death.The Nina's dilemma of is common to everybody who seeks success at all costs, she sacrificed herself for the sake of the show and maybe, because of that the character causes empathy the audience.",6,1,1,5 February 2014
