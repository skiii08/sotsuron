Vertigo," Incredibly Creepy Romance
","In my opinion Vertigo is the greatest movie ever and Hitchcock's masterpiece. This is just my opinion, so don't fault me for it. Vertigo is to thrillers what Casablanca is to Romances, what Raging Bull is to sports movies, and what Singing in the Rain is to musicals. Vertigo breaks rules and crosses lines that are not meant to be crossed. The fact that the main character even has Vertigo is a stroke of genius. But the real genius happens at the end, when James Stewart's romantic ordeal is over and he loses his Vertigo. It makes the movie seem like a circle, where in the end Stewart is the same as he was in the beginning. This really caught my attention and made me fall in love with this movie. Vertigo is also one of those movies that cannot be copied. Psycho was copied hundreds of times, as was Rear Window and the Birds, all Hitchcock masterpieces. I know that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but each great director should have one movie that is unimitatable and incredibly unique. Hitchcock pulled this requirement off with Vertigo.",10,7,9,3 July 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Loved This Movie
","This movie is amazing. The only reason I rated it an 8 out of 10 is because of the content. It just is not suitable for some people. But getting beyond that, it is clever, it was unique, and it is still funny. There have been other funny movies that did not hit home the way this one did, however. The reason this one is great is because of the subject. And no, I am not talking about Satan's relationship with Sadam. I am talking about its stance on censorship. I always loved South Park for its social consciousness. Not many shows can do what Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done for 10 or 11 seasons of shows. This movie, however, takes it to the next level( presumably because there was enough extra time to take it to the next level). Just the fact that the mothers got that out of control and wanted to blaim Canada that badly is very typical among parents. They want to blame everyone except for themselves for their kids behavior. Also, I have never seen the harm in a bad word. A word has never killed somebody. If anything, a bad word can be a release for someone who is feeling down or depressed, it is kind of a pick me up. This is another subject South Park addresses. Why are people getting mad at their kids for words, when there are usually bigger problems to deal with? Well, now that my audience has listened to my rant, I will conclude with a suggestion. Watch South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut.",10,0,0,17 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Best Sci-Fi Ever
","This movie is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. This movie is the best of the original three star wars movies, each Sci-Fi masterpieces in their own right. The special effects are the most advanced of the first three. The thing that really got me, though, was Darth Vader. You can really see his struggle. The way he changes subjects whenever Luke mentions there is still good in him is a master stroke of script writing. He is such a dynamic character it is scary. Excluding the main character from Vertigo, I have never seen someone show their emotions in such a realistic way. As I said before, this is without a doubt the best Sci-Fi and the best Star Wars movie there has ever been. Everyone should see this movie at least once in their life (but watch the other two first).",10,0,2,25 July 2008
28 Weeks Later," Best Zombie Movie in a While
","This is, in my opinion, the greatest zombie movie since the original night of the living dead. I actually was scared during this movie. This is saying something because I never get scared during zombie movies. It made me feel like everyone in the theater around me could be a zombie. It was a very acclosterphobic feeling. I would definitely recommend anyone who considers themself a horror buff and liked the Goerge Romero series should definitely watch this movie. It is a great movie of the 'everyone is against you' nature. It is ten times better than some of the other zombie movies to come out (such as Zombie). My final score for this movie would be an 8.7.",7,1,2,23 July 2008
American Beauty," Don't Understand
","I'll will go ahead and say that I think there a lot of films out there (not just films but books as well) that I perceive as being 'faux' deep. American Beauty is just this kind of film. The premise I thought to be a pretty typical premise, the main theme I thought to be a pretty typical main theme, the characters and acting I thought to be pretty typical. In the end though, the thing that turned me away from it was the execution. I just thought everything about this movie was soooo cookie cutter. For example, we took a break in the middle of the movie (I was watching it with friends) and they all started to talk about how cool it was that the main character smoked weed and was an adult. I rolled my eyes because that is the kind of hip bullcrap that directors and writers put in movies to sell to audiences. My final assessment of the movie was that it was Office Space, but without the comedy. Before people think that I am crazy I will explain this theory. So the main character goes through a religious style experience that shows him he should stop living life by other people's rules. It goes well for a while, but then it starts to alienate the man from his wife/girlfriend and drives her away. He ends up really hurting his best friends/neighbors and daughter. Then at the end of the movie the main character realizes that this lifestyle he has been leading really has no substance and that everything that he had before that lifestyle got out of hand is what gave his life substance. Of course, Office Space has a happy ending and American Beauty really doesn't, but the main theme is the exact or close to the exact same thing. Except American Beauty has not comedy...",6,1,3,23 April 2011
Disturbia," Great Movie
","Disturbia is undoubtedly the best thriller to come out since the first Saw movie. It borrows against old thriller classics, such as Rear Window, but where Rear Window gets boring, Disturbia is still chilling. In Rear Window the man has a broken leg, which gets boring after a while. Disturbia provides a fresh twist because the guy in it can still move, but he is under house arrest. This provides excitement. Also Disturbia does not really start being scary until about halfway into the movie. It gives time for character development, which gives the story more content and a more solid plot line. Disturbia is a great movie and I would definitely recommend any movie lover to go see it.",7,1,2,3 July 2008
The Exorcist," Travesty
","I felt proud of myself after I watched the Exorcist. The reason why is because I resisted the overwhelming urge to throw up. I feel anyone that does resist this urge should receive a pat on the back. This horror movie does not deserve a bit of the praise that people give it. It is one of the best grossout films of all time. That was not a compliment. Some people claim that it is better than any other scary movie. This is a joke, Psycho kicks the Exorcist in the butt. No movie has ever made me laugh more than the Exorcist, especially when the girl starts slamming the cross in her unmentionables. I still laugh to this day whenever I think about it. I don't think the point of the movie was to make me laugh.",4,3,9,3 July 2008
Batman Begins," Surprisingly good
","Batman Begins is actually a very good movie. I thought it would be more like the first Batman from the original four, where it just begins with him already Batman and he just has to fight some villain like the joker. This movie, however, delved even deeper in the world of the Dark Knight and took some creative liberties that really ended up paying off. I especially liked how they depicted the Scarecrow. He was not nearly as comic book as he could have been. No, in this movie he was genuinely creepy and seemed like a freak. Batman's relationship with Ras Al Ghul is also played up very well. Its sort of like the relationship between Magneto and Proffesor x, where they both respect each other, they just have differing opinions about how to achieve their own goals.",9,3,4,18 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Horror Action Thriller
","Some people might consider me weird for saying this, but I did not like the Exorcist. It was just too horrific and gruesome. I did, however like Psycho, which I see as the perfect thriller and insight into an insane man. Now Dark Knight is the perfect blending of both of these movies. It had the thrilling and overwhelming power of Psycho with the disturbia of the Exorcist. It might be weird for me to compare an out and out action film like the Dark Knight to two horror movies, but in some ways it was like these. It just did not stop the intensity for one second. Just when you think it is about to slow down, it doesn't, and it gets even more intense then before. The ending was also amazing because it was not happy by a long shot. This movie is just insane on so many levels, and I would not recommend it to the squeamish, and I definitely would not recommend it to pregnant woman or children under the age of 15. For everyone else, I want you to see the action movie that kicks every other Action movie in the butt.",9,1,4,18 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Great Visuals
","2001 is a masterpiece for one reason and one reason only. This is the cinematography. There is nothing innately original about the plot or exceptional about the actors, but the visuals and direction are unmatched. It is Kubrick's Vertigo, at first glance boring, but for a struggling director it could be a great lesson. The only difference is that Vertigo can be compelling to the average movie goer, as long as they are in the mood to be compelled. It would not advise the average movie goer to see this movie. It is Star wars without the action. People also talk about how creepy it is, but I did not find it so creepy. It is going to be a long time before computers get advanced enough to be able to willingly kill a human, so, while a good plot point, it is not realistic and therefore not creepy. In conclusion, I would recommend that everyone sees this movie, not because it is great, but because it is just an essential movie to watch to complete your movie portfolio. I would advise intense movie fans to buy it and study it, because it is a great movie, just not from the typical movie goer's point of view.",8,1,5,23 July 2008
Singin' in the Rain," Good Pick Me Up
","Singing in the Rain is the longest movie I ever saw. The reason why is because I had to keep on rewinding to listen to the songs and the hilarious banter over and over again. It took me about 5 hours to watch the first time I saw it. Thank god for rewindable video tapes. Singing in the rain is definitely not the movie that you plan a Friday night around. No, Singing in the rain is the movie that you find in the bottom your movie chest and say 'hey, I have not seen this in a long time.' Then you look at the clock and the next thing you know it is 2 in the morning and you still don't feel tired at all. It is without a doubt the most fun and the best musical ever made, bar none. Every 'movie buff' with an ounce of self respect should see it and love every minute of it.",9,0,1,3 July 2008
Psycho," Wonderful Movie
","Vertigo is defitely Hitchcock's masterpiece from a director's standpoint. It had new and innovative cinematography techniques and a very complex plot line. It was no doubt one of a kind and is still unrivaled by any other thriller because it is impossible to copy it. Psycho is the exact opposite. Psycho was the first true slasher film, but even more, it was the first thriller/horror blockbuster. Sure their had been others before it, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Frankenstein for example, but none of them hit home the same way that Psycho did. Psycho is a triumph for the common movie watcher. It is a movie that any one can enjoy because it is deceptively simple. Even more than that, however, it is probably one of, if not the, most influential films ever. Many films have tried, unsuccessfully of course, to imitate its one of a kind plot and execution. Any slasher film about a family going to a secluded place and being stalked by an invisible killer can be traced back to psycho. But even with the endless copies and even one remake, no movie has ever captured the horror of Psycho. The Exorcist was a text book grossout film, Jaws was scary for frequent beach goers, and Alien was a horrific movie about our friends from outer space. All three of these don't approach psycho for one reason and one reason alone: The Shower Scene. It is hard to still get the full efect of the shower scene because there is so little blood. It is nothing compared to some of the brutal murders from movies such as Last House on the Left. It, however, taps a nerve that no one else has, and that is not from too little effort. No, it is great for one reason and one reason alone, it is a SHOWER scene. This is the reason it is so scary. I could not take a shower with the curtain closed for a week after I saw this movie. The reason it is so scary is because most people in America take a shower at least once a day. Sure Jaws is scary, but some people go there whole life time without going to beach. Everyone takes showers. It is also hard for the average person to realize just how vulnerable they are in the shower. This is the reason why this scene is so powerful. It uses an event that happens in many households every day. This is what sets psycho apart and this is why it is so unique. So, in conclusion, My advise to any slasher film fans is to watch Psycho, love Psycho, worship Psycho.",10,0,1,22 July 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Made me Mad
","I saw this movie the weekend after I saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, and they were both, by far, the most hyped up movies of the summer. Well if you've read my Harry Potter review, then you know my feelings towards that film. My feelings towards this one is perhaps even worse. In all fairness, I entered this movie with the promise that it was 'even better than the Dark Knight' from one of my friends. The first thing that didn't make sense is the premise that the government somehow smoothed over the final scene in the last movie. It was one of the biggest cities in the world, packed with people. It is NOT POSSIBLE to erase a giant robot battle from every person New Yorks mind. I guess they borrowed the giant mind eraser that the men in black kept in their basement? The next thing I did not like was how they portrayed Megan Fox. SHES HOT, WE KNOW. The very first scene has her straddling a motorcycle, completely unnecessarily I might mention. But the thing that took the cake, that totally floored me, and made me openly laugh at the movie screen was when they find the old robots. You know the ones that were apparently hiding in Petra for billions of years and we did not notice. Forget all the research weve made on the place, we somehow missed three giant robots inside it. But no, the story didn't stop there, no, the director decided to take it one step further and say there was a giant ray gun in the pyramids of giza. You mean to tell me that one of the most studied and oldest structures in the whole world was actually made to house a GIANT LASER and we never noticed it? This movie is definitely not as bad as im making it sound, Im just venting the anger and exasperation that I fealt after I had to watch Harry Potter and this two weekends in a row. People should see it, but make sure they have 3 loooooong hours to spare (no joke it is about 2 and a half hours long). And I would not recommend, healthwise, that people should watch this and Half Blood Prince back to back.",5,0,4,17 October 2009
Wedding Crashers," surprisingly funny
","I'm not a guy who usually goes for the gay and sexual humor. This is not because I am a prude, but because these kinds of movies tend to take it too far and just isn't funny after that point. Wedding Crashers, however, executed this brand of humor perfectly. Another plus that makes this movie an above average comedy is the fact that the comedy did not take away from the plot. Many movies, such as Animal House, go so out of their way to be funny that they forget that movies are meant to tell a story. Wedding Crashers did a great job of keeping the comedy in the realm of a specific plot. Wedding Crashers is a unique and fun movie and I would definitely recommend watching it.",8,5,6,17 July 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Amazing Movie
","I really like the book To Kill A Mockingbird. It is very good and very socially conscious. The first time I sat down to watch this movie I was thinking 'there is no way that they could have fit every aspect of the book into a one or two hour movie.' I was wrong. This movie is without a doubt a masterpiece. Atticus is played perfectly. We also have the rare, unexpected, and perfectly executed knife scene with Boo Radley, which is every bit as good as The Shower Scene(thats saying something). There are only two other movies that have caught the courtroom and made it as dramatic as this movie. One, obviously, is 12 Angry Men, and the other is A Few Good Men. There is one enexerable truth, this movie deserves every bit of the hype given to it and more. I would recommend everybody(even people who do not like movies) see this movie.",9,1,2,23 July 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Heart Wrenching Movie
","The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. You can tell it is a great movie from the very beginning. Unlike many movies of the same type, the main character gets away, and the main villain gets what was coming too him. The Scene where Andy escapes is one of those scenes that will stick with you for a long time. It is without a doubt one of my favorite movie scenes. The way he is just stripping his clothes and throwing them on the ground, it really gives you a since for how emotional a moment it is for him. When he looks up at the sky, it just makes you want to cry. Hey that rhymed. Anyway, everyone should see this movie.",9,0,0,25 July 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Methodical Thriller Brought up to Speed
","I am a man that enjoys his thrillers. If a director can make a good thriller that actually goes into the psychosis of a person, then it will usually hook me. Vertigo and The Game are two examples of these kinds of films. These films, however, could be considered slow by the new age of movie goers. Silence of the Lambs really takes over where Vertigo finishes. They are two very similar movie (yes, I said similar). You have a man who has gone insane, with a mysterious past and nothing left to lose. This man manipulates a woman into relaying many of her secrets, and ultimately allowing him so far into her mind that he starts to change her. The relationship between Hannibal Lector and Clarice is very similar to the relationship between Vertigo's two protagonist( to me anyway). The one big difference between the two is the violent nature of the plot, and the speed at which Lamb's is delivered. This is not necessarily a bad thing for either movie. Lamb just takes a more 90s spin on a classic genre and idea. It is, in my mind, the best fusion of horror and psychological thrillers that has been made so far. I would definitely recommend people seeing it, and even buying it, if they like it of course. And I would also recommend seeing the sequel Hannibal.",8,0,0,29 October 2008
Rear Window," Good movie, but not a masterpiece
","I had a relatively blah rating of Rear Window on here a couple years back, and now I am compelled to re-write my review. You might say that that is the sign of a good movie, something that continues to get better over time. The brilliance of Rear Window is in two things.The first is the fact that it is incredibly hard to be bored by it, as there are several plot lines going on at once. Obviously the two ones we are most drawn towards are the one of two main characters and the one of the murderer, but there are also 4 more linear plots going on at all the other windows. They are all realistic as well. Even though realistic plots is a staple of Hitchcock films, Rear Window almost seems more realistic than most Hitchcock films.The second reason it is a masterpiece is the viewpoint. Roger Ebert addresses this in his review, but we are given the viewpoint of Jeffries while he looks at his neighbors. This highlights another Hitchcock staple, his ability to make the audience relate to people that we should not be relating to. If we were looking at the story from the third person then we might look down on Jeffries, but since it is in the first person we naturally downplay the creepiness of Jeffries' actions because we inherently think that we are doing it as well.",9,0,3,23 July 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Perfect Fantasy
","Lord of the Rings is perhaps the best book to turn into a movie by todays standards. It has all of the elements that would make a great fantasy, with the sword fights and battles straight out of king Arthur. It has a little something for everyone. And, now that special effects have progressed to the point that they are at now, it is possible to pull of a movie like Lord of the Rings. And, in the end, all three movies ended up just as Tolkein had intended them. Sure, there were some things left out( such as Tom Bombadill), but the overall plot and fun was not sacrificed. This is a movie that Lord of the Rings purists and people that have never picked up any of the books can both agree on. I would definitely recommend everyone go see this movie as it is the pinnacle of a fantasy, and probably the best one to date. It is also the most successful book adaptation, beating Harry Potter by a mile. It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movies made in modern times, and one of the great exercises in special effects.",9,2,4,25 July 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Quintessential Comedy
","This movie is without a doubt the quintessential comedy. It takes the ancient world of King Arthur and makes it hilarious. I have never seen a movie in which every scene progresses the 'plot' and each scene has some comedic value. This movie does just that. I laughed so hard from start to finish. From 'Bring out your dead' to the Frenchman at the end making fun of King Arthur. This movie is to Monty Python what Animal House is to national Lampoon. The only difference is that Monty Python is, in my opinion, much funnier and less sexual then National Lampoon. And, no offense intended, the British accents just make the film even funnier. So in conclusion, this movie is the funniest movie ever made, and its zaniness will always be remembered. It is timeless, and I would recommend everyone see it.",10,3,4,25 July 2008
