Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You will like, if you're informed and desensitised.
","Firstly, Cohen is a smart man, and his humour propelled him very quickly to the forefront of UK TV comedy, ingratiating himself with younger people (let's say 15 up to 40) in the UK. I am one of those people.This film is an extended spin off from the popular 'Borat' character, originating from 'da Ali G show' on a trip to find out about the country his character looks up to the most, America.His character is racist, prejudiced and sexist, not to mention an outright Bigot and Homophobe, and quickly engages in some truly fascinating mini interviews with various sections of American society. His innocence is sold to the unwitting interviewees who, much like the subjects of Louis Theroux, are exposed completely and unashamedly for who they *really* are.For me this is the genius of the film. Slapstick comedy will make me laugh (and this film bore no exceptions) if I am in the right mood, but personally it took a back seat to the insight we are granted. Characters such as the Frat boys / Homeys and the Pentecosts provide a clear window into what to them is an 'everyday' day. Yes, Borat is a movie-film, but every candid scene stands out: you can't make these people say and behave the way they do, they just do because that's who they are.To say these subjects are ignorant may be a falsehood - some acknowledge either directly or indirectly that their viewpoints may be frowned upon, but carry on regardless.Cohen is a clever and brave man to visualise this film and carry it off .I bet there were some times during production where he doubted it could be done... I could have left out the toilet humour as I don't find it that appealing, but I don't feel it detracted from what I found to be a very witty, daring and unfettered look at the darker side of real people that I had never encountered before. One last thing - remember, humourising offensive topics is the first step toward removing them from society.8/10",8,0,2,12 November 2007
