Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brand loyalty is a powerful force...
","I think a lot of people giving this movie rave reviews are probably in some sort of denial -- after waiting 20 years for the prequel to the (frankly excellent) Star Wars Trilogy, they just cannot come to terms with the fact that this movie is, frankly awful.  It's not just that Jar Jar is annoying, it's not just that Darth Maul is poorly developed and a thinly-veiled aim at the toys market, it's not just that the 'mitichlorians' (or however you spell it) is one of the most ridiculous (and unnecessary) story devices of all time, it's not just that this movie could have been a masterpiece for all ages but instead was only palatable by the under-ten crowd or the terminally brand-loyal.  But all of these things combined to create a landmark to disappointment that will stand for all ages.  Oh well...here's hoping Episode II is a step back in the right direction.",1,21,40,5 August 2000
X-Men," Wow! Is it really *that* good?
","Don't get me wrong -- this movie had some pretty great special effects, a decent story, and (for the genre) above average acting.  But it wasn't *that* good.  Wasn't anyone else bothered by the blatant attempt to set up the sequel at the end?",4,0,0,5 August 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good adaptation, although not without weaknesses.
","I am a little surprised to see this movie as #2 all-time on the IMDb lists. It's a worthy adaptation of the greatest book of the 20th century, but not a fantastic one.  Granted, the book is very difficult to adapt to the screen, and one would probably need 10 movies to really do justice to the complexity and subtlety of Tolkein's world.  But this movie takes a remarkably organic and historical-feeling book and turns it into a Star Wars-type heroic quest. I find it hard to completely forgive the contrivances introduced to make things neat and tidy, and there are some really cheesy moments scattered throughout the movie.  Also, Jackson & Walsh's dialog does not always blend seamlessly into Tolkein's.  It frequently becomes some sort of strange amalgam of 20th-century hollywood cliche and gorgeous shakespearian lines. Finally, Shore's soundtrack, which is wonderful in the dark and scary moments of the movie, is painfully overbearing in the more 'tender' ones.For all this, _FotR_ is a pretty good movie.  There is some wonderful cinematography, and there are several genuinely chill-inducing moments in the film.  Oh, and the Balrog rocks. :)",8,0,0,6 March 2002
The Legend of 1900," Incredibly Uneven...
","In some respects, I found this movie to be highly frustrating. There are a couple of stunningly beautiful scenes in this movie (such as the stormy-piano scene) and the duel between Jelly Roll Morton and 1900 is great. Tim Roth plays his character with pathos and charm, and whenever he has a speaking part, he dominates the screen (particularly notable is the discussion he and Max have near the end of the movie). Finally, the piano music is just wonderful, start to finish.But, some of this movie is highly clichÃ©d, particularly some of the dialog -- which is surprising, considering just how philosophical and wonderful some of the other dialog is. There are some pretty gaping plot holes (and I don't consider myself to be a plothole-seeking pedant by any stretch of the imagination...they're just really hard to miss). And honestly, the acting by pretty much everyone *but* Tim Roth is pretty mediocre.What to say? It's hard to reconcile all this. This is both of one the most beautiful and most irritating films I've seen in a long time. I give it an 7/10 because the beautiful parts are so beautiful, but I could easily have given it a 4/10 because the flawed parts are so flawed. It's no Cinema Paradiso, but I'd say it's worth watching in spite of its flaws.",7,1,5,10 March 2005
