Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Pope's fart isn't necessarily holy
","Who reads the backgrounds knows that the script wanted bill to kill the wedding guests. It was the minute before taking the scene that Tarantino decided to have Bills contract killers it done... to me it explains why I couldn't figure the logic behind it. Neither did I find one behind the fact that this supposed world class killer Kiddo EVERY time is fooled by her victims and only by one chance or another survives... Which completes the picture: Urma may confuse the hormones of many men, mine she doesn't. Thats why I could concentrate on the film and what I saw was an urban woman in her twenties that did not know how to handle a sword nor had the charisma that matches a determined killer. (A minimum requirement even for an absurd plot, I would say).What some other pictures of Tarantino have and the reason why I will repeat them to watch till my end of days are the charismatic characters in it. Without exception, you have to love them, the good, the bad as well as the ugly. In Kill Bill? Marginally the sheriff, Budd and ...more just don't come to my mind... There was no spell and some nice shots or funny details (the best: the dead body in the coffin has his hand risen so a rabbit head-shadow is casted on the lid) didn't keep me awake. Disappointing how money and/or fame (or whatever) have made Tarantino's mind lazy. The story was uninspired, totally profane; a woman has left her friend. He is a killer and reacts freaky. End. LOL! Just silly.As other precedent critics wrote, in 5 years, people remind this piece as they will Roger Rabbit or Wayne's World: something new but nothing to watch ever again.",5,3,5,28 April 2004
Finding Nemo," downright boring
","No, I'm not an animation hater or nonsensitive to sentimental scenes, I loved Shrek. But Finding Nemo never caught me. The colors were dull bright like from a detergent commercial and the characters were flat and not convincing. The plot was hasty and as flat as the characters.
*semi-spoilers*What is the point about vegetarian sharks? It seemed, yes, silly. Or did they satirize some prominent vegetarian US activists I don't know of? The blue fish that came with Marlin was not funny but nerving because the jokes were too blunt. What was this weird underwater jet, that does not exist this way, needed for? Also, we would have understood that man is evil (or unnatural; dumb, regarding to nature) without giving the human characters such an awkward wooden appearance. All this important details were so unnecessary that they appeared arbitrary, far too far-fetched, not well reconsidered and therefore disturbing.Probably not intended but nevertheless fitting to the educational mission Walt Disney productions often suffer of: the sledgehammer moral. This time: 'Trust the abilities of your kid, otherwise you will be in trouble'. Is okay but in this movie again, administered with the club.I don't need to mention the animations: but for the colors and the wooden humans brilliant! Excellent, excellent realistic animal movement, absolutely stunning. This made the movie worth watching for me. The plot and the characters, alas, remained underdeveloped.5 out of 10",5,1,2,21 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Bill sh*t
","It started quite promising (weird, surprising, funny situations) but hen  - yawn- it became one of those B-movies Tarantino obviously watches too much. C'mon, be honest, just because Pulp Fiction was one of the best movies ever made, Kill Bill I doesn't qualify for the top 250. I was really trying to like it but in the end just felt empty and disappointed, like after an expensive concert that did not match the expectations.
Seems Tarantino was too much in love with his movie and could not decide what to leave and let. Cut half of it and make one movie of both parts may be then it looses its spoiling lengths and becomes entertaining. But even then - acting will not become better...Thurman was not moving very convincing as a samurai e.g.",7,0,1,10 December 2003
Donnie Darko," horror section?
","Thats right, like other people, I walked by the movie in the horror section in the rental store until I noticed it in the IMDb top 250. Having rent it, I don't understand why it is categorized like this. Watch it. The pace and the distance (and the beautiful photography) is somehow like in 'American beauty', the plot is weird but worth giving it a try. Having seen it 5 minutes ago, I rate it 8 out of 10. Nice! Great acting, beautiful cinema, no cheap effects.",8,0,0,31 January 2004
