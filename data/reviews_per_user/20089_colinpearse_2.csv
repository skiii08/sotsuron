Requiem for a Dream," Breathtaking drug tale
","This is an astoundingly truthful and honest depiction of drug use and abuse; and the way society deals with it. Still (unfortunately) relevant today and I fear will still be relevant in the future. It a beautiful story of addiction in all its forms woven around a story of precarious triumph; where easy gains from illegal drugs (made profitable merely by the virtue of being prohibited) can turn into an easy descent when that scarce commodity becomes scarcer. And when almost all seems lost, it shows an unsympathetic society can go further and take the rest. A damning indictment of a society that would rather fund incarceration than treatment (money well spent the sanctimonious may cry). Even the unwary and innocent are not spared as they are sucked too into the same vortex of self-abuse and addiction, only to be abused more by the cack-handed therapy of the day. A symphony of human misery. A masterpiece.",9,0,1,16 January 2010
Avatar," It could have been a classic
","I seem to be in a minority who believes that a film's score depends on many factors. Some of which undoubtedly get 9/10. These include the obvious like special effects and direction. However, plot and imagination score poorly, as do dialogue and clich√© avoidance. It's fine to take coral reefs as inspiration for an extraterrestrial jungle but it isn't new; neither are floating rocks; illuminating the ground with each step is a tribute to Michael Jackson, I get that; alien sex, which is much like ours only taller; horses with extra legs (come on!); and dragons!? Are our human minds so limited that artists have to fall back on mythical creatures? I might be judging unfairly here. Maybe we've conceived of all we are able to conceive for marketable films. Anything else just wouldn't sell.And then there's the plot. The good guys win. I've clicked on 'contains spoilers' just in case no one knew. Okay, so maybe the question is how. And that is another of my gripes about this movie. Strength won the day. The more woolly among us may say the forces of nature or forces of good intentions did but you only have to scratch the surface of this very superficial and moralising plot to see that winning didn't happen without it. No cleverness or ingenuity, just brute force. The irony is is that this is a sanctimonious movie with an unintentionally gloomy moral.After seeing the way the majority voted (and I include my own 6/10 vote in that) I think the abiding moral for producers might be; make a movie with lots of bright colours and flashing lights and you're onto a winner.",6,8,15,16 January 2010
