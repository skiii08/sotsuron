The Blair Witch Project," As the promo said, scary as hell.
","This was a movie I had to see, just from the previews on T.V. I bought the tape, although I've moved to digital now, and I wasn't sorry. It gripped me like no other I've ever seen, and truly scared the hell out of me. Five years later, I still don't like the woods. I just wish there had been more to it, and I didn't like the second one at all. A great film can only be made once. How about some 'newly found footage' for a sequel? The realism of the acting, the unseen menace, all combined with the idea of using (at the time) unknown actors to keep you guessing to the end. I just have one question: What was in the bundle of rags that Heather found outside the tent after Josh was taken? I have heard it was everything from an ear, to teeth. No one who offers an opinion on this seems to be able to see it clearly. Or was that the idea, keep us guessing? Very cleaver..... I see!",Null,0,1,17 July 2004
