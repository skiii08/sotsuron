Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good Flick
","I thought it was good.  I know having such a young major character did not help the ratings on this film.  The worst part of the whole thing is nobody really cares how Darth Vader came to be except psychologists.  The only downer part from the original 3 Star Wars was when we see Vader take his mask off. Now we have to watch 3 films about his childhood.Still, Star Wars is still great.  Amidala, Qui gon, Obi, and the capes are all interesting.  The underwater world, the race, and Darth Maul are cool. Portman's sincerity as an actress shines.  Jar Jar makes the young ones happy, lets give him a break.Hate the metaclorian stuff but liked the 'your under arrest.'  The new Attack of the Clones jumps all over the place and has no real story, little fun, and overpopulated but it is still Star Wars.  I give Phantom the edge and I am totally sick of seeing the long faced masked clones in 2 films. I would like to have seen Amidala take out a 357 magnum and blow Dooku away.
Could it be true that Dooku is actually Vader and the Vader we saw killed in the old series was just a clone to fool luke.  Vader may return in episode 7 and Hans Solo (Harrison Ford will come back to play Hans).  Episode 7 will be called Vader Lives.",10,2,4,1 June 2002
The Ring," 10 is the score for Ring.
","Fine horror film that is also a thinking persons mystery.  I found it was even better the second time because because less time is spent figuring out the interesting mystery.  This is Hitchcock meets Carpenter meets Castle meets Hammer. Better than the other horror film out now called Below.  The Ring slightly reminds me of Frailty another fine film. The girl I was with was hyperventilating.Of course this film won't please those people seeking gory murder movies and the usual fools who cackle and laugh  to draw attention to themselves may bother you.  This is not about thrills watching people murdered or tortured. This film may not satisfy those who seek an agenda.  This film is intelligent but scary.  This film is modern but not at all driven by political correctness. Actually the lack of gore makes it appropriate for most ages.  It is just a good story that is very supernatural  dark and brooding.All and all the audience was riveted to this film.  The second viewing of this film most of the loose ends can be figured out.  Slight spoiler: The film has an excellent payoff, better to me than 6th Sense or the Others. But I would have liked it to go on longer perhaps for a final confrontation if you know what I mean!  I hope the sequel doesn't ruin it.  One thing: the seven days to death after seeing the video tape may also refer to those of us who rent the Ring.  Chill!",10,0,0,2 November 2002
Elf," Jesus loves Santa Claus
",This is an amazing movie.  There is no agenda or political correctness. This is not the type of film that is  preaching one way or another.   It is not trying to influence kids and has no bad or negative attitude.  It is not cynical.  Also it is funny.  It is not gross out humor or violent humor.  It is more of old fashioned humor and is not disgusting.  I was very surprised.  I expected some kind of agenda like the animal rights in Finding Nemo or the Native American worship in Spirit.  This film is really good.  It is a classic in the line of Miracle on 32nd Street and It's a Wonderful Life.A human is raised by elfs and the real Santa.  He comes to New York and his enthusiasm meets those who have lost the Christmas spirit.  It reminded me a little of Bruce Almighty but this is entirely acceptable for kids and all ages loved it.,10,0,1,12 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Big News, Anakin is not Vader and was never really killed
","The rumour is out here that Anakin does not turn out to be Darth Vader. Wow.  Everyone is falling for the idea that Anakin is Vader.  Apparently, Count Dooku will clone Anakin and even when Luke thinks he is speaking to his father he is just speaking to a clone.  Actually Luke never really got the real Darth Vader.  Vader continues to live and reappears all the way in episode 7.  The real Darth Vader is Count Dooku played by Christopher Lee.  Note at the end of Episode 2 Dooku is standing very tall when Vader's evil theme song is played. This twist will be one of the great surprises in movie history.  There is inside information on this.Christopher Lee will rock as Vader.  Also Harrison Ford may return as Hans Solo in 2007 to have an ultimate battle with the real Vader.",5,0,1,31 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not intense, but still Star Wars
","This is the only Star Wars we have.  It is one of the 3 movie set that seems dedicated to basically give us a biography of a bad guy and kind of depressing at points.  Although he seemed a lot more scary and powerful when there was still a mystery to him in the original series.   Clones has a tremendous amount of talking and courtship that it keeps cutting back to.  Ideas of honor, nobility, justice, wisdom, and freedom are all but ignored.  Thank the force that we have the Senator who seems Jedi herself and Obi. The saber fight is cool but I liked the final Saber fight in Phantom Menace better and Menace was probably a little better than many say.  I don't plan on watching Clones over and over again like with Phantom.  There is no Qui Gon here.  Of course it is no secret that these prequels show how the Empire came to be and the resistance.  One other thing is that space suddenly seems a little claustrophobic but in reality it is a vast expanse in which the Jedi will always fight for the ideals of the force.  So far It is not until Luke that these higher purposes are really born.",5,0,1,20 May 2002

Save the Last Dance," Emergency Room
",The stereotype of the emergency room says it all. All poor African Americans which is suppose to shock the middle class European American girl. Suburbanites might fall for this lucky suburban whites verses unfortunate inner city African Americans.  Of course in real life run down emergency rooms and welfare offices are filled with all races.The film really seems to be trying to evoke sympathy.  To Sir with Love or even Slender Thread are far better.  Even Flash Dance portrays the lead with far more intelligence. I don't even (spoiler) know why he would go back to her after the goofy argument.,3,1,2,23 June 2002
Spider-Man," Spiderman more Jedi than the Jedi in Clones
","This is a fine film that draws you in with a real story and great action and ideas.  Excellent acting especially from the uncle, Goblin, aunt, and even the Newspaper Editor.  Durnst was the young girl also in Jumanji and it is interesting to see her older here.      Interestingly, this film grabs at the ideas of Luke Skywalker from the old Starwars and is not ashamed of it.  This film even seemed to satisfy most of the usual hecklers and people who laugh at all the wrong times at so many movies.  Also, many people leaving the new Star Wars mentioned that Spiderman is a better movie.  We really wanted Star Wars to be great. Spiderman has a strong plot line but does not skip the characters either. I look forward to the sequel.",10,0,0,20 May 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Modern Day Rebel Without a Cause
",This was a real good flick.  Never boring with lots of action and some interesting twists.  I never really knew where this film was going and who might betray who.  Also the acting was very good even to the smallest part. James Dean Lives and even the nervous mechanic was much like Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause.  Great movie.,10,0,1,29 June 2001
Resident Evil," Way Over Rated
","This film starts good.  It leaves you wondering until it all starts to make sense.  Unfortunately most of the most interesting characters get killed too early.  There is some suspense and some strong music.  Many parts of the film are more gut wrenching than suspenseful.  This movie is mostly grim and depressing especially in the last half. You walk out feeling kind of down and a little sick.  Even Milla is a little over rated.  She is not that pretty with a weird nose.  She has very little personality either.  And all the graphic cuts and bruises are a real turnoff.She is no comparison to Angelina Jolie, the Mummy star, or even the excellent lead actress in Ghosts of Mars.  I should say the other brunette female lead in the film who was also in Fast and Furious and Girl Fighter is very good with a powerful personality.  But the 'I want to kiss you bit..' line is stupid.  I much preferred John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But you need to like Carpenter to like that film.  Resident Evil is just more depressing than it needs to be.",3,0,1,31 March 2002
Seabiscuit," kids did not like it.
",The first half of the film as slow.  It also was confusing for youngsters even teens.  I have read this film is for everyone but the hooker scenes and the bullfight you might want to avoid for the kids.  Also he makes himself throw up and lots of swearing.  The last half of the film was much better when the horse finally entered. The first part was needed for the story but could have been cut a half hour. The final race was very crucial to the whole film.  I would say this is worth seeing especially for the last half of the film.  Bridges might get nominated for this role.,6,0,0,1 August 2003
28 Days Later...," nasty
","If you enjoy watching dead bodies in churches, watching preists as disgusting zombies, and long scenes of burning people then you might like this.  Spoiler, Also our hero kills her best friend with an axe and someone says why did you do that?  She says he might have been a zombie so we chopped him to ribbons.  This could have been good and is no comparison to Omega Man or Last Man on Earth.  We walked half way through.",Null,0,0,13 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," We are not that rotten in zion
",We are not that bad.  Yes there was some feel of the Ten Commandments at the speech by Zion.  But in this film the people of Zion are not worth saving after their disgusting mush scene.  The human race is not very likable as portrayed in the film which makes it very hard to want to see Zion saved.They jump around and have a goofy love scene as preparation for the final conflict and we hardly feel like this is a noble cause. Cause to save what? Reeves is always trying to get a quick kiss thus he does not really seem like the chosen one after we see his washed out computer cafe type groupie. The weird French chic and French guy seem out of some artsy underground film.The action though is cool.  It is not the type of intensity of the individual battles of the first one. It does have a number of good action moments.  Jackie Chan should have been in this in Matrix meets Chan. It is worth seeing but needed to cut some of the talk and all of the mushy parts.  The philosophy and action is fine.  Is choice an illusion?  I say choice is not an illusion.,Null,0,0,7 November 2003
Vanilla Sky," Do not take a date
","This is not erotic but a real turn off.  The crude dialogue is more like a health class.  This film  is like a cross between Phantom of the Opera, Truman Show, Bergman, Fellini, Play Misty for me, and Falling Down.  It is only worth it if you see a few others that day.  I saw no chemistry either, but there were some twists and turns. It was really grim at times.",1,1,5,15 December 2001
Bruce Almighty," Carrey's best
",Funny but meaningful story with secret referrals to movie history.  This is Frank Capra like with a very good story and not cynical.  Carrey shines through out.  This is great for all ages especially for believers.   This film could make you one.Carrey is himself here and you can see that the role is probably how he really acts in real life.  Comic talent shines here in this funny but sincere film.,10,0,2,30 June 2003
Jurassic Park," Was It The Best
","Jurassic Park was surely a tremendous ground breaking event. Spielberg is at his best here.  The special effects are fantastic and each scene has a special tension and effect of its own.  Spielberg weaves a magic web and pleases everyone in the process.  He puts in a few things here and there to please the more liberal in the audience as well as the more traditional.  He even sends messages to the critics with words such as sexism to try and appease the media critics.Spielberg also has us rooting against every one who dies and for everyone who lives.  He even gets the audience to laugh hysterically while a person is torn apart.  In fact a number of people complained that there was not enough gore in Jurassic Park 3.  If you are looking for gore than you will get much more with this film than with JP3.  There was a more gritty tone with this film than with JP3. We got to see cows and other animals eaten alive in detail. But beyond the appeasement of those who need to be convinced of realism through gore and other methods, it is with action that Spielberg excels.  Fantastic use of sound and special effects make this film a thrilling event.  Spielberg has shown he is the king of action even on the small budget of Duel.  I was reminded of the terror invoked through the shaking of the ground and the loud sounds of a dinosaur walking. 
Jurassic Park was about terror and fear while JP3 was about adventure.  JP3 was a thrll ride in which the audience wishes it was on the island while Jurassic Park we were more in a state of fear.  JP3 was full of imagination and excitement and we really cared about the characters.  The smart kid in JP1 was more enjoyable than the crying kids in JP1.  Those who say he could not have survived because teenagers are dumb would probably be the same ones who at one time said women were unable to do anything.  Anyway JP3 was just an adventure that really found redeeming value in every character where JP1 just killed off all the creeps. I was also reminded that Jurassic Park was a statement movie.  The statement being that people should not clone creatures or try and create monsters similar to the ideas in Frankenstein.  JP3 was more like Dracula in that it had no real statement.  JP3 was really about whether or not the characters would escape with their son similar to whether or not one could survive a night in Dracula's castle.  So JP3 was more of a good old fashioned scary adventure and about imagination.  It really depends on what you like.  JP3 also was at a disadvantage being the second sequel but was still very exciting.  Personally, I give a slight edge to JP3 because I just enjoyed it more, though it definately could have been a little longer and would have been even better had Jeff Goldblum been in it.",2,2,44,3 August 2001
