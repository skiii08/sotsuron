Mission: Impossible III," Great Stuff
","Mission impossible 3 is the best sequel I have seen till date. The entire film, from start to finish is action packed and excellent special effects award this movie its success. It is simply marvelous. Tom Cruise has the audience captivated from the word go. The start of the film creates mystery and intrigue and this continues throughout the film. The nail biting action sequence is sure to keep you at the edge of your seat and not to mention your eyes glues to the screen. Mission Impossible is exactly what a sequel should be BIGGER AND BETTER! The supporting cast is great. Everyone performs their 'mission' amazingly and makes Mission impossible 3 a well rounded film. For those who have not seen Mission Impossible 3 as yet.THIS 'MISSION' IS TOP SECRECT AND ONLY ENJOYED IN CINEMAS See you at the movies",10,0,1,9 May 2006
