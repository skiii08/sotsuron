The Blair Witch Project," The hype machine turns out a winner (for once)
","I finally saw this movie following weeks of frustration (the movie theatres in this little backwater tend to sell out ridiculously fast).  Saying it was worth the wait is something of an understatement.  The hype and myths surrounding this modern horror masterpiece are, for once, understandable and well-founded.  I have often been downright terrified by watching horror films alone at home on video (Repulsion, Halloween, and The Haunting - the old one - are three that readily come to mind), but this was the first instance where I was absolutely terrified in an actual theatre.  The pace of the film is masterful, letting us relax and laugh fairly often near the beginning, then slowly and inexorably tightening its grip until the absolutely terrifying final moments.  A great big thumbs-up to its innovative and resourceful creators - here's wishing them a lot of luck on their next film!",9,1,2,21 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Unjustifiable exploitation film masquerading as 'art'
","What if this film had been made exactly as it is seen today by someone other than Steven Spielberg?  What would the critics be saying?  I have a feeling they would be telling the screenwriter to go back to college and learn about dialogue, story thrust, plausibility, and characterization - four things that this awful, exploitive drivel singularly lacked.  I feel they would also be telling the director that if you open a film with 40 minutes of sickening violence that you had better be prepared to justify it later on. The most disheartening thing about all of this is that Spielberg no longer seems to care what his films are saying, only that they make a big enough noise to be 'important'.  Following the unwatchable opening, we get extremely trite symbolism, poor dialogue, and wooden acting in service of a badly presented story, all leading up to another unwatchable sequence, followed by a coda which suggests that all of this unnecessary carnage is a great, noble, and patriotic thing.  In doing this, Spielberg aligns himself with the Nazis that his own 'Schindler's List' abhorred....remember, the Nazis were the kings of patriotism and nationalism.  The most offensive aspect of this film, then, is its utter pretentiousness.  At least exploitation movies don't pretend to be anything but what they are.  This one, sadly, has delusions of grandeur (and although this criticism can't be levelled at the film itself, Spielberg's utterly arrogant acceptance of his Oscar for best director confirms all of my worst suspicions - compare it to his humble, tearful acceptance of the well-deserved Oscars for 'Schindler's List').  Since no one around Mr. Spielberg seems to have the courage necessary to tell him when the emperor has no clothes on, the responsibility falls to the critics and audiences.  Let him know you're tired of his version of 'reality'.",3,1,4,21 August 1999
Pi," White Light/White Heat
","Until reading some of the reviews posted here, I must admit I had never thought of the 'Eraserhead' comparison (you learn something new every day). The more I think about it now, the more the film seems like 'Eraserhead' if Lynch had taken a rather large quantity of speed and a crash course in mathematics.  Which is unfair.  In actuality, the film has little in common with 'Eraserhead''s elegant cinematography and deliberate pace.  This movie is, above all, a portrait of obsession.  The ending is a bit too easy, but up until that point the film creates an utterly believable atmosphere of impending madness.  The grainy photography and hyperkinetic cutting are crucial.Other than that, not too much more to say about this one.  An 'art house' film it may be, but it's one of the more interesting ones I've seen in the past several years.  And to pass on a compliment to Aronofsky (paraphrasing Harry Crews), 'I'll certainly see the next thing you direct'.",9,1,3,7 November 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Remarkable and human
","As a fan of Roberto Benigni since the marvelous Rome sequence in Jarmusch's 'Night on Earth', I must say that this is the film where he truly graduates to the level of auteur.  His simple, understated direction and outrageous comic presence merge perfectly into a film that is never downbeat, despite its grim subject matter.Although I haven't hit on the correct answer as to why three of the five nominees for the Academy's best picture award were stories of World War II, I feel this film easily outdistances the other two.  While 'Thin Red Line' was a little too cold in its pursuit of technical perfection (but just a little), and Spielberg's 'epic' floundered in hideous nationalism and bad writing, this is the only film of the three to really confront a recognizable human cost to the catastrophe.  Not a bad moment in the film, not an unmoved eye in the theater.Oh, just one more thing....there is also a marvelous, classic, lilting score by Nicola Piovani - one of the best I've heard in a film in years!  Buy the album!",Null,1,2,11 October 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," One of the finest of an exceptional career
","Stanley Kubrick made a great many masterworks in his life, possibly more than any other film auteur of the last 50 years.  Included among that impressive list is his final film 'Eyes Wide Shut'.  I will not attempt to describe the film here or offer any real insight into the deep-rooted motivations of the characters or of the director (it would take many more words than I am allowed here and I still wouldn't be able to discuss half of it).  Rather, I will simply say that the film has very little in common with the way it has been described in the press or by Kubrick himself.  Empty your mind of all that and prepare to watch the most gorgeously-lensed, superbly-acted, meaningful film you're likely to see this year or any other for that matter.  As so often with Kubrick the term 'masterpiece' is in no way misapplied.  See it twice!",10,0,0,22 August 1999
Ran," Simply the finest of the fine
","I really have very little to say that others who fervently love this film have not already said.  Even though he went on to make three other (highly underrated) films after this, 'Ran' stands as Kurosawa's crowning achievement, and possibly his finest film.  It moves with the assurance of an epic, yet the grace of a finely wrought personal drama.  Simply one of the finest films ever made.Although the cast is uniformly excellent, special mention must be given to the performance of Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede.  Rarely in modern film has such an evil and unsympathetic character been rendered with such an unerring pathos.  Kudos to Harada (who would have won an Oscar with this performance in an English-language film) and to Kurosawa for making this one of the indisputable cornerstones of film art.",10,1,3,27 November 1999
Cube," What was that about the ending?
","I will take the high road here and not mention by name the reviewer who wrote that the (I'm quoting directly) 'retard squealing' made him not enjoy the film.  But I would like to take issue with those who feel the ending is a letdown.I recently had a debate with a friend who felt that 'The Blair Witch Project' was a disappointment only because of the ending.  Her position was that the film was utterly pointless because the ending was ambiguous, whereas my point of view has always been that (for horror films anyway) an unexplained ending is often the key to a frightening film.  To me, the ending of 'Cube' has that sort of feel.  Sure, one character does offer some sort of plausible explanation, but I'm not sure I trust it, and I think the explanation is more to provide the film with an extra layer of metaphoric significance than to explain the origins of the 'cube'.  No, the actual ending is not exactly profound, and I don't believe it has any religious symbolism attached to it.  But doesn't anyone but me find a bit of Rod Serling irony in it?Overall, I was rather surprised at the vitriolic attacks on the movie appearing in this review section.  It is not perfect, but the movie is more original in theme and structure than virtually any science fiction film of the last ten years ('12 Monkeys' excepted).  And to respond to the reviewers (more than one) who claim that this is not worth watching because 'Lifeboat' was so much better:  It's a shame we shouldn't watch 'Goodfellas' because 'The Godfather' was there first.",9,0,1,7 November 1999
