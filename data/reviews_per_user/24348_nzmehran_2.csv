Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not Funny and nil
",I should say 7.6 for this movie is way too much! I just can't figure out how it is that much famous i tried to finish it 3 times but i couldn't! first of all it isn't funny at all and when it insults another nation with its stupid jokes oh man it was really disgusting and dialogs and messages were so childish and overstated made for 11-12 teenagers like gay people could live freely in the U.S or women could vote and live freely and blah blah BS and the worst scene is when he was speaking with that professor PhD guy everybody knows U.S has those things and yeah those are good so cut the crap man! well there isn't really anything else to say boring and nil that's it,1,2,4,11 August 2010
300," 300=Alexander=Racism
","A guy said we Persians always complain about small things like the movie Alexander that we said why we were defeated so easily!!!That's so weird man let me expand this a little bit! Dude try to comprehend,it is racism when Anthony Hopkins said 'It was madness 40000 of us against 250000 barbarians(Persians) ' or the child in the class said 'Why are the Persians are so cruel' or 'But if we are superior to the Persians as you say' or the princess Roxana was a black girl(not that being black is a bad thing but when do you want to understand we are not fu**ing black nor Arab we are Persians) with a very bad attitude (even a dishwasher doesn't behave that way for the f***'s sake she was a princess) this scene just showed how much sick director hated us and of course when the Alexander before the war shouted for 'Freedom and glory ' oh man give me a break was he really fighting for freedom of course it is historically inaccurate! So wait a minute is that just a DejaVu or these two movies just are trying to convey similar messages?! They are even similar in other aspects like when Alexander's childhood when he was trying to be a Greek Warrior lol BTW thanks goodness both movies are so lame and laughable! PS: There are two kinds of history about Iran 1-Iran before Islam 2-Iran after Islam Don't fu** with the first one with your fu**ing movies because it doesn't matter if we are Muslim, Jew, Christian , Infidel, Zoroaster  we are all so sensitive about it.",1,3,7,9 August 2010
