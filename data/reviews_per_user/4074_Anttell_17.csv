Blade Runner 2049," There's a lot of good here
","Sequel to the philosophical scifi noir masterpiece is a fairly worthy successor - more of a biblical story where as the first one dove deeper into the subject of humanity. Loved the score here, some of the cinematography, and the mostly brief action bursts are done in an impeccable style. Villeneuve was definitely a good fit to direct the film. I would've prefered that there wasn't a link to the original's story and altogether it's not a bullseye of a film for me. It could have been a deeper affair and it sometimes looked too polished, but it's definitely recommendable.Rating: 7/10",7,1,6,12 January 2019
First Man," Expected more
","Damien Chazelle's newest film explores ground outside the comfort zone set up by his previous two films. First Man is competently directed - it has some really nice shots, good score segments and many other well made elements. The script, written by Josh Singer (the Post, Spotlight), is unfortunately rather mundane: it takes a look at Neil Armstrong's personal and working life fairly evenly in a very unsurprising fashion - the screenplay is pretty middle of the road biopic-stuff. There's probably a great film waiting to be made about the subject, but this wasn't it for me. It's by no means a bad effort, just feels somewhat uninspired and would've needed a different approach to be something more.Rating: 5/10",5,1,2,1 November 2018
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper's directorial debut
","A Star is Born begins with a superbly shot and superbly loud music performance, and similar scenes are scattered throughout the movie. Bradley Cooper is great in his directorial debut as a deep-voiced alcoholic rockstar, who is supported by another set of best in the business pipes in Sam Elliott, Lady Gaga on the other hand is frustratingly wooden which is probably the main reason I couldn't fully get into the movie and liked it less than I thought I would.I liked the film's ponderings about fame - it takes a look of people behind their celebrity characters, and in that sense Lady Gaga was an intriguing choice to play Ally as she comes out as a bit of an enigma herself (if only she could act a normal person...). Cooper will always have a soft spot in my heart as I've followed his career already since Alias (2001-2006) when he wasn't a household name yet - it was great to see him hit big with The Hangover (2009) and after that he's really shown his versatility as a drama-actor. As an essay on success in show business, I could see A Star is Born being a particularly personal project for him. It's a well directed, yet somewhat unsurprising film, which is brought down by one bad performance.Fun random facts:
<ul><li>Lady Gaga's first acting credit is from Sopranos (1999-2007)</li><li>The film has performances from three former Alias actors: Cooper, Ron Rifkin and Greg Grunberg</li></ul>Rating: 6/10",6,0,1,29 October 2018
BlacKkKlansman," The Grand Prix winner
","As a finn, I just have to begin this review from a supporting cast standpoint. The character of Felix Kendrickson, an aggressive KKK member, is played by my fellow countryman Jasper Pääkkönen. You certainly wouldn't want to bump into Felix in a dark alley. Pääkkönen has actually played a somewhat similar character in a finnish film called Leijonasydän (Heart of a Lion), a really well made 2013 film about neo-nazis.But back to the BlacKkKlansman...Spike Lee's newest joint starts with images from Gone with the Wind and evolves into an important film about a touchy subject, hopefully this film will be another step forward in the battle against racism. The premise of the story, while being about a serious issue, is giggle worthy - the plan of an african-american police officer infiltrating Ku Klux Klan doesn't necessarily sound like the best of ideas -it's kind of a 'lets wing it' type of deal. The movie is a part comedy but it is tonally a bit more serious than the what the trailers had me anticipating. I also felt that there were a couple of instances where the movie's history telling interfered the pacing and thrillingness of the actual story. BlacKkKlansman has laughs, thrills, importance, shock value and nice portrayal of the period, but for me the film didn't quite come together in the way I would've liked. Still, it's a good film and I'll be watching it again at some point for sure.Rating: 7/10",7,2,5,12 September 2018
Predator," Get to the choppa!
","The Schwarzenegger-classic has a lot to like: muscle flexing, lots of sweat and blood, stupendously loud/big guns and just general high-octane badassery. I've always loved that 80's/90's action movie feel and Predator delivers. It's a well paced film with cool sets, props, practical effects - director John McTiernan was really on a roll at the time as he followed this ultimate testosterone filled classic with another one in Die Hard a year after. Predator is a film for the ages that I like to revisit from time to time. I'll probably be seeing Shane Black's The Predator next week.Rating: 8/10",8,1,1,15 September 2018
Split," The Beast is loose.
","It's alright. Silly, which isn't exactly surprising, but I found it interesting enough, it had some thrills and excitement. Though at some point I was mostly just waiting for the Unbreakable-connection to surface (which turned out to be a bit underwhelming). It's not nearly as good as Shyamalan's earlier work and I also found The Visit to be a lot scarier, but it's ok enough.Rating: 5/10",5,0,1,31 December 2018
Die Hard 2," Fantastic
","An underrated genre-masterpiece. It's been almost 30 years but it doesn't look dated one bit, on the contrary, it looks way better than most of current action.Fun fact: Renny Harlin uses Finland-references in his movies - here it's the Finlandia hymn that is played during the planes landing.Merry Christmas!",9,1,2,23 December 2018
The Favourite," Wigs...a lot of wigs
","I appreciated this more than I actually liked it. An unconventional blend of costume drama and comedy coupled with strong performances and a clever ending which ultimately reveals who wins and who loses or if there even are winners or losers. Emma Stone's kissassery 101 is fun to watch in this Amadeus' (1984) little brother (or sister).Having said that, for me, the film didn't really have laugh out loud moments, nor did it's cleverness make it to the 'awe territory'.Rating: 6/10",6,0,2,18 February 2019
Get Out," Great
","At the same time scary and over the top hilarious. Kudos to Peele, will be interesting to see Us.Rating: 8/10",8,0,2,30 December 2018
Cold War," Fantastic
","A tragic love story for the ages. The film actually had an interesting effect on me: for the past couple of years I've kind of lost my touch to the idea of true love, but this film left a longing feeling inside me and ignited some of that lost passion. Joanna Kulig as Zula is absolutely mesmerizing, such a photogenic actress, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if she made a Hollywood breakthrough in the coming years now once she's had some international fame.This is my number one film of 2018 at the moment and it'll in all probability stay that way.Rating: 9/10",9,1,3,21 February 2019
Silence," Scorsese delivers once again
","Such an intelligent film about humanity, faith, power and legends. I feel it was missing the last little touch that would make it a personal favorite of mine, that remains to be seen, but there simply can't have been many films more profound than this since it's release.Rating: 8/10",8,2,3,27 November 2018
Logan," Bleak stuff
","A sharp screenplay, and the film itself is very much unlike any other X-Men film. The third act isn't on par with the rest, but this is a nice acquaintance for sure.Plus, it features the most badass kid ever.",7,1,1,2 February 2019
La La Land," Wonderful
","I'm doing a bit of catching up with some 2016/2017 titles and La La Land has been one of my most anticipated. The film is absolutely brilliant from every standpoint. Obviously it gets ton of credit for the cinematography, score, songs, etc, but it's all for nothing if it doesn't have emotion...I haven't been this moved by a film in a long time, the 'full of real life' ending is where the film rises to the masterpiece category. There's something bubbling under the happy-go-lucky cover and I kind of got similar nostalgic vibes from the story than what Boyhood (2014) offered.'Audition (The Fools Who Dream)' is a fantastic song that tickles all the right senses. Obviously every review has to also mention the opening scene...done! The two juggernauts of that year's awards season, Moonlight and this, are both something special, but I'd probably give the slight upper hand to La La Land. A very rare four and a half stars out of five from me.",9,1,2,23 October 2018
The Shape of Water," An alternative fairytale
","The Shape of Water looks and sounds amazing: the cinematography with it's vibrant colour palette, the superb production and costume designs, the atmospheric score...they're just perfect. The intelligence of the film is on constant display aswell as the film is a strong love letter to literature and film ('fairytale for grownups' idea, kafkaesque feel, references to film history...). There's some gore and sex, there's historical accuracy mixed with an alternative reality - all in all it's an interesting blend of things. It's also rare for me to feel such empathy towards a character that this film made me feel.After all of the above, it feels borderline criminal to award The Shape of Water 'only' four out of five stars. While there's a lot of almost perfection here, I would've liked the film to be less predictable and amp up the thrills a bit. It felt too calculated. Having said that, for me it's a well deserving best picture winner and I could see my rating go up on a rewatch. At the moment I have Pan's Labyrinth a bit higher of the two celebrated del Toro fairytales.",8,3,9,19 September 2018
The Disaster Artist," Pretty great
","First up, I haven't seen the Room (2003), but of course have heard a lot about it through the years, a friend of mine is a huge fan who takes part in fan screenings and carries bunch of footballs into them...The Disaster Artist portrays Tommy Wiseau as a true enigma, which he no doubt is, he does things in his own 'a bit' peculiar way. We also get to see a person with a big heart and a person in need for a true friend. There's some cheesiness towards the end of the film (not intentional, even if it's about making of the Room), but I enjoyed the movie a lot for it's heart and for the constant laughs it offers. James Franco is great as Tommy, it's so easy to ham this kind of an over the top transformation up, but that's not the case here. A really enjoyable flick.Rating: 8/10",8,3,3,24 October 2018
Green Book," As Sweet as It Gets
","A feel-good movie before anything else, a sweet story with lots of heart. Really wish this kind of a thing would win the Best Picture this year, but it doesn't seem to be in the stars for it. Great chemistry between Ali and Mortensen. Not for cynics.Rating: 7/10",7,2,3,25 January 2019
Annihilation," Out-there
","Alex Garland's debut, Ex-Machina (2014), was an intelligent scifi-piece. The same can be said about Annihilation, though Annihilation has and will be more polarizing among wide audience - I can see many calling it pretentious, even if it possesses many familiar structural details. Earth is under an extraterrestrial threath and a group of scientists/soldiers are sent to investigate. The premise is obviously a familiar one but the film eventually turns into ponderings about life and humanity disguised as a scifi-thriller. The film somewhat reminded me of Denis Villeneuve's Arrival (2016), but Annihilation is more out there with it's intentional and theme appropriate 'weird' atmosphere that stems from it's characters and audiovisual choices.The film has some nice artwork and all in all, for me, it was a pretty interesting viewing and it can be a retrospective grower for sure due to it's distinct atmosphere and thoughts. Still, at the moment I'm kind of on the fence whether I actually liked it or not - eccentric stuff.Rating: 6/10",6,0,1,5 September 2018
