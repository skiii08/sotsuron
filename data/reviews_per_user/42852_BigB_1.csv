The Blair Witch Project," Overrated and not scary, it's still worth seeing.
","This has to be one of the most overrated horror films of all time, and it ended up not being even remotely scary. Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile film to see, and I applaud the fact that it was made. Being from the West Coast where conifers dominate the forests, East Coast forests seem like a park to me; this seriously detracted from the suspense. If they had added a very subtle soundtrack, such as that in 'Twin Peaks', it would have added to the suspense, and wouldn't have subtracted from the documentary feel of the film. Despite these shortcomings, I wasn't bored with the film, nor disappointed that it wasn't frightening for me. I found it far more interesting and enjoyable than many other films these days; in that sense, it deserves its praise.",7,0,1,8 November 1999
