Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The bad parts are bad, but the good parts are really good
","I can't say I was disappointed with this movie, but it definitely could have been better. The Special Effects were INCREDIBLE, better than anything I have ever seen. Some of the dialouge is suspect, and some of the comic relief is very juvenile but it's far from being a bad movie. Some of the stand out scenes, to me, were the Podrace, and The Lightsaber Dual between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul was.....well incredible, once again. Bad things about the movie: not enough Obi-wan, C-3po, or Darth Maul. And WAY, WAY, WAY too much of the very annoying Jar Jar Binks. Sure it is very cool that a totally digital character can blend in so seamlessly, BUT his voice and the way he talks, grammar wise, is annoying from the very first word that come from his mouth. I just hope Episodes 2 and 3 are better. And possibly, if I go see the movie again, it will begin to grow on me.",5,0,1,19 May 1999
