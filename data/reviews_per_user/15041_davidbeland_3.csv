Changeling," A high level of drama
","Wow, that was a hell of a movie!! I don't remember being angry like that while sitting on my couch. I'm not an Angelina Jolie fan at all but the acting in this film is excellent. Great cast and well directed.The plot is very disturbing and i would have killed almost every cops in this story except one. You may want to watch it with a punching bag or a stress ball. A whole lot of cold hearted characters you will love to hate in this film.The police trying to convince a mother that a lying boy is in 'fact' her kidnapped child, how crazy is that?!! Where is Dirty Harry when we need him?!I'm not a horror movie fan like 'Saw' or 'Chainsaw Massacre' or anything like that; THIS is a horror movie, emotionally speaking. The score composed by Eastwood is sober and effective without taking all the place. It's not the kind of movie i will watch twice though because i found it emotionally exhausting due to an high level of drama and realism. Knowing that is a 'true story' makes it even more shocking. Good until the last drop.Thank you M. Eastwood for another brilliant piece of art!!",9,2,3,7 November 2012
Incendies," Too much and not enough.
","For the last 2 years i was saying to myself 'you should see Incendies that everybody is talking about, it must be awesome' and i finally did...The goods: great actors, great cinematography, some strong dramatic scenes, sometimes very realistic. The bads: Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong, way to long, especially the beginning of the film. I didn't care about the characters and i've found myself fighting against boredom for the most part. Nothing really happens until the 48th minute, THE 48TH MINUTE!! I didn't bought the plot in the first place; a twin's odyssey in the middle-east to meet an unknown brother and understand the mystery behind the mental illness of their dead mother; and that's too bad because i wanted to like this movie very hard, but i didn't. The ending is twisted at a point it became ridicule and laughable, i didn't bought that either... Yeah, i know, truth is stranger than fiction, but sometimes fiction pushed too hard is overkill.In my opinion the music didn't fit for a middle-east movie, for the most part at least. I mean, why not include some Twisted Sisters, Bon Jovi and Justin Beiber in the soundtrack once you are there? A bit of 'phrygian dominant' would have helped.I didn't liked the structure either, i think they tried to make it too 'artistical' or something, and it didn't helped the story.If you want your vacation to last longer, that 2 hours and 10 minutes felt like 5 hours, just saying...Not a bad movie, but not that great either. A lot of bones but a lack of meat. Maybe i had too much expectations but in one word : deception.",5,6,17,6 March 2013
War of the Worlds," Some goods, some bads
","You know, when i hear covers of my favourite songs, i expect them to be as accurate as it can be. You can play them in a different style, different keys, take some liberties, change the solos, but don't change the lyrics or the melodies because that's the core of the songs. Same thing with movie remakes.I liked the crescendo of the beginning but it didn't took long before i started to frown.Yes of course all visual aspects are very neat, the cinematography is interesting and the sound design is very cool but the whole wrecked family thing is boring as hell and does not help the story, it seems like they tried to put an unnecessary depth to this and the movie suffers in my opinion. The acting is down to earth enough, i don't like Tom Cruise but i can recognize he's a good actor. Tim Robbins is amazing as always, i didn't expected him to be in this movie at all, great surprise. There's some epic scenes but sometime too much action for nothing and yes, that little girl with the strident voice screaming all the time was really annoying. A lot of clichés in this movie like the single dad with a garage in his messy kitchen having trouble managing his anger and arguing all the time with his rebel and introverted son; it gets old very quickly. At some point Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) tells his daughter to «stay right here i'll be right back» (wow, really? How lame!) then another family took the girl with them by force because they didn't believe the girl's story, i saw that coming from miles away, so unoriginal.There's a lot of incongruities too, like when Ray is looking in the fridge: no light, the next shot: he turn on the light switch to check if there's electricity. The crowd just staying there, staring at the first tripod emerging from the street instead of running like deers, etc...They could have removed only 4 or 5 key scenes and nobody would have notice that this was 'war of the world'. The way they ended the film was so predictable it's embarrassing.In one word: watchable.",5,0,0,27 August 2013
