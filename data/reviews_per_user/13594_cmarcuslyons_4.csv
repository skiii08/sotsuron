The Ring," Great cinematographically; but uneven story
","Stylish, yes, but trying too hard to copy 'The Cell' in many ways.  While this film was hyped as one of the scariest movies since 'The Sixth Sense' (which wasn't actually 'scary' as much as creepy, atmospheric and brilliant!) 'The Ring' falls short on some levels.****Major Plot Spoiler Ahead!!!****With an excellent premise, 'The Ring' pays off huge dividends in tension-building and raising many, many questions--and doing so fantastically.  But. . .'The Ring' did a quick downward spiral to ridiculousness after the climactic scene in which the young murdered girl, who's supposedly doing all the killing somehow, crawls from a television set to murder one of the key characters, my belief...until then having held up well....crawled out of my body and went away.  The imagery and cinematography of 'The Ring' is stunning and would've rated a '10' from me alone had it not been for that one crucial scene, and for the fact that the film leaves far too many questions unanswered at the end.",8,0,0,22 March 2003
Minority Report," Brilliant!
","After 'AI', I was quite reluctant to believe the hype surrounding the Cruise/Spielberg collaboration for 'Minority Report.'  'AI' was such a convoluted, though beautifully filmed, piece of film.  'Minority Report', on the other hand, is not only well-filmed, but it appears to showcase Spielberg in some of his best work to date!  Elegant, thrilling, poignant, and masterful, 'Minority Report' delves deep into the moral quagmire that represents the government controlling 'psychics' and ostensibly putting them to use for their own betterment.  We all know that whenever the government gets involved in any form, something horrid will happen.  Such is the case in 'M.R.'--a good man, Cruise, is taken down like an expendable pawn in a egoistic game of 'show me the money' by his ultimate superiors.  With beaucoup f/x and excellent casting, from Cruise and down through every character, 'Minority Report' is an excellent thriller, and a brilliant masterpiece of filmwork.",10,0,0,21 December 2002
The Bourne Identity," Above Average Thriller!
","**As always, you're in danger of plot spoilers reading beyond this!**Jason Bourne is really, really confused.  He regains consciousness on a ship at sea with a stranger performing impromptu surgery on him.  With no memory of how he'd gotten there, nor who he is, he tries to retrace his life and figure things out.  How surprising, then, to find out that there is someone or someones trying to kill him...and he has astounding self-defense skills he didn't know he had.This is the premise of 'The Bourne Identity'.  Matt Damon's nuanced and sensitive performance of Jason Bourne keeps this thriller from sinking into just another entry in that genre.  When he makes startling discoveries about his past identity, he actually shows it!  *gasp!*  A sensitive, caring assassin?  Who'da thunk it?  As the plot barrels forward with stunning stunts and excellent acting from Damon and his reluctant sidekick, the always phenomenal Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), 'The Bourne Identity' is well worth viewing!",8,0,1,28 January 2003
Signs," Brilliant and Hitchcockian!
","M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a brilliant and wonderful film in 'Signs'. Dare I say that with this specific film he's reached Hitchcockian levels in his writing and directing, and that's no small feat.  ***Reading Further May Spoil The Plot***I dragged my heels in seeing this, thinking 'oh great, yet ANOTHER cliched movie about crop circles.'  From the opening credits to the very last moment, Shyamalan creates an atmospheric and thrilling masterpiece.  Casting Mel Gibson in the lead could've been a huge mistake, but under the artful eye of the director, Gibson gives a nuanced and understated performance as a damaged and faithless former priest.  Joaquin Phoenix as his brother was a casting coup, as Phoenix never fails to give a wonderfully believable performance.  That Phoenix brings a stunning resolution to the plot was another piece of brilliant decision-making.  Exploring the possibilities of alien visitation on earth, Shyamalan manages to subtly portray one possible outcome of such an event without rubbing it in our faces.  Taking his time to unravel the story works well, allowing the viewer to be drawn in in every way.  As Hitchcock also teased his audience with what was to come, Shyamalan uses several techniques to good effect. 
Having viewed this film, I am convinced that M. Night Shyamalan is a filmmaking genius.",10,0,2,26 January 2003
