Miracle," Powerful
","This movie takes you back in history when the unsettled time of war was upon us. The Cold War. But this is not a 'war movie' it's a sports movie. This is the story about a United States unit defeating the Soviet Russians, on ice. The 1980 Olympics took place on U.S. soil, Lake Placid, NY where the U.S. defeated the Soviet Russians to move on to the gold medal round. Very good look at how Coach Herb Brooks studied his enemy and practied like his enemy and dominated his enemy. Fantastic story and non stop action. Will keep you on your edge of your seat. This might be the best true sports movie of all time. It truly is a miracle.",9,0,0,28 February 2020
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Funny
",Even if your not a racing fan or a Nascar fan you still have to watch this. Typical Will Ferrell does not let us down. And being paired up with Jon C. Riley makes him even better. I can guarantee that there were many ad-lib scenes. Basically this is about Ricky Booby a Nascar driver who is very good at his sport. But when a Formula 1 driver enters Nascar he does everything he can to beat Ricky. When the battle begins there are so many laughs you will not stop. Inappropriate for young teenagers but great for adults.,7,0,0,28 February 2020
