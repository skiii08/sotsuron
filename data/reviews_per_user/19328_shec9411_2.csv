United 93," We need to remember
","I didn't want to see this at first. Not because i thought that they were making blood money. I thought that i wasn't ready. So i picked up the DVD one weekend when i was. And i still wasn't.In high school, we were forced to watch Schindler's List to learn about the holocaust. We were never told a reason outside of that is was an important movie. In my view, this film is more worth of showing to high school students then any other film. Today, we have people making politics out of that day, on both sides of the isle. We have teachers giving children bias views of what has happened since. There is a split in our culture that was not prevalent in September 2001. Peopl need to be brought back to that point, realize that it isn't about politics or anything else. They need to remember. I needed to remember.Now, this might be the most painful experience in your life at a movie theater, but you will never regret it, for the rest of your days.",9,1,3,20 October 2007
Zodiac," Not your average masterpiece
","So why don't many people like this movie? Why will people you talk to say how boring this movie was? Simple, the art of the two and a half hour movie has been lost to either the too long (POTC 3, LOTR) or the too short, making you want more from the movie (for my money, Munich and several others). So we have been breast fed on hour and a half movies that anything over 100 minutes bores most people unless there is a large amount of violence or explosions. But, this movie is one of the best movies of the year despite any critics of it you know.This is a film that brings Hollywood back to Hitchcock. The script is more like a play, the dialog well written and the characters deep. The leading performances are strong, the strongest and most surprising being Mark Ruffalo. This is not the average fincher film, not fight club, not seven. Instead of packing everything with style and philosophy, fincher lets the story and the characters move the movie along. And, it stays in realism, rarely straying from the source material, making it ambiguous, not pointing fingers at any single suspect. Once you have it figured out, the main suspect changes. The film treats you like the Zodiac treated the investigators, teasing you, making you think that you knows who was the killer. It is a film that makes you think, and no one is used to that. And what makes this film suspenseful, tense, even creepy, isn't something within the film, it is the truth.",9,2,4,12 October 2007
