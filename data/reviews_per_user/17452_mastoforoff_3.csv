The Blair Witch Project," The only thing that scared me about this movie
","The only thing that scared me about this movie was the fact that i actually spent $5 and 2 hours of my life on a movie that really sucked large. On a scale of 1 to 10 i could not even give it a vote, cuz negative numbers would have to be my vote. Not scary, very boring. On a scale of garbage i would personally say this movie ranks high tho.",1,2,4,8 July 2003
MASH," To say that woody allen is a genius
","Is an insult to idiots, granted MASH is not as much of a masterpiece that it has been credited for, it is still better than any Woody Allen movie, some reviewer said that Woody Allen produced better movies than Robert Altman, umm not really unless you like really bad movies, at least Robert Altman can produce an intellectual story which is more than I can say about Woody Allen, possibly the worst writer in the history of film, even the 3 Stooges were more intelligent.",Null,1,12,24 February 2004
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Other than the animation....
","nothing good can be said about this movie, the music sucked, and although i am not a fan of musicals, this has to be the worst musical of all time. Music is supposed to add to a movie, not be the entire story, I mean i am sorry but 2 hours or however long this movie was of entirely crappy music is just tooo much. Tim Burton should stick to art direction, the only half decent film he ever made was Beetlejuice, and even that was barely decent. I give this movie a one (on a scale of ten).",Null,1,3,26 August 2003
