The Ring," See the Ring and die...of embarrassment, maybe.
","I had high hopes.  Naomi Watts, whom I loved in Mulholland Dr., and a wonderful premise about being doomed after viewing a video recording, had me hooked.Then I saw it.  A conventional slasher-style opening, but I was willing to forgive it for that.  And I will admit, when we do see the video, it is wonderfully cryptic and eerily surreal, and that's always a selling point for me.But right after that, it all goes downhill.  The characters get dumber, the jump-scenes louder, and the story line far too conventional.  The filmmakers answer all the wrong questions and ignore the right ones; they try to be cryptic, but still dumb it down for standard acceptance.  And the ending was about twenty minutes longer than it should have been, and a sad attempt to make this above the typical 'ghost' story.  They take a nice, eerie, atmospherical set up and turn it into a special effects 'here's what we haven't been showing you!' horror show, quite reminiscent of House on Haunted Hill (1999) or The Haunting (1999 as well).  And that blasted ring that keeps popping up is quite headache-inducing.I did like the idea of the video, I did like the video itself (very 'Lynchian' touch--a nod to Watts' last job, perhaps), but beyond that, it's typical Hollywood horror fare, which taxes the suspension of disbelief just a bit too much, and which, quite frankly, we're getting too much of.Most people I know said it was creepy.  But the rest, who have been exposed to a wider range of far-better films, concur: when you see the Ring, you will crave Tylenol.I've seen worse, but I've also seen a helluva lot better.",Null,0,0,27 October 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Ach, it's just a wee bonnie rabbit....
","For sheer originality on an ultra-low budget, nothing can quite match the chemistry, comedy, and utter lunacy of Monty Python, and it all seems to come together in this, their most quotable motion picture.But enough of that silliness.  This 1971 hit, which is to date the most recognisable of the Python's efforts, still holds strong.  But like so many other great controversial cult things, you either get it, or you don't.  And if you don't, you hate it.I'm a very literary minded guy, with a very literary attitude towards life. And the sheer surreallity of Monty Python is one of the most hilarious things I can find, the total unexpected twists from reality into the downright bizarre!  And what a blast at the classic Arthur legend, especially in the following line: 'Listen, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government!'  So much for fable!So, what does all this mean?  I'll tell you what it all means!NI!!!",Null,4,5,29 October 2002
