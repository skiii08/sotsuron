Frost_Nixon," In the tenth round,,,Nixon goes down....
","'Frost/Nixon' could be thought of as a heavy weight boxing match: A political version of Tyson's loss to Buster Douglas. Both Nixon and Frost enter the fight for personal reasons, Nixon attempts to repair his shattered post Watergate image, and Frost attempts to make a name for him self. While 'Frost/Nixon' is being sold as an intense political thriller, it's no more dramatic then the interviews it's based on. It recreates them with astonishing accuracy. That's not saying the movie isn't good. It's fascinating, but far from nail biting.'Frost/Nixon' is an actor's movie. Ron Howard places the camera on his two stars, Michael Sheen and Frank Langella and lets them go at it. Langella's performance is transcendent. Not knowing what Langella looks like helps the experience. At first his slouching posture and thick Nixon accent become distracting. After being absorbed into the movie I was convinced that he really was Nixon.Michael Sheen doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. He was great as Tony Blair, supporting Hellen Mirren to an Oscar victory. This time he's supported Langella to a best actor nomination. Maybe Sheen will be considered sooner or later. Sometimes it takes two or three snubs to finally get the Academy's approval.Neither Frost nor Nixon know what they're getting into. Frost doesn't expects Nixon's bullying tactics. Nixon throws him off only seconds before the interview shoots by commenting on his shoes and asking him personal questions about his sex life. Nixon doesn't expect Frost to fight back. At first Nixon is dominant until the final moments of the interview, where Frost grows a spine and drills Nixon with the tough questions everyone in the world wanted to ask Nixon.Ron Howard made this film based on a fantasy of what any one would want to do to Bush: ask him the tough questions he would never want to answer. While Bush may have been the worst president of our time, even he is smart enough not to fall into a trap set by a blood thirsty journalist. Did you see the last television appearances the 43rd president made? He lied as if he wasn't there. If Frost/Bush were made I would gladly see it, but as I said before, that's just a fantasy.",8,1,3,29 January 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," I need an amnesia bullet to forget this film...
","Great super hero films only come around as often as Hailey's Comet. That means last year was miraculous: two great super hero films in the same year. 2009 will not be so lucky. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' has come to fill the void between 'The Dark Knight' and the next great super hero picture.To put it simply: it gets it wrong, very, very wrong. It has a hero with no physical or emotional vulnerability. It has plenty of action with nothing at stake and violence with no consequence. And the very goal of this origin story is to build a character, and it can't even do that right.The story is about the beginnings of Wolverine. At first he's just a boy named James Howlett living in 19th century Canada with his brother Victor. James witnesses the murder of his father and kills the attacker, only to learn the attacker is his real father. James and Victor dash into the woods, and through the magic of editing we leap into the future, where James and Victor become Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber. They fight in nearly every major American war, they join the special weapon X program, and turn against one another when Victor murders the love of James's life. This leads James to be injected with adamantium, making him invincible, change his name to Wolverine, and seek revenge against his brother.And throughout all of this Hugh Jackman doesn't do much besides smirk, snarl, growl, say bub a few times and scream. He does a lot of screaming. There are long action sequences where Wolverine just stands around while other mutants do the fighting. Liev Schreiber attempts to inject some personality into his role but he's a lost cause in a film like this.About those other mutants, there are a lot of them. Most of them are unnecessarily jammed into the story to make the fans happy. There's agent Zero who doesn't seem to have any specific power, just a lot of them. There's the blob, an obese boxer who looks like a combination between fat bastard and Billy idol. Ryan Reynolds is dead pool, aka 'the merc with the mouth', who's one-liners provide the films only humor. We see him later on with his mouth sewn shut. And Cyclops shows up late in the film, just to show up.The most insulting of all is Gambit, my personal favorite X-Man. His only purpose is to take Wolverine from point A to point B in his air plane. Taylor Kirsch is terribly miscast, and extremely bland. His Cajun accent flickers on and off. His power is having a magical stick that provides an over kill of mediocre special effects.And despite an onslaught of special effects, none of them impress. It never seems as if this was a 100 million dollar film, even though the budget was 150 million dollars. I would have guessed 60 million. The effects lack the polish and level of detail you would expect from such a project. There's a scene where Wolverines claws are so poorly rendered they look hand drawn. There's a scene where an entire barn is engulfed in an explosion and Wolverine emerges from it without a single singe of his hair or clothes, while riding on top of a gasoline powered motorcycle that isn't so much as scratched. There are major editing mistakes to go along with the effects. There is a scene where Wolverine walks far away from a building only to reappear in it a split second later.To be fair I've seen worse. This inst a terrible film, but its bad in the sense that I can't say any thing positive about it. There is no point in watching it. It takes two hours just to tell you something you already know, and to tell you things you would never want to know, like the cause of Wolverines amnesia. It's just a complete waste of time and money, the time and money it took to make it and the time and money it takes to watch it.This film was directed by the formerly independent Gavin Hood, who's film 'Tsotsi' won an Oscar for best foreign language film. This film was a modest hit so don't expect Tsotsi 2 any time soon.",5,1,4,11 June 2009
Terminator Salvation," It took six years to make this film...just think about that.
","Another movie lover named Confused Matthew (you may have heard of him) said something totally on point about 'POTC 3: At Worlds End'. He said that there was no excuse for the film makers to make such a bad sequel when they had all the time, the star power, and the resources to make it good. The same can be said for Terminator: Salvation, an unholy mess of a sequel that begs for James Cameron's help throughout every unwritten, audience insulting minute of it's run time.Like At Worlds End, the producers, director McG and his screen writers had plenty of time, money and star power to make a tolerable film. But the difference is, they had even more money and more time (six years to be exact). That's enough time to write an entire library of scripts, and it's apparent that they struggled to scribble just one. I imagine it was written with crayons on a napkin moments before being submitted.The plot is so absent you might as well be watching a documentary on how the film was made, that might be more entertaining. A guy gets executed in 2003, and wakes up in the apocalyptic future, where humanity battles evil robots. He wanders around wondering what the heck is going on, runs into a few resistance fighters, and then John Connor. There is the plot. I couldn't even write a spoiler if I wanted to.The guy that walks around a lot has a big secret that some evil executive decided to put in the trailer. I guess he forgot that the whole movie is built around the twist. The lesson here future film makers is that you never build a movie around a secret.After making it pretty clear that there is no plot, the last few minutes are spent trying to make up a plot at the last minute. Like I said before, SIX YEARS TO WRITE ONE. Being a long, plot less, unwritten movie is one thing, but treating the audience like they're stupid is another. This movie earns a spot in action movie hell.The saving grace is the production values, the CGI robot effects, and one awesome chase scene. If only these things were in a better movie. If only the wasted 200 million dollar budget bought something useful instead of this film, like unemployment checks. Maybe a few of them should go to the producers of this disaster because they're going to need it soon.",Null,1,3,20 July 2009
The Dark Knight," An unforgettable epic...The Godfather of comic book movies.
","Seeing 'The Dark Knight' for the first time took me back to my childhood. That magical time when you could get excited about something. Imagine this: 8:00 PM on July 18th 2008, a theater full of people, full to the point where some people sat on the floor. The curtain falls. The Batman logo appears on screen and the room goes silent for almost an entire two and a half hours, except for a few laughs and gasps. It ends with the loudest applause ever heard in a theater with a hundred people. That's the power an epic has. What is an epic? It's a movie that sets out to be the greatest of all time and comes close. 'The Dark Knight' comes dangerously close. At the end of 'Batman Begins' Commissioner Gordon warns Batman about his impact on crime. The harder he fights crime the harder the criminals will fight him. 'The Dark Knight' takes this idea to the next level. Enter the Joker, a run of the mill thug who steals millions from Gotham's top criminals, insults them, and then offers his services to exterminate Batman. The Joker manipulates the fears of Gotham city and publicly asks The Batman to reveal his identity to prevent the Joker from killing innocent people. This makes Bruce Wayne question if has the inner strength to face a villain as sadistic as the Joker. Alfred tells him that Batman because Batman is incorruptible he must make the choices no one else can. He has to be the one to stand up to the Joker. But Bruce Wayne is not as strong. Many times he contemplates giving up on his quest. This Bruce Wayne is the most layered and interesting of all the Bruce Wayne's.Gotham has a new district attorney: Harvey Dent. He's a hero that the people need. A man working within the law. A man not hidden beneath a mask. He's the opposite, always out in the open no matter what criminal threatens him. Dent, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman team up to put crime away for good. The Joker challenges them and forces each of them to make hard choices that will have a devastating impact on their lives no matter what they choose to do.That's what the Dark Knight is about. Heroism. What it truly means to be a hero and the consequences it brings. The hard choices that normal people can not make, and the results those choices bring. Dent, Gordon and Batman each face consequences for their courageous actions, some more severe then others. By the end of the film they're never the same.Harvey Dent has the same convictions as Batman but he's not a strong. Through tragic circumstances the Joker twists his mind and turns him into a villain in the second half of the film. He becomes the key component in the Jokers master plan to create chaos. The people look up to Dent for protection and seeing him turn to the dark side would frighten the citizens to the point of madness. The Joker is truly the devil. He finds weakness and human error and morphs it into evil. There has rarely been a villain this frightening.The cast is an ensemble. And with the talents of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman why not? Everyone gets a chance to shine, including Maggie Gyllenhaal a beautiful and supremely gifted actress. Her portrayal of Rachel Dawes makes Katie Holmes's last credible role nearly obsolete. No actor in this movie ,or any movie, is better than Heath Ledger. Thanks to the cosmetic team he is unrecognizable, an Oscar nod could be coming for them. He speaks with an thick Chicago accent and never breaks it. He walks with a strange limp. He sucks on his cheeks because his face has been sliced open. His performance is a total performance: mind, body and soul. He was the Joker, and his portrayal will be the definitive version of the character, sorry Jack. If he doesn't win best supporting actor the Academy should stop giving the award. God bless the actor brave enough to fill his shoes an a sequel.'The Dark Knight' is easily the greatest comic book/super hero movie ever made. This is all because of the fearless direction of Christopher Nolan. There is no boundary he wont cross, and no idea he isn't willing to explore. He takes Batman from the confined realm of comic books and brings him into reality. Gotham city exists and it exists within us. We are the people of Gotham, so frightened with threats, through fear so easily corruptible. Christopher Nolan lets us see our own human emotions at their very lowest, and fully explains why we need heroes, because heroes give us hope and take our fears away. Hope is the movies key plot device and its an emotion worth fighting for.'The Dark Knight' comes close to being one of the greatest movies ever made. I can only hope the stiffs at the Academy recognize its brilliance. A comic book movie has never been this close to getting in the best picture race, and that's because none of them have been this good. The Joker tells Batman that they've changed Gotham City forever and they can never go back. The Dark Knight has changed comic book movies forever, and I can only hope we never go back to the way it wasin 1997.",10,2,6,9 January 2009
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Infinite awfulness, minimal charm
","There's a touching scene early in this film where Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) have just met and kissed for the first time. They sit in Nicks car and exchange glances that tell us love has just blossomed. This happens 15 minutes into the film and I felt that it should have just ended right there.I'm not saying this is a terrible movie, but it's a waste of time. You go into any romantic comedy expecting the leading man and woman to fall in love by the end, but in this film they fall in love very early, yet they don't ride off into the sunset right away. That's because the plot keeps putting them together, then breaking them up, and then putting them back together again until the credits finally roll.Nick is grieving over being cheated on and dumped by his ex girl friend Tris, who for unclear reasons is friends with Norah, who she constantly insults only to boost her own insecurity. Norah gets even by making out with Nick, unaware that he's Tris's ex boy friend. This kick stars the romantic plot which is on auto pilot from the start.While running around New York City Norah runs into her ex boy friend Tal, who dated her because her father is a powerful music producer. Why anyone would like Tal is a mystery. He's the clichéd jerk character who only exists to be hated.Will Nick and Norah fall in love, or will they retreat back to their cruel and unlikable exes? When you know how its going to end there isn't much reason to care.The script struggles to develop a strong sub plot go along with the mediocre romance. One attempt at one is the search for Norah's friend Caroline, who gets sloppy drunk and stumbles all around New York city without getting mugged or sexually assaulted. How she manages to do that could be it's own movie.The other sub plot is the search for a secret concert for a band called 'Where's Fluffy'. A secret concert is probably the worst idea in the history of music. The only way to reach the location of the concert is to find instructions scribbled on a bathroom stall. If a miraculous Beatles reunion was being held at a secret location I doubt anyone would make it.The gorgeous actress Kat Dennings and Micheal Cera build minimal chemistry, but it's tiring to see these two easily playing to the usual types they always play: Cera is the sensitive, likable guy, and Dennings is the slightly bitchy sarcastic smart girl. It works for them now but they should learn that nothing great has ever been achieved by playing it safe. I also hated how their characters bond over their connection to music, which they talk about in nearly every scene, but you never get to hear it. It's like porn without seeing sex.Maybe this experience is funny you may be asking? Well the big recurring joke involves piece of gum that travels from mouth to mouth, gets covered in mucus, falls down into a vomit filled toilet, and finds its way back into various peoples mouths. Hilarious right?",Null,0,0,28 July 2009
The Wrestler," A movie thats powerful, deep, and realistic...and its about something fake...
","It's no secret that professional wrestling is fake, but that's only to a certain extent. It's staged, which means the events in the ring are plotted out in advance. Chairs are smashed across faces, three hundred pound men leap from twenty feet in the air, weapons come from under the mat, and the wrestlers involved never take any permanent damage. Despite the obvious truth about the sport you would never tell a pro wrestler what he does is fake. That's because sport is played by real people who put their lives on the line for their sport. 'The Wrestler' is all about stripping the illusion away from the sport and showing us a wrestler named Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a wrestler ten years past his prime. Randy attempts to keep his glory days of the 80's alive, even at the risk of his own life. Thanks to the script by Robert D. Seigel, the direction of Darren Aronofsky, and the incredible performance of Mickey Rourke, the wrestler becomes so realistic it could be mistaken for a documentary.Inside the ring Randy is well respected and admired. The younger wrestlers look up to him, seek his advice and encouragement. Outside the ring reality bites: Randy lives in a trailer park and works at a small grocery store to support him. In once scene is rent is late and he is forced to sleep in his trailer. What led him to that point isn't clearly explained but you can figure it out. A many years of self destructive behavior have left his body damaged, along with most of his relationships. We seem him buying steroids before a match. in another scene he abuses cocaine. This leads to a near fatal heart attack that takes him out of wrestling for good.While out of the game he tries to mend broken fences. He has a daughter he's doesn't know very well. She's grown up to be a lesbian. He does his best to slowly work his way back into her life. His love interest is an aging stripper played by Marissa Tomei. She's also past her prime. She roams the strip club offering lap dances and getting denied numerous times. Who in their right mind would turn down Marissa Tomei? The wrestling scenes are fare more entertaining and insightful then anything in the WWE. Randy hides a razor blade in his pads just so he can make himself bleed at the appropriate moment. There's a brutal match involving glass, nails, barbed wire and a staple gun. Randy and the Necro Butcher (a real life wrestler) puncture each other's skin with a staple gun, and the staples are real. After the match the paramedics pull the staples out.Without the performance of Mickey Rourke 'The Wrestler' would not be as authentic as it is. Prior to his role in this film, Rourke had become a joke, a parody of himself. A former pretty boy actor who destroyed his face during his short lived boxing career (I guess he wasn't very good) and tried to fix it with plastic surgery. It was not a very good combination, and it becomes painfully clear in this movie. But the magic forces of life gave the fallen actor a break when Aronofsky told the producers that he didn't want Nicholas Cage, he wanted Mickey. I can't credit him enough for kicking Cage to the curb: A fine actor but not right for the part. Mickey was born to play Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. He became Randy so convincingly because he is Randy. His performance is dripping with so much authenticity it's hard to tell where Mickey begins and Randy ends. It's the comeback of a lifetime.The Academy nominated him for best actor, an award he deserves to win. He will win it. While he faces tough competition the other four actors are just playing dress up compared to the performance Mickey displays. Nothing about it feels forced, or fake. You believe he's the character from the first shot and all the way into the last. Marissa Tomei was also nominated for best supporting actress. She also deserved the nod, but not the victory. Why didn't Aronofksy, or Seigel get nominated? Without the realistic writing, and focused direction those two performances would never be. And 'The Wrestler' as a whole is easily the best movie of 2008. You can't convince everybody, especially the stiffs at the Academy. How ironic that two excellent movies about men in outrageous costumes got snubbed this yearÂ….I think you know what the other movie is.",10,1,2,30 January 2009
