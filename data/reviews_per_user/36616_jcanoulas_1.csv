First Man," Slow, controversial and really bad music.
","Would not recommend it, cannot see the reason to watch it when we already know the whole story and it is just a biography.
We did not learn much about Neil and did not see any movie flow to keep us interested.
All ups and downs, in the story the scenes and the music.
Worst music ever and so unfitting that you loose the sensation of the scene.
