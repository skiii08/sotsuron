The Blair Witch Project," A breakthrough in the horror film genre
","Meanwhile a lot of kids from the new generation haven't even watched this awesome movie I really think that they should.
The Blair switch Project is a movie that started a whole new sub genre in horror movies.
The whole marketing was amazingly designed. I am 35 and I can still remember the panic of not knowing if it was a real documentary or a very well crafted fiction.
So if you where born in the 2000's and haven't seen these movie I would totally say it is a MOST!",10,1,4,30 June 2019
