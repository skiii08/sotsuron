Iron Man 3," Where is Iron Man?
","I really looked forward to seeing how Iron Man would deal with his next enemy...with all his fine art battling skills, his always one step ahead science and most of all...being very smart and unbeatable...just like in The Avengers.After seeing Iron Man 3 I was left with an awkward question: Now where was Iron Man?Spoiler Alert below! --------------------Thruout the movie Tony Stark is busy finding out who his enemy is and doesn't need Iron Man for that...only to find out in the end that, when finally in action, he cannot beat his enemy himself.I was expecting Iron Man...IRON MAN..That bright smart scientist, that unbeatable super action hero you don't want to mess around with...just like in The Avengers...and then even some more!Well...let's hope Iron Man will return in full glory in The Avengers 2.By the way, Robert Downey Jr. is still perfect as Iron Man! Compliments to him. The poor script is the issue.",4,2,4,31 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Well...I didn't actually see it
","SPOILER ALERT!Well, I read that Han Solo dies. Well, in a true Star Wars movie, Han Solo CANNOT die, neither can Princess Lea and Luke Skywalker...they simply are the unbeatable icons of the original series, the heroes we all came to love and like so much. Such icons simply cannot die. If you make a sequel and you let a character like Han Solo die then, honestly, you don't really understand the Star Wars world.I read how Han dies and by who...his own son. What an awful and disgusting piece of storytelling. As a Star Wars fan I could have done way better: Introduce Han's son as a lovable repeat of Han himself...with renewed youth, humor and weirdness. For god sake, they could have named him Ben, to see Obi Wan revived as well...and Han and Lea could enjoy all the exciting adventures in upcoming sequels to come for their son, enjoying their retirement themselves in the next movie.But no, they let Han die...by his own son...SHAME ON YOU!I guess you need to be part of a certain generation aged over 35 at least(!) to fully grasp the Star Wars effect.That said, I can't really blame the team behind this movie: Mr. Lucas was and still is not able to repeat the magic either...the originals were created out of pure will to create...and Mr. Lucas just happened to be part of that process.Just let the original movies be in peace and move on to something new.I don't need to see this movie and I won't watch it in the future.Let me watch 'The Empire Strikes Back' once more...for a glorious victory and amazing ending...with Han and all the others! Yiiiihaaa!",1,9,23,1 January 2016
