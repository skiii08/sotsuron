Requiem for a Dream," Awful Awful Awful...and way overrated
","Do not waste your time on this pointless film. Do not be fooled by all of the favorable reviews. There are too many flaws to mention. While some of the camera work and techniques were interesting, anything positive was lost due to an entirely predictable and weak plot. The character development was non existent. How this film is confused by some as being 'deep' or innovative is beyond me. It is also beyond me to explain why I am writing this review for a movie I so deeply despised. I guess I want others to be warned that this film is not nearly worthy of the high ratings it has received. Spare yourself the agony. Just say no!",1,5,11,5 August 2007
