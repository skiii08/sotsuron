Sucker Punch," Getting punched by Sucker Punched
","Sucker punch was a great movie, the way it showed how they anything can seem real if you really believe it. How everything she went through was real yet fake. How all of her friends plaid was there with her yet was not her friends. How people cared about her didn't care about her, Yet they did. To understand somethings in this review you would have to watch the movie. It was one of the best movies that year, I just loved how when she danced she kicked but, and when she kicked butt she danced. I also liked how all of dreams with in a dream had something to do with what was happening in the first dream. Like when one girl died in her first dream it plaid through in her dream with in a dream. It was cool movie, and nice to watch for people who like action. So what i'm trying to say this about this movie is when you go to see sucker punched, get ready to be...Sucker Puncked (From all the action)",7,2,4,12 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Come on part two
","Braking Dawn was one of the best movies of this year. I read the book and was scared that the movie was not going to do the book any justice yet I was wrong. I am very proud of the outcome of the movie and can not wait until part two come out. The movie was great and I just can not wait for the second part to come out. I don't think it will be as popular yet I think it's going to get a lot of praise like Harry Potter. And from reading the book, Bella, Edward, Jacob, and everyone is going to have a lode on their hands. Espacly at the end. Good thing that baby has a lot of people looking out for it. She's going to need it.",7,0,8,10 December 2011
X-Men: First Class," X-men a comic lovers excitement
","X-men first class was most like the rest of them, good! If you like your comics and you like X-men, you would be a fool to not wont to see this movie. It shows how the x-men became the e-men, why perfecer x is in a weal chair, how prefecor x get his name, and how they found the other x-men. And you just don't have to like comics to like this movie. e-men is for all types of people, with different styles, and different ages. The only thing that dose not send the e-men movies through the roof is the order. It's a little hurtful for you to see everything that's happened in first movies, and at the end of last stand they give you hope that fight is not over and that something els is going to happen yet they just cut it off, and then they come out with a movie that says how it all began. Yeah we wont to know how it all began yet that's long over due. Know we wont to know how it ended, it's not like they said something like and the e-men went on to fight great crimes that was just to big for man kind to fight, or something like that. man they could have even did like fifteen to twenty years latter perfecer x died leaving the school in the hands of storm and wolverine yet they didn't. They just cut it off. But happy for them they saved it with First Class. it's like you haven't really seen the x-men movie until you've see that one. Or you can't really be a fan unless you saw that. Or you don't really know how the story started until you've seen first class. So no matter how many times you went back to see all the other movies. you don't know that whole story until you've seen... X-MEN:FIRST CLASS(Sorry I am not the best speller)",8,0,1,10 December 2011
