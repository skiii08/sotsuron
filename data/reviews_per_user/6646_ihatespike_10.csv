Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," An engaging game
","The original cast and director (and a few newcomers) have banded together to bring us yet another visually delightful, humorous and action-packed sequel to Sherlock Holmes' newest incarnation.A game of shadows takes place shortly after the events of the first film as Holmes interferes with Prof. Moriarty's plans one time too many and the two agree that it is indeed war between them, or if you prefer, the beginning movements in a good vs. evil game of chess.Many of the same elements remain in the series, from Holmes' energetically manic and inconsiderate behavior to the slow-motion action sequences which are used a bit more, and artistically tinkered with. This is both a critique and a compliment, because it can be rather jarring and repetitive, but also very stylish and fun. I would highly recommend you choose a seat that is a decent distance from the screen so that these elements can be properly enjoyed without being a distraction. Admittedly, the second half of the film is where things really start to speed along nicely, but in most ways the moderate and somewhat bleak start is justified by the film's conclusion. I haven't watched many of the older Holmes films but I have read all the stories and I can say that it is a wonderful and satisfying retelling of the battle between Doyle's fictional geniuses. Yet again the sets and locations are appropriate and well made, the humor is goofy and offbeat (a bit more risqu√© than the last, but not enough to really offend I don't think), the cast shines in their roles, including the talented Jared Harris, who forgoes overplaying the role of antagonist in favor of a soft-spoken and covertly cruel narcissist, Noomie Rapace as the gypsy Sim does not torture us with stereotypically maudlin, lascivious or catty dialogue, and instead is a sturdy and calming presence added to the brotherly bond of Holmes and Watson, and Stephen Fry plays Sherlock's older brother Mycroft exactly as I pictured him; lazy, smart and endearingly snobbish.The only real complaint I have with this film (and this is where the spoilers are, beware!) Is the supposed death of Irene Adler, which falls short of being a twist since it takes place at the beginning of the film, and is neither helpful in securing our dislike of Moriarty (since we do not see Irene's dead body or even prolonged suffering), nor our empathy for Sherlock (since he literally makes no comment or reaction to hearing of her death). The entire thing is less convincing than Blackwood's death at the beginning of the first film, pointless for the aforementioned fact that it was dealt with in a totally underwhelming way, and undermining of Irene's character in intelligence and the fact that she repeatedly escaped brushes with death in the first film. This write-off is disappointing not only because Adler was a useful and likable character, but also because if it was intended to be absolute then that means that the writers were sloppy and indifferent in that respect.All this being said, I did enjoy the film, and perhaps if you take my recommendation, you will too.",8,0,5,20 December 2011
The Hunger Games," A timid but firm first step towards a powerful trilogy.
","I am already a fan, but I will try to make this review as fair and as clear as possible.The Hunger Games is about a great deal of things, but on the surface is this: survival. Those who enjoy dystopian stories may find the Hunger Games to be similar, and yet the style and voice are fresh enough to appeal to the youth. So where does this film fit in? Somewhere in the middle; you don't have label yourself a critic or a fan or a casual viewer to enjoy this movie-it stands on its own.Our protagonist is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). She is neither acidic nor saccharine in behavior; she is simply naturally reserved, and perhaps a little sullen (with good reason). Her character is well-played and strikes to the core as realistic; for that alone the audience is able to cheer for her. If she's is genuine, so too are her dire circumstances, and so too is the weight of her success. The supporting (and talented) cast fall into place comfortably; not once did I cringe at an ill-spoken line or a poorly-cast character. Certainly there were changes made from book-to-movie, most if not all were to aid the audience's comprehension, as we no longer have Katniss' first-person narration to explain plot points to us. The art direction was in most areas commendable, and in others simply adequate, the music score was unique and subtly haunting, and the camera work to be honest flipped between lousy and decent. I recommend you sit a fair deal away from the screen since most of the intro scenes are choppy. I assume this was done to hurry things along and add to tension but I felt that swift, steady shots would have sufficed. The violence in this movie is sensitized at just the right level (which is refreshing, since most film-violence is usually melodramatic or mindless), and is a unique blend of toned-down bloodshed with an intense feeling of moral disgust. As for my complaints, there is the aforementioned shaky-camera in some scenes, the too-rushed character interaction/development (at least on behalf of characters who won't return for the sequels), the omission of a few bits of back-story and artistic design that I felt would have enriched the story more for those who haven't read the books (and a few times their omission made the film seem a little too edited), and there were a handful of scenes that could have used dramatic embellishment and yet went without.All in all I give it an 8 out of 10; it stands the test of translating from one form of media to another, it gives us a taste of both the love and the humanity within such bleak settings, and it wets our appetite for the chaos to come. Let the games begin.",8,3,15,24 March 2012
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," This is a warning; I'm already a fan.
","Yup I saw it opening day. If you're not already into Hellboy and just want someone to summarize this then here goes; you know those movies of the fantasy genre that could be really awesome but end up falling flat? This movie and the one before it got the formula right. It's got that goofy humor in it but it isn't unbearable or out of character, it has more action than the last but it doesn't bog down the story and it doesn't make you dizzy, in fact the choreography is beautiful without being obsessed with style (a fine line in my opinion) and it really does take you to that realm of Guillermo/Mignola creativity that I love. The CGI doesn't jump into your face and scream 'I'm FAKE' in fact the thought never crossed my mind (bravo CG team). I also feel the need to mention that you care about the characters. Maybe it's just me but I'm seeing less and less of that in film these days; I think movie makers are starting to assume their audiences will just side with the protagonist because they said so but the empathy felt towards the inhuman characters especially (even the less important ones) is appreciated. I'm excited to see where this series takes us next. In the mean time I hope you take my recommendation and enjoy yourself.",10,3,8,12 July 2008
Now You See Me," A very fun, slightly flawed movie
","First of all, let me say that this film does not break your trust by tossing out some deus ex machina explanation at the end or plot-twist you so hard your head falls off. The threads of story, while somewhat outlandish, are well-woven and resolved almost totally satisfactorily. That's basically my fancy way of saying I didn't guess the ending, it did make sense, and the journey there was fun.I wouldn't say that this is a highly intellectual movie with layers and layers of philosophical questions to ponder over after it's over, but it isn't stupid either. You're not bored by over-complexity or insulted by the inanely simple. I appreciate that balance.The cast is solid but the characters could (and should have) been explored more without any worry over the plot getting spoiled. Because of this missed opportunity you may question the overall motivation of the antiheroes, especially since your first impression of the four magicians is that they are selfish and have no grandiose plans for their lives. This doesn't mean they aren't easy to like, but I feel it does clash with the story later on.The visuals/camarawork are nice (although occasionally too spinney and maybe just a little too glossy), the humor and the romance are felt and enjoyed- no baggage, no complication, no melodrama, and the magic is explained. In real life, we know that commercial slight of hand needs to be left unexplained otherwise it loses its worth, but the makers of this movie know that film must tie the loose ends because the satisfaction is the conclusion, NOT the mystery in and of itself.That being said, I will admit the overall conclusion was left just a tiny bit blurry, which may be due to the hope for a sequel. I'd honestly be okay with that as I feel this film earned it. Moviegoers may begrudge it that open-ended feeling though, if they felt that the explanation was not a justifiable payoff. My advice is to go see it, have fun, and let your belief be suspended. At worst the hypnotism will leave you disoriented and grumpy, at best you'll have a blast and come back down as soft as a feather.",Null,1,3,31 May 2013
Batman Begins," Goodbye Burton and Schumacher, Hellooo Nolan and Goyer!
","I'm not one for going into an in-depth critique on something, so my review will try to appeal to those looking for a quick review, This movie was quite amazing, I'll admit some of the fight scenes were a little too up close so you really couldn't see much, but that was forgivable, the writer and director did a great job of grounding this movie into reality, the cast was superb, the actors all are talented without being MTV hyped such as Halle Berry in last summer's flop Catwoman. I say this in all honesty having viewed every other actor playing both Batman and Bruce Wayne: Christian Bale is by far the most intimidating as batman while balancing the role as the charmingly shallow facade of the Bruce Wayne of the public. I recommend it to anyone, fan or not, and hope you enjoy it if you take my advice.",10,1,1,17 June 2005
Hellboy," The movie that pulled off cool when only campy was expected
","I have to tell you, this movie blew my mind. think about it, paranormal bureau? big red dude with huge gun? Rasputin? nazis? this movie had cheesy written all over it. But get this; it wasn't. in case you don't know, Hellboy is a comic book too. Here I was expecting another Van Helsing or League of extraordinarily boring gentleman, I had a pleasant surprise. this movie pulled off a big red dude fighting the forces of evil without drowning it in CGI, and instead of focusing on pure action (which is good but gets boring pretty fast) it also gave time for you to get to know the human side of all the characters. (even the inhuman ones) and this movie has succeeded where so many others have failed by combining action romance and adventure, instead of just one. that is ever so important. especially for a movie like this. none of the characters were over or underplayed despite their seemingly ridiculous and impossible to take serious roles. how odd that such a small name superhero would be so much more similar to the comic than the popular ones. trust me, if you like comics, you'll LOVE this movie, heck, even if you aren't into comics, you'll still like it!",10,0,0,23 July 2004
The Dark Knight," A-maz-ing
","I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!",10,24,50,18 July 2008
Hancock," Flawed Hero? Try unlikable walking-disaster.
","I'd like to think that Hollywood's greed is tempered with genuine talent a fair deal of the time, as well as some messages that people were passionate about enough to present to us cinematically.And then there are movies like Hancock, wherein there is no message worth telling, and all the talent involved is beaten into submission by an oppressively useless script and the greedy leeches who produced it.Hancock is about a guy with superpowers (Will Smith) who essentially walks around looking like he's got a mouthful of rat poison and sour patch kids, being so inept at helping people that it feels like a Jerry Lewis movie if Jerry Lewis had superpowers and was utterly unlikable and unsympathetic. Jason Bateman plays Jason Bateman, a man who becomes Hancock's agent of sorts after Hancock manages to save his life in the most destructive way possible (because apparently seeing terroristic levels of destruction perpetrated almost nonstop by Mr. Sourface is uproarious). We also see Charlize Theron as she stands there having no chemistry with her fianc√É¬© (Bateman), and even less with Hancock, who she has a past with (and by past I mean a few incoherent sentences of wooden dialogue tossed out with no explanation). Long story short: Hancock manages to reign in his awfulness somewhat with the help of Bateman and his 2-dimensional nice-guy personality. Eddie Marsan stains his otherwise likable filmography by playing a bad guy who is bad (wow, what depth) in this sorry excuse for a film, tasteless attempts at humor are made in the form of bully children being tossed hundreds of feet in the air, a bad guy's hand getting chopped off with a metal disk, buildings getting smashed in half (by the 'good' guys, no less) and countless other wastes of cgi destruction that happen under the pretense of humor.Nothing was proved. Nobody cared.",1,9,16,21 December 2011
Sherlock Holmes," An enveloping movie (don't let the trailer turn you off)
","With films such as this I feel stuck in the middle of targeted audiences; I love it when a series gets restarted but I'm always on my guard and at my most cynical.If you've ever had the hours of your life stolen from you with films like Wild wild west or The League of extraordinary gentlemen, then you know exactly what I mean when I say that it is rare indeed to see a movie set in the 1800's that isn't a load of historically inaccurate, technologically ridiculous, propriety insulting garbage.Sherlock Holmes (much to my great relief) has forgone that pitfall by a giant leap; the technology in the movie fits the time period very well- we are allowed the pleasure of seeing 'the future' of that time, but nothing absurd like a giant mechanical spider or a machine gun crossbow. The settings are wonderful. I'm not a British historian, but I know quality sets when I see them, and for once it's not Tim Burton that's responsible (meaning that they're good Gothic settings, but not unnecessarily bleak.)The fact that Robert Downey Jr. stars as Holmes made me even more on edge; he's just isn't who would come to mind at all. But the humor and intelligence he brings to the role is refreshing and wholly natural. We're not subjected to the unbearable smugness of your average super-protagonist, but rather an almost childishly humorous grown man, weary but curious of the world around him. Downey's English accent flows comfortably, so well in fact that I would risk getting a beat-down from his bodyguards to hug him for not putting me through another Nicholas Cage type accent abomination. I was never really in to Jude Law or Rachel McAdams but both of them also fell into their characters with winning performances, Law being the sidekick that keeps the hero in line without being annoyingly mean, and McAdams the love interest/femme fetale without being over the top, clingy or trashy.The story itself will wind your brain around a bit until the end, but isn't that why people have been in love with Sherlock Holmes for so many years in the first place? It will not bore you for a second, and it wraps up very nicely at the end (although you'll probably want to go over it your head again after you've left, which is a good thing)And last but not least, anyone who's ever read Sherlock Holmes will notice a plethora of accuracy, hints and homages, from Watson's limp thanks to the Jezail bullet that passed through his leg in the Afghan war, to the photo of Irene Adler that Holmes kept as a reminder of the only woman who ever outsmarted him.So take my advice and don't miss out on something this rare in concept; a quality revamp that pushes boundaries instead of ignoring them.",10,5,9,2 January 2010
Casino Royale," *in shock*
","To start off let me say I was not a fan. James Bond has always been an interesting watch when I'm bored but I never liked the character; I thought he was a pompous womanizer and the corny lines and gadgets annoyed me greatly. Bravo to the restarting of this series and I really mean it; this kind of movie helps you get to care about the character in a whole new way. No he's no saint but at the same time I'm finally allowed the courtesy of caring about James Bond instead of the usual Hollywood assumption that I will care just because he's on the front cover and is clearly the protagonist. The first good sign is that I don't recall seeing a single dancing woman in the credits...instead we see the Bond figure and playing cards. I don't know about anyone else but the half naked women in the previous crediting irked me and I'm not even a feminist so my hat's off for breaking that repulsively juvenile tradition. There is a love interest but here's the kicker; I was interested! No quick introduction only to be bedded and double-crossed before the credits, in fact the entire movie I was waiting in growing fear that this so-far good film would be dashed to pieces by the usual cheap plot twists and such; I don't want to spoil anything but it wasn't what I'd seen before and it didn't leave me feeling cheated but rather set things up for the next movie which I'm sorry to say I've been ignoring until now under the assumption it was...well the jaded English snob I'd come to hate. The sexuality was tasteful and modest, the acting was very compelling, the story shocked my shoes off for the simple fact that it finally got an ounce of self-respect which is all I ask of any action movie (or any movie for that matter but action flicks seem to struggle with this one the most), there were corny lines but they were executed with a wry sense of humor as if to say 'we're only being goofy, who would actually talk like this? *nudge nudge*' and although I'm already a fan of Daniel Craig I'm very happy to see his work in this didn't disgust me (take for example Jason Statham playing in garbage like crank and Clive Owen in shoot em up) And there you have it; before I was someone who would watch Bond films only in an environment of open ridicule and boredom and suddenly I'm intrigued....I guess now I can call myself a fan.",10,3,9,17 August 2008
