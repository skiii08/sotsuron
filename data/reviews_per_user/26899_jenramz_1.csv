Walk the Line," Thank you, Joaquin and Reese
","The performances, the story, the passion are all consuming. The movie is awe inspiring. Joaquin and Reese have given the performances of their lives. I can't get enough of the movie! Johnny and June Cash's love affair was so powerful and captured brilliantly. Joaquin was meant to play Cash! The fact that he had met him before knowing about the movie proves you never know what you are being prepared for. Every thing was excellent about this movie-the acting, music, editing, hair and make-up...Only one problem-What do you do for an encore?!The Golden Globes recognized the movie, Reese and Joaquin with top honors. The Acadamy Award should also have gone to Joaquin.",10,4,7,21 March 2006
