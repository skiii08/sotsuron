Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Competes with Jerry Springer
","This movie is supposed to be a comedy about a backward, naive Kazak 'journalist' crossing America to make a documentary. In reality, it is about someone simply being very rude to others and laughing about it - kind of like when we were in junior high.I guess it is human nature for people to enjoy being spectators of other people getting humiliated. I suppose that is why folks enjoy the Jerry Springer show. At least on Jackass, people do it to themselves. Such entertainment differs from throwing folks to the lions in the Roman Coliseum only in intensity, not in concept. Based on the half of the movie I wasted time watching, I give it a 1 out of 10.",1,6,14,24 March 2007
The Italian Job," Now that was fun
","Some days it's fun not to be saddled with having to think too hard.  This movie offered no philosophy, no morality, no deep message (and unbelievably, no chemistry whatsoever between Stella and Charlie) but . . . I did have a flat out 104 minutes of fun.  Pretty clever indeed.  A clone of Ocean's Eleven in too many ways to mention.  There were some middle school teen boys in the crowded theater who apparently never saw a caper movie.  At first they annoyed me, but it ended up being almost as much fun watching them enjoy themselves as watching the movie.  I give it 9 out of 10.  (P.S. My eyes might have deceived me, but I'm almost sure I saw Spider Man in the crowd dashing to get out of the way of those Minis.)",9,0,1,31 May 2003
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A Slice of (Dark) Lives Movie
","This movie tells the story of the interaction of the two men, Jesse James and Robert Ford. It is very well crafted - the settings seemed quite authentic; the music was different, creative, mood-setting and intriguing; the acting was awesome; and the characters were fully developed.But ... the 'character development' revealed low quality people with low quality values who paid the price for their lack of, I guess, 'development of character'. I didn't care about them. I didn't admire them. I wasn't interested in them. And I saw nothing in them to emulate.So for skill in movie-making I give it a 10, minus 5 for the emptiness of the characters - net rating of 5.",5,0,4,20 October 2007
Across the Universe," Movie was to the 60's what Grease was to the 50's
","Just saw this movie and I must say - that was fun! The story is pretty universal - a guy and a girl from two different cultures fall for each other and their differences strain at their relationship, but eventually love conquers. The story has been told a lot of times - this one was set in the hippie period. But the centerpiece of this movie is the music.One thing a great musical requires is great music - and how can you get better than Beatles music? Listening to all those extremely familiar songs, I still marvel at the changes in chords and the way the music unfolds - awesome - makes me want to cry. Music really gets a person where they live - it exalts the human spirit and adds poetry to everyday experience - great music does it in a great way - Beatles music is great music.So with the awesome music, the movie has a great head start. Beyond this it is pretty well done - capturing the culture, politics, fashion and icons of the time. (We were pretty sure we saw Joe Cocker in this movie and IMBDb confirms it.) I noticed the director was born the same year I was - knowing Beatles songs inside out and having lived this era caused the movie to mean a lot to me. In addition, the movie had that aspect that you can't just put your finger on - it just moved me.I know I'm biased, but I believe the years 1965 to 1973 or so were the best ever for music. Every generation rebels against their parents' culture and that usually includes the music. But there is something different about the music of this period. I have noticed that my children's generation and all the subsequent generations to the '60's' rebelled against my generation - but the music is an exception. Subsequent generations to the 60's seem to love 60's music and Beatles music. So this adds some universality to the movie. There were several girls about 16 years old in the row in front of us in the theater - we could see they loved the music and this movie as much as we did. (My frame of reference to the movie was the hippies, protests, Vietnam War, etc. - I can't help but wonder what their frame of reference is for such a movie?)",9,3,8,6 October 2007
Bruce Almighty," Carrey preaching the gospel, strange mix, but neat movie!
","I love Jim Carrey, but the trailer bugged me a bit -- Yikes! Looked a little blasphemous to me.  And with my viewpoint as a conservative Christian, I guess it was a bit sacreligious.  But as my aunt used to say when I was growing up, 'sometimes we've just got to close our ears during the bad parts'.So, that's what I did and I have to say -- I loved this movie!  It addressed a lot of real questions, such as -- What would happen if you could get ANYTHING you want -- would it really make you happy?  Do you have to die to your old life to live a new one?  Is it really better to give than receive? Is God really punishing me when things go bad?  How do you get someone to love without messing with the free will thing? and on and on.
I was stimulated mentally and laughed my head off.  I give it 9 out of 10. (P.S. Like the way Albert Hitchcock had a 'trademark' cameo appearance, I think Carrey has developed a 'trademark' of 'accidently' sticking his butt in someone's face at least once in each of most of his movies.)",Null,0,1,31 May 2003
Mr. Holland's Opus," Good movie about dreams
","Okay, I know this movie goes off the sentimentality, sappy, manipulation chart, and I should be ashamed to be a big 51 year old man fighting the tears when I watch it by myself on my big screen TV down in the basement, but -- well, sue me -- I like this movie.  As someone once said, what is happiness but your dreams?  Those of us who are a little older may reflect on the unrealized dreams of our youth, but although some of those dreams went unrealized, some of life's events still turned out to be a lot richer than we would have ever expected.  The look on Glenne Headley's Iris as she comes to grips with who 'Rowena' is (see the movie and remember her look) gave me chills.  When Glenn Holland later says 'I love you' and she says 'I know' -- now that's a realized dream that beats being on stage at Carnegie Hall.  Relax, don't be too critical and enjoy.  I give it an 8.9 out of 10.",Null,3,4,26 May 2003
