It," I laughed more than a comedy
","When you go to see a Stephen king's book transfer to cinema you expect something 'like' this.... but it is worst than you think.... not scary , not connected right scenes, not explanations about the story, not not not.... 2 hours of my life wasted in a movie that you should avoid seeing.... the half crowd was with their mobile phone waiting to over and the rest was staring each other wondering what are we see.... American movie that may like to some but not to me....AVOID IT",1,2,6,6 October 2017
