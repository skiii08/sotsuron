The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best high-school movies out there!
","I wasn't quite impressed with the movie from the very beginning because it seemed like just another feel good drama where a shy kid learns to open-up or something! But great music and really good screenplay kept me glued to the screen. And to top it off the casting was really well done with some good names in it, so there were expectations and they didn't disappoint. The story hap major sequences where the viewers could've easily gotten bored but the background score and the soundtrack did an excellent job in entertaining the viewer throughout the movie. The climax is the best part of the movie and yeah special mention should go to the cinematography which was quite beautifully handled!",8,2,4,20 March 2013
Skyfall," Poor script led to disappointment in the end to a promising start.
","Skyfall. A really good start and a splendid performance from the antagonist almost made it sure for it to be one of the the best Bond Movies ever. But halfway through the movie fell down. Though the one- liners were sure to crack everyone up. But the lack of charisma that Craig is known for and a poor script (talking 'bout the climax sequences here) were some of the biggest flaws i the movies. Javier Bardeem should have got more screen time, he was definitely flawless. But the image of doing unexpected things that was created for the antagonist wasn't carried to the end which led to more disappointment. The last fifteen to twenty minutes or so didn't live up-to the expectation that was promised in the first half! And for the Bond fans the Aston Martin DB5 makes a comeback. ;)",5,3,10,2 November 2012
Life of Pi," A Visual Treat
",This must be the most beautiful cinematic experience I've ever had. Each and every frame is spellbinding and fascinating. This movie takes 3D to a whole new level and the chemistry between Suraj Sharma and Richard Parker is wonderful. This one is a cinematic masterpiece by Ang Lee. To deal with the concept of God in such a soft and mellow way has never been seen before. The best scene of the movie is a when a whale emerges out of a jellyfish lit ocean and jumps high in the sky before going back into the water. It is a must watch masterpiece. And will undoubtedly end in almost all the top 10 lists of 2012. The best part of this cinema is its cinematography and will be hailed as a visual treat for a long time.,8,4,8,21 December 2012
