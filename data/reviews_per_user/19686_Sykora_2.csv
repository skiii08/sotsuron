Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," worth the wait...
","I know a lot of people have had mixed feelings about this movie but I've seen it twice so far and I want to see it more.  The story is a great beginning (or continuation) and the people who play the characters are amazing.  There was not one instance in the course of the movie that I wanted it to get on with it or get over with.The Jedi fights were much better and amazing.  The music was compelling, the effects were astonishing.I am eagerly awaiting Episodes II and III now ;-)",10,0,0,24 May 1999
X-Men," My only complaint...
","My only complaint is that they gave Rogue a name.  Besides that, I thought this was THE best movie I've seen this year and THE best super hero film.The acting was excellent, especially Hugh Jackman.  He portrayed Wolverine very accurate.  I think most of the characters were accurately portrayed (except Mystique of course)... I also have never realized how boring Cyclopse is.I recommend going to see this once or twice or three times.  I know I am.",10,0,0,17 July 2000
