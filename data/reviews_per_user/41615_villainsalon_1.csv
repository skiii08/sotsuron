","If you enjoy queezy unsteady camerawork, extremely extreme closeups and angsty joyless characters, you'll like this movie. The first thing that I noticed about this movie was the awful cinematography. Every single second of this movie is unsteady and shot with a constant swaying or shakiness even though there's very little action footage. The extreme close-ups are also distracting. It's as if the cinematographer wanted the camera to closely track every hand motion and eye blink. It makes me wonder if Neil Armstrong and his team were really that sad and joyless. Every single character seemed as though they were about to have a nervous break down from beginning to end. Oh, then there was this quick thing towards the end about a moon landing or something...",3,3,5,9 December 2018
