The Hangover," Only Movie I've Ever Walked Out on!
","It was a girls night out, and we were having so much fun. We decided to go see a movie, I was dying to see the latest children's family film, but my girlfriends insisted on seeing this film that for some reason got such great reviews. I was very uncomfortable about the idea of somebody getting intoxicated, but too the point of not remembering is just awful. Well I made 10 minutes into it, and those were the worst 10 minutes of my life. Within the time frame I heard more swear words than I've ever heard before, saw more nudity than I see with my husband, and had the worst feeling watching these sinful people. I leaned over to my friend Abby and told her she could find me elsewhere (in the theater for Land of the Lost); because no way in Jesus' holy name was I watching this movie for another minute. I enjoyed that (Land of the Lost) a whole lot more, and when they (my so called friends) came out laughing at me, saying it was the funniest movie ever, I told them they better repent come Sunday, and I haven't spoken to them since then... Worst. Movie. Ever.",1,6,13,27 September 2011
Jurassic Park," 2.3 It Had Too Many Dinosaurs
","I rented this movie under the impression that it was about a theme park- not JUST dinosaurs. Instead I was hoping for a quality family film about having fun, instead I got a violent dinosaur filled movie about people running for their lives. What infuriated me the most, that caused me ultimate discomfort in this film, was the fact that it had too many dinosaurs. Maybe one dinosaur, such as Barney- you know one less violent- but instead there was a dinosaur every minute of this film. Plus I didn't find it entertaining that this nice (not Christian, but nice) family got chased around. This movie I know is considered a classic, but I don't know why. Perhaps this movie could have been slightly better if the dinosaurs hadn't been so prominent, or if it had been a friendly game of tag, or if they had went to church instead. Overall this movie is bad. Do not watch it, I recommend The Parent Trap (1998) instead.",10,1,2,5 October 2011
