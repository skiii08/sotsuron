Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good Stuff
","Kill Bill 2 reminds me off what going to the movies is all about, and I can't wait to see it again, along with KB1. if you haven't seen either film, I urge you to take a few hours to watch the first one, then roll to the theater to see the second. The roller coaster ride that you are taken on is emotional and at times funny, shocking, and horrific. The tension in KB2 is just as thick as in KB1, though there is less sword play. The strength of the movie is that that tension you crave is there but is formed through other means. Very cool movie, with lots of replay value and hidden wackyiness added by QT.",Null,1,2,17 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Congratulations to all involved!
","A true jaw dropping, fantastic film. This one is on the money, the best of the 3. To those who say it's too long...what's your hurry to get out of there? Stay in Middle Earth as long as possible. I stayed til the end of the credits, and was treated to dozens of concept sketches of characters and locals. A great way to get your blood pressure down after such a thrilling and emotional ride!",Null,0,0,17 December 2003
