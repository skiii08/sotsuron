Blade Runner 2049," waste of time
","I think the original was a great movie. This one is not worth seeing. There is a little bit of story line, very little dialogue, and not much acting; but to the actors credit, they did not have much to work with. The best performances were by the 'protein farmer', and the computerized girl friend. The scenery, lighting and soundtrack are high points. But the story line did not make me care about any of the characters. I almost fell asleep.",2,7,14,22 October 2017
