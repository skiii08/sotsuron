The New World," Waste of time and hype
","I have never been steered wrong by IMDb. But giving this movie a 7.7 is an outright shame. I have been to many movies in my lifetime but very few times have I felt so helpless as I did in the movies this evening. The story was sketchy. I went to review the movie with 3 other people and you could see people in the audience constantly leaning over to each other asking questions. My girlfriend didn't even know the main characters name at the end of the movie.The acting was not compelling. Yes I'm so sure Q'Orianka Kilcher will be nominated for something... but it will be one of those many nominations given out for the seriousness of the movie and not by the merit of the acting or power of the character. Collin Farrell once again lets you down with another poor job selling his character. Even 'BATMAN' in his brief appearance doesn't do a good job of making his character stand out and become anything more than a flash on the screen.The music was wonderful... john Williams better watch out, because this score.I say save your money and do not go. I will usually not campaign against a movie but I am 100% against anyone else going to see a movie like this.",2,4,12,21 January 2006
