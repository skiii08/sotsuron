The Hangover," Shocked beyond belief. There should be punishment for making things like this
","Wow, this is just the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything failed and I did not even smile once. It was so full of clich√©s, bad actors and over-the-top BS that I was tempted to exit the cinema, for the first time in my life. I would have if I didn't go there with friends.It's predictable, boring and a complete waste of time. The actors overact almost every scene and some of them are embarrassing to watch. I particularly disliked the guy who was always being an asshole towards the others as he seemed to be a complete douche and a waste of air. The guy named Alan was overacting in a way that is hard to describe. The one with glasses was boring and dull and the last one we didn't really see that much, which I am grateful for.This is just dick-humor, and a bad attempt at that even. This movie is a waste of money and everybody involved deserves some sort of torture directed towards their lower region.I am in shock. Even things like Epic Movie is better than this.",1,45,95,23 June 2009
