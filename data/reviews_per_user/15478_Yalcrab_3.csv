Alien 3," See it if you've seen 1 & 2 and have nothing else to do
","They could have left it at Alien.  Then, they could have left it at Aliens. But no - here it is, Alien 3 (or is it Alien Cubed).  Was it worth it? Should they have done this?  Well, yes I suppose it doesn't hurt. However, if it wasn't for Sigourney Weaver playing as Ripley (A role I feel she has been designed for) this movie would fall flat on its face.  The other characters lack (umm) character.  We know they are all going to die and it's hard to care.  Perhaps a bit of humour would have helped.The setting is quite good though.  In a way it re-creates the claustrophobic atmosphere of the original - though not, perhaps, to the same degree.  It is dark and moody, creating quite good suspence in places.  The Alien has many crevices in which to hide and Riply's means of disposing the Alien is limited.  Also this movie writes out - without any shadow of doubt - the possibility of a fourth enstalment of the Alien trilogy...",Null,0,0,27 March 1999
Armageddon," A real 'no-brainer'
","Americans Save The World - Hoorah!!  A meteor bigger than Luke Perry's ego hurtles towards earth and only Bruce Willis and his bunch of mining misfits can save us, and they do.  By saying that I cannot say I have given away the,(ahem), plot.  You cannot tell me that you didn't know that in the end everybody was going be alright, and the world saved.  This is Hollywood to the max.Nothing of the 'sci' in this 'sci-fi' is evident - it is totally unbelievable.  You can suspend reality so far while watching a movie, but not this far.  It is tripe - and the love story made me want to hurl.  In parts, it manipulates the viewer to potential sympathy.  I combated that by yelling at the movie - telling it to 'hurry up and save the world!' and assuring the pretty young girl, Lyv Tyler 'Don't worry.  I'm sure your boyfriend is still alive!'On the plus side, there are a few funny jokes and Lyv Tyler is a spunk. Grrr.I did not expect much of this movie.  However I did not anticipate a movie worse than that other disaster movie, Deep Impact.  This movie derserves a big pan, and I enjoyed giving it one.",Null,0,1,31 March 1999
There's Something About Mary," Funny? Hmm... yes,
","Ms Cameron Diaz does a very good job at acting incredibly sexy in this film. This, naturally, is not altogether suprising given that she is incredibly sexy to start with and little acting is required to extentiate that - (What a terrific smile). Matt Dillon has some comedic ability that he uses to good effect and the character Tucker was quite amusing too.  I did laugh aloud a few times but all in all - if you're after a stupid comedy - you still can't beat Dumb and Dumber.  This movie suffers a little in that although you still may not have seen it, you will almost definitely seen all the really funny bits on video previews or TV reviews.",Null,0,0,24 March 1999
