Ford v Ferrari," Gentlemen, Start Your Engines!
","GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A terrific sports film expertly crafted and a highly entertaining moviegoing experience.JIM'S REVIEW: Hollywood's fascination with the race car genre can be seen with varying degrees of success. Famous actors have felt the need for speed in their careers starting with James Garner in the Oscar-winning Grand Prix (1966), Paul Newman in Winning (1969), Steve McQueen in Le Mans (1971), Burt Reynolds in The Cannonball Run (1981), Tom Cruise in Days of Thunder (1990) and Chris Hemsworth in Rush (2013),...not to mention, the highly profitable The Fast and Furious series. Even The King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, revved up in some of his crowd-pleasing movies. Yes, it's definitely a man's world and the testosterone runs high. Now we can add James Mangold's exhilarating joy ride of a movie, Ford v Ferrari, to the list. His film is one of the best sport action films about racing ever made. Gentlemen, start your engines!Ford v Ferrari shows the competitive world of auto racing. Based on a true story, Mr. Mangold sticks mostly to the facts, although he spins his tale a bit to heighten the tension between two racing mavericks, Carroll Shelley, (Matt Damon) a former driver and car designer, and hot-headed British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and the suits at the Ford Motor Company and their interferences with them as their sponsors. Everyone's goal is to beat the No. 1 foreign sports carmaker, Ferrari, and put Ford on the map as a major competitive force in the global market.The story is not your strictly race car movie with fast cars circling lap after lap. The plot does adhere to a predictable formula although the results aren't always that telling. The screenwriting team of Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller fashion a tried-and-true tale of underdogs fighting against the system, a them vs. us story that works. They wisely do not just rely on the action scenes and take the time to build characters and relationships in between the many terrific racing sequences: the family dynamics of Carroll's wife and son, the budding bromance between Carroll and Ken, the racer and his pit crew, the white collar executives in contrast to the blue collared working man, American know-how vs. European elitism, the psychology and engineering that is involved with this sport. The film tackles bigger issues than most sport movies aspire.Actually, what added to my enjoyment of the film was my lack of knowledge about the real life events and the people involved. Far from being a race car enthusiast, my expectations about the movie were low and I was pleasantly surprised by this film's visually sweep. Credit the strong production values, fine acting, and masterful direction by Mr. Mangold.Foremost is the incredible editing by Michael McCusker and Andrew Buckland. (Their cross-cutting of race car action and personal drama is a glorious showcase of intense images seamlessly crafted, especially the nearly half hour climactic sequence of the 1966 Le Mans race.) Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is stunning in every angle, FranÃ§ois Audouy's period production design is spot-on, and the sound by Donald Sylvester, Paul Massey, David Giammarco and Steven A. Morrow brings tension and the needed authenticity to the movie. Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' music score heightens the suspense most effectively. This is technically superior filmmaking, a well-made sports movie about the love of the sport.Mr. Mangold's direction is solid if underrated. He crafts his film with style and substance. He also assembles a wonderful cast. Some may not be physically right for their roles but they deliver convincing performances throughout the movie. The chemistry with the two leads is a wonderful mix of contrasting personalities. Mr. Damon uses his likable screen persona and throws in some subtle angst and frustration to his character. Mr. Bale has the showier role but really excels in the film's quieter moments between him and his family. Both are excellent. Caitonia Balfe and Noah Jupe play Carroll's loyal wife, Mollie, and his adoring son, Peter, and they ably provide the human drama. Josh Lucas makes a very compelling villain. Rounding out the ensemble are Ray McKinnon, Remo Girone, JJ Feild, and Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca. Tracy Letts has a memorable spin as the tyrannical Henry Ford II in one of the film's best scenes.Buckle up, moviegoers! Ford v Ferrari is an action-packed thrill ride and one of the most unexpected pleasures of 2019.",9,1,2,26 January 2020
Despicable Me 2," Delightful Me Too
","This film is recommended.Minions everywhere, rejoice! Reformed evil mastermind Gru (Steve Carell) is now out of the spy business. Gru is content to while away the hours with as a typical family man with his three adopted orphans at his side. That is, until he is pulled back into the world of espionage by Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg), in Despicable Me 2, the popular sequel to this entertaining franchise.This time, Gru's mission is to stop another evil mastermind, El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who is hatching a grand scheme of world dominance using the comical minions as his prey.This film is more of the same childish shenanigans as the first. It follows its tried-and-true formula without much re-direction into its own inventiveness. But what this sequel has that the original lacked is a stronger screenplay with sly humor, better developed characters, and sight gags that are very funny. Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud create an off- kilter world that winningly pokes fun at the spy genre and make the film very family-friendly for any age demographics. The computer animation is top notch with brilliant colors and strong details. Voiceovers by Carell, Wigg, and Bratt make their characters come to life, as do the fine support by Russell Brand, Miranda Cosgrove, Elsie Fisher, Dana Gaier, and both directors who create the Minion- speak language throughout the film. The exaggerated characters, their subtle expressions, and the inspired farcical movement add to the festivities. One can't help but delight in the mindless antics and slapstick, especially whenever the Minions are on screen. They upstage everyone in the movie and are given more screen time in this film, a wise decision. Their vocal mash-ups and visual traits are the perfect antidote to chasing the blues (or purples) away.Despicable Me 2 is fun from the start to finish.

The Lobster," It Takes Two
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A partly successful mix of surreal satire with some very perceptive moments. GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: A man must choose his fate and form in a dystopian society obsessed with coupling. JIM'S REVIEW: The Lobster takes an absurd comic premise and reworks it into a dark satire about love and relationships. Set in the not-to-distant future, David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Loner, has an urgent need to find a new partner. Why the deadline, you may ask? No, it's not due to his loneliness causing him to go directly into the dating pool to find another soulmate (although he is a sad and desperate man)...it's just that he must connect with another human being in order to survive. At least, in his present form. You see, this totalitarian government stipulates that unless he gets a girl, within 45 days, he will be turned into another species..a dog, a lion, a lobster...that, at least, will be his choice in this brave new world.￼Director / Writer Yorgo Lanthimos creates a bizarre and compelling film, although he tests the patience of many moviegoers with his purposely ambiguous detours in his plot. The film is quite effective in its first half as David checks into a resort that prides itself on transformation and conformity. Irony is layered in its thick impasto strokes of surreal imagery and intellectual musings about society's obsession with coupling and partnership. Less successful is the film's second section which begins to meander and lose its way (just like its main character does). Yet the talented Mr. Lanthimos brings forth clever insights and a unique narrative to his Orwellian tale.￼The international cast works within the limits of their unusual characters. Colin Farrell portrays David nicely as a pawn in the scheme of things while other fine actors, like Rachael Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Lea Seydoux, and Olivia Coleman bring solid support to this odd yet thought-provoking film.￼But it is Lanthimos' screenplay (co-authored with Efthymis Filippou) that relies on the vague notion of obedient submissiveness that remains unclear from the start. The film lacks genuine pathos and subtle humor, never allowing its interesting subject to fully resonate. Characters remain one dimensional and their actions baffling and strange. Except for David, everyone is nameless...Nosebleed Woman, Lisping Man, Biscuit Woman, Limping Man, Short-Sighted Woman, etc. This may be an intentional decision by the filmmaker, but it does give a slight artsy silliness to the whole venture. And let's not even discuss the film's enigmatic and disappointing denouncement!However, Lanthimos is a far better director than storyteller. His use of slow motion techniques, poetic voiceovers, and mix of classical and atonal music gives his film an eerie otherworldly sense of time and place. He has his actors deliver that lines with flat readings and very little emotion which somehow works to his advantage in creating a loveless universe. ￼The Lobster is the type of film that will garner critical praise but leave the average moviegoer questioning the film's overall effect. Its characters are a passive and soulless lot, even if this filmgoing experience rarely achieves its complex goal. Still The Lobster is a noble effort by a gifted filmmaker worthy of one's attention.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,0,3,9 June 2016
Moneyball," The Games People Play
","This film is recommended.I have never been a baseball fan. The game bores me completely and I always found it to be a money-grubbing sport, even though it's still considered America's favorite past-time. The 1994 -95 Major League Baseball strike put the final kibosh on the sport for me. So I went to see the critically lauded sports film Moneyball with some bias and trepidation. Though it did not reinforce my love of the game, it did prove my initial response to be wholly accurate. And the film scores big-time, even though the subject matter still bored me sporadically.They say money can't buy you happiness, but it sure as hell can buy you a winning team. Or so Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt ), manager of one of the lowest paying team, the Oakland Athletics, believes, as he finds himself battling the odds with his players against those damn Yankees and other pro teams. Billy builds a strong winning team only to have his best players hired out from under him. Enter the nerd, Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill ), baseball statistician and Yale graduate, with a plan for the Oakland A's and Billy to succeed. But it's the team manager, a gruff and unbelieving Art Howe ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman ) that doesn't hold kindly to the Ivy Leaguer and his aggravating boss interfering in the Major League business of baseball championships.The dry subject of statistical analysis of baseball players and their point averages may weigh heavily with your enjoyment of this film, but Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin take this nominal and unexciting premise and run with it with their literate and expertly written screenplay. Although they may not totally succeed in their exposition and narrative clarity of the numerical plan that Beane and Brand hatch, they wisely give much screen time to Billy and his witty banter with Peter, plus show his paternal side with his loving daughter ( a charismatic Kerris Dorsey ) to full effect.Director Bennett Miller's use of baseball montages and statical numbers as graphic images delivers a nice visual look to the film. The director also assembles a crackerjack A-team of players. Leading the cast is Brad Pitt who adds to his impressive resume with another heartfelt performance. Ecstatically and statistically speaking, this actor's average as a major talent grows with every film he chooses lately. Hill has never been more appealing as his nebbish of a business partner. Especially strong is Hoffman as Billy's doubting nemesis. More screen time and further scenes of conflict with this fine actor and Pitt would have only enhanced this fine film even more.Moneyball triumphs with its behind the scenes look at baseball and its quick-witted dialog and vivid characters. As previously mentioned, I still don't have a love of the game, nor did I love this film, but I did love the masterful performance of Brad Pitt and his fellow acting pros.

The Avengers," The Real Super Pac
","This film is recommended.Like those silly late-night infomercials found on cable television stations nationwide, with their cut-rate deals and instant add-ons used to entice any viewer to immediately buy into their product while supplies last, we unassuming consumers are there as gullible pawns bombarded by all the hype and promotion for the first of many summer blockbusters, namely Marvel's The Avengers, a movie that safeguards its Marvel franchise by adding, not one, not two, but six popular superheroes into the mix of action, fantasy, and adventure. The question remains: Is it worthy of your time and hard-earned cash, or just another disappointing come-on?Well, without any warranty or guarantee, I can safely state that The Avengers exacts its vengeance upon all those other lackluster dim-witted comic book archetypes that sullied the name of its genre in the past, with dreck that was recently foisted on the movie-going public, in films like The Green Lantern, Watchmen, and Captain America. Well...WHAMM! BAM! KAPOW!... This highly entertaining film knocks it out of the park, with one fell swoop of its mighty hammer, American shield, and its major muscle action. This pic uses its well defined pecs again, to right that injustice, thanks to the superpowers of its director / director, Joss Whedon and Industrial Light & Magic. The film is all action sequences strung together to elicit enough excitement for the fan-boys and teenage crowd and still amuse the older set.A team of super humans, mutants, and even a demi-god have been assembled to save the Earth from destruction, a simple but overused formula that sets the stage for explosions, chases, and super effects. S.H.I.E.L.D. ( Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division, with an emphasis on the E and not much evidence of the L word ), run by Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ), who wears an eye-patch and a scowl so you know he's a serious threat, enlists the aid of Ironman ( Robert Downey ) Captain America ( Chris Evans ), and the mighty Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ). Also joining the crew for this outing are Mark Ruffalo as the introspective Bruce Banner aka The Hulk, a welcome addition, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, with his never-ending illogical supply of arrows, and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, a kick-butt in-your-face heroine, as they fight against the evil Loki ( Tom Hiddleston ), ready to unleash his lethal ball of gamma rays or, more precisely, his blue energy cube known as Tesseract, the McGuffin of the story. That's all you really need to know. There's not much depth of character, dramatic readings, or intricate plot in this type of movie genre. Let's face it, it's all about the action set pieces, the clever one-liners, and the CGI that you've come to see. And there's plenty of that!Fortunately, this group of 'freaks' take their loner status personally and Whedon wisely deals with their individual 'uniqueness' in clever ways, having some of the superheroes relishing their powers while others question their calling. These personalities have nothing in common, except for wielding their power and zingers at random. Yet they are forced to unite, for the good of mankind, and become a team in this Super Bowl of Mayhem.The production values are top-notch and the use of 3-D is quite effectively done with its subtle use of foreground, middle, and background perspectives. Kudos to cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and the fine art direction by James Chinlund. The film is also enhanced by Alan Silvestri's musical score that never overpowers its imagery and impressive use of sound editing that layers the lively action on screen.The actors bring much humor and grace to their characters and their quirks, especially strong are Johansson as the red-haired leather-clad dynamo and Ruffalo, who underplays his role as the conflicted green menace to maximum effect, although I still have a problem with The Hulk's expandable pants malfunction. ( There is one unexpected comic scene during the climactic battle that may become a classic cinematic moment. ) Downey's urban egotistical playboy hero and Evan's clean-cut and slightly dopey Captain make good contrasting foils in their approach to problem-solving. In his underwritten role as Thor, Hemsworth is not given much complexity this time around. Perhaps, most importantly, the villain of the story is played by Hiddleston, who has perfected a smarmy sneer of a smile, reminiscent of Ledger's Riddler without the jungle red lipstick and whiteface make-up. He makes a terrific villain, which needs to be the case if a film like this is to succeed.And succeed it does. While it is true that too much of the film is the typical crash and burn found in action films nowadays, and much of the clash and combat sequences are of the titanic variety and go on for far too long, Marvel's The Avengers is one of the better examples of comic book fantasy films that not only engages but completely satisfies its movie-going audiences with its excellent visual effects and thrills. As a film, Marvel's The Avengers is an efficient marvel of filmmaking that lives up to its own hype. KAPOW!

Blade Runner 2049," Visually Stunning, But Running on Empty
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Eye-popping visuals a-plenty, but the film delivers little for the mind.SYNOPSIS: A 'blade runner' searches for a missing person in this sci-fi epic.JIM'S REVIEW: I remember seeing the original Blade Runner back in 1982 and being transported to a strange new world. The starkly lit visuals, well staged action sequences by Ridley Scott, and the macho Harrison Ford made the movie-going experience quite memorable. The plot, however, was a confusing mess and I truly never understood the rapturous cult adoration that followed. Now, after 35 years, comes its sequel, Blade Runner 2049, and oddly, the overall effect of this new replica about replicants is mostly the same old, albeit quite dazzling, but a bit more boring and a lot more addled this time around.In truth, Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most visually arresting movies of the year. Now at the helm of the film is Denis Villeneuve, a very skilled director. He brings his powerful images to the forefront, but over intellectualizes the film to the point of confusion. He is taking us on an epic sci-fi journey, the mere length of the film, clocking in at nearly 3 hours, wants to indicate its greatness, as if size really matters.Yet the film hopelessly meanders from one tedious plot point to the next, with many scenes that cry out for some judicious editing and characters in need of better clarity. As the film relies on a convoluted script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, it tries to construct an involving and coherent narrative and never really succeeds. It is the woeful screenplay that needs a major reboot as it continually short circuits all the artistry on display.The absolutely stunning photography by the great Roger Deakins pays perfect homage to the neon noir color tones and stark lighting effects of its predecessor and his lens captures an array of contrasting places, from the dusty amber sandstorms of a dystopian Las Vegas to the urban squalor of Los Angeles with its giant female objectified holograms showing the chaotic future. Wonderful production design by Dennis Gassner adds to the film's visual look...absolutely gorgeous. The CGI by is stunning also.The film is very well cast, with Mr. Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard with the needed gratis. His presence immediately legitimizes the project. Ryan Gosling, quite convincing as K, a tough shamus trying to solve his case, is very strong in his role as well. There is a nice chemistry between both actors once they cross paths, which unfortunately takes nearly two hours to fulfill that cinematic promise for avid moviegoers. Also giving fine support are Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, and Sylvia Hoeks who makes one mean villain. Only Jared Leto seems out of place in a poorly written role as an evil entrepreneur / oracle figure that want to control the replicant population. He lacks real menace and slows down an already slow story-line.So it is with mixed results that I recommend this film. Blade Runner 2049 is certainly worthy of your attention for its sheer visual accomplishments. Imagine a sci-fi film with touches of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, and a little Terrence Malick pretension thrown in to reach that metaphysical level of awe, and you have the essence of Mr. Villeneuve's eye-fetching film. Beautiful to behold, but the mind longs for more.",7,3,7,11 October 2017
First Man," A Solid Moon Landing
","GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A bio-pic that is dazzling in its visuals but lacking in real emotional drama.JIM'S REVIEW: Damien Chazelle's masterful yet emotionally inert film, First Man, tells the saga of Neil Armstrong and the Apollo space program. Technically, the film is so well crafted and detail driven, but the personal backstory of Armstrong's marriage and family life is never really given equal treatment. So the overall impact delivers more to be admired than exulted.Ryan Gosling play this American hero as an introverted loner unable to express any remorse or compassion to those he loves. He hides his feelings and pent-up rage frequently like those stereotypical 60's men did to shield themselves from any direct interaction. This is a fine approach, and Mr. Gosling has his solitary moments to shine. The actor is more than up to the task of filling in the gaps in his character.His wife, Janet, is very well played by Claire Foy but her character too is intense and aloof. With a literate screenplay by Josh Singer, both characters, as written, are so uptight and guarded that moviegoers are kept at an emotional distance. While one can relate to the stress and sadness in their marriage, their scenes together never mesh as effectively as they should.Yet it is the sequences of outer space exploration that have a rare beauty that continually impress in their execution. The film achieves high marks with its talented artisans' contributions: Linus Sandgren's photography efficiently contrasts the claustrophobic space within the capsules with its hand-held camerawork and the panoramic vistas of outer space and the moon's terrain. Visually, the film has powerful imagery throughout that is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's iconic 2001 and, more recently, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity and its CGI artistry. The film editing by Tom Cross creates the tension and suspense with his many close-ups and kinetic fast cuts. Nathan Crowley's production design that has all of the period details and more. The music score by Justin Hurwitz is selective in its blending of quieter lyrical sounds with more bombastic fanfare. Kudos to all!Mr. Chazelle's direction, especially in his lengthy re-enactment of the moon landing, is skillfully rendered. He has truly researched his subject of space exploration but seems more involved in depicting the historic aspects of the Apollo program and showing all of that visual splendor. In doing so, he sacrifices the smaller story of a common man whose dreams became a reality at a very high cost.First Man celebrates our early space explorers and the risks they took to achieve greatness. This film never reaches that zenith, but it remains grandiose filmmaking that sets the bar high. Even if it doesn't shoot the moon, it comes very close.",9,1,4,24 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Hunger Pains
","This film is not recommended.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is the third installment of this series. And it's getting progressively worse. This Hunger Games 3 is an incomplete complete mess. It should be more accurately called Hunger Games 2½, as it ends abruptly with the sole purpose to rake in more money from its movie-going audience. However, I do agree with the downtrodden in this film: let's start the revolution, but aim it against the Hollywood studios and their greed.The film starts off immediately from where we ended in Part Two. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has be taken by rebel forces and her love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), has been left behind at the Capitol, captured by the evil President Snow while her close friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) pines forlornly for her. Katniss discovers that her hometown, District 12 has been destroyed and a new band of fighters have joined forces to overthrow the corrupt government, led by female president elect Coin (Julianne Moore, speaking in a low monotone voice that is suppose to resemble authority) who wants Katniss to become their spokesperson and leader of the uprising, its Mockingjay. Misdirected by Francis Lawrence, who doesn't build any tension in this part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is so S-L-O-W that it appears lifeless. While the other previous films had some spark and wit to them, this one is dreary and sanctimonious. Everyone is way too serious or bland or ready to cry a single tear to show that they are really hurting inside. Believe me, it's the audience that should be crying! A feeling of distress felt by these characters overcame me in the same way as I watched this dreadful film.The actors, especially Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine and a smirking self-righteous Donald Sutherland, do a yeoman-like job with a script that is filled with filler and lots of talk, but very little action. The script by Peter Craig and Danny Strong plods along with none of the speechifying being credible or interesting. Many of the more colorful characters established in this series are undervalued and underused. Fleeting moments of pleasure are given by Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and the aforementioned Josh Hutcherson. They are mere afterthoughts to the dull sluggish plot. Only the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as a controlling empowered publicist Plutarch Heavensbee and Elizabeth Banks as the vain Effie make an impression, giving the film a hint of comic relief it sorely needs.For a sci-fi adventure film, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 has very little of both, and no hunger games at all. This is one of the more disappointing sequels ever made, not deserving of one more chapter, let alone two. Teens may enjoy this dumb movie, but I suffered hunger pains watching this insufferable movie.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Cap't Jack is Back!
","Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides This film is recommended. 'Captain Jack will get you high tonight, And take you to your special island.'-Billy JoelAvast ye mateys! Cap't Jack is back in the fourth installment of the Pirates franchise. This time we're set sail to find the Fountain of Youth! ( That sums up the entire plot and Depp depth of the film in about 10 words! ) Returning in full comic glory once again is Johnny Depp as the mincing boozy buccaneer, Cap't Jack Sparrow. Depp, ( in his words ) using inspiration from Keith Richards of Stones fame and PePe LePew of Looney Toons glory, plays his most famous comic creation with wry perfection. Also on board this trip is his once evil adversary, Barbossa ( an especially droll Geoffrey Rush ) and the newly eviler Blackbeard, played with true menace by Ian McShane. Penelope Cruz plays Jack's former paramour, Angelina. The role wastes the talents of this fine actress and she adds very little combustibility or comic timing to her underdeveloped role as his overdeveloped tempestuous love interest. Missing this time are Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, but substituting for their roles as eye candy in this formulaic adventure ride of a film are Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena the Little Mermaid, and Sam Clafin as the handsome and hunkiest of all missionaries, Philip. ( More people would become devout members of his congregation with him as their spiritual leader. ) Unfortunately also missing in the film's script is much of the wit and humor of the original.What there's plenty of is action, from well staged sword fights, daring escapes, and vampy vampire-like mermaids ( a mighty nice special effect, and I might add, the best section of the film ). At the helm of this film is Rob Marshall, who choreographs the festivities as if he were creating one big production number after another. He keeps everything moving at a clip, although many of the action sequences become monotonous exercises in expert stunt work or enhanced state-of-the-arts CGI, lacking any real spark or tension. The film certainly doesn't bore its audience with its numerous action packed scenes to hold one's interest. But Marshall sacrifices character development and plot details to make a film that almost seems desperate to keep everything and everyone afloat and doesn't leave any time for bona fide thrills or laughs.Production values are still of the highest caliber: rousing music by Hans Zimmer, lush photography by the talented Dariusz Wolski, glorious costumes by Lucy Bevan , and remarkable production design by John Myhre. Yes, there were many gold doubloons spent on the film's lavish budget. Money seemed to be no obstacle.The only real obstacle was the screenplay itself. If only this thin story had some meat too it. It's lean pickings. The script, credited to 5 writers and headed by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, seemed to be rote and wrote by committee as well. The dialogue lacks wit and the storyline seems trivial. The subplot of mismatched young lovers is strictly recycled Hans Christian Anderson, rated PG, while the exploits and escapades of Cap't Jack and his roguish crew this time around seem predictable and rather listless. Yet, the adventure saga still remains entertaining, primarily due to Depp's delightful tongue-in-cheek interpretation and the sumptuous visual look of the film. Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides perpetuates the pirate myth of yore. There is nothing new or exciting in this blockbuster fantasy adventure yarn. We get more of the expected sameness from this successful film series rather than genuine unexpected moments. Although Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides still provides enough frothy pleasure, the tides are just starting to become a bit shallow on this particular voyage.

Men in Black 3," MIB3: Time is Not Their Friend
","This film is not recommended.The successful Men in Black series has finally turned three this year, after a 10 year hiatus. It still tries to incorporate its winning formula of sardonic humor, otherworldly creatures, and top-notch visual effects. However this time, it throws in time travel as a plot device, making this installment all the more warped, yet somehow less entertaining.The plot remains simple: Agent J, with excessive mugging from Will Smith, travels back in time to 1969 to save the life of his partner Agent K ( an underused Tommy Lee Jones ), but more importantly, save the world from yet another alien invasion. Perhaps they should have save the time and money and reworked the screenplay instead.Men in Black III was plagued with many re-writes as the script was incomplete when production started. And this lack of cohesiveness shows. But, at least, this high concept blockbuster brings to its third sequel the clever concept of time travel and its most creative idea of casting Josh Brolin as Tommy Lee Jones' younger self. It is a brilliant move that pays off and elevates a film that suffers from plot lows and too many non-comedic highs.Barry Sonnenfeld, who helmed the original first film, still brings his inventive flair for direction to the series. Unfortunately, the script by Etan Cohen lacks real humor and peril. Interesting characters, like Emma Thompson's Agent O and Nicole Scherzinger as Boris the Animal's girlfriend, are introduced, dispatched, or are no longer involved with the plot mechanics. The production design by Bo Welch continue to have a creative edge, but the creatures, this time around, are not very innovative or as amusing as before. Plus, the CGI is rather unexceptional and humdrum ( as is the 3-D format ).The droll banter that was a comic staple in the previous installments is sorely missing and there are so many lost opportunities poking fun at the late sixties trends and 'vibes' that could have made the film's reversal of time refreshing and nostalgic while it engages its movie-going audience. None of that happens.As for the acting, it's nondescript. Smith tries to be charming and hip and fails miserably. Jones seems to be walking through his role, adding no depth of character. There is absolutely no chemistry with Smith or his younger or older partner for that matter. The film's bland one-dimensional villain, Boris the Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, has no truly interesting traits, except throwing deadly stakes at intended victims and grousing in a studio- enhanced voice that reverberates too often and is merely artificial and annoying. The only two actors that come off unscathed are the aforementioned Brolin, who steals the film with his uncanny impersonation of Agent K which produces some needed laughs, and Michael Stuhlbarg who delivers some emotional heft and boyish charm as a new character named Griffin who can see the future.I suppose that Men in Black III may be a mindless diversion from some moviegoers. But, for me, it became a pointless exercise that regurgitated its formulaic sci-fi fantasy elements with no real payoff. The film ultimately disappoints and loses its own sense of originality and whimsy in this third outing. One doesn't need the memory eraser device used by the agents in Men in Black III. The film will do that very well on its own as you are immediately leaving the theater.

Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Nothing Up My Sleeve ( Or In My Head ), Dear Watson!
","This film is not recommended.Those crazy cut-ups are back! Yes, in the tradition of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and Martin & Lewis comes Holmes and Watson, once again in a rip-roaring comedy adventure romp that brings thrills and action to the forefront while leaving reason and logic in its dust. This sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, continues the revisionist mode that made the first film so very popular. While it's not to my personal purist taste, the film is mildly diverting but elementarily unsatisfying.Yes, it's more of the same formula as the last installment: a mystery is afoot, solved not so much by the powers of reason and deduction. Instead, it's the explosions, gunfire, disguises, comic shenanigans, and some minor sleuthing on the side with a decidedly modern twist for today's younger audiences that embodies this Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as the resourceful Sherlock and his doctor friend and their gimmicky misadventures ensue.The plot this time around concerns the evil Professor Moriarty ( a formidable Jared Harris ) who wants to profit from the war any illegal way he can. It's not that deep or though- provoking. In fact, it's simplistic, obvious, and not the least bit involving. The script has its creative limits, with its anachronistic joking and puns. Previously the first film introduced elements of the the occult which made that film hackneyed and tired. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows leaves those elements behind and now it tries to wisely plays up the political drama and intrigue on a more realistic scale. Unfortunately, this sequel is even more simplistic, obvious, and less interesting than its predecessor. Of course, it's still up to Holmes and Watson to stop the villainous professor. Of course, it's still the exquisitely detailed sets and high octane set pieces that are the series' trademarks to success. Of course, it's still the frenzied editing of the film that invigorates the mystery. But the film, though technically adept, is a muddled mess in the script department. The true culprit is not Moriarty, it's screenwriters Michele and Kieran Mulroney who are to blame for their less than stellar contribution to this series.All of the expert direction is by Guy Ritchie, who again helms this franchise. But he cannot disguise the gaping holes of logic and inconclusive storytelling. Ritchie knows how to keep the action flowing with his stylish kinetic movement and stop action techniques ( which become far too repetitive and overstay their welcome ). Nothing ever lulls. This is robust filmmaking and there's no time to think about any loopholes with the script or its characters. It's ADHD time, fast, loose, and impulsive. Keep it moving by all means possible. Perhaps one sequence, a beautifully choreographed montage of still images and action shots, provides a clue to the film's visceral adrenaline rush and its lack of emotional connection and build-up. The high point of the film comes as our heroes try to escape an attack in the forest, bullets ricochet off the trees in an almost slo-mo ballet of sorts as the figures weave and dance around the exploding shards of wood. The fragmenting in this woodland environ is exquisitely photographed by Philippe Rousselot and enhanced by the Hans Zimmer's musical score. One can admire the imagery in this scene and many others. Yet this overall effect continually undercuts any tension or suspense and distances the moviegoer from any real integration to the non-stop action on the screen. The actors seem to be relishing their roles and hoping the moviegoers like the film's tongue- in-cheek humor and daredevil stunts. Their 'bromance' continues in the capable hands of pros like Downey and Law. Their chemistry remains palpable and their comic timing cannot be faulted. While there are some weaknesses with some of the other cast members, particularly an underused Noomi Rapace and overindulgent Stephen Fry as mere comic relief, they really never advance the plot but they don't interfere with the escapist mood of the film either. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a game of deception, but not of shadows as its title may suggest. Instead, the film plays a game of smoke and mirrors with the audience, trying to grab their attention although it really has no substance or clear vision in its empty head. Its sleight-of-hand may manipulate some critics or moviegoers with its cheap thrills, but its visual tricks are slight indeed.

The Monuments Men," Far from Monumental
","This film is not recommended.The Monuments Men tells the supposedly true story of a group of art lovers who fought to preserve the world's art treasures from the Nazis during World War II. Their on-going battle for acceptance from fellow Army officers and soldiers and their dangerous assignment takes them behind enemy lines and becomes the centerpiece for the film and its acting ensemble. This platoon of quirky artsy types join forces to accomplish their mission: rescue and retrieve art masterpieces and return them safely to their owners. The NEA would certainly gives its seal of approval and probably provide funding. I, on the other hand, found the film to be, shall I say, serviceable and competent.Directed, written, and starring George Clooney, The Monuments Men takes this actual event and trivializes its significance by making it a predictable World World II melodramatic film that John Wayne would wholeheartedly endorse. Clooney plays Frank Stokes, an art historian and connoisseur of the finer things in life, a role perfectly suited for the actor. Stokes assembles a squadron of talented American aesthetes skilled in their own particular field of expertise: James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban). He also adds to the mix one Briton, Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), one Frenchman named Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), and a Parisian mademoiselle / translator / love interest, Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) to lend more international flavor and fervor to the cause. Needless to say, the names of these characters have been changed to protect the real-life heroes. The actors involved with this project should have asked for a nom de plume clause in their contract as well. All try their best to add some depth to their sketchy characters and have done better work than seen here. There are some snags along the way, both in the film's plot and its execution. The film's major flaw is its script, co-authored by Clooney and Grant Heslov. It follows a throughly conventional formula with its one-dimensional types substituted for well-drawn characters who rarely resemble their real-life counterparts. (A romance between Simone and Granger is based on pure fiction.) The film is choppy and episodic as it jumps from one encounter to the next. Too many scenes consist of endless speeches decrying the weightiness of art, its cultural legacy, and America's stoicism above all else. It's as if the filmmakers need to convince themselves and their movie-going audience the significance of these brave men and their saintly quest. The Monuments Men constantly overstates their cause and effect.But this is old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making, a patriotic crowd-pleasing throwback to a slice of American heroics of long ago. We've seen this all so many times before in better war dramas from the 60's. (Films like The Longest Day, The Guns of Navarone, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, and The Great Escape easily come to mind and are superior films worth multiple viewings. This film is not.) Production values remain strong and its period details are fine, the only exception being the usually reliable Alexandre Desplat and his intrusive and annoying film score that becomes a self-parody of war movie musical clichés.￼The Monuments Men is informative and entertaining, but it never rises to the degree of exciting or memorable. Far from monumental, The Monuments Men becomes a mere footnote in the annuals of art and cinematic history. Their valiant story deserves better.

Captain Phillips," Victory at Sea
","This film is highly recommended.The talented director, Paul Greengrass, has successfully tackled the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and his 2009 ordeal in the new docudrama, Captain Phillips. The film tells the harrowing story of Somali pirates, armed with automatic weapons, boarding and hijacking an unarmed American cargo ship and holding its crew at ransom.The director's trademark pseudo-real, in-your-face photography is front and center with his jittery hand-held camera-work and multiple close-ups used to build the tension of a hostage situation, a technique that he used so famously in United 93 and two of the Bourne installments. Using a cinéma vérité style of filmmaking, there is a quasi-documentary approach to the story which works so effectively in this film. The script by Billy Ray tries to present both of of the hijacking. He shrewdly begins his narrative with some background scenes of Phillips' typical ordinary day with his wife (an underused Catherine Keener) in his suburban community and contrasts that with the squalor and poor living conditions of a Somali village, where the desperate men are forced into making a criminal choice, all this prior to the violent act that will bring both parties together. Desperation is the running theme in Captain Phillips. Men with no hope and no options, forced into illegal acts of brutality. An innocent man placed into a life-and-death waiting game. The results between these two dissimilar types are catastrophic as we watch the battle of captor and captives unfold.Casting is foremost if we are to believe in this situation, and Greengrass has done a exemplary job by having Tom Hanks in the title role. This is one of Hanks' best performances ever. He plays this Everyman with an earnestness and directness, trying to outwit his kidnappers one moment and sensitively understanding their plight, although the character, as written, seems a bit too heroic and courageous at times. The actor underplays the fear and carefully sidesteps the selflessness of Phillips, making him less virtuous and more human. Hanks' definitive final scene packs the emotional wallop needed to register to the audience that this is a common man placed in unusual peril, not a superhero. The lingering aftermath of this traumatic nightmare and the film's parting image of Hanks is highly emotional and gut-wrenching, distilling all of his bottled-up anguish and misery into one memorable scene.As Muse, the Somali leader of the kidnappers, Barkhad Abdi (in his first acting role), brings the perfect degree of menace and tragedy to his character. His physical leanness and intense stare only adds to the suspense and the overall horror of this terroristic act. Playing the hijackers are Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysai Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali, all of which bring major support to their characters and their volatile relationships.Unlike most films today, Captain Phillips is more substance than style, sans gimmicks and intrusive visual sleight of hand. The film is an old fashion drama (and I mean that in the best sense), well-crafted and sensitively told, with strong narrative drive, superb direction, and a commanding performance by Hanks as Captain Phillips. This is a great film. GRADE: A-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",10,2,5,16 October 2013
Sucker Punch," There's a movie born every minute too...
","(Not Recommended) That sound you might here in the distance may be the ka-ching of the cash register as this film rakes in millions from unsuspecting moviegoers, or the grumbling from a disapproving audience of movie fans in love with graphic novel adaptations and video games. Yes, the latest loud, crass, and bombastic film from Zack Snyder, Sucker Punch ( with an emphasis on the first syllable, I might add ), has now entered the movie arena and you have now been officially warned! So prepare yourself if you choose to attend its screening for two full hours of utter nonsense or wisely avoid this movie at all costs if you have any common sense ( which the film itself sorely lacks ).The lame brained plot is a mere outline of a film without a real script. Meet Babydoll, ( Emily Browning ) who befriends Sweet Pea ( Abbie Cornish ), Rocket ( Jena Malone ), Blondie, whose a brunette ( Vanessa Hudgens ), and Amber ( Jamie Chung ). All of the actors overdo their roles and deserve better material than this.This miserable and senseless onslaught of mayhem is meant to be camp, but it lacks any real wit or humor. Sucker Punch is the equivalence of visual static. It's a series of music videos strung together posing as a coherent movie. Highly influenced in the Michael Bay School of Filmmaking, the film is full of noise, explosions, gunfire, and crashes. ( I would be amiss if I didn't state that the film's director, Zack Snyder, does have a strong visual sense of filmmaking. He keeps the action sequences moving at a quick pace, except for his overuse of anachronistic pop songs and slo-mo effects. But it is his writing skills that are also old- fashioned and lazy, desperately in need a reboot. He's become a poor man's David Lynch with a nod to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. )His film aspires to be just a teenage fan boy fantasy, a movie display of female eye candy who fight Nazi zombies, dragons, robots, and other Gameboy obstacles, dispensing justice with cutting edge swords and state of the arts computer effects. Sadly, Snyder has more to offer than this pap.Sucker Punch is a bloated mash-up of violence, action, and sex ( in descending order). The film has no redeeming value except for its visual kinetic style which put me in sensory overload within the first half hour. Sucker Punch will affront your senses and leave you breathless with its boldness and audacity. It certainly reinforced its title claim for anyone who comes near this film mess ( with an emphasis on the first word, I might add ). It is undoubtedly one of the worst films of this year.

10 Cloverfield Lane," Gimme Shelter
","￼(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A sequel that has its own life, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a nifty little thriller.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Trapped inside a bunker with strangers, an injured woman must decide which is the safer place for her.￼JIM'S REVIEW: Less is more, especially when trying to solve a mystery. The fun is in unraveling the clues and following them to their logical conclusion. (It was Colonel Mustard, in the Conservatory, with a Candlestick.) No spoilers here! The less you know about the plot of 10 Cloverfield Lane, the more enjoyment you will have in this classic detective game. ￼With that in mind, I will only expose the set-up. Three characters are hold up in a bunker with the threat of world annihilation above. But is that really the case? Is the evil within or just out of reach? Which haven is the safer choice?John Goodman plays Howard, the unhinged (or completely sane) master of the house. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Michelle, his guest (or prisoner). It is essentially a two-character drama as tensions mount between them. John Gallagher, Jr., in a smaller role, plays Emmitt, the third party in this match-up. ￼Under Dan Trachtenberg's astute direction, all of the actors are solid. Their give-and-take with the characters pays off convincingly. The film mashes up the sci-fi genre with the mystery quite nicely. The damsel-in distress moments build to a frenzied and taut survival lesson, with some unexpected twists and turns along the way. Credit the creative screenplay by a trio of talented writers, Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken, and Damien Chazelle. Their script wisely stays focused on the personal level between the characters and their apocalyptic dilemmas. The claustrophobic elements are front and center and add to the suspense, as does Stefan Grube's editing. Ramsey Avery's set-piece provides some wonderful insightful touches (and clues) in its home-sweet-home feel. ￼Like all mystery thrillers, the ending will either satisfy you or not, depending on how much you have personally invested in this charade and the believability in the film's narrative. (I was fine with the ending and found it did fulfill my expectations, with a few questions still unanswered, but then I am a stickler for logical sense in my thrillers.) 10 Cloverfield Lane combines all the attributes we require from psychological thrillers, sci-fi films, and horror stories quite efficiently which makes the film creepy fun.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,2,6,13 March 2016
Source Code," Everybody deserves a second chance, although Colter Stevens has about eight chances to redo history in eight minutes or less.
","That modern day classic film, Inception, has already influenced today's filmmaking studios with its artistry and its monetary grosses. Just go to your nearest movieplex and you'll see other films about mind control games, like the two more recent hits, Limitless, and The Adjustment Bureau. Now comes yet a third...Source Code is the latest in this genre, a time warped story about time travel to a parallel universe. It's the clever Groundhog Day formula re-imagined as an action thriller with the same tired déjà vu structure of Vantage Point, set aboard a moving train. ( I know, it's also reminiscent of hundreds of other sci-fi diversions like Back to the Future, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect, and the Terminator series; action hits, like Speed, Unstoppable, and Run, Lola, Run; romantic movies like Sliding Doors and Time After Time, and even television series like Mission Impossible, 24, and Lost, to name a few others. )But Source Code wisely takes its lead from those other films and stays on track pretty much of the time. The film begins with a puzzling dilemma: a soldier awakens on a train to find himself in the body of another person and on a train that will self destruct in 8 minutes. He is also hooked up to mind control operatives headed by the military who are in charge of a secret experimental program called Source Code who give our hero a mission to save mankind: Find the bomber and prevent this and other terroristic attacks from happening. Now granted the circumstances are enough to shock anyone, let alone our protagonist. But with a name like Colter, you know he's the right one for this job and he means business. The appealing Jake Gyllenhaal is perfectly cast. As he tries to unravel the mystery, the audience immediately is held in rapt attention due to the topnotch direction by Duncan Jones, a wonderful convoluted script by Ben Ripley, and a fine cast of performers. Michelle Monaghan plays Christina, Cotter's short-lived love interest who keeps coming back for more. Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright effectively serve the plot as major catalysts heading this mission. Not only is Source Code a tense thriller, but it's a nifty whodunit as well. The film tries to remain logical and intriguing, although there are one too many twisty plot devices that tend to border on overdrive. Add to that mix, a stilted familiarity of the scenes being constantly replayed and reversed time and time again that becomes somewhat tedious and strained.Still, most of the time, it's edge-of-your-seat excitement and suspense. Source Code has much to admire. It is a well crafted, intelligent, and entertaining joyride. GRADE: B",7,3,5,3 April 2011
Skyfall," Double A-Bond Rated
","This film is highly recommended.Bond, James Bond, may like his martinis shaken not stirred, but this latest installment of this popular movie franchise is far from shaky and quite a stirring example of how to make a perfectly synchronized action thriller. Let us count the reasons that Skyfall, the 23rd Bond film in this series, is the best Bond movie since Goldfinger:1. The foremost reason for the film's success is Daniel Craig as Mr. Bond, either fully clothed or the preferable shirtless variety. Craig may have the face of a longshoreman, but his tight sculpted body is probably the film's best visual effect ( and there are many from which to choose ). The actor has the physicality of a brutish daredevil one moment and a sophisticated playboy the next. His is the perfect combination in a perfect suited ( or unsuited ) role. Craig has become the strongest Bond since Connery and this is due to his common man status in playing this super-spy. He plays this role as a flawed loner, an anti-hero who loyalty to country and service are more important than his own self-being. It's all personal to him and that makes his interpretation even more exciting.2. The film's screenplay by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan, keeps its ties to reality, unlike most of the previous installments. Though darker in mood and more somber in its focus, Skyfall achieves its goal as a suspenseful action-packed thriller with a more serious message of cyber-terrorism. Even if the script stretches the limits of logic with its dangerous action stunts at times, its central plot builds its tension from its well-written characters and their volatile situations. One scene realistically impacts on the next. 3. Skyfall is filled with action. The stunt work continues to amaze with its thrilling showmanship and staging. From its riveting opening fight scenes on various means of transportation to a chase in and under London's subway tunnels, the film easily delivers. In fact, the final action sequence is a bit of a letdown when compared to the other set pieces before it. ( Most effective: The Shanghai fight scene, well-choreographed and gorgeously lit, as silhouetted figures contrast against the bold neon-colored backdrops. Truly dynamic filmmaking. ) 4. A diabolical villain is yet another ingredient in the mix and Javier Bardem fills that role as Silva nicely. Although he doesn't make his appearance until an hour or so into the proceedings, the actor more than makes up for his elapsed screen time with his memorable performance. With his stark white mane and sinister laugh, Bardem uses all of his character's eccentricities to his fullest advantage. He even has some shared human moments to soften his villain before maiming and destroying anyone in his way. 5. The supporting cast adds greater interest to the story. Judi Dench brings her signature no- nonsense attitude to her continuing role as M, Bond's superior. She is the consummate actress in any role, large or small. New additions to the series are the beautiful Naomie Harris as Eve, Ben Whislaw as Q, the cyber and weapons geek, and Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, the overseer of the secret service division.6. Sam Mendes is the director. Known more for his straight dramatic films like American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes acquits himself well in his first real action film. He stages his scenes well and keeps the action moving at a quick pace. He also doesn't neglect the dramatic storyline and the character's inter-relationships, making those elements as important to the film as the adrenaline rush of chases and explosions. One has to admire Mendes as he makes sure that the over-the-top temptation to focus more on gadgetry and super stunts are kept to a minimum.7. The gadgets are still there. No, they are not as lavish as before, but they make logical sense and are used sparingly whenever possible. Why even the Aston Martin of yore is brought back to the plot, amid some applause from the movie-going audience! ( This film likes to relish in the mythology of its own series' history. )8. Skyfall may have fewer Bond Ladies this time around, but they make their presences known and the actresses are more than merely shapely decorations and sexual objects on view. Both Bérénice Marlohe as Severin and the previously mentioned Ms. Harris add depth to their somewhat sketchy roles. 9. The exotic locations are back. Shanghai, Macao, Istanbul, Turkey, and Scotland are some of the backdrops for the many action sequences in Skyfall, adding to the fun and authenticity of the film.10. Finally, the top-notch production values are absolutely stunning. The production design by Dennis Gassner is detailed and rich with atmosphere. Thomas Newman's score mixes John Barry's theme with Newman's own innovative music. The film editing by Stuart Baird is concise and edgy. Foremost is the sumptuous photography by the ever-talented Roger Deakins who creates such sweeping visual splendor in every scene, making Skyfall the kind of rousing big-budget entertainment needed to be seen on the big screen.These ten reasons are reason enough to see Skyfall. Granted, so far this has been a lackluster year for films, but it is not faint praise to say that this is one of the better movies of 2012 or any year. No doubt about it, Skyfall is a real crowd-pleaser that will make a windfall for the studio. It just might be the first Bond film to earn a Best Picture nod too.

Iron Man 3," Tin Man
","This film is mildly recommended.The simplistic genre of comic book action hero films usually fail to excite me. Yes, there have been exceptions to the rule: Marvel's The Avengers, The Amazing Spiderman, The Dark Knight quickly come to mind, as does the original Ironman. But in general for me, most comic book action fantasies are of the black and white variety: the good guys vs. crazed villains, plots to take over the world vs. plans to save it, the evildoer almost destroying our hero who makes a triumphant comeback, the CGI constantly overwhelming the real stunt work. Yes, the formula is set and hardly ever detours from its goal. Which brings us to the third installment of the Ironman franchise, which is more of the same one can expect from this genre, but also a rare commodity that adds some grayer tones to the story with its wry and cynical humor, its stronger character development, and a crowd- pleasing performance by its lead actor, Robert Downey, Jr. ￼The formulaic plot of Ironman 3 goes like this: Our flawed and egotistical playboy Tony Stark dons the Ironman suit once again to stop world domination (and for some personal revenge, or course). With the aid of his loyal friend, Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and his trusty girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), at his side, Stark fights evil in the form of The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a madman who regularly interrupts the airwaves threatening the annihilation of world order. Also on hand are a rich entrepreneur named Aldrich Killlian (well played by Guy Pearce) who must have an ulterior motive and Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, a scientist who must supply some more conflict. This leads to various action set pieces that tend to wow the audience and give that special adrenalin rush to today's movie-going audience. These action sequences vary in success due to the frenzied editing and too many close-ups that interfere with the action. (One exception is an especially thrilling segment involving an air rescue mission to save falling passengers that is beautifully staged.)￼Solidly directed by Shane Black, Ironman 3 essentially remains escapist pop entertainment. But with the world a-changing, reality is beginning to add a darker tone to the mayhem on the screen. The era of lively pop extravaganza is beginning to lose some of its color. Just how far can you escape from the horrors of terrorism, death, and violence these days, with the on-going epidemic of sadism and brutality we now witness on a daily basis? With so many images of 9/11, the Boston Marathon bombing, and ransom serial shootings plaguing our consciousness, can we now be immune to the real life senselessness of killing, even if this PG rated film sanitizes the gore by showing very little bloodshed? Can we allow ourselves to be so desensitized to the carnage in the form of entertainment for an hour or two? ￼The filmmakers seem to have taken too many liberties in updating the source and giving it a modern slant, profiling the enemy to be Middle Eastern. Black deliberately changes the ethnicity of the main villain from the original comic book source. (Perhaps the Chinese backers of the film objected.) This new Mandarin, much younger in the comic book version and without any superpowers in this film, has even aged to resemble Osama Ban Laden and this uncomfortable image plus the film's more serious point of view grounds the film in the real world. Granted the successful Ironman franchise has always had a realistic edge to its comic book trappings. But now reality has reared its ugly head. Explosions are a commonplace occurrence and destruction without consequence is everywhere in Ironman 3. (This film made me seriously question at what price do we pay for entertainment value nowadays.)That said, the film has some assets amid some missteps, from its fine production values and its inspired casting. Downey and Paltrow continue to have the right chemistry between them, even if the script by Drew Pearce and the director gets a bit wobbly at times. Transitions between the narrative exposition and the gung-ho warfare and gadgetry became tedious and dull. An unfortunate amount of time is spent with a cute tyke at the midway point that might appeal to the pre-teen set but slows down the film's momentum. Also, while Guy Pearce brings the perfect sense of deranged danger to his character, Kingsley makes some unusual choice with his vocal delivery which I found more off-putting than menacing. (He sometimes sounded like a high-pitched Walter Cronkite.) Ironman 3 is a well-made Hollywood blockbuster that totally engages its audience with some powerful images, strong acting, and even has a twist or two to convert any naysayers. ( The 'surprising' twists didn't surprise me at all.) Still, I personally needed more fantasy in my escapism, a further leap from the harsh reality of our world that this film was unable to give me. In retrospect, maybe the black and white extremes of past efforts are better than the grayer shades on view. I guess today's superheroes do have it even tougher after all. GRADE: B-",6,1,3,7 May 2013
It," As Horror Films Go, It Works Very Well
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: There are plenty of scares in this well-made predictable horror remake. SYNOPSIS: Children are mysteriously vanishing and a band of young sleuths battle an evil force named Pennywise.JIM'S REVIEW: Clowns get no respect. Once the target of laughs and the butt of jokes, they now are coming into their own as repressed sick murderers bent on revenge and mayhem. Their reputation is evolving and Andrew Muschietti's It will cement its new incarnation.The phrase, 'a penny wise and a pound foolish' might mean to be careful about unimportant things and careless about important matters, but the film adaptation of Stephen King's It is very smart to pay attention to the small details that build on the tension and phobias of many moviegoers and then lets the overall storytelling and plot create the horror. The film is also very clever to deal with its evil It, namely Pennywise, a sadistic killer clown and perfect villain vs. its Stand by Me coming of age innocent teenagers who come together to save the inhabitant of their New England town.Many years ago, Mr. King's successful novel was an even more successful 1990 television mini- series. Just as that version allowed strong character development and its intriguing plot to unfold in order to build suspense, so does this newer installment...plus it has the freedom to be more graphic in its violence, which has its built-in pluses and minuses depending on every moviegoer's taste. While the story still remains formulaic and the killings are a tad more bloody and gruesome (enough to earn a R-rating), the film sets out to do what It is meant to do: scare and satisfy its audience. (The screenplay by Chase Palmer. Gary Dauberman, and the film's previous director, Cary Fukunaga, follows the book fairly faithfully. Based on the original source, this film doesn't tell the whole story and only deals with the earlier lives of the adolescent crusaders before they reached adulthood...there is already a sequel about the novel's later chapter.)Director Muschietti skillfully makes this fright machine work and he paces his film with enough bumps in the night for audiences to relish this genre. Too often, he relies on too much CGI, an overabundance of quick cuts, or sudden loud noises to create the cheap thrills, but he also knows how to set up the action, generate the fear factor, establish the characters enough for the audience to invest in their deadly peril, and slowly build scenes of suspense to well earned horror. (My favorite moment: the slide projector sequence.)The plot may be redundant but it is serviceable. Children of the tiny village of Derry, Maine are disappearing with no end in sight. No one, especially the dysfunctional adults, are unable to solve the mysteries or unwilling to believe a group of teenagers who decide to investigate. The kids are a cross section of young misfits and loners that are more clichéd characters than real, but, let's face It, this 'Loser's Club' are mere plot devices to move the action along to the next creepy encounter.The young actors are fine in their roles, especially Sophia Lillis (a real find), Nicholas Hamilton, Jeremy Ray Taylor, and Jaeden Lieberher. They are all totally believable and give some nuance to their stock generalizations of childhood stereotypes.But to make this all flow, the evil villain needs to be menacing and terrifying. Pennywise's make- up, with its cracked white greasepaint, sharp rotten teeth, and elongated forehead, defines this monster so well. More ghoulish than clown-like, the effect is chilling. Special mention goes to the hair and make-up artisans for creating such a memorable creature and kudos to the man behind the painted mask, actor Bill Skaragard. It's all scary fun.NOTE: Nice poster design too.",8,3,9,9 September 2017
Hereditary," As the Graham Crackers Crumble
","GRADE: C+ THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite fine acting and direction, pretension undoes tension in this far-fetched and ultimately disappointing supernatural thriller.JIM'S REVIEW: Beware the artsy independent horror film! Usually adored by critics and well-crafted by its filmmakers, this genre begins intriguingly, builds its tension well, only to lose all reason by its third act. You have seen this all before, with movies like The Witch, It Follows, The Blair Witch Project, The Strangers, and mother!...all of the spooky parts that never make a rational whole. We now have to add writer / director Ari Aster's Hereditary to the mix. This is not to say that the movie is not impressive: it is very effective in its imagery and acting. But it just has such an unsatisfying and loopy ending which diminishes all the chills and thrills that come before.The story involves Annie Graham (Toni Collette), a visual artist who creates miniature environments with painstaking detailed accuracy. Her precision and skill, however, only seem apparent in her art. As a passionate mother and wife, she is far from perfect. Hereditary begins with the death of Annie's mother, also a fractured force in her unusual upbringing. We meet the other family members at the funeral: her stoic husband, Steve (Gabriel Bryne), her creepy introverted daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and her unloved drug-laden son Peter (Alex Wolff). From the start, everyone has abnormal tendencies. All exist within their own traumatic universe, with no one in authority questioning this family's unhealthy choices. Their behavior, to say the least, is relentlessly odd and overtly weird. Yes, there are bizarre dysfunctional families...and then there are The Grahams. When the film's central characters relish in their eccentricities and erratic ways, there is no norm in this new normal. Everything gets all the more curiouser and very bewildering.Where the film is its most effective is in its domestic family drama storyline, that is, before it veers into the supernatural realm. Strange and unexplainable things begin to happen and the filmmakers create the right tone for this horror film's initial set-up. This is Mr. Aster's directorial debut and it signals the making of a talented director. He fills the screen with surreal images (ants crawling on a severed head, black flies buzzing away in an attic, flames suddenly combusting for no reason, a child's rubber ball bouncing out of the shadows, etc.). The director also populates his story with engrossing characters and many pivotal dramatic scenes.(Kudos to cinematographer Pawel Pogorelski who captures the claustrophobic feel of Grace Yun's strong production design and he photographs the home with low angle shots to reinforce the eerie dollhouse theme with stark lighting and shadow for the necessary eerie haunted house effect.But the screenplay piles high its contrived plot devices and interesting twists that feed on circumstances which are illogical and never fully thought out. Complicating the build-up of incredulous happenings are inexplicable acts of violence that would trigger the immediate appearances of law enforcement, school, or medical authorities who never seem to intercede. As the film progresses, the moviegoer has to suspend belief to make sense of it all, and some of low budget CGI do not help matters. Just saying that there are supernatural forces at play does not justify the action of some characters and their whereabouts while their motives remain murky at best.The acting is top notch. Mr. Bryne and Ms. Shapiro are very fine in their roles but it is the conflict between mother and son that anchors the film. Mr. Wolff plays the troubled teen with aching despair. He plies his character with angst, guilt, and a tender quality of sadness. He is the emotional counterbalance to Ms. Collette's shrew mother figure. Partly deranged confessor, partly loving and cruel Mommie Dearest, the actress excels with an unparalleled emotional range. It is worthy of Oscar contention. Also giving yeomanlike support is the reliable Anne Dowd as Annie's new friend, Joanie, from her group therapy session.Hereditary is a powerful directing showcase for a new creative talent like Mr. Asher. His film may be disturbing and intense, but it is also pretentious and absurd due to his wonky script. Yes, there is more here that meets the eye, even if the mind is not fully convinced about all of those bumps in the night.",6,1,2,12 June 2018
Detroit," Law and Disorder
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: A- THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Kathryn Bigalow creates a searing docudrama about racial unrest in America.SYNOPSIS: The Detroit riots of 1967 serve as the backdrop for a vicious attack on some party-goers by some police officers.JIM'S REVIEW: We see it on the news...police officers being secretly photographed using excessive force to arrest a possible lawbreaker, or the opposite viewpoint, an average citizen choosing a violent act of aggression against the police force. It's seems to be an everyday occurrence in our 21st century. Hate speech and violent actions are rampant these days, and with that comes the issue of poverty, crime, and racism underscoring the rationale. 50 years ago, that same savage behavior happened sporadically, or at least, not to our knowledge in this age of social media. Intense, manipulative, and uncompromising in its vision of racial unrest in America, Kathryn Bigelow's film, Detroit, is a harrowing look into our nation's class divide.'Just as Ava's DuVernay's epic 2015 film, Selma, looked to the past to show our present, so does this equally fine film. Yes, there will be a backlash against the film's liberal bias, or its ugly view of police brutality, or the fact that a white female director has chosen to tell this tale. But those are smoke and mirrors deflecting the real message of the film. Its social conscience prevails, even if its story is told in black and white (or black vs. white), with little gray to be seen. Both films show that black lives rarely mattered during the turbulent sixties and not much has changed with law enforcement or the court system from then to now. And that is the most telling fact, sadly proving that history continues to repeat itself.A city is a microcosm of its inhabitants. Using the Detroit riots of 1967 as its backdrop, this docudrama incorporates real life characters and events to convey its human drama. As the film begins, it's summer in the city. Temperatures are hot with no relief in sight. The police raid an unlicensed bar and its patrons are being ridiculed and threatened. A rowdy crowd gathers to watch the proceedings and a mob scene erupts in violence. The riots begin and grow over three nights. National guard troops are called in to 'calm' the protesters. In Mark Boab's exceptional screenplay, we focus on a human drama that tragically plays out during one of those nights: In a small hotel room, some friends gather to party and forget about the turmoil that surrounds them. Stereotypes abound. The angry young Negro. The bigoted cop. The righteous African-American police officer being falsely accused (John Botega, being the heart and soul of the film). All are thrown into this melting pot called America and the hatred and prejudice boils over in the most unsettling of ways. A starter pistol goes off, bringing the police to the premises. Lead by a sadistic officer named Krauss (a menacing Will Poulter), the stage is now set for repeated acts of inhumanity and sadism.This hostage situation sequence, which becomes the riveting section of the film, includes scenes of psychological torture and brutal violence which go on for too long, making the film squirm-inducing and quite disturbing to watch. This confrontational scene is in-your-face cinema verite that engulfs the moviegoer to witness acts of cruelty that go unpunished. This is serious filmmaking about an all-too-serious subject, and the director never shies away from the events, although she does take some creative leeway with the facts to dramatize her narrative.Ms. Bigalow's direction is brilliant. She layers her narrative with such clarity and insight, establishing the incident and creating many memorable characters that are caught in the crossfire. She mixes newsreel footage with her reenactments of the crimes in such a subtle and forceful way. Production design by Jeremy Hindle, Barry Ackroyd's photography, and the editing by William Goldenberg and Harry Yoon captures these grim times vividly. The filmmakers create a realistic war zone and fill it with images that depict the conflict between racesThe film has one of the best ensembles of the year. Algee Green, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, and Anthony Mackie are terrific. Also providing excellent support are Hannah Murray, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, and Kaitlyn Dever. The aforementioned Mr. Botega and Mr. Poulter are outstanding in their roles and should be garner many well-earned accolades this award season.Detroit parallels a nation at war with itself, and though the message is often preachy and overstates its position too often, the overall impact is thought-provoking if disheartening. Ms. Bigalow's tale of law and disorder will upset and stun you, but it just might open up a needed discussion about the taboo subject of racism in America that is still infecting our country today...50 years later.",10,8,24,5 August 2017
Rocketman," Flying Slightly Above Most Musical Bios
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fine performance by Taron Egerton and some fancy direction elevates Rocketman from its tethered script.JIM'S REVIEW: I remember when rock was young...and a young singer named Reginald Dwight a.k.a. Elton John exploded on the music scene with hit after hit after hit. Rocketman, an exuberant film biography of this musical legend, plays those hits too, as the film strings together the soundtrack of his life with varying degrees of success. Due mostly to a sensational performance by Taron Egerton in the title role, the musical interludes are performed and viewed very imaginatively, even if the storytelling is strictly mundane.Lee Hall's screenplay follows the contrived formula usually found in most bio-pics by showing the highs and lows of Elton John's personal story and expansive career: a child prodigy, unloving parents, a doting grandma, a caring music partner, a destructive relationship with his first lover/ manager, the typical drugs, sex, and rock and roll, etc. The story goes from Point A to Point B in a very predictable manner. The supporting characters are stock figures with little development and the writing never brings any depth to their motives or backgrounds. It expects the songs to tell the story in a most obvious way.Still, what sets this tired old clichÃ© set-up apart from most bio-pics are the clever musical numbers that give the film a surreal and engaging quality. The songs are performed in no chronologic order. Instead they are the lead-ins and exposition to the many mercurial stages of the singer's life. This is strictly a juke box musical ala Mamma Mia, only much much better, with hints of The Who's Tommy thrown in at full throttle. The actors sing and dance their emotions through Mr. John's infectious music and Bernie Taupin's expressive lyrics, adding so much class to the film.And the whole concept mostly works.Yes, it's all too obvious and at times, overdone and excessive...but so is the man on stage. Director Dexter Fletcher knows how to stage his musical dream sequences and concert performances with the needed style and flourish. He also unflinchingly shows John's sexuality and does not sanitize these encounters as he did with the crowd-pleasing Freddy Mercury biography, Bohemian Rhapsody, which he previously co-directed. Special mention must also be paid to Julian Day's costumes which replicate John's iconic outfits with nostalgia and creative edginess.But it is Mr. Egerton, who does his own singing (a daring choice), and he captures the megastar's vocal intonations quite well. The actor delivers the emotional gravitas, especially in depicting Mr. John's abusive behavior. One hopes his performance will not be overlooked during award season. Jamie Bell plays John's writing partner, Bernie Taupin, and makes his character believable and real. As the villainous business manager / evil lover, Richard Madden tries to underplay this character with some degree of credibility, but the writing undoes his effort. Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh as Reginald's feuding mum and dad are wasted in their stereotypical roles.With an excellent lead performance by Mr. Egerton, Rocketman is always entertaining. Yet, while the film attains lift off, it just doesn't soar as high as it could.",8,2,3,6 June 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star is Born and Reborn and Reborn and Reborn
","GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: The ups-and-downs of a well-known love story, told with style, emotion, and mega-talent. JIM'S REVIEW: We all know the tale of Mrs. Norman Maine a.k.a. Esther Blodgett a.k.a. Vicki Lester, depending on your generation. Why you may even know Esther Hoffman and her drunken husband John Norman Howard, if you were a product of the 70's! Now meet Ally and Jackson Maine.On stage, Jackson Maine is a still commanding presence with a loyal fanbase. Off stage, he is a mess. Alone, going deaf, reeling from too much drinking, the man is on the decline, not yet realizing his career is over. And then he meets his one true love, Ally, possibly his saving grace, in the fifth remake of this classic love story, namely A Star is Born. (That is, if you also count the original 1932 film, What Price Hollywood in the list of former remakes).Directed and starring Bradley Cooper, this version delves into the music business with a honest and tell-all approach. He plays Jack, an country western big-time performer who is also an alcoholic losing his hearing and falling to pieces behind the scenes. One day he meets and becomes smitten with an unknown talent, Ally (Lady Gaga), who will become his love interest as she begins to achieve success. Unfortunately their trajectories to fame and fortune never quite match up. Hence, the conflicts of a love affair that ebbs and wanes. Moviegoers, get ready for some high class melodrama and bring your tissues!What makes this version work so well is the teaming of the leads, a literate screenplay by Eric Roth, Will Fetters, and Mr. Cooper, a strong musical score that is mostly written by Lady Gaga, sensitive direction, and top notch production values. The film captures the initial stages of first love so effectively, that wondrous feeling of attraction when two people find their lasting soulmate. In the film's early scenes, watch Mr. Cooper's acting and Lady Gaga's reactions. Nothing is said, everything is understood. When they team together to sing, as in a lovely original song entitled Shallow, their give-and-take euphoria is undeniable. Their shared chemistry together is palpable and serves as the core of the film. They are simply superb and deserving of award recognition. The screenplay keeps the central plot moving, even if some supporting characters are underwritten. Solid work comes from Andrew Dice Clay, unrecognizable as Ally's father, David Chappelle as Jack's friend, Rafi Gavron as Ally's calculating business manager, and an excellent Sam Elliott as Jack's frustrated older brother, Bobby.Mr. Cooper undercuts some of the film's impact with some of his directorial touches (especially in the film's dramatic climax), but overall, he mostly avoids the schmaltz and sentimentality of this predictable story (not always, though) and focuses on the realism of the cut-throat music business and its formulaic marketing of a singing idol. He also powerfully stresses the problem of alcoholism as a viable issue that dooms their relationship. Music plays an important part in the film and the musical score, a mix of original tunes and covers, is quite strong, especially the aforementioned tune and the film's closing number, I Will Never Love Again, beautifully performed. No, it is not an iconic cinematic musical moment, like Garland's The Man That Got Away scene in the 1953 version, but modern audience can wholeheartedly relate to this ballad and Lady Gaga's thrilling vocal histrionics in the film's fade-out.The believability factor is needed to make a love story resonate and both Mr. Cooper and his Lady make the film so emotionally engaging an, without a doubt, moving. They are memorable and the chief reasons to see this fine remake of A Star is Born.",9,2,3,16 October 2018
Gravity," One Helluva Ride Indeed
","This film is highly recommended.My review: Tag lines are a funny thing. Created by clever ad men, they lure the unexpected masses to their product with a few carefully chosen words that are usually misleading. Only on rare occasions are they ever accurate, especially in the hyperbole of the science fiction film genre. However some slogans do ring true. Stanley Kubrick's masterwork, 2001: A Space Odyssey, used 'The Ultimate Trip' as its come-on. Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi thriller, Alien, had this tag line: 'In space, no one can hear you scream.' In Alfonso Cuarón's exhilarating new film, Gravity, the catchphrase is just a three word message: 'Don't Let Go'. This film doesn't and for 90 gripping and tension-filled minutes, it takes us on a metaphysical journey in space where no one can hear you, except Mission Control in Houston. And this ultimate and dangerous trip is all the more frightening because of the dire lifelike isolation of a person set adrift and totally alone.Gravity is grounded in realism. There are no extraterrestrial creatures or mystical interventions to contend with. The simplistic story is essentially a battle of survival concerning the sudden dangers of exploration and its daring space travelers caught in its stratosphere. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a first-time traveler and medical engineer and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is a wise-cracking veteran astronaut. Both are on a mission to repair parts of the satellite. While on a spacewalk, high speed debris destroys their spacecraft leaving them lost in space. (This event happens almost immediately once the film begins with an amazing opening tracking sequence of visual mastery that is absolutely breathtaking to behold. See it in 3-D IMAX for full effect.)Alfonso Cuarón has been a strong director in his past efforts (Y Tu Mamá También, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men), but this film may be his masterpiece. His unique vision of outer space is haunting and poignant, rivaling Kubrick's earlier film. (Of course, technical advances have improved since the late 60's.) Cuarón stresses a sense of dread and foreboding doom throughout the film which weighs heavily on the characters and the movie-going audience. His highly effective camera-work and compositions create powerful imagery that are unlike anything seen before it. His point of view and use of perspective, sometimes seen from inside the space helmet or in the claustrophobic space chambers, ratchets up the suspense. Cuarón also co-edited and co-wrote the film's script with Mark Sanger and his son, Jonás Cuarón, respectively. It's a concise and straightforward tale about tragic miscalculations and man's instinct for survival, although there are some plot contrivances at the journey's end.The film swings from scenes of infinite beauty, using darkness and light and silence and sound which maximizes the tension. Images of remarkable grandeur continually fill the screen. The use of stylized movement and floating objects create an eerie and poetic impression from sudden tears suspended in mid air to a space traveler afloat striking an embryonic pose. (Kudos to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki for his stunning camera-work and to Steven Price's lively musical score, both of which contributed to the film's overall impact.) While the technical aspects of the film are all top-notch, the film is essentially a standard and rather conventional two character drama. Creating that necessary emotional connection with the audience are Bullock and Clooney who are more than up to the task. Bullock projects the inner fear and strength needed for such a physically demanding role. Clooney uses his macho bravado and leading man charisma to great effect, masking the more sensitive and protective aspects beneath his character's surface. Gravity deals directly with the issue of survival, of solitary confinement within our vast macro-cosmic universe. It is an epic film with stunning visual effects, masterful direction, and superb acting. This riveting film is a thoroughly intriguing and memorable movie-going experience and one of the best films of the year. At one point in the film, an astronaut says about this space adventure, 'It's one helluva ride!' Gravity surely is that and more.

Wind River," A Wintry Mix of Silence and Sorrow
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Taylor Sheridan's riveting murder mystery is a well written thriller that boasts a terrific performance by Mr. Renner.SYNOPSIS: On a remote Indian reservation, a FBI recruit and a local townsman team up to solve the murder.JIM'S REVIEW: The riveting opening scene in Taylor Sheridan's Wind River, immediately draws us into this thriller: At a Native American reservation, a bloodied young woman trudges through the sub-zero elements in central Wyoming, finally collapses, and dies. Barefoot and frightened, her wintry death sets up a murder mystery. Her frozen body is found by the town's wildlife officer / hunter, Corey Lambert (Jeremy Renner). Leading the investigation is FBI agent Jane Benner (Elizabeth Olsen). A newbie with the bureau, she wisely knows that in order to solve this case, she needs local help. So she enlists the aid of Corey, who knows the town and its people, although he is a bit of a loner with very little social skills and a tragic past. The duo set out to find their suspects and bring closure for their victim and her family.￼Screenwriter Mr. Sheridan (Hell or High Water, Sicario) once again tells his story with skill and style. He focuses on the murder investigation while subtly showing the socioeconomic hardships of the community and its toll on the citizenry. The town is filled with desperation and loss and its inhabitants are all prime suspects in search of redemption. This talented screenwriter, making his fine directorial debut, delivers an engrossing narrative and imbues his characters with insightful dialog that keeps his film riveting from start to finish. His film is atmospheric and moody and his characters have an authenticity that is usually lacking in this genre. ￼The one issue that I had with the film, which keeps it from being highly recommended, is the mystery itself. The story-line remains involving but it is just too simplistic, needing more intricate plot structure to completely satisfy. When we finally meet the perpetrators, everything appears far too obvious. That said, the screenplay still resonates with its complex characters and their impassioned monologues and eloquent conversations that create lovely moments about the human condition. The acting is uniformly strong. Graham Greene as Ben, a Native police officer, provides his customary able support and Gil Birmingham as the victim's father is quite moving. (The scenes between the two grieving fathers are very poignant and emphasize the personal drama most effectively.) Kelsey Asbille and Jon Bernthal make a lasting impression as the film's doomed lovers. Ms. Olsen is fine as the FBI agent, although her character's naivety and lack of training seems bewildering at times, which cuts into the logistic of the story. ￼However, Mr. Renner is a revelation. He underplays his character's angst and subtly shows his sense of mourning. He internalizes the man's melancholy and regret. His is a powerful performance and one wishes this gifted actor would be offered more complex roles than his typical shoot-em-up action fare and playing one-dimensional comic book superheroes.Wind River has its scenes of action and sudden violence in its storytelling that will please the action aficionados in the audience. Yet the film's greatest asset and driving force is not so much the mystery or its action sequences. It is the film's deeply personal human story that slowly unfolds. That, and Mr. Renner's memorable character and Mr. Sheridan's poetic words of wisdom make this movie-going experience quite special.",8,3,8,19 August 2017
Fury," War is Hell
","This film is highly recommended.Fury is a violent indictment of war and its many casualties. But perhaps, the subtitle should more accurately read: Fury: The Story of a Tank and the Boys who Loved It, since it plays up the band of brothers angle rather vigorously. Or, Fury: The Power and the Gory, since the bloodletting is extremely up close and personal. Either way, the film is a powerful and disturbing drama that evolves into a standard but riveting World War II tale of courage literally under fire. Anyone who has experienced a war film has seen this misfit group before. The stereotypes run deep here as does the clichés they continually lobbed at each other, like word grenades that blow up in their faces: 'Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.' There's the innocent newbie, Norman (Logan Lerman), the Bible-spouting religious zealot, Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf), the brutish bully, Grady (Jon Bernthal), the Latino, Gordo (Michael Pena) and their foolhardy and hardened leader, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt). All of these stock characters are assembled in the confines of a claustrophobic tin can nicknamed Fury. Their mission: stand their ground against the Nazis.For over two hours, the onslaught of Fury is endless, with little character development or back-story to add the slightest bit of enlightenment or empathy. The characters remain under-written facsimiles of the real thing. That said, the ensemble of actors do an exceptional job in trying to flesh out their sketchy characters, especially Shia La Beouf who brings some remarkably subtle acting to his character. However, Pitt's screen persona works against him at the start, seeming too similar to his crazed blood-thirsty character from Inglorious Basterds, a factor that throws the film off kilter at times. But as the film progresses, the actor displays more acting skills, adding a more human side to his tough-as-nails macho man and making his gonzo character more distinctive and believable.Writer/director David Ayer is quite talented, but he is far more interested in war action and its resulting carnage than the human story of its men. The film may accurately depict the brutality of war and the unquestionable bravery of the soldiers placed in these hellish situations, but the movie-going experience is equally as hellish as the war it depicts. While watching Fury, one can easily get battle fatigue from the warfare overkill. With its gruesome images of bloody flesh, exploding heads, and severed human limbs, Fury is not for the faint- hearted or those with a low tolerance for violence. In fact, Fury is violence personified to the max.Ayer has made a grim testament to these men. His visuals are impressive and have an overly realistic edginess, aided greatly by the cinematography by Roman Vasyanov and concise editing by Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn. Many scenes are beautifully composed and the action sequences are taut and intense. Yet the overall effect appears too manipulative and predictable, even if it is emotionally engaging. The extremely well staged battle scenes resonate the necessary visceral impact that other classic war films like Saving Private Ryan, The Bridge Over the River Kwai, and Platoon have delivered in the past. All in all, Fury is an ugly film, but that statement is meant to be more positive than negative. It unflinchingly shows off the atrocities of war faced by these characters in grisly details. It just doesn't show off its characters with enough details. Still, Fury remains a strong addition to its war genre faction.

Darkest Hour," No Small Talk Here
","GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A solid performance by Gary Oldman makes this talky but always engrossing bio-pic work.SYNOPSIS: The first month of Winston Churchill's leadership as Prime Minister.JIM'S REVIEW: The filmed biography is an odd lot. It begins at a disadvantage from the start. Whereas a biographical novel can leisurely tell its tale with highly detailed research that spans a lifetime, the movie version usually is conventional storytelling with condensed timelines and hastily constructed dramatic flourishes, blurring facts and fiction and purporting to be true. Labeled as 'based on a true story' is oft times misleading. Such is the case of Joe Wright's Darkest Hour, a well crafted and earnest attempt to tell the political beginnings of World War II and the early career of Sir Winston Churchill, as England's Prime Minister.An unrecognizable Gary Oldman plays an unrecognizable Churchill. (Much has been said about the astonishing resemblance of the actor to this great man. But he barely resembles the Prime Minister, no matter what others may say. Make-up and prosthetics never fully capture the likeness of the man, although they come very close at times. But the actor certainly captures the mannerisms, voice, stance, and temperament of this crusader. It's a virtuoso performance that one can easily admire.The film delves into the first month of Churchill's career as he tries to convince Parliament and his nation of the rise of Hitler and the risk of losing his beloved country to the Nazi movement. War is the only outcome in his mind and uniting his country against these forces is an uphill battle. Andrew McCarten plays fast and loose with the facts, but follows the basic outline of historical events. (Case in point: A mawkish ride on the Underground overplays the nationalistic fervor and seems very stilted and untrue, even if this scene makes its political argument and justification of the pending war.) Darkest Hour is rather talky and overtly dogmatic, with various impassioned speeches about survival and courage, amid all of the political intrigue and one-upmanship.Mr. Wright's direction remains solid, although he again relies too heavily on slo-motion techniques, long tracking shots, and never-ending aerial photography, his trademark signatures, which becomes a bit tiresome. However, he assembles a fine cast that take these stock characters and breathes life into their stereotypical roles.Kristin Scott Thomas masterfully plays his loyal wife, Clemmie, and she delivers an aristocratic elegance as his devoted spouse. Lily James is his supportive secretary, an embodiment of the English middle class and sounding board to Churchill's mood swings. Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup are just fine as his adversaries, Viscount Halifax and former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Ben Mendelsohn, as King George VI, brings the perfect degree of trepidation and concern, always questioning the unpleasantry and motives of another equally powerful man who ruled England with him.But it is Mr. Oldman who centers the film in this showiest of role. Without his whole-hearted interpretation of a man defending his unpopular position as a war hawk during a time when the world prayed for peace, the movie could not have achieve its overall impact. Darkest Hour is a seriously minded film that contemplates the beginnings of World War II and the man who took his nation to victory.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,0,3,24 December 2017
Captain Marvel," Captain Yadda...Yadda...Yadda
","GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A minor superhero movie with minor results.JIM'S REVIEW: First, let me hereby state that I am not a comic book hero aficionado. This blockbuster fantasy genre is not the least bit endearing to me. My knowledge base is extremely limited as well. So I had some slight confusion with the new updating version of Captain Marvel's image. I asked myself, 'Just when did captain Marvel go through transgender re-alignment?' Shazam, I remember this superhero being a muscular vision of masculinity back in the fifties. Now, he is a she! Upon further research, I discovered that this superhero he-man carried the same monicker as this new cinematic version. It appears that the one superhero that I knew in childhood came from an alternate universe, namely DC Comics. The other appeared later in the seventies when its rival company, Marvel Comics, introduced a woman empowerment heroine, also named Captain Marvel, a.k.a. Carol Danvers. This is her story. Soon to be a franchise. No snip, snip here, unless you count this film's frenzied editing.This new movie, Marvel's Captain Marvel, plops her into a time warp somewhere in the middle of the nineties. Complete with clunky computers that take forever to boot, Blockbuster Video tapes, brightly-lit pinball machines, troll dolls, and a catchy rock score, we meet our superwoman, a poor man's version of Wonder Woman. Brie Larson plays her without the wonder. The actress has a likable personality and fits nicely into her form-fitting latex uniform as she battles evil. That is all she is asked to do...look intense, kick ass, and be attractive. The side effect of all this dare-doing is that our heroine seems to be suffering from memory lapses that haunt her. Throughout most of the film, she tries to piece together these moments unsuccessfully, just like the screenwriters.The story is a real muddle, adding some twists to its anemic plot while providing small morsels to the Marvel mythology to please its fanbase. Other familiar supporting characters from other series are present such Nick Fury as her sidekick, played once again by Samuel L. Jackson, and an introduced-but-quickly-forgotten walk-on appearance by Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson of the Avengers fame. It all make no real sense but, at least, the screenwriting team of Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and her co-writers and the film's directors, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, tried to rally and provide some details to their failing narrative.Everything follows the same safe formula of other Marvel films: a superhero trying to harness her powers and find her inner self, bad guys are there to stand in her way, too many chase sequences and blurry battle action occupy most of the screen time, more overkill of CGI upstaging the actors, the expected Stan Lee cameo, an uplifting finale...yadda... yadda...yadda. Same old, same old. And it is a total bore...plus a waste of time for moviegoers and all of the actors involved.The direction of this dud is sub-standard, but I credit the directors with assembling a cast of talented actors like Jude Law, Annette Bening, Djimon Hiunsou, Lee Pace, and Ben Mendelsohn, even if they are given little to do other than strut in slow motion whenever they walk, over emote, or shoot lightning bolts at one another and bounce off walls. So much for depth of character. The action scenes are poorly staged and filmed. Special effects are far from special. There is zero chemistry between Ms. Larson and Mr. Jackson. Their dialog and unfunny banter lacks any modicum of wit or charm, so this time I free these fine actors from blame due to their strong resume of prior work. (Note to filmmakers: When any pet, in this case an orange cat, steals the show, something is amiss.As entertainment goes, Captain Marvel is middle-of-the-road fare. Little girls may relate to a female superhero and buy into this action figure and teenage boys may lust after Ms. Larson, but the character still remains a minor superhero in comparison. On the big screen, Captain Marvel delivers no excitement and has very little to...well, Marvel. Yadda...yadda...yadda.",4,15,28,11 March 2019
This Is the End," Lewd and Crude, Butt Funny
","This film is recommended. Take a group of today's younger comedians and actors, mix in an apocalyptic nightmare scenario, and add plenty of raunchiness and sexual hi-jinks and you have a film like This is The End. Brought to you from the same team that produced Superbad and Pineapple Express, two films that left me underwhelmed, This is The End tries so hard to raise the level of shock value and tastelessness and although the film completely loses sight of the bigger picture, it has an abundance of laughs amid all the lewdness. This is The End wants to create genuine laughs at the expense of the next Hollywood Brat Pack with a better-them-than-us mentality. It wisely trades on their likability factor and the public's general perception of these performers from their previous films. The actors play themselves, real-life best friends caught in the aftershock of the turbulence surrounding them, as the world as they know it, spins out of control. There's a party at James Franco's home and Seth Rogen Jonah Hill, and Craig Robinson are just some of the invited guests, along with Jay Baruchel. As more party-goers arrive, so does the Rapture. Other party-goers turned survivalists include: Danny McBride, Emma Watson, and Michael Cera, who is hilarious as he plays against his own geeky type . There are also many surprising cameos from other celebrities with mixed results and funny visual riffs of other films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and even Ghostbusters. One by one, the actors send up their own screen personas. (Franco, Rogen, and Hill fare best.)The cleverness of this conceit adds some humor and it is that camaraderie that helps to make the film succeed up to a point. The inside jokes and banter skews their stereotypical public images as stoners, doofuses, and nerds are thrown from one catastrophe to the next. Where the film begins to falter is in its execution. The film downplays their dire situation at the expense of its own plot structure. While laughs are frequent and the childish antics remain character-driven, the story itself begins to ramble. The ramping up of sex and violence (quite graphic at times) tends to upend the well-earned comedic elements.Written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the film entertains while it perverts the notion of celebrity worship, ethical dilemmas, religious dogma, and the lack of moral conscience and one-upsmanship in today's self-serving society. That's a lot to digest from a film which is really a basic teen comedy in disguise. Still, the film's biggest asset is its savage wit in pushing the satirical elements to exaggerated proportions. Unfortunately, the film never knows when to say when. It continually overdoes its grossness and vulgarity and becomes a bit exhausting with all its excesses on full display, leading to a rather silly ending after all the hoopla.This is The End is a series of endless outrageous pranks that may shock and appall some moviegoers while thoroughly delight others. Audience reaction will run the gamut depending on your own comfort level of irreverent humor. As for me, I enjoyed much of the fun, the crude humor, and even the offensive jokes of This is The End.

World War Z," Fast, Furious, and Infected
","This film is recommended.Things have certainly changed in our fast-paced world. Our need for speed has become insatiable. Never is it more apparent than in the zombie genre. The dead are no longer walking. Today's zombies have been redesigned for maximum efficiency. Danny Boyle's ground-breaking 2003 horror classic, 28 Days Later energized that genre, and so does this skillfully-made offering entitled World War Z, the latest apocalyptic cautionary tale in a long line of disaster-oriented movies this summer. (This year's primary theme has showcased the bleakest possible view of our future and paraded those films before us with very mixed results.)In WWZ, the scenario takes a global look at the zombie fever as we hopscotch to various locations (Philadelphia, Jerusalem, Korea, Wales). The virus cannot be contained and we are almost immediately classified in Code Red epidemic level. The film is Contagion revisited as a horror genre exercise in terror. Gone are the slow-moving brain munchers, monsters one could outwit and out-walk in the past. This newer model is fully equipped with a metaphysical souped-up V-6 engine and can travel at breakneck speed, literally speaking. These undead are the new fast and furious with a 'yum,yum eat 'em up' attitude.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a United Nations investigator who is trying to find a cure to stop this pandemic. But first he must somehow manage to get his own family out of harm's way before confronting the problem head-on. Throughout the film, Gerry is put in action hero mode, having to be brave and resourceful as he faces off against the attacking hordes in an effort to discover the virus' origin and stop this epidemic. The reasons why Gerry is the world's only savior and foremost zombie exterminator remain unclear, but it is Brad Pitt after all. Who else can save the world when Tom Hanks isn't available?Meanwhile, the zombies swarm, multiply, and destroy what is left of human mankind, like crazed Walmart shoppers on a typical Black Friday rush (and just as terrifying). Director Marc Forster seems more concerned about CGI effects and creating horrific tension. He sets up one action sequence after the next to insure full audience interest and stages those set pieces quite effectively. (Particularly memorable are the siege at the fortress sequence and an in- flight zombie encounter that is edited for maximum tension and a scene involving ) The gore factor is surprisingly low by today's standards, which might disappoint some hard-core horror aficionados, but I applaud the filmmaker's restraint. WWZ is a fast moving and suspenseful diversion. Production values are all first-rate with special kudos to the sound effects editing team and Marco Beltrami's seamless musical score. However, the film spends hardly any time on character development or much narrative. Pitt carries off his role well, within the limits of the script that is more invested in pumping up the adrenaline rush than emphasizing the personal dramas and dilemmas of its characters. The talented Mirelle Enos as his wife, Karin, is not given enough screen time to help build more emotional impact as are many secondary characters who tend to be dispatched the moment they arrive on the scene. (Was that Matthew Fox who delivered one line of throwaway dialog or was my vision impaired?)But World War Z is essentially an action/horror movie that delivers much of its thrills and excitement due to Forster's vision as a director and the film's strong visual imagery. Seeing this film on the big screen will only enhance the movie-going experience. And if the world's gotta end, well, at least Brad Pitt is there for good company.

Passengers," Less Than Stellar
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An entertaining but superficial love story set in space.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Two space travelers are accidentally awakened on their journey to the stars.JIM'S REVIEW: Love is in the air (or possibly in the stratosphere) on an intergalactic mission to another world in Morten Tyldum's space romance fantasy, Passengers. Aboard the spaceship Avalon are our space travelers (and their other 498 passengers). Chris Pratt's Jim Preston is a mechanical engineer and also the space prince to his sleeping princess, Aurora Lane, a journalist played by Jennifer Lawrence. It does sound like a post-modern day Disney fairy tale, but that's about as far as it goes. ￼On a 120 year mission to colonize another planet and start life anew. Jim is unexpectedly awakened from his hibernation pod 90 years too soon and must now come to terms with his own survival and that of all of his fellow passengers. Trouble arises as the spaceship begins to malfunction and his need for companionship and assistance is handled by his waking female partner. Their attraction builds slowly but it is inevitable...and highly predictable as the film follows its basic boy-meet-girl-in-space formula. Besides, it's nice company having Mr. Pratt and Ms. Lawrence cast as the misfit lovers is a no-brainer, isn't it?The lead actors have the prerequisite amount of charm and attractiveness to carry the film. They bring authenticity to the roles while also oozing the necessary sex appeal. It is their relationship that is the core of the movie and both actors share the right chemistry. The small cast also includes the scene-stealing Michael Sheen as their faithful bartender and sounding board, Arthur, and Laurence Fishburne as Gus, an officer from the crew.￼The production design by Guy Hendrix Dyas and CGI effects by Erik Nordby and his talented artisans are quite impressive. Visually, the film is stunning, even if script-wise, it all seems like an outer space soap opera dressed to the nines. The screenplay by Jon Spaihts does try to stray from the conventional aspects of a love story, but doesn't always succeed due to a central moral dilemma set-up that complicates our lovers' relationship. That aspect never resolves itself clearly. Still, Mr. Tyldum keeps the action moving and the melodramatics at a minimum, that is, until the climactic third act when the plot and action become so far-fetched and strain credibility.The film does carry some excess baggage in its desperate yearning to keep its romantic story-line afloat, and although Rodrigo Prieto's photography does have a graceful hypnotic fluidity with its rolling camera angles, Passengers is still a rather bumpy ride.",8,1,3,7 January 2017
The Hunger Games," Dinner is Served
","This film is recommended.Our latest mega-blockbuster franchise was inspired from a 1987 sci-fi- film called The Running Man starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, loosely based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, which was inspired from Richard Connell's famous short story, The Most Dangerous Game, way back in 1924. Add in elements from The Wizard of Oz, The Truman Show, teen lit champ Twilight, and another classic American short story, Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, and you have The Hunger Games. No, there's no much originality left in Hollywood nowadays, but the money will be flying into the hands of the producers with this movie series. Hollywood still knows how to market and make an expensive film even more profitable and popular before its first screening. Money has been lavished on this big screen adaptation from Suzanne Collins best-selling trilogy, from its strong production crew to its fine casting. ( The author even helped to co- wrote the script, along with Billy Ray, and the director of the film, Gary Ross, giving it her seal of approval. ) The Hunger Games stars young up-and-coming talents who have proved their mettle in other movies: Jennifer Lawrence as the strong-willed heroine Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, her comrade-in-arms, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. her best friend and confidant. Also bringing a modicum of class to this project, in showier supporting roles, are a perfectly smarmy Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman), Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket), Wes Bentley (Seneca Crane), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch Abernathy) at his cynical best, and an underused Toby Jones (Claudius Templesmith).The simplistic story goes somewhat like this: It is the future. And, as we all know from past films of this genre, it's bleak. Global change is evident with drought, famine, and war the main causes. North America, now known as Panem, is made up of 12 districts where the 99% exist, and the Capitol, where the wealthy 1% live. Every year, there is a lottery where 24 teenagers from all the poorer districts, in teams of 2, are chosen to become part of a live reality game show like Survivor, only this time, it's real survival. One by one, these 'tributes' are eliminated until the champion is crowned. It's Gladiator games with mandatory viewing, televised for all the citizens of Panem ( and us ) to see. What makes The Hunger Game fun to watch is that it successfully captures the satirical edge of present-day America's obscene fascination with reality shows and competitions, blending its sci-fi mentality and teenage romance angst with a relevant social message of our insatiable 'hunger' for popular entertainment at all costs. Sure. it's an easy target to ridicule, but it works in an uncomplicated way.The story itself is pure action and only works on a visceral level. There is no true dramatic tug, no genuine emotion invested in the characters. Most of the teenage characters in peril do not resemble anything remotely real. They never go beyond the limitation of their stereotypical roles as pawns in the game of life vs. death ( the bloodthirsty jock, the mean girl, the innocent young waif, etc. ). Katniss, our noble protagonist, is portrayed as a young girl victimized by a cruel totalitarian society who sacrifices her own life to save her younger sister who was the actual Chosen One. She has all the heroic traits necessary to succeed: she's pretty and courageous, smart and strong-minded, agile and able to shoot a mean bow and arrow. Plus, she only kills in self- defense. A born leader and ultimate fighter, she's at the top at the food chain and the perfect role model for the tween set. Jennifer Lawrence shows the many sides of Katniss, all of her the spunk and savviness, and also subtly displaying her vulnerability and fear. Her casting is pivotal to the film's success in making Katniss such a sympathetic and likable character. Just as the tributes are manipulated by outside political forces, so is the movie audience controlled by its filmmakers. They have created a fine, if somewhat conventional, adaptation from an immensely popular novel. ( Loyal readers will not be disappointed in this version. ) Violence and gore are kept to a minimum to safeguard and assure that this PG-13 rated film reaches its targeted audience and the film is efficiently directed by Ross, although I wish he would have spent the extra $50 fora sturdy tripod to compensate for the overwrought shaky hand-held camera-work. The Hunger Games is diverting entertainment, a well-made film for assorted tastes, with enough satisfaction provided for mass consumption.

Zootopia," A Menagerie of Imaginative Delights
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A delightfully zany animated jaunt through the detective genre with our four-legged animal friends.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: In this world, all animals coexist in perfect harmony and take on stereotypical human traits. This animated buddy cop film introduces an idealistic rookie bunny teaming up with a cynical fox to investigate a series of attacks.JIM'S REVIEW: The evils of prejudice and the need for diversity are the underlying themes in Disney's Zootopia. We view a pastel-colored utopia sans humans where animals are '10% predator, 90% prey'. That is until some violence upsets the natural order of things. Which brings Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) together to solve this whodunit.The film spoofs film noir, detective stories, The Godfather, Breaking Bad, cop films, and other pop references as the duo go about following leads while not-too-subtly handling the message of tolerance and equality. The puns are plentiful in Jared Bush and Phil Johnson's funny screenplay which contrasts this crazy metropolis with our real world. The script uses animal profiling to the nth degree in a most seductive and insightful way which brings about much of the comedy elements.A committee of directors are credited with this film (Bryon Howard, Rich Moore, and, once again, Mr. Bush), so their individual contributions are not readily known, but their end result is seamlessly blended to create a wonderful children's film that seems more skewed for the adults in the audience. The animation is highly detailed and beautifully rendered, creating a satirical universe. The visuals work in unison with a strong narrative, so rare in today's animation which usually panders to sophomoric humor and bad story-telling. Although the filmmakers lay their overly positive message on too thickly and their politics is biased to the obvious liberal left (of which, I firmly concur), this does not interfere with one's full enjoyment of the film's overall wholesomeness and 'kumbaya' positive vibe.Ms. Goodwin and Mr. Bateman bring such joy and credibility to their characters. Providing expert voice-overs as well are Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong (superb as a holistic yak named Yax), Nate Torrance, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Shakira, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Raymond S. Persi as Flash, the slowest sloth clerk at the Department of Motor Vehicles, whose short (and long) bit is the film's laugh-out-loud highlight.Zootopia is the type of film whose main purpose to to entertain and amuse. Yet, it doesn't shy away from some serious issues. This animated film is not afraid to talk about the elephant in the room, even when there is an actual pachyderm in close proximity, which makes it all the more charming and memorable family fare.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9,10,21,7 March 2016
The Impossible," An Improbable Truth
","This film is recommended.The Impossible could have easily been retitled The Improbable with all the changes that director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez stuffed into their disaster drama, foremost being the nationality of the real Spanish family becoming Anglo-Saxon embodiment of Naomi Watt and Ewan McGregor in the lead roles of Maria and Enrique Belón a.k.a. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett in the film. The Impossible tells of their harrowing survival during their 2004 Christmas holiday at a tropical resort in Thailand when they became victims during a devastating tsunami that killed and injured over 200,000 people.The film almost immediately begins with its realistic depiction of these horrific events. The CGI sequence of the tsunami is frightening in its power and effectively chilling, even more skillfully done than in Clint Eastwood's film, Hereafter. ( It really deserved to be an Oscar contender in that category, yet it was inexplicably overlooked. )After that disturbing sequence, the film settles in for scenes of destruction and suffering, as seen through the eyes of the Bennett family members. Images of the dead or dying, the wreckage of property and human lives, everything surrounding them...in turmoil. With each new day comes an insurmountable obstacle, a sense of hopelessness and further despair. Whenever the film stays with those hardships and keeps its realistic edge, the film excels in its unflinching point of view. Where the film comes a bit undone is in its eagerness to overstate its uplifting and life- affirming message. There are some fine moments of genuine drama in The Impossible before it becomes awash with needless melodramatic lapses and enough sentimentality to get those tear ducts flowing in overdrive, not only for the film's actors, but more so, for every movie-going audience members.Perhaps the film's finest asset is the exemplary acting by Naomi Watts and newcomer Tom Holland who plays Lucas, the oldest son. Their unique emotional bond as mother and child is convincingly natural. Both actors seem to convey the courage and stamina that was needed for the real-life tragedy and encompass the human spirit and compassion that prevailed over difficult and grueling times. ( which probably could include the endless submerged filming and physical demands of their roles in this movie ). Also strong in a supporting role is McGregor. With less screen time, he efficiently captures the sense of loss and frustration as he tries to piece together his family. All in all, the acting in this film is outstanding in so many subtle ways and helps to make the film even more compelling.But ultimately, The Impossible seems to suffer more from a lack of conviction by its filmmakers in telling the so-called true story. They have undoubtedly created a well-made film. Yet they can't resist the urge to embellish the real events. Rather than believe in the essential truth in this tale of survival, Bayona and Sanchez play fast and loose with the facts. ( Yet another example: The real survivor lost half of her leg, but obviously the filmmakers thought that aspect is a tad too depressing for today's moviegoers. Instead, more family hugs and tearful embraces will suffice. ) After all, who needs the truth when half of that will get you that false feeling of hope and happiness, plus maybe a little more profit at the box office! Oh, if only the filmmakers had as much courage as their real-life inspiration. Then, and only then, would The Impossible have truly become The Impressive.

Argo," Mission Controlled
","This film is highly recommended.Does history ever really change or just re-invent itself? It's November 4, 1979. The American embassy has been under attack by extremist groups. Six Americans are in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis. They have temporarily escaped their captors and are being hidden in the Canadian embassy nearby. Time is running out before they are found. The American government is trying to remedy this volatile situation as fast as it can. ( Sadly, the ordeal would last 444 days after a failed attempt to save the other 52 hostages. )Tony Mendez, one of the many C.I.A. officers on duty, devises a hare-brained rescue plan to help them escape: create a bogus movie, go into Iran as one of the film's producers, and leave Iran with the missing hostages in tow, posing as his Canadian film crew. It sounds completely over-the-top, but the plan is set in motion, all under the guise of working on a sci-fi movie called Argo. The truth is usually stranger than fiction, and in the real action thriller called Argo, solidly directed by Ben Affleck ( and based on declassified information ), this event did actually happen ( with a bit of real Hollywood tweaking in both scenarios).The film begins with a mini-lesson about the history of the weakening U.S.-Iran relations via storyboard form before going to live action footage of the typical but topical angry mob scene that one could readily find on the cover of today's Newsweek or other periodicals. ( The old adage that history repeats itself is quite evident throughout the film and one of Argo's strongest points. ) As the director, Affleck's meticulous research and attention to detail can be found in every frame of this film. The costumes with its late 70's vibe, the vivid art direction, and the casting of actors with similar physical traits as the hostages ( except for a more handsome Affleck himself in leading man mode substituting for the more average looking real counterpart ), all of these elements blend perfectly into that era. ( Make sure you stay for the end credits to compare for yourself. )At times, Argo seems to be two very good movies in one: it's one part comedy, one part action film. The early portion film concentrates on the film's origins as Mendez tries to establish some background history and fake publicity to authenticate a genuine Hollywood production in the works before the mission begins. Affleck incorporates Hollywood's faux- hipness very well, giving the film a marvelous satirical tone and rhythm. He gets some nice comedic performances by John Goodman as real-life make-up expert, John Chambers , and especially Alan Arkin as a completely fictionalized cagey producer, Lester Siegel . These two actors deliver their funny zingers with impeccable timing which attests to their fine skills as consummate pros. Later, when the actual mission evolves, the film becomes a tense political thriller, even if you already know the outcome of the rescue mission. Affleck is a bit bland and overly stoic in this section of the film. Granted his role is less showy and the actor downplays his action figure status, but it is still a fine portrayal of a man who takes his job and the lives of his fellow Americans all too seriously. The film builds suspense subtly in its airport scene and the impact never seems forced or remotely stilted.Special mention must also go to the insightful script by Chris Terrio. The screenplay is concise, the dialog is extremely well written, and its characters never grandstand or become preachy archetypes of the American ideals. All seem totally relatable and human, everyday people caught in an international quagmire.Argo is one of the best films in this lackluster year. ( It's mid-October already and only 2 films have earned highly recommended status from me so far. ) The film resists the urge to be a more profitable bloody shoot-em-up tale for a younger movie-going audience and instead chooses to be an adult political espionage thriller whose excitement is in its character development and complicated twists and turns. In Argo, Affleck takes his mission to make a compelling and intelligent film very seriously too. Mission accomplished.

Star Trek Into Darkness," Boldly Going Forth
","This film is highly recommended.Space...the final frontier. That's our destination and those nasty Klingons are at it again in J.J. Abrams' second installment of the Star Trek series. The Enterprise, with its easily recognized and beloved crew that includes the trustworthy Scotty (Simon Pegg), the seductive but smart Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and the flinty Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban), go to battle to keep the interplanetary peace in Star Trek: Into Darkness. Also on board are Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) with his forced Russian accent, and of course, their stoic and reckless captain, Jim Kirk (the handsome blue-eyed Chris Pine), and his half-man, half-Vulcan friend, Spock (the immeasurably entertaining Zachary Quinto). Added to the mix is Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), a perky blonde Starfleet crew member who just may become Kirk's love interest. All are center stage to chart the course to boldly go where no man has gone before.￼Written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Damon Lindelof, Star Trek: Into Darkness follows the series' idealistic philosophy of racial tolerance and peaceful coexistence while adding more than enough big battles and galactic warfare to show off the film's excellent CGI big budget effects by Industrial Light and Magic. The well-crafted action sequences do go on a bit too long in parts, but one does need to catch their breathe between action set pieces. ￼Without revealing too much of the plot, the Enterprise crew is out to capture a terrorist bomber named John Harrison this time around. Abrams rejuvenates the popular series by resurrecting the next generation of younger actors to fill in for those classic roles and flattery is the highest form of imitation in this case. All of the actors take their coveted roles seriously, with special kudos for this mission going to Pine, Quinto, and Pegg. ￼The screenwriters wisely incorporate numerous battle scenes while still emphasizing the human drama aboard the Enterprise. The simplistic storyline is merely an outline to the barrage of CGI that enliven the film and set up the background for the characters' intimate relationships. Making this particular film so successful is again that tried-and true, if somewhat predictable, winning formula that continues to work for both the television series and the film franchise: the uneasy alliance between Spock and Kirk. Their on-going disagreements and bromance are the most engaging parts of the film as they bond together to fight against those evil forces intent with world annihilation. Evil in Star Trek: Into Darkness is chillingly represented by its villain, played the talented Benedict Cumberbatch. The actor brings with him an intensity and intelligence to his performance, which helps to elevate the level of intrigue and danger.￼Abrams choreographs the action well and has crafted a visually stunning film. The director vividly stages the action sequences with colorful imagery, various aerial shots, and wonderful perspectives to intensify the dramatic elements at play. Production values are all top notch. Stunning photography by Daniel Mindel, detailed set design by Scott Chambliss, and strong film editing from Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey contribute to much of the film's success. The prosthetics and make-up heighten the film's overall impact as does the aforementioned special effects. Michael Giacchino pays fine homage to the theme music and other flourishes he uses to enhance the action on screen. Star Trek: Into Darkness takes its audience for a terrific fantasy ride. Sci-fi fans won't be disappointed and neither will the average moviegoer. With this second addition to their series, Abrams and his able crew continue to make this franchise live long and prosper.

"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy, Stupid, Love. :: Funny, Smart, Movie.
","This film is recommended.Crazy, Stupid, Love. is not really crazy or, thank God, stupid, but it does speak eloquently of love and relationships with a honesty sorely lacking in most rom-coms these days. The film is a refreshingly honest glimpse of love and all its complications with a large amount of humor and pathos to spare.After 20 plus years, Emily wants a divorce from Cal, a happily married family man, although he'd rather have the Creme Brulee on the menu than hear the news. Set adrift, Cal is forced to enter the world of dating and is mentored by Jacob, a six-packed sexy ladies man who is slicker than slick. Meanwhile, Jacob goes from woman to woman until he meets Hannah, a no-nonsense savvy young lady. Both men are suddenly in free fall, quickly in need of re- evaluating their vastly different lives.Solidly directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, Crazy, Stupid, Love. ( Yes, that is the correct punctuation for the title. ) is a rarity in romantic comedies. It is romantic and it is a comedy with genuine laughs that do not sacrifice characterization or plot structure. It does not pander to cheap laughs or raunchy sophomoric humor. It is a mature look at mature people acting immaturely. ( Even teenagers, like Cal's son, Robbie ( Jonah Bobo ), who has a crush on his babysitter, Jessica ( Analeigh Tipton ), who has a crush on Cal, are handled with respect and poignancy. By the way, both young actors excel in their roles. )The film has a biting sense of irony with its clever and witty dialog throughout most of the film until it veers into sitcom territory with some of the absurd circumstances foisted on the characters. Yes, there are also some nifty unexpected twists towards the end, leading to a totally improbable situation of farcical proportions, that, while played for laughs, is a tad illogical. Also, some of these characters' excessive reactions become a bit cartoony with silly responses that undercut the deeper and more heartfelt moments that the film successfully captures due to the well written script by Dan Fogelman and the fine acting from the gifted ensemble.High praise goes to Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as the divorcing parents, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the young lovers. Carell displays a piercing vulnerability that commands the screen and I was even more impressed by his dramatic acting skills than his usual everyman droll persona. Moore is his perfect counterpart, a woman conflicted by age and complacency, caught in a marital middle ground of uncertainty. Gosling takes an unlikeable Lothario role and layers it with fresh humor and impeccable comic timing. Stone adds an easy charm and poise to her cynical professional character. The roles of Cal's and Emily's rebound lovers, played by Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, though well acted, seem to be from another film and are played for much broader laughs, one of the few missteps in this fine comedy.￼Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a humorous and insightful film that sees our crazy stupid human flaws and celebrates them with laughter, love, and much wisdom.

The Babadook," Things That Go Bump in the Night
","This film is recommended.Mister Babadook is the bogeyman, that thing that goes bump in the night and ruins a child's sleep, the waking nightmare that disturbs young children and adults alike. In this case, he is found in a picture-book owned by Samuel (Noah Wiseman), a problem child if there ever was one. His mother, Amelia (Essie Davis) is at her wit's end, raising a child alone and still grieving over the death of her husband seven years ago. Both cannot get a good night's sleep. Amelia is lonely and angst-ridden. Sam is obsessed with this demon coming into their home and their dreams. But is the Babadook real or imaginary? In either case, both mother and child are acting far from normal.The Babadook is a tense psychological horror film. It focuses on primal fear and rarely deviates from its course. Director Jennifer Kent also wrote the intriguing screenplay and she spends the first half of the film establishing the relationship between parent and child well before the first entrance of the title character. One begins to wonder when the horror will start. But start it does, and it never looks back.While Kent's screenplay toys with the audience and build suspense at a slow pace, her direction is more focused and in total control. She implies the horror, never resorting to cheap scares, and in doing so, creates a haunting portrait of a family coming undone. Her approach is very theatrical and effective, using light and shadows to create the tension. She tries to keep the action in a logical sequence, even if she relies a bit too heavily on disconcerting montage effects. There is plenty of eerie foreboding imagery, foremost from the surreal pop-up book itself, with wonderful illustrations by Alexander Juhasz. The rooms in the house, ell photographed by Radek Ladczuk, have a claustrophobic atmosphere, with everything and everyone just slightly off kilter. (For example, why would a loving mother read her child scary bedtime stories if he has these nightly issues?) The demanding key roles are so well played by the actors involved. Little Mr. Wiseman can be endearing or irritating as Samuel and the young actor shows a perfect range of emotions as this hellion. Australian actress Essie Davis is remarkable as Samuel's mother. Her character is physically and emotionally battered, almost damaged and beyond repair. Ms. Davis shows off the frustration, vulnerability, and terror to full advantage. This performance deserves to be seen and lauded.As with all horror films, the set-up and payoff is important. The film poses three distinct reasons for the horror that seems to be occurring:1. Sam may be a demon child with violent tendencies. 2. Mother is clinically depressed and on the verge of a breakdown. 3. The Babadook may actually be a supernatural being focused on harming the family.By the film's end, only one of these possibilities is ruled out, leaving the moviegoer again faced with ambiguity. The film's multiple endings never really confirm the mysterious happenings in the household or the reasons behind them. So the pay-off is a tad less satisfying. But The Babadook remains a complex and fascinating horror thriller, one that lingers long after the film ends. Sleep well.

Us," Double Trouble
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A good thriller that has its share of scares and jumps, but also some leaps of logic.JIM'S REVIEW: Remember that old Twilight Zone episode starring Inger Stevens as a woman alone on a road trip being terrorized by her doppelgÃ¤nger hitchhiker, a ghostly paranormal look-alike? Well, add more gore and suspense, multiple by four, and you have its updated and horrifying new clone by Jordan Peele, simply called Us.Meet the Wilsons, a typical family on a family vacation at an upscale beach house for a fun-filled week that does not go as planned. One evening, sinister intruders arrive in their driveway and they look strangely similar, but with more evil in their souls. Soon it is a 'them versus us' scenario in a life and death struggle with supernatural forces.To say more about the plot would ruin the blood-spattered scares, of which there are many. The less you know, the better the enjoyment of this type of movie. (The film's basic concept reminded me of a lesser but still frightening film, The Strangers (2008). That film built suspense well but delivered an ultimately lackluster and unsatisfying ending. Us has more impact and social relevance, although it edges too 'sharply' into the slasher film genre and does have some issues in its third act as well.)Yes, this movie appears to be a standard horror film, with better production values, a strong cast, and skillful direction, but Mr. Peele has much more to say than that. He shows the darker side of the American family, with its wealthy 1% reaping society's rewards, oozing of both black and white privilege. This is a tense psychological study of our polarized nation, a physical battle against our avarice and ourselves, It is his view of America with all its class warfare purged with weapons of mass destruction.As a director, Mr. Peele sets up his scenes with the most assured and expert touch. (Loved the opening sequence at the boardwalk and funhouse.) As a writer, he uses humor and satire to throw off the audience before the reveal. Where he doesn't always succeed is in his dense narrative and explanation of his plot structure. His film is brimming forth of intriguing ideas, not all of which are made clear when we get to the film's far-fetched ending. Mr. Peele's clever premise just does not hold up logically, even if his moviegoing audience is enjoying his macabre story with all its twists and turns.But this is a minor quibble to his ability to create a satisfying horror film with genuine class. (Special mention goes out to cinematographer Mike Gioulakis for his atmospheric lens work. His dramatic light and shadows and use of deep reds and sterile whites gives the film its distinctive look. Michael Abel's music score helps greatly too.)Mr. Peele wisely casts his film with actors that bring the necessary vulnerability to the family unit while doing double time as their deadly menacing counterparts most effectively. Winston Duke winningly plays Gabe Wilson, a likable cool dad (to mostly himself). Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex as his children, Zora and Jason, make a fine tag team and give strong natural performances. Elizabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker provide some comic and tense moments as their entitled friends. But it is Lupita Nyong'o's portrayal of a mother protecting her cubs that literally tethers the film with such gravitas and power. Watching her playing dual roles makes the film work so very well.Us is a good solid thriller...not as strong as his debut film, Get Out, but certainly a worthy successor by a talented filmmaker.",8,2,10,23 March 2019
The Danish Girl," A Natural Woman
","(Rating: ☆☆½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended. In brief: Two fine performances are lost in a wearisome biopic.GRADE: B-Back in the 1920's, Gerda Wegener created erotic female portraits. Asking her artist husband, Einar to don women's clothes and pose for these paintings paved the way for his sexual liberation and freed his inner identity as Lili Erbe in Tom Hooper's uneven biopic, The Danish Girl. The film tells the story of the makings of one of the first transgenders, even though some of the actual facts are glossed over and never accurately presented. ￼The film depicts the balancing act that this married couple faced with the proper degree of poignancy as they both come to terms with Einar's vibrant counterpart. Lili's persona starts to overshadow him. Naturally these changes affect their relationship as the gender issue becomes irreversible. While Einar opts for sex reassignment surgery, Gerda must deal with her own emotions through this turmoil and decide her rightful place in Einar's / Lili's life. That the roles are played by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander only enhances the film's impact.Hopper does craft his film well and give his talented leads enough leeway to create indelible characters, due more to the credit of the actors' prowess than the actual writing. In fact, the dull screenplay by Lucinda Coxon never allows them to act realistically to their life-changing situation. Yes, they are both free spirits and eccentric artist types but these major events would certainly test any Bohemian lifestyle to the max. (This is especially true in the pivotal first scene when Greta under-reacts when discovering her husband's secret penchant for wearing women's clothing. Her response rings false.)￼One can readily admire the filmmakers' sincerity and earnestness with this project. But this important subject deserves a more realistic spin than the lyrical approach that Hooper decides to take as the director. He downplays the serious nature of the film with too many lingering travelogue shots of Copenhagen and other period details. The pacing of the film becomes tedious and slower than Einar's own physical change. Beside the script by being problematic, so is the actual physical transformation by Redmayne from Einer to Lili. One never quite believes that he is a she. (It is most jarring in a scene where he dons the female garb to be 'my fair lady' at the ball when everyone is all eyes at this ravishing 'non-beauty'. Yet another flawed moment.) The actor, while displaying enough feminine mannerisms, cannot convincingly transcend the transgender role due to the hair and make-up design of his character. ￼Still, Eddie Redmayne makes some bold choices in the title role and lets his character underplay the uncertainty in the outset and become more selfish and determined toward the end. (In fact, there is one nicely structured scene when the actor starts to mimic the sexual movements of a prostitute that shows the inner struggle that tore at Einar. This inspired moment tells more beyond mere words.) Even making the situation more effecting is Alicia Vikander as his loving spouse. Her character is torn between the man she married and the woman she admires. Ms. Vikander is a revelation, giving a nicely modulated performance by showing her subtle range in her emotional highs and lows. Amber Head as their friend, Ulla, brings some sparks to her lifeless role. Other supporting turns by Matthias Schoenaerts and Ben Whishaw never rise to that level of excellence due to the sketchy nature of the characters they play.Alas, despite the superior acting by the two leads, The Danish Girl is in need of some personal realignment as well.",6,7,16,26 December 2015
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Euro Trash (But in a Good Way)
","GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Entertaining but light-weight comedy about dreaming your dream.JIM'S REVIEW: Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is a very long title for a very long movie. The film is a goofy and slight satirical comedy. Its easy target is an international song competition that promotes pop ditties representing various countries with lavish staging, pyrotechnic effects, and garish costumes. Call it a underdog story or an amusing Rocky rewrite with purposely bad music.Written by Andrew Steele and one of its stars, comedian Will Ferrell, the film tells its Icelandic tale of a middle age loser named Lars Erickssong whose dream it is to win the Eurovision contest, the musical equivalent of a vocal Olympics Game. His singing partner is Sigrit EricksdÃ³ttir (a very winning Rachel McAdams), who, for some unknown reason, idolizes her bandmate. Their pairing is an imbalance, not only script-wise but as an acting team.The movie is silly fun, although, Mr. Ferrell is miscast in his own script. The actor does have some nice sight gags and pratfalls, but most of the time he belabors his character and lets his performance go off kilter. He plays Lars as if he is still performing on a SNL skit. There is no real chemistry or depth of character here and it's hard to believe his 'middle age status'. (He is a bit long in the walrus tusk for this role.) In all honesty, his performance simply lacks the light comedic charm needed to pull off this part and he weighs down all the joyous buffoonery from others in the cast. The miscasting is very obvious as he acts opposite the talented Ms. McAdams, who has a natural flair for comedy. She is a perfect fit, almost a 10. Also providing humorous moments are Pierce Brosnan as Lar's disapproving father and Dan Stevens as the narcissistic Russian crooner.Actually, the best parts of the movie are the snippets of the half-baked musical numbers. These fleeting moments are on-target spoofs with the typically over-produced staging and sexualized performances gyrating in full satirical view. Highlighting these scenes would have made a much funnier film. The filmmakers should have considered making this intriguing concept as a mockamentary instead of the formulaic rom/com that it is. If they had focused more on the outrageousness of the competition and shown the musical entries in their entirety, leaving out much of the predictable story, the movie would have been more laugh-out-loud funny than merely diverting fodder.Directed by tongue-in-cheek ill reverence by David Dobkin, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga barely makes the semi-finals.",6,1,1,7 July 2020
Ted," Too Much to Bear
","This film is mildly recommended.Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's raunch-fest, Ted, a smutty little R- rated comedy that became one of this year's biggest hits. However, the film's real star is a foul-mouthed but lovable teddy bear named Teddy. He's kinda a cross between Snuggles the Bear and Chester the Molester. Depending on your own personal taste, this comedy will either be an outrageous laugh riot or just a gross turn-off. ( I was somewhere in-between. ) The slim story goes like this: One day a little boy named John Bennett wishes that his cuddly bedtime companion would come to life and, sure enough, his wish comes true. Twenty seven years later, a grown-up John (Wahlberg) and his bud are still together, although John begins to rue that day as the rowdy Ted fills his life with enough debauchery and lewdness while ruining his romantic chances with Lori (Kunis). Of course, complications and embarrassing moments beset the characters and their bromance, including drugs, prostitutes, and other hedonistic pursuits.That's the basic premise in this formulaic comedy which does have some funny and clever lines but more not-so-funny and, frankly, very predictable scenes as one would expect to find in this type of film. Still both Wahlberg and Kunis provide a nice chemistry and there is solid comic support by Giovanni Ribisi, Joel McHale, and the original Flash Gordon and ex- Playgirl model, Sam Jones as himself. MacFarlane deftly voices Ted and co-wrote the hit- and-miss screenplay ( with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild ). This film also marks his directorial debut and MacFarlane has done a commendable job in all of those departments. The best moments come from the CGI which embodies Ted with the right facial expressions and movement to give him a winning personality and make the character come alive.Ted may be off-putting and offensive to some moviegoers, but if you have a high tolerance of this sort of off-colored brand of humor and sophomoric shenanigans, the film just might be enough fun. Too often the film went for shock value and cheap laughs with a forced vulgarity as its primary goal. The film never bothers to explain or delve into Ted's transition from the cute little teddy bear of yesteryear to the profanity spewing furry lout of today. ( Now that exposition could have made the film far more interesting.) Anyway, anything goes in this movie. Everything is fair game and a comic target for MacFarlane. Ted doesn't always hit the comic bullseye, but it does aim to please those liberal-minded moviegoers in the audience. GRADE: B-",6,0,0,7 February 2013
Knives Out," A Sharp Send-up to the Whodunnit Done Well
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An highly entertaining murder mystery that harks back to an early time and succeeds as a delightful tribute to the classic whodunnit genre.JIM'S REVIEW: Knives Out is a nifty little murder mystery that pays homage to the once popular whodunnit genre. Rian Johnson assembles a fine cast of actors and writes his carefully plotted screenplay to masterful effect. Any armchair detective or moviegoer should enjoy this intriguing diversion.Mr. Johnson sets up his mystery in an elegant old mansion, the home of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a successful mystery writer who sets the plot in motion on his 85th birthday celebration by agitating family members with secrets and scandals afoot. His demise seems like a foregone conclusion with many of his children and their offsprings all having enough anger and motives to do the old fellow in.The main suspects and possible heirs to the family fortune include: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), Harlan's eldest daughter, and her husband, Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's youngest son, Walt (Michael Shannon), who is in charge of his father's publishing house, and Joni (Toni Collette), Harlan's free-spirited daughter-in-law. Also brought into the fray are Harlan's spoiled grandson with the unfortunate nickname, Ransom (Chris Evans), Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell), two more of Harlan's grandchildren, and Marta (Ana de Armas), his loyal and loving nurse who cannot tell a lie. Along with the local police team investigating the case, Detective Lieutenant Elliot (Lakeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (Noah Segan), is super sleuth and private detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). The cast is uniformly strong, and watching them inhabit their roles is a particular pleasure, with Mr.Plummer, Ms. de Armas, and a wonderful Mr. Craig as stand-outs.Knives Out keeps one guessing as all good mystery should do and while it stays within the Thrombey home, the story remains true to its roots. But, in the third act, the film unwisely opens up its atmospheric setting and loses some of its cherished momentum with an unexciting car chase sequence, some unnecessary plot twists, and a slightly disappointing ending.Still, Mr. Johnson's solidly uses style and ingenuity in his overall construction of his whodunnit and directs with flair. This is especially true when he incorporates his visual images to reveal the true goings-on of the events in question which directly contradicts the suspect's alibis. The audience seems to get the upper hand before the team of detectives start their deductions, making the story more complex and entertaining.Knives Out is a clever nostalgic send-up of the old murder mystery whodunnit done well. This Clue-like stage has been set for an old-fashioned murder and the mystery formula remains intact. Yes, this modern update is a welcome reimagining of the classic whodunnit and has enough charm and intelligence that would make Dame Agatha proud. Sleuth on!",8,5,20,24 November 2019
The Irishman," A Gangster Saga that Slays It
","GRADE: A-THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An excellent view into a gangster's life, brought to life by one of America's greatest director.JIM'S REVIEW: Experiencing Martin Scorsese's epic gangster tale, The Irishman, is seeing great art delivered by a master craftsman. The film, over three hours in length, tells its true story that 'crime doesn't pay' in the most common of terms, but the visual sweep of the storytelling is mesmerizing. With superb production values and three of the best performances, the movie is one of the year's finest films.Subject wise, this is safe territory for Mr. Scorsese. He lived on those mean streets and made a career with his many films of Mafia life. His film is based on a confessional biography about hitman Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran entitled I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. Steven Zaillian skillfully adapts his literate screenplay and delves into this violent world focusing on Sheeran's notorious rise as we witness his crimes and murders.Robert DeNiro plays Frank and this is one of his best roles in years. The character reminisces about his career and the toll it took on his family and friends. He plays his unlikable character with no remorse and a pure disregard for mankind, an unethical man with no moral conscience. It is a solid commanding performance.Providing dual support is Joe Pesci as Frank's crime boss, Russ Bufalino, and Al Pacino as Teamster racketeer, Jimmy Hoffa. Mr. Pesci underplays his character to maximum effect and his interpretation of a cruel and calculating don is chilling. Mr. Pacino has the more showier role and, at first, he overdoes his ranting schtick with too much yelling and cursing, but he finally settles into the role and adds some depth and substance that make his character all the more human.Other cast members include Anna Paquin, Ray Romano, Gary Basaraba, Jesse Plemons, and a memorable Stephen Graham as Hoffa's nemesis, Anthony 'Tony Pro' Provenzano. Also contributing their talents are Bobby Cannavale, Jack Huston, and Harvey Keitel, although they are underused in their underdeveloped parts.The film's narrative spans five decades, starting from the 1950's, and the artisans' work behind the scenes to capture the various eras is outstanding. The production design is impeccable in its accuracy and its rich period details. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is truly exceptional with fluid camera movements, strong use of slo-mo effects, and carefully lit close-ups. Thelma Schoonmaker's concise editing establishes the needed tension and keeps the action front and center. Costumes by Christopher Peterson and Sandy Powell add all the finishing touches to one of the year's most visually arresting films.Yet while the film has so much to admire, there are a few minor flaws. The predictable story does tend to meander a bit in the middle section and some smaller roles are strictly reinforced negative Italian stereotypes. Much has also been said about the de-aging process, making the three lead actors substantially younger in years by using CGI technology. The overall effect for this reviewer was uneven, like cinematic Photoshopping, but with only partly successful results. Some of the visual enhancement worked, others lacked the high definition and looked slightly unfocused and artificial.But Mr. Scorsese's vision is as sharp and crystal clear as ever. He masterminds the entire film and is in top form here. It is he who deserves all the many accolades for this superior film. This accomplished director has created yet another masterwork to add to his impressive resume.In The Irishman, one character wisely warns another, 'You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation.' With sage advice like this, realize that this is an offer you just can't refuse, dear moviegoers. Do not miss this film!",10,1,8,29 November 2019
Creed," A Knockout (Almost)
","(Rating: ☆☆☆½ out of 4)This film is highly recommended.In brief: A crowd-pleaser that carries its own weight due to some fine acting and direction.GRADE: B+Since The Champ appeared in the 1930's, the genre of boxing film has been an on-going cliché of sorts, the downtrodden overcoming the many hardships placed in his way. Always slow- motion shots abound...plus, training montages...the hand-held circular camera-work at ringside...leading up to the final bout! Even reviews of these sporting films become tiresome and unoriginal...'A real knockout!'...'Down for the count!'...'It pulls no punches!'...'Throw in the towel!' ( I will try and spare you these puns, although I cannot promise that I will succeed.)A select few overcome the familiarities of the genre and achieve greatness like Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby. Some creating memorable moments like The Fighter, Requiem for a Heavyweight, Fat City, and the original Rocky. Others fail miserably like Grudge Match (a Stallone dud) and Against the Ropes, but most follow the winning formula with a high degree of entertainment. Creed is an exception to the rule when rating tales of pugilists. It works very well and avoids most of the clichés (but not all) due to some fine acting and sharp direction, even if the script is featherweight, routine and totally predictable.Donny Johnson, a.k.a. Adonis Creed, feels the need to follow in his lost father's footsteps, enlisting the help of former champ, Rocky Balboa as his trainer. That's the simple premise of the film in which director / writer Ryan Coogler wisely concentrates on the human drama more than the blood sport, although his fight sequences are quite brutal. His direction is solid, except for a clumsy inspiration uplift scene involving bikers fans and his over-reliance upon the Rocky source, complete with musical cues and nostalgic images. He stages the boxing sequences most effectively and builds a nice chemistry between his actors.Michael B. Jordan is a revelation in the role as Apollo Creed's illegitimate son. He shows the inner conflict and rage within the man, delivering a powerful performance. Sylvester Stallone redeems himself with a restrained and understated portrayal of his famous screen icon, successfully erasing the memory of his recent film work as an aging action star. Tessa Thompson makes a vivid impression playing Bianca, Adonis' love interest.All in all, Creed surprisingly packs an emotional wallop (sorry!), thanks to the fancy footwork (oops, once again) of Mr. Coogler and company.",9,1,3,28 February 2016
Brokeback Mountain," Lonesome Love
","This film is highly recommended.Ang Lee's mediative and powerful film about a love that dare not speak its name, even with a western twang. Set in Wyoming during the early 60's, two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, feel an intense but natural bond as they become drawn to each other over the years. Their initial rapport starts off quite physically before becoming a special but secretive relationship, one that could jeopardize their more conventional relationships and their own lives.Nominated for 7 Academy Awards ( Winner of 3 Oscars including screenplay, original music score, and Best Director ) the film lost out to Crash that year which many say was an injustice caused by homophobia. The film is a tragic and, at times, haunting masterpiece regardless of that outcome. Director Lee's frank yet sensitive treatment of a developing same sex relationship starts off very leisurely with a tad too many scenic atmospheric images of sunsets and mountain vistas, but build dramatically as the romance begins to deepen. Just as the characters are swept up into the romance, so is the film-goer.The acting is superlative by its cast ( including an up and coming young Anne Hathaway as Lureen, Joe's girlfriend ) with star turns by Michelle Williams as Ennis' lost soul of a wife, Alma, and Jake Gyllenhaal as his sexy and confused boyfriend, both deservingly nominated in supporting categories. Yet it the late Heath Ledger that transcends his role as a married man yearning for love and finding it too late. His performance is so nuanced and touching. He conveys the anguish and passion both in what he does physically as an actor and what he does intuitively with his hesitant actions, his halted speech patterns, and his far-off introspective stares. It is a completely masterful performance. ( His final parting scene is so heartfelt and gut-wrenching to watch that it leaves one moved to tears. It has also become an iconic moment in modern cinematic history. )The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana captures the era well and contains many memorable moments of dialog as the film depicts an unorthodox affair with such refreshing honesty and raw emotion. Production values are top notch also. Lee and his cast accomplish a wonderful blending of melancholy and genuine artistry. Brokeback Mountain will break your heart as it illuminates the human condition.",Null,5,5,6 September 2011
About Time," Passing Time
","This film is mildly recommended.That tried and true formula about time travel is working overtime in About Time. a pleasing but slight little comedy. Just how many films have successfully taken this plot device and made it fresh and appealing. Not many. (Midnight in Paris, Back to the Future, Twelve Monkeys, Big, Time After Time, and The Terminator come to mind.) However, the number of movies which take that gimmick to hackneyed and overdone results seem endless. (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Time Traveler's Wife, The Philadelphia Experiment, Premonition, Kate and Leopold, 17 Again, The Adjustment Bureau, The Lake House, The Butterfly Effect, Frequency, Somewhere in Time, and The Final Countdown, all misfires that still boggle my mind.) With About Time, many moviegoers will find this latest version of time hopping delightful, even romantic. I found it to be an innocuous trifle, a diverting enough two hours of amusement. The film has its charm, mostly due to its likable cast, but it follows that overused 'what if' time-changing formula and rarely pushes its own limits. It stay safely within the lines and never wants to journey outside the box, at least until its conclusion. The simple story follows the familiar road map of time travel ala Groundhog Day, another pleasant comedy with the same theme in mind. Tim is without a love connection, a misfit on the dating scene. After a father-son discussion on his 21st birthday, he suddenly learns that he can change what has happened in his own life to his advantage. His past mistakes can now be rectified and his future looks more promising with this newly acquired power. Although he cannot change history, he can relive those awkward moments and at least somewhat control his own destiny and finally get a girlfriend.Domnhall Gleeson plays Tim and he is fine in this role. It's not a real stretch, but he makes his character believable even with this unbelievable set-up. Rachel McAdams is his love interest, Mary, and this actress also generates some innovation to a clichéd role. There is a strong chemistry between the two young actors which helps to elevate the predictability of the film. Even better is Bill Nighy as Tim's wise father. Nighy brings subtlety and warmth to his patriarch role and his acting skills are precise and spot-on.Richard Curtis wrote and directed this movie. His specialty seems to be the romantic comedy genre (the annoying Bridget Jones' Diary, the better Notting Hill and Love Actually films, and the superb Four Weddings and a Funeral ) and this film is one of his minor efforts. This time, his script starts off way too cute and takes awhile to build any real emotion or tension. The film is almost stuck in its own self-imposed time warp, afraid to jump from sentimental sit- com situations to honest adult issues. It's not until the midpoint of the film that About Time finally deals with familial complications that directly affect the relationship between Tim and Mary, and only then, does the film begin to become compelling. (Still, as with other films of this genre, this film falls prey to the illogic of time travel and its proliferation of selective changes and their lack of repercussions that never mesh with the character's sense of reality.)Perhaps if Curtis had spent more time and more initial re-writings with his screenplay, About Time would have become a more memorable love story. As it is, it's not the worst of times you will have, but then it's not the best either. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,7,15,12 November 2013
Spotlight," Sins of the Fathers
","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: This powerful yet restrained exposé of the sexual crimes against children should be required viewing by all.GRADE: A-Tom McCarthy's Spotlight takes its laser-sharp aim at the Catholic Church and its extensive cover-up of many pedophile acts by its priests against hundreds of child victims throughout the world. The film focuses in on the beginnings of these cases, going back to 1976, and depicts the investigative research and reporting that finally exposed these heinous crimes.￼We immediately are drawn to a group of top-notch columnists at the Boston Globe as they begin to follow some leads and theories into certain alleged acts that have been overlooked by many parishioners and various institutions throughout the city, including the newspaper itself. The film is a riveting behind-the-scenes look at this story and it thoroughly captures the ennui and the sense of passion and discovery that goes into the job of a reporter brilliantly, with its subtle touches of paper-shrouded desktops and tight cubicles littered with post-notes and family photographs.￼Based on the true events, the film is interested in reporting the facts of the long research- extensive process and its impact on the investigative team called Spotlight, a team that will later go on to win a Pulitzer Prize for its exposé. The acting is wonderful, one of the strongest ensembles this year. Mark Ruffalo plays the overworked lead reporter, Michael Rezendes, and he shows the characters' inner strength and stamina with a performance that understates the horror he sees as he talks to the various victims and fights for their cause. Rachel McAdams delivers one of her finest roles as Sacha Pfeiffer, a lapse Catholic. Her scene where she interviews a suspected priest is particularly memorable in its matter-of-fact conversation. Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll, the third reporter on the team, brings the physical outrage front and center. Adding yeoman-like support are Liev Schreiber and John Slattery as the editors who helped to break the story, and Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, an obsessed lawyer fighting for his young clients' rights. All are splendid, as are Jamey Sheridan, Billy Crudup, Neil Huff, and Len Cariou as the unethical Cardinal Law.￼But it is Micheal Keaton who is the standout in his supporting turn as Walter 'Robby' Robinson, the chief editor of the Spotlight team. The actor layers his character with an underlining grace and intelligence. He interprets this role by playing Robby as a soft-spoken observer and hardened professional and it is such a nuanced and completely believable performance. The character leads the team on its steady course amid subtle threats and allegations and Keaton leads and centers the other actors around his straightforward portrayal. One hopes that his work he will not go unnoticed during award season.￼The director, who also wrote the screenplay along with Josh Singer, uses his narrative skills masterfully. The film relies heavily on its insightful dialog and well-defined characters. Much of the film is talk with very little action, but the story itself is thoroughly engrossing. McCarthy also uses strong imagery to reinforce his film, with scenes of the massive Catholic churches dwarfing and overshadowing the smaller houses and playgrounds within the city to maximum effect (Kudos to Masanobu Takayanagi's cinematography, Howard Shore's non-intrusive music score, and Tom McArdle's effective editing.)￼The film shies away from lurid details and is, at times, too restrained than needed. It sidesteps any real melodrama and resists the urge to manipulate its audience and toy with their emotions. Rather, it fully encompasses the scandal in a by-the book approach to its subject, a clinical remote approach, and lets the moviegoer learn more and more about the cases as the evidence is slowly revealed. In fact, the only emotional tirade comes from the lead reporter only once in the film, literally about the sins of the Fathers. There is no other hysterical outbursts or angry speeches, no sound and fury in telling this tale, just an objective and powerful retelling of the awful truth that we normally try to avoid.￼Spotlight uncovers the truths and tells its story in a honest and gripping way. It's just the facts you see up there on the screen, no matter how ugly the truth may be. Go see this film, it's one of the year's best.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",10,4,8,22 November 2015
Thor: Ragnarok," Have Hammer, Will Travel
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Another comic book hero is given a major reboot with an accent more on comedy than logic sense or real drama.SYNOPSIS: Thor battles his revengeful evil sister.JIM'S REVIEW: The Marvel comic book universe is bursting at its spandex seams with all of its superheroes, both major or minor. One of the oddest of the lot has always been Thor, a god steeped in Norse mythology who possesses a magical hammer as his weapon of mass destruction. Thor: Ragnarok is now the third in the series that celebrates this hunky he-man, if one excludes his previous supporting roles and cameos in other Marvel movies of course. (That inter-breeding exists in this installment as well, with other superheroes like Dr. Strange and The Hunk making their entrances with their usual flair. Aside from some funny moments in this outing, nothing is there.)The nonsensical plot involves Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his bad brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) fighting their even badder banished sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), for ownership of their kingdom, Asgard. The film's narrative sets up major changes in this jocular central character. It updates Thor with a modern leaner look as the filmmakers dispatch his mighty hammer and his shoulder-length tresses at the film's midway point. Many battles ensue and Thor is sent across the universe to meet other perils along his journey to self discovery. Director Taika Waititi (who also does voice-over duty for one of the movie's creatures) turns up the comedy with mixed results. The overall campy tone works sometimes, that is, whenever Ms. Blanchett takes the reins to reign over our hero and his crusading sidekicks. More often the humor falls flat, particularly whenever Jeff Goldblum minces his way through the role as Grandmaster. (The actor is clueless with his character who should be menacing and a larger threat than the narcissistic power-hungry moron he portrays. Really, can anyone with those traits run a planet? Never mind.) Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins fill out the rest of the cast with as little screen time or presence as needed.The screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher L. Yost wants to pound us over the head with the silly hi-jinks and doesn't build any tension in its story because of its comic intent. The comedy simply undercuts the semi-seriousness of its ludicrous plot. It just can't have it both ways. If the film doesn't take itself seriously, why should we? The characters continually leaps from planet to planet, with no apparent reason. So does the script, making numerous leaps of logic to advance its puny plot.Except for the aforementioned awful performance of Mr. Goldblum, the rest of the cast works overtime to charm its audience. Chris Hemsworth as our slightly dim hero is again well toned and well cast. Giving strong support are Tom Hiddleston as the cunning Loki and Mark Ruffalo as Mr. Bipolar himself, The Hulk, a.k.a. Bruce Banner. The three actors have a nice rapport on screen that really registers. As the conflicted Skurge, Karl Urban adds some nuance to his underwritten character and Tessa Thompson has some some nice moments of female empowerment as Valkyrie, Female Warrior (channeling enough Michelle Rodriguez estrogen and persona into her supporting turn.)Still with all its flaws, the movie consistently entertains. Its most effective sequence in the entire movie is the gladiator inspired arena war between Thor and his green adversary which the director stages quite well. This set piece mixes the drama and comedy elements to full advantage. But too often, the many battle scenes are blurred and photographed upfront and personally in-your-face technique that obstructs the action. The CGI is mostly above average, although the best visual effect by far is Mr. Hemsworth's muscular physique in his shirtless scene. Thor: Ragnarok will awe its target audience, but this reviewer needs at least a hint of intelligence in its storytelling. Just how often do we need to leave our brains at the door whenever we step into this genre.",7,0,4,8 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," Ah, Paree! Ah, Woody Allen!
","This film is highly recommended.There are those who live in the past, those who celebrate life in the present, and those who look to the future for happiness. Director and screenwriter Woody Allen poses many questions in his sophisticated romantic comedy, Midnight in Paris : Do we romanticize the past to make our present and future seem bleak and remote? Can we ever appreciate the present and view it with the same glorious rose-colored glasses of the past? Does our sense of reality become impaired with what was, what is, and what will be? Can we ever learn to accept the time and place in which we live? Interesting musings persist in this amusing and clever film.Filling in for Allen and giving a fairly accurate impression of the comedic actor down to his halted speech patterns and sardonic demeanor is Owen Wilson as Gil, an American writer and tourist inspired with the Parisian way of life and nostalgic for the Golden Age of yore. He and his shrewish fiancÃ©e, Inez ( well acted by Rachel McAdams ), are there meeting her well-to-do conservative parents on holiday. This engaged couple really are opposites from the start: she prefers socializing, hobnobbing, and parties; he enjoys the arts, solitude, and introspective moments. At an elite party, Inez meets a pompous college professor ( a note perfect Michael Sheen ) with whom she becomes infatuated while Gil becomes alienated and exasperated by the whole social jet set. That evening, around midnight, Gil walks the rain soaked streets of the City of Lights and becomes lost. He stumbles across some partygoers who magically transport him back in time to the twenties, his favorite idealized time era, where he later meets his romantic muse, Adriana, mistress to Picasso, Modigliani, and his personal guide to the better life. Adriana is perfectly cast by the charming and lovely Marion Cotillard who brings such grace and enchantment to her pivotal role.Once touched by the romance of a bygone era, Gil eagerly goes it alone whenever the witching hour approaches, in hopes of mingling with the likes of literary celebrities and artists of the past: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stall as the writer gets to deliver some of the script's best lines), Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, etc. There is much name dropping and celebrity stereotyping as Gil timehops to the past which gets to be a bit of a monotonous plot device; yet it gives the film its intellectual and aesthetic appeal and emphasizes Allen's unique spin, ironic wit, and sparkling dialogue.Just as the director's earlier masterpiece Manhattan was his cinematic love letter to New York City, Midnight in Paris becomes one of his best films in years, It is his personal rendezvous with one of Europe's most romantic of destinations and Allen shows the city in all its glorious splendor. Yes, the city and his dreams successfully seduce Gil in this delightful flight of fancy ( or fantasy, in this case ) and Allen has thoroughly bewitched his audience with his magical modern day fairy tale of love and romance.

Ready Player One," Game Over
","GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well-made but ultimately empty exercise in virtuoso filmmaking.JIM'S REVIEW: The DeLoren and Back to the Future. Chucky the Killer Doll from Child's Play. The Overlook Hotel in The Shining. T-Rex from Jurassic Park. The holy McGuffin from Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail...items and places worth mentioning and on view in Stephen Spielberg's lively sci-fi fantasy movie, Ready Player One.We are taken into the world of virtual reality while worshiping any of the above pop culture reference from the 70's or 80's along the way. Ready Player One is pure escapist fun, but your level of satisfaction will depend entirely on your knowledge base of the trends and fads of the 70's / 80's era. (My level of expertise is in the middling range. All of the gaming references and arcade entertainment in this film were scored zero, but I do have strong creds with the many filmdom referrals with aided in my enjoyment of this film.) Apparently all of our world prior to those eras is non-existent, faded relics of days gone by (except for one word...Rosebud). But celebrating the whiz-bang escapades in an advanced Tron universe may be all one needs to hunker down to prepare for a rollicking good time. After all, we are in the hands and mind of a master director working overtime to impress us, and he sporadically does, if only on a purely visceral level.Ernest Cline's novel Ready Player One takes the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory premise and reboots that golden ticket to an escapist virtual reality game called OASIS where fantasy usurps a dark dystopian future. It is 2045 and as one character says, 'Reality is a real bummer.' People tune out their humdrum existence and tune in to the latest escape to an alternate world. It is there that a contest created by its crazed owner James Halliday (a winning Mark Rylance) entices them to own this Atari paradise. Unlimited wealth is the goal for whomever wins the most Easter Eggs and unlocks The Mystery of the Three Keys. Enter teen hero Wade (Tye Sheridan), a.k.a Parzival, his avatar counterpart, and his soon-to-be Scooby Doo gang: Aech, Daito, and Sho, plus Wade's love interest, Samantha (Olivia Cooke), a.k.a. Art3mis. It is they vs. CEO baddie Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), all eager for ownership of that coveted prize.Plot-wise, the film is only continuous chase loop after the next, with very little character development in between. The screenplay by Zak Penn and the author himself try to dole out the exposition and somewhat explain the perimeters of the game for those moviegoers that may be lost in virtual space, but it is very rough around the edges and the story goes increasingly off track. While there is no emotional connection, the movie has much eye-popping effects in its visual look.Director Spielberg certainly knows his craft, how to set up a scene, establish the high adrenaline pace, and deliver the thrills. Credit him and his editing team, Michael Kahn and Sarah Broshar, the ever-reliable cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and that music score veteran, Alan Silvestri, for their massive contributions. (Highlights include an exciting race car scene and a wonderful sequence into Kubrick territory, a neon-lit disco sequence less so.) This whole enterprise may be a trifle in Mr. Spielberg legacy of films, but it remains a well-made one.Less successful is the merging of the unreal and real worlds. The human story dulls in comparison with the more exciting fantasy storyline and never registers on an equal par with the virtual reality universe. And even in that unreal world, not all is right. The CGI avatar characters lack definition in their characters and renderings. Everyone seems to have an off-putting cartoonish look about them. They are upstaged by all the visual intricacies of their stunning surroundings and dazzling backgrounds. These figures lack the human details to involve this reviewer. The constant feeling of 'this is only a game' interfered with my full pleasure of this movie and the perils they faced just seemed too remote. As the film reaches its anti-climactic conclusion and the narrative strains for continuity, the film goes top-heavy and into forced overdrive becoming all sound and fury, a distracting cacophony of explosions, noise, smoke, and mirrors...the end result being overdone and empty.My involvement throughout this movie was diversionary, admiring Mr. Spielberg's sleigh of hand, even if the movie itself was hardly visionary. My overall reaction was always one of entertainment with a lackadaisical resigned feeling. But Ready Player One just may appeal to a younger generation of gamers and its mass targeted audience of teenagers looking for the next thrill to occupy their short attention spans. I just needed a bit more...or less.",7,3,6,31 March 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy
","This film is mildly recommended.The spy game ain't what it used to be. That's apparent when one compares the recent arrival of two films of espionage this holiday season. The differences are quite startling. The first offering is Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, a retro look at the spy industry and the Cold War mentality during the 1970's. ( The second entry is Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol, but more on that film next week. ) Trying to condense John le Carré 1974 British spy novel can be a formidable task, almost as daunting as finding a mole within the hierarchy of agents. Once an award winning seven part miniseries starring Alec Guinness in the lead role of George Smiley, TTSS now stars Gary Oldman as that super spy sleuth. Obviously, this film adaptation is shorter in length. It also sacrifices some important exposition, character motivation, and plot development in the process of revision.The plot, for those who don't know the original source, involves a double agent working secretively in British Intelligence. Control ( John Hurt ), the head of the organization, has narrowed down and code-named the list of suspects to include: Percy Alleline ( Tinker, played by Toby Jones ), Bill Haydon ( Tailor, a well cast Colin Firth ), Roy Bland ( Tailor, Ciarán Hinds in this role ), and Smiley himself ( Spy ). Also possibly on the list is Toby Esterhase ( David Dencik ). First Contol sends Jim Prideaux ( Mark Strong ) on the mission to track down the true identity of the mole ( if he chooses to accept the mission, which he does ). Things go terribly awry and soon George Smiley is heading the investigation.Oldman makes an effective Smiley, a man betrayed and unable to trust others within the organization. He is remote and cold, a bit of an enigma himself. Behind his wide frame glasses, Smiley remains a detached observer of the behavior swirling around him. The actor shows off this side of the man extremely well. But as it is written here, Oldman fails to bring out the insecurities and eccentricities of the main character. There is solid support by the aforementioned Firth, Dencik, and Strong, plus Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy as the younger breed of undercover agent. But some of the other supporting characters are given short rift and their lack of sufficient screen time hinders the compelling mystery. Ably directed by Tomas Alfredson, the film's structure and editing needlessly jumps forward and back in time, adding more confusion to an already dense plot. Though the mystery is finally resolved by the end, the moviegoer's journey to discover the culprit becomes harried and exhausting. Yes, the conclusion makes logical sense, but the film's lackadaisical pacing is all too tedious and conventional with the film's episodic format, undercutting any real impact.By far, the high point of TTSS is the fine period details in its costuming by Jacqueline Durran and the production design by Maria Djurkovic. Female secretaries, fashionably dressed, decode cryptic numerical messages as they listen to wiretapped conversations on large tape recorders, furiously pounding the keyboards on their then state-of-the art typewriters. Alfredson relishes the dated images as he creates a non-computerized world that never fails to fascinate in its atmospheric surroundings. ( A nice touch is the chessboard inspired boardroom at Intelligence headquarters. ) The director also films much of the action, or really the non-action, with distant shots ( ala Hitchcock's Rear Window ), or through grungy windows and narrow corridors to establish the paranoia of the times. The look of the film is so bloody good to watch!Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is just too convoluted for its own bloody good to thoroughly enjoy! GRADE: B-NOTE: The movie poster, with its clever mix of numbers and words, is one of the strongest thematic designs this year. As Oldman adjusts his spectacles for a closer look, the viewer is drawn into his stare. As we take a closer look, we can notice the changing hues of text that define his character and have hidden clues to the film itself. Just brilliant!NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",6,2,4,29 December 2011
The Hateful Eight," Blazing Addle
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: The West remains wild in Quentin Tarantino's bloody whodunit.GRADE: BFilmmaker auteur Quentin Tarantino mashes up the (very) bloody spaghetti Western with the stagy whodunit to make his eighth film, The Hateful Eight, with decidedly mixed results. Again, he is all hell and brimstone spreading a vitriolic attack on the senses peppered with N-words and profanity, this time from the Book of Christie, as in Agatha, as his plot device spins its wheels to tell its gruesome detective story.￼More content on shock value, both in his stilted dialog and graphic violence. the writer/director uses the mystery genre rather cleverly. Eight supposed strangers descend upon a cabin in the woods during a fierce snowstorm. Two are bounty hunters who meet along the way, Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and John Ruth (Kurt Russell). Ruth is delivering his prized prisoner, a ruthless killer named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) when they become stranded there with five other odd bedfellows: Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a racist (what else?) Confederate general named Sandy Smithers, and Bob the Mexican (Demian Bichir, overdoing a thick accent that would make Speedy Gonzales blush). One of them is not who he claims to be, rather an ally to Daisy, whose sole purpose is to free her at any cost. All are thoroughly unlikable characters caught in a Ten Little Indians set-up (minus the Indians), as one by one they bite the dust while we moviegoers try to find the culprit at large.￼The director has assembled many actors from his past films who know his quick rhythms and pacing technique while adding new members to his repertoire company and the end result is a nice invigorating ensemble. The acting is consistently strong with fine work by Mr. Jackson, Mr. Russell, and a memorable star turn by Ms. Leigh who makes the most of her showy role. However, Tarantino directs his actors as if it were in a theatrical set piece. As these snowbound travelers remain cabin-bound, the story become earthbound with its very stagy direction. One wishes for more wintry vistas rather than the majority of the film's small confines of the log house to hold our interest. One also wishes that the director would have hired another actor rather than use his own nasal reading to do the voice-over work.But the film's running length is even more of the problem, as it becomes tiresome and incongruous with much of what is said and done needing more concise direction. We all know Mr, Tarantino goes off on tangents, with a sharp emphasis on his second syllable of his last name. This time, the dialog lacks any clever invention and the conversations between the strangers is more strange than compelling. His attempts to connect our present world to the Wild West of yore is less successful, including the use of anachronistic phrases and songs. His lingering shots of sudden bloody mayhem undercuts the nicely built tension this time around and the film becomes derivative of his own stylish flair. One expects a bloodbath and one gets it by the finale. Less would have been more. (His previous film, Django Unchained, had the same problem with this reviewer.)￼Still the technical aspects of the movie are spot-on with stunning cinematography by the talented Robert Richardson and the music score by the legendary composer Ennio Morricone setting off the perfect mood for this piece of epic filmmaking. Kudos to Fred Raskin's editing for making this claustrophobic world even more intimate.The Hateful Eight is far from the director's best work, but it remains skillful filmmaking that shows enough vitality and edginess to overcome its flaws.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,0,14,5 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," A Ice Cold Dark Comedy
","GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A clever bio-pic that purposely mixes fact and fiction.SYNOPSIS: The supposed story of ice skater, Tonya Harding.JIM'S REVIEW: I, Tonya is not your typical biography film. Craig Gillespie solidly directs his movie about the infamous ice skater, Tonya Harding, with a bold conceit, purposely mixing fact and fiction and admitting this premise from the outset. He skates through the hard news facts and avoids conventional storytelling techniques in a refreshing way. The director tends to simplify the story as he adds one part high melodrama and two parts irony to his dark comedy. He does overload the film with 90's pop standards that overstate his message, but he assembles a winning cast of players who act their roles with expert glee and a strong satiric edge. I, Tonya stays on target with its low-trash trashing of America, and having Tonya portrayed as the eternally abused heroine. Perhaps, not the most accurate depiction of this celebrity. The clever screenplay by Steven Rogers uses mock interviews with the actors in character and the supposed 'true' events that led up to the attack on fellow skater, Nancy Kerrigan. The script reinforces this notion with a 'she said-he said' formula which works. The film sets up the story of Ms. Harding's early skating career, her heartless mother, her violent relationship with her husband, her Olympic dreams, and the 'incident' leading to her downfall. It tells its tale effectively but spends too much time blaming those around Tonya as her victimizers and making her more saintly sympathetic than need be. Where the film mostly succeeds is in its sardonic black humor and outlandish characterizations.Margot Robbie, a bit too beautiful for the part, is quite sensational as Tonya. The actress interprets her role very well as abused victim and hard-as-nails survivor. She rarely is shown to be apologetic or kind, usually appears to be temperamental and impetuous, yet Ms. Robbie makes Tonya empathetic and vulnerable. She is excellent throughout the film, her highpoint being her dressing room scene prior to Tonya's disgraceful showing at the Olympics and the film's brutal closing moments. Those alone deserve award attention.Ms. Robbie gets strong support from a fine ensemble that are physically aligned to the real life counterparts and bring a fierce determination to their characters. Sebastian Stan is Jeff Gillooly, her abusive spouse, and he makes this despicable person a dangerous force and troubled soul. His scenes of sudden violence and unpredictable behavior are powerful. Paul Walter Hauser plays Shawn Eckhardt, his half-witted accomplice with delusions of grandeur, and the actor is quite wonderful...funny and yet pitifully tragic. Some of the other roles could use more clarification and depth, but they are graced with talented performers like Julianne Nicholson and Bobby Cannavale who add much to their sketchy parts.But the real scene-stealer is Allison Janney as her cold-hearted mother, . She creates a bitter hateful woman, unloved and unloving, and Ms. Janney, almost unrecognizable, never allows her cruel character to be not the least bit sympathetic or caring with the moviegoing audience. What could easily have been an overdone evil caricature becomes an wildly eccentric character that is, understandably, the main cause-and-effect of Tonya's dysfunction. Her scenes with Ms. Robbie have a bittersweet sadness and a quick comic give-and-take shock value that empowers the film.I, Tonya is a well-made and searing indictment of the rise and fall of one woman and her quest for fame, fortune, and the American Dream. Be careful what you wish for.",8,1,1,28 January 2018
Molly's Game," Poker Face
","GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A hand well played, but not a grand slam.SYNOPSIS: The true story of Molly Bloom and the fast-paced world of gambling.JIM'S REVIEW: Molly's Game is a well directed, well acted, and well written film. Yet I was never emotionally drawn to any of the characters or their situations. Everyone is so into self-gratification and greed that nothing appears remotely real, though it is based on a true story.Jessica Chastain is Molly Bloom and she is perfectly cast and almost makes one care for this controlling and conniving survivor. Her character becomes the mastermind behind many gambling sessions from Los Angeles to New York. Molly uses her business savvy and sexuality to lure many men into her high-stakes card games. Wearing the tightest of dresses and showing off her wares in low cut cleavage revealing outfits, Molly is dressed to kill as she preys upon a rotating group of motley losers ranging from famous egotistic actors, rich businessmen, and Russian thugs. (Kudos to costume designer Susan Lyall.) We meet the many crazy types of rich gamblers and their obsessions with instant thrills in the crazy world of poker. We also learn that Molly is one sharp player who is slowly being corrupted by the high rollers and their expensive habits. This will all lead to her arrest and trial on federal charges. Enter Idris Elba to her rescue as her fast-talking attorney (no one in this movie speaks slowly or at at normal pace).Part of the reason the film mildly disappoints is the film's structure. It jumps from past events (Molly's adolescent years, her rise and fall as an Olympic athlete, her gambling acumen) to her central issue as a gamer who destroys others people's lives in order to earns millions. The flashbacks and forwards tell her autobiographical tale of wealth and corruption, but at the cost of any remote feeling for this rather shallow and selfish person. Much of the film (based on her memoir) seems like a con game for not only the gamblers, hoodlums, and patsies that crisscrossed her life but for the moviegoers too. The real world as depicted in this movie just is too unreal.In his directing debut, Aaron Sorkin tries to keep the action moving and plays up the psychological ramification of this dangerous game but his message becomes heavy-handed and no matter his visual sleight of hand, with all of his fancy editing techniques and wordplay, it cannot hide the film's emptiness of any redeemable characters, including our lead heroine.Mr. Sorkin's screenplay is literate and filled with quick talk and clever conversations, but it never builds to any satisfying conclusion. Scenes are riveting but then jarringly cut to another piece of Molly's life. The effect makes one becomes dizzy with all the exposition and convoluted storytelling. Also, there is a plot contrivance in the third act, that is so far-fetched and melodramatic (although it is well performed by Mr. Costner as Molly's strict father) that I was ready to hold 'em and fold 'em due to the absurdity of the sequence.Another problem script-wise is that the film's colorful supporting characters are introduced, have their big dramatic moments, and then conveniently disappear from the narrative. The film focuses a tad too much on the title character without paying enough homage to its fine supporting cast which includes Bill Camp, Michael Cera, Brian d'Arcy James, Chris O'Dowd, Jeremy Strong, and the aforementioned Mr. Costner. Their strong ensemble work becomes mere second-place footnotes in Molly's non-stop voice-overs.The lead acting, however, is aces. Ms. Chastain greatly impresses with her nuanced performance and her subtle acting choices which show us a strong but damaged character worthy of our attention. Her verbal sparring and rapid banter with Mr. Elba make their film teamwork rather special.The film may not be a grand slam or one of a kind filmmaking, but it deals a somewhat winning hand. Just don't expect to win big when seeing Molly's Game.",Null,4,8,11 January 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Tin Tin Jones to the Rescue
","This film is recommended.The Adventures of Tintin is based on a series of classic comic books created by Georges Remi under the pen name of Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics around the 1930's and had a resurgence of popularity in the mid-fifties, when producers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were avid fans of the series. Their interest resulted in this starry-eyed 3-D adaptation of this fictional hero and his exploits. This animated version of Tintin is an energetic lark. Back then, the stories were humorous adventure tales with a tinge of fantasy that fascinated children with their swashbuckling dare- doings. This film gives the characters a more modern look and realistic edge to the original source with a slight Indiana Jones flavor thrown in for good measure. While the film is not always successful in its trendy mix of state-of-the-art animation with its old-fashion storytelling of yore, it is still a worthwhile experience for children and parents to savor and enjoy. Storywise, the film is a rather routine outing as our hero and his loyal dog, Snowy, go in search of buried treasure. ( The film is based on the first three books from the original series. ) Buying a model of a ship called The Unicorn, Tintin ( Jamie Bell ) encounters Mr. Sakharine ( Daniel Craig ), a baddie who will stop at nothing to find three scrolls that will lead him to wealth and riches. Soon they are all journey bound, along with a drunken Captain Haddock ( Andy Serkis ) and his motley crew, ready for adventure.The screenplay adaptation by Stephen Moffet, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish does a concise if not exciting job with its subject. There is enough fun and thrills provided for the kiddies, although the film's humor is forced and only moderately amusing. In this version as in the original source, Tintin is the serious type. So much of the liveliness comes from the supporting cast, including Inspectors Thompson and Thompson ( Nick Frost and Simon Pegg ). All of the voice-overs provide the needed zest to the animated characters and their dilemmas. Yet, some of the charm has been lost in Spielberg's transition to update Hergé's original illustrations with more photo-realistic qualities, a decision that sometimes detracts rather than enhances the film's endearing characters. The realism of some of the film's characters seems totally artificial and contrived, and the rendering of authentic skin tones becomes considerably overambitious and fussy in its detailing. This results in more attention being given to the impressive technique and craftsmanship and less to the overall appearance of Tintin and his entourage. Many supporting characters are just stylized caricatures with exaggerated profiles and grotesque facial features that are at odds with the film's photo- realism emphasis. There remains an overall plastic vagueness in the film's main character, a blandness that persisted in the human forms of earlier computer generated animated efforts like Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express (2004) and Disney's A Christmas Carol (2009) and here, the character design is only slightly improved. ( Perhaps, the media of animation cannot yet master the realities of live action subjects so easily. )But the film does triumph in its action sequences. The camera's flowing movements and contrasting textures of objects, rather than people, is unparalleled in its artistry. The motion capture technology works more often than not. Shadows and lighting effects produce dramatic results, specifically with reflections found in windows and mirrors. Computer generated vistas of oceans and deserts supply enough local color and their transitions from one scene to the next are seamlessly achieved. The elaborate compositions and unique perspectives make one forget that what is being seen up there on the screen is purely imaginary in its execution. The background details of Hergé's comic book world are quite stunning to behold with certain individual segments generating much wonderment and awe. ( Snowy's car chase, Tintin's motorcycle escape, and the notable pirate sequences are memorable exercises in CGI advancement, skillfully directed by Spielberg and creatively drawn by his talented crew. ) The Adventures of Tintin is a delightful homage to Hergé's much loved classic tale. This film should result in an even wider audience of today's younger generation of moviegoers. We can now appreciate and admire the craft of two artists with their own worldly visions, brought together to create a lovely cinematic treat for this holiday season.

Moana," The Princess and the Sea
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A predictable but lively animated feature with superb visuals  that follow its winning formula all too safely.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: A new Disney Princess arrives to tell her story of self  discovery.  JIM'S REVIEW: Moana, Disney's latest animated offering is more of the  same: lovely visuals, predictable but uplifting story, a peppy music  score, and a heroine you can certainly root for. The formula may be  winning, but, in all honesty, it is a little weary. Now, girl power is  a good thing...don't get me wrong...I just want a little more from this  creative studio. (My expectations are high from their track record.)  Still, this film is entertaining to the max, and the artistry and  creativity involved help to elevate this tale from standard family  fare.   Yes, the Disney Studio knows its way to success. It follows a set  formula that has worked for years: Introduce a modern day princess.  Check. Add feel-god vibes. Check. Bring in a comic sidekick. Check.  Show journey of self-discovery though impressive animation. Check. Mix  in a colorful villain or two. Check. Don't forget some catchy tunes.  Check. All leading to the ultimate happy ending. Well, what do you  think?  The screenplay, by Jared Bush, goes like this: A curse has befallen the  island of Motunui, and Moana, the chief's daughter, is determined to  rectify the ecological imbalance. So she sails off to find a demigod  named Maui to help her. Together they join forces to make the world a  better place. The script refuses to dumb down its plot, but it doesn't  stimulate the mind in its basic conventional set-up. The end result is  a purely visceral movie-going experience due to the high caliber of  artistic excellence on view.   Moana is a visual delight. The computer generated and hand drawn  animation mix well. The details are impressive: Water has a transparent  shimmer; colors glow with an iridescent radiance, varying textures from  sand to wood to leafy vegetation impress, the characters have an  expressive stylized purity. Particularly engaging are Maui's inky  hieroglyphic tattoos that spring to life to tell their own stories.  Special kudos go out to a terrific music score by Mark Mancina that has  the right percussion rhythms of the Polynesian culture and nifty  original songs with clever lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Opetaia  Foa'i that advance the plot.  Along with Dwayne Johnson as the Polynesian demigod, Auli'i Cravalho  voices Moana and they both do some wonderful vocal contributions to the  film. Providing fine vocal support too are Rachel House, Temuera  Morrison, and especially Jermaine Clement, who nearly steals the film  with his show-stopping production number, Shiny, (although the inspired  connection to The Little Mermaid is too obvious). There is also comic  relief in the form of a dim-witted rooster named Helhel, that younger  moviegoers will love.  Moana remains a well-crafted project, beautifully rendered and well  received by both critics and audience members. It is solidly directed  by Ron Clements and John Musker. But the predictability factor does  impair this South Pacific tale and all the wonderful surface treatment  and artistry could not hide its simplistic and familiar narrative. A  feeling of 'been there / done that' does seep into the film's overall  impact. (In a year of glorious entries that brought forth such classic  works like Kubo and the Two Strings and Zootopia, also by the Disney  Studio, who couldn't ask for more of that perfect level of animation  and story?)  Wanting more daring innovation in my animated features is a worthy  goal. So I still look forward to the artisans at Disney Studio and  their next venture. The talent is there, in full force, but the Mouse  Factory needs to stop playing it so safely and find more challenging  projects. Stories that surprise and whet the intellect are not that far  a reach. Call me a cockeyed optimist.  NOTE: There was a tad bit of controversy of the depiction of Maui.  Disney Studios bulked him up from his more recognizable well-toned  physique and critics cried foul of this revamped stereotypical  reincarnation. There are bigger issues in life. Nuff said.",8,1,11,6 December 2016
BlacKkKlansman," A Spike Lee History Lesson
","B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An important film about race relations, then and now.JIM'S REVIEW: Spike Lee's scathing indictment of civil unrest, BlacKkKlansman takes place in another time, the mid-seventies, but it is far from a period drama. Directed with unabashed anger and expert filmmaking skill, this wake-up call to America relates its true story of two undercover cops who infiltrate the KKK to expose their criminal activities. But it doesn't remain lost in the seventies as it equates then to now, both in words, archival footage, and recent contemporary events that pave the way to more disgraceful behavior and moral offenses. (It is no coincidence that the film is being released on the first anniversary of the Charlottesville Virginia protest against white supremacist groups that resulted in 35 injuries and the death of Heather Heyer. That fact becomes part of this epic story too.)The director addresses the prejudice long found in our society through the use of Hollywood early cinema. There is a bit of a disconnect with its prologue, Victor Fleming's 1939's Gone With the Wind (with its iconic shot of Confederate soldiers lay dying on the streets of Atlanta) before the film's central plot begins. As the film progresses, Mr. Lee connects the dots with past sins and present ones. He hurls his rage later on with the inclusion of D.H. Griffith's 1915 Birth of a Nation to maximum effect. Spike Lee's screenplay, co-written by the director and David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Wilmott, chronicles its stranger-than-fiction tale of a black rookie police officer, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), and his personal awakening to 'white hate'. His on-the-job experience leads him to a meeting of two extremist groups, Black Power activists and the Knights of Ku Klux Klan. Going undercover with the former group is no problem for Ron, but he must enlist the aid of a white Jewish officer, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to take over his identity in order to impersonate him and insinuate himself into the latter group. All this leads up to a meeting with Grand Wizard David Dukes (Topher Grace) and exposing these abhorrent hate-mongers and their terrorism. Mr. Lee's films always are concerned with righting wrongs. Unafraid to call out racial prejudice, xenophobia, anti-semitism, and homophobia, his cinematic statements (or as he calls them 'joints') deal with current issues and our continued repeating of past mistakes. Some critics call it propaganda, I call it passion and a voice to be heard. This is grandiose filmmaking, ambitious in its epic undertaking and overstuffed with multiple storylines and stark imagery. In fact, Mr. Lee does take some liberties with actual facts in the real life events of Det. Stallworth's story and his tone of the film shifts dramatically in its mood swing into occasionally dark satire to convey the irony and cruelty of the human condition. Borderline outrageous, the chain of events almost becomes a crazy quilt of America's bigotry with images and narrative absurdly colliding against each other, resembling a dated blaxploitation movie of that era. The film is manipulative and heavy-handed in some portions, but it is mostly powerful and disturbing in its content.He cast his film with actors who are so physical right for their roles which gives an immediate authenticity to the film. Laura Harrier, Ryan Eggold, Paul Walter Hauser, Corey Hawkins,, Nicholas Turturro, and Harry Belafonte are especially fine in their parts. Most effective are Mr. Grace as the KKK leader, Jasper Pääkkönen as one of his henchman and Ashlie Atkinson who plays his white supremacist wife, Connie, delivering the menace and bile extremely well. But the core of the film is the relationship between the two detectives and both Mr. Washington and Mr. Driver are excellent. They imbue a real chemistry together. Alec Baldwin brings strong support playing against type in a role that forms a fascinating paradox with his common persona.There are major set pieces that impress with the director's free-ranging style. Very notable is his trademark crosscutting of contrasting scenes with the Klansmen and their families viewing the Griffith film in rapturous attention and chanting 'white power' while in another part of the city, black students listen in awe to a lecture about the senseless murder of an innocent black man as they shout 'black power'. The variance between the two groups is startling. Never one to shy away from making a political statement or two, Mr. Lee uses intense documentary imagery in his film's climax to hold our president personally responsible for the hatred and polarized climate in our splintered nation.Production values are strong throughout with special mention to Chayse Irvin's lush cinematography and Barry Alexander Brown's skillful editing. Terrence Blanchard provides the musical soundtrack with carefully selected songs of the era to comment on and advance the action.BlackkKlansman is an important film that needs to be seen and heard. It uses historical fact-based incidents in its savage exposé of racial intolerance. It is one of Mr. Lee's finest achievements and one of the year's best films.And, yes, despite (or because of) the blind ignorance of the 2013 Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling stripping away key elements of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and our present-day 45th United States political leader's sanctioned bigotry, racism is still alive and doing quite well.",9,10,22,12 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Webmaster
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A superhero movie that does not take itself so seriously and benefits from its off-beat humor and winning cast.SYNOPSIS: The Spiderman saga retold, with a new cast of heroes and villains. JIM'S REVIEW: I am just soooo tire of comic book superhero movies! They usually follow the same by-the-numbers formula (hero gets superpowers, hero learns how to use those powers effectively, hero fight diabolical super villain, hero saves the world...end of story...that is, until the next installment.) Neither the superhero (or their filmmakers) have much courage to go outside of the lines and be halfway original or clever. (Yes, there have been some recent entries that have actually shown some creativity, Doctor Strange, Logan, and Wonder Woman being three fine examples, but those films are rarities in this lost in translation genre.) ￼Which brings us to the latest superhero saga, Spiderman: Homecoming, the third incarnation of this Marvel series crusader. Now, let's make that four!While there are some flaws to its storytelling, the film has much to admire. It still suffers from much of that 'same sameness' that I previously mentioned...the perfunctory plot structure, temporary mishaps that befall any superhero, an overabundance of set action pieces that rely too heavily on CGI...Spiderman: Homecoming falls into those traps but also adds some nice bits of originality along the way. (It even tries a plot twist that did not surprise me, but (from the audience reaction) worked very successfully on most of the moviegoers around me.) ￼So what makes this so much more watchable than most of this ilk? Some positive factors are:1. a gawky superhero that actually acts his chronological age of 15 years old (but still looks slightly older, more like 16 going on 17) 2. a wonderful wry sense of humor that frequently works, with enough insider jokes to placate the fanboys and others 3. a sympathetic villain (well played by Michael Keaton) that is not into world domination, but more into protesting the working class struggle 4. as written, a character in which an actor plays up the teenage novice angle and dwells less of the mighty hero fixationWearing that famous red and blue spandex outfit now is Tom Holland. (Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garland have previously played the role with much success in previous movies.) Mr. Holland has youth and inexperience on his side and he uses his ah-shucks demeanor and rushed nasal voice to make Peter Parker a more complex and real teenager filled with all the angst and problems of peer pressure that gives most adolescent moviegoers the ability to relate. Mr. Holland brings authenticity to his character and a goofy awkwardness that helps us automatically suspend belief and buy into the standard mechanics of a plot that does meander.Then, who does one root for, the semi-evil Vulture or our feisty webmaster? Klutzy teenager vs. criminal mastermind? Both characters are equal adversaries in this version and the actors bring nuance to their roles, which elevates the film tremendously.Director John Watts wisely concentrates on the human drama behind the masks. He takes the time to establish the villain's motives and makes him less of a cartoon nemesis. He focuses on our hero, the nerd, coming to terms with his new image while gaining self confidence and inner strength, although the ineptness issues do go on a bit too long. Yet that story is actually more interesting than the many overblown set action pieces of CGI technology. These action scenes do hold one's interest, even if the proportions of Spidey and his surroundings, the less than ideal staging, and close-up blurry movement blunts the impact. The side story about Spiderman joining forces with the Avengers crew may interest some loyal comic book fans but that angle simply bored me. (The best sequence in the film, by far, is peril on the Staten Island Ferry; the weakest being the climactic fight scene.)￼Some other filmmaking decisions that paid off: Love interest? A little, but more time is spent on the bromance between Peter and his buddy, Ned (Jacob Batalon, a strong casting choice, playing against stereotype most effectively). Fortunately there is also less exposition spent about Spiderman's origins and background, although Marissa Tomei as his Aunt May provides a warm addition to the cast. Also contributing fine support is Jon Favareu, Zendaya, Laura Harrier, and Robert Downey, Jr. as you-know-who.Spiderman: Homecoming is a delightfully entertaining comic book blockbuster that knows its source well enough to bust through the tired clichés that entrap most other superhero films. It uses its smart sense of humor to win you over and comes up a real winner.",8,1,4,12 July 2017
Begin Again," Sing a Song of Love
","This film is recommended. Its title is doesn't say much, almost seeming like a sweet afterthought but a necessary means of identification without any real meaning. That too sums up the movie, Begin Again. This low- budget independent film charts the meeting of two mismatched lovers who never appear to be soul-mates. It's as if their only connection is the song, which also is the only driving force in this semi-love story.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) is a washed-up music producer whose life has seen better times. He is estranged from his wife and teenage daughter. Gretta (Keira Knightley) is a soulful songwriter, newly heart-broken by her recent break-up with her successful musician boyfriend. Dan and Gretta meet and join forces to record a live musical album. They begin to bond and sort out their personal demons.Begin Again tries to avoid predictability at all cost, but its non-predictability becomes its main calling card. The film has a nice soundtrack, filled with lovely original music. (Especially memorable is its theme song, Lost Stars.) Were that its screenplay had the same insight and passion. The script by the director, Jim Carney (Once), lightly touches on some character development but rarely delves deeply with their self-destructive behavior or dramatic situations: Dan drinks heavily and behaves erratically, but has that special gift of spotting new talent. Gretta lacks confidence and doubts herself as a performer, never wanting to 'sell-out'. As written, both characters remain sketchy and come to terms with their issues matter-of-factly. Begin Again relies heavily on the actors to supply the missing ingredients. Fortunately, Carney has cast his film with top talent. There is an underlying chemistry with Knightly and Ruffalo. The actors bring the needed believability to their roles. It is in the film's quieter moments that their relationship shines, words not said, the actors' pauses and subtle stares, their boding during the film's improvisational musical scenes. This is where the film connects with the audience. (Ms. Knightley does some fine vocalizing too.) Strong support is also given by James Corden, Hailee Steinfeld, Cathleen Keener, and Adam Levine.Can a Song Save Your Life? was the original title of the film. Perhaps a more apt name could have been Can a Song Save Your Movie? The answer is yes, especially with its two charismatic leads serenading moviegoers. Begin Again is worth a listen.

Horrible Bosses," How to Misdeed in Business Without Really Dying
","This film is mildly recommended.Factories throughout our nations are closing at an alarming rate. So it's really no shock that the Hollywood Dream Factory has closed shop too. Now the dream merchants have become the ultimate recycling machine. Today, new and original ideas are rarities. Evidence can be found on any movie screen. Hollywood just tweaks another successful formula from umpteen moneymaking properties it has in its unending supply, renames and repackages it, and sends it out to thousands of movie screens in hopes of cashing in.Horrible Bosses follows that studio system fairly closely. On the heels of The Hangover ( a trio of raunchy friends placed into harebrained situations ), borrowing the premise of 9 to 5 and Office Space ( taking care of the nasty boss ) and Strangers on a Train ( a plot to kill off an unlikeable adversary ), with a nod to the dark side mentality of Ruthless People or Throw Momma Off the Train, this latest effort borrows heavily from these tried and true old chestnuts to remake a newbie of sorts. Nick ( Jason Bateman ), Dale ( Charlie Day ) and Kurt ( Jason Sudeikis ) are three friends all plagued with supervisors from hell. Kurt deals with a smug and arrogant boss ( Kevin Spacey ). Dale has the misfortune to be cougar bait for his employer, Dr. Julia Harris ( Jennifer Aniston ). Kurt works under a dysfunctional and coked-up Mr. Pellit (an almost unrecognizable and underused Colin Farrell ). A plan is hatched with the aid of a shady character named Dean Motherf**ker Jones (Jamie Foxx) to make their business life a shade happier.Horrible Bosses is the perfect vehicle for those suffering from ODD ( Oppositional Defiance Disorder ). It reaches out to those who have ever suffered any indignities in the workplace. The film taps into the frustrations and insecurities of the white collar employee mindset and our bouts with management, administrators, and executives who have climbed that Peter Principle ladder to success rung by wrong. The audience automatically sides for the hapless trio and roots for the misdeeds to happen to the evil head honchos. That's the set-up, but the pay-off has some glitches.While the film lacks originality, it does have a slightly clever script by Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, and Jonathan M. Goldstein. The film has its share of one-liners and zingers that provide a higher percentage of laughs than most comedies of this genre. Some of the jokes do fall flat, but the majority work. The film's director, Seth Gordon, paces his film well and set just the right tone needed for the weird shenanigans to occur. The humor is character driven, that is, once the sit-com aspects have been thoroughly established, although it takes awhile to start incorporating the murder plot into the mix. Most of the hilarity is largely due to its talented cast of gifted performers that bring more laughs in their execution of this farce. The over-the-top antics of the actors are funny and their expert timing with this material is showcased to their comic best. As the three stooge- like friends, Bateman plays the put-upon straight man role with his usual self assurance, Day has some nice physical shtick ( although his whiny and shrill voice gets to be a bit annoying in crisis mode ), and Sudeikis fills the horn dog friend role with flair. Especially strong are the more showier roles of the mean spirited bosses, Spacey and Aniston in particular. All of the bosses border on caricature, yet are outrageous enough to thoroughly admire their wickedness while totally disliking their personas. As the film progresses, Horrible Bosses takes an absurdist turn with its plot, giving it a few zanier moments with some silly slapstick thrown in for good measure. Regretfully, this entertaining film falters into sit-com territory by the end. If the script would have become more sarcastic and celebrated the horribleness of its unredeemed characters, Horrible Bosses would have become a more effective comedy. But the film seems content to play it safe when a real leap into the darker side would have been a better alternative, and worthy of a well- earned promotion.

Black Mass," Smooth Criminal
","(Rating: ☆☆☆½ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: A standard gangster film that goes above the standard due to a star performance and some fine filmmaking.GRADE: B+In Black Mass, Scott Cooper's chilling biography of psychotic killer, James 'Whitey' Bulger, we follow a bloody trail of gruesome murders and assorted mayhem on the road to his notoriety. The film chronicles Burger's life and killing sprees, from his beginnings as a small-time thug in South Boston to becoming a dangerous mob leader and F.B.I. informant. Johnny Depp plays this central role and he is brilliant (but more on that later) and the film's other cast members are just terrific too.￼Crime may not pay, but it sure earned Burger a nice living, before being apprehended after 30+ years of being a career criminal, even using the F.B.I. to help his meteoric rise to the Most Wanted list. The screenplay by Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk is so well written and researched. Their script focuses on the personal side of Bulger, with his Irish family ties, particularly his close relationship with his Senator brother (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his childhood friendship with F.B.I. agent, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). It also solidly interweaves his business dealings with other partners-in-crime. Dialog has a natural rhythm and all of the characters, both major and minor, are fully developed. ￼The director creates a realistic world of criminals and lowlifes. Although the story has a been-there-done-that feel and is too derivative of other gangster films, Cooper's vision is fresh and detail-oriented. Scenes bristle with tension and shocking violence, some merely suggested off-camera; others shown in grisly close-ups. (Be forewarned: The film is extremely gruesome.) He has assembled a top-notch ensemble that inhabit these indelible characters in many memorable moments. ￼This is, by far, one of the year's best acted films of the year. Delivering a break-out performance is the aforementioned Mr. Edgerton as the ambitious and easily corrupted agent and friend, hell-bent on making a professional career at the bureau and using Bulger as any means to accomplish that goal. Benedict Cumberbatch as Burger's loving brother shows his character's range of compassion in his few short scenes. Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, and Peter Saragaard as Bulger's cronies are excellent. Giving strong support in smaller roles are Dakota Johnson as Bulger's girlfriend, Juno Temple as an unfortunate prostitute, Kevin Bacon, Corey Stoll, Adam Scott, and David Harbour as F.B.I. agents, the latter encapsulates a good man caught in the web of corruption. Julianne Nicholson is superb as Connolly's wife, whose uncomfortable and noticeable dislike for Bulger leads to a confrontation scene with Depp that is totally mesmerizing.￼But it is Mr. Depp who is a marvel of nuanced acting, so unlike his work in these past years. (One forgets his keen ability and talent as an actor with such debacles as The Lone Ranger, Into the Woods, Transcendence, Dark Shadows, The Tourist, so fresh in one's mind...need I go on.) In this film, his portrayal is more than a mere physical transformation with Depp's icy-blue eyes (contacts) matching his ice-cold bloodlessness. (If the eyes are the window to the soul, this ultimately leads to a man devoid of any humanity.) The actor's mannerisms, posturing, and unflinching stares communicate more than his character's hollow and insincere words. He oozes a creepiness with his balding skeletal facial expressions and exudes menace from every pore. His line delivery is deliberately flippant at times, and other times, hesitant with every calculated pause. He plays Bulger as a predator in search of any victim, trusting no one. It's an Oscar worthy performance.￼Black Mass also has wonderful production values. The make-up and prosthetic work on Mr. Depp makes the actor unrecognizable, and while he does not truly resemble the real criminal, he makes this character a terrifying and totally riveting monster. The atmospheric cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi's and concise editing by David Rosenbloom make the film more compelling than most from this genre. There is fine period art direction and costumes by Jeremy Woodward and Kasia Walicka-Maimone, respectively. And Junkie XL's musical score heightens the suspense quite effectively.￼Despite its conventional narrative structure, Black Mass is one of the best films of the year. Cooper and Depp bring new blood to the old aging gangster genre, even if the blood flows in buckets.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9,1,8,24 September 2015
Suicide Squad," Bad Company
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Another sci-fi superhero fantasy that follows the formula alright but just isn't super.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: A band of rowdy misfits battle evil forces.JIM'S REVIEW: Bad is good. Let me re-phrase that...bad is kinda good. David Ayer's well-made but dull Suicide Squad is essentially a war film with 'flying men and monsters', including a wicked woman who is 'a whole lotta of pretty and a whole lot of ugly'. There is a lot of chaos on screen, but most can be found in the film's muddle of a script. Its characters are 'bad to the bone', but so is the weak screenplay.Is it as bad as most critics are saying? No...absolutely not, but it is not as good as it could have been. With a better script and a better villain (more on that later), the film could have been an all-out hit. The backstories of these misfits are the most entertaining parts of the film and Mr. Ayer's introduction of these personalities is concise and affecting. But his action sequences generally disappoint, with sub-par CGI and in-your-face rootin'-tootin' shoot-outs and gunfire, the kind of violence without consequences. Some of the jokes between the killer crew land, most don't. Much destruction and mayhem is present without the blood splatter and body count. (Still, the film's PG-13 rating is highly questionable.) The film also has little originality. It's more piecemeal of other films of this genre; some good (The Avengers series, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ghostbusters) and some bad (Sucker Punch, Green Lantern, Fantastic Four). It takes a worn-out premise from westerns (The Magnificent Seven, The Hateful Eight) and war films (The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds, the director's very own, Fury) of assembling a rowdy bunch of bad-asses to do the dirty work and save the world.Still the director continues to be a promising talent. (His 2014 film, Fury, made my Top Ten list for that year. It was a superior film with strong performances and excellent production values.) However, this offering lacks the latter but does have the former. Fortunately, Mr. Ayer has cast his film very well. So let's talk about some of the film's assets, primarily the four lead actors' performances. Will Smith as Deadshot, a hit man with perfect aim, aims perfectly with his character and gives one of his best and most believable performances in a long while. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, a mercenary soldier in charge of the squad, brings gravitas and vulnerability to his character. Viola Davis delivers the menace in large portions. But the real scene-stealer is Margot Robbie as the deranged Harley Quinn, a Kewpie doll who packs a wallop. Her acting has great nuance and she underplays the hammiest of lines. This just may be the breakout role the actress needs to become a big star and she is electric, the perfect fanboy fantasy. (This gifted actress is making a nice resume with her role choices.) The problem with Suicide Squad is the rest of the pack aren't that interesting and are sketchy and poorly drawn (again, the fault of the script). The actors in these parts are good enough, especially Jay Hernandez as the fiery conflicted Diablo, and an underused Jared Leto as The Joker. Yet the other characters, as written, are largely forgettable: Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). The balancing act of bringing all of these marauders together becomes a jumble of forced equal screen time. Less would have been more.Beside a sub-standard screenplay (written by the director himself), the other major hurdle is the film's villain entitled The Enchantress, a laughable Mati Hari-type vixen that shimmies and gyrates and may radiate powerful gamma rays but displays no conflict or personality, let alone posing as a real threat. Without a real baddie at the center of the turmoil, the film has no sense of jeopardy or tension. The actress playing her, Cara Delevingne, rarely enchants, but she does keep a straight face throughout the film so that alone is a credit to her profession.Suicide Squad is not quite dead on arrival, as most reviewers might have you think. Due to some fine acting and some of Mr. Ayer's images, it does have a steady pulse.",7,8,12,6 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain Crunch
","This film is mildly recommended. Wham! Bam! Pow! Like a Lichtenstein print, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is standard pop entertainment. This sequel unwisely underplays the standard fish-out-of- water scenario that gave its first installment some distinction and comic flair. In this version, humor is scant and the story is still rather predictably bland, but as for superhero thrills and action sequences, those are in abundance. The film may be slightly improved in its second go-round due to some strong CGI and well staged set pieces, but whenever the action lulls, so does its enjoyment. ￼ The wobbly plot goes something like this: Our hero, Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America must again fight the forces of evil, this time in the form of a Soviet assassin named the Winter Soldier. There is treachery and disloyalty within the SHIELD agency that can compromise national security as Captain America tries to unravel the mystery and save the day.￼I have to confess most of the Marvel comic book heroes are usually a boring lot, but the franchise certainly knows how to cast its actors in those coveted roles: Robert Downey, Jr. as Ironman, High Jackman as Wolverine, Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, and Chris Evans in this titled role. Evans more than looks the part, especially out of his costume, and the actor brings to his part a sweet charm and quiet strength. His interplay with his co-star, Scarlett Johansson, as Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, make the film and its characters all the more interesting. Samuel L. Jackson, Anthony Mackie, and Sebastian Stan are fine in their colorful supporting roles, and it is an added pleasure seeing Robert Redford chewing up the scenery in his pivotal role.￼But the film's plot lacks cohesiveness. It continually tries to explain itself and the characters' actions in clunky dialog and heavy-handed exposition in between all the crash-and-boom, shoot-em-up scenes. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo certainly know how to stage the film's many action shots. Along with the strong visual effects, the stunt-work is top notch and extremely well choreographed. But the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely disappoints. Characters are in need of more depth and the plot mechanics never flow or connect with the action. ￼Captain America: The Winter Soldier abruptly stops and starts. The film clumsily lurches from one scene to the next. One can readily say that the film's pacing stops on a quarter. This comic book superhero movie takes itself way too seriously and should have used its super powers to have a lot more fun with its source. Captain America: The Winter Soldier just left me a tad cold. GRADE: B-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,3,7,13 April 2014
Life of Pi," Life of Pawn
","This film is mildly recommended. Give me the real thing anytime! Sparkling rhinestones never trump diamonds. Plastic trees and silk flowers can never substitute for nature's glories. Artificial sweeteners are fine for awhile, but usually leave a funny aftertaste. Which brings us to Ang Lee's Life of Pi, a so-so entertainment that is long on style and short in substantial value.Overdone best describes this film. Visually, the film is a stunning work of art. ( I found the 3-D to be totally enthralling, almost too precise and overworked at times, but still a remarkable undertaking of this process. ) The film's color palette has an exciting vibrancy that is unmatched by other films, but also an artificial over-saturated glow, as if colors were boosted beyond their limits. There are scenes of true artistry that give this film a distinctive allure ( the staging of the actual shipwreck sequence, the surprise meeting of the boy and his tiger aboard the small lifeboat, a surrealistic hallucination that is filled with stark imagery, the colorful sunsets and ominous cloud reflecting upon the waters ). These effects do create an otherworldly atmosphere, which I suppose was Lee's goal, but the film's onslaught of phantasmagoric dreamscapes becomes excessive and outweighs the slenderest of plots: a philosophical and spiritual parable about a boy and his tiger lost at sea. This paradoxic metaphor is the basis conceit that enables the director and his screenwriter to explore the deeper meaning of religion, faith, and God that, in the end, makes Life of Pi become a preachy treacle, continually musing about our existence in this vast universe. ( Recent films by major directors like Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life, Lars van Trier's Melancholia, and the recent Cloud Atlas by the Wachowskis have explored this territory with similar mixed results. So one cannot fault Ang Lee with his passion and determination to film this novel and its metaphysical ruminations. ) Ultimately where Lee's film fails is in its conventional storytelling. The screenplay literally sinks the movie. Its script by David Magee rambles on and is especially slow-moving in the first half hour of the film with all its tedious exposition and build-up prior to the shipwreck. Based on Yann Martel's novel, the plot set-up is told in flashback, with the adult Pi bookending the more exciting adventure storyline. As he narrates his tale of survival, the character of the younger Pi ( Suraj Sharma ) emerges, but he is never fully realized. He is merely a pawn in this sea of woe. More time and success is spent on the exquisite photo-realistic rendering of Bengal tiger nicknamed Richard Parker. The CGI enhanced Mr. Parker gives a more lifelike performance and upstages the real life actor, Mr. Sharma, who could use some acting lessons. This imbalance sacrifices a real emotional gravitas needed to really care about the central character which I found completely missing in the film. ( In fact, the tiger had a lot more patience that I would have had if I was on that lifeboat and had to subject myself to Pi's religious rants and whining. He clearly would have been dinner by midday. ) Life of Pi is slightly adrift, a film full of excesses and self-important swagger. Lee overindulges his vision and seems more preoccupied in creating an ethereal world that is quite beautiful and strange to behold but, contrary to his own beliefs, it is also quite annoying to experience all of its religious dogma too. The overall effect of Life of Pi is a mixed blessing, so to speak. Life of Pi is a visually impressive achievement in filmmaking, but it remains intellectually and emotionally off-course. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Years ago, there was a wonderful film based on a children's novel called The Black Stallion which followed a similar storyline: a boy and an animal are shipwrecked and need each other to survive the hardships they face together. That film used a visual, almost wordless narrative to connect story and imagery; this film relies too heavily on the imagery to connect the pretentiousness of its hollow and holiest of words.",7,4,8,28 November 2012
Doctor Strange," Strangely Hypnotic
","Dr. Strange (RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Stunning visuals elevate a good film to an excellent one.   GRADE: B+  SYNOPSIS: After a serious accident, an arrogant surgeon discovers a  much greater power on his road to recovery.  JIM'S REVIEW: Trippy! Far-out! Rad! Cool, dude! These dated expressions  of awe serve a purpose in describing the latest heady concoction known  from the Marvel factory, Dr. Strange.  Fate creates the man...the man being Dr. Stephen Strange (played to the  hilt by Benjamin Cumberbatch). Strange is an egotistical gifted surgeon  who befalls a serious car accident and seeks help on a more mystical  bent. Traveling to Nepal he meets Mordo, a trusty guide on his road to  find out. (Chiwetel Ejiofor, another talented actor who deserves a more  challenging role but still offers much class to his role.) Our hero  eventually connects with The Ancient One (a racially miscast but quite  enjoyable Tilda Swinton) for enlightenment of the mystic kind. This  oracle shows him the ins and outs of magic and healing while imparting  him superpowers and mind-game control (plus a nifty Cloak of  Levitation) to fight evil forces (with the help of terrific  state-of-the-art CGI).  Our superhero's journey to self-discovery takes over the majority of  the screen time before he does fly into kung-fu combat, as most Marvel  heroes do, following the formula of most action fantasies. His nemesis  is a worthy villain, Kaecilius (nicely played by Mads Mikkelsen), a  convert of The Ancient One who has conveniently gone off to the dark  side. The screenplay by C. Robert Cargill, Jon Spaihts, and the  director tries to keep predictability at a minimum and doesn't always  succeed, but he does develop his characters well with enough depth  without sacrificing the adrenaline rush that we has been accustomed to  expect from this genre.  While the film is continually creative and imaginative, it lacks some  originality in its story and visuals, owing other sci-fi predecessors,  specifically The Matrix Trilogy and Inception, big time, but director  Scott Derrickson masters his film's visuals astutely. There is much  eye-candy to behold and the action is non-stop thrilling. Probably no  more spectacular than a memorable soon-to-be-classic set piece  involving mirror images and buildings that effortlessly folding under  each other. This phantasmagorical origami lesson is a kaleidoscopic  marvel of CGI inventiveness. (M.C. Escher would be proud of this visual  op art of suspended architecture and other worldly structures on the  move. Even Hieronymus Bosch would smile wryly at the surrealism hinted  at elsewhere on display. The look of the film is truly a thing of  beauty. (See this movie in the IMAX 3-D format, if possible, for total  immersion.)  Benedict Wong and Rachel MacAdams offer fine support in minor roles.  But it is the strong production values that had this moviegoer  transfixed throughout this blockbuster pop entertainment spectacle. The  film is a remarkable technological achievement, a instant classic and  one of the best comic book superhero films ever. It wisely allows  strong character development, a clever narrative, and stunning action  sequences to merge effortlessly.  Marvel Studio's Dr. Strange does live up to its moniker. It is just  that...strangely hypnotic and a visceral marvel. Go see it.",9,2,6,8 November 2016
Interstellar," Black Hole
","This film is not recommended.Interstellar must be renamed to 2015: A Space Oddity. Once there is lift-off, there is much gravitas and solemn beauty in its weightless universe, even if the film bogs down whenever it tethers itself to Earth, its inhabitants, and their on-going battle with global change. (Yes, you naysayers, it was real!) ￼ The film owes its whole existence to the granddaddy of all space exploration films, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Interstellar is similar in its alignment to scientific probabilities, quantum physics, and algorithms with much talk about wormholes, black holes, time travel, and anomalies. The further connection to Kubrick's masterpiece is even more evident with the episodic nature in Interstellar's plot structure, its minimal in character development (except for its lead character), and its overtly pretentious and sanctimonious tone.More odd in its dramatic flourishes than needed, Nolan's film reaches for the heavens but never soars to any level of greatness. The film is earnest, well-crafted, and stylishly directed, but hardly emotionally involving. Blame the overstuffed script (by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan) for the lack of any real tension or satisfaction. Sections of the film just never gel, leading to an ending that is visually stunning and total nonsense. ￼ The film also owes some of its technical prowess to last year's Gravity in its overall visual look. (That film did it all so much better.) Still the visuals are Interstellar's chief asset (with a dazzling set piece set in the fourth dimension that is especially dazzling in the IMAX format). This film is a long-drawn-out sci-fi fantasy, a seriously-minded adventure film that is takes itself too seriously with scientific exposition and high-brow poetic pause that make the film too solemn and corny to truly enjoy. ￼ Now, let's discuss the story and characters a bit. It is the future and Earth is a dustbin with its population dwindling. Our only hope is what lies above. A team of astronauts is assembled to find another world from three other planets in another galaxy on which we can co-habitat. Leading this crew is a man who must have the right stuff, aptly named Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey. Coop is a widow raising two small children and obsessing with enough pangs of patriarchal guilt and crying jags to possibly earn another Oscar. Sent by old school scientist Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), who is receiving a weak signal from outer space, he bids adieu to his young wards to go space-ward, leaving the coop and his smart daughter Murph (MacKenzie Foy) and older son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) behind in order to help mankind and save his family from an ultimate death. Time passes quickly for these earthlings (and all too slowly for the audience) as 23 years pass and Murph and Tom have grown up, becoming Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck while Coop stays forever young.￼Of course, there will be snags in this mission. Pardon the pun: it's Murphy's Law. Also on board are other space travelers: Dr. Brand's daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway) who acts more Bedelia than Earhart, a nondescript Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi) as the token African-American astronaut and one of the few minorities on screen. Off they go on their spacecraft named Endurance, an apt title indeed! ￼ The acting is barely adequate and well, under stellar. The characters barely register as real people as they continually wax philosophically about life, physics, love, mathematics, and the pursuit of happiness. Their dialogues never resemble anything remotely convincing. Again, the screenplay's poor plotting and weak characterizations aborts their mission. With Interstellar, the sum of its parts are greater than the whole (or hole). In fact, there seem to be an overabundance of holes in Interstellar: black holes, wormholes, and plot holes, the latter being the most dangerous and unavoidable one due to the Brothers Nolans' sappy screenplay. The episodic structure of the film is unable to connect its story lines to make any logical sense. Nolan's film is a major disappointment. In retrospect, perhaps an even better name for Interstellar might be Close Encounters of the Third Rate Kind. At times, the film is a visual pleasure, fitfully entertaining and thought-provoking in its overall production design. But more often, Interstellar is just dull, uninspiring, and a long, long journey into that good night.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Great Film about Anger and Grief
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: A- THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Three of the year's best performances in one of the year's best films.SYNOPSIS: A grieving mother angers a town in order to seek justice for her daughter's unsolved murder.JIM'S REVIEW: When one glances at Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), it is hard to ever imagine if this woman ever danced, or smiled, or loved someone. One wonders if she ever was an innocent child growing up. Her constant scowl, disdaining look, and furrowed brow, are all evident from a lifetime of disappointments which show us that here is a most unhappy person.￼But her appearance tells a deeper story... a tragic tale that gives her permission to be filled with hopelessness and a justifiable reason for her rage. Seven months ago, her daughter was raped and savagely murdered and her killer still remains at large. Justice has not been served and now she must intervene in Martin McDonagh's dark comedy, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Leasing a trio of outdoor displays, she will force local law enforcement into solving her daughter's killing by announcing their ineptitude and shaming the town in the process as the situation becomes even more violent as the investigation spins out of control. The film is superb.￼Just as the morning fog rolls in like a shroud of ominous foreboding, so does a nagging sense of dread and melancholia which seems to hang onto this town and its inhabitants. Mr. McDonagh serves as director and screenwriter and has created a work of art. He deftly directs his own screenplay with masterful results, blending humor and dramatic tension seamlessly. The director / screenwriter's unique and slightly quirky vision fills his film with poetic images (a teddy bear slightly submerged by a riverbank, a deserted set of red swings gently moving in the breeze, a box turtle crawling over a sleeping woman, three disintegrated billboard alongside an empty road). His dialog is hauntingly real and filled with confrontational conversations and barbed words. There are scenes of unexpected poignancy (one between Ms. M. and a passing deer near those controversial billboards and another involving a conversation between pink bunny slippers that are heartbreaking) Each and every character, from major to minor, are fully drawn and react with complete honesty and quiet (and sometimes loud) rage.The casting is flawless. Frances McDormand is a commanding presence and makes an indelible impression as a woman on the verge. Overcome with bitterness and grief, she dominates this film with a no-holds-bar persona. The actress plays this unlikable but passionate character with a vengeance, literally speaking. She is simply astonishing. Her portrayal is a master class in acting. Even when not ranting against the powers that be or fighting to simply be heard, Mildred's silent pauses and side glances fill in all of the nuances of her character's emotional breakdown to chilling effects. (If there is any justice, on screen or off, the Oscar is waiting for her.)As Mildred's moving targets are Woody Harrelson who brings a nuanced portrayal as William Willoughby, the chief of police and Sam Rockwell playing his dim-witted, loyal, and anger-ridden deputy, Officer Dixon. Mr. Harrelson plays the film's most centered character in a town filled with hate and bigotry and the actor conveys a good man dying of cancer, frustrated by life's limitations and caught in a free fall of emotions. Mr. Rockwell takes his complicated character into areas of comedy and drama that defy description. It is a commanding performance as we watch his character grow from a bigoted mama's boy into a man finally questioning his own self-worth. (Another possible award winning performance in a film filled with great acting?) Adding even more depth to the complex plotting are Lucas Hedge as Mildred's forgotten and emotionally trampled son, Robbie, and John Hawkes as her abusive ex-husband. Only Peter Dinklage's character is a tad sketchy and in need of more screen time. He becomes her possible love interest...if Mildred could possibly love anyone. Providing fine support in minor but pivotal roles are Zeljko Ivanek, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Clarke Peters, and Samara Weaving.Production values are high. Beautifully filmed by cinematographer Ben Davis, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. uses a variety of musical genres, from opera and pop standards to twangy country tunes, which set that perfect tone in Carter Burwell's atmospheric score. Both words and image create a shattering look at grief that is unmistakably heart-wrenching.Yes, there are some illogical plot twists and sudden far-fetched acts of violence that never have any legal repercussion on the culprits in this community of law and disorder. But the script has such a lyrical and moving way of expressing the everyday sadness and routine of life that is so commonplace in many rural towns. Some moviegoers also may not be satisfied with the film's conclusion either. But I was transfixed throughout this film. It is hard to imagine another film this year that is so well conceived and executed in its narrative storytelling, sensitive direction, and its glorious acting.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the year's best.",10,6,13,25 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Overloaded Sci-Fi Finale
","GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Technically strong and still entertaining, but an inconsistent storytelling and too many secondary characters overload J.J. Abram's sci-fi epic conclusion.JIM'S REVIEW: All good things must come to an end. And such is the case of the last chapter in the Star Wars saga. Let me begin by saying that this reviewer is not a die-hard fan. I enjoyed the series until the midway point, or should I say more exactly, I lost interest with the beginning chapters and some of their solo ventures. Yes, the CGI greatly improved, but the stories in this franchise fell to the wayside, as did the charm and originality. And, I do need a strong narrative to be enthralled.Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is this ninth (and final?) chapter and it is again put in the more-than-capable hands of director / writer J.J. Abrams. We quickly pick up where we left off: It's Good vs. Evil. Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron are now our trio of Resistance crusader substitutes. (Our original heroes have inhabited an otherworldly state: Luke and Hans have left our mortal coils, and only Leia (Carrie Fisher, in a posthumous performance) remains to offer advice and wisdom in fighting the Stormtroopers and the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca is still around here for companionship as are our favorite droids, R2D2 and C-3PO.) Darth Vader has since perished, but Kylo Rey has taken over his lightsaber. Along with Emperor Palpatine, the battles continue as all are in search of a Sith wayfinder device. (It's the MacGuffin.)The script by Chris Terrio and the director has some continuity issues in the film's editing and storytelling as it jumps from one peril to another, leaving some action and characters unexplained. More character development is needed to build tension and convincing interplay. In this episode, there are no clever one-liners with much of the dialog being merely exposition. The writers seem to take the story all too seriously. Their sense of humor is lost in space and in short supply with this final chapter.As both writer and director, Mr. Abrams tries to wrap up all the minutiae and sub-plots to meet fan's expectations and that in itself is a Herculean task. (It's a cast of thousands and, at times, I felt that I needed a map, unlike most of the Star War fanbase. For me, the plot was too complicated for its own good. After all, it's the video game mindset that makes this series so popular. Give the people more battle sequences and less talk and exposition.) Many characters return as various actors reprise their supporting roles, which is an especially fine touch to its loyal followers.The cast itself does a serviceable job whenever they are given time to converse, but to Mr. Abrams, action is the only key to the film's success. Daisy Ripley as the Jedi, Rey, and Adam Driver as her foe, Kylo Ren, have big screen personas which helps moviegoers to connect to their characters, although many of the other supporting performers have little to do than look stoic, get their reaction shots, and heroically fly off to battle. Except for Ms. Ripley's and Mr. Driver's characters, the rest of the ensemble are either walk-on cameos or underdeveloped figures, even though there are some nice plot twists and unexpected visits from a galaxy of former players that should suffice even the film's harshest critics.Still, the visual effects are the main reason for viewing this blockbuster and they are very well done, except for a cheesy segment involving Rey and one of her spiritual gurus. Surprisingly, the highlight is not the film's climactic ending, which is more busy than exciting, but a seamless blending of CGI involving a dueling saber fight set against a raging sea. Production design by Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins is impressive throughout the movie.Yet, while there is much technical artistry and craft on display, there is also a hovering sameness, be it with the movie's retreads of stock characters, formulaic intergalactic spacecrafts, and non-stop shoot-em-ups. In all honesty, a 'been there, seen it all before' feeling has plagued this series in the last few chapters before this. This Force may have been with me once too often.Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker remains a fitting enough finale. The film is always entertaining, although the series may have worn out its welcome. As an absent Yoda might say, ' Wise on top to leave.'NOTE: So, we bid adieu to our good friends, leia, Luke, Hans, and Rey. The end was bittersweet but worth the wait. But in sci-fi, nothing dies. Things just morph and reshape. Studios look to a new force for the almighty dollar. A new generation awaits.",7,2,10,25 December 2019
American Sniper," At Close Range
","This film is recommended.War is hell. We know that to be a fact. But it's the hell that lingers within the damaged heart and mind of a soldier that is on full display in Clint Eastwood's gripping American Sniper, a biography about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and his tours of duty in Iraq.￼An assertive screenplay by Jason Hall shows Kyle's life, from impressionable child to family man culminating to trained assassin. Bradley Cooper is fine as the sharpshooting ace and the actor adds more award-winning work to his impressive resume. His portrayal of a man consumed with war is very nuanced and Cooper is a commanding presence on screen. Sienna Miller co-stars as Kyle's devoted wife, Taya, and the actress brings the emotional bond needed to make Kyle appear more human, unlike the laughable plastic dolls substituting for their real life infants. (Come on, the budget couldn't afford real kids! Really?)￼Tersely directed by Clint Eastwood, the film is an old-fashion war movie with a modern day sensibility. Eastwood has more than acquitted himself with this fine character study, having left the foolishness of his disappointing Jersey Boys behind. Finally in his comfort zone once again (the war zone), he ratchets up the suspense and trauma that a soldier can experience before and after combat. The director's use of violence is effectively done. However, Eastwood doesn't always succeed in the quieter moments stateside, where he allows the film to become pompous with unnecessary preachy messages about duty, honor, and country, all done very heavy-handedly. (A scene between Kyle and a wounded vet at the doctor's office is poorly staged and totally unbelievable.) But there are many other memorable scenes, especially toward the end of the film in its powerful final battle sequence with its raging sandstorm between the soldiers and the non-stop gunfire and a family cookout that becomes a warning signal about Kyle's inner demons).Initially, the use of flashbacks add some background about the man, but Eastwood seems more interested in creating the myth. American Sniper never congeals into one solid film. Transitions from the war scenes abruptly change into family sequences that are less satisfying. The film's structure is episodic and choppy. The time frames are jarring and incomplete, particularly Kyle's winning bout with PTSD that seems more like a footnote. There has been some debate about the hero worship that Eastwood ascribed to this man and his actions, under the guise of patriotism and courage. I will not debate that issue, nor the factual free-wheeling that is customary with the genre of docudramas, but I can criticize the film for its underplaying of the impact of PTSD upon our troops, which is the most interesting part of the film, and the overplaying of the machismo aspects of soldiering that resembled Eastwood's earlier film, Heartbreak Ridge, and its training scenes. Also, the intense competition between Kyle and his adversary sniper, Mustafa, seriously becomes a crucial deterrent to the film's credibility and diverts this strong film into pure melodramatic mode.￼Kudos to the superb editing by Joel Cox and Gary Roach, the excellent sound mixing of war noise and sudden silence by John T. Reitz, Gregg Rudloff, and Walt Martin, plus the gritty photography by Tom Stern, all contributing to a powerful statement about the casualties of war. This is solid filmmaking even if the film's parts are more fascinating than its whole. American Sniper may carry its patriotism on its sleeve, but it does honor the man, and is a loving tribute to soldiers everywhere.

Lion," Little Boy Lost
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An uplifting and riveting story, given even more credibility due to a strong performance by Dev Petal in the central role.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: An adopted child searches for his biological mother.JIM'S REVIEW: Garth Davis makes an impressive directorial debut in Lion, the true story of a little boy lost. Through a series of unfortunate incidents, five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar, giving a lovely performance) is forced to use his wiles and survival instincts as he is abandoned in the street jungle known as Calcutta, India. He perseveres and grows up to become the child of loving adoptive parents in Australia, all the while yearning to find his way home and the family he left behind.The story elicits an empathetic reaction from any moviegoer and Mr. Davis mostly resists the melodramatic hyperbola and concentrates on the more personal view of a man trying to come to terms with his past. The director tends to overuse cross-cuts of the past and present images to advance the narrative, but emotionally, it's always embraces his audience as we journey along with this child's plight.The screenplay by Luke Davies is based on Saroo's own autobiography, A Long Way Home, and seems to stick to the facts rather well, although some of the minor supporting characters are in need of more depth. Except for Dev Patel as the older Saroo and Nicole Kidman as his adoptive mother, who are both superb, others play a more peripheral role. Especially underdeveloped is Saroo's relationship with (Roma Downey). Also, some of the build-up of Saroo's traumatic upbringing seems spotty, as if some scenes were missing or excised during the filmmaking which could have explained more clearly his sudden behavioral changes and mood swings. Yet the underlying story is still quite powerful and moving. Lion is a well made and thoroughly engrossing film that has enough impact to satisfy the most jaded of viewers.",8,2,4,14 January 2017
Southpaw," A Dumb Palooka of a Movie
","(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: This film never lands its knock-out punch but it does go the distance.GRADE: B-Boxing is a grueling sport, but not as grueling as sitting through the unoriginal Southpaw, a cliché-ridden heavy-weight tale of a down-on-his-luck pugilist plugging away to make his life better. The characters are light-weight replicas of real-life people, but it's the actors, especially Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role, who punch up this film to make it a worthy contender. Granted, there have been some real knockouts in the cinematic history of boxing movies (Raging Bull, The Fighter, Million Dollar Baby, the original Rocky). And there have also been some god-awful ones (The Main Event, Grudge Match, all the other Rocky sequels) Southpaw falls squarely in the midsection. It's strong when it stays within the ropes, but once it leaves the arena, it's hopelessly pretentious, utterly predictable, and so heavy-handed, even with its gloves on or off.If you have seen the film's trailer (which reveals the entire movie), you know where the film is going before the count. It's The Champ revisited, but grittier, bloodier, and supposedly more realistic, except for its nonsensical story.As our story begins, Billy Hope (geez!) has everything: a loving wife, an adorable daughter and a lucrative boxing career. He is a wonderful guy, a champion on top of the world until (gasp!) tragedy strikes. Literally, once the Great White Hope in the boxing world, Billy falls on some hard times (of course). His road to redemption won't be easy (of course), but he will fight tooth and nail to get back on top (of course).Jake Gyllenhaal's commitment to this part is impressive. He toned up and certainly looks like a down-on-his luck boxer who has seen the dark side too often. With his highly sculptured physique, rock-hard abs, and bruised and battered face, the actor earnestly tries to pump some life into this lifeless role. But, as written, Billy is so one-dimensional and never really amounts to a real character, more of a caricature that we have seen a zillion times in boxing movies. Blame the screenwriter, Kurt Sutter, not the actor. Rachel McAdams plays Mo, his tough but loving wife (complete with a New Yawk accent) and Oona Laurence is memorable as Leila, their daughter caught in Billy's downward spiral. Forest Whitaker adds some interest in his supporting role as Tick Willis, Billy's loyal manager and conscience. Moviegoers can revel in his few dramatic moments whenever he is on the screen. Rounding out the cast is 50 Cents as Jordan Mains, his money-hungry promoter and Miguel Gomez playing Magic Escobar, his villainous opponent. (Hey, what is it with these odd names anyway?)While the dialog has an authentic grittiness, the plot becomes more and more absurd in its predictability, As multiple obstacles quickly begin to mount in the most of illogical ways against our hero, who should be renamed Billy Hopeless, the film starts to become a parody of itself. Director Antoine Fuqua doesn't help matters with his overt foreshadowing of events and his penchant for soap opera melodramatics. He stages the boxing scenes with lots of hand-held in-your-face close-ups and handles these sequences with some verve. But his vision of the human drama outside the ring is so labored and overdone. The manipulative ending offers no surprises and the overall result is a bit of a yawn. Southpaw is a dumb palooka of a movie. Even before the first punch is thrown, the contrived plot and its superficial characters kayo the film. But Gyllenhaal's impassioned performance is reason enough to see this film.",6,0,1,28 July 2015
Ant-Man," Anty Maim
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: A major upgrade for a minor comic book superhero that is lots of fun.GRADE: B The battle between man and those pesky ant invaders rages on, with our species usually triumphant having our vast arsenal of insect sprays at our fingertips and our sheer size to trounce them into smithereens. Size unfortunately does matter over this tiny creatures. Granted they readily outnumber us, work extremely well together (as opposed to us), and have mega-strength in comparison. But to make a superhero out of this ant-heap, as with this latest superhero franchise, Ant-Man, sets itself up with limitless limitations of the powers that be.Yet the film gingerly sidesteps these disadvantages most enjoyably due to its comedic tone, nice use of CGI, compelling action sequences, and some fine acting from its cast. Plus having Paul Rudd in the title role helps make this movie-going experience more diverting than expected.Ant-Man is the cleverest of major upgrades to one of Marvel Comic's most minor of superheroes. The film never takes itself so serious, its chief virtue. It does dish out the customary exposition heavy-handedly, in larger than necessary dosage in order to try to explain the science behind the superman. The interconnection with that other Marvel Comic's Avenger gang of crusaders becomes weary and unnecessary as this film would do better to stand alone. But the script by committee wisely takes its time to develop its characters and their relationships between all the chases, explosions, and plotting. (Three writers, Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Mr. Rudd himself are credited with the screenplay.)The cast makes the film work so efficiently. Mr. Rudd is totally appealing as Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man, a petty thief who wants to leave his criminal past behind him. This actor uses his oddball charm and high likability factor to immediately pulls us onto his side as he learns the ups and downs of becoming a superhero. Michael Douglas plays Dr. Hank Pym, his mentor and scientific mastermind behind this great shrinking man plan and he is convincing in his role. Evangeline Lilly is Hope, his estranged daughter and Scott's romantic conquest and the actress has a strong screen presence and great chemistry with Rudd. Our evil villain and disgruntled former protégé of Pym, is Darren Cross, a.k.a. Yelllowjacket, who, of course, is interested in wealth and world domination. This role is wonderfully played by Corey Stoll with just the right crazed menace. Michael Pena adds the comic relief as Scott's loyal and dopey sidekick. Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, John Slattery, and Martin Donovan round out the cast in smaller parts. Ant-Man's sharp contrast with the real and miniature world is captivates and the film's spirited playfulness within this comic book genre is refreshing. It is never more spot-on than in its climactic action scene between our hero and the film's arch villain, Yellowjacket, set aboard a speeding Fisher-Price Thomas the Train that is priceless fun.Solidly directed by Peyton Reed, Ant-Man follows its true-and-true formula with a resourcefulness that will certainly pave the way for another sequel. There is lots to admire about these pismires and their human leader and Ant-Man proves itself to be worthy of more than a little respect indeed.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,1,8,25 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain Ab Crunch Gives America a Bad Name
","This film is not recommended.As the last wild days of summer wind down, and this bleak season of superhero flicks have ebbed for awhile, plus with nothing on the tube and nothing in need to buy, it only seems apropos to take in a diversion now and then. As this being America, the land of the free ( excluding movie ticket prices ) and the home of the brave, I sought out the help of the Captain himself.I finally saw the comic book adaptation of Captain America: The First Avenger, which has been in the theaters since late July. This somewhat entertaining action film had its origins from the early 1940's to help the war effort and serve as patriotic propaganda. The film begins promisingly and is still wisely set in that nostalgic period, with nasty Nazis and other assorted villains and traitors. It has an interesting look to it due to that glamorous era, strong production design, and some of the director's choices. ( I felt the film to be very reminiscent of an earlier film called The Rocketeer, a nice little gem of a children's film, only to discover in my research that that film was also directed by the same director, Joe Johnson, who seems content to plagiarize from himself. )But as with so many comic book films, the simple plot remains too simple: A top secret mission changes an unfit for military service weakling into a burly and buff muscleman who becomes the champion of American life, liberty, and justice for all. Chris Evans righteously plays our hero, Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America. His job, besides saving the world and kicking some German butt, is to stop a Nazi subgroup known as Hydra from winning WWII and achieving world domination, plus, as an American icon, still look good in a superhero costume. I am happy to report that it is the last category where the film achieves its greatest success. With his tight fitting red, white, and blues, his nicely chiseled good looks, and a body that could easily make Abercrombie and Fitch models do their share of double takes, Evans is perfectly cast as this superman, well, at least physically. But just like the all too earnest and bland Captain America of comic fame, this superhero remains a a blank character, devoid of any humor, emotion, or depth. Evans plays this man as the straight man with any partner. He portrays the hero with a glum seriousness and without any self-effacing humor. Comedy, like nylons, is in short supply in this movie. One just doesn't care about him, his mission, or any action on the screen. The supporting cast never clicks either. Hayley Atwell is Peggy, the bright, no-nonsense broad of his dreams. She's pretty, gutsy, and empowered, and many times, I thought she could give our hero more bruises than anyone else on the screen, and that includes a crusty Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Phillips, and Hugo Weaving as his wicked adversary, The Red Skull. As the evil villain, Weaving starts off strong and has the makings of an intriguing character until his make-up and special effects take over his role. Veteran actors Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci bring a needed boost to the film but are essentially wasted in their poorly written roles.The story gets muddled with its one-note action scenes, its one-dimensional characters, and its goody-two shoes hero. The film also tends to wallow too often into cliché territory. Yet, even if the charms never outweigh the formulaic flaws of Captain America, there are still plenty of action sequences, fights, explosions, and gadgetry for those moviegoers who crave that sort of thing.Captain America: The First Avenger is routine stuff all right. In his fight with Hydra, our Captain and this film comes across as all wet. GRADE: C+NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",Null,1,4,4 September 2011
American Hustle," Game On!
","This film is highly recommended.The comb-over, that not-so-subtle way of camouflaging your own flaws so that others might see you in a different light. Perhaps, it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy, a means of vanity over delusion, a fight against the helplessness of aging. Literally, it's all a slight of hand, a desperate attempt at concealing the obvious truth and garnering personal acceptance at any cost. This startling opening image, that of a con man named Irving Rosenfeld (a portly Christian Bale) preening before a mirror, begins American Hustle, David O. Russell's dramedy about grifters and their schemes to get what they want.Even before this clever opening shot, American Hustle begins with the following disclaimer: Some of this actually happened. This title card zeroes in on the perfect comic tone for the film and the Abscam sting operation of the late 1970's becomes Russell's inspiration. The film uses fictitious characters to show the ongoing corruption of governmental leaders during that era. And characters they are, fully realized and played for our utmost farcical enjoyment!The film's characters are of the Guys and Dolls variety, a screwball assortment of Runyonesque endearing quirks and lowlife mobster stereotypes. Besides Irving, the mastermind of the scam, we also meet Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) Irving's sexy and cunning moll and mistress, their target, Carmine Politio (Jeremy Renner), all swagger pompadour and good intentions as an ambitious New Jersey mayor, Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), Irving's trophy wife (if the trophy in question is Best Dimwit of 1978), a modern reworking of the Miss Adelaine type of gal, and FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), a vain and obsessively slick operator out to get them all.The ensemble is wonderful. Bale literally carries the weight of the film and creates a complex character driven by greed and his need for living the high life. Cooper energizes the film with a fervor of zealousness and brashness that sets all the antics in motion. Renner plays his character as a sincere dolt wanting his share of fame and glory with an exacting ineptitude. This male trio play off each other so very well. But it is their female counterparts that spin the film into the comic and strangely tragic stratosphere. With her many accents and characterizations, Adams' Sydney conveys a full range of emotions from her street smart petty criminal to the elegant and sophisticated Lady Edith. Lawrence's Rosalyn is a wonderful ditz, a floozy who is quick to react without realizing the consequences from her words or deeds. She steals every scene she's in. (The film's high point is when these two actresses have a memorable altercation in the ladies room about their role in Irving's life.) Strong support by Louis C.K., Michael Pena, Jack Huston, Alessandro Nivola, Shea Whigham, and Elisabeth Rohm round out this perfect cast.Russell's script, co-written with Eric Singer, is a throwback to the quick banter of the Hollywood screwball comedies of the 40's. The dialog is quick-witted and sly, even if the situation causes more serious repercussions for all those involved. The direction is concise and detailed, from his larger-than-life characters down to the polyester period costumes and 70's pop music soundtrack. Russell's production team outdoes themselves with special mention going to costume designer Michael Wilkinson, the fine art direction of Jesse Rosenthal, and Linus Sandgren's fluid cinematography.American Hustle is a delightful con game that keeps the movie-going audience guessing right up until the film reaches its foregone conclusion. Russell has added yet another fine film to his impressive resume that already includes: Three Kings, The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook and I Heart Hucklebees (well, let's not include the latter). American Hustle may will be this prolific director's best work to date. It certainly is one of the best movies of 2013.

Incendies," Imagine When 1 + 1 Doesn't Equal 2
","This film is recommended.  Imagine there's no countries, It isn't hard to do, Nothing to kill or  die for, And no religion too.  -Lyrics from John Lennon's Imagine   Religion has always been a unifying and emotional force to some and a  polarizing and divisive one to others. It has shaped and guided our  world with the holiest of words and actions and also destroyed and  misled many under the philosophical guise of good and godliness. It has  provided insight and strength to one group while blinding and weakening  another with overt powers over its most devout believers. This dualism  is ever present in the thought-provoking Oscar nominated foreign film,  Incendies, directed by Denis Villeneuve. We are forced to examine the  far-reaching effect of religion and its aftereffects in its tale of two  siblings who begin a spiritual journey to fulfill their mother's last  wishes.  The plot involves a twin brother and sister who are forced to confront  their mother's past deeds and secretive life. Jeanne and Simon (  Melissa Desormeaux and Maxim Gaudette ) are given two letters from  their dead mother, Newal ( Lubna Azabal ). They are asked to locate  their brother who they never knew had existed and deliver an envelope  to him and also find their lost father. This request takes Jeanne to a  Middle Eastern country as she tries to unravel the mystery while Simon  looks elsewhere.  Told in flashback, mostly from Newal's point of view, we learn about  her unknown past and her loves. Just as Jeanne and Simon unravel the  threads of her lifestory, we discover the impact that politics and  religion formed upon her mother and Newal's ultimate choices that led  her to a violent conflicted existence.   The film takes its bleak depressing subject matter and immerses itself  directly into the world of civil wars, martyrs, violence, and religious  zealots. Director Villeneuve successfully shows this clash of cultures  between Christians and Muslims and the consequences of hatred and  pointless bloodshed throughout the years. However, he weakens his own  film by allowing some scenes to go on too long, causing less tension  and suspense with his narrative. With his cumbersome flashback  structure, he also divulges key evidence in the ongoing investigation  to the movie audience before his present day characters can unravel the  intricacies of the mystery itself. ( I, for one, figured out the  supposedly shocking climax with a half hour left before the film's end  credits appeared. )  Still, the film contains powerful images, mostly when dealing with the  film's violent nature ( a bus and its passengers set afire, close-ups  of battered and bruised legs of political prisoners, a frightened child  cold-bloodedly shot as she tries to flee for safety ) and strong  performances by its cast, especially Lubna Azabel as the sad and  tortured woman whose death begins this tale.  Incendies presents both worlds with a haunting clarity, one steeped in  traditions and servitude and another trying to break free of its bonds.  This is serious and fearless filmmaking that leaves one feeling moved  and helpless at the same time. The moviegoer leaves the theater hoping  the world will live as one, even if the equation can never be solved.  GRADE: B",7,0,8,25 June 2011
Rush," Fast and Loose
","This film is recommended.Gentlemen, start your engines! The need for speed is the mainstay in Ron Howard's cinematic ode to racing, Rush, a well crafted, if formulaic, Formula One racing car drama.  The film tells the true story of two racing champions, British playboy James Hunt, and temperamental Austrian driver Niki Lauda, and centers on the on-going rivalry between the two drivers. Both are Type A personalities: ambitious, energetic, and competitive. And both are unlikeable characters, which throws the audience's sympathies askew from the onset.  They act predictably petty and selfish throughout the film with no real maturity or growth to speak of. There is no real surprises in the character's development, actions, or motivations in Peter Morgan's straightforward script. It also doesn't help that the dialog never builds any real conflict or resolution.Yet what makes Rush so watchable are the purely technical aspects of the film. Howard knows how to set up his shots for maximum effect and he skillfully keeps the action sequences exciting and tense. The Formula One racing scenes are wonderful and quite exhilarating.  Particularly impressive is the rain-soaked Grand Prix racing sequence an expect blending of visual images. His biggest misstep is incorporating the real footage of Hunt and Lauda which seems a tad jarring in comparison.The film boasts first-rate production values. The editing by Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill is just terrific, as is the stunning photography by Anthony Dod Mantle.  Special mention also goes to the expert sound design, the strong makeup work, and a music score by Hans Zimmer which is never overdone or intrusive. The period art direction and costumes help to capture the 70's era with clever subtleties. As long as Rush stays literally on the course, the film is highly entertaining. But whenever it detours into the realm of the human drama, the film is a bit of a bore. This is not the fault of the actors involved. Liam Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl bring the right degree of vanity and physically posturing to their conventional roles. Both actors make their stilted characters more believable. Manyl of the supporting characters are underwritten and rarely seem authentic. This is especially true with the female love interests played by Olivia Wilde and.Alexandra Maria Lara, fine actresses that aren't given enough to do.Although Rush may veer dangerously off trackage times, it does cross the finish line, just not in the winner's circle.

Nightcrawler," Night of the Hunter
","This film is highly recommended. (☆☆☆ ½)A nightcrawler is an ugly and slimy animal that surfaces at night and feeds upon live and dead organisms, a more than apt title for Dan Gilroy's riveting new film by the same name. In Nightcrawler, the creepy crawly creature in this case is one, Mr. Louis Bloom. The plot follows Lou (Jake Gyllenhaal), an amoral petty thief turned instant paparazzi. After viewing a grisly accident that becomes his inspiration for a new career choice, Lou follows a blood trail of dead bodies and injured victims by recording their crime scenes and hawking his footage to the highest bidder. He finds a willing partner in Nina (Rene Russo), an ambitious television producer looking for big ratings.Nightcrawler's central premise does seem a tad far-fetched by today's standards. While television has become somewhat lax due to cable and streaming services and the need for one-oneupmanship for that all-mighty ratings boost, the chance of actually seeing this bloody and gruesome coverage seems more the distant future than today. (Yes, one can see this type of journalism online, but regulations on television do limit that type of imagery. Perhaps it may be viewed on PCN (the Paddy Chayefsky Network), of which this film more than closely aligns.) Most recently, other films have taken to the subject of the news and its drive for sensationalism, as with Gone Girl, but Nightcrawler relishes in its own seediness.The film aims squarely at its easy target by shows journalism at its most tawdry and the human condition as mere fodder for the most sordid of extremes. Director Gilroy, who also wrote the screenplay, captures the right rhythms and atmosphere of L.A. at night, largely due to the strong camera-work of Robert Elswit and the adroit editing of John Gilroy, the director's gifted brother. (It appears to be a family affair as Tony Gilroy, Dan's brother, is one of the producers too.)Foremost is Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Louis. The actor physically sheds his previous screen persona as a sexy leading man with his subtle acting choices. He hints at Lou's crazed nature with fast-talking patter and twisted monologues as a persuasive tool, bugged-eyed glances and gaunt pallor to mask a wounded soul within, and a sudden snide smile to indicate a shrewd and cunning mind. These traits help to create an indelible character. The mercurial turns show the duality of a character who can be a sad and pathetic human being or a cold and calculating monster. His Lou Bloom is a memorable psychotic loner, part deranged inspirational speaker and part harbinger of bad things to come. This is Gyllenhaal's finest performance and one of this year's best.Strong support is also provided by Rene Russo, channeling the guise of Faye Dunaway into her career-driven mad newswoman, Riz Ahmed as Lou's partner-in-crime, Bill Paxton as Lou's video rival, and Kevin Rahm as one of the few characters in the film with a conscience.Nightcrawler builds to an explosive if somewhat predictable climax, but the film stays its course as a stinging indictment of the television news media. The film may be overlooked by many moviegoers and it might not win many awards this season due to its relentless disturbing view of American corruption and human squalor, but any serious moviegoer should see Nightcrawler for the sheer audacity of its subject matter, a powerful filmmaking debut of a talented director, and Gyllenhaal's break-out role. As they say in the trade: viewer discretion is advised. GRADE: B+Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9,1,4,6 November 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Good Music, Great Performance, but Unnecessary Gay Shaming
","GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: The only Queen in this sanitized but entertaining biography of Freddy Mercury is the band itself. So much for the true story of a bisexual icon.JIM'S REVIEW: Bohemian Rhapsody avoids the facts in its retelling of gay icon, Freddy Mercury, and his band Queen. Rather than depict his sex and drug crazed world which included his bisexuality and addiction to cocaine, it purports to tell his biography well within its PG-13 rating in a strictly sanitized way. The film plays fast and loose with the facts and the time lines don't quite gel. Director Bryan Singer focuses on the band and its early years to stardom (1970 to 1985) with only hints of the tragic consequences that will affect the group. (Mr. Mercury died of AIDS in 1991, one day after he announced to his fans that he contracted this fatal disease. The film never gets to that era choosing rather to go out on a high note, Queen's LIVE AID concert in 1979. The usual title card summaries his and the band's final years.)All of Queen's music is there, with its glitz and hard rock glam, as is the star turn by its lead singer, acted to perfection by Rami Malek (More on this actor's performance later.). The film vividly captures that rock era and creates concert footage that emulates the band and its theatricality. But the script by Anthony McCarten is unfortunate. It is conventional storytelling of an unconventional subject that tries to cover too much as it covets one cliche after the next.Typically seen, as in most musical film biographies, are the group's rise from obscurity, their early successes, band fall-out due to too much fame and fortune, relationships undone, etc. In fact, the only new creative detour, and it's not a good one, is the subtle gay shaming that occurs throughout the movie. Most gay characters are depicted as villainous or amoral stereotypes. The film purposely downplays Mr. Mercury's interest in same sex relationships, except for his male love interest who is introduced at the tail end of the film. This may be more accepting to a majority of audience members, but it is a dishonest and unnecessary approach to Mr. Mercury's life.Instead, the film emphasizes his healthy heterosexual 'the love of his life', his wife, Mary Austin (well played by Lucy Boynton). While this relationship lasted a long time and ended due to his infidelity, the film celebrates their passion while almost completely avoiding his sexual identity.All in all, the film is generally well acted with fine supporting turns by Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joe Mazzello as the bandmates. An unrecognizable Mike Myers. Aidan Gillen, and Allen Leech round out the cast. But for this film to work, a central performance that captures Freddy Mercury's stage persona must be literally center stage. And Bohemian Rhapsody has that at its core in Mr. Malek's terrific portrayal. With an overbite large enough to chew up any scenery, Mr. Malek wisely shows some restraint in his backstory, filling in the many gaps in an overstuffed script that enjoys contrivance over realism. He shows the singer's conceit very well and addresses his vulnerability with his scenes with family members. The actor saves the strutting for his lip-synched imitation of the lead singer on stage and is very convincing, especially in an exciting conclusion of a 12 minute Queen concert in which my movie audience instinctively sang along.If only the filmmakers of Bohemian Rhapsody followed their movie's own tagline: Fearless Lives Forever than hide behind a cardboard cutout of a musical legend who deserved a more honest and accurate treatment. They assembled a strong cast but let them and their film bite the dust.",7,2,5,7 November 2018
Bird Box," Flying Low
","GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Real suspense takes a tailspin in this horror thriller due to a heavy-handed plot.JIM'S REVIEW: In Susanne Bier's chilling but illogical apocalyptic thriller, Bird Box, the world is coming to an end. Unknown forces suddenly control your mind and make mostly everyone unpleasant, You're either suicidal or homicidal. A compelling premise, especially in the beginning stages of this horror film. But the movie has some issues with holding on to its creepy promise as the plot begins to unravel to its shaky conclusion.The plot involves some survivors who band together in one house in order to survive. The rules are simple, even if the story is not. Much of the Eric Heisserer's screenplay is succinctly explained by its heroine and mother, Malorie Hayes (Sandra Bullock) in the film's opening minutes. She adamantly states to us and her children: Do not remove your blindfolds or you die. The mantra, do not look into the light or you are doomed, is repeated ad nausea for those of us moviegoers who are dim-witted or bird-brained. In fact, it seems that only the certifiable insane, pregnant women, and birds are immune to this deadly Circe siren call. There is lots of conjecture about the problem, but no real solutions or valid explanations. Moviegoers must willfully accept the plotting and move on.The film flashbacks prior to the global catastrophe, to offer some backstory, yet it never gives any enlightenment of the dilemma facing its cast of characters. They are a stereotypical bunch, from doomsayer (John Malkovich), hero (Trevante Rhodes), and other minor figures that are woefully underdeveloped and dispatched as pawns for the next killing. Still, the film is highly suspenseful and has moments of real tension served by its director (especially the initial chaos sequence), But a horror film with an invisible monster does present some unforeseen problems in the scare department, All the moving trees and rustling bushes, complete with an atmospheric music score, and eerie sound mixing, just cannot hide the flaws of the plot. Expeditions into the outside world are far-fetched and straining for logic, despite the human speed bumps on the road.The story becomes even more ludicrous when the Hayes family finally decide to take a 4 day river trip to a far-away refuge. One never knows if it is fate, unanticipated events, or just sloppy screenwriting that gets Malorie to her final destination. By the film's conclusion, there are still many unanswered questions about the ensuing havoc, and still more about that arduous trek that becomes more implausible with each overbearing situation. (However, a nifty twist does add some cleverness to the narrative.)Perhaps the main asset to this thriller is Ms. Bullock herself, who ups her game with a very strong and believable performance. She provides all of the compassion of a fearless woman who fights to protect her children from peril, even if her character's weaknesses are based on fear and tinged with sadness. The actress uses her likable screen persona to her advantage with her self-effacing banter and plays her role very effectively, even when she becomes overwrought.Bird Box is a better-than-average film, reminiscent of some of M. Night Shyamalan's earlier work. While the film never truly soars,it does somewhat glide along with its share of tension-filled scenes. The movie consistently entertains, even with nary a peep of logic in sight. Maybe, it should have taken off its blindfold more often.NOTE: Nearly the same notion, a family in danger due to otherworldly events, is the plot of a superior horror movie, A Quiet Place, one of 2018's best films. That horror film is destined to become a classic and would be a better moviegoing experience to savor, providing well-earned suspense. By all means, see that film!",7,1,6,24 December 2018
Baby Driver," Baby Love
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fast and furious heist film with jaw-dropping car stunts that takes the moviegoer on a wild ride, as long as one can accepts its many leaps of logic.SYNOPSIS: After finding true love, a getaway driver wants to leave the world of crime.JIM'S REVIEW: Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a loner who likes high speed action. He loves the fast and furious high octane lifestyle. Give him a car and he can move from zero to 120 like no one else can. Which makes him the perfect getaway driver and gives him a passport into the profitable world of crime. Injured in a car accident as a child that left him parent-less and with a permanent case of tinnitus (a constant ringing in his ears), Baby drowns out the real world with classic rock music as his live soundtrack. This also helps him concentrate better on his unique driving skills. Of course, he eventually meets Debora (Lily James), a cute waitress who steals Baby's heart while he steals other items.Now they say, crime doesn't pay, although Baby is making a killing...that is until Baby wants out of the crime game. Doc, crime czar and all-around bad guy, played with over-the-top menace by Kevin Spacey, won't hear it. Hence, the basic conflict.Edgar Wright wrote and directed this action heist thriller and he takes his simple (very simple) story, fills each frame with exciting stunt work, and creates memorable offbeat characters. Baby's bank robbing cohorts are a colorful motley crew. They include Jamie Foxx (Jamie Foxx), Griff (Jon Bernthal), Eddie No-Nose (Flea), JD (Lanny Joon), and Buddy (Jon Hamm), and his darling, Darling (Eiza Gonzalez). All of the cast know that the story is preposterous but they play their roles with high energy, rapturous glee, and a knowing satirical wink to the audience. (Especially fine are Mr. Hamm and Ms. Gonzalez as a crazed modern day Bonnie and Clyde.) Yes, the plot is silly and devoid of any real depth or logic, especially as it accelerates to its tidy little upbeat ending, but it is lots of fun.Baby Driver is all action too, more like a demolition derby with multiple chase scenes than a serious movie about crime and punishment. It's Reservoir Dogs with the sardonic humor and without the excessive bloodbath or wit. Call it Grand Theft with Auto, set to music. Skillful as it may be, the film still seems like an endless series of music videos looped together to form a movie. All the action moves with a strong syncopated beat, highly choreographed for our enjoyment. It's full throttle escapism. The first movie musical about cars.Baby Driver presents a major case of style over substance and style mostly wins out. Kudos to the excellent taut editing by Paul Machliss and Jonathan Amos and Bill Pope's electric hued photography that gives the film its unique look. Mr. Wright stages and choreographs his action sequences with an edgy disregard for realism. He also keeps his characters from being lost in all the maelstrom of revved engines and motor mayhem by developing individuals with distinct personalities and lasting traits. (Loved the his and hers neck tattoos.) All remains suspenseful and riveting, that is, until the film takes a sharp detour in its third act, veering hopelessly into typical chase and crash mode. Some of its characters start to act out of character, acting more like mere plot devices set in motion to tidy up all the loose ends. In fact, the movie never explains how characters know the whereabouts of others in order to seek revenge and one character's 'change of heart' makes little sense and actually weakens the story-line. Too many leaps of logic.Still, fasten your safety belts and move over, Quentin! Edgar Wright's well made film is for adrenaline junkies everywhere; serious film-goers may enjoy it too, as long as they slip their minds into neutral. With a plot that defies logic and having enough potholes to do major damage to one's faculties, Baby Driver is a joyride.",8,12,21,3 July 2017
Man of Steel," Man of Lead
","This film is not recommended.He's back! After numerous versions on stage, screen, and television, Superman has returned. This latest reincarnation, entitled Man of Steel, brings us a more brooding and realistic superhero, with more advanced CGI and less comic book humor. It follows past stories of our superhero and his myth with a earnestness and devotion as not to offend any fan base. In fact, the film takes itself too seriously. What it doesn't do is thrill those die-hard fans or anyone else either. It's all so deadly dull.Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill as Clark Kent a.k.a. Kal-El a.k.a. Superman. Physically, he's perfectly suited for the role. With flowing cape and form-fitting blue spandex (minus the red underwear this time around), Cavil makes a believable hero that could cause serious damage to any villain but more probably cause excessive drooling by most women and gay men. He is super eye candy, cavorting around Metropolis with his low body fat index and rippling muscles on display. (There are many scenes showing off the actor's naked torso and manly physique. We call that in the biz: the money shot.) As for his acting, he isn't given much to do than strut his stuff, which he does handsomely. With a formulaic script by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan (yes, one and the same), the set pieces for the legend to unfold are all there. From his escape from Krypton as an infant, to his days as Superboy with the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, easily the best part of the film); Clark's subsequent meeting with Lois Lane (Amy Adams); his on-going fight for truth, justice, and the American Way. Yet the way they're assembled is strictly rote filmmaking, or not well wrote, pardon the pun.Superman's love interest has been modernized for the 21st century too. The dependable Amy Adams plays Lois Lane, now a Pulitizer Award winning investigative reporter. The actress has the necessary spunk and tries valiantly to pump some energy into her sidekick role. The chemistry between her and Cavill is totally lacking any real heat. Supporting cast members include: Russell Crowe (in a non-singing role, thankfully) as Jor-El, Christopher Meloni as Col. Hardy, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White. All of these competent actors are wasted in their underwritten roles. That their roles are short is merciful.Of course, to make an action film work, one needs an evildoer to counter-weigh all the heroic good. That chore falls on the broad shoulders of Michael Shannon as General Zod. Shannon has proved himself to be a strong actor in past endeavors. Here he brings on the menace in dollops of overheated ham. (Hold the mustard!) Let us hope this misstep will be a learning experience for this talented actor to choice his next project more wisely.I won't belabor the story, as it is known by most moviegoers. In fact, the familiarity of the plot creates some of the boredom. Director Zach Snyder (whose previous track record includes awful movies like Watchmen and Sucker Punch) still hasn't learned much about restraint and character development. He stages his action sequences with no real flair and continually stuffs his film with so many special effects and so much frenzied camera-work that the actors just seem dwarfed in their surroundings. Too often one cannot distinguish the special effects and stunt-work with the in-your-face shaky photography. (The anti-climactic slug match between Superman and Zod goes on far too long, becoming a slog fest.) The blatant product placements seen throughout the film (BP, Sears, IHOP, etc.) is even more dizzying. (I can't wait to visit IHOP for their Superman Short Stack Special, sure to be coming to a restaurant near you.) That the director elicits three of the today's finest actors (Adams, Shannon, and Fishburne) to deliver their worst performances in years however does make Snyder a triple threat indeed.Synder also get sub-par work from production designer Alex McDowell, who seems to be lost somewhere in the Art Deco years and Futurama, and film editor David Brenner who cuts the film for the ADHD video crowd. Costumes by the team of James Acheson and Michael Wilkinson are in search of a time period and some subtle wit. The usually gifted Hans Zimmer provides the loud and obtrusive music. Wholly spandex, this film is so synthetic. Man of Steel may be one of this summer's biggest blockbusters, but for me, it was just one of this summer's biggest bust.

The Revenant," Shattered Glass
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: Some action scenes do impress, but the filmgoing experience becomes more arduous than needed. GRADE: BVengeance is a sweet and powerful impulse that keeps our protagonist alive in Alejandro G. Iñárritu's sprawling Western saga, The Revenant. Based on a true account of frontiersman Hugh Glass (a superb Leonardo DiCaprio), the film shows his violent journey homeward. Faced with natural obstacles, man-made treachery, Native American hostilities, and a horrifying bear attack, our pioneer fights for his life every moment on his trek through the wilderness. Left for dead by members in his hunting party, his grueling endurance test becomes one for the moviegoer as well as we face hardship after hardship in bloody realistic fashion.￼The onslaught may not make for comfortable viewing, but the artistry and virtuoso filmmaking on display is exhilarating to behold, even if the screenplay by the director and Mark L. Smith is one long series of strung together perils with not much in the way of strong character development (other than Glass himself), memorable dialog, or detailed plotting. The story itself is a typical survival tale, rote and predictable, with more than a touch of Terrance Mallick's inspiration and spiritualism thrown in with some cloying (but lovely) ethereal dreamscapes and hallucinations marring the action. Also, the film takes some liberties with the historical facts, especially in the fictional climax of the film.But the artistry by the director, actors, and behind-the-scenes crew is remarkable in their achievements and dedication. Iñárritu is a visionary director, setting up the many action sequences and positioning his actors to get the maximum effect from his unique point of view. (The actual making of this film must have been demanding with his on-location filming in the mountainous regions of Canada.) Shot under frigid conditions, the film has an authenticity that makes the movie all the more riveting with images that truly astound and leave one gaping at its brutality and beauty. The film is a visceral experience but it never touches the mind or heart. It is technically astute and emotionally aloof. (One false note, literally: The dissonant music by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto, and Bryce Dessner, which has a mysterious and haunting quality, tends to telegraph the ominous approaching danger the minute any chord is sounded.)Still, one cannot gush enough about the glorious panoramic wintry vistas and fluid camera-work of the gifted Emmanuel Lubezki. His wide angle shots and striking close-ups are exceptional as is the brilliant editing by Steven Mirrione. The movie-going audience is placed directly in the line of fire as arrows fly, bullets whiz by, and blood flows. Whenever the action starts, we are swept away into its powerful spell.￼Mr. DiCaprio gives a consummate performance as Glass. The role is subtly portrayed, mostly silent and intrinsic in its character, as this man battles his way suffering one misfortune after another. The misery shows in the actor's facial expressions and stance most effectively. This physically demanding role should send many awards his way as compensation. Providing strong support are Tom Hardy as his rival, Fitzgerald, and Domhnall Gleeson as his dutiful friend. ￼While not for those who have a low tolerance of pain and violence, The Revenant is must-see viewing for any serious film-goer for its technical expertise and the fully committed performance by Mr. Dicaprio. The awe and wander is there, just not the necessary wonder. Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,3,8,9 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," The Spy Who Went Into the Cold
","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: A riveting docudrama with Spielberg and Hanks at the top of their gameGRADE: A-Bridge of Spies is a true Cold War tale about the espionage business, its unethical surveillance methods, and the ongoing political war games orchestrated between powerful nations. The film does shamelessly manipulate the emotions of its audience and, at times, lets the nostalgia wash over its subject matter depicting more innocent times than in actuality, but, in the capable hands of Steven Spielberg, this is superb filmmaking and one of the year's best. ￼ The director's masterful handling of this complex story impresses in its concise storytelling and richly drawn characters. The screenplay by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers builds its narrative convincingly and clearly lays its background exposition through its compelling dialog that not only establishes the characters and their motives but moves the action at a steady pace.The year is 1957 when the United States and Russia were major enemies and spies worked undercover in search of oneupmanship. (Some things never change.) Back then, the world was splintering into different political factions, the military industrial complex was expanding, the threat of nuclear retaliation was a common practice, and the Berlin Wall became a reality. (A few do.)￼Into this quagmire is yet another political incident involving a convicted Russian spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and an imprisoned American, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a pilot caught behind enemy lines. One man, a lawyer named James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked to act as a go-between and secretly negotiate their exchange. The film chronicles these events with authenticity and high drama.The acting is excellent and the film is very well cast. Mr. Hanks has played the similarly upright decent common man role before but he continually impresses with his restraint and understatement of a man with a moral code that will not waiver. The actor never allows his character to overplay the righteousness and make Donovan more complicated by his subtle acting choices. Mr. Rylance has the more showier role as Abel and he brings a sly and layered portrait of a man who seems to enjoy being the pawn in this chess match. Other standouts include Alan Alda as one of Donavan's associates, Dakin Matthews as a very biased judge, Jon Curry and Michael Gaston as determined CIA agents, Will Rogers as as idealistic college student caught in the cloak-and-dagger web of intrigue, and Amy Ryan as Donovan's loving 50's wife, white pearl necklace included.￼Production values are top notch. Janusz Kaminski's lovely muted photography, wonderful art direction designed by Adam Stockhausen, Kasia Walicka-Malmone's nuanced period costumes, and a subtle and haunting music score by the talented Thomas Newman all work to enhance this film. But it is Mr. Spielberg's vision that resonates. His love of period Americana and the late fifties era create powerful vignettes (e.g.: spectators in a courtroom rise segueing into students reciting the Pledge of Allegiance leading to a school lecture on the effects of radiation poisoning to highly impressionable children, desperate people trying to escape over the Berlin Wall and, moments later, seeing typical children playing and climbing over wire fences, reporters scurrying over broken discarded flashbulbs from old fashioned cameras that litter a courthouse corridor, a frightening aerial escape as a plane spins out of control. Special kudos to Michael Kahn for his skillful editing as well.) Spielberg's willingness to establish period details of pop culture images defines the film brilliantly.￼Bridge of Spies is a triumph and one of Mr. Spielberg's finest cinematic projects to date.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",10,5,9,26 October 2015
Split," Sybil Unrest
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED IN BRIEF: James McAvoy's performance(s) is (are) the real reason to see this flawed thriller.SYNOPSIS: Three teenagers are kidnapped and held captive by a deranged loner.Dissociate Identity Disorder, a form of mental illness in which one has multiple personalities, is the inspiration for M. Night Shyamalan's latest psychological thriller, Split. While the premise for his film is always intriguing, the execution is as mix-up as his central character(s). One begins to wonder if the talented director/writer will ever find his true visionary self as well, but he is on his way to self discovery with this outing.Three teenagers (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula) are abducted by a man who suffers from multiple split personalities, 23 and counting. James McAvoy plays Kevin aka Dennis / Patricia / Barry / Hedwig and other various individuals that possess this man at a moment's notice. While this may be taking diversity to extremes, the film lays the groundwork for a taut thriller, especially with the director's use of atmospheric visuals. He creates tension very well. If only his screenplay would have avoided stock characters and predictable outcomes.After setting up an effectively creepy and overused story-line, Mr. Shyamalan relies too heavily on his characters' dumb reactions to situations that could have been easily (and logically) avoided during parts of the cat-and-mouse games. His screenplay has gaping leaps of logic and one too many plot contrivances that make little sense except to advance the action and make the film more suspenseful. Especially odd is the obsessive behavior of Kevin's psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), but you know where that is heading from their first session. There is a flashback story that fills in some exposition to one of the characters, but more development on that aspect was needed. Of course, there is also his trademark twist ending, and it worked well enough, just not very surprising or exciting.But it is Mr. McAvoy who impresses with his acting choices and he is terrific. With a wide range of quirks and subtlety, he play Kevin with the widest of strokes. Displaying extreme mood swings from childlike behavior or sudden violent tendencies, the actor brings the proper degree of menace and vulnerability in his many transitions. Ms. Taylor-Joy gives strong support as his sharp-witted adversary and Ms. Buckley adds greater depth to a standard rote role.Split is an entertaining psychological thriller that uses mental illness as a plot device for cheap thrills. And though Mr. Shyamalan remains in full control, except for a script that could have used a rewrite or two, it is his lead actor who rescues his film from its run-of-the-mill mediocre origins.",7,2,10,17 February 2017
Hugo," Hugo: Like A Tin Man In Search of a Heart
","This film is recommended.Time is of the essence and creativity is at the heart of Hugo, Martin Scorsese's so-called children's film about a boy and his robot. It's 1930 and Hugo Cabret ( Asa Butterfield ) is an orphan who secretly lives behind the clockwork of a Paris train station and dreams of a better life. Left alone by his inventor father, played by Jude Law, Hugo survives from day to day at the Gare Montparnasse. His father's lasting legacy to him is a robot in need of repair which Hugo diligently works on using stolen gears from a toy store at the station. One of the missing components is an elusive key to put all the gears into motion. Achieving that goal will take him on a journey unlike any before. It is at the train depot that he soon befriends a shop owner ( Ben Kingsley, giving a superb performance ) and his daughter, Isabelle ( Chloe Grace Moretz ). However, not everyone finds Hugo endearing, especially the station inspector who is always on the hunt for him. Sasha Baron Cohen plays the villain of the piece and provides the broad comedy and slapstick to entertain the younger members of the movie audience while the older moviegoers can be transported along with them to an imaginative world of adventure.Based on Brian Selznick best-selling book, The Inventions of Hugo Cabret, and adapted by John Logan, the film is breathtaking in its visual splendor, but rather mechanical and leaden in its story. The characters and sets seem to be inspired and resemble the detailed illustrations of another children's author, Chris VanAllberg. With the state-of-the-art technology on this big screen adaptation, the camera artfully glides and soars, showcases the 3-D experience to its maximum effect and in the hands of a master like Scorsese. All moviegoers will be totally enthralled by the CGI, even when the story begins to lose some momentum in its narrative focus. The tracking shots, especially the opening sequence, and the fluid camera movements are astonishing and literally carry the viewer into a journey to another dimension. Scorsese's impressive use of swinging pendulums, metal staircases and moving gears, his use of smoke and dust particles floating in the air, his aerial perspectives within the train station, all add to the film's sense of awe. ( By the way, Hugo's surrealistic dream sequence is pure artistry. ) This film's technical craftsmanship is the best use of 3-D since Avatar. Yet, my movie-going experience felt a bit incomplete due to the narrative structure of the film. At times, Hugo strays from the central plot and begins to meander. The children's adventure is at odds with its overt history lesson of early filmmaking. The two story lines never connect. The first half of the film is too leisurely paced and the minor characters remain only one- dimensional, continually upstaged by the lavish three-dimensional trappings. Children should be children, and children's films should be children's films, keeping their lighthearted nature with less pontificating. When Hugo takes itself too seriously, which is most of the time, it becomes somewhat inert. The film wants to work on another more sophisticated level with its love of film imagery and its heartfelt nostalgic view of the early days of filmmaking. While the film has moments that enchants as a children's fantasy should, to this adult in the audience, it became slightly desperate in its attempt to become more serious straining its credibility whenever it served as an homage to talents of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and specifically to Georges Méliès, a pioneer of early cinema. ( In fact, the shopkeeper is one and the same man and that plot device bears some truth. ) Scorsese has assembled a first-class team to handle the production values: music score by Howard Shore, absolutely terrific cinematography by Robert Richardson, editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, costumes by Sandy Powell, and an overall production design by Dante Ferretti, whose period sets are reminiscent of the old sepia stereoscopic images of time past. These are all gifted and accomplished artisans in their respective fields, and this film contains some of their finest work to date.Like its automaton, Hugo is a technically brilliant creation lacking in genuine emotion. Still, the film is quite captivating and an impressive achievement in modern day filmmaking. ( Make sure you take the time to see this film experience in its 3-D format and on the large screen for optimal effect. ) Hugo is a thrilling joyous ride into the world of 3-D and the vivid imagination of one of our foremost directors.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A Good Animated Film But...A Blur is a Blur is a Blur
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Standard storytelling and a misguided attempt to be innovative hampers mostly fine animation.JIM'S REVIEW: Why do most of today's animated films have strong visuals and a weak story?Saying Spiderman Into the Spider-verse is one of the better action hero movies is faint praise. The visual style is dazzling in this animated film and it achieves many similar effects just like its prior live action counterparts. But the film also maintains the same pitfalls by adhering too closely to predictable formulaic plotting found in most of this comic book hero genre. An overabundance of battle sequences fills most of the screen time and somewhere amid all the sound and fury is a charming tale about a likable character named Milo, an African-American teenager who gains superpowers and spends the entire movie learning to master them while fighting evil...so much for depth and originality.For me, Spiderman Into the Spider-verse was only partly successful. There has been much talk and critical acclaim that the animation on display in this version is ground-breaking in its eye-popping visuals. Yes, the vivid colors are truly intense in this moviegoing experience and the film captures a wonderful pop art sensibility and hard-edge comic book graphics, although some of the drawn characters have a Saturday morning cartoon flatness (especially Kingpin, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham).While most of the action is indeed fluid and smooth, the overall effect is like watching a 3-D movie...without the glasses. Backgrounds are often blurred and the edges around the characters are either fuzzy and non-descript or lined with annoying red and blue contours. The kinetic action is always set on overload, desperately searching for those audience members with very short attention spans or possible unexpected victims who are easily susceptible to epileptic seizures. (After discussing this issue with the theater manager, I was told that it was not a bad print or poor projection, rather it was the filmmakers' objective to use this state-of-the-art effect. I listened in disbelief and after researching this matter later that evening, I was apparently being told, believe it or not, accurate information...Sorry animators, but a blur is a blur is a blur...it is not a cinematic art.)Still the film remains true to its comic book origins and has moments of creative ingenuity. Kudos to the directors: Bob Percsichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman and their talented crew, although their excessive need to be technically innovative has the opposite effect for this reviewer. (A winter action sequence involving two Superheroes carried off on a runaway subway train and the dazzling climactic battle are definite highlights if one can overlook the pulsating background.) Voiceovers are well done but much of the dialog lacks witty banter. The script by Mr. Rothman and Phil Lord is serviceable but hardly memorable, with little character development and lots of frenzied action.Yes, style over substance prevails in this project, even if the movie's positive message that 'everyone can wear a mask' in order to do good in the world is a well-earned life-affirming credo. But every movie really needs a good script as well and Spiderman plays it too safe despite all of its razzle dazzle. The film's cool visuals cannot hide its predictability, conventional storytelling, and its basic squareness.",8,3,7,5 February 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," Crazy in Love
","This film is recommended.' Every cloud must have a silver lining, Wait until the sun shines through, Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear, Or else I shall be melancholy too! '<ul><li>Lyrics from My Melancholy Baby by E. Burnett, G. Norton, &amp; M.Watson</li></ul>Love is strange. The search for Mr. or Mrs. Right comes with many obstacles and every relationship comes with its own special baggage. Some of its contents are neatly folded and with room to spare, nicely hidden in each fold while others are ugly and messy and filled to the brim. It's the latter type of baggage that we find in Bill O. Russell's dramedy, Silver Linings Playbook, a romantic comedy that always entertains, even if it willingly sacrifices realism in favor of that evasive feel good feeling.Meet Pat and Tiffany, both bi-polar and both in need of love. Pat is just off a broken marriage for nearly a year, the result of his angry issues. Recently released from a mental institution due to a nervous breakdown, he encounters Tiffany, a tough-as-nails promiscuous widow, hasn't quite made it in the world of dating. Neither have the social skills or reserve to be seen as followers of the norm. In fact, they're the type of person that one avoids at all costs. Quirky with a capital Q, to put it nicely.In fact, everyone in this Philadelphia neighborhood seems to be off kilter. Dad ( a solid Robert DeNiro ), an avid Eagles fan with anger issues of his own, has OCD and a heavy gambling problem. Mom ( Jackie Weaver, good but underused ) is the typical loving enabler, trying to calm everyone around her. All of their friends and relatives have less than happy lives. There's nowhere to go but up in this part of town.Director / writer David O. Russell takes a very familiar scenario, two lovable misfits battling the odds, and plays it a little too safe. He seems more concerned with making a crowd- pleasing melodrama without any real consequences to his well-drawn characters. Russell's dialog is insightful and clever, quite poetic at times. but his plot structure is all over the place. He places his characters in different situations to force their reactions which ring false. Their highs and lows are mere plot devices to advance the story, but never go deeply into their mental instability or fragile state of mind. His intriguing lead characters deserve more than the film's predictable (and far fetched ) outcome.However, it is the two main actors and their natural chemistry together that takes Silver Linings Playbook to a more honest and emotional level for the movie-going audience. Both actors lash out at each other, creating a commanding presence on screen. Bradley Cooper has never been better. He conveys the angst and confusion, that twisted sense of optimism that his character needs to survive. Jennifer Lawrence plays her damaged character openly raw and masking the internal pain. It is a remarkable portrait of vulnerability and inner strength. Yet what makes their performances so strong and memorable are the subtle glances, the silences, and words not shared between the cruelty of their actions.If only the film would have been more courageous and truer to the issue of mental illness and its effects on loved ones, Silver Linings Playbook could have been a great film. It scores periodically whenever it starts to think outside the box and not follow the winning formula of most romantic comedies. But more often, the film is content to settle on staying inbounds and following that norm.

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," De-Witched and Bothered
","This film is not recommended.Once upon a time there was a film reviewer who hoped beyond hope that every new movie season would be filled with products that highlighted creativity and had some semblance of class. January would begin and he would hunt everywhere and every week for any film that brought with it a feeling of elation and worth rather than a nagging sensation of despair and dread. But, alas, he would have to wait until September or October before movie theaters would be showing award-worthy efforts. Sadly, there was no happily-ever-after until fall arrived.Which brings us to the first official film of 2013, a small turd of a film stinking up theaters this month entitled Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.There is no doubt that Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters would be wholeheartedly endorsed by Mr. LaPierre and his rowdy bunch at the NRA. Every villager has a right to bear arms, be they pitchforks, torches, or semiautomatic artillery in this formulaic movie. Most of the film's imagination seems to be aimed at the film's anachronistic state-of-the-art arsenal of weaponry with its super non-loading cross-bows and stylized guns a-blazing. These firearms would rival anything found in today's gun shows and make any proud gun-toter green with envy. It's shoot-em-up time! Let the blood spurt and the body count begin! God bless that Second Amendment!Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters wants moviegoers to believe that it is hip and clever in its revisionist spin of this classic children's tale. ( Okay, granted it's a nice touch with the missing children labels on the milk bottles! ) The look of the film is 13th century chic with its medieval themed village and appropriately dressed town-folk inappropriately mixing with today's gangsta vibe. After all, there are witches everywhere in this small generic Octoberfest of a town. Children have gone missing and the mayor has hired two bounty hunters by the name of Hansel and Gretel to clean-up this mess.Hansel is played by leading man Jeremy Renner, who is slumming here and misusing his talents, and the questionably talented Gemma Arterton, who hasn't made a good film since she played Strawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace, and that seems like forever, is Gretel. The actors offer bland facsimiles of their strictly cardboard stock characters and do not remotely show any dimensions, but this leather clad brother and sister duo are dressed to kill in style. Renner plays him character with tough guy dim-wittedness and Arterton is a tough cookie with a potty mouth and more cahones that her sibling. Famke Janssen plays the evil witch Muriel and, at least, brings some real menace to her role.With its mercilessly short running time of 88 minutes, director Tommy Wirkola keeps the story moving, but doesn't know how to establish characters or skillfully show off the well staged stunts. The camera remains too close to its actors and the kinetic editing and its onslaught of flash-cuts and CGI upstages all of the action. It's hard to watch all of the witch hunting when you're wondering which is hunting who.Legend has it that there are good witches and bad witches, although the bad usually outnumber the good 666 to 1. Legend also has it that movies of this ilk outnumber the good in about the same ratio whenever the new movie season begins in January. Unfortunately, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters upholds this sorry tradition. GRADE: CANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4,4,12,1 February 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Twisted Sister, Rebooted, Re-envisioned, and Reviewed
","The film is highly recommended.Many have questioned the rationale to remake this film. After all, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a well-made successful foreign film just two years ago, appearing on numerous best film lists. Did it really need to be redone? Too many subtitles? Too graphically violent for American audiences? Too much of a European sensibility? Too much of a cash cow to ignore?Rather than go into any of the detailed plot of Steig Larson's popular novel which most people already know, I decided to list 10 reasons for its existence:1. The director is David Fincher. No one does creepy better than this talented filmmaker. ( Think back to Se7en, Fight Club, and Zodiac to remind you. ) His films have shown a prurient bend in the past and he is a gifted director whose films have a diverse cult following. Fincher's visual tricks carry with them his unique style and he can say more without words than most directors. So this film treatment suits him to like a leather glove ( pun intended ).2. It stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. The diverse coupling of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander now is embodied by these two fine actors. Craig has the less flamboyant role as the journalist reporter and plays him with a dogged but world-weary spirit. . Mara plays out Lisbeth's rage in a fearless and bold performance. She also manages to hide the character's vulnerability beneath the sexual and emotional scars left by conspirators and powerful men in general. These actors' strong chemistry elevates this version to a slightly higher degree of excellence due to their credible and realistic portrayals. 3. The mystery still involves its audience. Did a family member kill Henrik Vanger's niece, Harriet, who disappeared almost 40 years ago? Blomkvist and Salander investigate and go on a convoluted journey to solve the case. These damaged individuals need to unravel the mystery as they begin to trust each other and tend to their own personal issues. Just as before, the initial story takes its time to have the characters converge and their subplots, while explaining their motivations, do little to advance the on-going mystery and subsequent investigation. 4. The supporting cast remains strong. Christopher Plummer, Robin Wright, the superb Stellan Skarsgard, Joely Richardson, Steven Berkoff, Geraldine James, and especially Yorick Van Wageningen all do yeoman-like service in their respective roles. Their casting is spot-on and the actors take special pleasure in defining their roles.5. There are some minor changes in both films. Some minor characters are missing in the American film and some flashback actions are merely mentioned rather than shown in the English language version. Both films have a different visual sense, with Fincher's film less conventional and more edgy and hyper-kinetic. Also, the Blomkvist role seems to be more expanded in this newer version and the romantic pairing of both investigators has been augmented and feels unmerited with its gratuitous moments of nudity. The film's ending differs from the novel also.6. The sexual content and violent nature of the film is on the edge of a NC-17 rating. This latest reincarnation is more graphic in sexual content and violent overtones than its Swedish predecessor. The camera seems to linger on Mara's body and exploits the actress, which became completely disturbing at times. However, that Mara / Salander connection yielded a veiled discomfort for the moviegoer, adding to the sinister subject matter while stressing the objectification of women in this society. 7. The film boasts an innovative score and a clever use of pop music. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create a dissonant and effectively soundtrack which adds so much to the visuals on screen. Their use of sound effects melding into the musical background heightens the tension. ( One misstep: the title music by Led Zeppelin in a 80's music video opening credits that is too reminiscent of a James Bond flix, failing to capture the film's more somber tone by choosing a stylish high fashion biker chic. One smart move: the use of Enya's new-age song, Orinoco Flow, to underscore a particularly unsettling and memorable moment in the film's climax. )8. Technical values are top-notch. As with Fincher's other films, his creative team never fails to astounded its movie-going audience. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth, editing by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall, and the production design by Donald Graham Burt are exemplary.9. There's nothing on television right now except reruns and marathons of vintage series. Enough said.10. We need an adult violent mystery / thriller to celebrate the holiday season. With so many films being family-oriented fare this December, it's refreshing that adult-oriented films are still available to view to a more discerning moviegoer. This film dazzles in its shocking content and its full- frontal assault on the viewers.Voyeuristic and racy, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has a takes-no-prisoners attitude. The violence is brutal and twisted. It makes no excuses for its sensationalized story and boldly stays the course. ( Be forewarned, the film is not for the prudish or the squeamish. ) The 2011 version has been visually updated and efficiently rebooted with only a slight improvement over the excellent Swedish import.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Implausible
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: This mission is improbable, but it's impossible not to be entertained due to the thrilling action and stunts.GRADE: B The mission may be impossible, and highly improbable, but it is unmistakably great fun. So start the action. Stage those death-defying stunts. Cue that recognizable theme music. Show those flashy opening credits. Mission Impossible has once again arrived. In its fifth incarnation, Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation, the IMF are now forced to disband and their primary spy, Ethan Hunt is a hunted man, a rogue agent out to save the world and accept that one last mission (should he decide to accept): to expose a group of political terrorists called The Syndicate.￼Following its successful formula of high octane action and intricate plotting (which makes little logical sense once one thinks about the logistics of the plan), Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, the fifth installment of this film series, takes the movie-going audience to exotic locales (Belarus, Vienna, Morocco, London) with nifty technology and enough excitingly- staged chase scenes for three more movies, let alone one. Yes, none of it makes much sense, especially Agent Hunt's endless financial resources and expensive gadgetry he has accumulated, but the far-fetched story remains very enjoyable nevertheless.￼Ethan is played by the never-aging Tom Cruise and he plays this action hero figure to perfection. Sure, no one could survive these stunts in real life (hanging outside a moving plane in midair, being underwater for an insufferable amount of time, surviving one motorcycle or car crash without any broken bones, etc.) But this adventure isn't remotely real, It's more James Bond fantasy than actual espionage caper, although it desperately wants us to believe it is the latter. Cruise inhabits this physically exhausting role with great bravado. Keeping up with his pace (and almost stealing the film away from this movie star) is Rebecca Ferguson, a talented actress new to me. Ms Ferguson plays Ilsa Faust, a devilish double agent who can whoop HUnt blow-for-blow. She brings as much believability as humanly possible in an unbelievable role. Simon Pegg supplies the humor adroitly. and makes a great sidekick to the gravely serious Hunt. James Renner, Ving Rhames, and Alec Baldwin are there to provide minor support. The only real flaw is the film's chief villain, Solomon Lane, played by Sean Harris. The actor plays him as a second-rung evildoer, common without any real menace or malicious glee.Christopher McQuarrie wrote a serviceable screenplay with enough twists to engage us. Yet it is his direction that impresses with much ballyhoo and expertly choreographed non-stop action. The film's highpoint, an assassination set piece at the Vienna Opera that juggles multiple deadly threats and exhilarating fight sequences backstage during a performance of Turandot, owes its inspiration to Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, a sly homage from a talented modern day director that would have pleased the master director of suspense with his nimble touch.Yes, the glorious stunts are as complex as they are absurd, wanting to top each preceding daredevil feat just to give us our money's worth of thrills. And while the mission itself becomes more outrageous and implausible, Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation accomplishes its real mission: to entertain and thrill us.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,0,1,5 August 2015
Dunkirk," War is Hell
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: A- THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A visually accomplished film that focuses on its 'war is hell' theme with memorable details.SYNOPSIS: The Battle of Dunkirk, as seen by its fighting soldiers on land, on sea, and in the air.JIM'S REVIEW: Dunkirk shows the horrors of war as soldiers are stranded on the beaches of a French coastal town and waiting for the smallest sign of rescue. Yes, it will come, but slowly, as lives are lost and saved. The Germans are in control here, having the advantage to easily aim and fire at the helpless British troops (along with their French, Belgian and Canadian allies). Courage is in abundance as both civilian and military forces come to their aid. Such is war. Such is Christopher Nolan's exceptional film.Mr. Nolan's vision interweaves three distinct viewpoints of the Allied evacuation, from land, sea, and air, all occurring in diverging time frames. His skill as a director establishes this battlefront in three chapters and he masterfully juggles his action scenes with his mini-cast of characters in each segment, all of which leads to a stirring denouncement.The film is divided into three chapters. 'The Mole: One week' focuses on one young recruit, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and his band of brothers, including One Direction's former member, Harry Styles), as they scurry to avoid bullets and falling explosives. The second part, 'The Sea: One Day', tells its story of a brave captain (Mark Rylance) and his crew (Tom Glynn-Carrey, Barry Keoghan) who are in rescue mode to save the soldiers, although a recent survivor (Cillian Murphy) of this slaughter protests their mission. Two pilots (Tom Hardy, Jack Lowman) lead a dogfight against the German planes from above in the third portion, 'The Air: One Hour'. The structure of Dunkirk takes these three individual story lines and meshes them together so seamlessly that the moviegoer follows these one-act dramas with full attention as they converge into a satisfying whole.Mr. Nolan's skills as a director are impressive as he captures this historic piece of World War II lore. For me, the film was very reminiscent of the fine 1962 war saga, The Longest Day, which showed World War II in a fragmented style of battle scenes from various points of view with a matter-of-fact authenticity. (That classic film dealt with the D-Day landings in Normandy.) Dunkirk's powerful visual swept is also comparable to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, one of the greatest war films ever made. This film is superior filmmaking in every sense of the word. (Be forewarned; there is violence due to its subject matter, but it's not as graphic as most war films in recent memory.)Technically, Dunkirk is a remarkable achievement. The images are photographed with stunning details by Hoyte van Hoytema and the taut editing by Lee Smith ratchets up the suspense. Hans Zimmer's bombastic score and the astonishing sound design complement each other to heighten the tension as well. Mr. Nolan's screenplay is more action than words, but he is one of the foremost visual storyteller in today's cinema. His images are memorable (a horrifying crash landing on water, a sandy beach littered with discarded helmets, war leaflets showering down on some infantrymen walking nonchalantly down a strangely quiet street, the hand of a drowning soldier suddenly becoming motionless in the dark murky waters). Come award season, this film will garner many accolades.One minor flaw: Due to Mr. Nolan's clinical approach on his subject, the personal human drama is missing from his screenplay. He is more intent of showing the casualties of war. One wishes more screen time was spent on fleshing out the characters and adding some back stories to the major roles. As it is now, they all become stock characters representative of the bigger picture whose sole purpose is to deliver the film's main theme: war is hell but the human spirit will triumphantly survive. The acting, including Kenneth Branagh, Mr. Lowden, and Mr. Rylance, is fine but it never rises to an emotional level due to the narrative structure of the film. The actors are continually upstaged by the physical sweep of the event.Dunkirk recreates one epic battle in the hands of one epic director at the top of his game. It is one of the year's best films and will deservedly become a film classic for many generations to come. NOTE: See this film in IMAX format.",10,2,7,22 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Super Powers Indeed!
","This film is highly recommended.'Amazing' is such an overused adjective that rarely is in sync with its subject. The Amazing Kreskin...The Amazing Race...Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat...The Amazing Colossal Man...The Amazing Colossal Woman. Never achieving its own sense of greatness, the word attains a self-congratulatory smugness and usually leads to disappointment. And now we have The Amazing Spiderman, yet another trendy remake of a comic book superhero, a re-boot of this film trilogy that is barely a decade old!Now, The Age of the Comic Book Hero Movie may seem like the latest fad, but it's been with us for years, although their emergence feels all too frequent due to the many misfires and hyperbole. These fantasy action blockbusters occur with such regularity that it's far easier to count the films that aren't from that genre than to observe the glut of fanboy extravaganzas that take up space in today's movie theaters.( Yes, I do fondly remember, somewhere back in the fifties, between double features and sitting in the fourth row of the Palace Theater, being one of those very young and easily gullible movie fans, watching a national yo-yo competition after that first feature, as kid after kid would walk up on that stage to 'amaze' the audience with tricks like Walking the Dog, Boingy Boing, and The Sleeper. ( I, on the other hand, being so uncoordinated, was lucky to get this spinning toy back up the string into my wet waiting palm! ) And then...we waited for the main event, the second feature to appear on the big screen: Superman and the Mole People ( starring George Reeves with his strings attached ) as our superhero conquered the enemies by actually flying in the air amid the squeals and shouts of all the neighbor boys in that crowded movie house. But I digress....)The young audience of today is much more savvy and the expensive budget lavished on special effects are superior to those visible invisible wires attached to our superheroes that we chose to ignore as children. But the thrill is still the same for youngsters and, nowadays, oldsters alike. Which finally brings us full circle to our main event, The Amazing Spiderman, an entertaining and special film that takes its legend seriously and its source as gospel. It's popcorn entertainment alright, but with some degree of sophistication and unexpected joy. This time they got it right and The Amazing Spiderman, illogic withstanding, is one of the best action films of the summer!I won't belabor the plot of the film as we have seen it all before, although there are some clever minor changes. Let's just say Peter Parker gets bit by that radioactive, or biologically engineered, spider and adapts to his life as misunderstood webbed crusader, meeting various nemeses and fighting against the forces of evil. The film truly takes flight in its early scenes of Spidey's self-discovery of his new strength and agility in these introductory phases. ( A delightful subway sequences uses humor and CGI to reinforce the elements of awe and wonder simultaneously as Parker's initiation into superhero mode begins. )Some differences from the original: a new love interest, namely Gwen Stacy ( Emma Stone ), a new villain, The Lizard a.k.a. Dr. Curt Connors ( very well played by Rhys Ifan ), and, of course, a new actor in the title role, smashingly played Andrew Garfield. These additions help make this Spiderman 4.0 all the more enjoyable. High praise goes to the film's director, Marc Webb, who wisely invests in the characters and their dilemmas before much superhero action takes place. This makes many of the later scenes have more dramatic clout. The screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves adds plenty of subtle humor in its exchanges between the two lovers and creates an interesting conflicted villain who is not just the persona of evil. It is so refreshing that the director and screenwriters actually take the time to delve into the backgrounds of the characters involved before going into the fancy aerial acrobatic maneuvers and sci-fi plotting They realize the human story is as important as the theatrics. It is the relationship of Peter and Gwen that elevates the film to an entirely different level from most ordinary comic book hero films. Although Stone and Garfield are too old for their teenage roles, they play off each other so well. Stone brings to her role a charm and intelligence that beguiles the audience. Garfield, pardon the pun, is a Marvel as Spiderman. This talented actor plays him as a rebel with a cause, a modern day James Dean in uniform. Garfield captures the pent-up energies of an adolescent loner with his gawky posturing and nervous tics. His ability to convey sensitivity and inner turmoil, plus his good looks, define this role to the max.I would be amiss if I did not point out that here are some glaring inconsistencies throughout The Amazing Spiderman, who, I might add, is even a more 'amazing' fashion designer with his seamless removable mask and sewing skills. Some minor villains and future plot complications are introduced and then disappear into that dark night. Photographed with a breathtaking fluidity by John Schwartzman, the action set pieces are exciting and well staged, with wonderful visual effects, but the climactic showdown defies logic and goes on too long. The Amazing Spiderman definitely lives up to its own hype. It may not meet the 'amazing' standard of excellence but it is a marvelous Marvel for us to behold. No strings attached.

The Lego Movie," Blockheads
","This film is not recommended.Loud, hyperactive, and occasionally amusing, The LEGO Movie was surprisingly highly lauded by many critics and became a huge hit. Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film tackles grandiose ideas of fascism, conformity, and corporate greed for the pre-school set, but the humor is mainly aimed for their parents with so many pop references and nostalgic touches. With nice voice-over work by Chris Pratt, Will Farrell, and especially Will Arnett as the gravel- voiced Batman, The LEGO Movie has some satirical things to say, that is, whenever it calms down to say them. There is so many frenzied chase scenes and shoot-um-up sequences that they overpower the slim story. We are dropped into Lego World where our hero, Emmet, a dim-witted but contented construction worker type runs into an evil dictator named President Business who wants to control this world. He unites the other Lego figures to fight with him against this tyrant.The crude animation is a disappointment. One sees far more clever results on cable television's Cartoon Network or Matt Groeing's far superior Futurama or The Simpsons programs. While the computer generated / live action film stays within the confines of the Lego block design, this option also limits the creative spark. Movement is clunky and awkward like the short, stocky, and generally unappealing Lego figures themselves. The film seems rather schizophrenic, like one of its characters, a two faced Good Cop / Bad Cop figure. It wants to condemn big business and consumerism while willfully selling its product to anyone in the neighborhood.The film resembles the noisy Transformers franchise, both in its overall look, sound design, and hectic movements, with its main goal being its tie-ins and product endorsements. In fact, The LEGO Movie appears to be one long commercial of Legos, by Legos, and for Legos, with a new shipment of characters arriving at the nearest toy store and a new sequel already in progress.

Dallas Buyers Club," Tex-Mix
","This film is mildly recommended.In Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey's first appearance is downright shocking: a pale skeletal image of this actor's former robust muscular self. We're use to seeing this good old country boy cavorting, drinking, and leading the wild life from his other film roles. But here, we also see the ugly side of this screen persona: drug abuse and rough sex amid bitter vitriolic and bigoted remarks. The actor has taken on the serious role of AIDS patient Ron Woodroof, a real life character who fought a courageous battle more so against the bureaucratic FDA than the disease itself. As portrayed in this film, Woodroof is an arrogant Texas womanizer, a mean homophobe, a narcissist, and a heroin addict. He is a man with no moral center, no sense of compassion. a man filled with swagger and ego. Suddenly told he has 30 days to live, Ron lashes out at anyone he can: doctors, friends, gays. No, Ron is not the least bit likable, nor caring. He takes matters into his own hands: refusing AZT treatments, taking on the medical and governmental establishments, going across the border to get illegal drugs to help his immune system, starting a prescription service for his contraband, becoming a richer man in the process.Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, the film shows the prejudice against AIDS patients and clearly presents the anger. What it doesn't do is connect the political roadblocks and emotionally tie you to its main character and his plight. Woodroof's conversion from homophobe to crusader never seems real. It's as if some pieces are missing to this enigmatic character. Certainly, it's not the fault of McConaughey's gripping performance. The actor never plays it safe in his acting choices, even though the film plays it safe with its narrative structure and factual information. The screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack tends to overlook important details as its encompasses the years from Woodroof's initial doctor's visit to his extended and borrowed time as a political militant. Dallas Buyers Club just stays too clinical and remote in its storytelling of this 80's epidemic. Woodroof's ultimate redemption seems to hinge upon his friendships with a kind doctor (a winning Jennifer Garner) and Rayon (Jared Leto), a transgender individual who also suffers from this fatal disease. Leto's acting as the self-destructive Rayon is astounding, even more effectively conveyed, although I am not diminishing Mr. McConaughey's triumphant portrayal with this statement. Mr. Leto successfully avoids the gay stereotype of the wise-cracking, sage effeminate and inhabits the role with a tenderness and vitality, and also has the necessary poignancy which he adds to the nuances of his character. The physical changes of the two actors, who lost nearly over 80 pounds between them, is startling and helps to give, pardon the pun, some heft to its conventional story.Dallas Buyers Club is a worthwhile film to see. It boasts two of this year's finest performances and deals with a complex and important issue, even if the end result tends to simplify and gloss over its serious subject.

Captain America: Civil War," A League to Disown
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: More of the same, but there is some skill and care by the filmmakers to develop characters between all the standard action stuff.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: The superheroes are called to task about the repercussions of their questionable actions which leads to a splintering of the league.JIM'S REVIEW: Today, many moviegoers above the age of forty, like myself, can easily develop a condition known as PTSHD (Post Traumatic Super Hero Disorder), a malady that weakens many seriously-minded cinephiles who are continually force-fed the barrage of comic book blockbusters playing at our local movie theaters. Side effects include: vertigo (caused by multiple hyper-kinetic CGI battles), nausea (due to shaky hand-held camera-work), a lack of stamina and general listless yearning for sophisticated dialog (instead of snide puns and comic one-liners) and a feeling of isolation and abandonment (as one feels adrift from today's younger generation of moviegoers).If I am at all honest in my review, after seeing so many superhero blockbusters of late, in this era of pop entertainment instant gratification, I must admit that I have indeed reached my saturation point. The formula for success is repeated with successful variations on a theme: A rowdy band of misfits is assembled to become their own weapon of mass destruction, destroying cities in one fell swoop. Endless repartee is bantered between our crusaders. Actors fit into their tight-fitted spandex to fight the forces of evil with the straightest of faces and sexual identities to match. Granted, I am not the target audience that the filmmakers have in mind. But here I am, ready to plunk down my well-earned dollars to see another epic sampling of comic book justice. This time around, the group resembles one big unhappy family dealing with sibling rivalry issues and minor dysfunction. Captain America: Civil War is entertaining, if somewhat over-indulgent in its messy strained relationship between Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark a.k.a. Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.). Their animosity causes a ripple effect with the other superheroes taking sides...and gee-whiz, is there an over abundance of muscle, power, and ego! Fanboys, behold the testosterone level on display: Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Vision (Paul Bettany). Women and diversity are well represented in this Marvel universe: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and War Machine (Don Cheadle), Newcomers to this action figure franchise include: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) for the millennial set. Batteries not included.The plot borrows a similar scenario from the DC comic book universe's recent movie entry, Batman v Superman, the premise being the high collateral damage inflicted upon the town-folks by their so-called protectors. Many lives have been destroyed as they battle evil forces. So there is now a public outcry and revenge against the Avengers. It's governmental and political control over our vigilante crime fighters, some of which accept the terms of a UN mandate while others want to secede from that union. Their decision to either conform with this global request or go rogue causes the friction and tension that finally dissolves their alliance. ￼Credit screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for spending considerable time to build the interrelationships and inner angst, even if there are far too many Avengers to do full justice to their individual back-stories. Most characters seem to be fighting for equal screen time than actually fighting a cause. At times, the film feels a bit desperate and overstuffed. It is always on maximum overload, which has both positive and negative results. One just wishes less superheroes were called to duty so the film could be more focused. ￼ The fight sequences themselves are uneven. The opening battle is poorly edited and filmed in harsh close-ups that obliterates the action. But the film improves greatly from there. In fact, the main combat between the divided team of superheroes, which takes place at a deserted airport, is a brilliantly staged and extensively well choreographed scene that is worth the wait (even if it takes over an hour to get there). There is also a strong climactic smack-down between a few of the Avengers that delivers, even if the build and final twist misses some fine opportunities to unite the splintered crew for one final memorable free-for-all.Both Evans and Downey as the opposing leaders bring their A-game to the A-Team. They have a nice chemistry that makes their rift involving. The rest of the cast play their parts well. However, Daniel Bruhl is miscast as the villain, Helmut Zemo, who never establishes any real presence or menace. He remains an enigma right to the end. ￼Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, with enough whiz-bang expertise to make the film diverting and satisfying, Captain America: Civil War proves to be a film that would rather debate the deeper issue of friendship and family than settle for being just another simple slam-bang blockbuster. That factor helps elevate this action fantasy and takes it a rise above the standard genre. The playing field may be overcrowded as everyone dukes it out, but it is still enough of a crowd-pleaser, even for this older and slightly worn-out reviewer.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,3,8,7 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," No Real Mag (But Fun)
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Not really magical, but there's enough spirit and fun in this  fantasy adventure.  GRADE: B-   SYNOPSIS: A prequel to the Harry Potter franchise that offers a new  wizard to believe in.  JIM'S REVIEW: Brevity and simplicity have never been J. K. Rowling's  strength. The more complex her plot is, the better she feels. A  prolific and creative writer, she creates interesting stories and  evokes involving characters in her works. That remains a constant  factor in her latest venture, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,  although the final results seems like a work-in-progress rather than a  finished product.  ￼Well, there are plenty of creatures afoot, and far many plot strands  and characters that take their time to take shape. (Apparently, this is  the first of a five set franchise, a prequel of sorts to the Harry  Potter series. Perhaps this might explain some minor characters like  Jon Voight's ambitious politician or the Barebone children having  rather minor roles in this outing, as they really do nothing to advance  the plot.)  The story (stories) goes like this: Plot 1 (the main one): Armed with  his suitcase of magical creatures, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne)  visits 1920's New York City, only to lose some along the way. He  befriends Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj (as in non-magical human), who helps  him to capture these animal escapees. Plot 2: A evil wizard named  Gellert Grindelwald has also escaped and is a wanted fugitive. Plot 3:  Mary Lou Barebone has a mission to warn others of these evil wizards  among us. She is the zealous type, one that would make Carrie's mother  envious. She also raises some spooky children, including an adoptive  son named Credence. Plot 4: Two mystical sisters, Tina Goldstein and  his mind-reading sibling, Queenie, become comrades to Newt and Jacob  and also serve as their love interests. Plot 5: Percival Graves, a  ruthless wizard is searching for a black destructive force called an  Obscurus that is causing mayhem to the metropolis. That's a lot to take  in...and the film succeeds as the film progresses, although getting  there is a journey in itself.  ￼The first half of the film is a bit of a muddle, or Muggle as in  No-Mag (as in no cinematic magic). Ms. Rowling lays the foundation of  things to come, but the dialog is more serviceable than compelling.  Characters speak in large patches of heavy exposition and plotting to  further explain the overloaded narrative, without much real excitement  or conviction. There are far too many chase sequences to show off the  CGI in order to catch various fabulous escaped creatures which actually  hinders the main story. (The film's leisurely pace relies too much on  cutesy adventures to disguise its darker underbelly. It is not until we  enter a speakeasy setting, about an hour into the movie, that the film  shows some cleverness and wit. Only then did it start to reel in this  moviegoer.)   ￼Production values are strong. David Yates' direction is solid, if  somewhat conventional. He and a screenplay, credited to a lady named  Rowling, let the action dissipate by having several subplots which  interfere with the efficiency of the storytelling and some chase scenes  that go on too long. But the director does cast his film very well. In  fact, the minor characters upstage the central characters (and the CGI  as well).   While Mr. Redmayne's interpretation of Newt may seem underwhelming and  demure for his own good, he is nevertheless entertaining. So is  Katherine Waterson as his partner. Yet their characters come off as  slightly wan, especially compared to the more showier roles around  them. Colin Farrell helps immensely as Newt's foe and Ezra Miller  brings the sadness and vulnerability to his role. There is also fine  support by Samantha Morton and Ron Perlman. But the real magic to the  film is the lovely chemistry between Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol as the  mismatched sweethearts. They simply steal the film with their subtle  and nuanced performances.   ￼Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a nice romp. This fantasy  is not fantastic entertainment, nor, for that matter, is it beastly,  but you know where to find them...in Ms. Rowling's fertile  imagination...with Part Two soon to be on a movie screen near you, in a  year or two.",7,0,3,22 November 2016
Jackie," Jackie Oh!
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A magnifcent performance gets sidelined with weak storytelling.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Jackie Kennedy's days immediately following the assassination of her husband.JIM'S REVIEW: There is much to admire in Pablo Larrain's insightful docudrama, Jackie, just as there is much to disapprove of. We focus on the tragic last days of one of as America's most popular and sophisticated First Ladies, Jacqueline Kennedy (Onassis). We follow her ordeal and witness her grief over the assassination of her husband and our country's 35th president. November 22, 1963. Always fashionably attired, Jackie prepares for that fateful drive in Dallas, dressing in that soon-to-be iconic pink and black Chanel outfit and matching pillbox hat. It signals to the movie-going audience what is to be, as we are helplessly drawn into the series of events leading up to her husband's untimely murder. Through flashbacks and using her interview with a journalist from Life Magazine as its plot device, the film depicts Jackie as mother, wife, and political figure. It addresses her personal struggles: her philandering husband, Jack (an underused Caspar Phillipson as a perfect doppelganger), her well-to-do marriage of convenience, her stalwart devotion to her children, her image as part of America's royal family, her political savvy and desperation to preserve her husband's legacy.Jackie Kennedy became an American legend, a symbol of strength and grace. She also led a most uncommon life filled with its share of highs (fashion icon and trendsetter, Emmy winner, advocate of the arts, a successful book editor, a millionaire's wife) and lows (an indifferent marriage, the premature death of both her husband, two of her children, and a stepson, the violent death of her brother-in-law, a fall from grace due to a second marriage and her reincarnation as Jackie O., the target of the paparazzi). In this film, some of this is alluded to, most is ignored due to the director and his screenwriter, Noah Oppenheim, and their decision to limit the scope of this character study. ￼As a docudrama, the film takes numerous liberties in its telling of the tale. Yet the script repeatedly overplays the melodrama. Its non-linear aspects of the narrative structure do not help matters, nor does the choppy editing by Sebastián Sepúlveda which includes archival footage that never seamlessly blends with Mr. Larrain's actual reenactments.While this bio-pic establishes Jackie's anguish and grief succinctly, there are many missed opportunities. The exposition and details needed to flesh out her relationship to Jack Kennedy just are not there. Much of the supporting characters are underdeveloped. More time is spent on her relationship with her brother-in-law, Bobby, who comes across more kindly and positive than corrupt and malicious as history has indicated. Her adversarial run-ins with LBJ are MIA. ￼In general, the acting is a mixed bag of strong and weak performances, mostly due to the sketchiness of the written supporting characters. Greta Gerwig and Bill Crudup offer fine work while Peter Sarsgaard and John Carroll Lynch are less successful with their impersonations of Robert Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. John Hurt's role as Jackie fictitious spiritual adviser seems to be only a writer's prop into Jackie's state of mind and never is remotely a believable character.So the film's success rests entirely on Ms. Portman's vivid portrayal as Jackie Kennedy and the actress is a revelation. Ms. Portman's voice modulates from breathy precise diction for the general public and a deeper timbre in her everyday speech patterns behind closed doors. The actress captures her quiet inflections and public mannerism while investing in all of the emotional upheaval of a woman in mourning. It is a remarkable achievement in acting and deserves to be recognized.￼What makes this film so riveting, besides the towering performance of Natalie Portman in the title role, is the behind-the-scenes feel of the film. Perhaps the film's most telling concept is the tell-all depiction of Jackie herself and her calculating desperation to control her private and personal world. The actress daringly allows her character to be unlikable. Her obsession to create a Camelot existence and its dreamlike quest for an Utopian fantasy becomes the thing dreams are made of. It not only legitimizes her husband's fame and historical gravitas, but hers as well and the film brings off this aspect very well.￼Great care has also been taken by the director to replicate the real life characters and events of the era. Mr. Larrain gives his film style and substance, convincingly echoing the personas of the Kennedy clan. The hair and make-up design and period costumes by Madeline Fontaine are meticulously rendered and make Mr. Larrain's images more recognizable for any moviegoer. The production design by Jean Rabasse completes the overall effect. However, Stéphane Fontaine's photography becomes too artfully heavy-handed with severe in-your-face close-ups. Even more off-putting is Mica Levi's score which is made up of loud dissonant high-pitched chords that produce a strangely eerie sound that would be more appropriate in a science fiction / horror movie genre than in a historical biography.￼Jackie is a flawed but literate retelling of a woman of the edge, trying to make sense of the chaos spinning around her. It boasts of the the best performance of the year. See it to appreciate two great women as one, Ms. Portman and Mrs. Jacquelyn Kennedy. It is well worth the visit.",8,1,5,27 December 2016
Inside Out," Mind Set
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4) This film is recommended.In brief: Insightful and thought-provoking, but not as mind-blowing as expected.GRADE: BCritics have been raving about the latest Disney / Pixar offering, Inside Out. While it doesn't take one to the dizzying heights of animation perfection like the award-winning Holy Trinity of Animation (Toy Story, Up, and Ratatouille), it still is entertaining and insightful, far better than most standard animated films these days. ￼Literally, the moviegoers are given a introspective tour into the mind of an 11 year old girl named Riley. This fantastic voyage takes us into the brain's central work station manned by Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). This quartet of emotions help keep Riley in balance.That is until Riley's outside world starts to come undone with real-life issues changing her life. Inside, things are beginning to disintegrate as well when Sadness accidentally starts a domino effect that alters Riley's behavior and mood swings. (The fact that Riley is headed for those teenage angst years doesn't help matters either.) So Joy takes over to try and rectify this imbalance causing even more issues.￼Well directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronaldo Del Carmen, Inside Out is animation with adults in mind. The screenplay by Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and the director, takes an intriguing premise but never fully succeeds in expanding its mind games. And while the intentions are good, the end result is a bit scattered. With all the language about core memories, deductive reasoning, and abstract thinking being bantered about, one wonders if a psychology major is required for the minors in the audience. The film's target audience may have been children, but only those with the highest of IQ's. The voice-over work is consistently strong, especially Poehler, Smith, and Kaitlyn Dias as Riley. However, while some of the emotions are well defined like Joy and Sadness, the other trio is regulated to secondary roles that are less nuanced. Other major emotions are never even represented or acknowledged for that matter. Paging Sigmund!￼The real scene stealer of the film (in Freudian terms, our Id) is Bing Bong (wonderful vocal work too by Richard Kind), a pink confection of cotton candy and various animal parts who cries candy tears and was once Riley's imaginary best friend. This character is the heart of the film and the emotional center of Inside Out. The film laments the loss of childhood in the subtlest of ways and effectively taps into any moviegoer's emotional 'core'. ￼The film's animation is as highly accomplished as we expect from the Disney / Pixar Studios. Its textural details and imaginative Rube Goldberg devices show the inter-workings of a child's mind with its floating islands, glowing orbs, and neon lit chutes and ladders...a Disneyland for the mind. Its stylized humans have enough realistic touches to make their characters seem authentic especially in sharp contrast to the cartoon qualities of the more obviously color-coded crew. The musical score by the talented Michael Giacchino superbly links its haunting melodies with the visual images on display. It is also refreshing that this film never resorts to inane slapstick chases and sophomoric humor, so prevalent in today's animation.￼Inside Out shows the ins and outs of growing up in a refreshing and intelligent way in which adults can easily relate while their young children will pass the time wondering why their parents are enjoying the film more than they are.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,13,39,2 July 2015
Yesterday," Fixing A Whole
","GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Although quite charming, the filmmakers should have known better.JIM'S REVIEW: Yesterday plays with a very intriguing premise: Living in a parallel universe, a musician discovers a world untouched by the music of The Beatles and begins to pirate their tunes as his own. It's a rags to riches cautionary tale, with the typical greed and fame overtaking the singer on the rise from becoming a Nowhere Man into Something.Himesh Patel plays Jack Malik, a down-on-his-luck musician ready to give up on his musical career. His best friend and loyal manager, Ellie (Lily James) encourages him to follow his dream as she falls in love with him. One night, during a global blackout, Jack's path leads him directly into a local bus and he awakens to a world without the Beatles.But the fallacy with this concept is that songs themselves evolved, just as the band did. (Compare the simplistic sing-song melody of She Loves You with any of the complex sounds from Sgt. Peppers or Abbey Road and one can readily see that aspect.) The pop / folk basis is there, but the innovative engineering, catchy harmonies, and musical skills that made the difference between commonplace and art falls short. Also, The Beatles were not just a rock band. They were also trendsetters and led the counter culture youth movement. They were a marketing package hyped and promoted as a new iconic group of talented English laddies with their unique style, mod look, and loads of charisma which influenced a generation. Yesterday only proves that The Beatles were an important product of their times, before computers and social media ever existed.In fact, the problem with any film that flaunt the 'what if' origins is that any moviegoer must work hard not to see the obvious illogical plot-holes in order to enjoy the set-up. Like the Fab Four, certain people and things are fully erased from memory while others exist and remain unaffected and unexplained. (Yes, to the Rolling Stones, no to Coca-Cola...why? Other questions that come to mind: Why doesn't Jack introduce some of his own compositions along with the plagiarized stolen tunes? If others learn about this scam, why not expose the culprit who dishonors the band's true legacy? Why does the odd quality of the songs with their mix of early and later tracks never become an issue?)The song's new arrangement and solo vocals never come near the greatness of the original musical sources. This failed to convince this reviewer of Jack's instant phenomenon and mass adoration. The screenplay by Richard Curtis never bothers to address these and other unethical issues. It is more concerned with celebrating the Beatles songbook and using their familiar and popular songs to enhance its paper-thin romantic story.Yesterday gets lost in rom-com territory rather quickly. And to its merit, the love story is charming, if predictable. Mr. Patel is fine in the lead and his voice and screen presence is more than serviceable. But his talent is lackluster compared to John, Paul, George, or Ringo, which does not help the audience buy into Jack's superstardom (or me). The real star quality comes from a delightful Ms. James who takes her underwritten role and makes her character believable and enchanting. Other supporting parts fail to register, except for a scene-stealing turn by Kate McKinnon as a greedy American agent who provides the needed comedy that Joel Fry as Jack's goofy sidekick fails to deliver. Ed Sheeran plays himself and has some amusing moments.Danny Boyle directs with his customary flair, but even his flashy style cannot hide the film's obvious flaws. Still, Yesterday always entertains, even as it tries to cajole its audience into believing its shaky rom-com narrative. For me, it just didn't all Come Together.",7,0,1,4 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The End is Not in Sight
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Technically well done, this sci-fi blockbuster will entertain most moviegoers, especially its rabid fanbase.JIM'S REVIEW: Before sharing my critic-proof and spoiler-proof review of this year's biggest blockbuster sequel, let me state that Avengers: Endgame is a worthy follow-up to 2018's mega-hit, Avengers: Infinity Wars. Fans needed to wait a whole year for Part Two for answers to questions which left them hanging in fine cliff-hanging tradition.But first, my own nagging question...does anyone really die in sci-fi ?Resurrection and The Moral Good must triumph. Besides, everyone loves a comeback. After all, this is a fantasy adventure in a sci-fi world and there is a set formula. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley take the inevitable logical plot device to foil Thanos' plan at universal domination, which shouldn't surprise anyone who has read comic books as a child. Many battles will ensue, which makes up most of the film's action and sub-plots. (However, it must be said, that there was one glaring leap of logic involving one unnamed character stealing the Tesseract, the movie's McGuffin, that remains unanswered.)Epic in scope and length (nearly 3 hours), the film is a satisfying thrill ride, although it does take awhile to assemble the gang. Much (too much) time is spent with sketchy character development and tons of exposition. While most of the storytelling seizes upon engaging interactions with its more colorful assortment of characters, there are still some missed opportunities. The film is also anti-climactic and could have used some judicious editing despite its crowd-pleasing goals to tidy up all loose ends.Still, Avengers: Endgame is an amazing accomplishment which should please the series' fanbase. The filmmakers assembles many, if not all, of the Marvel superheroes, both major and minor. The actors reprise their roles with varying degrees of importance and excitement. Some register as insignificant cameos and walk-ons; others provide strong contributions to the film; a few characters simply mystify their existence within the Marvel family. The film makes strides to impress its audience with its sheer magnitude and cast of thousands and takes its own mythology very seriously and, for the most part, succeeds.Technically adept, much of the movie has top-notch CGI visuals and well staged action sequences directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Also impressive is their seamless handling of previous footage from other Marvel movies and their reenactments within a parallel dimension. The music score by Alan Silvestri is highly effective and Trent Opaloch's cinematography adds atmosphere and style. The editing team of Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt keep the interlocking episodes moving and allow the action to be clearly viewed, a rarity in today's blurry techno-shoot-em-ups.Some of the actors provide more memorable star turns than others. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo, and Josh Brolin do a yeoman-like job. Jeremy Renner may sport a new hair-do-over, but his low-tier character still lacks considerable interest, The heroines portrayed by Scarlett Johansson, Elizabeth Olsen, and Brie Larson remain underwritten and underwhelming, despite a very forced woman's empowerment battle moment that serves only as a contrived sign of the times.Avengers: Endgame is far from the final stage of this film franchise. As comic book superhero movies go, this is one of the better efforts. In this 'final' version, some superheroes perish, a few fade from memory, but most survive...as does this series. It will goes on...and on, making this one of the most profitable franchises in movie history.So let me re-phase my opening question in this review: Does any sci-fi really die?",8,0,8,27 April 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Hobbit: The Desperation of Slough
","This film is recommendedMore is more in Peter Jackson's second installment to his latest fantasy trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The director has better success this time around. Jackson still know how to move his camera and stage his action masterfully and he has again assembled a gifted crew of artists that create wonders with their respective talents; the production values, especially in the areas of art direction, make-up and CGI, are top notch. The many action sequences are indeed well choreographed and worth viewing (just not in 3-D). Still, the story rambles on endlessly as the director sets up his plots and myth-like exposition. Some judicious editing could have eliminated the ennui and helped to make the film even more effective. (And speaking of endless, the film leaves the moviegoers ultimately dissatisfied with its abrupt cliffhanging conclusion.)Yes, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an epic fantasy adventure film that has more to offer. There are now more engaging characters in place (excluding most of the dwarfs who still have no distinct personalities and are mere storytelling fixtures). There are also more liberties taken with Tolkien's original story, adding an unnecessary love interest between the handsome but height-challenged Kili (Aidan Turner) and a new character not found in the sacred novel, a female warrior elf named Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). There are more energized set pieces that build suspense well, although some of the film's overabundance of sub-plots undercut the continuity of the action, especially in the climatic showdown between Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smaug. The screenplay-by committee script by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro and Jackson is serviceable enough, but it lacks clever dialog and complex character development to make the film compelling and memorable. The story is a continuation of the first film with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) leading his gang of adventurers on on a perilous journey to reclaim their homeland from a fire-breathing menace named Smaug and make Thorin (Richard Armitage) its rightful king. All of the actors deliver their lines with a yeoman-like precision and, while they never garner genuine emotion, they do make their characters believable. Unlike Jackson's first disappointing chapter in this series which bored me completely, this sequel has a more serious tone and a darker edge to it. The silly slapstick antics of the merry dwarfs are thankfully gone and the film stays more focused on the journey and its dangers, although it takes forever to get to the main villain in the subtitle. In fact, we don't even see the evil dragon until close to the 90 minute mark, but Jackson has created an entertaining saga with fine production values and strong visual effects along the way. Nowhere is it more apparent than in three pivotal scenes: a creepy episode involving a giant spider attack that will easily bring nightmares to any child and adult in the audience; a harrowing escape by barrels down rapid waters while being sieged by those nasty Orcs, in which the fluidity of the camera-work and editing heighten the tension and show off the the cinematic skills of this talented director; and the film's highlight, a battle of wits between one little insignificant man, played ever so delightfully by Mr. Freeman, and one terrifying Goliath reptile, marvelously voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. (Smaug's scaly details and slithering movement are absolutely sensational.)While the action keeps coming, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a marvelously thrilling ride. It's the down time in-between that's a bit of a slough. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,3,9,14 December 2013
Toy Story 4," Toys R' Us
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A visually dazzling sequel whose animated heroes work overtime to save their film from a formulaic action-driven plot.JIM'S REVIEW: Toy Story 4 still follows its heart-warming, yet predictable, formula of lost toys and childhood innocence and the film wisely relies heavily on its well-established and beloved characters. Hail, hail the gang's all here, and then some, even if it seems a tad worn for wear.The screenplay by Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton successfully updates its story for this new generation of moviegoers. The story takes everyone cross country as little Bonnie enters kindergarten and begins to lose interest in her toy friends. However, this sequel spends too much time on the film's action-driven plot and non-stop chases. It's all road trip adventure and rescue missions, and not enough of an emotional build in its storytelling as in previous installments. The film introduces new characters that just do not register as effectively as Mr. Potato Head, Rex, or Bo Peep. Instead we encounter Duke Caboom, a small daredevil unsure of his own courage, Ducky and Bunny, two stuffed teddy bears lacking any heart, and a dumb spork named Forky in search of a brain. They're off, but not to see any wizard.Still, the technical aspects of this film are beautifully rendered with stunning use of stark shadows and bright lighting. Scenes are densely composed with such unbridled mastery. The background detailing is remarkable, especially the subtle discarded remains found inside a cluttered antique store. Very well directed by Josh Cooley, the film is a lovely visual treat. One simply forgets that we are watching animation at its zenith.Even though the story doesn't quite compare to other chapters, there are some truly wonderful sequences to enjoy: an opening credit scene that fluidly shows the changes through the years in everyone's lives, a chase sequence staged in the confines of a curio cabinet, a carnival barker unaware of a toy uprising, and my favorite, a macabre encounter with a creepy Gabby Gabby doll and her ventriloquist dummy henchmen stalking Woody in search of his valuable voice-box.And Tom Hanks does have a valuable voice-box as he perfectly inhabits his sensitive friend in me. His voice-over work as Woody is in a class by itself. Once again, Tim Allen brings to his character the needed swagger, bravado, and comic elements. Solid support is given by Annie Potts as a newly empowered Bo Peep, Wallace Shawn as a nervous dino, and Joan Cusack as Cowgirl Jessie. Breathing life into their new characters are Tony Hale, Keanu Reeve, Jordan Peele, Keegan-Michael Key, and especially, Christina Hendricks as the menacing yet vulnerable Lady in Pink.Toy Story 4 may not be the series' strongest entry, but the bar is still high compared to other animated films that usually go for cheap laughs and sophomoric humor. This highly engaging film has more to say about the human condition than most animated or, for that matter, live action movies nowadays. The artistry is there in full force, with much to admire, even if the film's narrative loses its way on its nostalgic journey in search of childhood memories and the value of friendship. Yes, this series still has a friend in me.",8,0,1,23 June 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," To A Fault
","This film is mildly recommended.No, the fault is in the story, a simple tale of two teenagers coping with The Big C. Based on the popular YA book, the film, as well as its source, is marketed for an adolescent audience, which is certainly not me. While the subject is adult and serious, the treatment is purely superficial and saccharine. Let's begin to count the ways this weepie manipulates its audience and is a disservice to any cancer survivor:￼1. The Stereotypical Young Lovers: As with all romantic films, the couple must be good- looking and adorable, but more so, the two doomed partners need to be brave and stoic as they buck the odds to keep their love alive. Here, for your approval are Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgot), two teenagers who meet cute at a cancer support group and fall head over heels in love. They suffer, as they must, but as one character ruefully points out,'Pain deserves to be felt.' Unfortunately, I felt the pain and suffered as does the audience as they spout positive bromides about survival and love rather than real teenage conversation.2. Dumb Plotting: Director Josh Boone helms the story fairly well, amid all the suds. The screenplay is based on John Green's popular novel and Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber rarely stray from the source material. Both set these lovers on a absurd journey to Amsterdam in order to meet a writer (well played by Willem Dafoe) whose book inspired them to move on with their lives. (This particular section of the film is where I gave up all hope for any sense of truth to enter the picture. Especially cloying is a scene in the Anne Frank house that defies any resemblance to reality.)￼3. Inconsistent Acting: The Fault in Our Stars does have one stellar performance at its core which slightly elevates the movie. Ms. Woodley is the perfect heroine to play Hazel, bringing nuance and a fine degree of distinction to her melodramatic role. She keeps the mellow at bay and is convincing in her dramatic turns. This talented actress invests in her character and so does the moviegoer. Not the same can be said about her co-star, Mr. Elgort, who brings his puppy dog eyes and handsomeness to the forefront. No subtlety here. It's a surface performance without much depth, a look-good-and-read-your-lines performance. This throws the whole love story out of kilter. (Strong support is also given by Laura Dern and Sam Trammell as Hazel's devoted parents, less than good support by Nat Wolff in the thankless role of as their wacky sick friend, Isaac.)4. Unrealistic Treatment of an Illness: The film is relentless in its shallow depiction of its disease, always looking at the sunny side of life and looking away from the harrowing effects of cancer. Dying is such an unpleasantness, a mild interruption of life in The Fault is in Our Stars. For every realistic display showing the effects of this debilitating illness, there are an infinite number of life-affirming uplifting moments that overplay the characters' circumstances. The couple's grim fates are always just out of reach, but rarely seen in the true context of death. Death is ugly, but not here. The film doesn't want to be too much of a downer after all.￼5. A Slow Death Indeed: In conclusion, romantic doom is profitable in films. Screen junkies love a good cry. Look at some past winners in this tear-jerking category: An Affair to Remember, Bridges of Madison County, Ghost, Titanic, The Notebook, Dr. Zhivago, and the granddaddy of all soapy romantic movies, Love Story. The rare few that merit our tears can even be exemplary movies, films that have been sensitively rendered: Gone With the Wind, Brokeback Mountain, Brief Encounter and the two films that always do me in, Casablanca, and Roman Holiday. Those films have the words and pictures and stars in perfect alignment. Just as many soap operas before this, The Fault in Our Stars tries hard but it doesn't earn every drop of moisture lodged in those tear ducts. It may get that whimpering reaction by its final scenes, but that's mostly due to the luminous Shailene Woodley. Well, I guess every generation needs a Love Story. But as for me...I'll always have Paris or Rome.

To Rome With Love," Little Italy
","This film is not recommended.In Woody Allen 44th movie, aptly titled To Rome with Love, four stories try to become one whole film, with sporadic success. The film lacks cohesion, with some light romantic tales intermixed with stories of pure slapstick and farce. Occasionally the writer / director hits his stride, but the laughs seem infrequent and the comic rhythms never merge. This is minor Allen, but at least, he gets to travel.During his prolific career as director / writer, Mr. Allen continues to try a hit-or-miss approach to his personal independent films. The filmmaker seems more concerned with the jokey punchlines and convoluted plot devices than creating any genuine depth or pathos with his characters and their circumstances. It's as if the director was at odds with the writer and neither would compromise their own point of view, sacrificing the final product.After his witty and highly entertaining Oscar-winning film, Midnight in Paris, the Woodsman sets sail to another European location to create cinematic situations that deal with fame, infidelity, young love, unbridled passion, past regrets, and any flaw that makes us human. This setting is Roma, where love and sex delight and confuse its inhabitants on a regular basis. The film is a dizzying mélange of the Eternal City, a giddy travelogue to this country and its most popular tourist destinations. It doesn't overstay its welcome, due to the fine ensemble cast, although, in one particular segment, it does come darn close. Still one enjoys the visit, but a return trip is highly unlikely. To Rome with Love tells its several tales of romantic entanglements and tribulations in four separate vignettes, all dealing with surreal flights of fancy, the illusion of love and the disillusion of relationships, and the inability to escape our unwanted desires. For that reason, I decided to grade each episode individually, resulting in a final average: Story 1: Jesse Eisenberg is Jack, a happily engaged young man who meets his fiancée's neurotic best friend, Monica ( Ellen Page ). Of course, the more time Jack invests with Monica, the more intrigued he becomes. Enters Alec Baldwin as John, an architect who may or may not be a figment of Jack's imagination. John may be is an older version of Jack, but he mainly serves the story as its narrative conscience, bantering witty asides, as he tries to avert this liaison with disastrous results.Comment: By far, the best of the lot, although Baldwin's character becomes an enigma throughout most of the film. This episode entertains with its clever plotting and funny conversations. Perhaps if this small slice of Little Italiana were expanded and the script slightly revamped, this vignette could have made a more interesting film on its own. GRADE: BStory 2 : A newlywed couple, Milly and Antonio ( Alessandro Tiberi and Allesandra Mastronardi ) are honeymooning in Rome. Both lovers are momentarily separated and later charmed and seduced by Millie's favorite actor ( a miscast Altonio Albanese ), and in Antonio's case, a prostitute with, ( what else? ) a heart of gold named Anna ( Penelope Cruz ). Complications ensue with disastrous results. Comment: Partly successful, this portion uses a convoluted plot structure to interweave its stories about the two separated lovers. Cruz and Tiberi have a nice chemistry and the dialog here is smart. Unfortunately, the story derails as it detours the characters into sit- com situations that have no real payoff. GRADE: B-Story 3: Woody Allen is Jerry, an opera director who is married to the sardonic Phyllis ( Judy Davis ). This husband and wife team have come to Italy to visit their daughter, Hayley ( Alison Pill ) who is about to marry a handsome Italian named Michelangelo ( Flavio Parenti ). While Jerry mulls over his soon-to-be son-in-law with the usual one-liners and deprecating humor that is Allen's trademark, he meets Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo ( Fabio Armiliato ) a common man, and overhears him singing in an uncommonly melodious voice. Jerry is completely enamored of this vocal gift and wants to arrange for an operatic debut. One small glitch: that voice only projects in the shower. Jerry tries to find a solution to this problem with disastrous results.Comment: A one joke premise that runs aground very quickly. Silly and inane, the characters never amount to anything remotely real and the premise is a bore. Only Judy Davis survives in this tedious story. GRADE: CStory 4 : Roberto Benigni plays Leopoldo, a comic ordinary everyman who suddenly finds fame and fortune. He tries to cope with the world of celebrity worship since he no longer has any private moments for himself. Oh the price of fame! Hounded by paparazzi and fans, Leopoldo longs for the simple life as he tries to elude all of its fancy trappings and temptations with disastrous results.Comment: Quite disappointing, easily the runt of the pack. Allen ponders the concept of fame and creates a surreal and sanctimonious look at celebrities and their pampered lifestyle, concluding, not surprisingly, that an idol's life is not that idyllic. Most of the slapstick and dialog falls flat in its heavy-handed predictability. GRADE: C-Photographed by Darius Khondji, the film has an ugly dingy yellowed tint to many of its scenes which does little to enhance this beautiful city's allure. The non-editing by Alisa Lepseiter is clunky and quite choppy. None of the scenes even try to flow with one another, creating an abrupt and jarring effect. Overall, To Rome with Love never gels as one solid film, either in its script or in its filmmaking.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: An Unexciting Journey
","This film is mildly recommended. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey suffers from a terrible case of the 'cutes'. So, to honor Peter Jackson's misguided approach to J.R.R. Tolkien's classic tale, this review will segue into the world of the pun and groaners due to the candy-coated handling of this slightly disappointing venture. In this prequel of immensely superior The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Martin Freeman stars as Bilbo Baggins, uncle of Frodo ( or Dildo Gaggings, if he ever needs a porn name ). Ian McKellan returns as the wizard, Gandalf, with a mission impossible for the young hero of our story to accept. Riches and treasures may be the reward although they are guarded by an evil dragon named Smaug ( and there just might be a magical ring too ). So Bilbo teams up with a baker's dozen of dwarfs ( as if seven or eight wasn't enough ). They set off to do battle and reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor, fighting orcs, giants, and other creatures along the way.Though not named for the most famous grouping of tiny people, excluding those ever lovin' Munchkins, these pint-size adventurers exhibit the same traits found in the land of Disney. It's a small world after all and an even smaller wonder that there is not a Sneezy or Happy found in the bunch, but Dopey and Grumpy could surely fit in this motley bunch. This merry band of men all lose their respective charm mid-entrance as silly slapstick ensues. Endearing they're not. Annoying they are. It's Middle-earth here, and middling is best way to describe the treatment of this film adaptation, especially in the film's slow first hour or so. The film takes an unexpected extended approach, making Tolkien's single novel into three separate installments for moviegoers to view in the upcoming years. Obviously Jackson and the studio honchos are hoping the Hobbit franchise will be Hobbit-forming. ( Well, I for one am not addicted to this series as yet. )This Hobbit hobbles along its merry way, happy to be gonzo in its extravagance with the latest state-of-the-art CGI and dopey in its breakthrough with fast-speed technology. Jackson wanted a sharper image to his film and produced it with a higher frame rate, ( 48 FPS vs. the customary 24 FPS ) which has gotten mixed results from those who have seen that version in a few selected theaters. I am not one of the lucky ( or unlucky ) moviegoer to experience that sensation as that version is only slated to play in specially equipped movie- houses, none of which are nearby. ) Still, if only Jackson paid more attention to script details, story-wise, the film could have pick up its own pace too. The overall tone of the film version resembles a live action cartoon rather than a thrilling fantasy adventure tale for grown-ups.However, there is much to recommended with the film's splendid production values and the technically proficient CGI that one comes to expect from the director and his talented film crew. Some encounters resonate well, like the set pieces in the goblins' lair and the sudden attack of the stone giants. The battle scenes are uniformly well staged and the fluid tracking shots help create some tension, mostly in the film's latter sequences. There is also a brilliant sequence toward the end of the film which brings Bilbo and his nemesis, the delightfully tormented and conflicted Gollum ( winning animated by Andy Serkis and the artisans ) into play. The give-and-take of these characters and their clever dialog of riddles energizes the film, bringing it momentarily to life. It is only that brief resuscitation that shows exactly what this film could have been if the filmmakers had the courage to embrace a more serious view of the story instead of its childlike safe and innocuous vision of the tale. The overly sensitive handling of the darker side of evil may bring more kiddies to the till, but at what price glory?There's just too much sunshine and lollipops in this film's version for this moviegoer. I sat there a-waiting the sparkling rainbows and pretty unicorns to come dancing into view. This film experience delivered an unexpected point of view from Jackson and company, one that I did not envisioned from Tolkien's book. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey should have been drastically cut down to size, rewritten, and renamed The Hobbit: An Unending Journey. Pompous it is. Precious it ain't.

Non-Stop," It's Gonna Be a Bumpy Flight
","This film is not recommended.Oh, that dreaded third act! It destroys many great works of art, be they books, plays, or movies. While Non Stop is no great work of art in anyone's mind, the curse stays with this nifty little mystery thriller. The musty old premise of this whodunit can go back to the superior puzzler, Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians: People are being systematically murdered, in this case, aboard a plane, and it is up to our hero to find the culprit and end this crime wave.Liam Neesom again is typecast in this action role as an alcoholic lawman who is forced to solve this mystery. (At least, he brings some authority and gratis to his role as the air marshal aboard the plane.) But as the story evolves, so do the loopholes in the plot. The film sets up its red herrings as interesting suspects, but becomes more ludicrous and illogical until it finally disregards the mystery and resembles a pure action film with its far-fetched conclusion. The execution of the murders are strictly preposterous and it is never fully explained how the killer had the know-how and ability to act out this scheme.Talented actors are wasted in this standard story: Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery, Corey Stoll, Lupita Nyong'o, and Linus Roache. That is the real crime afoot. That three people contributed to this screenplay (John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach, and Ryan Engle) is an even greater mystery. Direction by Jaume Collet-Serra is merely adequate, although he does keep the action moving. The special effects are routine but acceptable. The film was moderately entertaining and kept me guessing until its disappointing revelations unraveled with its dumb ending.Non-Stop left me non-plussed.

How to Train Your Dragon 2," Dragon Master
","This film is highly recommended.Se-quel-i-tis: The unnecessary remaking of a tale once told, based on a previous original idea using familiar characters, plot, and setting in order to profit from the prior knowledge and admiration of an unsuspecting viewing audience; this becomes a popular practice whenever the creative force is bereft of any new thoughts or practices with the sole purpose of exploiting the masses in search of its own identity.Nowadays, so many books and films suffer from this malady. Commonplace in today's world, this safe haven is the ideal format for writers and filmmakers who may be hatching a moneymaking scheme at the cost of their own integrity. The results usually become a disappointing venture that is a par below their first imaginative offering.￼My apprehension for returning to the 'new-old' has been regularly tested, especially with recent past experiences the likes of The Amazing Spiderman 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Mr. Peabody and Sherman. That said, How to Train Your Dragon 2 may be the cure. This animated film is a new breed of sequel: an uplifting and marvelous blending of wonderful visual images with a clever and insightful story about courage and family ties. HTTYD2 is one of the best films of the year, totally satisfying and absolutely enthralling.￼Somehow avoiding all the similar traps and formula that befall other second helpings, HTTYD2 is a giddy joyride, an unabashed delight for the entire family. Kudos go to Dean DeBlois who has written a literate screenplay that avoids sophomoric humor and dated pop references and also for his yeoman-like direction. Fine voice-over work from Cate Blanchett, Gerald Butler, America Ferrera, Djimon Housou, and Kristen Wiig complete this delightful filmgoing experience, with special mention to Jay Baruchel, vocally perfect in capturing the teenage tone and awkwardness of the film's hero, Hiccup. The film does occasionally slip into conventional sequel territory and its villain is a tad one-dimensional, but those minor infractions are few.￼The story takes play five years after the first film, in a land of Berk where humans and dragons peacefully co-mingle. Hiccup is now a gawky teenager full of self doubt and recklessness, ready for adventure but not ready to take over the throne of his father's Viking kingdom. Trouble looms just outside its gates in the form of an evil dragon tamer named Drago. Hiccup, along with his trusty and loyal reptilian sidekick, Toothless, decide to make peace, not war, by trying to plead their case to this marauder and his winged fire-breathing army. Of course, that decision leads to more conflict than expected.￼HTTYD2 remains a thrilling adventure, a visceral treat for old and young alike. The mind- blowing aerial sequences are energized with enough panoramic vistas, wide angle perspectives, and fluid camera-work that one is simply amazed at its artistry. The photo realistic details are stunning achievements in state-of-the-arts animation. Colors literally pop and the background settings are massive in scope. Textures (ice, water, fire, fur, scales, etc) are exacting and precise. Characters are nicely rendered and their natural movements subtly enhanced. The dragons come in all sorts and sizes with unique features and they themselves all have that cute as a puppy persona which helps to instantly connect with viewers.￼This is masterful animation in every frame. No sloppy seconds, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is that rare children's film that has more to say than 'Gimme your money.' It is a exhilarating film experience that captivates its audience and begs for another viewing. If more sequels had this much imagination and artistic inventiveness, all I can say is, 'Gimme more new-old!'

The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Dollop of Whimsy and Fun
","My expectations were high after hearing the heaps of praise lavished on Wes Anderson's latest absurd comedy, The Grand Hotel Budapest. Critics adored this small gem of a film. While I was neither overwhelmed or underwhelmed by this well-made film, I greatly admired it, especially in its grandiose style and artistry on every technical level, but I never truly connected with all of the characters or their situations emotionally. Let's just say I was whelmed.Like his other films (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Moonrise Kingdom), there remains the director's idiosyncratic calling cards: Characters never walk or stroll, they gallop or scurry haphazardly about. Plots are hatched and become more convoluted than needed. Violence erupts unexpectedly. Title cards organize the action. Vibrant colors and quick hints of irony are in full view. Yes, there is always that certain whimsy and boldness to Anderson's cast of characters (and his recurring repertoire of actors) and his meticulous attention to detail in its setting. However, this time, his film carries with it a more serious undertone which tends to repeatedly undercut the farcical elements of the tale. There is much wild abandon and dollops of insightful and witty dialog, but this time around, The Grand Hotel Budapest never pushes itself beyond all-out farce mode. The overall effect seems a tad labored.The film is told in flashbacks, a story within a story within a story, like an elaborate Russian Matryoshka nesting doll. The film begins with a student is reading a book in a cemetery that leads to its author (Tom Wilkinson) reminiscing about the glory and heydays of the impeccable Grand Hotel Budapest, which leads to a young writer (Jude Law) meeting a former Lobby Boy named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham in the later sequence and Tony Revolori in the earlier ones) who reminiscing about its clientèle and his mentor, the hotel's chief concierge known as Gustave H. (a winning Ralph FIennes), a fastidious and proper dandy who beds the elderly ladies who stay there. Tilda Swinton (unrecognizable in superb hair and make-up) plays one of his conquests, Madame D., who bequeaths an expensive painting to her lover, causing a chain of events that becomes the main storyline in this tale of murder and mayhem. It's all cleverly constructed, perhaps too lovingly layered by Anderson, but it is precisely the film's structure that becomes a plot device which slows the film's comic momentum whenever it leaves the silly hi-jinks of M. Gustave H. and Company.But, dear moviegoers, The Grand Hotel Budapest has so many virtues to warrant your viewing. Starting with Anderson's solid direction and wonderful vision, the film boasts excellence on every technical and artistic level: great acting and cameos by many fine actors, memorable costumes by Milena Canonero surrounded by opulent production design by Adam Stockhausen, and Alexandre Desplat's lyrical East European inspired score. Kudos also go to the stunning photography by Robert D. Yeoman and expert editing by Barney Pilling. This film is sure to garner many awards this upcoming movie season.The Grand Hotel Budapest is a well-intentioned and well-crafted film by a talented director and his creative team. It is a diverting trifle, deliciously entertaining, delightfully nutty, and yet bittersweet, like a confectionist treat from Mendl's. Too bad it's not all that filling.

The Favourite," A Trio of Great Performances Overcome the Flaws
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A good, not great, period drama due to the director's excessive style.JIM'S REVIEW: I must admit that filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos has never been one of my favorite directors. While his films have a visually acuity that is distinctively his own, they lack strong storytelling. His initial premise is always intriguing, but his over-intellectualizing, convoluted plotting, and third act ambiguous endings never satisfy. (The Lobster (2016) told a story of two people forced to find love in a dystopian sci-fi world or they would shape-shift into an animal. The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) is a film where a father must decide which of his family members he must kill in order to save the others from otherworldly forces.) His trademark use of off-kilter camera angles, music scores that resemble sound installations, and remote characters caught in dire situations are all present in his latest endeavor too. The Favourite is another example that less would have been more.Yet, this film has become a critical darling and is garnering many accolades. (Even this reviewer's expectations were high, though inaccurate due to a movie trailer that stressed the farcical aspects of the film and portrayed the movie as a comedy...It is not.) But it is an improvement on the director's resume of arty films and at least he is going in a more positive direction by reining in some (not all) of his excessive touches. (Actually, the film would have been quite successful had it been directed as a farce allowing it to be humorous in spirit and cattier in tone. That would have been a far more entertaining moviegoing experience.)The story goes like this: Lady Abigail (Emma Stone, very good in the role) wants her place in aristocracy. New to the royal court, she is a cunning ambitious wannabe who craves fame, fortune, and, most importantly, power. Her arch rival is a woman just as cruel and demanding, her cousin, Lady Sarah Churchill (a winning Rachel Weisz) who is firmly entrenched in all the decision-making in the House of Stuart. These ladies-in-waitings scheme and battle to gain control of the court. They rely on the manipulation and oneupmanship of a very unstable Queen Anne (a magnificent Olivia Colman), whose physical health and mental issues cloud her judgement.While the film is flawed, it does have a trio of wonderful performances which enhance the film greatly. The political and sexual intrigue may be the crux of the film but it is these actresses that punch up the drama. They create memorable characters as they deliver their lines with verve and delicious venom. Particularly moving is Ms. Colman who takes this mad queen into areas of unexpected pathos and vulnerability, from a screaming harpy to a tragic solitary figure with all of her mercurial mood swings.The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara has pithy one-liners and depicts a court on the brink of disarray and corruption. Although I was always involved by the plot and its rich characters, the film allows the intricate hierarchy of the palace household and their quirky and strange behaviors to unfold, albeit too slow-paced for my taste.Mr. Lanthimos stages his drawing-room set pieces with much skill, filling the screen with gorgeous costuming from Sandy Powell and a stunning production design achieved by Fiona Crombie. Still the director relies on too much theatrics with the overuse of anachronistic fisheye photography and an annoying modern-sounding score with snippets of loud classical music that interferes with all the sumptuous period atmosphere. These overindulgences become a major misstep in a film that held great promise...and again, there is that third act denouncement faux pas once more that undercuts the storytelling.The Favourite plays like a comedy of ill manners without much comedy. Yet it is technically accomplished filmmaking with much to admire. It also boasts some of the best acting this year. Yet with all of this talent, the film is still in search of a story better told.",8,16,40,17 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Should You Decide to Accept...
","This film is recommended.Brad Bird ( The Incredibles, Ratatouille ) was the perfect choice to rejuvenate this languishing series. With his skills in animation and his visual panache, he expertly directs the film as if it is a live action cartoon, using his actors as props to his lavish backdrops. Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol, ( a terrible title, I might add ), is the best installment of the series, which is faint praise for a series that has been lackluster and absurd in its previous re-enactments. Is four the charm? Yes. Does it entertain? Absolutely? Does it make sense? Absolutely not.This movie franchise is merely one hair-raising stunt after the next hair-raising stunt with very little plot or logic in between the chases, disguises, and gadgetry that hide the gaping holes in the story. In MI4, Ethan Hunt ( Tom Cruise, looking fit and a bit older ) is back with a new team of agents on call ( Jeremy Renner as Brandt, Simon Pegg as Benji, and Paula Patton as Jane Carter ). All are undercover and underwritten as before, and again, the action is fast- paced and the exotic settings slightly more interesting this time around. It's still patently formulaic: The mission is planned to the nth detail, something goes wrong with the plan, quick thinking and agile maneuvering saves the day. In MI4, the team has decided to accept the mission to track down a terrorist named Hendricks ( Michael Nyqvist ). Only this time, they are disavowed due to an initial failed attempt to stop this madman in Russia, thus giving them the Ghost Protocol status. The IMF team goes on an endless search for justice and to reinstate their standing in the espionage market. This leads our determined and unstoppable agents to Dubai, Mumbai, and other global cities to bring down Hendricks at all costs.Bird keeps the scenes moving quickly from one highly-charged moment to the next. The film's rapid-fire action sequences are skillfully choreographed and thoroughly suspenseful. Yet this time, they bristle with more intensity and sly humor than any of the other movie installments. The major set piece of the film takes place outside the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as Hunt plays Spiderman and climbs the tall exteriors with special gloves that allow him to stick to the windows. That is until...well, that's part of the formula, remember? ( By the way, this specific film sequence is classic and will long be regarded as one of the most breathtaking moments in modern filmmaking. The stunt-work, photography, editing, and use of CGI are remarkable in their staging and execution. ) There are also other spectacular action sequences involving a blinding sandstorm chase and another exciting section at a multi-level parking garage that moves swiftly on many levels.The new cast has a wonderful chemistry and their individual quirks add to the tension and thrilling results. Also on hand in a small but humorous role is Anil Kapoor as Brij Nath, a rich and pampered playboy who is another target in the team's strategy of foiling the villain. As always, the Mission Impossible intricate plotting continues to defy common sense and ask its audience to blindly believe in their schemes and goals. So much of the story depends on Hunt's plan to go a certain rational way, never taking into account human foibles and random coincidences. This template becomes troubling and absurd as it always makes the IMF team's best laid plans go astray, making the moviegoer question their professional killer instincts. The real aim of this film series and Mr. Cruise and Co. is: Reality, be damned! Let the good times roll! Come on and take a wild ride with us! Enjoy the adrenaline rush! Any moviegoer is expected to set aside their disbelief in order to enjoy the film even more.So, with all that said, Mission Impossible 4 is really Mission Improbable. This is a crowd- pleasing action-packed thriller with strong production values and some of the most extreme stunts ever filmed. Your enjoyment level will vary depending on your acceptance, or lack thereof, with its ludicrous plotting and preposterous logic. Of course, it's not Shakespeare, you knew that going in, but then Shakespeare never hung 130 stories above the ground either like Tommy Boy.

Foxcatcher," This Sporting Life
","This film is recommended.John Eleuthère du Pont, heir to the du Pont fortune and avid sports fan. Mark Schultz, Olympic wrestling champion. Dave Schultz, brother of Mark, friend of John, and another Olympic winner. This trio comes together, setting their sights on a common goal in Bennett Miller's compelling fact-based drama, Foxcatcher.Steve Carell plays the obsessive du Pont, a wealthy entrepreneur who loves to collect things: stamps, stuffed animals, firearms, money, and athletes. He starts a wrestling school called Foxcatcher Farm with his loftiest goal to reach that Olympic gold. But there is no glory in this tragic story, as he begins to nurture the young ambitious Mark, under the tutelage and help of his devoted older brother and develops a strange hold on both siblings.Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futtleman, Foxcatcher tells its story of corruption, power, wealth, and control with a minimum of dramatic flourish. Their screenplay documents this stranger-than-fiction true story, but the slow pacing of the film tends to distill the impact of the circumstances. The three main characters are well-written but other supporting roles seem sketchy and not as strongly developed. The time line of events seems blurred also, especially the physical transformation of Mark Schultz who gains and loses poundage in mega-minutes.However, Foxcatcher does have, in its corner, superb performances. Channing Tatum delivers the best work as the beleaguered wrestler, unsure of his talent and overly-eager to please. Mark Ruffalo grounds his character and shows a loving brother and competitive coach simultaneously with such subtlety and conviction. Vanessa Redgrave, Sienna Miller, and Anthony Michael Hall give solid support in their underwritten roles. But earning the gold for this film is Carell as the schizophrenic philanthropist. The actor sheds his comic talent and delves into the psychotic world of du Pont with a fury of emotions that will startle and deeply sadden any moviegoer. He plays this complicated character as an outsider, a short stocky oddity, out-of-touch with reality and consumed with escalating rage. This is certainly a banner year for actors and their physical transformation and Carell's portrayal is one of this year's finest. Foxcatcher is well directed by Miller who seems to have a special fascination with eccentric characters, as shown in his two previous films (Capote, Moneyball). He shrewdly establishes the characters and their relationships almost immediately but rarely lets the actual suspense build. One wonders (and never fully comprehends) the bizarre behavior on the screen and the illogical actions of these characters without any immediate consequences early on, questioning why the warning signals were so readily overlooked to prevent this outcome. Never the screenplay, characters, or direction clearly answer that issue.One may know the outcome of the film well before viewing. But Foxcatcher deals with its violence unflinchingly and tackles the issue of mental health in a no-holds-barred way. Foxcatcher carries with it a ring of truth about the madness of sports, competition, and raw ambition, and while it may not fully deliver on its initial promise to captivate and impress its audience, it does have three stunning bits of acting that are top contenders this year. That alone makes the film worth viewing. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,7,13,24 December 2014
It Follows," Misled
","(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: An admirable attempt at rebooting the horror genre that gets lost in translation.GRADE: C+Teenagers + Sex = Death. The Unholy Three make a deadly combination whenever horror films are concerned. Pay heed: Have sex and you will become the next victim! Freddy, Michael, or Leatherface will absolve you from sin with a quick slice-and dice maneuver. It's the movie code. The latest supernatural fright-fest, It Follows, takes that common premise for a little spin. Oh, sex is still on the menu, but now, it can possibly save your life, making a no- win situation into a win-win. Let me explain without giving too much away.￼Maika Monroe plays Jay, the teen in peril as an invisible force is set to kill her off. She has been cursed via a sexual transmitted encounter with her boyfriend. Now, a shape-shifting apparition will follow her to her death unless she can find another sexual partner to infect ASAP to stop this chain reaction. It is this dilemma that becomes the basis for the film and its minimal scares.David Robert Mitchell shows promise. He is more skilled as a director than screenwriter. He gives his low budget film some nice highs with his strong imagery and adds moody suspenseful sequences that owe a great deal to John Carpenter and Wes Craven. Complete with an effective synthesized score to ratchet up the tension, the film has an eerie nightmarish atmosphere. Mitchell wisely downplays the monster, leaving much to the viewer's imagination. However, he still goes for too many cheap scare tactics with abrupt sound effects that go bump in the night.￼It Follows doesn't quite follow the formula we moviegoers have come to expect. Which is good. However, what is bad is that the movie loses its focus midway in a script that is in need of some major rewrites, especially when logic is constantly lost along the way. There are too many dumb actions from our heroine and his friends, plus odd anachronistic items that make one wonder about the era and time-frame of the film when one should be more engrossed in the story. (Is it the 60's, 70's, or 80's?) Some leaps of logic occur in the flawed screenplay: Must teenagers always run to a deserted location in the middle of the night when being hunted? Are there any police or adults around to help? Has no one notice some strange deaths that are happening in the community?￼While there is much to admire in the film's execution, the overall effect plus an unsatisfying ending only make It Follows just another victim in the horror genre.

Avengers: Infinity War," If It's Action You Want
","GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A superhero movie with a puny and weak plot and non-stop action.JIM'S REVIEW: Superheroes. They come in all shapes and sizes, with varying super powers and enough attitude and skill to fight against evil and protect mankind. More importantly, they rake in millions at the box office. The DC Comics and Marvel universe have taken over the movie business and offer critic-proof blockbuster after blockbuster for the insatiable moviegoing public.But perhaps my favorite crusader comes from neither source. He's a little big man by the name of Buzz Lightyear whose famous catch phrase and mantra was...'To infinity and beyond'. That classic line may be over two decades old, but this toy oracle saw the future of cinema back in the mid-nineties. Which leads us to the 18th film from the Marvel Studios series, Avengers: Infinity War, the latest pop entertainment from one of the most successful and profitable franchise in cinema history. In this installment, we discover that there has been a rift among superheroes. There is Team Ironman and his loyal crew of major and minor characters (Thor, Spiderman, The Hulk, Doctor Strange) versus Team Captain America and his colorful line-up of rogue groupies (Black Widow, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, White Wolf, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Falcon), plus the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Lots and lots of superheroes with little time to spare for deeper character development but lots of time for CGI and action stunts. Yet what will unite them all?Why, of course, a truly bad villain, namely Thanos, who wants all six of the magical infinity stones in his possession in order to dominate the world! (Maybe, collecting trading cards of all of the assembled superheroes might have been a more challenging goal for our conflicted outlaw.) Yes, the plot is puny and weak, but the consequences to stop this megalomaniac are of the life and death variety. So all you need to know is that the battle lines have been drawn over the prized McGuffin, with one battle scene leading to the next for maximum enjoyment. ACTION is in not in short supply, even if logic and high drama take a backseat to the frequent combat sequences. Anthony and Joe Russo ably direct and keep the pace at warp speed lest they disappoint their youthful target audience. A screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely juggles the misadventures on the different planetary destinations with varied results, some are simply more interesting than others. To its credit, it establishes many likable quirky characters and their camaraderie is infectious due to the actors' personal stamps on their recognizable roles. Yet the movie has a hard time spreading its narrative with a balance of equal screen time and does little to advance the development of some central characters and their interrelationships. Too often the numerous sub-plots and mini-expeditions with such a large ensemble wears thin. Dialog has some clever humorous retorts but rarely aspires to any real poignancy or gravitas. The gangs all here, with an all-star ensemble that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Bossman, and in lesser roles: Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Benicio del Toro, and others too numerous to name. Josh Brolin effectively plays the evil Thanos and creates a strong adversary who allows power to corrupt his soul.The CGI is impressive throughout. Less effective is the editing and handling of transitions. At times, the well staged combat scenes intercut some of the action. Too much planet hopping interrupts the overall flow and gives the film an episodic vibe...the sum of the parts never making a very cohesive whole. Yes, there is much to hold one spellbound with its big budget cast of thousands approach and the film's fine production values, but all the rigmarole and commotion almost exhausts the moviegoer rather than enthralls.One eagerly awaits for the fractured teams of heroes to meld into an unstoppable force, but it never truly materializes and the cliffhanger ending is far from satisfying. This long and epic film literally comes to a stop with no clear denouncement, taking Mr. Lightyear's phrase and deciding not to settle anything soon, just looking beyond...to the next installment, with no end in sight.In Avengers: Infinity War, the war rages on and on...and the Marvel franchise lives long and prospers...to infinity.",8,1,7,2 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Fractured Fairy Tale - Tarantino Style
","GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Yes, the 60's were a wild time, but not as out of control as Quentin Tarantino's latest effort. It's his unfocused screenplay that undermines his movie.JIM'S REVIEW: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a very fractured fairy tale of late 60's LA. The film is 80% period atmosphere, 10% pop music, 8% star gazing, and 2% story, plot, and character development. Director / Writer Quentin Tarantino sets up an intriguing scenario and serves up his happily-ever-after revisionist ending once again (which seems to be an annoying reoccurring theme with this filmmaker of late). This time, the results are disappointing.Mr.Tarantino continually hones his craft as he repeatedly knows how to stage and build his scenes artistically, but that skill does not hide the empty and banal script. He seems more interested in cruising the streets with the radio blasting oldie hits or celebrating the golden age of Tinseltown with insider knowledge of filmdom than developing an intricate or interesting storyline.Far too much screen time is spent on period details, from movie marquees extolling B movies, nostalgic action TV shows, the western genre, and mod outfits than fleshing out his central characters and their relationships. The movie meanders from one set pieces to the next and builds pretension rather than tension. The screenplay takes nearly an hour to finally get to its basic plot and takes even more detours than necessary on its long and winding road to glory and gory.Fortunately, Mr. Tarantino has two star actors in his buddy film and they do some heavy lifting to add more bravado to their machismo stock roles. Leonardo DICaprio plays Rick Dalton, an down-on-his-luck alcoholic actor hoping to revive his failing career. Brad Pitt is Rick's loyal sidekick and best bud, Cliff Booth, his longtime stunt double who now serves as his gofer and number one fan. Their lives intertwine as do the events of Rick's neighbors: Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate, Charles Manson and his hippie clan. The two legendary actors use their already established screen personas to maximum advantage and they are very good, deserving of better material.The stargazing continues with the film's large ensemble. A perfectly cast Margot Robbie exemplifies the late Sharon Tate, but her role is underwritten. It's a shame that this throwaway role was downplayed and given minor status. The actress could have made a lasting impression with more screen time. Al Pacino is fun to watch as a slick Hollywood producer as is the reliable Bruce Dern. Providing solid support are Margaret Qualley and Dakota Fanning as two of Manson's followers, Timothy Olyphant as real-life actor, James Stacy, and a memorable turn by child actress, Julia Butters. Kurt Russell turns up as does Emile Hirsch and Luke Perry (his last film role) in what amounts to mere cameos. Mike Mohl as Bruce Lee is slightly amusing in his politically incorrect interpretation of Bruce Lee, but a miscast Damien Lewis fumbles as Steve McQueen for a mercilessly short time.Despite its many flaws,Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is a well crafted movie with top notch production values. Wonderful cinematography by Robert Richardson, detailed set design by Barbara Ling and Nancy Haigh, and Arianne Phillips' period costumes celebrate the era with sly assurance, even if the movie ultimately fails due to Mr. Tarantino's unfocused script (and Fred Raskins' editing which needs more judicious cutting). The director's virtuoso excesses are still there for his fanbase, but his usual clever dialog is absent for the most part. This is one of Mr. Tarantino's weakest efforts to date.But expect the unexpected...if that is sufficient enough. This is a Tarantino film after all, even if he sadly drifts into 'what if' territory. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood should have much to say, but the words and overwrought multiple stories get in the way. Major rewrites were needed and went unheeded. It is another case of a Hollywood screenwriter letting down a Hollywood director (and the moviegoing audience). Too bad it is one and the same person. Very fractured indeed.NOTE: A very funny post credits sequence is the best part of the film. Stay to see the tongue-firmly-in cheek Red Apple Cigarette commercial. It is a hoot!",5,10,22,28 July 2019
Beasts of No Nation," African Violence
","(Rating: ☆☆☆½ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: Violent and brutal, the film exposes a difficult subject that needs to be addressed.GRADE: B+Agu is a survivor. His family torn apart due to political unrest in his war-torn African village, he is caught up in a violent civil war and later recruited into a warlord's army in Cary Fukunaga's brutal and riveting film, Beasts of No Nation.￼We moviegoers are thrown into this chaos almost immediately. We see the before and after of the casualties of war: a once innocent young boy and the product of a loving family slowly weaned into a role of a violent child soldier. This chilling transformation is shown in the graphic details: his brutal initiation into the tribal army, his sadistic training sessions, his first killing, tensely staged in one of the bloodiest sequence in years. This is a unsettling film, not for the squeamish. (Be forewarned: Although the violence is never gratuitous, it is still a non- stop assault on your senses. I couldn't help but think if showing less would have had a more effective impact.) ￼Agu watches as the war escalates around him and he tries to comprehend its insanity. Psychologically indoctrinated into these acts of butchery by a crazed rebel leader, the Agu essentially loses his childhood innocence. It is a heart-wrenching series of events we witness and the film depicts these atrocities upfront and personal.Expertly written and directed by the talented Mr. Fukunaga (who also was the chief cinematographer as well), Beasts of No Nation is well-made but literally ultra-realistic in its execution. His vision is consistently strong and the director effectively shows the ravages of war with numerous in-your-face close-ups. The film's earlier images of children playing with a discarded television set or sibling rivalry between brothers sharply contrasts with the many scenes of senseless carnage. Sometimes the film overloads on the combat and killings and overstates its case. Many of these scenes become derivative and are, at times, unwatchable due to their graphic nature. ￼The acting between the two leads is exceptional. Idris Elba is excellent as the remorseless mercenary commandant, although one wishes there would be more character development into the makings of this monster. His interaction with first-time actor, Abraham Attah as Agu are so intense and believable. Attah, in his film debut, is outstanding in his sympathetic portrayal of the boy soldier. It is one of the most compelling and natural examples of acting ever given by a non-professional child actor.Shocking and powerful, Beasts of No Nation deserves to be seen. The subject may be disturbing, but it shows the evil that continues to fester in another part of the world. Serious moviegoers and Netflex subscribers, pay heed.￼Note: Premiering in movie theaters the same day as it was streamed to subscribers, Beasts of No Nation was produced and released by Netflix as their first project. This excellent film has been ceremoniously dumped and boycotted by major theatrical chains fearing this competitive practice to be the future of filmmaking. Movie theaters sabotaged any success the film may have had and, as punishment, the film never received any distribution, being sorely ignored. A sad state of affairs.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9,2,5,5 November 2015
Gone Girl," Gone, but Not Forgotten
","This film is highly recommended.Did he or didn't he? That is the question. The majority of the world's population already know that answer as they have already read Gillian Flynn's best-seller, Gone Girl. I, on the other hand, fall into a small minority and can see David Fincher's screen adaptation of this popular mystery novel with no preconceived notions or bias. So you may ask, was I able to solve the crime? Were the twists and convoluted plot satisfying? Did I like the film? My response to that is...Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is the primary suspect in his wife Amy's (Rosamund Pike) disappearance. Both appear to be the Great American Couple: beautiful, wealthy, happy, and in love. But those facades chip away to show a more troubling relationship, one filled with lies, secrets, and torment.Gone Girl is cleverly structured so that we view the mystery from two opposing points of view. Using the Rashoman effect, we follow Nick's narrative as its contrasts Amy's viewpoint via her diary. One never knows the actual truth as more complications arise in the investigation. Fincher's focuses on the media circus as it bellows out of proportion and paints Nick as the main culprit. His take on sensationalism in our society and our abject need for unethical journalism is akin to other great films on that same subject (Billy Wider's Ace in the Hole, Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express, Sydney Pollack's Absence of Malice, and Sidney Lumet's Network). More than just a murder mystery, the film debates larger issues such as the propagandizing of 24/7 network news coverage, our corrupt legal system, the absurd world of celebrity gossip, the perceived notion of puritanical family values, and the dysfunction of marriage itself. That's a lot to cover, plus adding the personal mystery to the mix, and his direction is so effortlessly and efficiently in control. This is a terrific film on so many levels and much credit must go to this director who manages to create a modern classic crime thriller. Also impressive is the screenplay by the original author, Ms. Flynn. Terse and focused, it defines its characters beautifully and deliberately confuses the moviegoer with its intricate plotting while still making logical sense, a rare feat these days. Whenever one's interest begins to flag, and it isn't often, a sudden plot twist arises or the film backtracks its focus on Nick or Amy's dueling contradictory versions of the crime scene. This is skillful filmmaking, both in the film's visual look and its complex plot structure. At times, some of the characters do seem like plot devices that are there with the sole purpose of moving along the action. But the film is so well acted that one doesn't really mind the artful manipulation involved in the storytelling.The acting is absolute perfection. Affleck continues to excel as an actor. He uses his rugged good looks and charming persona to his advantage in this role and can play the vulnerable or wicked card at a moment's notice too. It's a nuanced and totally believable portrait of a man whose guilt or innocence is in question. Ms. Pike is also in full control as the put-upon spouse or the scheming harpy, depending on the version that is on display. Solid support comes from a marvelous ensemble with a particular shout-out to Carrie Coons as Nick's loyal twin sister, Neil Patrick Harris as an odd loner and stalker type, Kim Dickens as the stalwart detective, and Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, Nick's unscrupulous lawyer. Also, production values are top notch throughout, especially the masterful editing by Kirk Baxter and an atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that builds tension beautifully. Everything is in the right place and nothing is missing in Gone Girl. It is one of this year's best films.

Django Unchained," Drag On, Django!
","This film is not recommended.The D is silent in Quentino Tarantino's blood-soaked film, Django Unchained, and so will you be, sitting there in the movie theater watching endless scenes of carnage and slaughter that co-mingles with the blaxploitation genre in this revisionist Western tale of revenge.  At the core of all this bloodshed and violence are the historic issues of slavery and racism, but Tarantino uses a spaghetti western format to hone in on his underlying message. Racial stereotypes, offensive white characters, and ethnic slurs abound. But so does action and dark humor, minus the wit, in this brutal parody of the Old West.Django Unchained is essentially a tale of vengeance and black empowerment, told by the talented Tarantino. But with all his Black Like Me posturing,  the director takes over the role of the angry white man speaking for the entire African-American race. It all seems a bit ludicrous and egotistical to lessen the horror of racism as a vehicle for pop entertainment. That said, Django Unchained is an extremely well-made film worthy of the attention from the more seriously-minded faction of adult film-goers, but its outlandish plot and excessive treatment of violence kept the movie too absurd for me to truly appreciate. ( I may come off as self-righteous but I do tend to over-react and worry when the abhorrent subject of slavery parades itself as pop entertainment for a younger generation, muddying the historical content to become a pale substitute for their only possible history lesson on that issue.  Fiction can so willingly become fact these days. I also question the R-rating slapped onto this blood-fest when a NC-17 rating is more befitting, with all the endless shootings, stabbings, and bludgeoning going on under the guise of vigilante justice in this film. ) After an hour's worth of slow-moving episodic detours and sub-plots involving repetitive shoot-em-ups, the film finally settles down to its main storyline, which is at least compelling:  A slave, Django ( Jamie Foxx ), searches for his wife, Broomhilda ( Kerry Washington ) who is now the property of an wealthy plantation owner, Calvin Candies ( Leonardo DiCaprio ). On his journey for salvation, Django befriends a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz ( Christoph Waltz ), and both continue on their rescue mission to Candyland ( the plantation's ironic name ). Now Tarantino has used this same set-up before in his previous films, a series of misadventures until the final climactic shoot-out takes place. It's his calling card. His solid filmmaking techniques and edgy style stays evident throughout his lengthy film. So does his gift for well-written conversations and flamboyant characters.  But his screenplay needs more reworking to streamlining his film's potent message and there is in dire need of eliminating unnecessary complications within its plot structure.Beside his ever-present trademark non-stop gratuitous violence, Tarantino's anachronistic blending of pop, hip-hop and rap songs, along with modern sounding jargon, sharply contrasts the visual images on display with mixed results. He overdoes the pop culture references this time around. The excessive use of the N-word ( estimated usage: nearly 100 times, without exaggeration ) seems to be here more for its shock value purposes that authenticity and richness in dialog.Where the director / writer achieves success is in his wisely assembled ensemble of actors for their overly ripe roles.  Waltz brings to his role a commanding presence and larger-than-life bravado. Washington creates a gripping portrait of a woman caught in a desperate struggle for freedom.  Also on hand in a small supporting role is a Tarantino favorite, Samuel L. Jackson, giving another ballsy performance as a morally corrupt man servant.  However, it is the film's evil villain that makes Django Unchained break free of its caricatural qualities. As Calvin Candies ( a.k.a. Simon LaGree channeling Snidely Whiplash ), DiCaprio is a guilty pleasure. The actor puts his underused comic talents to good service and astutely navigates a difficult role to great acclaim, creating such an indelible reprehensible scoundrel.  Yet, what throws the film slightly off-balance is Foxx in the title role.  The actor looks the part, but, strangely, seems too reserved and solemn for this empowered hero. Foxx does little to circumvent the subtle demands of this complex character.  He becomes a stock character, The Man with No Game.The film rambles on, with too many side stories that do little to advance the action. More judicious editing is needed which would also help pick up the film's lackadaisical pacing. As the case with most Tarantino films, scenes go on far too long to build tension that has already been established.  Humor seems sparse or sophomoric as set pieces drone on with no real purpose.Django Unchained is a live-action cartoon with an adult perceptiveness. Tarantino's films always have a divisive effect and this latest venture is no different. His re-boot of the Western for today's movie-going audiences will thrill only his die-hard fans and alienate others. Yes, dear moviegoers, there is plenty of red for your hard-earned green this holiday season, and its name is Django Unchained.  And, yes, while the D may remain silent, it can also stands for disappointing as well. GRADE: C+Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com NOTE: Be forewarned, moviegoers: This film is one of the most violent film in recent memory. Lately, with all of the senseless murders and on-going anarchy happening in America, this film could easily become the poster child for the N.R.A. and its recent stance against gun control and Hollywood filmmakers in general.  Tarantino may not want his film to be seen in this light, but this film ( and many of his other movies ) could become a painted target for the Conservative Right mentality and close-minded gun enthusiasts with which to take aim.",5,30,51,27 December 2012
Get Out," Good from the Get-Go
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED IN BRIEF: A scary but formulaic horror film that has more to say than just 'Boo!' SYNOPSIS: An interracial couple visit the future in-laws with disastrous results.JIM'S REVIEW: There is something decidedly off from the first moments of Get Out. An eerie feeling of dread and doom that follows its tale to its bloody ending. Critics have lauded comedian Jordan Peele's mash-up of various film genres, calling it a satirical political horror thriller And as the film's writer and director, he has successfully blended these elements most astutely. But, in his first feature, he still follows a safe formula that has been seen countless times in many other thrillers. It is not as original as reported, but it is highly entertaining.￼Racism is at the core of this film and it is so subtly layered in the writing, direction, and performances, although script-wise, it loses its cleverness around the midway point and the twists and reveals were not so surprising to this reviewer. Chris and Rose (Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams), an interracial couple decide to visit the Armitage family in the affluent countryside, a picture perfect community with no real diversity in sight, except for the few black servants who tend to their needs of their employers. Rose has not told her parents, Dean and Missy (Bradford Whitford, Catherine Keener) that her boyfriend is black, but assures Chris that they are an understanding liberally-minded family. He has no need to worry. Wrong, of course.￼Paranoia quickly set in as Chris realizes that some of the town's African-American residents demonstrate odd behaviors and appearances. In the Armitage household, their slightly off-kilter son's behavior, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), may also be misleading. The Stepford Wives / The Most Dangerous Game vibe is more than intentional as tensions begin to slowly build. Get Out sends up that well-to-do white class privilege and their carefully hidden Trump values. Mr. Peale doesn't shy away from today's divisive climate and uses gallows humor to make his point. His sense of irony becomes grim as the horror elements begin to seep into the plot. His direction is skillfully handled as he creates the right atmosphere and rhythm for his film to jump-start the scares. There are plenty of well deserved jump-outta-your-seat moments to enjoy.￼The actors underplay their roles which makes the film more disturbing and effective. Mr. Kaluuya is very good as Carl. He is instantly relatable and his nuanced performance is the major catalyst for the film's success. Ms. Williams has a nice counter balance as his girlfriend. Both Mr. Whitford and Ms. Keener, two always reliable actors, are subtly discomfiting as Rose's odd parents. But the standout performance is given by Betty Gabriel as Georgina, who simmers with restrained creepiness as the loyal maid. There is also fine support by Marcus Henderson and LiRel Howery, who contributes the needed comic relief to diffuse some of the tension.￼The moviegoers in the theater were totally involved, extremely audible in their reactions to the action and gore. This demonstrative twenty-something crowd whooped and hollered their approval at every killing. They applauded numerous times at the bloody mayhem and laughed wholeheartedly at the comic relief sprinkled throughout the film. The film made the right impression with its target audience who all shared in the communal tension.Get Out is a real crowd-pleaser, but the film is not breaking any new territory as many reviewers have suggested. It's just a well crafted suspenseful, if unoriginal, horror thriller which establishes Mr. Peele as a promising director. So get out, see this film, and have some fun!",8,7,18,28 February 2017
Drive," There Will Be Blood ( and Cars )
","This film is recommended.Drive is not what it appears to be. If you are going to this action film expecting to see muscle cars, chases, fast women, speed, and plenty of crashes, you're half right. If you're in need of an absorbing crime film with startling violence, capers gone awry, and high octane suspense, you're also correct. If, however, you savor blood, guts, and splattered brain matter in excess, have we got a movie for you! Drive may be the first bi-polar schizophrenic action thriller for the unsuspecting moviegoer in search of fast and furious flicks.￼Having two jobs these days seems rather commonplace for most people. With the dismal state of the economy, the outlook for most Americans is bleak. Driver ( Ryan Gosling ) is one of those average Joes holding dual duties. His day job is professional stuntman / part-time mechanic, his nighttime work is getaway driver for different crime heists. He's a man-for- hire who knows his way around fast cars and dangerous situations, a man with no name and a man of not many words either. ( Dialogue is minimal in this film. ) He has no real goal in life. He coasts from day to day, stuck in neutral.But one eventful day he does find his sense of direction, a purpose to his lonely but highly profitable life. On that day, he meets the neighbor down the hall, Irene ( the lovely and underused Carey Mulligan ) and her son Benico ( Kaden Leos ) whose lives become entangled with him once her husband Standard (Oscar Issac ) returns home from prison.Drive is all flash and impressively glibness. The film is an efficient exercise in style and verve with L.A.'s neon colored streets serving as the backdrop for this deliberately slow paced film (at least for the first half hour, that is ). Then it kick-starts into a rousing, exciting, but ultimately superficial crime drama. The cast is made of colorful and malignant characters, thugs, and assorted lowlifes. All of the actors deliver strong support to the film. Bryan Cranston ( Shannon ) plays our antihero's so- called agent in crime. He gets him his gigs and takes a percentage of the action. Ron Perlman ( Nino ) is typecast as another goon. Comedian Albert Brooks, playing against type, is the sadistic kingpin Bernie Rose, who has a few scenes of shocking brutality that are memorably performed.Gosling's screen persona has a edgy Steve McQueen ain't-I-cool hipness that seems true to the film's macho one-dimensional character. But depth and nuance are sacrificed for action, as it should be, and usually is, in this type of genre. It's the set pieces that matter most and they need to be choreographed and energized to maximum effect. They are the money shots and Drive has plenty to offer, especially in its action-packed car chase proceeding a job gone wrong. The film's dance club mix and synthesized music score by the talented Cliff Martinez ( currently also on view in last week's film, Contagion ) help to rev up the tension, along with the trendy photography by Newton Thomas Sigel and kinetic editing by Mat Newman. All work in overdrive.Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, a name of which I was not familiar although he has directed over five films, expertly helms this escapist fare. ( He recently won the Best Director Prize at Cannes for this film. ) With so many sub-par offerings in this tiresome action genre where many films instantly become parodies on themselves, it is encouraging that this film is as fresh and original in its approach to its ordinary and rather simplistic and silly storyline.Rehn's film is stylish and arty and he flaunts the hip retro 80's coolness whenever possible. Unfortunately, he also seems to revere the School of Quentin with its escalating violence quota and double digit body count. Disappointingly, the film seems to change gears midway, from a stunt-filled action film to a bloodbath of cold-blooded mayhem. The pure shock value of the unnecessary and gratuitous violence undermine the film's tone and rhythm, getting in the way of truly reveling in the film's visceral pleasures. While the element of surprise and the clever plot twists are essential to the plot structure, this well-made film loses some of its joy and buoyancy once the blood-lust begins. With all its slickness, adrenaline rush, and pumped-up testosterone, Drive remains a souped- up but first-rate entertainment. Although the film's gory violence may be off-putting to some moviegoers, its action and complex stunt work are in ample abundance on the screen. ( During the many savage and relentlessly barbaric scenes, there were audible gasps from the movie audience, mostly from me. ) Even with all its pin-striping and flashy exterior, Drive still remains an empty vehicle. It may not be much of a joy ride, but the film has enough cheap thrills and dynamic energy, thanks to a visionary if excessive director, the strong commanding performances by Gosling and Brooks, and its stunning production values. It's worth a trip around the block at least. Just remember to buckle up, it's going to be a bumpy ride.

Aladdin," A Re-imagining of a Disney Classic Without Much Imagination
","GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite nice visuals, this movie is a lame retelling that is misdirected and generally miscast.JIM'S REVIEW: In 1992, a smart little animated musical called Aladdin brought forth its magic in the form of a wise-cracking blue genie, played by the late great Robin Williams and a wonderful original musical score by the team of Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Tim Rice. Today, the Disney Studios rest comfortably on their previous laurels and have raided their vault to resurrect their former artistic treasures yet once again. Forsaking their hand-drawn animated talents, the filmmakers re-envisioned this timeless story to become a live action / CGI adventure fantasy, more in tune with today's modern audience with shorter attention spans and insatiable action demands. (This practice seems to a repeated pattern of late, with wildly mixed results: works like The Jungle Book and Cinderella meshed quite nicely, others like 101 Dalmatians, Beauty and the Beast, and the recent Dumbo paled by comparison.)So where does this latest effort rank among all these sequels? It takes the middle ground in so many ways...entertaining but innocuous enough, a big budget production full of color and splash but lacking in grandeur and cleverness. Aladdin (2019) is re-imagining without much imagination.The film essentially follows the same storyline as Aladdin (Mena Massoud), that poor lovable thief, falls in love with his princess, Jasmine (Naomi Scott). Yet, the movie sacrifices the joyous bounce of a musical for more serious action and silly thrills. Unlike its predecessor, the film is devoid of comedy and delivers only a few musical interludes.The disjointed screenplay by John August and Guy Ritchie disappoints with its lack of wit, humor, and emotion. Where is the fun, let alone, the magic?Mr. Ritchie is a good director of action films, but his scope is limited with musical genres.He is certainly the wrong directing choice for any musical and is more concerned with kinetic quick cuts and non-stop action set pieces. He stages his movie with a flurry of chases and continually downplays most of the musical numbers as mere throwaways. Mr. Ritchie stresses the fancy CGI visuals and paces his movie with complete disregard for the basic elements of a movie musical. Singing and dancing are almost non-existent as filmed. (There is a nice Bollywood feel midway through the movie that hints of what could have been achieved in other hands.) The choreography looks interesting, but is wasted. So much is photographed from the waist up or edited in such a frenzy that one misses the footwork completely. The voices are uniformly weak, except for Ms. Scott. In fact, the film is seriously miscast in most roles.As the title character, Mr. Massoud is bland but serviceable. Will Smith plays the genie with too much hip hop flair and not much fun. He comes off as a glib imitation, never coming near the genius of Mr. William's comic riffs. Mr. Smith's patter of jokes rarely land, but at least, he is personable. His character is more of a street-wise Fresh Prince variety than Arabian prince. As the villainous Jafar, Marwan Kenzari is one note, although he never sings one note. The actor provides the menace as if he was cast in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, or worst yet, any of The Mummy movies. His character is performed with too much evil and nary an ounce of glee, without any trance of campy wickedness. It is only a very fine Ms. Scott who remains untouched by this overproduced and underwhelming spectacle. The less said about an embarrassingly bad supporting performance by Billy Magnussen, the better.The strongest aspect of the film is the CGI. The visuals are extremely well done. In fact, the CGI animal creations: Rajah the Tiger, Iago the Parrot, and especially Abu the Monkey outact their human cast-mates. The Homo sapiens should have taken some acting tips from them. While no animals were hurt in the making of this film, most humans mangled their roles.Blame must go to Mr. Ritchie for his misguided direction and the Disney Studios for green-lighting his action-themed concept. Moviegoers deserved a whole new movie version other than this sequel. This musical mishmash is far from shining, shimmering, and splendid.",5,1,4,29 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," Proof Positive
","This film is highly recommended.You can certainly tell it's Oscar time when all the more dignified and personal projects inundate the movie houses in hopes of capturing the gold. For most of the other nine months, we get lesser efforts and big blockbuster spectacles to fill-in until late October arrives. Then, it's time to get serious about our cinema choices. The Theory of Everything is one such film. It carries its pedigree with style and class, even if it is a rather conventional biopic in disguise, with its main character suffering through a debilitating disease while finding the stamina to go on.With a very literate screenplay by Anthony McCarten and accomplished direction by James Marsh, the film tells the story of famed scientist Stephen Hawking and his battle with ALS. It also concentrates on his relationship with his supportive and loving wife, Jane.Love will conquer all. Or so it should. But the horrors of this disease and the hardships they face seem unsurmountable. We see the couple meet, fall in love, marry, have children, and grow weary of each other. Stephen achieves adoration, fame, and fortune while Jane takes a back seat to her caregiver role and bringing up the family, amid the tears and frustration they face on a daily basis. One immediately empathizes with these characters due to their tragic situations.The two leads are splendid and their acting is peerless. Felicity Jones plays Jane. Her role may be less showy and far more understated, but the actress is perfect at showing Jane's endurance and strength in the subtlest of ways. Eddie Redmayne is Stephen Hawking and his performance is literally trans-formative. (He must have learned his craft from tons of research about Hawking and creative influence from Daniel Day Lewis.) This is an impressive physical performance, from his black horn rimmed glasses to his walking cane and distorted posture. Both will receive well-earned accolades for their memorable work. Fine supporting work by Charlie Cox as Jonathan, their loyal friend, and Simon McBurney as Stephen's father add more clarity to the film.As with most biographical films, one sees the rise and fall of the protagonist before it arrives. This film follows that tries-and-true formula. But Marsh's direction compensates for the linear structure and predictability of the story. The director relies heavily on his actors' subtle actions to tell more about their characters than the mere words they speak. He also wisely shows Hawking's point of view by angling the camera range from a lower stance or keeping it stationary to reinforce the characters' immobility. The final scene, recapping Hawking's life in reverse, beautifully sums up Stephen's life full circle in the most visual of terms.But The Theory of Everything is foremost a love story. The film desperately wants to be a crowd-pleaser with an uplifting message of inspiration, even when the reality and truth of their actual lives is bleaker than it appears on screen. The film glosses over some factual content to play up the human drama of this pair of young lovers. It skillfully manipulates its audience to wallow in the heartbreak. Director Marsh successfully capture the pangs of young love and bittersweet romance in this emotionally involving film. The Theory of Everything is an immensely satisfying film with stand-out acting and skilled direction. The proof is right there on the screen, even if the facts are slightly askew.

Frozen," Let It Snow!
","This film is recommended.What film could be more appropriate on a extremely cold winter night than Disney's computer animated film, Frozen. The film is loosely (very loosely) based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, The Snow Queen. In this new version, catered for today's modern audience, we meet two sisters, Anna (Kristen Bell), the good princess (what else!) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), the slightly cold but mostly misunderstood older sister (of course). Both are polar opposite in looks and personality and have that Disney cuteness going for them, but character-wise, they are distinctly different, even if the film adheres to the same crowd-pleasing conventional formula (with a few unexpected twists along the way).This plot involves the estranged relationship of two princesses. Elsa, who becomes Queen, has secret uncontrollable super powers that create endless snow and icy cold fronts that end up distancing her from her younger sibling and plaguing her kingdom. Anna sets out to rectify this problem and on her journey meets a handsome prince (there's always one per fairy tale), voiced by Santino Fontana. She befriends a handsome mountain man, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and for comic relief, his not-too-bright silent reindeer friend named Sven. We also have an even dumber sidekick, Olaf, a funny snowman who yearns to experience summer. (This character flaw leads to a wonderful musical number, In Summer, with a dream sequence that is one of the film's more successful moments.)Solidly directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, both of whom co-authored the script along with Shane Morris, Frozen has scenes that rival many Disney classics in their artistry. (Particularly memorable are an outing with trolls and the film's glorious sequence when the kingdom is trapped under a snowy mix and goes from lush greens to icy whites.) But, like other animated films of late, the film runs into script problems that prevent it from becoming a truly great children's film, with too many overly adorable interludes. Much of the dialog uses too many anachronistic phrases and modern jargon that seem totally out of sync with this tale. A few more re-writes could have taken this film to that level of excellence. ￼ Still, the animation is first-rate. The action sequences are beautifully staged and vividly detailed with lovely textures contrasting the reflective ice and powdery snow. Disturbingly, the two main female characters are such dated generic princess types with huge bug eyes and ultra-thin Barbie waists, perfect for the next new line of Disney toys but certainly not PC correct. (So much for the feminist movement!) Frozen remains a worthy visual achievement. The 3-D effects are effectively handled. The voice-over work by Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Santino Fontana and especially Josh Gad is perfection, with Alan Tudyk and Claran Hinds also providing strong support. Most of their Broadway talents come in handy with the film's strong musical score by Christophe Beck and jaunty songs by the husband-and-wife songwriting team, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. (The power ballad, Let It Go, sung by Menzel is the film's musical highlight.) ￼ Frozen is wholesome family entertainment and a fine musical treat for all ages. The film a hearty blend of stylish animation and charming story, one of Disney's best efforts in a long while. Frozen will thaw the heart of many a Grinch this holiday season and delight many moviegoers with its visual splendor. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Back in the early 1940's, Disney wanted to produce a film about Hans Christian Anderson, incorporating his stories into a mix of live action and hand-drawn animation, with one of the fairy tale segments to include The Snow Queen. Plans for that production were shelved due to irreconcilable concept issues.",8,5,7,4 January 2014
Room," A Room with a View
","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: Two wonderful performances make the film even more impressive.GRADE: A-Depending on your point of view, the world can be big and overwhelming or small and intimate. For the characters in Lenny Abrahamson's riveting film, Room, their personal experience is the sum total of a 11' x 11' area. Ma and Jack have been held captive for many years. Although Ma knows the real-life details of their lives, Jack has been spared that harsh reality. Their day-to-day survival activities include storytelling time, games, and gazing out at the piece of sky through the shed's skylight. This claustrophobic house is Jack's world.For most of Room, we are caught in the tiny confines of their room and the film makes this space an important character in itself. The director effectively uses Jack's voice-over narration and numerous close-ups of the everyday objects surrounding them to show their desperation in an isolated corner of the world. As they cling to some shred of hope and sanity, the psychological battle between captor and prisoners rages on. Jack lives in a world of naiveté and innocence. Ma tries to protect her son while still having the inner strength to carry on and shield him the awful truth.But it is the love story between mother and child that resonates and makes this film so special. The screenplay by Emma Donoghue, based on her own novel, is concise and literate. She wisely allows the visuals to tell the narrative and focuses instead on the real-life dialog between the two main characters to establish their bond and hardships.Foremost are the magnificent performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay. Their chemistry together is remarkable. Ms. Larson delivers a strong and impassioned performance. Her role runs the range of emotions and the actress uses the quieter moments to convey the angst and anger that manifests within this courageous woman. Mr. Tremblay also is in full control as he fully registers the heart-breaking moments so naturally. He inhabits his part with such confidence and authority, delineating his character's moodiness and sense of wonder with such skill. Most adult actors should envy the intrinsic talent of this 6-year old. (That this young actor was somehow excluded for an Academy Award is enough evidence to question the voting process of the Academy.) Strong work is given by Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Sean Bridgers in supporting roles as well.The film does have some issues with time passages that remain murky and more clarity is still needed with some of the minor characters who seem more like plot devices than real characters. But those details are minor complaints. Room is excellent, a film that emotionally captivates its audience with its gripping story, sensitive direction, and top-notch performances.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Null,1,6,20 January 2016
The Lion King," Dethroned
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A visually well-made remake that entertains, even if this version doesn't compare to its wonderful original source.JIM'S REVIEW: A remake is a remake is a remake. Call it what you will, give it any fancy name...a re-envisioning...a re-imagining...a re-boot, it's still second class goods all wrapped up in a new shiny package, desperate for your love and admiration. This pre-owned substitute wants to earn your respect, status, and money, but it rarely achieves its glory when compared to the original product. That adage holds true with The Lion King (2019).But first, let us pay homage to The Lion King (1994), one of the best animated films ever made. This second version is already against the odds from the start. It's a monumental challenge to outdo perfection. Roger Allers' and Rob Minkoff's film was, and still is, a perfect blending of hand-drawn animation and strong narrative structure with a little experimentation into the early realm of CGI thrown in. That innovative animated film filled the screen with artistry, awe-inspiring visuals, and characters that created a deep emotional bond. The original was just that...original. It earned its seal of approval due to its imaginative and groundbreaking vision.Twenty five years later, we now have The Lion King (2019). Lovingly remastered, this updated model is a class act, but it's not a classic as its predecessor. The computer generated imagery is masterfully done and the photo realism is incredible in its artistry. It replicates the original source with many of its iconic moments, minus some of the charm.In case you are new to the plot: This is a coming-of-age tale of Simba, a lion cub on his circle of life journey. Along the way, he befriends Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, falls in love with Nala, a feisty lioness, and battles the evil Scar who wants to rule his kingdom.This 2019 film is a highly entertaining venture with wonderful state-of-the-art computer animation. It is solidly directed by Jon Favreau who delivered a wonderful and improved remake of The Jungle Book some years back. The Lion King (2019) has a photo realistic look that one can commend for its craftsmanship and applaud all of the dedicated talent involved. The film certainly merited my admiration but this reviewer just could not feel the love tonight, or any day for that matter. This virtual reality approach to the film tended to distance this viewer rather than beguile him.(An aside: I hesitate to call this a live action version since nearly every frame is computer generated. Nothing is real except the realness. The background scenes, handsomely photographed by Caleb Deschanel, are gorgeous in their saturated colors and lushness. The animated animals are walking and talking specimens of detailed textures, astonishing true-to-life figures designed to match their living peers in every way. Dear Moviegoers, you may have a decidedly different aesthetic view on this animation style than myself. I mostly favor the direct 'old-fashioned' hand-drawn intimacy of pen to paper.)Still, one cannot see this version without the nostalgic reminders of yesteryear. There is a commonality by tradition in the inherent animated art form itself. Characters emoted in their cartoon style and the result was a triumph of line and color. In the first film, their expressions are more accepting and genuine as they pranced around and sang the pop songs by Elton John and Tim Rice. This later CGI remake seems incongruous. The natural appears unnatural as they perform the same song-and dance duties. The artistic equivalent is vastly different on screen due to the change from hand-drawn medium to computer generated technology. At times, the overall effect is oddly disconcerting and, at other times, very gratifying.The voice-over work ranges the gamut from okay to excellent. The more multi-cultural and politically correct cast includes Donald Glover (a nice addition), JD McCrary (fine as the young Simba), Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner (blending their comedic interactions seamlessly), Alfre Woodard, John Kani, John Oliver, Beyonce Knowles-Carter, and Chiwetel Ejofor (not as truly menacing in the vocal department, but a very close second to Jeremy Iron's original masterful emoting of the villainous Scar). James Earl Jones is wisely recruited to reprise his role as Simba's father, Mufasa. Oh, that glorious and unmistakable voice! (Also, welcome back to Hans Zimmer's notable instrumental music score.)All in all, the film remains highly enjoyable family fare. The final revised product is a well-made diversion that should delight today's audiences. Perhaps a younger generation might embrace this remake and its modern advances in CGI with more fervor than this reviewer, especially if they have never seen the superior 1994 version. Most of Mr. Favreau's movie is a faithful retelling of the previously successful formula, almost shot-by-shot, and rarely does the film stray from its source. It is as if the powers that be did not want to tamper with the well-loved property or disappoint the film's built-in devoted fan base, and in doing so, tamp down the genuine ingenuity of its artisans to adapt or achieve a new fresh vision. With all the technical acuity on display, the needed creative spark that abounds in the original version is somehow lacking here.Still, Mr. Favreau has given The Lion King (2019) the royal Disney treatment, although literally, its lineage is regrettably missing, which becomes its ultimate undoing. Yes, there is so very much to like in The Lion King (2019), but just not much to truly love.",8,2,10,21 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Silent Running
","GRADE: A- THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A modern horror classic that earns its scares with taut direction and strong acting.JIM'S REVIEW: Are they man-made robotic predator destroying humankind? Or are they savage alien invaders? It is never explained but the evidence is there...deserted towns, empty stores, streets with nary a person in sight. They're here and waiting for an iota of sound to signal their swift attack in John Krasinski's tension-filled horror film, A Quiet Place. A family tries to survive these dire conditions and live in a hushed world. Any sound could equal death. The moviegoing audience immediately emphasizes with their dilemma from the start. That is the clever premise behind this thriller. Interesting, but not such an original idea...the hunter being captured by the game theme, but it is handled with a high degree of skill and execution that seems refreshing and innovative. (In fact, I recently a similar effective plot and formula in an episode of the Black Mirror anthology series called Metalhead which was also very well done.) The lean screenplay by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck, and the directorconsists of efficiently paced scenes of peril and, just as the stalkers are of the slice-and dice variety, so is Mr. Krasinski's sparse and razor-sharp precision in creating a frightening world. He eliminates much exposition and hones in on the central theme of a family in crisis and a parent's responsibility to protect their children at all cost. Yes, there are a few logical missteps dealing with decibel levels rationale...(and why not just throw an object farther away from oneself to distract the attacker since it goes directly for the loudest and closest nearby sound?)In A Quiet Place, the family communicate through sign language and gestures. The slightest sound can bring doom to their doorstep. The movie wisely has minimal dialog with subtitles, and utilizes sound effects and visuals to convey the fear. It also makes the moviegoer 'listen', a rarity with today's annoyingly loud dissonant movie blockbusters that ratchet up the noise. Credit to the sound design and CGI artists, Marco Beltrami's atmospheric score, shadowy photography by Charlotte Bruus Christensen, Jeffrey Beecroft's claustrophobic farmhouse design, and, oh yes, the acting.What makes this film have its overall impact is the actors involved who show the sadness and madness of their life-or-death situation. The child actors are perfectly cast in conveying their camaraderie and familial ties. Noah Jupe and deaf actress Millicent Simmons are wonderful in their roles. Emily Blunt (Mr. Krasinski's actual wife) exudes a gamut of emotions and her chemistry with her real-life doe-eyed husband is quite palpable and convincing. (There is a lovely shared moment of the two dancing in silence before Neil Young's Harvest Moon comes into play.) And it is those quiet 'real' moments that give the film its power.Without given too much away, the film has many scenes of nerve-wrecking suspense...a scene in a grain silo, a water-filled basement, an invasion in a cornfield, etc., to name a few. There is much to admire in a film that relies less on its gore and violence and more on its characters and actions to deliver genuine scares which are frequently earned.A Quiet Place pumps up the volume and its sound of silence rings true. It is one of the year's best.",10,5,10,15 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Re-Booted and Re-Bourne
","This film is recommended.The spy thriller has come of age in recent years, bringing with it enough violence and explosions to permanently dull one's senses with its onslaught of hair-raising stunt work, kinetic chases, and exaggerated leaps off buildings that would maim or kill any mere human being. With the body count ever increasing, so must the dare-devil exploits. This genre continually tops itself to produce cheap thrills for its adrenaline-deprived audience members as it sacrifices logical leaps and sensible plotting for the sheer ride of it all. The goal seems to be: the more convoluted and fast-paced, the better the end result.The spy too has become a superstar without the super powers usually given to the comic book hero ( yet another genre that has gained popularity lately ). He usually has formidable survival instincts, neat gadgets, and undeniable strength to help him succeed at foiling the villain at all costs. This tried-and-true formula is set and really to be unleashed in the latest venture entitled The Bourne Legacy, a follow-up to the profitable Bourne trilogy ( without Matt Damon in the lead role as super agent Jason Bourne ).One can easily say that its central hero has been ' re-bourne ' in this most recent installment to the billion dollar action thriller series as Jeremy Renner takes over as our new protagonist. Renner plays Aaron Cross, one of a series of genetically enhanced agents like Bourne. Think of a bionic man gone rogue, minus the superhero status or mythology. As the agency tries to rein all of its covert operatives, Cross moves from one location to the next, from one thrilling escape to yet another.Story-wise, the film jumps around at such a frenzied pace that it becomes disconcerting. Various ideas pop up with new villains in various locales. Nothing makes a great deal of sense whenever the script tries to merge the old with the new. It doesn't successfully align the previous films with its new cast of characters and their undercover missions, but it tries. And tries. And tries. When we last saw Bourne (as in Jason ), he had plummeted into the dark watery grave never to be seen again. The Bourne Legacy begins with that similar image, except this time, it's Aaron who emerges from the cold waters. The correlation is totally intentional as the film repeatedly links the previous pedigree shamelessly. This recognition factor seems to be everyone's covert mission. Back in service with what amounts to token cameo roles written just to reinforce that Outcome are such fine actors like Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Scott Glenn. They all look dreadfully serious, waste their talents in a short speech, and earn that hefty paycheck.Inspired by Robert Ludlum's novels and directed by Tony Gilroy ( who also wrote the screenplay for this film and the previous Bourne series ), The Bourne Legacy is more of the same. It's generic repackaging, but a very well-made action film. The film is devoid any real emotional power and not as effective as the earlier efforts, but it remains standard high- concept fare. ( In those more involving films, one cared about the hero and the political fallout with its characters. With 'old' Bourne, who is always referred to in this film but never materializes, the moviegoer was piecing together his repressed identity as a trained assassin just as he was. Here, Cross already knows who he is and his career choices, so the plot is rather simplistic for our 'new' hero and the movie-going audience: it's escape, keep movin', or be killed. )The talented Renner isn't given that much to do in the acting department except to run, jump, and shoot, which he does quite efficiently. He also develops a nice rapport with Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing. Their scenes together heighten the suspense level and give the film some merit. Edward Norton brings enough menace to his role as Colonel Byer, the mastermind involved in the behind-the-scenes scenario. With all the C.I.A. cover-ups, betrayals, and killings, the film loses its ways with its talky exposition and unnecessarily intricate plotting. But what makes The Bourne Legacy worthy of viewing is the well-staged and choreographed action sequences, which, pardon the pun, are on overkill. Especially exciting are a shoot-out midway through the film and a solidly directed climactic motorcycle chase that builds tension effectively.This most recent installment continually entertains and production values are top-notch. Gilroy knows how to keeps the story moving, even if his script ( co-written with his brother, Dan ) plods along more than soars. As action thrillers go, The Bourne Legacy doesn't leave much to the imagination, but it does lead the way for other future chapters in the series. And the money kept rolling in.

Call Me by Your Name," Ode to Gay Romance
","GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Lyrical, sensual, and moving, the film is pure gay fantasy and it's beautifully acted and directed too. SYNOPSIS: In northern Italy, a teenage boy falls in love with an older man.JIM'S REVIEW: Oh, the fervor of first love. That unmistakable sexual need to be wanted by another person, to be caressed and kissed. The risk we take to be viewed as an object of desire, yearning for those glorious highs and that joyous awakening which begins our rite of passage, from innocent adolescent into the harsh realistic adult world. The journey is filled with unexpected pleasures, detours that can take one to the pinnacle of satisfaction and, in minutes, when false words are spoken or unexplained actions complicate the relationship, send us spiraling downward to the eventual low. We become the foolish spurned lover, shamed and laid barren, wondering if the mating dance was worth the whole experience. The answer is yes...better to have loved, as the saying goes...and in Luca Guadagnino's glorious ode to romance, Call Me by Your Name, we can observe those forgotten moments of ecstasy and anger with wistful thoughts and wry observation.The film chronicles the love affair between Elio, a gawky seventeen year old and his infatuation with an older man named Oliver, who is visiting Italy as a graduate student working with his father at their country villa. Set in 1980's Italy, we watch the tender give-and-take between the two and follow the seduction as it slowly unfolds. Neither can truly acknowledge their inner emotions, nor explain the palpable attraction in their hearts and minds. But theie feelings are quite tangible and the director captures that sense of awe and wonder. Mr. Guadagnino's vision is pure romance and he uses his lyrical imagery to build the tension between the two lovers.Call Me by Your Name is not remotely real. The film is strictly a gay fantasy, which takes place in a utopia free of homophobia. In reality, this public attitude rarely existed in the eighties, nor does it exist today. In fact, James Ivory's screenplay, while articulate and persuasive, avoids any semblance of the mere notion of sexual prejudice and intolerance. Any moviegoer has to disregard that lack-of-realism factor if they are to truly appreciate this lovely coming-of-age drama. The director's decision to play up the romantic intimacy and downplay the nudity and sex scenes allows the moviegoer to view this courtship in unrealistic terms while avoiding of the underlying corruption of a minor issue (at least, as viewed in American terms)...But can one justify this prevalent attitude as more free-thinking Europe in the 80's? (The AIDS epidemic was a real influence and is never mentioned in the scenario and Elio's parents seem hellbent on their liberal-mindedness in terms of their son's adolescent freedom and happiness, a stance that seemed odd to this reviewer.)The homoerotic moments are sensually charged and filmed on a grand scale by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom with his gorgeous lush panoramas and beautiful period details by Samuel Deshors reinforce the romantic tale. We are swept away and taken along, rarely questioning the sexual predator role or the corruption of a minor angle. It never enters our mind. It's pure impure romance. We somehow justify the indecency of the boy-man relationship and ignore our Puritan judgment. After all, love is love is love.Director Luca Guadagnino certainly cast his film perfectly, creating the most swoon-worthy pairing with his two lead actors, Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Their chemistry together delivers the tension and pathos of first love. (Surprisingly, with all the sexual accusations and #MeToo Movement afoot, there has not been any backlash against the man / boy theme of this film. There is some questionable intent and power games on display. Granted, the casting of Mr. Hammer as the predator seems to make the seduction and conquest more credible, but imagine another less attractive actor in this pivotal role and the subject matter would have been less accepting and reaction more judgmental.) Of course, it also helps that the two actors project that necessary allure to make the whole love story believable. And they are sensational in their roles.Mr. Chalamet plays the intense young Elio and it is an astonishing performance. The young actor displays the gamut of emotions and shows the vulnerability and confusion of a young boy trying to come to terms with his own sexual identity during homophobic times. As Oliver, portrayed by Mr. Hammer, the actor uses his masculinity as a potent fixture. He allows his character to be enigmatic in his words and deliberate in his actions. Wearing his tight-fitting pastel outfits and the shortest of shorts make a strong case for the attraction and the actor takes the risk in a difficult role and makes the character kind and, at times, slightly cruel.There are also two classic moments in this film that will be long remembered. One involves a masturbation scene that is quite sensual and handled with the utmost 'taste'. The other is given to Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's father, Mr. Perlman. He delivers a beautifully-written monologue by Mr. Ivory that sums up the film's theme. This talented actor almost steals the entire film with his emotionally-shaded soliloquy of the road not taken. He deserves award recognition for his fine interpretation of those finely-honed words. (Special mention also to Amira Casar as Annella Perlman, whose wry performance as Elio's mother says more in her subtle glances than in mere words. Esther Garrel adds fine support as Elio's girlfriend too.)Call Me By Your Name speaks so eloquently of the love that dare not speak its name. Mr. Guadagnino has crafted a lovely romanticized view of the thrill of love and has created a classic bit of gay cinema that will be embraced for decades to come.",9,0,1,21 January 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Ship of Ghouls
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Entertaining but predictable, one need not jump ship on this film series...yet!SYNOPSIS: Supernatural forces again plague Captain Jack Sparrow on his 6th voyage to misadventures.JIM'S REVIEW: In the sixth installment of this profitable film franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the McGuffin of its treasure hunt, besides trying to locate a good idea in its overly busy script, is a mysterious object called The Trident of Poseidon, which can undo any curse. A fine premise, but all this movie really does is undo any logical sense in a convoluted ho-hum plot. It's a series of fun-filled mishaps (with some fun) that involve our pirate anti-hero once again, namely Captain Jack Sparrow. Played by Johnny Depp, his role is more of the same...drunken stupor and slurred diction with comic pratfalls. Mr. Depp's colorful character is losing some of the charm in a performance that once was imbued with a twinkle of wit, a major asset in previous installments. But it is still diverting enough to entertain.Pursuing Capt. Jack on this voyage are a ship of ghouls, led by a vengeful walking dead Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem). Mr. Bardem's interpretation of this worthy foe saves this sinking ship. That, and the excellent CGI of a ghostly crew from the netherworld with assorted animated zombie-like sharks and birds help to make this nonsense more tolerable than it need be.Also back on board is Geoffrey Rush as the crafty Barbossa, who delivers some nice moments along with Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites as the young lovers (substituting for the aging Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, and minus their star power).The film retains strong production values that one has seen and expected from this big budget series. Even if the direction by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandburg is serviceable, and at times, rather inventive, the script by Jeff Nathanson (Four other screenwriters are credited with the story.) is just too formulaic and predictable. What was once an imaginative jaunt, especially on its first two adventures, is now become slightly tedious and monotonous in its execution. The action, which is non-stop, has an unfocused look, both in its plot and photography by Paul Cameron. Sometimes the film relies on too many close-ups which undercuts the action and its action sequences need some editing and better staging. (A couple of major rewrites wouldn't have hurt either.)Back in 2003, the original film was the result of a popular ride at Disney World and it gave the movie-going audience a wonderful adrenaline rush. This latest reincarnation resembles a frenzied loud cinematic ride, an apparition of its former self that only tires and rarely inspires. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales may still have interesting tales to tell. But on this voyage, the story telling needed to follow a better course.",7,0,7,29 May 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Tangled
","This film is mildly recommended.As sequels usually prove, the first time is the best. So it goes with Marc Webb's second installment of the Spiderman legend. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is an entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying movie, especially when compared to its wonderful predecessor. (That 2012 film made it to my top ten films list that year.) While there are some nice aerial movements with our comic book hero once again and time is wisely spent on the human interest angle, this latest chapter lacks interesting villains, has many (too many) action sequences that go on far too long, and enough sub-plots to foul up even the most super of superheroes. Nothing connects and the overall effect is tedious and overbearing.When we last left our Peter Parker / Spidey, (again, very well played by Andrew Garfield), he was still enmeshed in dangerous adventures to rid the world of evildoers and enamored by the sweet and independently minded Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Now, in The Amazing Spiderman 2, Mr. Parker continues to protect the citizenry of New York and pine for Gwen. He is reticent to commit to his true love due to his promise made to her dying father: end the relationship with Gwen for her own safety. The chemistry between the two leads is still palpable, due to the talented actors in these roles, and one care about this young couple and their dilemmas. But it's more of the same with less impact. Peter still has abandonment and father issues after being left behind for his Aunt May to raise, but he has lost a bit of the boyish charm and seems rather smug and cocky in this outing. (Sally Field does yeoman-like work in her small but pivotal scenes as his doting guardian.) Spiderman still fights a good fight, but his swagger and pouty expression seems interminable. Director Marc Webb keeps his action moving, but can't control the multiple story lines and narrative structure of the film. The fault is mainly with a lame script by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Jeff Pinkner that tries too hard. This screenplay by committee approach results in awkward dialog, contrived situations, and lacks any real dramatic tension. It strains when it should soar. Spiderman's clever one-line retorts aren't. The villains come in droves and two out of three are bad, but not in a good way: Electro (Jamie Foxx) is the main nemesis and his character is played sympathetically at times and pathetically for most of the other times; Rhino (a wasted Paul Giamatti) seems like a mere afterthought and lacks any gravitas; the only effective foe is Harry Osborn a.k.a. Green Goblin, who makes his appearance far too late in the film to register much of his full menace, although he is nicely played by Dane DeHaan. (There is also a dreadful evil doctor played atrociously by Marton Csokas. This actor, poorly directed by Webb, delivers his lines in a thick German accent that only Frau Blücher could love.)The CGI has its moments of awe and wonder in some of its well staged battles, but the imagery of two of its villains, Electro and Rhino, never impresses as it should. (Green Goblin, however, is a compelling force and holds promise for future encounters.) Much of the set design looks too fabricated with much noise and destruction which is so common in the crash and burn bedlam on the big screen these days.The Amazing Spiderman 2 tries to spin its web of action and suspense, but it hopelessly gets entangled in its own confusing and chaotic plot devices that continually gum up the works. Amazing it's not. GRADE: B- Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,0,3,27 May 2014
Ex Machina," Sex Machina
","(Ratings: ☆☆ ½ out of 4) This film is mildly recommended.In brief: A visual treat for the eyes, but the mind is deactivated by a dumb script. GRADE: B-Why aren't futuristic robots ever fat and ugly? I just had to ask that question, for whenever I see those female androids in sci-fi movies, they are always stunningly beautiful sleek models of perfection who become clever and resourceful adversaries. That being said, the latest prototype of artificial intelligence is on the market in the indie thriller, Ex Machina.Computer genius Caleb (Domhnall Gleason) is send on assignment to work on a top secret project in the isolated home of a wealthy CEO for the company. His boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), has a specific project in mind: an A.I. that he has created and named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ava is two thirds human parts (face, hands and feet) and one third metal and plastic, but very well-put-together, so much so that IKEA would like the patent.￼Of course, we already sense the foreboding danger before Caleb does. Writer / Director Alex Garland sets up that fact all too obviously with the physical fortress-like setting, its eerie lighting, and the actions of both Nathan and Ava from the outset. Been here, seen that before.Taking that well-worn successful formula of man's endless obsession with the bots and the bots displaying conflicting human emotion, as was the conceit of Jonzes' film her and Spielberg's A.I., Garland's film never engages its viewer emotionally. There is a nagging remoteness, not only in the fabricated Ava, but in the human characters as well. As written, Nathan and Caleb are suppose to be highly intelligent men, but their actions are self- destructive and juvenile from the get-go. The actors, who do yeoman-like work, should not be faulted, but the four character script surely can garner its share of the blame. (Sonoya Mizuno plays Nathan's mute geisha servant who supplies the frontal nudity to keep the audience awake.) The dialog is an endless existential debate about our humanity (of lack thereof) and it gets rather tedious awful fast.Garfield the Writer has larger issues he wants to tackle, but the film breaks down to a 'them vs. us' mentality rather quickly. The 'shocking' reveals and twists aren't very surprising or satisfying. Everyone acts strange throughout. But there is strange, and there is STRANGE and without logical characters and actions at play, there is no basis for credibility or interest. However, Garfield the Director has created a wonderful look for his film. He efficiently uses reflections in mirrors and glass to give Ex Machina a hallucinatory unearthly feel. The art design works overtime to hide the sci-fi failings of the script. Kudos to the art direction of for Mark Digby, Michelle Day, and Katrina Mackay and Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury's dissonant music score which adds a nice atmospheric touch and keeps the tension there.￼While the film is visually exciting to watch, Ex Machina is a hollow replicant of so many other sci-fi droid movies. Its surface is shiny and polished, but there is nothing at its core.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,7,13,3 May 2015
Magic Mike XXL," More Bumps Than Grinds
","(Rating: ☆ ½ out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: The filmmakers can adjust their junk the best they can, but junk is still junk, no matter the size.GRADE: C-Life is filled with irony. While driving home after seeing the stud dud, Magic Mike XXL, the radio station began playing You Gotta Have a Gimmick from Gypsy, that classic show- tune about strippers. Fate? Coincidence? Bad luck? Whatever, it struck me as a sign of the times. The gimmick was there: The bodies are toned and well oiled. Their moves well choreographed and fluid. Sex is for sale once again in this sequel. Only this time around, the sleaze is on slow-boil and the meat has been tenderized for consumption. The sordidness of male strippers is on the back burner as this film version celebrates the legitimacy of male dancers as a serious art form. Really? This is pure (or impure) fantasy, totally devoid of any reality. With all of its come-ons and dirty dancing (and no frontal nudity), the film never satisfies its intended audience.Magic Mike XXL is not a serious expose about the sex business as its predecessor purported to be. The first installment tried to show the dirty side of the sex-for-sale business, with its sleazy show biz world on display. Not so here. This sequel is a simple dance movie with lots of sex thrown in. It's more interested in all the right moves, but there's very little reality, plot, or logic. This version has become a road movie as Mike (Channing Tatum) and his buddies, known as the Kings of Tampa, deciding to relive their glory days by putting on one last show, an encore performance to go out in style at a stripper convention in Myrtle Beach.Dare I say, directed (and I am using the term very loosely) by Gregory Jacobs and written (even more loosely) by Reid Carolin, Magic Mike XXL is silly and naughty fun, especially made for repressed gays or horny females looking for the cheapest of thrills. The film just may be perfect for bachelorette parties too, but as a movie-going experience, it's limp.The non-direction is the main reason for this erectile dysfunction of a movie. The film lacks any subtlety or good taste with its groping and in-your-crotch shots. The film's salaciousness overpowers any fun. But the film does treat both sexes with equal disdain: men are sexual objects and women are sex crazed nymphs. What a piece of work is man!The screenplay is an absolute mess. The dialog has an improvisational vibe that is incomprehensible most of the times and stilted the rest of the times. It wants to impress with hip rap, gangster swagger, and non-stop f-bombs, as if to say, 'I'm cool', but it all comes across as just plain silly and labored. The story spends too much time meeting various characters that never amount to much. Scenes need judicious cutting and go on endlessly (a visit to a black private club, a meeting with some older repressed Southern ladies, a drug- filled night on the beach).Most of the choreography (by Alison Faulk) is sexual gyrations and simulated sexual posing, although it is hard to tell what action is being done on stage due to the lousy editing that is too close for comfort and rarely shows off the dance moves and some of the worst photography to be seen in a major studio film: ugly, grainy, out of focus and usually shot in a dinghy yellow-brown hue. Surprisingly, Steven Soderbergh mishandled both duties.The cast is uneven. Except for Mr. Tatum, who really can dance, Matt Bomer who tries to develop his ill-gotten pretty boy role, and the charismatic Joe Manganiello who truly looks the part, the others boy toys just mill around bonding and getting high or drunk. The most uncomfortable of the lot seems to be Kevin Nash as Tarzan who plays his role more Neanderthal than human. Also adding little to the film except for a winning smile and nice set of abs are Adam Rodriguez as Tito and comedian Gabriel Iglesias in the role as an unfunny stooge named Tobias. However the strangest part of the film is a tawdry cameo by Michael Strahan (of sports and talk show fame). His contribution, a graphic lap dance with an obese woman, is an embarrassment of bad taste that sets back women rights and questions the real motives of the filmmakers and this television personality's dubious career choices. Adding to this debacle are the wasted talents of Addie MacDowell, Elizabeth Banks, Amber Heard, and Jada Pinkett Smith. The dance showdown at the stripper convention peters out really fast (pardon the pun) with no real climax (again, my apologies) as the film follows its predictable conclusion. But there are some dance sequences that do work quite effectively: Channing's all too short scene in his 'body' shop, an amusing segment with Mr. Manganiello in a convenience store, and the final dance-off involving mirror images of Channing and Stephen 'tWitch' Boss (underused) that become an R-rated version of a So You Think You Can Dance routine. (It makes sense since the choreographer and dancer worked on that television show.)As that clever song from Gypsy so aptly states: 'If you wanna grind it, Wait till you refine it.' Magic Mike XXL hits more than its share of bumps than grinds, with no refinement in sight.

Hidden Figures," Making It All Count
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A trio of fine performances empower an uplifting tale of tolerance and strength.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: Three African-American women overcome prejudice and use their talents working at NASA during the early 60's.JIM'S REVIEW: Hidden Figures, a docudrama solidly directed by Theodore Melfi, tells the true story of three African-American women whose talents with numbers brought them together to work on the space program at NASA. Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) became the brains behind one of America's greatest achievements in history: the successful orbit of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell). Dealing with Jim Crow laws and discrimination due to their race and gender, these pioneers contributed to the Civil Rights movement. The film tells their untold story with much understated power. There are some intriguing unknown facts at play in the literate screenplay by the director and Allison Schroeder (humans called computers / outdated technology like the massive IBM machines / segregated book sections in public libraries, many African-American secretaries working at NASA, etc.) The script shows the racial inequities in the subtlest of ways.￼Still, there is a bit of whitewashing over the more brutal aspects that occurred during the early 1960's era against the 'colored' race. None of the violence is shown in gut-wrenching honesty. It's all a little too sanitized. and the lead characters come off a tad saintly. There also seems to be a large degree of fictitious composites with some of the supporting characters in order to create dramatic conflict for our trio of crusaders. These bigoted 'white folk' come off more plot devices than as actual people. However, the story itself is always involving and handled extremely well. The end result may be more crowd-pleasing than realistic, but as entertainment goes, historical accuracy is second place to real enjoyment.The lead actresses are superb. Ms. Henson, Ms. Spencer, and a beguiling Ms. Monáe create vivid characters and their chemistry is electric. One immediately roots for their inevitable success throughout the film. Kevin Costner, Jim Parsons, Kirsten Dunst, and Mahershala Ali co- star, and they all bring great nuance to their stock characters.Mr. Melfi re-creates the turbulent times with a restrained vision. He never overdoes the injustice angle, although a little more anger may have more impact for this reviewer. That said, Hidden Figures is a film that finally recognizes the talents and determination of these African-American women who overcame obstacles in their everyday lives. The film deserves your attention. This is one of the most important feel-good movies of the year, with more uplift in their stories than the customary lift-off of a NASA launch itself. Go see it.NOTE: The film score by Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, and Benjamin Wallfisch added a nice R & B flavored vibe to the film. Especially strong was the theme use of the song Runnin' and closing credit song, Mirage, with Mary J. Bilge's powerful vocals. Very impressive.",9,3,17,10 January 2017
Coco," Bright Colors, Dull Script
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 stars) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A visually stunning film with an unfortunately weak story that needs constant resuscitation (and a few rewrites) to breathe some life into it.SYNOPSIS: A young boy must come to terms with Death in order to celebrate life.JIM'S REVIEW: Bright colors dazzle. Characters morph into skeletal figures. Life becomes a struggle with Death. These very macabre settings celebrate the Day of the Dead in this off- kilter animated children's film that is big on visual splash but a tad weak in storytelling and charm. Welcome to the world of Coco.￼As with most animated films these days, the story rarely matches the visual flair. And, in this case, the story and plot never quite makes logical sense: Miguel, the young hero in the story, wants to be a musician but is not allowed to utter a single note due to a family tradition of banning music from their household. It seems that his great great grandmother, the title character named Coco, had a mother who was deserted by her musician father who put fame and fortune ahead of family. Yet Miguel has the need to sing out, inspired by his late great idol, Ernesto de la Cruz. This leads him unexpectedly to visit the Land of the Dead. Convoluted? Wait...and he must get back to the Land of the Living by sunrise if he wants to return to his family ever again. Huh? Like I said, if I have problems following the story, younger children will be lost as well.￼There is also so much exposition in this film, too much in fact, in order to set-up the complicated plot structure. Some rewrites by the director Adrian Molina and Matthew Aldrich would have certainly helped to define the characters and their actions. Our small hero, Miguel, is cute and endearing, but not very appealing with his big doe eyes and Pillsbury dough boy generic face. He resembles a good-looking Cabbage Patch kid. Coco is essentially a minor major character, with about as much screen-time as Dame Judi Dench in Shakespeare in Love, but she makes a lasting impression in a touching closing scene which is Pixar's forte. Actually Hector, Miguel's sidekick in this Dead Man's Land, provides more interesting and the animators have some fun delivering some needed humor with his movable skeletal parts. Voice-over work is fine with Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Benjamin Bratt as standouts. ￼Mr. Molina and Lee Unkrich co-directed this movie and they keep the action moving along at a nice pace while sacrificing character development for action. The songs aren't very memorable either, although the main ditty, Remember Me, is at least hummable. So what makes the film worth your time and money? It's purely the spectacle of state-of-the-art animation that is a remarkable step forward in animation.￼Yes, it is the visual artistry on display which elevates this tale. Colors shimmer unlike most animated films. A note-worthy phosphorous glow throughout the film's many sequences gives the film its distinctive visual quality. The intensity of light adds a unique richness to the backgrounds which upstages most of the underwritten characters and unfocused plot. There are also lovely textures with the wooden carved faces of the skeleton figures, detailed animal spirits that glisten, and a transfixing luminescent ethereal world that adds to the mystique of the overall production.￼The color palette is stunning state-o-the-art animation. Vivid in its saturation point and rendered in amazing exactness. Coco is unadulterated eye candy. Oranges contrast against azure backgrounds...deep purples blend into shades of crimson. It's a glorious mix of hues that would beguile any moviegoer.￼But originality and imagination come to an abrupt stop with the film's dull screenplay. This is conventional storytelling, not worthy the artistry that surrounds it. (2014's The Book of Life followed a similar subject, with weaker results, and although the images in Coco are truly remarkable, the plot is not.) There is a nifty twist midway that almost explains some of the illogical loose strands of the plot, but it comes a bit late.￼The doltish script never reaches the same level of excellence as the masterful images on screen. And let's face it, the subject of death is a real downer, especially in a children's film that has very few comedic moments to lighten its heavy subject. However, kudos to the film's multicultural message, its all-inclusive Latin American actors doing voice-over work, and to Pixar Studios for tackling such an adult theme while staying true to the story's Mexican heritage.￼Coco is a solid achievement, a good film that is dressed to the tens. But all of the visual trickery can't hide its empty-headed plot.",8,1,5,9 December 2017
1917," In the Trenches
","GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A stunning visual testament to WWI.JIM'S REVIEW: Masterful in its direction and technically impressive, Sam Mendes' war epic, 1917, is a straightforward tale based on actual events about a dangerous mission during WWI. The dialog is minimal as is the character development. It is all action-based storytelling about two young British soldiers trying to stop an ambush behind enemy lines.Those corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) focus on their goal to save lives while risking their own. The film is a series of perilous detours to deliver their message. It's part Saving Private Ryan meets Dunkirk. While it vividly shows the horrors of war and the heroic determination of those in the military, it rarely reaches a level of emotional connection. It is a tad too clinic in its approach with its narrative structure, as we go from one danger to the next. Sure, we care, but not to degree of gravitas that we should feel.Yet what makes this film so unique is the visual sweep of the film. Technically speaking, the imagery is powerful and Roger Deakin's superb cinematography is immersive on a grand scale. 1917 is staged as one continuous tracking shot. The fluidity of camera movement is astonishing and takes the moviegoer directly in the trenches and mud-soaked fields, unlike any other war film.Adding to the tension is Thomas Newman's haunting music score, Lee Smith's precise editing, and Dennis Gassner's production design that brings a sense of stark reality to Mr. Mendes' vision. While his screenplay, co-authored by Krysty Wilson-Cairn, would definitely benefit with stronger use of dialog to build greater interest and further depth of its characters, the visceral rush of the life and death events greatly compensates for this minor deficit.The director also wisely casts his film with unknown actors in the lead roles which provides more authenticity to his storytelling. Mr. Chapman and especially Mr. MacKay are excellent in their roles. They become the human faces of war in their physically demanding parts and most of the film's success depends on their nuanced portrayals. However, the sight of famous British actors in supporting roles like Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Richard Madden, and Andrew Scott undoes that casting decision, despite their fine acting contributions.1917 is a stirring testament to those who shall not grow old, told with extraordinary skill and the utmost respect to these fallen heroes.NOTE: The one shot tracking device has always intrigued filmmakers.
Alfred Hitchcock (Rope), Stanley Kubrick (Paths of Glory, The Shining, A Clockwork Orange), Orson Welles (Touch of Evil), and Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas) are just a few directors who plied their craft to this gimmick. Now add Sam Mendes to this illustrious group of artisans. 1917 is a memorable filmgoing experience due to his artistry and vision.Rent Peter Jackson's magnificent WWI documentary, They Shall Not Grow Old as a companion piece. Together, they tell the whole story.",9,0,2,14 January 2020
Lincoln," A Lincoln Portrait for the Ages
","This film is highly recommended.Film biographies have also seemed to be a stodgy affair, the biased mishandling of fact and fiction to make the subject more compelling than life itself. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is a remarkable achievement, a concise and engaging film that treats both the man and the myth with an evenhandedness and craft that simply impresses the moviegoer at any level.The film is based on the best-selling novel, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin, but the director shrewdly focuses the film on Lincoln's final months and the the passing of the 13th Amendment. As war rages on and the nation is torn apart, the political climate is awash with abolitionists and pro-slavery forces, with neither sides willing to bulge or be nonpartisan. ( Sadly, history continues to repeat itself. )Spielberg has always been one of our most accomplished directors and here he shies away from his tendency to sentimentalize this subject matter and make it more palpable for mass consumption. He renders the brutality of war with mere images of the carnage that became the Civil War and layers his film with that high cost of freedom. There is no dumbing down of the story, plot, or its large cast of characters. Everything is richly created, with a high level of excellence in the production design by Rick Carter, gorgeous photography and lighting by Janusz Kaminski, an unfussy and stirring score by John Williams, and wonderful period costuming by Joanna Johnson. Foremost is a literate screenplay by the talented Tony Kushner that engages the audience from the start. Kushner's dialog, characterizations, and speeches have an intellectual and poetic nuance that distinguishes this film from other standard film biographies. Lincoln has a tendency to bog down a bit with the internal political manipulations and schemes needed to ratify this amendment to the Constitution. In fact, some scenes about the internal battles of the politicians became somewhat repetitive to me. Additional screen time and depth given to the president's personal life and less emphasis on the governmental bureaucracy would have made this film even more compelling.However, Spielberg seems more interested in the ethical complexities of the issue of slavery and the moral consciences of the politicians at that time than Lincoln's family dynamics. He even uses some actors as a pseudo Greek chorus to establish more clarity for the movie audience and mirror those legislative point of views. Spielberg tries to equate the similarities of America's government then and now ( the use of lobbyists, the influence of the media, the wheeling and dealing to sway a vote ) and he succeeds brilliantly. The director assembles an excellent cast in telling his story. At the center of the film is a towering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president. His lanky physique, angular facial structure, and awkward demeanor truly captures the man and our predetermined notion of him. Throughout the film, Day-Lewis eloquently delivers many speeches, tirades, and witticisms with much authority and passion. His portrayal is wholesome, restrained, and understated, quite powerful in its completeness.Among the many supporting roles that standout ( Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lee Pace, Stephen Spinella, Gloria Reuben, and the trio of James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Hawkes ), two veteran actors invest themselves wholeheartedly into their roles: Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones. As Mary Todd Lincoln, Fields distances herself from the clichéd crazy First Lady persona and brings a stateliness and emotional center to the film. Her bond with Lewis seems authentic and helps to add the most affecting moments to the film. Jones plays Thaddeus Stevens as a highly moral but audacious and impudent politician, a man not afraid to bully a rival into submission or change course for the cause of equality. Along with Day-Lewis, both Field and Jones should be getting more accolades this award season.Historically speaking, it is safe to state that Lincoln was a great man. Cinematically speaking, it is also safe to say that Spielberg's Lincoln is a great film.

Sing Street," With a Song in Its Heart
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.JIM'S REVIEW: The sounds of Duran Duran, aha, The Cure, and Hall and Oates bring the 80's back in full swing in John Carney's ode to youth, Sing Street. The film delivers a coming of age story about the makings of a boy band and the pangs of first love front and center. In Dublin, teenage Conor Lawlor (a winning Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) must deal with his parents divorcing, a new school, a sadistic schoolmaster who wants conformity, a bully, and the perfect model of a girlfriend (Lucy Boynton). His life is a shamble until he is guided into the world of music by his slacker brother, Brendan (Jack Raynor). It is there that he begins to find purpose and literally, a voice.The film is charming, even if its plot is thin and in need of more character development. Mr. Walsh-Peelo, in his film debut, shares a nice chemistry with his band-mates, Ms. Boynton, and Mr. Raynor. But it is the original music score by the director and Gary Clark that carries the story. Its direct homage to the 80's pop bands of that era and their original song contributions to the film, like Drive It Like You Stole It and The Riddle of the Model, are post new wave gems. Even though there is a lack of credibility with these young musicians sounding too polished for their age, the overall effect is a rollicking good time. So tease that hair, put on those tight stone-washed jeans, and want your MTV. Sing Street will play on.

Big Hero 6," We All Need Another Hero
","This film is mildly recommended. ☆☆ ½ Disney and Marvel have joined forces to beget Big Hero 6, a computer animated film about a boy and his pet robot. They have created wondrous worlds and interesting enough characters only to place them in the most mundane plot. The film starts off promisingly with plenty of awe and joy but finally dissipate into one action chase sequence after the next. Now this may sell toys and merchandise at a hefty profit but the cost of their own creative ingenuity and soul is the price paid. Most animated features nowadays feed into the video game frenzy with its loud aggressive action and pop spectacle sacrificing fully developed characters and the remains of a plot for large screen destruction. Big Hero 6 is once again that type of film showcase. As in the past, just like other well-crafted predecessors (Wall-e, Brave, Frozen, Cars, and Planes, for example), this film is wildly (and unevenly) entertaining before it falls victim to this malady. (Some animated films like Ratatouille, Up, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story franchise have successfully sidestepped these pitfalls with stronger and more cohesive scripts with a satirical bent.) In Big Hero 6, we are somewhere in the future, in SanFransokyo to be more precise, a mash-up of both metropolises. Living there is our main human character, a teenage gamer and bot fighter named Hiro. Hiro is an intelligent but aimless computer geek, unlike his big brother Tadashi who is a robotic whiz and has created a cutting edge robot named Baymax. After tragedy befalls Hiro, he is forced to join forces with Tadashi's lab mates and battle an evil mastermind. (Parents, be forewarned that on a scale from 1 to 10, the emotionally scarring damage of this sad event to your child psyche could fall midway between Bambi's mother's demise as 1 and the traumatic killing of Old Yeller as a 10.)The moviegoer is taken on a diverting journey, but it's one that never lives up to its clever beginnings. Big Hero 6 doesn't achieve its true potential when the end nears. It wears itself out with too many well-staged but dramatically inert chase scenes. The results are predictable and so formulaic. The film reads like a rejected X-Men comic, far too simplistic in structure and pacing.Literally, the heart of the film is the lovable and huggable Baymax, the most distinctive character in the entire film. The animators have done wonderful things with him, from his sluggish movements, sound design and his rubbery latex exoskeleton. All of the others in the film pale by comparison. In fact, the characters, as drawn, lack any real presence. However, kudos go out to the detailed and creative background designs of San Fransokyo which show a lot more imagination than this woebegone script. (Surprisingly, six writers are credited with this lame story and its semi-plot that is more concerned with action than characters.)Big Hero 6 is strictly a heroes vs. villain by-the-comic-book affair. It could have been so much more rewarding if it would have just focused on the relationship between Hiro and Baymax and their bonding instead of veering uncontrollably off-course for the sake of action. As it is, the film is still visually strong and has some charming humorous moments, mostly due to our walking marshmallow of a hero's fish-out-of-water existence. However, Baymax will make a nice expensive toy for parents to buy this Christmas...a win-win strategy for Disney/Marvel, but a win-lose situation for the more sophisticated lovers of film animation.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Staying Within the Lines
","GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A good-looking but convention re-mash from most of the series. SYNOPSIS: The Resistance fighters fight the First Order...once again and again.JIM'S REVIEW: There is really nothing any critic could say, let alone myself, to stop the phenomenon known as Star Wars. The force has been (and will be) with this film franchise for decades to come, making this latest chapter in the most profitable series in movie history all the more memorable. And yes, Star Wars:The Last Jedi is a worthy addition to this space age saga, just not a very creative or moving one.Rian Johnson (Looper) is a fine choice to serve as the film's director. He has enough visual panache to wow his targeted audience, although he doesn't stray to far from the tried-and-formula that sustains this franchise. (The use of blood red throughout the film gives it a stately look.) He delivers an action-packed thrill ride at warp speed, but loses the excitement and its characters in a middling story. The plot remains simplistic, a good vs. bad scenario, with enough sub-plots to perk up the interest if one story strand starts to meander, which it does. Our heroine and female power player, Rey (Daisy Ridley), is now under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker (a winning Mark Hamill) to learn the necessary skills to combat the most evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). While she is gaining that knowledge base, other Resistance fighters are in combat mode. This includes, from our last outing, Hans Solo substitute, fighter pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac) and rogue soldier Finn (John Botega). And of course, that former princess turned general, Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) is there, bringing the needed nostalgia and pathos to her final role.New additions to the cast include Laura Dern, Kelly Marie Tran, and Benicio Del Toro. A still less visible Gwendoline Christie, who was wasted as a mere footnote in the last chapter, has a memorable exchange toward this film's climax, although she is well hidden in her mask and armor..so much for emoting and acting lessons. Domhall Gleeson as General Hux takes on that challenge effectively. We even have cute pogs taking the place of Ewoks for the younger crowd. And the great Andy Serkis is center stage as the powerful Snoke, a great CGI villain. Everyone is assembled to combat their personal conflicts and deal with their angst, ready to fight the fight most effectively...except it takes most of the film for these characters to finally come together. There is definitely a pay-off in the third act, but getting there is a challenge of sorts. Nothing seems to have been overlooked, well, except a real emotional drama. It's all surface treatment, visually stunning and artfully crafted...a very good veneer to behold. But when one looks deeper, less is less.The basic problem is a screenplay (written by the director) that is essentially uninspired. The narrative is disjointed and not very creative, borrowing too closely from set pieces and similar characters from other chapters in this series for contemporary audiences (Mos Eisley Cantina vs. a casino on Canto Bight, both with jam-packed with delightful alien creatures / Rey is Luke / Poe resurrected to become the new Han Solo, etc.) Not very original but it's safe, cozy, and familiar to its fan base. However, these established and endearing characters deserve better dialog and are in need of some real tension and drama, Luke, Leia, Daisy, Finn should not be mere props for battle. Also, the editing doesn't allow flow of its chunky plot and undercuts the characters and their individual missions numerous times. Humor is apparently in short supply as the movie takes itself far too seriously.Still, Star Wars: The Last Jedi still entertains. There is plenty of fine CGI, nicely staged aerial battle sequences, and some nifty hand-to-hand lightsaber duels thrown in for good measure. Excitement and tension builds to many ultimate showdowns so that action fans won't be disappointed. Let us hope that the filmmakers for the next installment go a bit rogue and resist the real evil: conventional storytelling. Staying safely within the lines does not make a great movie. With such a force of talented artisans behind them that can dazzle us with enough visual showmanship. Star Wars: The Last Jedi remains a feast for the eyes, but does little to move the soul.",7,1,7,23 December 2017
Brave," Bravehair
","This film is recommended.The title for the new Pixar / Disney collaboration, Brave, seems a bit of a contradiction of terms. Unlike other ground-breaking animated features like Ratatouille, Up, Wall-e, Finding Nemo, or its Toy Story trilogy, where artistry and story perfectly mesh, this offering plays it all too safe in its narrative while still awing the movie-going audience with breathtaking CGI effects. ( This film is more of a minor achievement, in line with Monsters, Inc. and Cars. ) Perhaps, the once edgy and creative Pixar is becoming more conventional and too much concerned with the Disney marketing machine. Hopefully that is not the case.The story is rather predictable and its message too preachy. An independently-minded princess ( sure to be in toy stores from the holidays ) named Merida wants nothing to do with marriage or hand-picked suitors to wed. Merida would rather climb mountains, ride horseback and shot arrows. It's girl power all the way! Her mother, Queen Elinor, would rather that her daughter be more ladylike and refined and follow the traditions of the past. This leads the princess to take matters into her own hands.The film's strengths are in the visual detailing. Pixar is known for its glorious textures and stunning settings, and in Brave, that continues to be its forte. ( The renderings of animal fur done in a photo-realistic style, the transparent liquidity of water and rain, the panoramic vistas of forests, fields, and streams, all these elements help to enhance this tale. Particularly impressive is the facile expressions and movement of the bears in this film and the stylish exaggeration of the film's secondary characters. ( Not so impressive: A major misstep are the characters of the Queen which lack any real dimension and our heroine, Merida, who becomes a living Kewpie doll creation, far too cute and rather bland in the mix. ) Voiceovers by Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompson, Billy Connolly, and Julie Walters truly capture the Scottish lilt and add the right tone and rhythms to the dialog. However, the slim story never takes hold. It downplays the more serious dramatic issues and emphasizes the comedy. There is no good vs. evil side, no real villain to hiss at. ( One is introduced midway, but its seems an afterthought and doesn't build any tension at all. ) Everyone around the two strong-willed but essentially dull central characters of mother and daughter is portrayed as a clownish buffoon or an oafish lout. In fact, all of the male species in Brave serve as comic fodder while the women are seen to be far superior in intellect and manner. At times, I personally found this conflict to be chauvinistic to the male gender as the film exults the female liberation aspects in such a heavy-handed and biased way.Yet there are certain scenes in the film that are such wonderful examples of state-of-the- art animation and this artistry elevates the film to a higher level of worth. ( The archery contest, the fishing scene, and the climactic hunt come to mind. ) But the sum of the film's individual parts outweigh the overall effect. Brave might have been given the royal treatment by all of the artisans involved with this venture, but its pure-bred pedigree falls short of its Pixar predecessors. Let's hope their next project will center on a more demanding and compelling script and return this studio to its glory days of Ole.

Guardians of the Galaxy," In Another Galaxy Far, Far Away
","This film is recommended.Finally a comic book blockbuster that doesn't take itself so seriously and never gets bogged down with all of its mythological narratives and sci-fi claptrap as so many do. Here is a film which also gives itself time to establish interesting characters and situations before all the CGI kicks in, with full doses of humor and wit to spare. Such is this unexpected surprise called Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes, one can easily see the Marvel franchise concocting sequel after sequel of this motley crew and their fool-hardy adventures in future installments, but just sit back and enjoy this original source while you can.This film is a fine send-up to the 1977 granddaddy of them all, George Lucas' Star Wars. It even follows its characters and plot somewhat. Just substitute Hans Solo, Luke, Princess Leia, Chewbecca, and the droids for this new group of space age crusaders: Peter Quill (Chris Pratt, totally buff, confidently sexy, and channeling a young Harrison Ford), a handsome daredevil of a pilot, Gamora , a Xena-like warrior princess (played by Zoe Saldona a.k.a. the reigning Sci- Fi Queen, thanks to an impressive resume that includes Avatar and the Star Trek films), and, as comic relief, a trio of cohorts including Drax (overly muscled WWF wrestler Dave Bautista), Groot (a walking talking stick figure voiced by Vin Diesel) and a CGI wise-cracking gun-toting raccoon named Rocket, who gets most of the best comic one-liners (superbly delivered by Bradley Cooper). Yes, a new generation of misfit heroes for a new generation has arrived.The far-too-convoluted yet simple-minded plot revolves around a missing and most powerful orb that can destroy the universe. (Shades of The Green Lantern!) Of course, there are an onslaught of villains, far too many, to serve as obstacles for our gang of heroes: Nebula (Karen Gillan), Korath (Djimon Hounsou), and as our modern day Darth Vader, a black hooded figure named Ronan (Lee Pace). Also aboard for the ride are: Glenn Close, Benicio Del Toro, and John C. Reilly in small and seemingly insignificant parts (at least in this first chapter). But none of that really matters. It's the exciting action sequences and the interrelationship between the film's characters that are the important elements for this film to succeed, and succeed it does! While much of the battle sequences lack visual focus with invasive upfront close- ups and shaky camera-work, the essence of comic book pandemonium is still up there on the screen.Solidly directed by James Gunn, with a clever screenplay by Nicole Perlman and Gunn himself, Guardians of the Galaxy is a nostalgic throwback to more innocent times. Its purposeful 70's pop music score helps bask in the glory of a happier era, when science fiction was once king, so long before all the gore and violence seeped into its core. But that was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...GRADE: B",8,3,7,4 August 2014
Evil Dead," There Will Be Blood ( and More Blood )
","This film is not recommended.Yesterday's creative ideas can easily become today's cliché. The perfect case in point: Sam Raimi's 1981 low budget thriller, The Evil Dead, a true cult classic in the horror genre. ( In fact, Raimi and his star of that film, Bruce Campbell, are co-producers of this update, so much of this new film's flaws belong to them too.)The original film had lousy acting, a dumb script, and bad production values, but it also brought with it the innovative director's keen vision and camera-work, plus some wit, to redeem its bloody limitations. This new reincarnation, directed by Fede Alvarez, essentially follows that story with some interesting tweaking, but it sorely lacks the humor and real suspense of its predecessor. However, what is doesn't lack is Alvarez's inventive ways to systematically dispose of his young victims and his obsession with more detailed close-ups of grisly deaths and dismemberment. ( Alvarez does seem to have an unhealthy and morbid obsession with tongues in this version.) Entertainment to some, but for me, not very satisfying. ( But then, I never much liked mincemeat either.)For those who may not know the basic plot, it goes like this: Five friends go to that cabin in the woods and find a heavy flesh-bound volume entitled The Book of the Dead, where upon these sacrificial lambs unleash those evil spirits that will later maim and torture them. ( Right away, the savvy moviegoer begins to wonder the I.Q. of these people, but we go along with the premise anyway. It's all par for the course. )The acting is still less than stellar, with the exception of Jane Levy as Mia, who comes to this remote forest via intervention for her drug abuse. ( This is one of the few revamped touches that improves upon the original version. adding some logical sense to the story. When she starts hearing voices and seeing things, the others really don't know if she is hallucinating or possessed. ) Needless to say, they begin to find out, one by one.This downgraded version trades its cleverness for graphic torture scenes involving all sorts of tools to aid in the increasing body count: pliers, box cutters, nail guns, meat slicers, machetes, the tried-and-true chainsaw, etc. ( ACE Hardware really should have paid for the product endorsement rights. ) Yet the real horror in horror films these days is the latest advances in state-of-the-arts technology in its bloodcurdling realism. The filmmakers had nary an ounce of creativity or humor added to their new revision, rarely straying from the formulaic plot structure or improving upon the earlier film. But they seem to pool all their skills to gleefully share in their bloody pound of flesh. Self-mutilation has never looked so darn good! ( I have to say that I turned away from the screen numerous times to avert the violent onslaught of carnage on the screen. It is an understatement to say that this film is not for the squeamish.)Evil Dead (2013) slaughters the essence of its original source to satiate today's modern movie-going audience's thirst for blood and gore. Less is more, but that old adage is too often forgotten by filmmakers and producers and far away from the clichéd nowadays.Perhaps, the next sequel ( and yes, there will be another in this series ) should be titled: Evil Dead 2: Pardon Me Sir, Is That a Chainsaw in Your Hand, or Are You Just Happy to See Me?

The Imitation Game," Game On!
","This film is highly recommended.This year we have witnessed the rebirth of the bio-pic, films that are based on real life people and their 'based-on-a-true' story genre. Most have been very sincere and earnest undertakings, telling those life stories with varying results from the superb to the overwrought. The Imitation Game falls into the former category and is one of the best films of the year. In Morten Tyldum's film, we follow the life of British mathematician and genius Alan Turing, a major force who, along with a team of similarly-minded decoders from Bletchley Park, help to end WWII by decrypting the Germans' top-secret messages called the Enigma Code. This hero fall from grace is the crux of this history lesson and makes for some powerful drama. That Turing also suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, stressing odd behavioral tics, strange mannerisms, and distancing him from others, plus carrying with him an illegal love that dare not speak its name, this solemn character has more than his share of hardships to overcome. That he is played by the resourceful and talented Benedict Cumberbatch only makes the film all the more watchable. Cumberbatch gives an astonishing performance. The actor zeroes in on his character's eccentricities in his stammers and hesitated speech patterns. His down-turned look and sudden glances add to Turing's many foibles in the most subtle of ways. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a smart no-nonsense British working girl who befriends Alan makes him become more human. Knightley brings an authenticity and poignancy to her role. Their final heartbreaking scene together has so much more impact due to their natural chemistry together and the nuanced acting choices these gifted performers bring to these two mismatched loving friends. The entire ensemble deserve kudos for their fine support: Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Allan Leech, Matthew Beard, Charles Dance (a perfect foe), and Mark Strong. Alex Lawther as a young Alan Turing and Jack Bannon as his friend, Christopher round out this glorious cast.Director Tyldum crafts a fine film and keeps the exposition to a minimum with effective use of war montages to visualize the era. He paces the film well and builds tension with the emotional and numerical parameters that are set within the limited technology that these crypt-analysts dealt with on a daily basis.The literate screenplay by Graham Moore tells its story without pandering to its audience. It expects moviegoers to pay attention to the quick-witted dialog and clever exchanges between all of its well drawn characters. The film structure bounces from Turing's childhood to his life after the war and the time-line becomes a tad disconcerting. Alan's private illicit life appears to be downplayed as to be non-existent, a decision that contradicts the film's tragic ending.The Imitation Game is a timeless and engrossing film that shows the dedication and sacrifice of one man's obsession to do the right thing when all the wrong things finally overwhelm and destroy his own life. Turing's final days will always remain an enigma to the world, that a man who gave so much of himself was given so little respect and love in return. At least this film is a well deserved testament to a great man. GRADE: A-",10,6,13,29 December 2014
Jurassic World," Let Us Prey
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: Dinosaurs again prey on humans in this enjoyable but very predictable installment.GRADE: BChomp! The sideshow has finally arrived...once again! Thrills await! Step right up and see heroic derdoings! Gaze at the reptilian marvels on display before they are unleashed to the masses wreaking havoc on their prey. Watch damsels-in-distress flee from the monstrous hordes of wizardly lizards. (And man, can she run in high heels!). Witness scenes of spectacular state-of-the-art CGI. The media circus is here as the summer movie season descends with Jurassic World literally leading the pack for your attention and enjoyment. It has been 14 years since the last dinosaur outing of the Spielberg trilogy. This latest installment is not directed by him but he was involved in its making. Now, solidly directed by Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World doesn't earn its rightful pedigree like its more original and innovative source, but it qualifies as delirious sloppy seconds in its earnestness to create scares and its ability to entertain.There is no sly wit, no clever banter, no memorable set pieces (like in the classic kitchen sequence with the Raptors in the original Jurassic Park). It just one chase scene after the next with no character development in sight. But the action is good and somewhat suspenseful. The dinosaurs are real and lifelike, especially compared to their human counterparts.Chris Pratt takes on his Indiana Jones role with much charm and bravado. Bryce Dallas Howard has the thankless stereotypical role of the icy career woman who will thaw out once she gets her man. Vincent D'Onofrio is all caricature, a cartoon villain and nothing more. Only Nick Robinson, Judy Greer, and Jake Johnson bring some nuance to their one-dimensional characters. Basically, the rest of the actors are just pawns to a weak script. They are there solely as appetizers for the scaly inhabitants of the island. The biggest shock is that this screenplay-by-committee was created by a quartet of writers (including the director) who were all unable to bring any depth or logic to this lamest of stories. The set-up is so formulaic from all of its other versions, even down to its incompatible couple and two children in peril.At best, the film lampoons our insatiable need for 'more' thrills and targets our self-serving theme park mentality of instant gratification. Yet in so many scenes, product endorsements with the likes of Coca-Cola, Pandora, and Mercedes-Benz become glaringly blatant and lumber in gargantuan proportions that rival T Rex. One character in the film aptly states about the public's taste for entertainment, 'We want it bigger and louder...and with more teeth.' That may sum up our movie-going appetite as well. This upgraded fourth generation of dino-thrills may certainly possess two of the former descriptive terms, but it's in the latter category in which the film has no bite. Jurassic World, while still fun, is a bit toothless.",7,4,18,12 June 2015
Cold War," Love Hurts
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A beautifully made dysfunctional love story.JIM'S REVIEW: Director Pawel Pawlikowski used his own parents' love story as his inspiration for his tragic tale, Cold War. Set in 1946 Warsaw, a music teacher becomes enamored of his young talented student. (Call me a prude, but this serious lapse of judgment never becomes an issue and this Humbert and Lolita relationship shrouds this unhealthy affair throughout the film for me.)The film follows the lives of Wictor and Zula for the next 20+ years and the changing landscape of a world at war. Caught up in the politics and upheaval of Cold War Poland and the rise of Communism, these two self-centered Bohemian souls fall in love while they battle their own personal demons.The film is superbly acted by Tomasz Kot and Joanna Kulig as the two leads. Their mercurial relationship is shown episodically and the actors fill in any gaps in their characters' many mood swings and ill-advised decisions which result in many severe consequences along the bumpy road to love. All is gloriously filmed in b& w by Lukasz Zal. The stunning imagery gives the film a somber look and captures the bleakness of the period most effectively.The screenplay by Janusz Glowacki, Pioti Borkowski, and the director has some lovely dialog in its dramatic storytelling, although some clarity is lost in translation with the film's episodic structure. At times, the jumps in time frames are jarring and in need of fine tuning. Also, the characters, as written, are basically callous and too self-absorbed to really care about. Even the beginnings of their relationship may come into question by some moviegoers due to their noticeable age difference (adult vs. teenager) and ongoing destructive nature which kept them at an emotional distance from this reviewer. (I just could not justify this dance by two sexual predators, even if its powerful ending is filled with pathos and sadness. Much should be credited to the palpable chemistry by the talented Ms. Kulig and Mr. Kot and Mr. Pawlikowski's masterful direction.)Nevertheless, Cold War is a beautifully realized and well crafted love story that makes a solid case for its two doomed and very dysfunctional lovers.",8,1,3,19 February 2019
The Hangover Part II," Monkey See, Hollywood Do
","This film is not recommended.' When a monkey nibbles on a penis, it's funny in any language.' That's just an example of the typical one-liners found in The Hangover Part II, and no, this film is not funny in any language at all. ( Well, maybe in Yiddish. )This film hit the trifecta for me: I laughed a total of three times, and two of those were due to a talented imp of a monkey named Crystal. This mostly humorless sequel to the original hit comedy franchise follows its same tired formula ad nauseam. Scene for scene is so smugly similar to the series' first successful film that any moviegoer might easily get confused, except this one cranks up the raunch factor and sprinkles in more nudity and isn't remotely as funny as the 2009 version.The Hangover Part II is poorly directed by Todd Philips who was more effective with his original version. The film boasts lousy production values and one of the worst renditions of One Night in Bangkok that has ever been recorded. The writing discredit goes to five writers this time around and they shall remain nameless as to not further embarrass their family or friends, ( although the director is one of them and needs to be held accountable for his lack of finesse and management skills with the cast and crew in both areas of production. To say that he is a double threat gives new meaning to the term. ). This latest script is so disappointing and boring compared to the other film. The forerunner, at least, provided genuine laughs back then with its earlier unique premise and only had two different scribes for that surprising box office success. The same ole boys are back, with decidedly mixed results. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis as Phil, Stu, and Alan disrespectively, of course. This trio of misfits seems at odds from the start and their interactions now are mostly shrill and quite routine. Its faithful young audiences may have come to accept their roles and and expect their predictable interaction as they did before: Phil is the leading man or ringleader in charge of the shenanigans, Stu is the hapless victim, and Alan is the crazy wiseguy type providing comic relief. ( Justin Bartha as Doug is along for the ride and he again disappears before all hell breaks loose in Bangkok, the scene of the crime / wedding. ) I expected more from these talented actors. Again, they awaken from a stupor, not knowing what went on the previous night and slowly piece together the mystery while searching for the bride's missing brother. Ken Jeong also returns as the highly volatile Mr. Chow and he wears out his welcome very fast. Incidents occur that have more long lasting repercussions to the boys, yet no one seems to acknowledge that problem throughout the film. In fact, some of the results from their hangover are glossed over and quickly explained in the film's end credits. I guess it's too much work to incorporate those details into the formulaic plot.I couldn't wait for The Hangover Part II to be over. It's pretty sad when the pet monkey outshines the monkeyshines perpetrated by the film's human cast. Hopefully, what happens in Bangkok will stay there permanently. However, I can already smell the stench of the next installment being planned. I shall not be attending. GRADE: C-",3,2,5,7 June 2011
Prisoners," Daddy's Gone A-Hunting
","This film is highly recommended. Emotions always run high whenever a child is in peril. For years, the hostage drama has been a successful staple in the crime drama genre. Films dealing with child abduction have been a mixed lot, from the sublime (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone) to the good (Raising Arizona, The Changeling), from the mediocre (Ransom, Man on Fire) to the ridiculous (Taken, Labyrinth, Bunny Lake is Missing). Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners belongs in that upper echelon of superior dramas. The film begins as a standard emotional melodrama about the aftermath of a child kidnapping before veering into a gripping story of vengeance and vigilantism. This is a film where bigger issues come into play. It doesn't play safe by being just a well-meaning routine crime drama. Instead, the filmmakers would rather deal with the gut-wrenching consequences done by flawed individuals and the backlash caused by revenge and retaliation in the name of justice.Over Thanksgiving dinner, two children go missing. An investigation ensues, leading one detective to a possible suspect, a mentally challenged loner who was near the scene of the crime. But with little evidence to hold him and time running out, a father decides to intervene and takes matters into his own hands.Hugh Jackman plays that father, Keller Dover, a devout Christian, an everyman who loves and protects his family at any cost. Jackman has some dark and sadistic scenes to play and his emotional range as the conflicted dad is beyond riveting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Loki, the lead detective on the case and the actor delivers a multi-layered performance as an obsessed investigator in search of answers. Maria Bello is Keller's distraught and supportive wife, Grace. Terence Howard and Viola Davis are the other couple who are swept into this crisis and all of three actors are at the top of their game. Playing the primary suspect is Paul Dano, whose expertise in creating creepy characters comes in quite handy, along with Melissa Leo as his quirky and loyal mother.Villeneuve's direction is lean and concise. He shows some disturbing graphic imagery to incite the necessary rationale to make the audience possibly justify the acts of violence throughout the film while debating ethical questions about the brutality: When do the ends justify the means? At what price does one trade their moral conscience for justice? How far can one desperate act go to surpass another? (Warning: This is not a film for the easily squeamish or overly sensitive film-goer.)From the start, Prisoners captures the moviegoer's attention and never lets go. It is a tension- filled mystery with some surprising twists amid the moral dilemmas. The film is thoroughly engrossing due to a literate and perspective script by Aaron Guzikowski which takes its time to build characters and flesh out its plot. Add to that, some terrific acting from an outstanding ensemble, Villeneuve's solid direction, and you have one of the best films of the year. (My only reservation is a deliberately ambiguous ending that tends to mar the film's overall impact.)Prisoners works on so many varied levels: as an intense crime thriller about child abduction, an emotional melodrama about a family in crisis, or as a dark parable about the violent world we live in. See Prisoners for any of those reasons, but by all means, make sure you see this film. GRADE: B+ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9,3,6,27 September 2013
Silence," Scorsese's Preachy Sermon
","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: In the hands of master filmmaker, Martin Scorsese has made a beautifully crafted but preachy (and boring) historical drama.GRADE: C+JIM'S REVIEW: Similarities with other sources abound in Martin Scorsese's epic film, Silence. Two missionaries are sent to a foreign country to spread the word of their prophet. No, it's not Roland Joffe's The Mission, Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast, James Clavell's Shogun, or, for that matter, The Book of Mormons...although if the film has some comedy or musical numbers, it would have at least been memorably. The film is actually more akin to Apocalypse Now...as these two envoys are sent on a mission to stop a former leader who has fallen from grace. Not the Vietnam War, where thousands were brutally killed...rather the Holy War, where thousands were brutally killed. Here the battle is over religious souls in this cinematic philosophic debate of a film.Set in the 17th century, this historical drama follows two Jesuit priests, Father Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver), whose mission is to travel to Japan and rescue their former mentor, Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neesom) from renouncing his faith. As they journey to a strange land, they are met with a violent culture that will stop Christianity by any means possible and demand apostasy (the renunciation of one's religious tenets) or death to any of its worshipers. The padres cling to their faith while their flock is sadistically slaughtered in grisly detail.One cannot deny that Silence is grandiose filmmaking. Mr. Scorsese knows how to craft his tale with enough style and dramatic flourishes. One could not expect less from its great director, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jay Cocks. His images are on an epic scale and the photography by Rodrigo Prieto is just glorious to behold. But there are inherent problems with the screenplay film itself. Silence trips up on its own words. The film regurgitates scenes of torture, both psychological and physical, that weaken the overall impact and border on the excessive. Its talk-torture-talk-torture format becomes redundant.While the subject makes for fascinating viewing, the road traveled is filled with lengthy scenes with languishing pacing, underdeveloped characters, and an overuse of voice-over narration to explain the plot rather than show the emotional anguish. The spectacle is visually supreme while the dialog has a heavy-handed message that never seem genuine. There is just too much proselytizing and arguing over the word of God that it becomes superficial debates and overshadows the characters who seem more plot devices than real people. There is nothing unique about the narrative. History has already proved that many have died under the guise of religion (and will continue to do so). The film is more sermon-like than it need be. Mr. Scorsese is literally preaching to the choir, with enough fire and brimstone to last seven Sundays.Mr. Garfield is compelling as Father Sebastian. His character is such a direct Christ figure in appearance and stance. Almost too saintly to be considered human, he becomes a superhero of God. Yet the actor gives a nuanced and multi-layered performance. Mr. Neeson, in a smaller role, brings some gravitas as well. But Mr. Driver, who is an interesting presence, has little screen time and simply disappears midway through the film, which is a misstep. More problematic however is some grave miscasting in two pivotal roles: Issey Ogata as the inquisitor supplies very little menace to his role and Yôsuke Kubozuka as the weak Kichijiro becomes a form of unintentional comic relief as written. The tragic tone of this character eludes him.Silence remains a strong and passionate work by Mr. Scorsese. It is a serious work of art with a Capital S (and add a Capital B for Boring). The film is in dire need of judicious editing and major rewrites. On one hand, it relentlessly rails against the Catholic Church and its teachings while showing a reverence to its own piety. The film avoids its own silent code and tends to shout its message. tends to shout its message. There's far too much sound and fury in this well-made film when a quiet noise would have been a more powerful statement about the persecution and tyranny that befell its believers. And, I must confess, the slow and laborious pacing of this film was a personal hell for this moviegoer. No matter how wonderful this film looks, and on that count it succeeds, the film ultimately left me praying for a swift conclusion. Silence is a major disappointment from a master filmmaker. Let us pray that his energy and vision comes to a better end in his next creative venture. Can I hear an amen to that?",6,1,2,7 February 2017
Logan," The Grey Wolf Returns
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A more somber and ultra-violence ode to a comic book hero.SYNOPSIS: The Grey Wolf is back for his swan song.JIM'S REVIEW: The claws are still razor-sharp but the man behind them is worn out and losing some of his super-heroic powers in the last chapter of the Wolverine legend. Time has not dulled the pain from the many wars this lone (wolf) survivor has fought. His body is scarred, both physically and mentally. Heavy drinking is his past-time. A hero has fallen on hard times. Hugh Jackman again stars in his acclaimed title role, the third and final chapter to his Wolverine trilogy. His character has seen better days, yet he still ready for action as he takes on the villains in James Mangold's serious slice-and-dice adventure film, Logan.It is 2029 and most of the mutants are gone or undercover. Logan a.k.a. Wolverine, that Grey Wolf of a man, is now a limo driver (although being a chef at a Hibachi restaurant would have been more profitable occupation). He also has become caretaker to Prof. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who has aged less gracefully and is in the process of loses control of his mind on a regular basis. With his numerous brain seizures, the Professor has a paralyzing effect on those nearby, sort of a mental 6.9 earthquake. Still , he can see the future and tells Logan that he will meet a strong force who will change his worthless life. That person is an 11 year old feral wild child named Laura (Dafne Keen). Soon the trio is on the run from evil scientists and governmental agents.Logan is one set piece after another, all of high octane battles, most of which are photographed in quick blurry takes and loud clanging sound effects. The body count rises fairly quickly with bloodletting intensity as people are hacked up, beheaded, and impaled. This is an R-rated film due to many of its violent sequences and its non-stop profanity. (The film is definitely an adult superhero film that is inappropriate for young ones.)Yet it isn't the action that impresses. Rather, it is the skillful direction by Mr. Mangold, the fine acting, and a seriously minded-script by Scott Frank, Michael Green, and the director that is willing to have its quieter scenes build as the film develops relationships and conflicts between its characters.Mr. Jackman brings a subtly hostile demeanor to his character and his interpretation of the hero shows a man slowly coming undone in search of redemption. He is defeated and tired of life's hardships. Mr. Stewart plays his part with much empathy as a once fearless man grappling with his on-going dementia. The two actors have a convincing chemistry. Ms. Keen is a talented newcomer and she handles her mostly mute-ant part extremely well. Giving strong supporting are Eriq La Salle, Elizabeth Rodriguez, and Richard E. Grant as the evil scientist in charge of the manhunt. Stephen Merchant as Logan's albino friend, Caliban, has some fine moments, as does Boyd Holbrook as the mercenary soldier, Pierce.Logan plays like a modern day western, with more than a tip of the 10 gallon hat to George Steven's 50's classic film, Shane. The direct link to both films is well conceived but a tad heavy-handed. However, this detail shows the filmmaker's successful attempt to have more gravitas and depth added to this familiar genre.X does mark the spot in Logan. As comic book blockbusters go, this film is far from comic in its darker tone and escalating violence. The film entertains, if one can accept the brutal carnage on screen, bringing a dignified conclusion to one of the better films of Marvel factory.",8,0,3,8 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Clunk Junk
","(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: This film may be critic-proof, but it is also fun-proof.GRADE: CBelieve it or not, this is actually the 11th Marvel film about superheroes. Yes, they have taken moviegoers into the comic book cosmos, with varying results, and made their films one of the most profitable series in movie history. Reviews seem pointless as the movie is critic-proof in its popularity. Avengers: Age of Ultron is also fun-proof. ￼Now let me begin my review by admitting to a bias: I am not really enamored by superhero movies. While I do usually find them entertaining and mildly diverting, I do enjoy the CGI artistry involved. I don't follow the historical and mythological angles of these comic book heroes and their mystical powers, nor do I much comprehend their hierarchy in the superhero food chain. Just show me the money in your big budget with your CGI! On that matter, the film does not disappoint.￼Adequately directed by Joss Whedon, Avengers: Age of Ultron gathers this motley crew of crusaders together once more to rescue the world from annihilation, although our heroes do a pretty good job of destroying many metropolises and injuring countless innocent bystanders in order to save them and mankind. (Perhaps they should try a little less harder next go-round.) Once more we have Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.), too snarly and uptight this round, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) with those expandable briefs and those patented stretchy trousers, Captain America (Chris Evans) with no shirtless scene for the gay crowd to Marvel (shame!), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) looking great in head to toe leather, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) with his non-stop supply of arrows, and Thor with hammer and grimace in tow. Plus some secondary avengers are now added to the mix but just take up more screen time from the primary A-team and contribute little to the film: Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, aptly named for his speed, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff a.k.a. Scarlet Witch, who has the power of mind control but had very little control of her fluctuating Russian accent, and Paul Betthany as Vision, although I had some trouble understanding his whole superpowers and identity. It's all more of the same clang-bang-shoot-em-up from that old gang of ours. ￼The thin story, also written by Whedon, has Tony Stark a.k.a. Ironman center stage as he uses the elusive Loki specter to create an artificial intelligence, namely Ultron (wonderfully voiced by James Spader), to help him and his cronies battle the ongoing forces of evil. Of course, Tony's ideal robot buddy has other ideas and more destruction and mayhem ensues.￼The battles are plentiful, six rather long combat scenes by my count, enough to please most young fan-boys and gamers in the audience, or anyone under the age of 10. There's more screen time per battle than there is in dialog or character development, although Whedon does try to give some back-story to some characters and romantic involvement between two of the Avengers (strictly boy/girl stuff). Between the ethical debates about war and peace between Stark and Captain America, or his foe Ultron, the film really has no point of view. It just keeps moving on, with its main purpose to show oodles of badly staged combat that either highlights shaky camera-work that obscures the action and movement of the actors or it relies on slo-mo aerial ballet moments for dramatic effects. The pacing is set at either of those two extremes with little in-between.￼The film takes itself far too seriously. What made previous outings so popular and effective were the humorous asides and ironic conversations between these misfits, a factor totally missing in this film except for an amusing moment involving Thor's heavy hammer and a plummeting action sequence between Ironman and the Hulk that supplies the film's sparse laughs.Noisy and clunky, Avengers: Age of Ultron is mindlessly numbing pop entertainment that seemed more desperate to please its audience with its state-of-the art imagery that supply any logic or pleasure to any of its human characters or any moviegoer with an average IQ for that matter.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4,9,21,11 May 2015
Midsommar," No Swedish Delight
","GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Artfully made but absurd in its narrative, this psychological thriller about pagan rituals and bad romance wears one out. The Swedes should sue.JIM'S REVIEW: Ari Aster's psychological horror thriller, Midsommar, is this talented director's sophomore film, his second full-length feature, but this time, he allows his excesses to get the better of him. The director in him is still very astute and resourceful, piling on impressive surreal images and a purposeful sense of dread. However, the writer in him is in need of major guidance. His film is all set-up and no pay-off.It's deja vu, horror redux and repackaged. The director's screenplay rips off other movies from the horror genre and ends up disappointing in comparison. His previous film, Hereditary, had a similar effect, but that film was at least original and compelling. This one, relies too heavily on obvious troves from Hostel (students being maimed and tortured on a student trip), The Stepford Wives (a community that is not what it appears to be), The Village and Get Out (a community of followers with a hidden agenda), Rosemary's Baby (a coven of evil), Suspiria (another coven of evil with supernatural forces), and especially The Wicker Man (yet another coven of evil with supernatural forces and pagan rituals). Add to this rehash, lots of blood and gore and it makes for a rather unpleasant, if tension-filled, moviegoing experience.Not that all films need to be strictly entertaining and upbeat, but Mr. Asher's obsesses with slasher elements and shock value to make his point about the hazards of sustaining a dysfunctional relationship. His story involves a young couple named Christian (a less-than-subtle name) and Dani. a woman with some bouts of deep mental anguish), who are trying to salvage their romance...at least Dani is. Christian is ready to call it quits and go off on a European vacation with his buds, Mark and Josh, to a idyllic commune with their Swedish friend Pelle to attend a 90 year midsummer celebration. Christian mistakingly invites his soon-to-be ex to join them. Beware a woman scorned!This revenge fantasy clocks in at nearly two and a half hours and Mr. Aster takes his time to establish his stock characters and soak up the atmosphere. (A pre-credit prologue gives a backstory to one of the central characters, but it really is not all that necessary to the film's plot.) While suspense is a mainstay, the script is in dire need of rewrites, some judicious editing, and, most importantly, clarity. One wonders why these lambs to the slaughter are so dense that they are incapable of catching any clues to their dangerous journey from the outset. (Just looking at the artwork on the walls is more than a hint at the danger than is their destiny.) Their non-plussed reactions after a particularly grisly ritual makes no sense at all. (All book sense and no common sense, as my father would have called it.) Sex, youthful folly, and hallucinatory drugs can only justify so much for the lack of logic and the willingness to stay there.What the film has at its core is a strong performance by Florence Pugh as Dani. (The director was lucky to have that lightning strike twice, as his previous film debut had a riveting lead performance by Toni Collette as well.) Ms. Puhl takes on this emotional role with a self-assured presence. She shows her characters inherent flaws, vulnerability, and her unhinged nature. Jack Reynor as her handsome boyfriend is an interesting foil and depicts a self-centered millennial quite accurately. As his friends, William Jackson Harper, Vihelm Blomgren, and Will Poulter make the most of their underwritten roles of college intellectual. laid-back foreign graduate student, and sex-driven jock, disrespectfully.Visually, the film is a stunner. Pawel Pogorzelski's photography heightens the eerie uncertainty as he contrasts the brightly-lit countryside with the darker goings-on. (Loved the 360 degree angled road trip, aerial shots, and the fluidity and multiple movements of flora during the drug-induced sessions.) Along with Andrea Flesch's peasant tribal costumes with their intricate embroidery and Bobby Krlic's electronic folk-tinged atonal musical score, the look of the film resembles a pretty utopia that goes askew rather quickly.Mr. Aster's vision of a bizarre world keeps one's attention fixed at the atmospheric details and foregone omens, but his script that loses its way. The story becomes progressively absurd as more of the mystery is slowly revealed and the plot just leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion which caused more titters and groans than real fear and genuine scares from my movie audience.Despite all of the artistry involved, Midsommar is half baked horror. Mr. Aster's film starts off very effectively as it follows the recipe for suspense but the far-fetched story has too many overripe moments and wallows in its own pretentiousness. It's well made schlock, served piping hot. Just not to my taste.",4,13,22,10 July 2019
Elysium," Paradise Lost
","This film is mildly recommended.Elysium, the latest sci-fi thriller, purports yet another fatalistic view of our future. It's an intelligent but unexciting movie that showcases all of the elements of sci-fi genre with an undercurrent of social relevance. The film deals with more complex political issues, a subject very close to its director's mindset. Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has directed this fantasy action film with enough flash and strong imagery to disguise his overt messages about class warfare, injustice, immigration, and prejudice. It's still drips of deeper themes like apartheid, inequality, and discrimination, although the racial implications have been slightly altered to conform more to socio-economic issues. The year is 2054 and it's still them versus us, as the film depicts two different worlds and class structure. There's the luxurious resort space station called Elysium where the rich can cavort in the extravagant lifestyle with which they are accustomed and only the wealthy are the welcome 1%. In sharp contrast, there's Earth, a slum-ridden hellhole for the mere common folk.Up on Elysium, everything is running quite smoothly, with Jessica Delacourt, a high-ranking governmental official, in charge. Played by Jody Foster, Dalacourt is all evil and greed. It's a one-note role, but Foster does put a spin on this stereotype every now and then.Down on Earth, everything is a mess, with Max DeCosta, an ex-con and laborer, trying to survive. Played by Matt Damon, DeCosta is all good and courageous. It's a one note role, but Damon does put a spin on this stereotype every now and then too.Of course, both will clash as Max attempts to land on Elysium to try to make matters right, (I will not go into the details of the complex plotting, the illogical circumstances that bring Max to meet his fate, or spoil any surprises except to say that Damon looks good as the anti-hero, with or without his exoskeleton attached.)Blomkamp keeps all the action and CGI in motion, although his tendency to overuse hand- held camera-work ruins much of the physical fight sequences. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, has a strong visual point of view that elevates the melodramatic moments, of which there are many. The turn of events lack genuine suspense and the final outcome is very predictable, more the fault of the screenplay than the direction.Blomkamp's casting of the supporting characters brings mixed results, although those secondary characters are far more interesting and developed than the two lead roles. Alice Braga, Wagner Moura, and Diego Luna are fine in their roles. However, there is a major misstep in casting with Sharlo Copley as Kruger, a mercenary who tends to kill the English language more eagerly than his intended targets. The actor's overwrought performance with his thick accent and poor diction undercuts most of the menace needed for this pivotal role. As for the leads, Foster, who looks fabulous, seems to be channeling Tilda Swinton with her ice princess imitation and Damon plays Max with a minimum of success.Elysium effectively shows us a grave new world and while Bromkamp's film is a thought- provoking fantasy, the film ultimately made me think about nirvana and other more heavenly travel destinations, like exiting the theater.

Selma," The Fifty Four Mile Journey
","This film is highly recommended.Selma is a great film. It centers on that fateful symbolic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, back in 1965, and tells the back-story of its coming to be. We follow Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's dream of equal rights for all, amid the sacrifices, bloodshed, and death to many of those heroic protesters. Selma is a history lesson, but one told with clarity and compassion. (There have been some complains about historical accuracy, objections to President Johnson's hesitant involvement in bringing about the Voting Act of 1965 to end racism. This argument seem to be invalid as the film shows both Johnson and King being politicians foremost, both leaders a product of their times, caught in the quagmire of hatred and conformity. The film never pretends to be a documentary; it is a docudrama, a powerful one, with archival footage and factual documentation that uphold the times accurately.)Ava DuVernay directs the film with an assured hand and an artistic vision that keeps the film riveting and emotionally grounded. There are some moments where the film gets caught up in the sanctimonious speeches and too much moralizing, but the poetic words in Paul Webb's literate screenplay make the film epic in scope and the director's visual images send home King's compelling message. DuVernay builds tension very efficiently, particularly in the clash between protesters and police. There are scenes of sudden violence that are never gratuitous (a bombing of a church, beating of innocent demonstrators, etc.) and are handled with poignancy and humanity. Making the film resonant is the central performance by British actor David Oyelowo as the pastor King. He downplays the role beautifully, showing King as a flawed but passionate person, a common man thrust into the spotlight as a national crusader for civil rights. Oyellowo captures King's spirited line delivery as a persuasive orator and has many fine subtle moments as a caring husband. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King give ample support, showing her characters loyalty and inner strength. Their moments together bring about the personal story of this married couples' dependence on each other. The film is so well cast in most of the supporting roles, with special mentions going to Corey Reynolds, Stephan James, Tim Roth, Alessandro Nivola, and especially Tom Wilkinson as a foul-mouthed and savvy L.B.J.Selma takes its audience on the long harrowing journey for equality with such reverence and restraint. There are a few minor missteps along the way as the film does lose some of its its footing in reality when it uses famous actors like Oprah Winfrey, Martin Sheen and Dylan Baker, all impersonating real life figures, rather than using lesser known thespians for those roles, or when the film tries to connect the non-violent actions of Dr. King and his followers with the recent protests that led to escalating violence (as in the closing scenes with the song, Glory, mentions of the recent Ferguson unrest.) That said, Selma is a glorious undertaking that documents a historic time when a nation finally looked at the horror perpetrated on a minority and finally found its soul.

The Artist," The Artist: When Actions Speak Louder than Words
","This film is highly recommended.' Dreams can come true again, When ev'ry thing old is new again. ' <ul><li>Lyrics by Peter Allen </li></ul>Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is a fine homage to the heydays of early cinema. It is 1927 and the arrival of 'talkies' is about to change the silent film industry and those who are unable to transition to this new process. One of those soon-to-be victims is Hollywood movie star George Valentin ( Jean Dujardin ). A top matinée idol ( ala the real John Gilbert ) accustomed to fame and the fortune or misfortune it brings, Valentin meets cute an adoring fan named Peppy ( Bérénice Bejo ). Soon Peppy becomes a rising ingénue on the road to stardom while his life begins to descend into alcohol and poverty. Yes, the plot is mighty familiar, but bear with it. With the film being basically silent, the overall visual look of the film must greatly compensate for the lack of words and dialog. And that is just what happens in this marvelous film, as it captivates and transports the moviegoer back to a more innocent time.The Artist is a rather conventional mash-up of Singin' in the Rain with A Star is Born. Yet it completely won me over with its masterful direction and period details. ( I realized this about 20 minutes into the film during one terrific dream sequence where sound effects abruptly broke the 'silence' barrier. ) Shooting the film in 1.33:1 ratio and in glorious black & white, just as those silent films were initially seen, is more than a mere gimmick in Hazanavicius' vision. He takes his appreciation of his film subject seriously and adds his modern spin to this film while staying entrenched in that revered cinematic style.The film is done mostly without dialog, albeit title cards playing a significant role as does a continuous musical soundtrack that highlights the action on the screen. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, tends to borrow too heavily from some musical choices (as with Hermann's Vertigo score ) and some film masterworks ( like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, The Mark of Zorro with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, loyal chauffeur and all. Some may say these touches are only inspired from other sources, others might question the film's lack of originality. )But the film has certified moments of pure genius intermixed with scenes of high melodrama. There are scenes of such wit and charm ( a musical dance number remindful of that of Astaire and Rogers ; a slightly surreal moment with a young starlet embracing a coat-rack that seems to come to life; a dinner table scene that owes much to passage of time tableaux from the aforementioned Kane, etc. ) that dazzles the movie audience. ( At the film's end, there was spontaneous applause heard throughout the theater. )Another plus to the film's winning demeanor is the central casting of the two main actors. Dujardin plays Valentin as a proud and vain peacock of a man. He can emote like the silent film stars of yesteryear, brandishing his handsomeness and profile to extremes and the next moment bringing a Chaplinesque quality to the more vulnerable side of this man's personality. Bérénice Bejo radiates that sunny and 'peppy' quality needed for her character to become fully realized. Her loving and caring nature provides the essence for romance within the story. ( Special mention goes to Uggie the Dog for proving once again that we humans can be so easily upstaged by our four-legged friends.)The Artist is an affectionate love letter to the silent film era and Hollywood itself. As the old adage says, 'Silence is golden.' And so is this delightful film. GRADE: B+NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",9,3,4,12 January 2012
La La Land," Let The Music Play
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An enchanting modern day love story set to music.GRADE: A-SYNOPSIS: Set in modern day LA, two dreamers sing, dance, and fall in love.JIM'S REVIEW: Who says they don't make movies like they use to? Damien Chazelle's La La Land restores one's fate in the creative process and modern day filmmaking. A daring and thrilling project, the film is a simple boy meets girl tale, set in Tinseltown, that harks back to the kind of musical that MGM would churn out regularly in days of yore. This homage to the old Hollywood musical is simply a class act all the way. (And boy, do we need it now!)They meet cute, these star-crossed lovers, caught in a traffic jam, one that begins our story with such skill and exuberance. This unexpected opening dance number efficiently sets the right tone for the film mixing realism with musical fantasy. (Special kudos to Mandy Moore's spellbinding choreography. Her opening number, Another Day of Sun, is a stunner and the camera angles swoop and spin with such fluidity, as do the dancers. Jacques Demy's The Young Girls from Rochefort is its direct inspiration...and there will be other musical salutes throughout the film.)Of course, we know the two will eventually get together against all odds, singing their way into your heart. Mia (Emma Stone), an out-of-work actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist, have destiny guiding their every move (and fortunately Mr. Chazelle doing the same).The songs by Justin Hurwitz and lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are clever, moving, and highly memorable. They bring with them the necessary range of emotion that advance the plot so effortlessly: bittersweet moments, love and heartbreak, dreamy romance. (The haunting love theme, City of Stars, and Ms. Stone's 11 o'clock number, The Audition (The Fools Who Dream), are two unforgettable highlights, as is the closing number, a pastiche that tips its hat to such films as An American in Paris, Casablanca, Roman Holiday, and Singin' in the Rain. Yes, this is a movie that will cause one to swoon.The screenplay, also by Mr. Chazelle, takes our two lovers on a journey that confronts life's on- going question about love, relationships, and art. It literally sweeps you off your feet and send you into space with a sense of giddy nostalgia and joyous surprise. Yes, the plot is paper thin. Some of the musical numbers seem forced and do not blend with the reality surrounding our lovers. Yet, the overall effect is still captivating.The core to the movies' success or failure is firmly in control due to the performances of the two lead actors. Both Ms. Stone and Mr. Gosling have shown that they have a strong chemistry together in other films, but here, it is so crucial to the film that we buy into their romance. (Some may not. I did totally. Call me a romantic.) While Ms. Stone's and Mr. Gosling's musical talents are limited and rarely come near the superior footwork of Astaire, Rogers, Charisse, or Kelly, the two actors are more than competent and quite charming in their roles. They compensate with their strong dramatic acting choices that impress and emotionally involve the movie-going audience.Mr. Chazelle stages his scenes with flair and style. He transitions from dramatic scenes into musical numbers with ease. The physical production dazzles with its Technicolor dreamscape of pulsating candy-colored hues. Linus Sandren's cinematography is gorgeous and the production design by David Waco uses the old time movie sets to create the artificial world of movie musicals. (I particularly loved A Lovely Night, a tribute to the Dancing in the Dark sequence from The Bandwagon, complete with lamppost.)La La Land honors the lavish Hollywood musicals of the past, those rare breed of movies that became extinct as moviegoers' tastes changed. Let us hope this film brings about a renaissance of sorts. La La Land is a film about love and made with love. It is a exhilarating cinematic experience not to be missed!",9,2,6,27 December 2016
Super 8," Super 8 - Not That Great
","This film is recommended. The film's title is a slight misnomer. Super 8 isn't super entertainment, but it is an enjoyable diversion. It does however have a compendium of, at least, 8 films in this one giant sci-fi kiddie adventure movie: ( In alphabetical order, Alien, The Fugitive, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., The Goonies, Jurassic Park, Stand by Me, and War of the Worlds all quickly come to mind. ) Certain scenes in Super 8 pay direct homage ( or simply rip-off ) those original sources and many others, I'm sure.The film is so unoriginal and derivative. It's the summer of 1979. We know this by the nostalgic twinge of those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summers past with its hints of Walkmans, garish fashions, and unending pop oldies soundtrack. A group of teenagers are obsessed with making a zombie film with cheap but gory special effects on an Ed Wood budget. They have written, acted, and are filming their movie one night when an unexpected train crash ( the real film's most impressive big budget item ) halts their filming. Barely escaping injury, the Scooby-doo like gang soon realizes that strange occurrences are at work and they have witnessed the source of the town's problem. They also have the proof in the filmed footage from that eventful evening. The military immediately arrives and starts to cover-up the incident, but our intrepid youngsters will still try to save the town.The success of Super 8 rests on the small shoulders of its talented young actors who save the film from its sense of familiarity with their likable screen personas. The two young leads are especially strong: Joel Courtney plays Joe, a sad boy whose mother has passed away and whose deputy father is still grieving, and Elle Fanning is Alice, a pretty young thing who can't relate to her drunken father. Both Courtney and Fanning have a wonderful chemistry on screen. Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee and Zach Mills round out the rest of the team.Of course, the adults in the film are displayed as mere pawns and have no real personalities or any distinguishing traits. It is only the children that show any dimension, courage, or depth of character. The film's plot devices are simplistic and somewhat flawed, especially the investigation scene at the junior high school. The fact that these kids are never killed or severely injured with all the explosions and mayhem around them defies logic but keeps the film's PG-13 rating intact. Yet the film remains engrossing due to the solid direction of J. J. Abrams, although his script lacks any real complexity. Abrams knows how to set up his action sequences and really builds tension with his use of sound effects and concise editing techniques. The creature is rarely seen until the last third of the film (ala Jaws and Cloverfield ) and that element of surprise works very well, although it is a bit of a letdown when the creature is finally seen.Super 8 is still a fun time to be had, but just realize that it's nothing more or less than a well crafted children's movie masquerading as a grown-up thriller.

Snowden," Snow Job
","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A slightly disappointing character study that suffers from  conventional storytelling.  GRADE: C+  SYNOPSIS: The life of Edward Snowden.   Oliver Stone has always been an audacious and exciting filmmaker. He  uses his anger about certain causes as his inspiration. Even when his  narrative becomes sanctimonious and convoluted, his visual flair and  kinetic style compensates for his grandstanding on political issues.  His films carry his unique vision along with his political message that  energizes his craft. His excesses hide a multitude of flaws in his  storytelling. Such is the case with his latest venture, Snowden.  The subject is controversial from the start. Villain or hero? Spy or  whistle-blower? Egotist or crusader? Traitor or patriot? Whatever your  viewpoint, be it liberal or conservative, his story remains a good  mystery to tell. Of course, Mr. Stone takes the latter road to travel,  painting this young computer geek as a saintly moral person caught  between governmental conspiracies and cover-ups. Snowden follows the  prototype of many of Stone's antiheroes from his other films. a common  man riling up against the establishment. Big Brother conspiracy  theories and paranoia abound.  He structures the film as a flashback, from 2013 with Laura Poitras'  documentary, Citizenfour, as the starting point (a good plot device)  before going back to 2004 with Edward Snowden as a ill-equipped recruit  with an overabundance of patriotic vigor who loves America and believes  wholeheartedly in its conservative values. Then a brief stint with the  CIA and on to a productive life as a National Security Agency lackey,  always with that same pro-American sentiment. This attitude will, of  course, change as he becomes corrupted by the system.  The problem with this film is a preachy script that simplified its  complex subject to the point of tedium. The film bores rather than  excites. The film's ongoing motif, that Big-Brother-is- watching theme,  is completely overstated, so evident in a scene of 1984 hysteria  involving a large over-sized head spouting hateful rhetoric to a small  insignificant Snowden figure.   For the most part, Mr. Stone's vision is straightforward, making his  title character a candidate for canonization from the onset rather than  show any of Snowden's human flaws. His Snowden is a shy introverted  idealist who becomes jaded with the military machine and with the  governmental agencies as his employer. The screenplay, by the director  and Kieran Fitzgerald, plays it too safe and politicizes its already  political character as a mere pawn. It is in need of some major  re-writing.  One of the director's initial missteps is trying to span nearly ten  years of Snowden's life instead of focusing on his more interesting  later years prior to his criminal act, or his whistle-blowing,  depending one your own viewpoint. It comes off as a Readers' Digest  abridged version. Granted, Mr. Stone honestly acknowledges that this  film is a dramatization, even if it is based on facts, but the drama is  seriously missing, placing the solemn seriousness front and center.  The other gaffe is putting the real Edward Snowden in the film's  conclusion, creating a jarring reaction that mixes fiction and reality  with an aftertaste that smacks of pure propaganda. Throughout the film,  Mr. Stone lays all of the blame on the American government's illegal  surveillance tactics upon its citizens and none of the irresponsibility  with Snowden's covert espionage actions and its possible repercussions  to its agents. This send the film into Crazyville mode, especially  hearing the real Snowden expounding scripted words in his own defense.  Except for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is quite compelling as Snowden,  and a fine performance by an unrecognizable Rhys Ifans, all the other  roles are sketchy and not well developed. Especially lacking any depth  is the romantic relationship with Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsey Mills,  which should be the central emotional connection with the movie-going  audience. Shailene Woodley tries to add some nuance to her  under-written character, but again the screenplay lets her and the  other actors down.  Snowden is a well-crafted film, nicely filmed by cinematographer  Anthony Dod Mantle. The film is a visual treat. Oliver Stone cannot  make anything that looks remotely inferior. He is a master showman,  always was and always will be. But his wobbly narrative, of which he is  partially to blame, cannot keep up with his strong images. Sadly,  Snowden becomes the ultimate snow job.   NOTE: Don't miss the end credits. They are the most focused and  powerful part of the film with Peter Gabriel's lovely original song,  The Veil, scored with wonderful archival footage and graphics concisely  edited to maximum effect.",6,2,13,18 September 2016
Woman in Gold," All That Glitters...
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4) This film is mildly recommended.In brief: No Midas touch...a serious-minded film that only scratches the surface of its important subject.GRADE: B-It seems standard practice nowadays that whenever a film is touted 'based on true events', it is far from true. Upon researching this biography of Adele Bloch-Bauer and her family, that much is true. The gold standard has been slightly devalued in this noble effort that tells its 'true' story in the most melodramatic of ways. Woman in Gold simplifies an important issue (the ethical matter of stolen art during the Nazi reign) and tries to personalize this historic event with stick figures as its characters and the wobbliest of story as its source. While it certainly is engrossing fare, it's a foolhardy result. ￼Set in Vienna, the film centers on Klimt's masterwork, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I. Once owned by the family and taken away from this Jewish clan and now the property of the Viennese government, the painting is now the treasure in question. A legal fight ensues. In one corner stands our worthy contender, 'Saint' Maria Altman (Helen Mirren), who if we are to believe, wants this artwork back in her possession for strictly personal reasons as the painting depicts her dearly beloved grandmother. Taking her case is a young idealistic lawyer, Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds). In the other corner are those nasty governmental bureaucrats who want to keep the work of art for its people as a symbol of patriotism and national pride. And the financial worth of the piece sure doesn't hurt either. ￼The painting becomes the MacGuffin in this film that brings on the conflict and unites both parties in their battle over ownership. Alexi Kaye Campbell's misbegotten screenplay sees the issue in only black and white terms, with its stilted arguments and painted in the broadest of brush-strokes that never resemble anything remotely realistic. There is no balance in this weighty matter with all sympathies going to our stoic heroine from the outset.Adequately directed by Simon Curtis, the film carries its self-importance as its main pedigree. Adele is a feisty and strong-willed character, a predictable combination for the crowd- pleasing audience to root for and Dame Helen energizes the proceeding with her finely nuanced portrayal of a woman determined to fight injustice. But the film's lack of reality is the real crime in question. (Granted the tale spans decades, yet it should still adhere to the facts more closely...which it does not.) Mr. Reynolds is miscast in the crusader role, part nebbish and part idealistic hero as written, although the actor is never that convincing in the latter. Also in the cast are Daniel Bruhl as Hubertus Czernin, an ally to the cause, Tatiana Maslany as the younger Adele, Max Irons as her husband, and Henry Goodman as her father (in flashbacks), all contributing greatly to their underdeveloped characters. More support is given by Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Pryce, and Katie Holmes as Pam, all talent wasted.Woman in Gold is a riveting tale. The subject matter alone is compelling, but it remains pure fool's gold in its filmmaking efforts. See this docudrama for the glowing Ms. Mirren and the glorious artwork on display. They're priceless.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,6,11,23 April 2015
The King," Slow but Rewarding Retelling of Henry V Legend
","GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A powerful battle scene and Timothée Chalamet's fine performance does not an epic make.JIM'S REVIEW: It isn't easy being king, especially if you don't want the job. But duty calls, and Henry, Prince of Wales, or Hal to his friends, must fulfill his destiny in David Michôd's historical drama, The King. The film is given the royal treatment with good production design, panoramic vistas, and lavish period costumes, with special mention to Nicholas Britell's elegant music score which elevates the film's pedigree to nearly epic stature. Yet, despite all of the filmmakers' noble quest for accuracy, the final result is a bit of a prodding melodrama lacking a strong narrative, compelling characters, and any real excitement.Timothée Chalamet has the title role as the unlikely king and this young and talented actor adds another thoughtful and convincing portrayal to his fine repertoire. As his loyal friend and mentor Falstaff, Joel Edgerton plays his character with no humor and a far too serious edginess but Sean Harris has some nice moments as the scheming William Gascoigne. Robert Pattinson is Hal's chief nemesis, the Dauphin of France, and he entertains in his few scenes, but his borderline campy buffoonish interpretation and thick French accent just does not gel with the serious trappings and undercuts the conflict and the character's needed menacing nature.Still, Mr. Michôd directs with authority and he crafts his film with much flourish. But his screenplay, coauthored by Mr. Edgerton, gets bogged down in too much historical details, politics, and court intrigue while failing to establish well-drawn characters and interesting dialog. Everyone talks in dry expositional conversations with no genuine emotional heft. Everyone pouts and stares. Everyone broods excessively. But then, is anyone ever happy in the 15th century?As the battle lines are drawn between King Henry V of England and King Charles IV of France, the film starts to build some interest, especially in its very well-staged mud-soaked action sequence of The Battle of Agincourt, but this overall thrilling effect comes a little too late.(And let's face it, Mr. Chalamet's rousing pep-talk on the battlefield, sans Shakespeare's prose, pales by comparison.)The King strives for greatness but settles for conventional storytelling with just a tinge of mediocrity.",7,2,5,3 November 2019
Love & Mercy," Beached Boy
","(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: With all its fits and starts, Love &Mercy rarely takes off.GRADE: B- Any biopic has the distinct purpose of showcasing its source and the unfathomable obstacles that made this person so significant in our lives. Most are formulaic, based on some factual information with much conjecture, and sentimental manipulative efforts (a bad childhood, a special talent, the highs and lows of a substantial career, etc.) while some, actually very few, are able to be an honest and moving testament to that human being. Love & Mercy, the story of Brian Wilson on Beach Boy fame, does many things right, but it is still standard storytelling that boast a strong performance from one of its actors playing this tortured musician. ￼Yes, one of the actors. There are two actors cast to play Brian Wilson: Paul Dano depicting Brian (Past) as the tortured musical genius and John Cusack is Brian (Future) in his more depressed and sadder mental condition in later years. This idea, of using two physically different people to inhabit one man, may seem a bit daring and creative to many (although the same device was used to ill effect in Bob Dylan's 2007 film biography, I'm Not There, coincidentally written by that same screenwriter, Oren Moverman, with help from Michael Alan Lerner ), but the final result is more foolhardy than inspiring. Director Bill Pohlad is only partly successful with this film. He overdoes the artsy self- conscious camera movement and jumpy editing techniques. It's hard to pinpoint the real problem, if the cause lies squarely with the director, the two actors impersonating one man concept, or a very conventional script that rarely shows any depth of character as it freely bounces from Brian to Brian in full AAHD mode. The moviegoer is never allowed to settle into one storyline, past or future, long enough before thrown into another scene due to the film's time-traveling format. ￼ This casting stunt is jarring. Dano is just fine as the young Wilson. He captures the recklessness and euphoria of a creative artist gaining notoriety and plagued with self-doubt. The actor makes subtle choices to show the madness settling in while his obsessive musical talent pulls him further from reality. Mr. Dano even resembles Wilson which helps, but he never resembles John Cusack, which doesn't. Granted, Cusack has the more difficult role showing a man over-medicated and in a zombie-like existence, dealing with his mental illness and emotional anguish, but he doesn't resemble Dano or Wilson in the least. There is no physical connection, no vocal similarities or mannerisms between the two actors. Cusack never finds the nuance of his character. Some of his scenes work very effectively, most do not, due to the actor's inability to fade into his role. Dano succeeds most effectively.There is also a wonderful supporting performance by Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's love interest which helps the film immensely and an odd one-dimensional one delivered by the usually reliable Paul Giamatti as Wilson's duplicitous manager and caretaker, Dr. Eugene Landy. Perhaps his wig proved too clownish for the actor to focus on his craft. (I know I had trouble focusing.) Also doing credible work are Bill Camp as Wilson's abusive father and Jake Abel as Mike Love.￼The film has enough interesting moments that shine in this bi-polar movie, particularly when Pohlad deftly handles the behind-the-scenes studio sessions of Good Vibrations and Pet Sounds. One wishes there were more attention and screen time paid for these and other musical interludes rather that the short musical snippets and hurried melodrama we are given, not to mention an ending that ties up all its loose ends with title cards explaining the fate of its characters (another example of sloppy writing). Special mention goes out to the sound mixing by Eugene Gearty which truly enhances the film, as does Atticus Ross' musical scoring.￼God Only Knows, with Dano solely playing Wilson, further rewrites, and a more linear structured story, Love & Mercy could have really worked. And Wouldn't That Be Nice.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,2,4,19 June 2015
Don't Breathe," Three Blind Mice
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A nifty little thriller that relies on suspense rather than  gore.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: Three thugs decide to rob a home with unexpected results.   JIM'S REVIEW: Let me begin my review by sharing one of my favorite  movie-going experiences. As a child, we were visiting all the tourist  sights of New York City. That afternoon, we were hustled to our seats  at the cavernous Art Deco beauty known as Radio City Music Hall to see  the Rockettes and their musical extravaganza, to be followed by a movie  called Wait Until Dark. The thriller, about a group of robbers  terrorizing a blind Audrey Hepburn was riveting to me. And during a  climactic battle of wits between the defenseless victim and her  stalker, the entire community of moviegoers gave out a loud primal  scream, levitated from their seats, and then laughed at their own  reactions. Like a well choreographed flash mob scene before its time,  but totally unplanned. Wonderful, I thought, this is what movies can  do!  Which brings me to the film, Don't Breathe, which follows almost the  exact same formula and plot. Not to the same desired effect, but still  impressive by today's standards. The cat vs. mouse set-up is part of a  time-worn tradition in a game-turning series of events. Strategically  staged and with a hell-bent slyness, the film has more bumps in the  night than most usual horror thrillers. This is due to the skills of  its director, Fede Alvarez. With this being only his second film that  he directed (the first being an awful remake of Evil Dead), Mr. Alvarez  is a talent to watch. Vastly superior to his first venture where he  seemed more obsessed with the grisly blood factor, this film is not as  graphically violent as that first film (which detracted from the  suspense). With this film, he is more restrained and in control as a  director. The shock factor is still there, but handled with more  finesse (except for a short detour into sexual abuse that is crass and  disturbing).  The premise is simple, more an outline than a story: Three thugs decide  to rob a home with unexpected results. The trio includes Alex (Dylan  Minette), a sensitive love-sick delinquent, Rocky (a fine Jane Levy), a  desperate and savvy partner wanting to escape from her abusive and  poverty-ridden lifestyle, and Money (Daniel Zovatto), a psychopath.  Their victim is supposed to be the owner of the house, a blind  ex-soldier who is nameless in the film. Effectively played by Stephen  Lang, the stage is ready for twists and turns...perhaps too many, as it  wears out its welcome with an overindulgence of multiple endings and  strained confrontations that become contrived and threaten to impact on  the film's credibility as the predators instantly become prey.  Still Don't Breathe generates maximum tension with a minimum of  modern-day gore, just enough which should suffice its Generation Z  audience. The script, by the director and his writing partner, Rodo  Sayagues, is formulaic and predictable, but it successfully maintains  suspense and provides the thrills. Going in to this genre of movies you  get what you expect, but there is some wit and cleverness in the film's  visuals, particularly in a 'lights-out segment' that is downright  creepy and excitingly filmed by Pedro Luque .  With the spooky sleeper hit, Don't Breathe, the tension builds in a  logical and slightly claustrophobic way, as Mr. Alvarez and his cast  notches up the suspense ratio in a nifty little thriller that delivers  more goosebumps headed in your direction. So sit back and try to relax.",8,4,10,6 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," In Search of the Real Beauty
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A second-hand knock-off that rarely touches the original's beauty but still entertains.JIM'S REVIEW: The Hollywood Remake. A strange breed of movie it is. It is not a sequel adding more to an already told tale. It's more like a parasite leeching onto someone else's ideas and crediting themselves with all of the glory. Those who loved the original will look upon this new attempt with disdain, those who disliked the predecessor will question the filmmaker's motives. Is it pure folly or a creative need to improve upon the mistakes of others? Most recent remakes seem to be financial quests for more $$$, cashing in on the known product and its glowing reputation. Whatever the reason, all are hoping the film will be rediscovered by a new audience and make a profitable return.Which brings us to the latest entry, Disney's Beauty and the Beast (2017). Now the studio has pulled from its vaults one of the most honored movies of all times, a near-perfect masterwork and the only animated film ever to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. (Perhaps we should drop to our knees and give thanks that they do not own the rights to Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, Some Like It Hot, or many other film classics.) Beauty and the Beast (1991) has such a high pedigree and creates a daunting challenge to covert into a live action remake, even with all of the CGI state-of-the-art technology and artisans on board for this project.Which leaves us to wonder: Can one ever perfect the already perfect...Is there room for improvement upon such a skillful work of art? Director Bill Condon was at the helm of this project and the answer to his end result is decidedly a mixed blessing.Let me begin by saying that is much to admire in this re-imagining. Yet for every step forward, the film awkwardly takes two steps back: the nice mix of live action and CGI is more than serviceable yet hardly magical, the ensemble is well cast with some notable exceptions, production values are generally strong although proportions of the re-animated animated objects are inconsistent and vary in size from one scene to the next, and the glorious score by the talented team of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman remains relatively intact, with some additional new tunes added which do little to impress. (Except for one standard Broadway 11 o'clock number, Evermore, the additional tunes with lyrics by Tim Rice, are lackluster.)Also, on the minus side: Backstories have been written for some of the characters, but they serve more as filler and do little to advance the plot. The screenplay by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spilotopoulos has the basic plot handled successfully, but too many sub-plots muck up the works. The dialog has an overabundance of anachronisms than become almost as jarring in their dated pop culture references as Josh Gad's odd interpretation in the role of a minor sidekick character, La Fou, which becomes a major misstep in such a sweet story. The actor chooses to perpetuate the gay effeminate stereotype in his overt 'nance' mannerisms that is humorless and borderline offensive. He almost ruins the film as he takes this fairy tale far too literally and figuratively, as does Bill Condon's direction. His direction seems haphazard and in need of restraint. Mr. Condon often goes for the obvious slapstick and crass moments rather than enhancing the subtle charm and class of this classic love story. No more is this apparent than in his treatment of the film's big production number, Be Our Guest. (In the original animated version, the film is aglow with vibrant colors and stunning hand-drawn details that make for a delightful movie-going experience. Here, the moment is excessive, becoming a dizzying whirl of garish shapes and hyper-active movement that blurs the details of its imagery. Other musical sequences lack proper staging with scenes that overwhelm the proceedings. However, Mr. Condon does get the essential title number right in both setting a romantic mood and filling the screen with sumptuous detailing.Some of the actors are spot-on, while other are just spotty. Emma Watson as Belle, is fine in her acting, but her singing is wispy and thin. (Paging Marni Nixon!) Ms. Watson does share a lovely chemistry with Dan Steven's Beast and the actor is very convincing in his angst under layers of make-up and special effects. Kevin Kline as Belle's father is a treat as is Luke Evans, playing a leaner and meaner Gaston. He captures the menace and vanity of this perfect foil. More voice-overs than real supporting turns are provided by Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McKellen, while Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Stanley Lucci, and Audra McDonald try to bring some degree of interest into their fussy characterizations. And let's not even discuss the mincing of the aforementioned Mr. Gads any further...awful.That said, Beauty and the Beast (2017) still entertains and is a lovely diversion in its tale of unconditional love. The celebrated music score is a lovely homage to the Broadway musicals of yore and its romantic story still enchants. I suppose, if one has never seen the superior 1991 film, I'm sure that what is on screen is all the more captivating.Russia said, 'Nyet' to this remake due to censorship issues with homophobia. I said, 'Meh' to this remake due to purely aesthetic reasons. This film, while no beast, is certainly no beauty either. Rent, or better yet, buy the original animated version and bask in its rare beauty. Sometimes tales as old as time really are...to say the least.",7,0,4,20 March 2017
Sicario," Taking Aim at the Drug Wars
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: Another story about the drug wars that gives us more of the same but with style GRADE: B-Sicario means hit-man. That is all you need to know to understand the underlying theme in this thriller about the drug wars. There will be much blood, carnage, revenge, and savagery. That is part of the territory in this crime genre and Sicario follows that proved formula and rarely strays off course. That is both its strength and its weakness. The literate screenplay by Taylor Sheridan shows the gritty and grisly side of the Mexican cartel and its ongoing success in illegal drug trafficking.￼We follow an idealistic F.B.I. recruit, Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), as she undertakes an new assignment, meeting unsavory characters and slowly learning the corrupt system that is in place in this drug-infested borderland area between the USA and Mexico. In her baptism under fire, she partners with two old pros: Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a gruff but knowledgeable government agent in charge of the operation, and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a tough and intense policeman with many secrets and demons. The three actors are fine in their roles and make their characters very believable. Adding strong support are Daniel Kaluuya as Kate's partner and Jon Bernthal as Ted, a one-night stand.￼This is standard but effective storytelling. Nothing much surprises here plot-wise, but director Denis Villeneuve adds many nice visuals to this conventional tale. (The talented Roger Deakin's cinematography helps immensely.) The film's chief asset is the director's skill in contrasting the common lives of the Mexican people and their nonchalant attitude about the crime and violence that infects their everyday existence in the subtlest of ways. He doesn't shy away from the horror of decaying corpses or bloodied victims caught in the crossfires of the drug wars, sometimes lingering too long at the grotesque images he creates.￼Sicario takes us to an ugly and depressing world but it is not to every moviegoer's taste. While most of it is often predictable and unoriginal, the film remains interesting and compelling. Still, Villeneuve's technical expertise takes direct aim of its difficult subject and allows Sicario to hit the target at very close range more often than not.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,1,3,28 October 2015
Les Misérables," Don't Miz Les Miz
","This film is highly recommended.Strange how our senses compensate for us. Sight can balance sound in mere seconds. ( A prime example: In the 60's, the winning candidate of the Nixon / Kennedy debates was considered a toss-up depending on your media choice of either radio versus television as your direct means of communication.)  Which brings me to the film adaptation of the musical, Les Misérables, which is a toss-up for me also.  This film adaptation remains very faithful to the theatrical show, but there are some missteps on its journey from stage to screen. Yet the film works very well and is effectively moving, just not as strong as the live stage performance.Before I go any further, I should state that Les Miz is one of my all-time favorite theatrical experiences.  Both the London and Broadway casts blended their powerful voices and harmonies to full emotional impact. Prior to seeing the film, I listened to the recording of Tom Hooper's film and found the singing to pall by comparison. The voices seemed raw and overworked, never hitting those high notes one expects from its complex score. In fact, the film tends to continually sacrifice the lyrical music score and soaring voices in favor of the melodramatics of the plot. But add the director's striking visuals into the mix which emphasize more of the dramatic elements of the Hugo novel, and the vocal effect are emotionally heightened too.Hooper's choices in using non-singers in major roles with a mix of professionally trained musical performers from the stage and his approach to encourage live singing to the standard prerecorded variety has mixed results, depending on the individual actor's vocal limitations. ( The 'high notes': Possible Oscar nominees Hugh Jackman as the heroic Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway as the ill-fated Fantine, a terrific Eddie Redmayne as the lovelorn Marius. This trio of actors meld their acting and singing seamlessly. Also giving strong support are Samantha Barks as languishing Éponine, and Aaron Tveit as the rebellious Enjoiras. The low achievers: a miscast Russell Crowe as Javert and Amanda Seyfried as a bland Cosette. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, never convey the right comic tone as the Thénardiers and fall somewhere in between. )And while we are on the subject of highs and lows: It's true that one wants Les Miz to have the epic sweep of Victor Hugo's novel. However, the director literally sweeps the moviegoer into its spectacle with kinetic photography that annoys more that impresses. The film's movement never stops as the frenzied camera-work soars, pivots, and dives like a crazed bird of prey, zooming in on the actors as its hapless victims. ( All of this endless motion was all too reminiscent of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, another stylish musical with French connections. Why, there even is a leftover elephant prop on display! ) With one too many close-ups, I began to worry that this film version of Les Miz could easily become Les Diz.But fortunately, the strengths outweigh the flaws. The film has top notch production values, letting the gritty realism show the ugliness and inequitable class hierarchy of 19th century Paris. Poverty and hardship are more pronounced in this version, although the film still has its romanticized operatic elements in place and that lovely score by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boubil to envelop any moviegoer.Les Misérables remains a powerful piece of filmmaking. The devotion and passion to its source and the sensitive handling by all those involved should be commended. The film serves as a living testament to the art of the movie musical, a slowly dying genre that one hopes is finally resurrected by this exciting and riveting film experience. ( May I also caution moviegoers to bring some tissues. )So with apologies to the talented team of Schönberg and Boubil , I would like to end my film review of Les Miz with some revised lyrics, inspired by their song, I Dreamed a Dream:There was a time in Hollywood / When stars' voices would soar / And musicals were exciting / There was a time we understood / That films had dance and song / And the songs were inviting / There was a time / Then it all went wrong.I saw Les Miz and wondered why / Directors try / But fail to redo / Those stage successes often die / From stage to screen, one must still be true / Hooper's film can spin unsteady / His camera moves, it's never still / Some cast members seem unready / For their big close-up, Mr. DeMille! /But Hugh Jackman acts the part / As Valjean, his strength does tower / Dramatic, moving, from the start / Though his rich baritone needs more power. /Hathaway's so frail c'est magnifique / She owns the despair, life's rejection / Vocally strong, so tragique / Her Fantine is sheer perfection. /Barks and Redmayne remain thrilling / Dubbing others could have hid some flaws / Like Seyfried's sharp high-pitched trilling / And Crowe's low and raspy caws. /The film's production is detailed / Its score's romantic and lyrical / Les Miz does work where others failed / Le grand musical miracle.GRADE: B+Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9,7,13,2 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guarded
","(RATINGS: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Not nearly as much fun as its predecessor, this film still entertains.SYNOPSIS: That dysfunctional band of lovable space fighters as they solve one problem only to uncover another.JIM'S REVIEW: There is a scene in the new chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 which has the right flippant tone that most of the film lacks. Playing to the song of Jay and the Americans' Come A Little Bit Closer, the images of combat resonate with a stylish flair and a sense of wit. This sequence is very well choreographed and cleverly done. Would that the rest of the film have that same polish. I just couldn't get remotely close to this new entry to the Marvel series, especially when comparing it to the first marvelous 2014 Marvel movie. ￼This film entertains but unlike its highly enjoyable predecessor, this sequel lacks originality, inventiveness, and humor. Oh, it tries hard, but it leaves one with a feeling of bloated desperation. You really want to have that giddy feeling of joy once again, but everything this time around seems artificial and forced. The jokes repeatedly fall flat, the action is formulaic, and the plot(s) are heavy-handed. Many scenes go on far too long as the movie rambles from one misadventure on one planet to the next. All that is left is the faint reminder of camaraderie served by its capable cast and their yeoman-like contributions to their likable, if underwritten, characters.￼Fortunately for the film, the actors bring on the charm in major doses. Chris Pratt as wisecracking Peter Quill, Zoe Saldana as the tough warrior Gamora, Dave Bautista as the brutish but lovable Drax, and the fine voice-over work of Bradley Cooper as Rocket and Vin Diesel as Baby Groot reprise their misfit roles with finesse. Adding strong support are Mike Rooker, Karen Gillian, and a robust energy force in the form of Kurt Russell as Ego, Peter's long lost father.￼While James Gunn's direction is solid enough, his writing efforts are a disappointing mix. His dialogue is bereft of one-liners that zing. He tries (and mostly succeeds) adding more backstories to his characters and their dysfunctional relationships. The real problem is his script which sacrifices its more interesting sub-plots (the relationship between Peter and Gamora, Drax's new love interest, the sibling rivalry of Gamora and her sister, Rocket's rude personality issues, Baby Groot's learning curve) with the main story-line, a dull routine father- son conflict. Technically, some of his visuals are poorly executed. For a big budget blockbuster, the CGI is uneven. The characters of Rocket and particularly, Baby Groot are spot-on, Yet, the production design on most planets use of matte backdrops are far from authentic looking, lacking depth and details. Especially obvious in its ineptitude is Ego's world, showcasing a garish Jeff Poons vibe.￼Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 will entertain its loyal audience, but already the franchise is losing its comic focus. This installment keeps the action moving, but it rarely catches its breath as it huffs and puffs its way to its conclusion. Well, let me re-phrase that...until its next chapter. Yes moviegoers, Vol. 3 will be coming to a theater near you very soon...let's hope that chapter breaks out of its own comfort zone as it explores the ever-changing universe.",7,2,4,14 May 2017
Thor," Hammering Out Justice, Raking in the Money
","ThorThis film is mildly recommended.' If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning / I'd hammer in the evening / All over this land / I'd hammer out danger / I'd hammer out a warning...<ul><li>Lyrics from The Hammer Song by Pete Seeger &amp; Lee Hays</li></ul>Yes, the gods are angry again! And no, we mere mortals have not caused that reaction. It is an inside job this time. The gods have cast out Thor, son of Odin and the latest Marvel superhero to reach a movie theater near you. They have sent him crashing to Earth to learn a few lessons along the way. Now one might think that his mission is to hammer out justice to those who dare to cross his path, and although that may be somewhat true, his real mission is to reel in mucho dollars for Paramount Studio ( and indeed he will ). Yes, Thor, the first of the summer blockbusters, has finally arrived! Sit back and enjoy the ride!Shakespearean actor/ director Kenneth Branagh goes all Shakespeare on us with the film's plot and character development. He takes a tried and true formula as his blueprint: Tragedy + Comedy = Thor, and most of the time he succeeds in his vision. With this comic book tale, he amps up the Norse / Marvel mythology aspects and treats his film with a solid pedigree of opulence and pageantry that is usually not seen in this genre. Branagh still provides plenty of action sequences to please the built-in audience of fanboys everywhere. But he wisely throws in some Henry V, some King Lear, some Hamlet into the mix while juggling the lighter comic element that made the original Ironman such a successful enterprise. However, he does make some missteps along the way.Banished from Asgard due to his recklessness and arrogance and forced to live with us humans, Thor becomes a fish out of water as he time travels to the 21st century and tries to adapt to our planet's customs. It is here that he meets Jane Foster who will, of course, become his love interest and help him become a better man-god and it is here that the film excels in its charming and comic tone, if not in its originality.In fact, the film constantly shifts its vision ( and also its strengths and weaknesses ) with varying results jumping to scenes from modern day Earth, the Disneylike inspired Tomorrowland known as Asgard, and Jotunheim, the ice planet of Frost Giants. The modern day sequences work best due to the strong chemistry between the leads: Chris Hemsworth, in a breakout performance as the God of Thunder, displays a nice comic timing while also displaying a even more defined godlike torso. ( Let's face it, he looks and acts the part to perfection. As gods go, he's an 11! ); Natalie Portman is adorable and completely likable as his astrophysicist girlfriend, but it really doesn't tax her acting prowess. ( Let's face it, she looks and acts this throwaway part to silly perfection. But as astrophysicists go, she's an 5 at best! ). Stellan Skaragard and Kat Dennings as Jane's scientific crew provide able support to the proceedings. Also impressive are the battle sequences on the subzero Jotunheim with the villainous Frost Giants. This portion of the film is quite effective and makes for rousing fantasy entertainment. The visual effects and makeup are first rate and Colm Feore as King Laufey elicits the right menace necessary for all the Dark Forces to converge on our hero and his fateful allies.But it is on Asgard where I had serious problems was with the film's lack of inventiveness in its production values and familiar comic book storyline. ( This is the Shakespearian 'realm'.) After all, it is 965 A.D. when our story begins. Yet the illogical futuristic costumes are distracting ( helmets worn as ostentatious headdresses and tacky gladiator armor reminiscent of Hollywood's Cleopatra era ) and the laughable art direction is even worse. The setting is so overwrought with grandiose Art Deco style and Celtic inspired patterns that one wonders if the gods may have time traveled to future centuries and taken too many courses in art history and fashion design for such pretentious surroundings. ( At times, I thought I was at the Crystal Cathedral Ministries or some 1964 World's Fair pavilion with all the excessive gold leaf and gaudy crystal. ) Also caught in this world are Anthony Hopkins as Odin ( his best acting in years ), Tom Hiddleston as Thor's jealous sibling, Loki, and Idris Elba as Heimdall, Odin's loyal servant and gatekeeper to the realm. The actors go about their paces, don't look to ridiculous in all the gaudy trappings, and are able to extract fine performances from the insubstantial material they are given.Another misstep: the clash of the titans' duel between Thor and a cyborg rip-off. There is an awkward moment, a recycled formulaic similarity of robotic invaders from past films, from the animated Iron Giant to 1951's Gort (from The Day the Earth Stood Still ) to Ironman itself. And while there is nice CGI to enjoy, there is also a nagging sense of déjà in this sequence, a vision completely lacking any imaginative thought of its own.Still, Thor is a mighty sci-fi fantasy tale of redemption that is sure to be a real crowd- pleasing franchise even though it's a bit inconsequential. The action moves along at a brisk clip, the film thoroughly holds your attention, and it is what it is. As big summer blockbusters go, it will make a godlike ton of money and keep the Hollywood gods and moguls happy, that is, until the next superhero comes along ( which should be in about 2 weeks, I would guess.)

The Shape of Water," The Princess and the Frog: A Fractured Fairy Tale
","GRADE: A- THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A lyrical re-telling of an age-old love story that is hauntingly beautiful.SYNOPSIS: A mute falls in love with her outer beast.RUNNING TIME: 2 hrs. JIM'S REVIEW: We all know of Beauty and the Beast, a tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, etc. Mismatched souls who fight adversity and become one. The famed director, Guillermo Del Toro's, takes that most cliche of notions and creates a tender love story about a plain-looking mute servant who falls for a big scaly Creature from the Black Lagoon type. Not the most typical movie fare, granted, but doomed lovers nevertheless. Such is The Shape of Water, a swoon-worthy romantic story that is glorious filmmaking.Pure poetry in fact.It is 1963 during the Cold War. In a hidden laboratory, the government has a top secret experiment in the form of a captive beast. Chained and tortured, this creature searches for the tiniest bit of compassion and finally finds it in a lowly worker named Elisa, a lonely mute waif who also yearns for that human touch...or the next best thing.The director carefully sidesteps the sexuality and walks that fine line masterfully, avoiding any unintentional uneasiness with its sensitive subject matter. He fabricates a totally believable world of romance and longing. Adding to the overall romanticism is an insightful and poignant screenplay by Mr. del Toro and Vanessa Taylor that takes its rather rudimental storylines of espionage and governmental conspiracies and wisely pushes those plot devices aside to concentrate on the relationship of two misfits who happen to fall in love. The dialog and voiceover narration is quite beautiful and touching. Also noticeable is the subtleties of racial tension and homophobia in the plot. Yes, there is much at play in this film.The Shape of Water works its magic with its strong visual images, lensed by Dan Lausten, and a lush romantic score by Alexandre Desplat. The production design by Paul D. Austerberry is exquisite. The muted colors, all teals and rustics, cast a melancholy aura to the story which most effectively transports the moviegoer into a otherworldly universe. 'The world is a lonely place ' it seems to say, and its characters reinforce that sense of desperation and sadness.The entire ensemble is splendid. Sally Hawkins is an appealing presence as Elisa. The actress relies on her facial expressions and graceful movement to convey the character's isolation and angst. She glows with a radiance that embellishes Elisa's pain. Doug Jones is her love interest and he literally provides such fluid movement and elegance to the role. (Kudos to the creature design, an elongated mass of aqua scales and gills forming rippling musculature that enhances the attraction factor. Let's face reality, the surreal story is far-fetched and if the beast were a gelatin mass of ooze or a furry fanged monster, the love story could have been a tad unpleasant and possibly intolerable.) Yet, we too fall under the filmmaker's charming spell.Michael Shannon plays the real monster in the film, a villain with no redeeming traits. He provides the necessary hostilities and is a compelling force that advances the narrative, although one wishes the character was written in less black and white terms. Michael Stuhlbarg is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, an impassioned scientist who sees positive communication with this alien as a breakthrough for mankind and shows the many sides of a conflicted man wanting to do right. As Elisa's friends, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins are simply wonderful. Also memorable is Nick Searcy as the military-minded General Hoyt.As this fractured fairy tale gently unfolds its love story about 'a princess without voice' and a giant amphibian as her 'frog prince', it all sounds absurd. And it is. But The Shape of Water exists and works its magic so completely that one longs for it to be real. One of the year's best.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",10,18,32,27 December 2017
The Witch," Witchy Woman
","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: The Crucible meets The Shining meets Rosemary's Baby in Robert Eggers' well- received but wildly overrated debut film.GRADE: C+PLOT SUMMARY: Set in the 1600's, faith lends a shaky hand to a devout Christian patriarch and his family as they encounter strange occurrences in a small New England town. Labeled as heretics, the family is shunned by the community and settles near a dark forest with talks of witchcraft and other evil forces lurking about.JIM'S REVIEW: While the film is called The Witch, it is its subtitle, A New England Folktale, that reveals more about writer / director Robert Eggers' first film. Folktales were originally cautionary tales told to impressionable children to forewarn them of the dangers in the real world. The film uses its time and setting most ingeniously, recalling the religious repression of that period and the mass hysteria associated with sin and witchcraft in a Puritan village. It has also garnered the awe of many impressionable critics as well. While this psychological thriller has some strong and disturbing imagery, it cannot hide the many illogical twists in the plot that are more evident after the film reaches its unsatisfying conclusion.One is initially captivated by the story, production values, and acting as the film tells its tale of a family surviving on its own after being exiled by the community elders. There are strange satanic goings-on as they settle into the woods (a bad place to be in most fairy tale lore): daily fire and brimstone sermons from an arrogant shiftless father, William (Ralph Ineson), Katherine (Kate Dickie), a cold and hateful mother who seems more possessed than humanly possible, lustful glances by a confused son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), a pre-pubescent unhappy daughter, two creepy twins spouting evil talk, and a baby who goes missing. Nothing goes quite well for these outcasts.The atmosphere is indeed moody and eerie, although the pacing of the film is in need of some stirring. Eggers is a solid director, and a talent that shows much promise. He creates a wonderful setting with much historical accuracy and his penchant for occasional surreal images with black birds, goats, wild rabbits, and subtle uses of blood to accentuate the perils surrounding the family are haunting and very effectively done.The acting is uniformly strong. Mr. Ineson, sporting an anachronistic 21st century six-pack physique that could have tempted many a Puritan, handles the speechifying astutely and Ms. Dickie brings a sullen and disagreeable presence to her character, but it is the acting of the two younger members of the clan, namely Mr. Scrimshaw and Ms. Taylor-Joy who deliver the emotional connection needed to care about this stoic family and their creepy dilemmas.Yet, as the story progresses and more and more supernatural things befall these victims, the leaps of logic become harder to accept. Mr. Eggers' script ultimately lets down the audience. His flair for visuals compensates for a lack of cohesiveness in his screenplay. There is also an over-reliance of heightened sound effects and atonal musical cues that telegraphs something wicked before it comes this way. Just as folktales are themselves cautionary stories, The Witch may hold one's interest in its storytelling, but this reviewer must caution any moviegoer that this well-crafted tale will leave you more bothered or bewildered than bewitched.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,1,4,20 February 2016
Jersey Boys," Beached
","This film is mildly recommended.Oh, everyone's heard of Jersey Boys, the highly acclaimed Broadway smash musical. It's been running for years, nine and counting. Now, that show has spawned a new film adaptation, directed by Clint Eastwood, in hopes of duplicating that same success. The production was the typically jukebox musical with vignettes of dramatic scenes interspersed between the musical concert moments. While the show bristled with high energy and expert staging, the movie takes a more realistic and serious tone, as well it should, with the different media approach. But where on stage, the live performances captured the real essence of book and song, the movie version is a pale(rider) imitation.Now, one shouldn't compare two distinct art forms. So, with that said, I will concentrate only on the film version and see if the film can stand on its own merits. It does, a bit wobbly, but quite satisfactorily. ￼Jersey Boys dramatizes the beginnings and end of the popular 1960's singing group, The Four Seasons, spanning a ten year career. The film concentrates on the rise and fall of this singing group and their on-again / off-again relationships, particularly the back-story of its lead vocalist Frankie Valli (well played by John Lloyd Young). Song after song, the story unfolds in a Rashomon format, with each member of the group reminiscing, contradicting, and giving their own personal point of view of the action on screen.Eastwood misdirects the film by placing the melodramatics front and center and pushing the music to the back. He takes a straightforward approach to the material, having the actors speak directly to the audience with their asides which becomes a bit jarring. Still the musical numbers always entertain, even if they are never match the originals. In fact, some harmonies have a dissonant quality and shrill harmonies. Some of the orchestrations are mostly overwrought, especially the horn section in the live performance of Can't Get My Eyes Off of You. ￼ The screenplay by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice sanitizes the actual facts of this docudrama, but connect the dots in an artful manner. It celebrates the music but its narrative, with its all too prevalent gangsters from Jer-see and their Italian stereotypes, is far too predictable and slightly offensive. Wise guys and not-so-wise guys make up most of the characters involved in this tale, none of which is more obviously than mobster Gyp DeCarlo played by an all too recognizable Christopher Walken. ￼Jersey Boys starts off very slow. Their first hit song, Sherry, doesn't even surface until 40 minutes into the film. At that point, the film starts gain some momentum. As the group begins its slew of pop hits (Big Girls Don't Cry, Walk Like a Man), Jersey Boys showcases those ditties and others. The cast works hard and achieves much success due to their talents. Beside Lloyd, the other actors who make up the remaining members of the singing quartet are Vincent Piazza, Michael Lomenda, and Erich Bergen, all contributing fine support. Mike Doyle and newcomer Renee Marino make their characters memorable in their underwritten roles.But this film version of Jersey Boys lacks vital energy and excitement. Eastwood has always been a serious filmmaker and, in this case, he makes this film musical too serious for its own good. It's as if he sucked all the the life out of the original source and was determined to make a drama with music rather than a full scale musical. (The end credits show what fun the film could have been with some fancy choreography and staging added to the film.) To this director, the story remains sacrosanct and too often his decision (and that of the screenwriters as well) regulates the songs as mere background to a sketchy biography, whereas the reverse would have been more effective. There simply is no joy in Jersey Boys to be had. GRADE: B-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,2,24,21 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," The Cost of Freedom
","' The bin Laden operation was a landmark achievement by our country, by our military, by our Intelligence Community, and by our Agency, ' - Acting Director of the CIA, Michael Morell Films that claim to be based on a true story have a tendency to be hyperbolic and are usually far from the truth they claim to purport. Zero Dark Thirty has gained that infamous reputation in some circles. After rave reviews from critics and winning its share of awards, there has suddenly been a backlash of sorts against this film since its wider release throughout the country this month. Some governmental officials and lawmakers are demanding an inquiry into the facts leading to this docudrama about the subsequent manhunt for Osama bin Ladin. Kathryn Bigalow's controversial film has certainly struck a nerve with this emotional topic and America's methods to eradicate its number one enemy. In trying to connect the facts of this historic mission, Bigalow has also created a cinematic masterpiece, a thought-provoking and thrilling insider's look into the exhausting investigation that brought about this terrorist's death and, with it, some initial closure to the 9/11 tragedy. Revenge is said to be sweet, but this film shows the bitter aftertaste of freedom as well. And as for victory, at what cost?After 10 years from the collapse of the World Trade Center and the senseless loss of human lives, questions still need to be asked: Are we too close to this political mass murder to create an objective analysis of this event? Do we, as a country, fear the truth about our actions and those of our enemies? Can this or any film be therapeutic to our national healing, or is it all too soon? If not, then when? Zero Dark Thirty dares to explore these inquiries and shed some light on the actual mission. The title Zero Dark Thirty means an unspecific time between midnight and dawn, which were the estimated military time of the raid on bin Laden's secret headquarters. The film begins with a black screen. The sounds of that fateful Tuesday in September over a decade ago are heard. The pain, the chaos, and the cries of those innocent victims resonates. Without any visual support, the frightening images are fully realized, scarred in our memory. It is a devastating beginning that will lead to the film's devastating end. ( Kudos to Paul N.J. Ottosson's for his remarkable sound editing work. )The film uses fictitious characters to tell its tale, but is remarkable in its honest and detailed approach to its subject. The CIA agents are shown to be dedicated workers trying to piece together any clue to bin Laden's whereabouts, particularly one female agent named Maya ( the talented Jessica Chastain in another excellent performance ). Her obsession and tenaciousness bring her closer to solving this mystery. But it is this woman working in a man's world that helps to make the film even more complex and riveting, as she tries to excise anything in the way of her pursuit.It is apparent that Zero Dark Thirty was heavily researched and Mark Boal's compelling screenplay is a remarkable piece of concise writing mixed with factual data. The time-line of events compresses years of investigative fact-finding by the CIA with other al-Qaeda terrorist attacks globally. While initially the film takes its time to build and connect these story lines, causing the film to seem slow-moving, Boal then shrewdly focuses more on the historic events and less on the individual characters, except for our heroine who serves as the emotional center. This gives a more natural and realistic undercurrent, a gritty and raw sense of foreboding.Bigalow's direction is flawless. The film is concise and gripping throughout. The action sequences build tension so well and lay the groundwork for the film's memorable Navy Seals' climactic invasion, done in all of its green night vision glory. ( The editing by Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg and the photography by Greig Fraser in this set piece are exceptional. ) But perhaps the most controversial element of the film is in the beginning section of the film ( the Bush years ) when Bigalow doesn't shy away from the darker side of the investigation. Her ability to include the torture and the humiliation of prisoners as just one means to gain information for bin Laden's capture is on full display ( and probably was much worse than depicted on the screen ). It was an undeniable part of the logistics that led to bin Laden's demise. Still, these sessions are relentless and make for uncomfortable but necessary viewing for all serious moviegoers. ( And it is in these horrific scenes that our government leaders doth protest too much. Like it or not, violent interrogation methods played a pivotal role to the success of this mission, contrary to American government claims that the U.S. does not sanctioned such immoral tactics as water-boarding. ) Yes, war is hell and you are caught in all of its ugliness and horror. That is what makes Zero Dark Thirty such an important and courageous example of superior filmmaking.Zero Dark Thirty recounts the hunt for an extremist, but it also probes the ethics of war and all of the innocent and guilty casualties it leaves in its wake. From its opening sounds of horror to its concluding blood-soaked images, this important film comes full circle. This is a film not to be missed.

Some also believe that the execution of this terrorist leader in May of 2011 never happened and was orchestrated by the American government as a cover-up. This leads to yet another question: Whose truth is it anyway? And at what cost?",10,2,12,12 January 2013
Steve Jobs," A Great Innovative Film about a Great Innovator
","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: An innovative biography that celebrates the power of words.GRADE: A-It is the words that speak louder than the actions in Danny Boyle's beautifully made film, Steve Jobs. The set-up of this character study avoids the biographical clichés that befall many in this genre. The art of the conversation and the poetic phrasing of the words created in Aaron Sorkin's perceptive script delineate each character brilliantly and directly defines their relationships. The movie succeeds in large part to the fine direction and a literate screenplay that elevates the film to an higher level of excellence that is rarely equaled in today's cinema.￼Steve Jobs is divided into three very distinct chapters in Job's life and it is staged like a three act play: the introduction of MacIntosh personal computer (1984), the selling of his NeXT computer (1988), and the launch of the infamous IMac, his redemption project (1998). The film is a tad too theatrical in its presentation, although the director tries to camouflage this limited format with stylish imagery and archival footage that act as exposition between chapters.Meant to resemble Citizen Kane in its concept: the story of one man's success and its corrupting influence of power and greed, the film is a worthy imitation. Where that film took the story of William Randolph Hearse and created a fictional character and plot that was thinly disguised from the real life counterpart, with names changed to protect the filmmaker, Orson Welles from a libel suit. Steve Jobs, the movie, welcomes the analogy and doesn't care to hide any pretense of this modern day successful corporate CEO's life.￼Based of Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography, the film vividly depicts Jobs as a smart but unpleasant human being, willing to hurt anyone who attempts to connect to him emotionally. This includes his estranged daughter, Lisa. Again, it is Sorkin's dueling dialog that is razor sharp and fast as usual which impresses, as does the superior ensemble of actors involved.Seth Rogen plays Steve Wozniak, a former friend and colleague who supported Job's many innovative ideas and wasn't afraid to say no to the man, A terrific Kate Winslet is Apple's head of marketing and Job's loyal Girl Friday. Katherine Waterston plays Chrisann Brennan, his ex- girlfriend and mother to his illegitimate daughter whom Jobs refused to acknowledge for most of her life, It is this fractured relationship that becomes the crux of the film and a sage method to inject some humanism into this cold remote loner. Jeff Daniels is John Sculley, the father figure that Jobs admired most of his life and Michael Stuhlbarg subtly impersonates Andy Hertzfeld, his technical assistant whom he repeatedly mistreats. All are superb. ￼Boyle's only misstep, and it is a major one, is his decision not to use any prosthetics and hair or make-up design to try to emulate Job's physical features. Michael Fassbender doesn't look anything like the man (until the film's final section), which I found to be a overt weakness in the role of a real iconic personality. (Life can be unfair, but not that unfair. Jobs may have been a gifted genius, but he never had this actor's handsomeness too!) The lack of physical attributes interferes with a strong central performance and kept me at a slight distance from the character. The transformation seemed incomplete, although Fassbender has enough charisma and gravitas to make us believe in the ruthless character he is portraying, just not in Steve Jobs, the actual man. ￼The actor shows Job's abusive and competitive nature full throttle as he subjects his co- workers and family to his self indulgent whims and petty rages. Job's drive for fame and his lust for perfectionism in an imperfect world show this unhappy man front and center, as written. But Mr. Fassbender effectively delivers the many complex speeches with great passion and aplomb. (Ashton Kutcher, who played Jobs in an earlier film, actually looks more like the title character than this actor, but it is Fassbender's interpretation of the role that essentially captures the inner flaws of a man unable to feel any real emotion.) It is a fearless performance.￼Steve Jobs takes this arrogant control freak and savvy businessman and creates an in-depth character study that becomes riveting drama in the expert hands of its talented filmmakers. This is one of the year's best films and its eloquent screenplay is perfection. Do not miss this film.

Mudbound," No Man's Land
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5) GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A powerful film about bigotry with an exemplary ensemble.SYNOPSIS: in 1940's, two families struggle to survive in the Deep South.JIM'S REVIEW: It is a small patch of earth that brings together two Southern families in rural 1940's Mississippi in Dee Rees' powerful saga, Mudbound. Based on Hillary Jordan's epic novel, the film shows all the hardships and obstacles that follow these tenant farmers in the bigoted Deep South during the World War II era. Streaming on Netflix and opening in select theaters this weekend, this film is one of the better movies of the year. One hopes the film will gather more critical responses during award season, especially for its strong ensemble.We meet two dissimilar families: the McAllans, a white, semi-privileged clan who own the cherished land and the Jacksons, a black family who till the parched soil with hopes of buying and owning the property in the future. Their lives intersect as the story progresses. It does take a while for the set- up to begin, but it is well worth the wait. Laura, a well-to-do city girl with a sense of culture and pride marries Henry McAllan and is forced to settle on his family's farm, with his bigoted father named Pappy, a stereotyped hater if there ever was one, and Henry's handsome younger brother, Jamie,. (Yes another stereotype, and too obviously a plot device to create a melodramatic triangle.) Their neighbors are the proud and stoic Florence Jackson, her hard-working husband Hap, and their many children, including their eldest son, Ronsel. Both Jamie and Ronsel go off to war and come back emotionally damaged, unable to face the prejudice of townsfolk as these two become friends.The screenplay by Virgil Williams and the director covers much territory and creates characters that resonate in their humanity, or lack thereof. Their script has some flaws in its storytelling. The over indulgence of the voice-over narration becomes a bit tiresome, even though the words have a poetic lilt to them. This approach provides multiple perspectives from all of the characters, but it hinders their development at times. One wishes those words would have become part of the dialog and provide its glorious cast with more dramatic acting opportunities. The film also becomes too melodramatic in its subject, but it is handled with such emotional clarity and nuance that one can easily overlook those flourishes. Its complicated story and the scope of its material allows a subplot about an abused wife (though well played by Kerry Cahill) to intrude upon the central story. This does little to advance the narrative, except to provide a haunting image of blood-soaked land. That said, these are minor missteps that cannot diminish the film's overall impact.In fact, there are many memorable images in this film due to Rachel Morrison's photography (a a child pointing a brook handle at a white man pretending to shoot him dead, contrasting scenes of a woman washing herself clean of the dirt and shame, a harrowing sequence of a black soldier being told to use the rear door, etc.). Mako Kamitsuna's taut editing seamlessly interweaves war time scenes with the farm life sequences and transitions both with masterful skill. Ms. Dee's direction creates moments of undeniable beauty and unsettling tension. Her vision of the ongoing prejudice that permeated this town is palpable and makes the moviegoer sit up and take notice about the injustice and hatred (sadly still a part of America's fabric today). Particularly disturbing is the film's most graphic scene involving the Klan that is riveting and honestly depicts these heinous acts of violence. The cast is exceptional and work as a cohesive whole. Carey Mulligan as Laura brings an underlying sadness and strength to her part as the despairing Laura. Her female counterpart, an unrecognizable Mary J. Blige, is riveting as she helplessly watches her son make some questionable choices that she knows will have consequences. Jonathan Banks takes on the evil and loveless Pappy with such deep-seeded venom. Although the patriarch roles of both houses are somewhat underwritten, both Jason Clarke and Rob Morgan add the missing depth to their sketchy characters. Perhaps the most effective portrayals are given by Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell as the two friends. Mr. Hedlund gives his best performance to date as the alcoholic PTSD victim and Mr. Mitchell is a revelation, conveying all of the anger and confusion that many African- American soldiers faced returning from duty. His one speech comparing his acceptance of his blackness in Europe to his demeaning role as second-class citizen in America upon his returned is heartbreaking.In Mudbound, one character says, 'I dreamed in brown.' That statement conveys the heartbreak and power that is this thought-provoking film.",9,3,9,19 November 2017
12 Years a Slave," A Precious Gift Called Freedom
","This film is highly recommended.Is it better to be born blind, or deaf, or with some other hardship, than to once have had that sense, only to lose it later in life? You might think that this opening question is coming out of nowhere, but bear with me. To have lived with that precious gift and then to be forced to live without seems even more tragic and cruel. The loss must be all the more staggering. I bring this question to the forefront as it is the inescapable sense of loss that is the underlying concept in 12 Years A Slave, Steve McQueen's relentless and searing account of human trafficking, a true tale about Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejoiofor), an African-American musician who, in the earlier stages of his life, was a free man enjoying his life with his wife and family in the, only to be whisked away, bounded and shackled to spend most of his later years (1841 -1853)as a slave in the Old South.The desire for freedom always is just out of reach as we follow Solomon's harrowing journey. From free man to slave, his suffering in this film is palpable, as we witness scenes of persecution and endless humiliation packaged between moments of sadness and despair. Be forewarned: 12 Years A Slave is not an easy film to watch, as this viewer diverted his eyes from many sadistic acts of violence throughout the film. The torture and inhumane conditions are true representations of America's reprehensible past. The brutality seen in 12 Years A Slave is never gratuitous or used as a mere shock value stunt. It's there in full view, shown as it was then, and now chronicled and unable to be ignored.The privileges of whiteness and the freedom that came with that segregated class system has a more visceral effect in this film, seen in sharp contrast to the servitude and brutality that many slaves endured at countless plantations from master to master. The film's most convincing argument is how effortlessly injustice can marginalize one man's life.Mr. Ejoiofor is exceptional in his role as Solomon. The actor's use of his physical traits, his woesome and sad-eyed facial expressions and continued downward stare, subtly show the inner rage and helplessness of his character. His final scene is so moving and memorable, allowing the emotional release for his character and for the movie-going audience as well. As the villainous psychotic slave owner Epps, Fassbinder has the showier role and he tends to overplay the sexual depravity of the character with a tad too much glee. Yet the actor does register the proper degree of instability and intimidation, avoiding the aspects of a full-blown Simon Lagree stereotype. (McQueen should have reined the actor in at times, which would have made this excellent performance all the more real and effective.)The acting is stellar with strong supporting work by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye, and Alfre Woodard. Special mention goes out to the contributions of Lupita Nyong'o as the abused slave, Patsey, and Sarah Paulson as Epps' shrewish wife. Both actresses deserve Oscar nominations for their fine work in this drama. Only Brad Pitt seems miscast in his role due to his famous screen persona. (Yes, he's one of the film's producers, but a lesser known actor would have given the film the right degree of realism.)Director McQueen, along with his co-writer, John Ridley, have created a film of undeniable passion and haunting imagery, a mostly accurate and horrific history lesson for all of the world to see. His wonderful production team have crafted an indelible re-creation of pre- Civil War authenticity with stellar work from Patricia Norris' period costumes, Hans Zimmer's atmospheric music score, realistic sets by Adam Stockhausen and David Stein, and stunning cinematography by Sean Bobbit.There are so many memorable set pieces that are skillfully handled for maximum effect (a horrible lynching scene that seems to go on until tomorrow, Solomon overcome with despair and rage as he sings a spiritual, a burning letter that turns to embers and fades to black). There are some scenes that do go on far too long and overstate their message (a chase sequence between Epps and Solomon goes so over-the-top to the point of absurdity that it undercuts some of the film's emotional impact). More judicious editing could have solved that very minor complaint. (Also having a rather jarring effect is McQueen eagerness to show historical accuracy on one hand, yet the director tends to overlooks the fact that his actors (portraying either slaves or owners) seem to have taken so much special care on their dental work that the American Dental Association would have unanimously given the film its seal of approval. That said, the film is still a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.12 Years A Slave is a bold provocative film that forever shatters the myth of gentrifying the Southern Antebellum lifestyle. McQueen's film never hides from or whitewashes one of the most tragic chapters of American history. Its powerful story of one man's anguish and loss of freedom should resonate with any caring individual. Sadly, racism still exists in many parts of our country today. With such an important film like 12 Years A Slave as our ultimate proof, the lesson is well earned, if not yet well learned.

Joker," This Joker is Wild
","GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A terrific performance by Joaquin Phoenix makes this psychological thriller all the more memorable.JIM'S REVIEW: Going into Todd Phillip's Joker, I expected an origin tale about a super villain with standard comic book action, well choreographed stunt work, and enough CGI and explosions to cause any fanboy to fall into a stupor. I was greatly surprised and totally wrong!Instead, the film is a thoughtful examination of mental illness and also a thoroughly riveting psychological study of this iconic madman. The screenplay, by the director and Scott Silver, follows the mythology of DC Universe and its characters faithfully, with some added asides to their plot that seem more like a classy Martin Scorsese film than the typical comic book action fantasy genre. (This approach might disappoint the movie's younger target audience, but it had the opposite effect on this reviewer.)The movie aims to be much more in its depiction of a damaged man wanting to change the damaged world. This villain's method to his madness remains unhinged and savage, a product as cold and deliberate as the unforgiving society in which he exists. We go through each twist and turn on his journey toward insanity.Joker is the making of a murderer on a grand scale. Visually, Mr. Phillips skillfully delivers a film that is stunning to behold, from Lawrence Sher's stark use of chiaroscuro cinematography with vivid color and dramatic lighting to 's 60's meets 80's retro production design of a decaying Gotham. Add to that, the concise editing by Jeff Groth and Hildur Guðnadóttir's atonal music score that sets the ominous tone for the action on display.As the story unfolds, the film goes out of its way to make the title character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker), all too sympathetic to moviegoers. This loser has been so abused by society and is literally beaten down by everyone in his orbit. The odds are against him. He just can't win. One can only pity this man. Yet, do these acts of violence justify his harmful actions? The film wants us to believe so. In fact, the movie downplays the Joker's murderous spree to any victim other than those who are cruel or mean-spirited. This is revenge fantasy, plain and simple. The filmmakers seem to say that the bad deserve his wrath.As Arthur plunges further into the madness that is known as Joker, the killings too becomes gorier and justify vigilantism and violence. This is a major misstep in storytelling, and a tad dishonest in its plot structure, as are some of his delusions which are not being clearly established as real or imaginary scenes. The blur between illusion and reality remains a enigma. Still the film continually intrigues with its edgy style, top-notch production values, and an astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix that demands to be seen.One would hope that Mr. Phoenix's performance merits Oscar consideration. The actor creates a character that is so operatic and over-the-top which adds to the enjoyment of this drama. His Joker has all of the signature moves that are even more troubling and pronounced than in previous interpretations. He gives his character so much complexity and angst with a hint of desperation. His high pitched laughter, graceful posturing, and exaggerated movement help to create a mesmerizing presence. His painted clown mask is wore well in order to hide all of the torment bubbling up inside. It is a revelation, an acting tour-de-force that will be long remembered.Providing strong support are Robert DeNiro channeling his The King of Comedy heydays as talk show host Murray Franklin, Glenn Fleshler as Arthur's belligerent co-worker, Brett Cullen as corrupt millionaire Thomas Wayne, and Frances Conroy as Arthur's sickly mother.Joker is not your ordinary comic book story of a megalomaniac and his conquest for fame. It is a complex and disturbing character study with an extraordinary star turn at its dark and heartless core.",9,0,1,25 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Let's Do the Time Warp Again
","This film is recommended.What do you get when you mix the plot ideas of two classic films, the romantic comedy, Groundhog Day, and an old sci-fi thriller, Starship Troopers? You get its illegitimate offspring, Edge of Tomorrow (or the renamed: Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow, to be exact), a well-made sci-fi film that surprisingly failed at the box office in the States and Europe but earned far larger profits in the Asian markets abroad. It has now been resurrected in its DVD, Blu-Ray format under its new title. Will the film now have a longer shelf life and finally become a modest hit? Only time will tell.Starring the forever young Tom Cruise, chalking up yet another action figure to add to his resume, and the forever talented Emily Blunt, Edge of Tomorrow deserved a better fate. What it lacks in originality, it more that makes up in its thrilling action sequences and plot turns.The plot involves a military mission to stop an alien invasion by getting to the Omega, the source of power for the aliens and destroying it. The creatures (called Mimics?) are multi- tentacled spinning dervishes that dispatch their prey (meaning us) in mega seconds. Cruise plays William Cage, a soldier caught in a continuous time loop that creates the exact same moments  leading to his death by one of these monsters. Due to his untimely death and some sort of blood infusion, he discovers that he can control his fate with different outcomes every cycle.  With more practice training and guidance from a commanding officer Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), Cage becomes a better and more agile soldier, finally ready for combat. The film's plot structure gets a bit weary but Doug Liman directs the action scenes with much skill, even if the characters remain one dimensional. The film is well edited by James Herbert and Laura Jennings, with quick cuts and extreme close-ups to maintain the tension and fast pacing. At times, the film resembles a video game in its sharp hyper-kinetic movements and shoot-to-kill violence. The CGI are strong throughout even if the film's conceit grows monotonous.Cruise and Blunt have a nice chemistry, although the hints of their romantic relationship seems forced. Bill Paxton adds some comic touches as Cage's gruff boss, but Brendan Gleeson is wasted in his underwritten cliché of a character. Anyway, gamers and fan-boys are the film's target audience and they will enjoy the adrenaline rush of the endless war sequences in Edge of Tomorrow.

Pitch Perfect 2," Out of Tune
","(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)This film is not recommended. In brief: Off-keyGRADE: CPerfect Pitch 2 is slightly better than the original, only slightly. That is as much of a compliment I can give to this silly and dumb sequel. The film again brings the world of a cappella center stage and has non-stop vocal mash-ups that are suppose to entertain, but don't. ￼ Most of the actors reprise their roles to a lesser effect, especially Rebel Wilson playing Fat Amy, who is totally unfunny and unappealing this time around. Anna Kendrick and Hallie Steinfeld bring their individual charm to their parts as the main duo of the Barden College's Bellas. But it is only Elizabeth Banks, the film's director, and John Michael Higgins that bring real laughs and some major wit to their minor parts. Other actors in minor roles may have earned their paycheck but not the laughs from Kay Cannon's desperate screenplay. ￼ Perfect Pitch 2 lacks harmony and tries to celebrate woman's empowerment without much power. It's basically tone deaf.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4,1,10,26 October 2015
Whiplash," And The Beat Goes On
","This film is highly recommended. The need to create and the artistic challenges that go along with that innate desire are the force empowering the characters in Whiplash, a wonderful melodrama about a controlling teacher and his talented student. Their ongoing conflict is the basis for this film. Despite some overdone moments, it is one of this year's best.Skillfully written and directed by Damien Chazelle, Whiplash tells its conventional story very well. Andrew Neiman (Miles Telller) has a dream of becoming a first class jazz drummer and nothing will stand in his way. He practices daily, to the point of bloody self-destruction,and gets the attention of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a demanding conductor at the school whose high standard of excellence becomes Andrew's mantra.Chazelle has made a stylish film with superb editing by Tom Cross that follows the riffs and rhythms of its musical score while focusing on its central players. The passionate performances by Teller and Simmons are remarkable. Their rehearsal scenes crackle with tension as their relationship builds to become a master class in acting. Teller conveys the youthful eagerness to please with the vulnerable side of a gifted musician's fervent interest in his art. Simmons has been given the role of his career. There is no beloved Mr. Chips on campus. This professor lobs his barbed words at his class for direct impact and makes his tirades sting with indignation. If Simmon's memorable role as the overly zealous Fletcher is overlooked this award season, then the rules need to be revamped immediately. However, the logical question does arise and make one pause to the actual reality of academia: could a music professor be so sadistic and cruel and still be in charge of this class? The physical and mental abuse he inflicts on his pupils is layered with constant profanity, racial slurs, and acts of violence that certainly would never have given him tenure, let alone keep a job. This leap of logic almost tilts the story to absurdity.But the dramatics outweigh the reality of the situation. The film is so well crafted and boasts two of this year's finest performances that it demands your attention. Whiplash is emotionally involving from its first note to its last.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Street Wiseguy
","This film is recommended.Wall Street and its 'greed is good' philosophy has always been such an easy target. With its luxurious life style excesses and its wheelers and dealers always on the make, the rise and fall of one man seems only par for the course.  Such is the case of Martin Scorsese's manic and fully energized film, The Wolf of Wall Street. The film is good to a fault, the fault being an excessive amount of excessiveness, both on the screen and behind the camera lens. Clocking in at three hours, The Wolf on Wall Street starts to outstay its welcome rather quickly. The frat-boy shenanigans and high testosterone level just wears you out rather than grab your interest.Based on the real life memoirs of Jordan Belfort, the film tracks the beginnings and the end of this trader and con artist who bilked many unsuspecting clients from their life savings. Played by Leonardo DiCaprio, we follow this amoral character and his illegal dealings whose schemes seem to be so over-the-top and outlandishly stranger than non-fiction. That becomes the film's fatal flaw as too many liberties have been taken from the actual facts that the film borders on inanity and loses all credibility as the film reaches its conclusion.The Wolf on Wall Street takes its title character, Jordan 'Wolfie' Belfort, and parades his hedonistic antics front and center. His exploits are highly exploitive and wholly inappropriate, from his dwarf throwing party and steady stream of drugs, alcohol, and sex to his fast expensive cars and even faster expensive women.  He trades in one loyal wife for a sleeker and more buxomly model. He apprentices and corrupts an nebbish assistant (well played by Jonah Hill) who is more than willing to sell his soul for a price.  In fact, everyone in this film has no moral compass, including Scorsese who relishes in this outrageous behavior to the point that the director appears to take a perverse glee with the numerous gratuitous shots of full frontal female nudity and orgasmic debauchery on the screen.In the film, Scorsese treats his subjects as white collar gangsters sans the violence, familiar territory for this director. The director has his signature swooping camera-work (fine work by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto) and flashy editing which is perfectly suited for this type of film. His journey into their orgasmic drug-induced world is still an engrossing adventure that is thrilling to experience  but also disturbingly unsettling. He is a master filmmaker and his film is so well executed and a wonderful comic diversion mainly due to DiCaprio's marvelous performance.The actor throws himself fiercely into this role and he creates a fully developed and charismatic scoundrel. He delivers his many tirades and spiels with an edgy bravado and, in one scene while high on Quaaludes, DiCaprio shows off his fine comic timing with tightly controlled slapstick movement that is quite impressive. Strong support is contributed by Rob Reiner, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, and especially by Margot Robbie as Wolfie's trophy wife.Still there are far too many scenes that go on and on needlessly to the point of overstatement and tedium. More judicious editing would have only improved the finished film. The screenplay by Terence Winter truly captures the avarice motives of the stockbroker's well and has wonderful dialog even though some of the character's action remain unexplained in their unbridled admiration for Jordan.The Wolf of Wall Street is always entertaining but its excessiveness and overwrought narrative makes the film a loud and bloated exercise in expert filmmaking that never carries any emotional impact. The film huffs and puffs and eventually blows its own house down with its own pretentious ambitions.

It Chapter Two," It's Just Bound to Go Pop
","GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well crafted supernatural thriller that pales to its original source, but still is a fine sequel to its predecessor.JIM'S REVIEW: Does It: Chapter Two have the 'It Factor', that indescribable 'je ne sais quoi' allure that its predecessor was able to capture so vividly with moviegoers two years ago? Yes and no.This supernatural horror sequel is again resurrected by director Andy Muschietti and many of his same crew of artisans in hopes to recreate that same bad magic. For the majority of the film, It succeeds in capturing the scary action and establishing a link with the now grown-up cast of characters so convincingly that the audience immediately relates to them and their deadly peril. While It: Chapter Two, more than not, generate the fear factor, this chapter slowly build its scenes of suspense and spends far too much screen time on exposition and subplots that do little to advance the storytelling. The film seems bloated with uneven CGI effects this time around and its formulaic set pieces almost outstays its welcome due to the movie's avid fixation with the gore factor. Less would have been more.The second chapter of the Loser's Club opens twenty seven years later with a particularly grisly and gratitious hate crime that signals the return of the infamous Pennywise the Dancing Clown. This prologue lingers in one's mind with a bad aftertaste of remorse even though it serves as the catalyst for the new cast of actors to reassemble back at Derry, Maine to fight evil forces. But unlike the first film, this and other moments have a mean-spirited glee that the first film avoided. The extreme violence of this killing hangs over the movie like a shroud of discontentment before the new cast of actors is reassembled and moviegoers can settle in for the fright-fest. Fortunately, the cast and Stephen Kings's essential story overcome this initial dread.Mr. Muschietti skillfully directs his film and turns up the horrifying action. He stages his set pieces with flair and expertly casts his movie with older actors that inhabit their parts with masterful interpretations of their former younger selves. Each actor has an episode that shows off their character's phobia as they battle with their own demons. This more mature ensemble includes: James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, Isaiah Mustafa, Andy Bean, James Ransome and Bill Hader. All are fine, with Mr. Hader and Ms. Chastain excelling in their roles.But without Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd as their evil nemesis, the film simply would not be as effective. HIs vocal delivery, physical movements, and iconic make-up as Pennywise ratchets up the tension and delivers the scares. Providing ample support (in flashbacks) are the original young actors from the first film and their presence is crucial to the film's success.Gary Dauberman's screenplay is very faithful to Stephen King's novel to a fault. (However, some judicious editing of numerous sub-plots could have improved and streamlined the movie much further.) The adaptation creates recognizable set-ups that have a sense of familiarity (the overuse of well-worn horror film staples that are all too obvious like a spooky fun-house with its hall of mirrors, a creepy mansion, the dark wet sewers, etc.). But partaking of these troves is half of the fun and Mr. Dauberman's penchant to fully develop his characters and their unique quirks heightens the frightening action on display. Too bad, he didn't eliminate the unnecessary multiple storylines that complicate matters or connect some secondary characters more astutely.Yet when plot and characters are rendered with a focus on childhood traumas and the dramatic life-or-death scenario is in place as they are in this imaginative installment, the effect is all the more impressive and relevant, even if the material itself has now become a standard horror package of stock characters caught in stereotypical surroundings. (Special mention to cinematographer Checco Varese and editor Jason Ballentine for their contributions for creating the unease. Benjamin Wallfisch's music score builds the foreboding atmosphere very well.)It: Chapter Two brings a memorable end to Stephen King's tome. While this final chapter is not as scary as its first part, Mr. Muschietti and his able cast provide an apt conclusion to this classic opus of terror.",7,1,3,7 September 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Charming but Still Overbaked
","GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A romanticized view of WWII and British rural life.JIM'S REVIEW: The British love a good period romance story. Period.The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society fills the bill for those in need of a slightly charming tale of love and a whiff of mystery. Lots of picturesque cliffside views, fields of wildflowers and stone cottages, a bucolic setting which seems like a travelogue for a simpler way of life, the kind of rural village where Miss Marple would reside, minus the murders. There's plenty of quirky town-folks minding their manners and own business and keeping their little secrets and lies well hidden.The time is 1945, and author Juliet Ashton comes to hear of the literary group and begins to question their historic origins as inspiration for an upcoming article. This fascination leads her to the island of Guernsey where she meets the book club and its members including a handsome pig farmer in the group named Dawsey Adams. As Juliet investigates and researches her story which leads her to the German occupation five years earlier and its effect on the town, she discovers a direct correlation with the casualties of war and this reading circle of friends.Mike Newell directs his film straightforwardly, without much flair. He tends to sanitize the proceedings. Everything is a tad too clean and polished. (The pig farm seems to be spotless and idyllic; at times, I expected the cute piglets to start speaking aloud ala Babe.) In fact, nothing in the film has any period authenticity. It is all dress-up time in 40's era clothing and set design. The mystery subplot is quite predictable and vastly underplayed. The actions of some of the characters make no real sense except to advance the plot to its inevitable romantic outcome.However, he assemblies a fine cast of British actors, familiar faces from Masterpiece Theatre imports and independent British fare: Penelope Wilton (strong as always), Matthew Goode, Glen Powell, Jessica Brown Findley, Katherine Parkinson, and Tom Courtney, all good, even if the story is a trifle. Lily James and Michiel Huisman, both quite likable performers, play the misfit lovers, without much chemistry between them. (They share one of the least passionate kisses ever filmed.) Oddly, they are more convincing in their separate scenes with the other actors.Still, the film entertains throughout, although its conclusion is, pardon the pun, hogwash for the realists in us all. (Yet the romantics out there just might wallow in the film's cheap sentimentality.). While The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is never (sorry!) 'unappeeling', it left this moviegoer expecting more. In all honesty, the title is more interesting than the film itself.",7,0,1,5 September 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not Much to Laud
","(RATING: ☆☆½ out of 4) THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: The comedy can be found in the Coen Brother's film, but it's sporadic mayhem at best, thanks mostly to a wonderful cast. GRADE: B-Journey back to the heyday of the Hollywood film studios and their bevy of stars who lit up the movie screens! The Coen Brothers' latest film, Hail Caesar, still has its stars acting aces, production values that wow, but not much to laud with a tiresome plot that barely comes together.￼The film is an homage to the old Hollywood system, but it rarely builds to an absurd laugh-out- loud farce, rather settling on intellectualizing debates about faith and redemption during the Red Scare of the 50's. (However, I did have a non-stop grin on my face throughout the film.) The direction by Ethan and Joel Coen remains solid as they mock and worship these celebrities with their high cheekbones and chiseled physiques, ill-equipped to handle life, let alone fame and fortune. On the studio's roster are such choice characters, both behind and in front of the cameras. At the forefront is Eddie Mannix (a highly effective Josh Brolin) whose 24 / 7 job at Capital Pictures Studio is to put out the many fires ignited by the studios' acting talents (?). His clients include: DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an Esther Williams bombshell who wisecracks and grouses her way through every take, Hobie Doyle (a breakout performance by Alden Ehrenreich, channeling a Sal Mineo vulnerability to perfection) as an empty-headed Western star, Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum, making Gene Kelly proud) playing a song and dance man, and Baird Whitlick (an amusing George Clooney) as a rugged leading man type starring in a ripe religious epic in the style of vintage Ben Hur but without the class.￼Adding to Mannix's problematic issues are Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) as a temperamental film director (but then who wouldn't be with this stars), Tilda Swinton as dueling gossip columnists, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, and in an all-too-short scenes, C.C. Calhoun (a funny Frances McDormand) as a frustrated film editor and an unethical agent named Joseph Silverman (Jonah Hill). The ensemble is flawless and wondrously dopey, but they are let down by a screenplay that never aligns or engages its characters.￼The film succeeds in mixing other genres (film noir, musical comedy, screwball comedy, Biblical spectacle) and this pastiche are the film's highlights. As long as the film remains on the studio stages, the film works. Were Hail Caesar! to focus more on these marvelous parodies, the movie would be a memorable classic bit about Old Hollywood. Instead it veers off course with subplots about Communist writers, a kidnapping plot, and religious affirmation scenes which goes on far too long without much merriment or laughs. The tone becomes stiflingly serious and labored and one wants more time spent on the wacky antics from these Hollywood types lost on the film set.Still, there are so many standout moments to revel: Tatum's energetic six minute tongue- definitely-in-cheek dance number entitled 'No Dames', Johansson's Busby Berkeley synchronized swim spoof, McDormand's all-too-short stint, Ehrenreich's singing cowboy's lack of intellectual sparring with the overtly sophisticated Fiennes, Clooney's exasperated buffoonery, etc. This ensemble creates vivid and interesting characters ready to leap to screwball heights but they are weighed down by a screenplay that misses so many golden opportunities to become a riotous comedy. The parodies are spot-on, the plot is duller than need be.As previously stated, the film is a well-crafted look at Tinseltown, with kudos to the astute production design by Jess Gonchor, lovely period costumes by Mary Zophres, and Technicolor- inspired camera-work by the prolific Roger Deakins.￼If the plot itself tends to meander all over the place and, too often, loses some of its light- weight footing, the small pockets of perfected glee from the Coen's inspired cast of delightful characters make the film a pleasant enough diversion. Here, it's the individual scenes of the film, the movie-within-the movie segments, which more than make up for the many missteps in this disappointing film.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,2,5,11 February 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Going Ape
","(RATING: ☆☆½ out of 5) GRADE: C THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Kong's back...bigger and duller.JIM'S REVIEW: 'Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and'...wait a second...that's the wrong beast movie! Hmm...let's try again...'Is that a monkey?'...Yeah, now we have the right beauty and her beast tale. This remake, newly titled Kong: Skull Island, has no real love story or any remote emotional connection. Beauty does not kill the beast in this update. No, instead, we have boredom that kills the moviegoer. While the CGI is very well done, especially the immaculate detailing of matted fur and expressive eyes on our big silly ape, other features are sorely missing, like believable characters, a plot that makes sense, action sequences that build tension, dialog that sounds authentic. Would that the filmmakers had spent more energy and effort on a convincing script, the film could have at least been entertaining. It just wastes everyone's time. The King Kong legend dates back to 1933, with numerous remakes (including the vastly superior one by Peter Jackson in 2005). But our reboot begins in 1943 until it fast forwards to 1973. The plot (as before) involves a group of explorers who venture onto a primitive island filled with monsters, historic beasts, and a big galoot of a gorilla. This time, however, Kong rules over the island (sans the King, because no one likes a monarchy anymore). Not only is our ape 'as big as a building', he is literally a treehugger who cares about ecological balance. When he feasts his eyes on the lovely Mason Weaver (Brie Larson, a poor-man's substitute for Fay Wray), there is no love interest. It's more of a mutual admiration society, as if she is an active member in PETA.While no animals were injured in the making of this film, several fine actors have certainly damaged their reputations. Such talented actors like Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Shea Whigham, and the aforementioned Ms. Larson, are wasted in their underdeveloped roles. Only John C. Reilly succeeds in making his character interesting.Besides the fine special effects, the only other redeeming feature is the stunning cinematography by Larry Fong that does impress, although his photography aligns itself too frequently to Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now with its wartime imagery of whirling helicopters and red-lit skies. But one has to admire that he set the bar high for his goal.The direction by Jordan Vogt-Roberts is not that lofty. It is merely adequate. He stages the action scenes well enough but relies too heavily with a 1970's pop soundtrack that overstates everything. All seems rote and predictable. The dangers the characters face are not the least exciting as there is no build-up or tension. His pacing of the film is off-kilter. (The film takes a good half hour even before the mission begins.)However, the majority of the blame goes to its rightful source, the screenplay-by-committee team of Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein, and Derek Connolly. They strand the actors on the island with banal conversation, long tedious exposition, and stock characters. (At one point, the travelers are warned about the giant ants on this isle, but they never make an appearance in this misguided adventure/fantasy. Nary a crumb in sight.)Kong: Skull Island is just not a very enjoyable movie experience. The CGI holds your interest momentarily, but there are no real scares or thrills in this monster movie. This Kong may be a lot bigger, but it's not a whole lot better.",5,1,3,11 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Battle Fatigue
","￼ This film is mildly recommended.Let's face it: The Hobbit film series was bloated and overblown from its initial start. The slim book became a overly-massive trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, in the hopes of making a classic epic story with his prior Lord of the Rings fame and pedigree. The first film from this franchise was a disappointment, with too much broad slapstick and silliness; the second was a vast improvement with its darker mood and stronger character development, although its ending was abrupt and too much the cliffhanger. Part Three, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, immediately takes flight from that final shot of Smaug, escaping and soaring above, set to raise havoc on the village and its habitants below. ￼Three may not be the charm, but it does have some thrills, more so in the hand-to-hand combat sequences toward the end of the film, less so with the endless army battles on a grand scale. Jackson and his company provide enough of a rousing adventure even if their overuse of CGI sacrifices its characters and story. Too often, the film resembles a video game in far too many action sequences. While it's true that everything about this film installment entertains, it all seems frenzied and artificial.￼The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies also seems choppy and redundant. While there is much to admire technically and the visual look of the film is epic, Jackson pacing is off this time around as he undercuts his suspense with the episodic structure of the film. He becomes too preoccupied with the war sequences and their staging, relishing in the slaughter and celebrating the war, the very antithesis of the Tolkien source. But it does sell more tickets.￼The actors try to bring some depth and emotion to their underwritten roles, but seem to be mere pawns in Jackson's action gamer. Most of the actors overplay their roles with hammy facial expressions and gestures, barking out the dialog rather than subtly underplaying their line delivery. Some of the sound design is over-amplified to give a more dramatic spin, but the opposite effect applies. Coming off best are Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, Ian McKellan, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Aidan Turner and Evangeline Lilly; others like Lee Pace, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, and, at times, Richard Armitage suffer with their poorly written characters. However, Ryan Gage as Alfrid plays his character like a Monty Python wannabe, trying for comic relief and coming up this short of annoying. Even more talented actors seem wasted with mere walk-ons like Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Hugo Weaving.￼Production values continue to be top notch, particularly the art direction by Simon Bright and Andy McLaren. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies could have used a lot less armies and a lot more depth in the characters and story. The war may have been won, but the battles were lost in this film adaptation.

Murder on the Orient Express," The Mustache Did It
","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 stars) GRADE: C+ THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: This film gets derailed in its confused storytelling, a less than stellar cast, and some misdirection...facial and otherwise.SYNOPSIS: Agatha Christie's classic murder mystery is remade for today's modern audience.JIM'S REVIEW: I think it was...Kenneth Branagh...on the train...with his mustache...that killed the movie. The who, what. where, and how may be answered in this unnecessary remake of Murder on the Orient Express, but the 'why' still nags at this moviegoer. Why dig up this buried gem when one could easily view the far superior 1974 murder mystery classic by Sidney Lumet and his all-star cast of screen legends (Finney, Bergman, Bacall, Connery, Redgrave, and such)? Can this new treatment with state-of-the-art CGI, a more expensive budget, and a cast of today's recognizable actors improve upon this tale of murder and deceit? ￼The answer is a resounding 'no' in comparison. The specter of Mr. Lumet's masterful film haunts this earnest but standard remake. It's foolhardy filmmaking that does little to improve its literary source. Whereas the 1974 version streamlined a convoluted plot, focused on some fine directorial touches, brought an air of elegance in its elegant Art Deco decor, delivered some interesting well-written characters, and added a first class tier of legendary actors to its roster, this new, but far from improved, update muddles its complicated story, provides stagy direction, has an dark sedated period look, introduces some characters in need of more clarity and motive, and brings a second class group of celebrities to this remake (combined with a few star-worthy replacements). Overall, this 2017 tale has lost all of its sense of glamour, wit, and fun.It seems that rebooting and re-imagining has taken the place of creativity these days. So with that said, my remainder of my review on this latest attempt to fill the pockets of the producers and filmmakers will try to concentrate on only this movie...a hard task, indeed.￼For those newbies unaware of the plot: Aboard a high-class speeding train, is super sleuth, Hercule Poirot. It is there that our fussy Belgian hero meets a shady criminal who fears that he will be killed before disembarking and asks our fastidious detective to prevent his demise. Alas, the deadly deed does take place (no real spoiler here) and the list of passengers become his targeted suspects as he unravels the mystery. Clues are scattered through the narrative as, one by one, each traveler converses with Monsieur Poirot. Rest assure, the culprit (or culprits) will be found by the film's end.The casting is paramount to make this mousetrap work. Mr. Branagh serves as director and lead actor and his dual contributions are a tad uneven. As a director, he layers the narrative with some skill but never involves his audience, choosing to look more at the panoramic scenery than concentrate on the characters. The screenplay by Michael Green doesn't help matters either. The film begins with a totally unrelated crime that establishes Poirot's quirky behavioral traits but adds little to the plot, except confusion.￼However, Branagh the Actor captures the detective's dialect and his mannerisms well, but he is essentially miscast by his own physicality...and his odd choice of including that ridiculous fur- piece posing as a mustache to the Poirot character. Yes, it is a trademark of the sleuth, but, seen here, it is an absurd facial prop that interferes with the character and the story. He takes the term 'stiff upper lip' far too literally. Always upstaged by the damn mustache, the actor fights for equal screen time and loses the battle. Plus the fact that the actor himself is rather tall and handsome upends Agatha Christie's unlikable but beloved toady character.￼Some 'stars' match their predecessors with style (Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer), others acquit themselves rather nicely (Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr. ), a few are underused and underwritten (Willem Dafoe, Olivia Coleman, Derek Jacobi, Johnny Depp) but some haven't a clue on how to create a memorable character (Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz). In their defense, the writing may be suspect too.￼Jim Clay's fine production design shows off the opulence without the elegance. Cinematography is first-rate and the period costumes are true to the period but hardly show- stopping. However, the CGI avalanche scene is so fake and jarringly bad that is literally stops the film cold. No, this cinematic game of Clue remains a mystery. With all its fancy trappings, Murder on the Orient Express may look the part. But under closer examination, some less than stellar casting bits, a few excessively theatrical moments, and a meandering script make this whodunit more of a 'why-do-it'.￼NOTE: Those unfamiliar with Dame Agatha's book or the previous aforementioned Lumet film may enjoy this movie more than those already acquainted with the story and its twisty ending. I was mildly disappointed with the end result.",6,0,6,15 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Pet Tricks
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Too many chase scenes detour a good movie down the wrong path.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Pets' private moments (without their owner) get more complicated for two dogs lost in the real world.The unconditional love and endearing behavior of a pet infuses me with a giddy sense of outright joy. As a life-time pet owner and an avid dog lover, I realize the importance of a four- legged friend in one's life. A pet will bring out your inner child and my latest member to the family, Zoey, is happiness personified. ￼In the animated film, The Secret Life of Pets, animals are personified as well, taking on human traits, especially when their master is away. That is the on-going premise of this film and since I may be a tad biased, as my interest in this film was as comparable as my dog's overwrought joy in getting a new stuffed toy, I have decided to let my intelligent and sensitive pooch handle the reviewing. So....￼ZOEY'S REVIEW: Hello, dear moviegoers. It's me, Zoey! For those who may not know me, I am a miniature wirehair dachshund with a high I.Q. and I love food, people, playing with toys, and watching cars and movies, in that order. I was asked by my owner, whom I call Daddy Jim, to review a new movie called The Secret Life of Pets, a film that does a disservice to animals in general for spilling the beans about our private moments when you are not around. First off, don't believe it. We are trustworthy creatures who avoid any possible danger. Remember this is not a documentary. It's fiction! That said, I can honestly say that the film was funny and had some nice characters that I enjoyed, especially, the two alpha dogs, Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet).￼The story goes like this: One day Max's owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), brings home a new pet, Duke. Neither are overjoyed with the prospect of sharing their time or attention with their human friend. (I wouldn't either, so already I relate to this situation.) So both go about sabotaging each others' place in the house which leads to problems later.￼Now some of the shenanigans become too far fetched...did you say fetch?... especially as they are chased by a dog catcher...I know, a cliché....and meet up with a gang of strays led by an angry rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who dislike the tamed set...hmm, now that was an interesting development. While I was constantly amused by the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the lovely animation, the screenplay lacked depth and plot development. NO, I wasn't expected Shakespeare, although Hamlet is one of my favorite reads, but I did want something more than one chase after another...and, mind you, I do love to chase rabbits in my yard. (I also did not need a jarring dream sequence that takes place at a meat factory that just doesn't work. Its inclusion gives the film far more filler than any hot dog should endure.)￼Still The Secret Life of Pets has many humorous moments and captures the movements and nature of animals very well. It also establishes some strong characters with the other critters in the neighborhood, such as Gidget (Jenny Slate), who loves Max so dearly, Chloe, a cat who loves no one but herself (like most cats I know), Tiberius (Albert Brooks), a hawk who continually fights his true hunting instincts, and Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a smooth dachshund to whom I particularly related. as I enjoy his noble breed so much.￼Now I know animals cannot speak human, even though I am very verbal...just ask my daddy. So I was very surprised to hear the animals converse in English...that is, until I saw the end credits and understood. So, there is good voice-over work by most actors in these roles, particularly Mr. C. K., Mr. Stonestreet, that veteran of voice-overs, Mr. Brooks, and Ms. Bell, although Mr. Hart and Ms. Slate's vocal demands are overdone and too intense for my liking.￼While the animals in The Secret Life of Pets are not as smart of as sweet as me, they certainly will win you over. The film is fine family entertainment and filled with charm and...oops, gotta go...dinnertime!Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,4,7,18 July 2016
Finding Dory," The Film Works Swimmingly Well
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A fish-out-of-water tale that celebrates family, friendship, and disabilities. GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Little Dory goes on a search for her parents and overcomes many hardships along her journey.The search is on yet again in Disney / Pixar's sequel to its 2003 hit, Finding Nemo. Only this time it's not Marlin hunting for his son, but his lovable and forgetful sidekick on the road to find out. Things go swimmingly in this latest chapter. Finding Dory takes the same initial premise and repackages it into a family-friendly always entertaining computer-generated fantasy.￼The same love and care is on display in this finely crafted animated feature as before. The sequel may not be as original as its predecessor, (it isn't), but it is still packed with enough emotion, insightful dialog, and visual awe. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, Finding Dory finds the right course in telling its tale of a little fish with short term memory loss overcoming the odds in search for her family.￼Visually, the film remarkably creates its under the sea universe. The reflections, rich color palette, and lighting effects are rendered with expert details. There is so much to take in with the background photo realism, plus the character animation has subtle textures and expressions that provide an inner story to each character.￼Yet, the deeper message in this children's film is its celebration of disabilities. Weaknesses become strengths in overcoming adversity and we moviegoers cheer our characters onward. Their quest eventually takes them to a marine research institute and, once the trio hits dry land, the sense of underwater wonder dries up a bit too. At this point, the script loses its way and starts to take an all too familiar route, introducing new adorable characters (and possible tie-ins at toy stores), leading to another zany far-fetched climactic chase scene and eventual reunion. Still, the predictability of the formula works yet again and tugs at our emotional core.￼Behind the microphones are a talented cast of celebrities voicing these lovable characters. Taking center stage is Ellen DeGeneres' Dory. The comedian gives her character a wonderful sweetness and breathless wonderment as Dory encounters new experiences along the way...but then, everything is new to our absent-minded heroine. Albert Brooks returns again as Marlin, and Hayden Rolence takes over as Dory's sidekick, Nemo, and they make a delightful tag team. Providing vocal support are Idris Elba, Dominic West, Ty Burrell, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, with Ed O'Neill stealing every scene as crotchety Hank, the seven-armed camouflaged octopus.Not in the same league as the aforementioned 2003 film, Finding Dory essentially tells a familiar (and overly cute) story, although it relies a bit too much on its original source. The film still visually enchants and allows the moviegoer to sit back and enjoy the humorous adventure as one little fish conquers its own disability to find inner strength and happiness. Perfect family fare and beguiling in its under-the-sea eye-popping technicolor beauty, Finding Dory is not a top-tiered Disney / Pixar classic, in the lines of Toy Story, Up, or Ratatouille, but it is a very fine addition to the studio's cinematic resume.NOTE: Showing with this film is an animated short called Piper. The film is charming and a shoo-in as an Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Short Film. Wordless and gorgeous in its splendid details and textures, the film tells a story of a little sandpiper gaining courage against the forces of nature. Delightful.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,21,44,18 June 2016
Arrival," Flight Delayed
","(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A boring intellectual sci-fi dud.   GRADE: C-  SYNOPSIS: Another alien invasion, but more seriously-minded.  JIM'S REVIEW: One may find this review a bit odd as I begin discussing  Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, but bear with me. This popular 40's comic  duo, known for their classic skit, Who's on First, a comic  confrontation involving quick verbal wordplay, have an indirect link  with Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, but one yearns for their  lightning-fast patter to replace the slowly-paced dialog in this slog  of a sci-fi thriller. The wordplay in Eric Heisserer's boring  screenplay is in need of some of that raw energy although the  director's visual dexterity does momentarily disguise the film's  numerous flaws.  This movie-going experience is interested in the thought-provoking  cosmos more akin to Close Encounters of the Third Kind than the usual  Independence Day mayhem. Are these visitors dangerous extraterrestrials  bent on world domination...or do they travel in peace? The director and  screenwriter leave that question dangling throughout this film as we  earthlings come to terms with their sudden invasion to our planet.  Panic has invaded the thoughts and minds of the denizens of Earth (much  like the recent election results from America have permeated our  mindsets). Only this time the life-form in question is not  orange-tinted, rather grayish in tone. Twelve hovering pod-like  spacecrafts with their visitors safely aboard now dot our global skies,  a shocking reminder that we are not alone.  Coming to our aid is Louise Banks, a linguist who is enlisted to  decipher their message. As others become unnerved, Louise stays the  course. Fascinated by our visitors' communication, a series of swirling  inkblots that languish in the air, she becomes consumed with their  visual exchanges of information. It gives her purpose and helps her  forget about family tragedies which overwhelm her. Louise's depression  no longer becomes an option. She forms an uneasy alliance with Ian  Donnelly (an underused Jeremy Renner), a handsome astrophysicist as  they try to decode their uninvited guests' contact and symbolic  language. Of course, they must also contend with military and  government officials who are leery of these foreign interlopers and  eager to blast them out of the skies.  Arrival plays more like a psychological mystery than a sci-fi thriller,  an intellectual debate about them vs. us. The film takes an engaging  premise and repeatedly deconstructs its plot with too much talk and too  little action. It sets up a confusing narrative structure which follows  an inconsistent non-linear set of rules that ultimately disappoints its  audience. As Louise tries to unravel this on-going mystery, the past  yields to the present in flash-backs and flash-forwards to the point of  vertigo. Time is not the moviegoer's friend in this story. It jumbles  parallel story lines awkwardly, making the dramatic personal backstory  sketchy and lacking clarity.  Instead, the movie concentrates on the alien visit and becomes a lesson  in cryptography, physics, grammar, and basic reading comprehension  skills. The film deliberately shifts from past, present, and future  parsing into the imperfect tense. Unfortunately, the film's syntax  never creates a well-formed thought, believable character, or logical  rationale. All of the film's overdone intellectualizing dooms this  mission. Its analytical theorizing is simply lost in translation. The  film is more enamored of listening to its own voice than thoroughly  explaining the plot or its outcome. In fact, the film's final twist is  completely underwhelming and unsatisfying.  Yes, there are a few assets to the film, particularly Amy Adam's fine  performance as Louise. She is the only well defined character in the  movie and the actress anchors the weightlessness of the script's banal  dialog and heavy-handed exposition. Arrival is also well crafted and  earnest to a fault. Mr. Villeneuve's visuals are solid throughout and  Johann Johannsson's dissonant music score is quite effective in adding  to the eeriness of the proceedings.  Arrival wants to ask and answer many questions about the mysteries of  our universe. But perhaps, it should start by asking itself, 'Who's on  first?' The answer being: 'I dunno.'",4,5,11,15 November 2016
Parasite," An Ongoing Metaphor About Class Struggle
","GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Brilliantly directed, Parasite is a dark satire about class warfare that burrows into your moviegoing pleasure and doesn't let go.JIM'S REVIEW: Korean director Bong Joon-ho is a very versatile talent whose work is always visionary and highly personal, but not always successful due to his penchant for overstatement. His film subjects most always deal with social issues and oppressive forces against the common man. Yet, his films can range to a host of genres, from horror film to surreal sci-fi to political satire. One cannot easily pigeonhole this director and even his lesser films which become borderline contrived, still contain powerful messages about greed, consumerism, and class struggles.Parasite may be his best film to date. It is a thrilling and complicated tale that keeps the moviegoer guessing its outcome. The film starts out as a dark comedy, then suddenly veers into pure satire before finishing its journey as a crime story. It is an exhilarating ride. Dare I say, very twisted, metaphorically speaking.The literate screenplay by Han Jin-won and co-authored by the director contrasts two Korean families: the Kims, a clan of poor grifters living in squalor in a sub-basement apartment doing menial low-paying jobs just to get by, and the Parks, an affluent and dysfunctional family that take their wealth unwisely for granted. The Kims' work their way into the Parks' lives through their lies and deceptive action, all resulting in tragic events.The script cleverly weaves The Kims' greedy scheming against the Parks' naivety and shallowness to a crescendo of mayhem and violence. The film does have one too many anti-climatic endings and needed a bit more concise storytelling for stronger impact, but Bong Joon-ho masterfully conveys his raging vision of the working class and the elite at war.The cast is wonderful. Song Kang-ho is the impoverished patriarch and Jang Hye-jin is his shrewish wife. Choi Woo-shik is their idealistic son and Park So-dam is their wily daughter. They battle Lee Sun-kyan as a haughty businessman and Cho Yeo-jeong, in a scene-stealing role, as his fragile and dim wife.Strong production values reinforce the sharp divide between the classes. Visually, the dirty and cramped cluttered apartment contrasts dramatically with the sunlit contemporary Architectural Digest prototypes created by designer Ha-jun Lee. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong lenses the two settings, lighting one home in dark umber hues and claustrophobic low angles while using bright intense lighting to imply the stark formal symmetry of the other dwelling in order to establish the imbalance of both families.Parasite is insightful and excels in its execution. Bong Joon-ho creates lasting images that correspond directly to his narratives. His film has much to say about the ongoing power struggle between those who have and those who have not. Simply put, it is one of the year's best films.",9,1,4,8 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Flying High
","This film is highly recommended. (☆☆☆☆)Remember the film, Black Swan, a surreal and visually stunning film that dealt with a dancer's descent into madness? Well, that beautiful but deadly swan has turned into an ugly duckling of sorts. That film now has been resurrected into another surreal and visually stunning film, only this time, it deals with an actor's descent into madness. The film is Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is that actor. Once a famous celebrity for his role as a comic book hero and now a zero, a mere footnote of cinema history. But he is about to stage a comeback, a play that he has written, directed and will be the featured star. That is, if he can overcome the many professional and personal obstacles when producing a Broadway show, Those hardships include: Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), a high-strung and gifted Actor (with a capital A), his Broadway co-star Leslie (Naomi Watt), Riggan's worrisome friend and producer (Zach Galifianakis), his young girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), his strung-out daughter Sam (Emma Stone), and his former wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan). As things steadily go wrong (and you know they will), Riggan's world quickly spins out of control.Much of the film is seen from Riggan's crazed point of view. We watch the madness begin to permeate his life and the absurdities and hardships seem to multiply at a rapid pace. We are taken on a journey of the mind and flow along with the film's rhythms and mood swings. That is, until Birdman's final scene, where the film becomes somewhat arbitrary and confusing. The movie's parting shot makes its ending problematic and contradicts much of what is seen before it. (If only the film could have ended a minute or two earlier, the overall result would have been more satisfying for this moviegoer.) But that being said, what a remarkable film Birdman is! This is still a special one-of-a-kind movie-going experience. It is a film of sheer audacity and bold exciting ideas. Birdman has been masterfully directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. Iñárritu takes his story (which he co-wrote with Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, and Armando Bo) and layers his film with many flourishes and unexpected turns. He structures his film and choreographs every move with marked precision. The film is stylishly made without being overdone or obvious. The director stages his film as if it is one continuous tracking shot, given the film an edgy and dreamlike vibe. Reality blend seamlessly with fantasy as one hallucination simply flows into another and what an incredible effect it all is! Kudos to Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrone for their superb editing and Emmanuel Lubezki's magnificent photography which creates the unreal world of its main character so succinctly. The film boasts some award- winning acting too.Michael Keaton is brilliant as in the title role. Birdman has a bit of the autobiographical by casting this actor, a former Batman himself and reclusive actor. It is a risk that pays off in spades. Keaton balances that perfect mix between the absurd and the real. The actor displays his comic talents most effectively and also shows the tragic side in his portrait of a man on the verge of destruction. This is a comeback breakout performance within a comeback breakdown performance.Giving Keaton ample support are a wonderful ensemble who deliver memorable comic moments, particularly Norton as his narcissistic foil and Stone as his damaged daughter. Lindsey Duncan also has a pivotal scene between critic and actor that is quite memorable.All of the artisans behind the camera, the gifted ensemble of actors, and particularly, Iñárritu's expert direction completely energize the film. Expect the unexpected in this dark comedy. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) cannot be easily ignored. This is innovative filmmaking of the highest order.

The Big Short," For a Few Dollars More
","(Rating:☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: A dark comedy that informs while it cashes in on its serious subject and sees it only for its entertainment possibilities.GRADE: BWhen I first saw the trailer for The Big Short, I thought, 'What a depressing and boring topic for a film! What possessed these filmmakers to put all their time and effort into an global event that hurt so many people financially and has them still reeling from its long-lasting effects? Nobody is going to want to see this movie! It will bomb big time!' ￼Well, I was partially right. Despite all of its critical praise, the movie is not breaking records at the box office. The subject of our economic collapse as a nation is more gruesome and messier than any Tarantino blood-fest, far more realistic and deadly. Moviegoers are staying away in droves. But the film is sharp, witty, and informative, that I must admit, so on that count, the filmmakers were absolutely right. The subject needs our attention...and fast! While The Big Short does have some difficult plotting issues that are hard to comprehend, the film succeeds with its imaginative retelling of the financial meltdown of the world market.Swaps, synthetic stock options, CDO equity...it's like speaking a foreign language, and I must admit, I still don't understand most of the economic jargon, even after the film tries to dumb down the financial rhetoric in the cleverest of ways by using celebrities to simplify the actions on the screen. Appearances by Margot Robbie discussing stock trading in a bubble bath, Anthony Bourdain cooking day-old leftovers, and Selena Gomez at the gambling tables of Vegas are wonderful parodies that help explain the global crisis that befell us in 2008. (I wish these smart distracting 'short' infomercials were used more often throughout the film as the topic of stock market trading is a dry discussion point.)￼Solidly directed by Adam McKay, The Big Short takes its serious theme and analyzes the repercussions of the 'Greed is good' mentality that permeated Wall Street then (and now) by focusing on four central players and their roles in masterminding this international Ponzi scheme. The casting of this quartet of stockbrokers is marvelous. Christian Bale plays Michael Burry, a frantic man-child genius, better equipped to deal with numbers than people. Ryan Gosling is Jared Vennett, a slick money broker who discovers the housing market bubble to his advantage. Brad Pitt adds more interest as Ben Rickert, a jaded former stock broker who distrusts banks and businesses. Especially effective is Steve Carell. The actor portrays a fictional Mark Blum, and walks the fine dramatic line between anger and guilt in his skillful interpretation of one of the few businessmen with a conscience. Fine supporting performances are given by Finn Wittrock, John Magaro, Hamish Linklater, Rafe Spall, and Jeremy Strong in smaller but pivotal roles.￼Special mention goes out to the rapid-fire editing by Hank Corwin, whose quick cuts of images add a stylish pop quality to the proceedings and an intelligent screenplay by Charles Randolph and the director establishes its despicable well drawn characters and makes them surprisingly compelling and likable. Everyone of these corporate high rollers is in it for the money and makes a profit on everyone else's misery and financial downfall, but we moviegoers are caught up in their illegal shell game, a plan that doomed the housing market and crippled the banks and mortgage companies worldwide.￼The Big Short is well made and compelling, although its script still was unable to clearly elaborate the complexities of its topic. The film settles for the smaller picture, a behind-the- scenes look at the traders and their game, rather than delve into the larger ripple effects that created financial ruin to many families caught in the mortgage debacle. That aspect is glossed over rather quickly. But the film does serve not only as a reminder of what was, but also a warning of what may come...once again.

The Conjuring," Who Ya Gonna Call!
","This film is recommended.Who doesn't like a good scary ghost story now and then? One that delivers goosebumps or makes us jump with every dreaded bump in the night. The Conjuring miraculously reappears from that old fashion haunted house movie staple of the past before disappearing into the haze of formulaic set-ups updated for today's movie-going audiences. The film toys with our fears of the unknown, wisely keeps the horror hidden for our own imaginations to work overtime, and plays with our own insecurities and foibles.The obvious story may sound all so familiar, but the filmmaking isn't. James Wan skillfully directs this supernatural horror film which (of course) is based on supposedly true events. The film relies heavily on our past experiences as moviegoers as it successfully mixes our cinematic memories of Poltergeist, The Haunting, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, Child's Play and other films of this genre with more recent offerings like The Blair Witch Project, Insidious, and the Paranormal Activity series. (By the way, Wan directed Insidious so he's had some practice with eerie sound effects and quick edits. He also directed Saw but he shrewdly downplays any gore and sex with this outing. It's R-rating is a bit surprising as most of the violence is suggestive and not overt.) Special kudos also go out to Wan's long-time collaborator and cinematographer John R. Leonetti for his atmospheric imagery and powerful use of lighting and shadows.The plot: It's 1971. Carolyn and Roger Perrone (Lilli Palmer and Ron Livingston) are the proud parents of five wonderful daughters and a 17th century farmhouse listed at a ridiculously low price. Needless to say the Perrone clan is one excited and happy family until mysterious goings-on go on. Terrorized by evil forces, The Perrones are unable to leave due to economic hardships (an apt touch with today's housing market woes). Who they gonna call? Help is soon on the way in the form of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), seekers of the paranormal. These ghost-hunters believe the family's story and will help rid the house of demons and bad spirits.Written by Chad and Carey Hayes, The Conjuring avoids most of the pitfalls of so many previous horror tales. The film tries to remain credible by having its characters make logical choices for the most part and still create some tension and suspense before descending into full supernatural hyperbole. The film also tries to keep a serious tone throughout all the strange occurrences, casting credence wherever it can. The Conjuring purports to be based on actual activities documented in a case study by the real-life Warrens, although the fanciful prologue never quite gels with the rest of the film and the sound effects are all too obvious. However, the strong cast, especially Wilson and Farmiga as the paranormal investigators, help to elevate the familiar story and bring with them an air of believability. The setting, with its 70's pop score and details in its art direction, creates a period flavor that lends an authenticity and legitimizes the reality of the ghostly activity that propagated during that era.The Conjuring is an extremely well-made supernatural ghost story that more than delivers the thrills and chills one expects from this genre. The filmmakers are indeed completely possessed, fortunately, with the right amount of talent and enough style to conjure up a nifty little tale of horror that today's moviegoers can truly enjoy.

Prometheus," For Sci-Fi: 10, For Scares: 3
","This film is recommended.Originally, in Greek mythology, Prometheus was a deity who helped mankind and was later punished by Zeus for his actions. ( Perhaps some fava beans and a nice chianti might have sufficed. ) His quest for scientific knowledge had its own share of risks. In Ridley Scott's latest sci-fi epic, Prometheus, a ' prequel ' to his Alien film series, the director takes his own share of risks as he again goes into this genre, using his mythological DNA as his guide. This time Prometheus is the name of the spacecraft that transports a team of explorers as they go on a journey to find the origins of mankind after an archaeological discovery of artifacts spurs their interests. Instead, they find other hostile lifeforms and enough terror to easily fill two hours in this visually stunning spectacle. Scott's eagerly awaited and totally over-hyped film has its share of limitations too. Unfortunately, his latest venture simply cannot avoid comparisons to his classic predecessors, Alien or its sequel, Aliens, which are well-deserved classic films of the sci-fi / horror genre. This film never rises to that level of superiority, mainly due to its underwritten characters lost in a formulaic script that seems too caught up in the sci-fi plot mechanics while underplaying the horror film strands. Prometheus is a heady experience, but it rarely allows its characters to emerge with any semblance to real people and the film is in dire need of more scary moments to build to a satisfying climax for its movie-going audience. However, Prometheus is still worth the trip, if only for its sumptuous art direction by Arthur Max ( widely inspired by the works of H.R. Giger ), its eye-popping CGI, and a delightful performance by Michael Fassbender as David, an android with some HAL 9000 traits and a strong admiration and physical resemblance to a young Peter O'Toole. With atmospheric cinematography by Dariusz Wolski, tension-filled editing by Pietro Scalia, and wonderful use of 3-D holograms creating the illusion of depth of field projections, the film fascinates on a strictly visceral level.The year is 2093. And surprise...we are not alone! Onboard the spacecraft are our feisty heroine, Elizabeth Shaw ( Noomi Rapace ), his boyfriend Charlie ( Logan Marshall-Green ), a no-nonsense captain named Janek ( Idris Elba ), a businesslike woman aptly named Meredith Vickers ( an underused Charlize Theron ), and the aforementioned David ( Fassbender ), plus other crew members whose sole purpose is to become the main entrée. Of course, these supposedly intelligent adventurers will make foolish and illogical decisions as they go quietly to their doom. We know that they will be systemically picked off, one-by-one, as they encounter these foreign enemies. That's part of the genre, I guess. But does it always have to be that way? The script, by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof ( of Lost fame ), is a bit of a muddle with its existential ideology, its faith vs. science arguments, and its heavy-handed motives of evil big business and capitalistic greed rearing its ugly head yet again. In fact, some of the characters' actions are never really sufficiently explained. The film tries to integrate these deeper issues with little success. After all, this film is suppose to be an action-packed sci-fi horror creature feature, isn't it? So why dress it up to be something more than it is? More separation of church and state-of-the-arts would have made an more satisfying film experience for its target audience of teenagers and sci-fi aficionados and kept the adrenaline rush at a feverish pace. Still, there are plenty of thrills, if not genuine scares galore with the gore factor prominently in full view. ( It may not rival John Hurt's stomach popping scene in the original film, but there is one memorable moment that elicited enough squirms and audible groans from audience members, including myself. ) While Prometheus may not be the classic sci-fi fantasy film it strives to be, the film is undoubtedly a technical triumph for Scott and a fine example of stylish filmmaking from a cinematic master at work.

Wonder Woman," Let's Hear It for the Girls!
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Another superhero movie with some style and a willingness to establish its characters first and let the action follow.SYNOPSIS: The legend of Wonder Woman and a new film franchise is born.JIM'S REVIEW: Wonder Woman (2017) owes so much of its success to two women, one in front of the camera and one behind the lens. Their contributions make this the first of many entries into a profitable future film series. Gal Gadot play Princess Diana, daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, and she is perfectly cast as our Amazon warrior. She is terrific in this role. The Israeli actress has star power personified and she also displays some nice comic timing too. Patty Jenkins, her director, does a remarkable job of focusing on the human story while staging the action sequence with real flair. She does not sacrifice the hand-to-hand combat expected in this type of movie and plays up the relationship between the goddess and the mortal.That mortal is Steve Trevor, played winningly by Chris Pine. This charming actor can play the dashing hero and WWI aviator without much challenge, but he brings along with him a sweet vulnerability and slight goofiness that makes his character endearing. The chemistry between him and Ms. Gadot, dare I say, makes this film work wonders and elevates it above the rest of the stereotypical DC or Marvel universe of superheroes.The screenplay by Allan Heinberg establishes the action scenes amid more quieter moments that fortify the relationship of the mismatched lovers. It creates a strong role model and allows Diana to play the role of a stranger in a strange land, that place being WWI Germany. As she comes to terms with the cruelty of war and mankind's choices to perpetuate this violence, the film makes its heavy-handed message, at least, more intriguing. Unfortunately Wonder Woman's golden lariat can break free of the standard formula of the comic book superhero genre, beginning with the mythological origins of our heroine and ending in a typical slam-bang showdown of overproduced CGI. Fortunately, in between, is that tender love story that ropes in the moviegoer's interest.Supporting characters never achieve much depth. The bad guys are so obvious (even a twist here and there, lacked an element of surprise). The good guys are stock misfits that aren't given much to do. Still, Danny Huston, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis and Lucy Davis bring some needed class to the movie. Ms. Jenkins has created a well crafted film and, unlike so many of the recent action flicks, stages the battle scenes clearly. Thankfully, there is little upfront close-ups and jittery camera moves. (Credit goes to cinematographer Matthew Jensen as well.) One can actually see the action, a rarity with action-fantasy blockbusters these days. Especially effective is her vision of Diana's war in No-Man's Land set piece, the film's highlight. (Although it seems more realistic to conclude that Diana's form-fitting WW outfit and bare skin may have unified the Allied forces more than her warrior skills leading them to victory.) entertainsWonder Woman may not be very original or ground-breaking, but it does enable women to take the reins in the usually all-male dominating world of filmmaking and deliver one of the better comic book superhero blockbuster in quite a long time.

Marriage Story," Where Love Has Gone
","GRADE: ATHIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A searing indictment about divorce that devastates in the subtlest of ways.
JIM'S REVIEW: I openly wept at the conclusion of Noah Baumbach's deeply disturbing Marriage Story, a lacerating portrait of love lost. This highly personal account of divorce ranks among the best films of this or any year.Mr. Baumbach creates a story about two good but wounded people that is raw in its emotion and brutally honest in its treatment. There are so many small intimate moments throughout this gripping film with which one can easily identify to so many couples who lives suddenly take different paths. Such is the case of Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie Barber (Adam Driver), two successful New York theater types who seem to be going through the paces of their marriage.The film begins brilliantly with voiceover narration and shared glimpses of happier times with the Barber family. We hear each of the couple's loving words about each character's positive traits, although Nicole is unwillingly to state her feelings aloud. Their marital troubles intensify when she decides to leave Charlie's theater company and moves to Los Angeles for an acting gig in a television pilot, taking their eight year old son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), with her while Charlie stays in New York to ready his Broadway directorial debut. Their bicoastal relationship quickly dissolves. Like so many well-intentioned couples, their aim is to split amicably, but they helplessly free-fall into a biased legal system that systematically destroy the lives of families already in pain.This is Mr. Baumbach's finest film to date. His resume is growing more and more impressive. His direction here is flawless and his screenplay is even more impressive in its well-played words and somewhat cruel actions. As screenwriter, he does stack the deck slightly against Nicole and her possible manipulation of their situation and allows Charlie to automatically become a tragic victim of circumstances. But that is a minor issue in Mr. Baumbach's concise and insightful storytelling. His tale of marriage and its flip side is mesmerizing. This all builds to a gut-wrenching confrontation scene between the warring couple that is the film's highlight (or perhaps lowlight just might be a better term). The overall effect of their marital loss ranks with some of the best films about divorce ever made. Family-based dramas like Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, Robert Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer, or Stanley Donan's Two for the Road come to mind.The ensemble is exceptional. Laura Dern plays Nora Farshaw, Nicole's barracuda of a divorce lawyer. Her performance is spot-on and she delivers a wild and cynical view of life, especially in her overt rant about motherhood that is simultaneously funny and very sad. Alan Alda and Ray Liotta skillfully depict two versions of L.A. divorce lawyers that show the inter trappings of the law system so perversely accurate. Julie Hagerty and Marritt Weaver play Nicole's mother and sister and they both offer solid support in their smaller roles. As the Barber's son, young Mr. Robertson delivers a natural and compelling performance as a confused and angry child caught in his parent's battle for control.But it is Ms. Johansson and Mr. Driver who ground the film with all their blistering pain and rage. Their acting is simply superb. In the more difficult role, Ms. Johansson portrays a woman thwarted by her life choices and yearning for more. At times, her character must be vulnerable or selfish and the actress is unafraid to show Nicole's uglier side. It is a fearless performance. Mr. Driver's Charlie goes through more of a metamorphosis and his arc is extremely moving. The actor shows his character's frustration, his insatiable need for self expression at the cost of wife's need for equality, and his ongoing inability to connect his feelings with her demands. He is outstanding. Both actors deliver their best performances in their already established careers which should be remembered this award season.Bad things do happen to good people and Marriage Story is that poignant love story worth retelling. This thought provoking film concludes full circle in two bittersweet scenes that reveal the cost of love and the tragedy of a failed marriage. Mr. Baumbach and company deserve all the accolades for their powerful cinematic statement. Marriage Story is one of the year's best dramas. By all means, go! And bring your tissues with you.",10,5,8,8 December 2019
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Up...One of the Year's Best
","(Rating: ☆☆☆½ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: The film doesn't play straight with the facts but it is superior filmmaking.GRADE: B+Now I should say straight out that rap music is not my particular inclination when I want to hear some songs. (Honestly, I'm more a Broadway show tunes and R & B type of listener.) With that in mind, I went to see this movie with some trepidation and found it to be involving and yet riveting in a detached way. And boy, did I feel old watching Straight Out of Compton. Resembling a wannabe Barbara Billingsley jive lady, I felt out of sync with the rhythm and rhyme, a genuine generational relic ready for the scrapheap of life. Let me state upfront that the film does have its flaws: All of the characters and their attitudes in this film were an unpleasant lot, off-putting and repellent people with very little remorse for their actions or possessing any redeeming values other than their passion for their art. The film also takes its subtle glorification of these real life boyz-from-the-hood and their pro-drug life-styles to some exaggerated heights without showing the ramifications of their actions, which I found slightly disturbing. But the film's many assets outweigh some minor missteps along the way.Straight Out of Compton takes place in 1986 and shows the origins of the hip hop music industry. It's the beginnings of gangsta rap, with lyrics laced with profanity and urging violence acts against the establishment, specifically any symbol of authority be it the police or any embodiment of law enforcement. A group of street-wise musicians broke new ground with their unique brand of music that is all too commonplace today. The group was called N.W.A., formed by three friends: Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr, Ice Cube's real son), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell). and this biopic depicts their rise to fame amid adverse conditions, many caused by their own making.While the film paints an incomplete picture of true events and its facts are somewhat skewed, it remains a powerful look into a time when revolution and unrest became part of the mainstream. The film never truly delve into the darker side of these performers and their complicated lives, skimming across some of their more violent acts and anti-social behaviors. The historical accuracy is a bit lax with misogyny and homophobia present in the storytelling but downplayed in this film, especially in the case of Dr. Dre's record of abuse toward women. (Perhaps the reason may lie with two of the film's producers, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre themselves who could only go so far as to depict the real story behind the music which diminishes the film's real impact. The truth obviously could not set them free. It also plays fast and loose with the pivotal roles of MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) and their contribution's to N.W.A.'s mega-hit status. (A sixth member of the group, Arabian Prince, is not even mentioned.)That said, the movie is expertly directed by F. Gary Gray. The direction keeps the action moving at a brisk and showy pace. He encompasses his narrative with a vital raw energy and much cinematic style, successfully incorporating the music within its plot. Many of the incidents shown on the screen are fascinating to watch without emotionally connecting to this moviegoer.The screenplay by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff is literate and riveting while loosely based on the facts. They create believable characters and capture in their dialog the street jargon with much authenticity and bravado. As the group begins to splinter, so does the film in its third act. Still it is strong dramatic fodder as it takes these real life characters and makes their roles bigger-than-life, giving the performers plenty of opportunities to showcase their musical talents and acting abilities. The casting is very strong throughout the film. Particularly outstanding are the three leads who all give break-out performances, especially Jason Mitchell as the trusting member of the group. R. Marcos Taylor plays Suge Knight as pure evil and Paul Giamatti plays their ambitious and shady manager, Jerry Heller, and makes his interpretation of a predictable role even more intriguing.Did the film make me appreciate the world of gangsta rap more? No. But I was enraptured by the cast and its talented director. Straight Out of Compton is a well-crafted film and worthwhile viewing, especially for seriously-minded film-goers and fans of this musical genre. It deserves many of the accolades it is presently earning. Straight up, this film is one of the year's best.",9,10,42,7 September 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," 50 Ways to Bruise Your Lover
","This film is not recommended. (Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)In brief: 50 ways to bruise your lover...and an audience as well.GRADE: CFloggers ready...it's time to beat a dead horse! 50 Shades of Grey has arrived, a guilty pleasure that quickly becomes a guiltless displeasure.But first, let me digress...Years ago, my sweet elderly mother drove out-of-town to see the racy Saturday Night Fever, a popular R-rated film. Her desire to see this film proved greater than her actual enjoyment but, at least, she was able to experience it first hand and no one she knew would know her dirty little secret. Her reputation remained purloined and intact. I bring this up as that film was nearly forty years ago and not much has changed with the latest sexual romp being Fifty Shades of Grey. The beat (or the beatings) goes on, even with its wall-to-wall contemporary pop soundtrack.￼We now return to our regular scheduled review: Fifty Shades of Grey is a dull boring affair. The sex on screen is strictly rote, badly wrote. Most of this carnal action has been seen countless times in other sex films. You know the routine: quick cuts of breasts, rears, and even quicker glimpses of genitalia interspersed with arched backs and stylized poses in various states of undress, all looking for unattainable ecstasy. The sex is sanitized for the masses. After all, it has a R-rating. It's the softest of soft porn.Fifty Shades of Grey celebrates sexual diversity while condemning that sexual choice with Puritan fanaticism. It's smug, condescending, and pure fantasy. The filmmakers plays both sides hoping men can relate to that male dominance angle while women can empathize with their sensual desires. (I won't get into the debate of degrading women or the issue of sexual domination and violence. This film degrades mankind in its silly treatment and romantic disillusion of pleasure and pain.) ￼James Dornan and Dakota Johnson play the mismatched lovers, Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. Grey is handsome, sexy, and rich. He is 'the world's most eligible billionaire bachelor'. Ana is a young awkward and naive virgin, ready to be plucked and educated in the fine art of lovemaking. They stare longingly at each other. They breathe heavily and talk dirty. They strip down often, moping more than groping. The endless droning and groaning at the height of their sexual passions is repeated often between their trips to the infamous 'red' room, a private boudoir filled with the all of the latest S&M equipment that money can buy. Ana continually bites her lips. Christian plays the piano whenever he needs a Zen moment since he never can crack a smile. He showers his pretty woman with expensive gifts and demands of obedience. She complies. And so it goes. On and on. Their mating dance becomes downright laughable. and their dialog is just awful. The actors are so intense and deadly serious, uttering this nonsense with every spoken sentence ending in large exclamation points. Both Mr. Dorman and Ms. Johnson are physically attractive performers, but their acting never rises to any level of reality. That they were able to say their lines with the straightest of faces, at least, shows some acting restraint. (I wish them all the luck in the future with more challenging roles than these one-dimensional characters allow.) ￼The director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, does an adequate job, but she seems as obsessed with the excesses of Mr. Grey's vast empire as our darling Anastasia. This is a big budget picture after all, even if there is no real money shot. The director carefully places her camera strategically out of view of any male frontal views. (But there is still a fleeting glimpse of Ms. Johnson's private area that goes pubic, I mean public. So much for woman's liberation.) As Mr. Grey so eloquently states at one point in the movie, 'I'm fifty shades of f**ked up.' So is this movie.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4,2,5,24 February 2015
The Wolverine," A Wolf (Six) Pack
","This film is mildly recommended.The Wolfman is back, all ripped abs and muscles bulging, with hirsute chest and hands of steel and a hot-blooded temper to match. Marvel's favorite mutant, Wolverine, takes center stage again in his second solo feature, aptly titled The Wolverine, an action adventure movie that is strong on action but not very adventurous in its story. The film clearly follows a tried and true formula and rarely breaks away from it, although there is a nice twist toward the end of the film.James Mangold directs this installment with mixed results, mostly positive. The director competently stages the set pieces with enough excitement and energy, although some of the filming and editing is far too close-up and, pardon the pun, choppy. Some of the CGI is highly effective, like a wonderful chase sequence aboard a fast-moving train (the film's best scene). But at times, the visual effects completely miss the mark, as in an earlier sequence involving the more noticeable appearance of an artificial looking bear that could give Yogi some competition. The director also tries to build some character development and complicated plotting in his film which is rare for this type of genre. Unfortunately, the screenplay and dialog by Mark Bombard and Scott Frank never really connects with the goings-on and chases.The plot goes something like this: Wolverine is all angst-ridden and is summoned to visit a Japanese ex-soldier whose life he once saved. It is there that Wolverine is asked to protect his granddaughter, Mariko, from harm as he fights the Yakuza and other sinister forces, even though our superhero is beginning to show signs of weakening power and mortality. Of course, without Hugh Jackman perfectly cast as its superhero, there could not be a viable franchise. The actor is such a valuable commodity and the main reason for viewing this film. (There are certainly plenty of opportunities to see Jackman shirtless or in the buff and the filmmakers have enough gratuitous shots to please his doting admirers, both male and female alike. There are also enough action sequences to satisfy comic book aficionados as well.) Jackman invests in this role and his commanding presence gives the film some plausibility.Yet it's the down time in between the action sequences that tend to slow down the film a bit. Characters are introduced without any real definition and their motives and actions seems suspect or they appear evil from the start with no credible explanation. (Any savvy moviegoer will know one of the villains is a walking stereotype, obviously bad from the onset due to her coiffure and stylish appearance.)The actors play their parts earnestly and it's refreshing to see that the movie was filmed on location in Japan and utilized native actors for the roles. Tao Okamoto is Mariko and Rila Fukushima plays Wolverine's martial arts sidekick. Both actresses efficiently deliver the necessary drama to the proceedings and have a fine chemistry with Jackman throughout the film. The Wolverine doesn't bite off more than it can chew. It's well-made, entertaining, yet nondescript. It is again just another one of the many comic book movies that we've seen countless times before. The movie left me wanting more. My expectations were higher and I was still...hungry...like a wolf, for a more satisfying movie-going experience that The Wolverine never accomplished for me. GRADE: B-NOTE: The PG-13 rating seems off the mark too with so much blood, violence, and profanity on display. Wolverine must have used his special powers to avoid the film's much deserved R- rating. Just another example of this archaic, subjective, and ineffective rating system of ours.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,0,1,10 August 2013
Win Win," An All Too Winning Formula
","Name the film: A well-to-do Southern family takes in a homeless  teenager. His talent in football and the love of a family lead him to a  better life in this heartwarming and uplifting crowd-pleaser. ( I hope  I didn't blindside you with the obviousness of my clues.)  Now, let's follow that same formula with a few changes in tow. Name  this film: A well-to-do ( middle class ) Southern ( New Jersey ) family  takes in a homeless teenager. His talent in football ( wrestling ) and  the love of a family lead him to a better life in this heartwarming and  uplifting crowd-pleaser.  The answer: Win Win, the latest independent film written and directed  by Thomas McCarthy ( The Visitor, The Station Agent ) follows the  Flaherty family, an average all-American family who are trying to eke  out a living in today's economy. Mike ( Paul Giamatti ) is a small town  lawyer and Jackie ( Amy Ryan ) is his loyal loving wife. Also part of  this slightly clichéd family unit are two cute little girls, but, alas,  no dog! Mike finds an aimless young boy at the doorstep of an elderly  client and gives him a place to stay. The boy, Kyle, is the silent  brooding type, a loner who has had a hard-knock life. Escaping his  drug-addicted mother ( Melanie Lynskey ), he begins to befriend this  family and build a more positive self-image through his wrestling  skills. Oh, yes, Mike is also the high school wrestling coach, hence  the title.  This low key film has a very slow start, introducing minor characters  as comic relief which does nothing to advance the storyline. It's not  until the character of Kyle enters the film that the plot begins to  cohere. That bond is due to the fine acting of newcomer Alex Shaffer  who is perfectly cast in that role and Giamatti as his adoptive father  figure. In fact, all of the acting has a genuine honest sincerity that  helps the film tremendously avoid the pitfalls of sentimentality and  mawkishness.   McCarthy wisely sidesteps those obvious moments with his well written  screenplay, giving the film's characters depth and nuance with his  artful way with conversational dialogue. Even though its familiar plot  structure follows the tried-and-true win-winning formula of other  feel-good films of this genre, Win Win is an entertaining enough film  that benefits from its talented cast and its interesting characters.  And when you tally it all up, that still makes it a win-win situation  for any moviegoer. GRADE: B-",6,8,16,17 April 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," What Goes Up...
","This film is recommended.All the doom, gloom, and high energy action sequences are back in the conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. When we last left our caped crusader in the far superior second installment, The Dark Knight, he was the most conflicted of all anti-heroes. In this latest reincarnation, he remains that most conflicted and angst- ridden anti-hero whom moviegoers still worship and adore. Some prior knowledge is in order as we begin this final chapter: Eight years ago, Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman ( Christian Bale ) was falsely accused of murdering District Attorney, Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face. That former White Knight is now considered a national hero while our Dark Knight has become a fugitive of the law. Gotham City has been surprisingly crime-free, all under the protective eye of Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ). A mopey and despondent billionaire playboy is under the care of his loyal butler, Alfred ( well played by Michael Caine ). His services no longer needed, Mr. Wayne has stowed away in the mansion all these years until his beloved city calls him back into duty along with that sporty new Batmobile and Batcycle gizmo accessories supplied by the innovative Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ).Enter the mysterious and psychotic villain...Bane, who name seems to be doing more harm than his actions these days. Bane, a muscle-head type garbed in Mad Max and Hannibal Lecter retro chic, wants to destroy the city by first destroying its financial infrastructure and then blowing up a football game which would get its citizens even more riled up. His motives and methods are unclear and his scheming not very clever ( and none of it makes any real sense by the film's conclusion either ).This villain seems one-dimensional, an enigma so glum and serious, so dark and uninspiring, lacking anything redeeming for the moviegoer to relish and enjoy. He's all about inherent evil, all black and rotting, with no shades of gray in between. While there is a great deal of menace to the character, there is no real sense of humor or wit. As the role is written and acted by Tom Hardy, whose dialog is, at times, unintelligible, it pales in comparison with Ledger's brilliant turn as the Joker. The costume itself may play to the back row but it physically muzzles the performance within. Perhaps, lessons on screen villainy and proper diction should have be administered by Professor Darth Vader. As it is, this is one of the weakest nemesis in years, and without that bad guy taking center stage, our good guy is fighting a minor skirmish with no genuine excitement. All that this Batman's foe turns out to be is a brutish thug with an overabundance of brawn and not much in the brain department.Now, the film's director, the talented Christopher Nolan, does know how to effectively stage his set pieces to maximum effect and he choreographs the stunts and actions with much finesse, except for an overly long boxing match between the arch-rivals that lacks any exhilaration. It is a bit of a slugfest, sluggishly filmed. The film also loses a lot of momentum and adrenaline drive as our hero ( and the director ) simultaneously take their story in a direction that sacrifices logic at the midway point of the film. It is at this point that the film becomes so deadly serious and goes politically awry with its belabored Occupy Wall Street protests and French Revolutionary mentality, as does Christian Bale's interpretation of Batman, making him such a tortured, earnest, yet awfully dull lost soul.Nolan adroitly adds some interesting new characters to this final installment: a dedicated young policemen named Blake ( a totally engaging Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) and another love interest for our hero named Miranda Tate ( Marion Cotillard ), a bewitching millionairess. And speaking of bewitching, Nolan re-introduces Bruce's purr-fic arch-rival, Selina a.k.a. Catwoman ( Anne Hathaway, stealing the film, with a mere wave of her claws ). The addition of this character into his series invigorates the film and complicates matters, adding some touches of needed humor. There are moments in The Dark Knight Rises where Nolan's bright vision continues to shine through the shrouded darkness of a muddled story written by him and his brother, Jonathan ( i.e., the opening scenes of an aerial escape that rivals any stunt work in the James Bond franchise, his subtle use of The Star Spangled Banner as background music signaling the doom to come, the tension-filled terroristic assault and takeover of the Stock Exchange ). Yet all the nifty twists and reveals do little to build much suspense, even though Hans Zimmer's bombastic music score tries to singlehandedly signaled what the visual images should convincingly do on their own accord. The Dark Knight Rises is a more than adequate send-off to one of Hollywood's more profitable trilogies. It entertains and satisfies. It has some thrilling sequences amid all the sound and needless fury. It gives the movie audience what it wants, an efficient action fantasy, but it never transcends the limits of its own hero's legendary vision or that of its gifted director. The Dark Knight Rises does, more often than not, rise to the occasion, but it stays too grounded in its own grim reality to truly let itself go.

The Croods," Another Modern Stone Age Family
","This film is recommended. The Croods is the perfect example of what is right and what is wrong with the work coming from today's animation studios: stunning visuals and a so-so story.The film begins with a wonderful chase sequence that utilizes the best in state-of-the-art computer animation: fluid movement, strong details, and vivid colors. It always entertains in telling its tale of a prehistoric family and their struggles to survive the end of the world. But its predictability and overall cuteness wears thin. Characters are more caricatures and sketchy stereotypes of a typical family: Grug the domineering father,  Ugga the loving mother, Eep the rebellious teenage daughter, Thunk the lunkhead brother, Sandy the pesky youngest sibling, and Gran the dotty grandma.Once their man-cave is destroyed, they are off on an adventure as they explore the new world disorder. With their journey comes unique surreal creatures and vibrant environments and, of course, a love story as Eep meets that special guy named Guy. But the emphasis is on action, with little time on character development and too much time being spent on each dangerous encounter, followed by another, and then yet another.Yes, there's lots of running around, avoiding the various exciting obstacles in their way. Interest never lags. Fine voice-over work by Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, and Cloris Leachman add to the fun. The images throughout the film are quite impressive. Were that the thin story would rise to the caliber of visual excellence by its creative team.Still, any animation fan should see this film for its visual strengths and some sly humor that punctuates this adventure saga. Written and directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders, The Croods is diverting entertainment that the whole family, especially the young pesky ones, will completely enjoy.

Black Panther," Black Superhero Lives Matter
","GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Black lives really matter in this well-made movie, but it is hardly the ground-breaking innovative pop entertainment that one expects after all of the hype.JIM'S REVIEW: The reviews are in for Ryan Coogler's Black Panther and they have been glowing...'A cultural phenomenon'...'A monumental achievement in filmmaking'...So is all of the hoopla justified or is this film simply a well-made example of a crowd-pleasing comic book action hero movie? Obviously, my opinion won't change any moviegoer's viewpoint as the film is on its way to be one of the highest-grossing films of the year. But review it I will...Black Panther does follow the formula of most superhero movies: establish its hero and villain, build the conflict between them while laying out the mythology and origins, and creates endless CGI battles. The difference here is its predominantly African-American cast and crew overtly celebrating its own cultural heritage. The film also takes its time to delineate its supporting characters and make them fully-rounded individuals of merit. Kudos to that, and its message of social and political conscience found within its story.The film firmly celebrates racial and gender equity in its depiction of an utopian universe called Wakanda. This isolationist African nation is a technically advanced place with a peace-loving population of various tribes who have no interest in being included with the outside world and its troubles. They purposely make their country's appearance as an impoverished third world country to our real world. But beneath its surface, there is a secret powerful substance called vibranium that protects this Kwanzaa territory and makes their Lion King into a Black Panther who will reign supreme. That is, until evil forces discover this metal for weaponry and corrupt power.Yes, the basic set-up of superhero versus super villain remains intact and much of the film's beginnings are, while compelling, still long exposition posing as a story. Our hero is T' Chaka (a fine Chadwick Boseman) who is in love with a very independent woman named Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o, ever so classy). T'Chalka (a.k.a. Black Panther) becomes king and must stop the outside world from getting their stash of vibranium at all costs. Helping him is Okoye (a terrific Danai Gurira), a fearless female warrior, and her Amazonian army of bodyguards. This film uses women power to the max, another timely positive touch in this MeToo state-of-the-world mindset.Mr. Coogler directs with skill and confidence. His debut film, Fruitvale Station, an under-appreciated crime film, showed a new talent to behold, and his second feature, Creed, established a director with an unique vision. This film, his third, shows a visionary craftsman that stages his action scenes with flair, especially his climactic battle on land and in air. His deft hand elevates this film from standard superhero mode to a film of importance and authority.However, one wishes the screenplay by Joe Robert Cole and the director would have been more adventurous in breaking out of the standard issue formula found in this fantasy genre. It does, at one point, venture out and begins to resemble more of a spy homage to James Bond, complete with fast cars and gadgetry, but then it goes safely back to comic book land and gets lost in its overindulgence of CGI effects, some of which are too noticeably fake.As written, our hero is rather a bland crusader whose supporting army of warriors are far more interesting than the main character himself. The world and characters spinning around him is a more exciting bunch. As with most action flicks, it must be the villains who have the necessary know-how to engage the audience. And in Black Panther, we have, not one, but two evil forces that are great foils. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue is the antithesis of sinister evil as a black market arms dealer and makes a lasting impression, but stealing the film is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, one of the most memorable villains since Heath Ledger's Joker. Mr. Jordan is dynamic as the vengeful rival wanting to seize the throne. He brings a street-wise edginess to the narrative very convincingly and is able to give his complex character a tragic side as well, no easy feat.Rounding out the cast are such talented performers as Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, John Kani, and Daniel Kaluuya. Also giving great support are British actors Martin Freeman as a C.I.A. agent (with a perfect American accent too) and Letitia Wright in a breakout performance as T'Challa's savvy sister, Shuri.At the risk of sounding too kumbaya, Black Panther has its flaws, but it is a rollicking good time. It doesn't break any new cinematic frontier as one is led to expect by the critical hosannas, nor does it redefine film history (except for the fact that the film industry has now discovered a black audience's willingness to pay green). But as entertainment goes, the movie repeatedly scores...and that's no easy feat either.",8,3,17,25 February 2018
Mother!," Mother Load
","(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A familiar horror genre formula that is given a high class treatment, even if the bizarre script makes no logical sense whatever. SYNOPSIS: A psychological thriller in which a couple deals with strange goings-on.Darren Aronofsky's mother! is a film that comes with no capital letter, an exclamation point to inform moviegoers that there will be much emotional tension, and a whole lot of surreal Biblical images with which to contend. Too derivative of Rosemary's Baby to be called original. the film does follow that formula of a damsel-in-distress horror movie with dark psychological tones. It does showcase some fine acting, strong production values, and intense visuals, but it is real miss, as movies go...and a mess too.While the film has been called thought-provoking and disturbing by some critics, the only thought it provoked from me was, 'How can this film make any sense to anyone unless it's a really a dream / nightmare? The characters' behaviors are so bizarre, the time frame confusing, violent actions have no repercussions, and the outrageous plot leaps, no,...vaults over, any logical sense of reality.' No, I won't divulge the actual answer to that question, if you indeed make it to the end of this overwrought exercise in filmmaking, but instead I will add another thought, 'Did anyone involved in this movie stop and say to the director that his screenplay is laughable rather than scary and so over-the-top it strains credibility? Couldn't anyone say no to this dumb script?'An opening scene provides a short prologue that makes one wonder about the film's meandering plot almost immediately. We meet our soon-to-be victim and soon-to-be mother (Jennifer Lawrence), hence the title. Nothing seems right from the outset. Everyone around her is automatically suspicious or seems to have ulterior motives, including her poet husband, unnamed in the script. He is played with (possible) customary menace by Javier Bardem. The duo seem the oddest of couples right from the start: she, being his supportive obedient muse, and he, the tortured artist type. They buy a secluded country home far away from neighbors (always the first mistake in this genre), although it seems that everyone materializes out of nowhere and is stopping by this depot on a regular basis: First a stranger/ literary fan (Ed Harris) visits and is conveniently invited to stay the night, followed by his shrewish wife (a scene stealing Michelle Pfeiffer). Next comes their two gonzo sons (substitute Cain and Abel, played by Domhnall and Brian Gleeson), and then an array of hundreds of others drop-in. (I'm not exaggerating, trust me.)￼mother! is a psychological horror genre film seen as ART, all in capitals. The film mixes nightmarish suspense, due to the director's strong vision. Even if the story is very lightweight and a tad pretentious, the overall result is still visually effective. (You know that you are suppose to be experiencing 'high art' when the characters are named Him, Her, Man Woman.) But the film cannot camouflage its base origins as a typical horror film all gussied up to create those bumps in the night (which never materialize) and wallow in its shock appeal. mother! slowly builds on its psychological tension to its bizarre and surreal Grand Guignol conclusion. The first act of the film focuses on the main character's possible motives and odd behavior while the second act becomes a frenzied rush of violence and gore to appease the horror crowd. Moviegoers, overly familiar with these scare tactics, will have a been-there-done- that vibe. It's a real mishmash, but an artful journey into madness. Mr. Aronofsky sets up his action and intensifies his subject with overt religious symbolism and gruesome images that may shock and offend his audience. His hellish hallucinations, of which there are many, resonate, even if his own screenplay lacks imagination and cohesion.The cast play out their roles with much energy and passion. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent and plays her every-woman with much verve. Mr. Bardem gives his one-dimensional role some needed depth. Mr. Harris and especially Ms. Pfeiffer round out the ensemble with solid turns.Yet the film's underlying theme, that fame and obsession can corrupt one's soul, takes a backseat to the non-existent scares and chills. As written in Mr. Aronofsky's jumbled script, Mr. Bardem's poet character remains an enigma throughout and his actions may show a vain and unloving husband or a confused helpless artist allowing his ambition to run amok. Ms. Lawrence's title character is part doormat / part romantic. We know opposite can attract but we never feel that there is any connection with the couple. Their give-and-take moments lead to a completely laughable (rather than horrifying) and unsatisfying conclusion.mother! is far from great cinema. Yes, it is a skillfully well-crafted horror film, even if the script is all over the place. It remains a major disappointment from a talented director. The film's title may end in that dubious exclamation point, but perhaps a question mark might be a more fitting punctuation.￼NOTE: The poster truly captures the grotesqueness of the film and its in-your-face shock value very well. The false sense of beauty and innocence is set off balance with the bloody surreal image of that bleeding heart and the blood-soaked virginal white dress. Superb use of contrast and style. Actually, the poster is better the film. Watch that instead!",4,4,8,16 September 2017

Not since The Riddle of the Sphinx has a hypothetical query bothered so many and answered so few: In the ultimate battle between The Man of Steel and The Caped Crusader, who would rule victorious? In Zack Snyder's comic book blockbuster, both superheroes come to blows and the outcome is up there on the big screen in all of its CGI glory.￼In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the stage is set for this heroic showdown, although it takes over half of the film until the deed occurs. Just as our world has lost some of its innocence, so has this modern day retelling. Cynicism and despair seem to not only fester in our superheroes nowadays. It is obviously in our film directors and screenwriters as well. This is a darker vision, but aren't most action blockbusters? Comic book heroes are no longer comic. So follows our films, the essence of pop culture and pessimism with our popcorn.As its story unfolds, Superman (Henry Cavill) is an unpopular anti-hero. While previously fighting General Zod (Michael Shannon) to save the world, he has also systemically destroyed Metropolis in his battle of good v evil. Much destruction and many lives were mere collateral damage during this war to end all wars. One of these victims viewing the cosmic free-for-all is Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who decides to take matters into his own hands. And the battle of egos begins... ￼On hand are many faces that doted the mythology of both superheroes. On one side are Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Mrs. Kent (Diane Lane), and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), reprising their roles and on the other, loyal servant Alfred (Jeremy Irons), and assorted Bat-gear and nifty gadgetry, all the money can buy. Watching the match-up, with rapt interest are Diana Prince (an underused Gal Gadot) and megalomaniac Lex Luther (an oddly miscast Jesse Eisenberg, substituting triviality instead of menace). Let's rumble! Or, at least, grumble.￼With the exception of the aforementioned Mr. Eisenberg, the cast acquits themselves rather nicely, giving their one-dimensional characters some depth. Both Mr. Cavill and Mr. Affleck fill their spandex with the right about of coolness and sex appeal, the former with a broad- shouldered charm and the latter wisely underplays the brooding millionaire playboy. ￼However, script-wise, the film loses its footing, in the most logical sense. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice mixes political issues like racial profiling (in this case, alien v human), vigilantism, violence, religion, terrorism, and evil capitalism with its populist message. It's heady stuff, even if the screenplay by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer cannot bring together its own thought process with the numerous sub-plots that continually arise. The film relies on far too many dream sequences and flashbacks that only increase the film's length and confuse the main plot. Judicious editing would have only helped the film. Again, less is more.￼But in the hands of its director, restraint is non-existent. He fills every inch of the screen with crashes, explosions, and in-your-face CGI. Mr. Snyder, not one of my favorite directors, I must add, throws in everything, including a kitchen sink. (It's true!) Still, this may be his finest film to date, He does keep things moving along, although it is hard to tell if the film's many action sequence are well staged on his part, due to the frenzied editing by David Brenner and blurry hand-held camera-work by Larry Fong.With the film's superfluous multiple endings, justice may finally be served and a new sequel will arriving soon to a movie theater near you. (Many moviegoers in my audience wore Batman or Superman t-shirts and sat transfixed through the showing.) However, for this critic, the verdict for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is simply this: it may not be a misfire, but the evidence remains inconclusive. Call it a mistrial.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,13,24,25 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," Musical Hokum
","JIM'S REVIEW: The Greatest Showman has its heart in the right place, but it unfortunately never achieves its musical goal. It invests a lot, and I mean a lot, of talent and hard work with very little dividend. The songs are foot-stomping, uplifting, and hummable tunes, but become derivative imitations of themselves. Every musical number sounds and looks alike with no modulation. Even the ballads are slow-downed versions of other songs in the film. The original score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul lacks range, a deliberate sameness creeps in for most musical moments, but their music definitely delivers in energetic peppiness with toe-tapping 'feel-good' form. They are experts in writing clever 'hooks'. The modern choreography is more 2017 variety than 1917 period but is very well done. Kudos to Ashley Wallen and his accomplished dancers for stomping their way into your hearts.Nathan's Crowley's lovely production design sings out, as does the costumes created by Ellen Mirojnick. Michael Gracey's solid direction is fluid and successfully captures the nostalgic musical origins of the big Hollywood musicals of yore (although think what these filmmakers could have done with Cy Coleman's far superior Broadway musical gem, Barnum!).The major problem with the film, and it is a major issue, is the paper thin plot that follows the most predictable of story-lines. Whenever the singing and dancing stops, so does the film. The screenplay by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon is a real letdown, with underwritten characters and petty conflicts all under the big top in a very conventional way. Their script is mostly an outline to serve the musical moments and rarely advances the plot. The relationships are all strained beyond reality and each character seems to be a mere prop device to lead into the next musical interlude.The casting is a mixed bag also. Hugh Jackman is really the greatest showman, more so than Barnum himself. He is a natural song and dance man. Watching him move with such grace and charisma is almost worth the price of admission (but there is that awful script, remember). Michelle Williams is his loving wife, Charity, and she is given so little to do to showcase her musical talents. Zac Efron as rich playboy, Phillip Carlyle, tries hard, but just doesn't have the musical ability, no matter how they edit the movie. Zendaya plays his love interest and their love story seems like a second thought. Their romance may convince a giddy twelve-year-old girl about the things we do for love, but it left me questioning the things they did for a paycheck. Perhaps the weakest link is the usually dependable Rebecca Ferguson, totally miscast as the operatic Jenny Lind. Supposedly this world renown singer and crowd-pleasing attraction to Barnum's circus of oddities, wowed the patrons back then. However, the singing on the screen could never come near a high C. Ms. Ferguson's performance is more like a B-flat. (In creating such an important supporting role, it is beyond me why the filmmakers couldn't find an attractive and trained opera singer to fill the bill. Go to the Met and take your pick.)So, even though the movie is entertaining on a musical level, The Greatest Showman is plain hokum, albeit nice-looking hokum. There is plenty of razzle-dazzle on display although it is just painted cardboard and glitter that remains. As Barnum would say, 'There is one born every minute.' (Even though Ms. Lind could not hit that high C, the film's earned that grade from this critic.)",6,2,4,1 January 2018
Saving Mr. Banks," Barely Poppins
","Saving Mr. Banks is the story about the making of the Disney classic, Mary Poppins. And just as that film sentimentalized P. L. Travers' children's novel, so does this film sugarcoat the true behind-the-scenes scenario. By the tablespoonful!No, this film treatment doesn't make it go down any easier. There is no genuine dramatic tension as Saving Mr. Banks simplifies its tale by constantly cleansing the facts for more wholesome family enjoyment. The script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith melds two stories unsuccessfully. It presents Mrs. Travers' troubled childhood memories set in Australia, 1901 with her displeasure at having her novel become a major Walt Disney musical extravaganza in Los Angeles, 1964. Neither story quite gels. Mrs. T. may have had daddy issues, but director John Lee Hancock never has a real grasp of the facts or the fiction. The direction is stilted and heavy-headed as facts are treated with melodramatic flourish and never fully presented or realized.*Generally speaking, the acting is good. Emma Thompson plays the uptight author with a determined haughtiness and ongoing petulance that gives her character some nuance. Tom Hanks' Uncle Walt is less of the clever manipulative businessman and too much of the sweet Grandpa type. Their relationship, which was and should have been more volatile, is downplayed and lacking the needed 'gravitas'' as P. L. Travers would have said. Providing that gravitas is Colin Farrell as the author's alcoholic father. The actor gives especially fine support along with the always dependable Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the songwriting team known as the Sherman Brothers.Saving Mr. Banks does hold one's interest, especially when it stays within the problems involved with the making of the Disney classic film.  The film is always entertaining and interesting fodder, but a classic for the Disney vault it ain't!  GRADE: B-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com* NOTE: Just one example of playing loose with the facts: Mrs. Travers disliked the finished Disney version of her novel, although her reaction to the film at its premiere is precisely the opposite effect than Saving Mr. Banks indicates.",6,4,9,3 January 2014
Jojo Rabbit," A Comedy Used as a Weapon of Mass Destruction
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A flawed but memorable dark satire about Nazism.JIM'S REVIEW: It so hard to make a Nazi comedy. The sheer subject of their heinous acts of brutality shown in satirical terms is off-putting from the start. Even with decades between WWII and the present day rise of white supremacy and hate crimes, the pain and cruelty is not easily forgotten, nor should it be. This is not to say that using comedy as weapon is a new approach. And now. some eighty five years later, we have Jojo Rabbit taking direct aim at the Hitler regime.Taika Waititi wrote, directed and starred in this independent film and while his intent is admirable, his execution is slightly flawed. As a director, he creates many memorable scenes with powerful images that carry with them a rare beauty and insight. At times, there is sheer brilliance in his vision, as with his opening credit sequence which mixes anachronistic lyrics of the Beatles' Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand, sung in German, with actual Nazi archival footage showing the mass hysteria of a mob mentality. But at other times, he wallows in sentimentality and the obvious targets of blundering Nazis.As a screenwriter, his coming-of-age tale about a young impressionistic Hitler youth living with his widowed mother and dealing with an imaginary friend named Adolf has an intriguing premise. He layers his narrative with bittersweet moments and comical conflict. We meet a 10 year old boy caught up in a nationalistic frenzy whose bedroom walls are covered with pro-Nazi propaganda rather than sport figures or movie idols, a telling sign. Something is amiss in Johann. He is an enigma, a child soldier who will parrot the hate speech he is carefully taught but yet sensitive enough to discover the beauty of that aforementioned solitary blue butterfly flitting through his war-torn village. But Mr. Waititi's dialog lacks substantial power, some of the comedy elements are broad slapstick and don't work, and most of his supporting characters are cliche-ridden stock types. Also, story-wise, the plot loses its logical path with a plot twist that comes unexpectedly midway through the film and has some trouble recovering from it. Still there is so much to admire due to his filmmaking skills and the fine photography by Mihai Malaimare Jr.As an actor, Mr. Waititi is effective. Yet he never captures the goofiness and comic edge of Der Fuhrer, which is a minor misstep in this pivotal role. His interpretation should have been more outlandish and farcical. He just doesn't show the menace or the charisma. His character annoys rather than enthralls. Perhaps another actor would have been a better choice and would have given him some distance in this filmmaker trifecta.However, Roman Griffin Davis in the title role is excellent. Perfectly cast, this young actor gives one of the most natural performance by a child ever filmed and his portrayal of a boy coming to terms with the insane world around him is quite moving. His expressive face conveys a child learning war games but unable to tie his own shoes. Thomasin McKenzie plays Elsa, a Jewish girl hiding in Jojo's house and she has a nice chemistry with Mr. Davis. Scarlett Johansson provides some tender moments as Rosie, Jojo's loving mother. The reliable Sam Rockwell tries to add some depth in his sketchy role as is Captain Klenzendorf, an Army officer in charge of a Hitler Youth camp, but Rebel Wilson as his assistant can't keep her German accent straight, let alone find the essence of her role. Stephen Merchant delivers the creepiness as a Gestapo agent and Archie Yates brings some wonderful comic timing as Jojo's clumsy friend, Yorki.Jojo Rabbit is another reworking of the sum of its parts being better than the whole. Nevertheless, the film remains a welcome and strong indictment to hatred with Mr. Waititi definitely a talent to watch. His film uses comedy as a lethal weapon and it lands mainly on target. This reviewer look forward to his next venture and so should any serious moviegoer.Comedy as a Weapon of Mass Destruction",8,2,6,24 November 2019
Son of Saul," A Holocaust Film That Deserves To Be Seen
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Despite its powerful images, the film's threadbare story feels more of a plot device than it need be.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: A concentration camp prisoner goes on a personal quest to find a rabbi among the other prisoners who can give a dead child a proper Jewish funeral.￼JIM'S REVIEW: 2015's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film winner, Hungary's Son of Saul, finally has its nation-wide theatrical distribution release and arrives to our local cinemas nearly four months after debuting in New York and Los Angeles to meet Academy Award deadlines. (I will be including this film in my 2016 film list.)Géza Röhrig plays Saul, an Auschwitz survivor and 'Sonderkommando'' (bearer of secrets), part of a select crew of prisoners whose daily routine includes cleaning the concentration camp's showers and efficiently disposing of the bodies of Jewish victims.￼First-time director László Nemes conveys strong images of the atrocities. He usually shows the violent acts in distant background shots, making these cruel and senseless acts more horrific and focusing on Saul himself and his numbing reaction to the slaughter surrounding him. It is an auspicious debut of a talent to watch.The film is brutal and most effective in its handling of the daily torture and murder that befell the Auschwitz Jewish population. Its matter-of-fact telling and use of sound design and mixing heightens the tension. There is no music score to manipulate our emotions, creating an all too real experience.￼But the film's screenplay, also by its director and Clara Royer, follows a rather thin storyline that, while heart-breaking, fails to make sense. If Saul's sole mission is to give a dead child a proper Jewish funeral, a human and heroic action, his incessant dedication endangers everyone around him, not to mention his ability to illogically travel throughout the camp without notice or objection. This gives our protagonist the appearance of being a foolhardy and dangerous loner, unable to show any degree of emotion or concern about anyone or anything else. This may be the trait the director wants in his character, yet it makes Saul unsympathetic and his motives and actions remain an enigma. Mr. Röhrig is good in his role, although other characters are sketchy and stereotypes of the genre (the angry rebel, the evil Nazi, the brutish bully, etc.), in need of more delineation. Still, Son of Saul skillfully depicts the Holocaust with disturbing reality and reaches a sad and satisfying conclusion that makes this harrowing journey all the more memorable.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8,1,6,11 March 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Sci-Fi Norsesense
","￼This film is not recommended.Thor is back but, this time around, it felt like a visit to the Bizarro World rather than a journey to the dark world as the title proclaims. Everything that I truly enjoyed in the first installment of this franchise had an oddly opposite reaction for me in Thor: The Dark World. Everything in this latest installment seemed out of kilter from its entertaining 2011 predecessor. (However, it was during the film that I did have a full out-of-body experience: I so wanted to take this body out of the theater, away from the stifling boredom and unending disengagement of all the silly action and sci-fi mythos, but dear moviegoers, I dutifully fought that urge.)In Thor: The Dark World, the comic banter is missing (with only one laugh total), as is the beefcake factor (with only one shirtless interlude). With this sequel, everything seems terribly oppressive. In his battle to save Earth, Thor must battle a new villain, Malekith (played one- dimensionally by Christopher Eccleston). Malekith is the leader of the Dark Elves, a group of mutant warriors bent on world destruction (what else?) with the help of a weapon of mass destruction called the Aether (pronounced ether). As with the first film, the film bounces from one battle scene on either a desolate planet or an Art Deco wonderland. Whenever the action takes place on Planet Asgard, the film has recharged energy and strong action footage, whereas, when we go to Planet Earth, the film bogs down and lands with a thud.Chris Hemsworth, who was so much fun when we first met him as Thor, plays the role all too seriously. He's still an earnest hero, but that fish out of water conceit is no more. (And it was that premise which helped achieve the film's unique and special charm in the first outing.) Natalie Portman is wasted in her role as his astrophysicist gal pal. The wonderful chemistry between these actors playing Thor and Jane that once was is no more. Now Jane is a cute harpy and Thor goes from hunk to lunk. At least, he still has that magic hammer and knock- out abs. Hopkins, who was solid before as Odin, is now all ham and he never quite passes the muster. Such fine actors as Ray Stephenson, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgard are underused in minor roles. Only Tom Hiddleston as Thor's jealous and evil sibling, Loki, has the campy menace and star presence to make this film sequel-worthy.The CGI is more than adequate as is Alan Taylor's direction. A few action sequences are well staged while others are inessential time fillers. Like the mighty Aether, the numerous and loud sci-fi action numbs the senses and only dulls the pain. The screenplay by Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely is more convoluted than necessary with too much exposition spent on the Norse sci-fi background or establishing the next fight scene instead of developing characters and motives. Thor: The Dark World just seems needlessly strung together from one battle sequence to the next, as Thor, Jane, and the gang travel from one portal dimension to the next anomaly. The film plays more like an expensive video game than it does a real movie. Boring.As superhero movies go, the film is a minor disappointment. Marvel's Thor: The Dark World is no marvel at all. It's just more of the same, and not really all that interesting. GRADE: CANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4,1,3,20 November 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Puppy Unlove
","This film is recommended.' And they called it puppy love, Just because we're in our teens Tell them all it isn't fair, To take away my only dream. '<ul><li>Lyrics by Paul Anka's Puppy Love</li></ul>The year is 1965. Sam ( Jared Gilman ) and Susie ( Kara Hayward ) have fallen in love. These teenagers want to desperately escape from the harsh realities of our adult world. So they form a secret pact and run away from all of the conformity, rules, and regulations that can easily complicate a child's life. Down with authority or any sense of order. It's freedom that this loners are after. But it is their very actions that create a domino effect of events that impact the complacency of a tiny New England community. This once peaceable kingdom slowly becomes unhinged in Wes Anderson's nostalgic whimsy of a film, Moonrise Kingdom.Wes Anderson has assembled a stock troupe of eccentric actors to play his stock collection of eccentric characters. This group of indie favorites includes the stalwart Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, with Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton newly added to his repertoire of quirky performers this time around. They bring their zany characters to life.The end result is a diverting rehash of Anderson's highly personal themes and style: his ongoing search for lost childhood innocence and its stark divergence from reality; his somewhat surreal take on the world as it once was; his contrasting color palette brimming over with visual razzle-dazzle; his off-balanced sense of irony and humor. All of his trademarks are there as he playfully toys with his characters and their dilemmas. ( The director seems to be somewhat inspired by Truffaut's film, Breathless, but with a more comic and quaint tone, as these young fugitive lovers try to escape from society with their 45's, children's books, and binoculars in tow. )While Anderson has a knack for capturing the joys and frustrations of adolescence and he thoroughly defines the awkwardness and simplicity of first love in his solid direction and humorous script ( with Roman Coppola as co-writer ), the director makes a few missteps along the way when he introduces some unnecessary violent images and an episode with the Schwartman's character that makes no logical sense. This takes the film on an absurd detour that almost deflates its satirical edginess. These scenes transports Moonrise Kingdom into the realm of stark reality which the film tries to avoid at all costs and 'seriously' undercut the upbeat and carefree mood and message that worked so effortlessly within most of the film. The young leads are perfectly cast as the misunderstood outcasts and their underage antics have all the more charm due to the natural performances that Anderson brings to the screen. Other factors that aid in the film's success are the surreal photography by Robert D. Yeoman which immediately shows the departmentalizing of its characters and their surroundings with its doll-house fascination of Susie's home, the humorous touches in the costumes by Kasia Walicka-Maimone ( loved the scout uniforms' detailing ), and the eclectic musical score by Alexandre Desplat, with assists from Benjamin Britton and Hank Williams. The film is, without question, a decidedly quirky film that relishes in its own bizarre tendencies, and for the most part, entertains with its outlandish and idiosyncratic distinctiveness. Anderson's imaginative vision offers much to admire. Like the film's many odd characters, Moonrise Kingdom's originality and wholehearted uniqueness make for a satisfying movie-going experience and ultimately cajoles its audience into believing, once again, in the joys of childhood innocence and the power of puppy love.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Re-Inforced
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: In the capable hands of J.J. Abrams, this saga will live long and prosper (wrong film series, but right sentiment).GRADE: BThere is a force reawakening the latest Star Wars installment and his name is J.J. Abrams. This gifted director quickens the pulse of an aging and dying franchise and resuscitates the series, breathing new life into this once glorious vibrant serial. He deftly mixes our love and nostalgia of the old with the state-of-the art technology of the new, blending beloved older characters from past entries with more contemporary prototypes and insuring a long life-span to the series. The end result is a thrilling sci-fi adventure film that delivers in its action sequences but plays it all-too-safely with a winning formula that never come near George Lucas' original source. ￼Chaos continues to reign in a galaxy far, far away. Now the evil First Order wants to dominate the universe while rebel forces try to fight against it. The good guys from the Old Guard (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, Luke and the droids) are back and their new replacements (Rey, Finn, Poe and a new droid) battle the bad guys (Kylo Ren, General Hux, and the Supreme Leader Snoke, plus many Stormtroopers). That's the thin story in a nutshell and all one needs to know or gets from the efficient screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Arndt and Abrams himself.￼The CGI is top-notch and the action scenes are very well staged, although I personally had some trouble with the choppy editing undercutting some of the excitement, especially with the climactic light saber duel. With all the creativity and talent behind it, the film cannot disguise the fact that it relies too heavily on its first two films from the series (or should I say its forth and fifth chapters, to be more precise), taking those plot devices and upgrading it for today's movie-going audience. In truth, originality is a scarce commodity in this hybrid film, even if the visuals do impress.￼Yet, how could you not be in rapture with the likes of the charismatic Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher as they past the torch to the newcomers, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and scene-stealer, Daisy Ridley? Also giving their best malevolent moves are Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and an effective Adam Driver as a Darth Vader wannabe. Plus, Lupita Nyong'o offers super voice- over work as a memorable CGI creation named Maz Kanata and John Williams' flawless score continues to make this film soar light-years and beyond.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a joyful escapist entertainment as crowdpleasers go. And no review, be it a positive rave or less than glowing words from the dark forces within some critics, can topple this galactic blockbuster.NOTE: The 3-D IMAX effects are less than earth-scattering, literally.

Flight," A Fall from Grace
","This film is highly recommended.The friendly skies aren't all that friendly in Robert Zemeckis' Flight, a well-written melodrama that deals with alcoholism and drug abuse, America's fascination with heroes, and the news media's zeal for the behind-the-scenes investigation.Flight is a film about a man's fall from grace, both literally and figuratively speaking. The man in question is 'Whip' Whitaker, an ace aviator, alcoholic, and drug user. After avoiding a fiery crash that saved many lives, in the film's best sequence, Whip is thrust into the public spotlight. It seems much easier controlling his aircraft than his own life choices. Hiding behind his dark aviator glasses cannot hide the fact that Whip was high on alcohol and cocaine when flying that plane. With the media frenzy caused by his heroic aerial maneuvers and the FAA opening up the case, Whip may have successfully navigated his plane to safety, but there's still enough turbulence ahead on his bumpy road to recovery. Upside down may be a perfect phrase to describe Whip's plane, but it also describes his life, one that is still in turmoil as he tries to avoid his personal free fall in this tragic aftermath.Director Robert Zemeckis returns to the live action format after experimenting in computerized animation with mixed results ( Beowulf, The Polar Express, and his best effort, Disney's A Christmas Carol ). However, his prior knowledge in that area of technology has helped to produce a dazzling set piece involving the near crash that begins this film.It is the most memorable portion of Flight, a beautifully constructed sequence that shows off his skills by seamlessly incorporating sound and CGI effects, taut editing, specific camera angles, and carefully selective photographic images which create a harrowing white-knuckle moment in cinematic history. ( Special mention must go to his assembled production crew: cinematographer Don Burgess, film editor Jeremiah O' Driscoll, and special effects supervisor Michael Lantieri. Also, Alan Silvestri's subtle and original score serves the film well without over-emphasizing the action on screen except for the inclusion of some pop standards that counteract that effect. )After this thrilling action-packed scene, the film settles on the emotional and sometimes predictable storyline of the film's main character and his bout with alcohol. The film does not shy away from the seedier side of its anti-hero and his drug dependency. Casting is foremost in this role, especially if the film is to gain the momentum from which it began. Fortunately, Zemeckis has wisely put Denzel Washington in that pilot seat. Now Washington has always been a fine actor, but lately he has relied too heavily on his leading man status and charisma to carry him through ill-conceived roles. ( Just try sitting through Unstoppable or The Book of Eli as proof. ) His strength as an actor has always been in flawed characterizations and villains ( Training Day, Malcolm X, The Hurricane ). Here the actor gives one of his most powerful performances in years.The fine supporting cast includes Kelly Reilly, delivering a strong performance as Nicole, a young drug user whom Whip befriends, Tamara Tunie as Margaret, a flight attendant and friend, Bruce Greenwood as his union representative and friend, and a scene-stealing John Goodman as Harland Mays, his hipster supplier. Don Cheadle teams with Washington again, this time as his crafty lawyer. Their sparring as attorney and client gives the audience the privilege of seeing these two talented performers play off each other so skillfully. John Gatins wrote the literate screenplay and keeps his character-driven situations as realistic and honest as possible, except for a slightly maudlin uplifting ending that might satisfy most moviegoers. ( To me it seemed too preachy and self-righteous, regardless of Washington's acting prowess. ) Still, Flight is an exciting action thriller, skillfully directed by Zemeckis and flawlessly acted by Washington, who creates an intense character study of an alcoholic, a man in crisis unable to stop his downward spiral until he begins to realize that he can't fly away from himself or his real issues.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Hexed, Vexed, and Perplexed
","This film is recommended. Good versus evil! You'll hear no spoiler from me in this review, although it doesn't take a rocket scientist or any wizard to guess the outcome in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The gang's all back and more in the final thrilling installment of the HP series.In the incomplete HP7: Part One, we left off with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still trying to gather the Horcruxes ( pieces of Lord Voldemort's soul ) to finally rid the world of this villainous predator and his black magic crew of crazies and Death Eaters. Sacrifices were made and lives taken in the ongoing struggle against evil domination. And HP7: Part Two wastes no time with any informational flashbacks or needed exposition to aid its audience to recall any history or plot. It's up to each and every moviegoer to do their homework and bring their own prior knowledge to the proceedings. Every Muggle for himself! ( It is here that I must confess that I had some difficulty with my lack of knowledge about some minor characters from other installments who now have major roles in this segment of J. K. Rowling's massive saga. Their importance and interrelationship with others seemed incongruous to the action on the screen before me, while other more interesting characters from earlier versions never materialized in this last chapter. I was in desperate need of a program, map, or CliffsNotes to guide me through the film's cast of thousands. )This final film emphasizes action and special effects with very little narrative and character driven dialog. It's all about tying up loose ends and providing a jolly good conclusion for its loyal fan base. That the film was somewhat anti-climatic and a bit unsatisfying to me came as a surprise. Yes, all the beloved characters are there, even if it is only a cameo bit for some. All are armed with magical wands and potent potions, ready for battle, but the film's pace felt a bit rushed and on overdrive to me, with this part relying too much on special effects to counteract any real emotional connection for me. Still it's a minor quibble with all the lush production values, lavish sets, sound effects, marvelous CGI and make-up, and valuable assists from the cast members of this monumental series.For the last ten years, the moviegoer could sit back and partake of an illustrious collection of talented British actors that have lived and prospered with enough serious British coinage and global fame from this film series. We watched these actors breathing new life into Rowling's multi-dimensional supporting characters and journeyed with them, caught in the complex genealogies of Harry and family and participating in their physical and emotional growth. Special praise must be given to the perfectly inspired casting of Daniel Radcliffe as our hero who has grown more as an actor than one would have expected. Radcliffe's likability and poise given to his role, along with the fine chemistry with his cohorts, Rupert Glint and Emma Watson, brought an added intensity to the films. The film's strong supporting cast, which includes Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and the reliable Ralph Fiennes as the Dark Lord, are just some of the thespians who provided their own unique form of magic with their endearing eccentricities and subtle quirks that helped to make this series so successful. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 may satisfy many moviegoers and devotees of the books. However, for this ordinary Muggle, it was more of a technical triumph than a purely fulfilling movie-going experience. HP7: Part 2 is a fitting ending for a mammoth undertaking that has become an impressive part of cinematic history and epic filmmaking. One could easily admire the craftsmanship and dedication of all those involved with this worthwhile project rather than truly love the finished result.

Unbroken," St. Louis
","This film is recommended. (Rating: ☆☆☆)In this year of biographies, Unbroken breaks no new ground. It's a familiar tale of an American hero battling inhumane obstacles that would kill the normal man. In this case, it is the true life story of Louis Zamperini and his horrific days as a prisoner-of-war. The film follows the winning formula of most biopics beginning with a troublesome adolescence, traumatic circumstances that lead to international glory, and an inspirational upbeat ending complete with actual photographs of the real person in the end credits. However, the story being told, with a screenplay contributed to four major talents (the Coen brothers, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson), is riveting drama and presented with much style and restraint. Solidly at the helm is Angelina Jolie, making an impressive directing debut. The film is a huge undertaking and the actress wisely surrounds herself with an A-team of artisans that deliver superb production values. The gifted Alexandre Desplat gives the film a haunting quality that never overpowers the story. Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography transports the film to a high level of artistry with his stunning use of stark shadows and silhouettes. Unbroken may be convention storytelling, but it is a beautifully crafted filmgoing experience.Most of the time, Jolie tends to play it safe, never straying out of the box. She keeps to the true-and-true formula similar to most WII tales: show the heroism and suffering but stress the inner strength, grit, and that all-inclusive American spirit. She lets her admiration of the man cloud her judgment, showing more saint than needed. This skews the film's emotion balance of the story and makes it seem forced and manipulative. Jolie sets up the story into three distinct sections (using direct links of some classic films serving as her inspiration): the early years leading to Olympic fame (with a Chariots of Fire vibe, slow-motion intact) and the standard war saga, complete with sea survival tale(ala Jaws), and a prisoner-of-war epic story (saluting The Bridge of the River Kwai).Jack O'Connell is very good as Mr Zamperini. He gives a heartfelt performance that spans nearly 20 years. Most of the other roles, except for Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Wittrock, are incidental and walking stereotypes. Especially so, is Takamasa Ishihara as the sadistic prison captain, Watanabe. As written, the role seems far too evil and one-note (although the actual war criminal was even more brutal than depicted here). The actor tries to overcome the cliché with varying success. Unbroken is a solid war film that celebrates one man's remarkable life while elevating him to sainthood. It carries gung-ho patriotism under its sleeve and undercuts reality along the way, making the man into a myth and the film into a grand testament of courage and valor.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Lacking Heat
","This film is mildly recommended.The second installment of The Hunger Games took a L-O-N-G time to 'catch fire'. The first hour and a half were a mere retread of the first film, setting up the same tired formula of 'them against us'. The theme of oppression continues to run deep in this saga, and I found the film oppressively smug. Seeing the same totalitarian state with its absurd and garish upper class taking advantage of the down-trodden lower class just grew monotonous and downright silly. The plot of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire still centers around the blood sport of the games, although its violence remains toned down for its targeted teenage PG-13 audience. In this sanitized sequel, the government is concerned about a possible rebellion from the working class peons and our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), becoming their spokesperson and savior. With that in mind, the evil leader of Panem, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) decides that Katniss is a problem that needs to be eliminated, along with her pretend boyfriend and former Hunger Games surviving partner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). So a new scheme is hatched to renew the arena killings once again in order to put our spunky gal in harm's way. (In this sequel, no longer is it just teenagers stalking their peers. Now death has no age limit. Why, there's even a granny thrown into the mix. This version of the Hunger Games is an equal opportunity employer.)Although this film has a new director this time around, Francis Lawrence, it's still the same old rehash, even if it's handled competently. The screenplay is serviceable at best, as are the production values. (I did enjoy some of the amusing over-the-top costume designs by Trish Summerville.) The film does have stronger performances than the first chapter did. The actors bring more energy to their one-dimensional roles. Particularly strong are Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and a comic Stanley Tucci. Sutherland is given more screen time and he makes a most vivid impression as the menacing overlord. However, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lenny Kravitz, Liam Hemsworth, and especially Toby Jones add little to the film. New cast members include the aforementioned Hoffman, Jena Malone, and Sam Claflin as the kindly stud. Ho-hum.As the two leads, Hutcherson is overshadowed by Lawrence, which is how it should be to enable those young female moviegoers to relate to the main character. Lawrence is a talented actress and she truly delivers a strong full-bodied performance, making the role more credible than it deserves. Hutcherson's Peeta is as bland as, well, pita.But it is not until the hunger games actually begin that the film becomes interesting and, dare I say, somewhat exciting. (That's the last hour of the film, so come late and you'll enjoy the film even more.) The jungle setting has the right level of creepiness and there is one sequence that is the film's highlight: a very well-edited segment involving a baboon attack that supplies the missing excitement that is sorely needed after the film's leisurely and lengthy beginnings. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a slow burn indeed. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,11,30,27 November 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate the Bomb
","This film is recommended.True or False: Godzilla has its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in California. Believe it or not, it's true. The King of Monsters is ultra famous, an icon of epic proportions loved and revered by many. Yes, the big guy is back big time in Gareth Edwards' updated reincarnation of the super beast, aptly titled Godzilla.There have been many versions of this reptilian wonder, over thirty sequels since the first successful film in 1954. As a child, I watched that original Godzilla movie on my black & white Zenith TV in awe. I remember going to the movie theater with my buddies and seeing him fight the likes of King Kong, Mothra, and Ghidorah back in the early sixties. I enjoyed the rampaging of Tokyo as the creature lumbered his way across the miniature city models, shrieking and wailing as he gracelessly stomped the citizens and architecture of Japan. No, I didn't get the anti-nuclear message then, nor did I even care as a teenager. It was a group event, a monster movie, badly acted and even worse, badly dubbed, where you could root for the monster and take in all the destruction on the big screen. It was totally cool and mindless fun. This new and improved 2014 version is that too and more. (I also saw the most recent American remake by Roland Emmerich in 1998 which was ravaged by the critics and I didn't love that film, but I didn't hate it that much either.)Godzilla (2014) is a different creature entirely, more refined than crass, a monster with a mission. Even the creature's look and movements are streamlined and adroit. The film also brings in top name stars to add some prestige to the project, trying valiantly to remove the schlock and deliver the shock: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, Elizabeth Olsen, and David Strathairn are here, albeit in minor roles. (There are also many monsters-in- combat scenes, but actually, the most frightening creature in the whole film is Cranston's hideous wig which tends to upstage everyone including the main star of the film. No, not Mr. Cranston, I mean Mr. G. himself! And yes, no doubt, I will be having many restless nights from the recurring nightmares caused by that toupee.) Nevertheless, these actors' presence is felt as the director and the writers weave a more personal story into the mayhem, still paying homage to the creature and its radioactive origins. Besides Godzilla, this reboot focuses on two human characters who fight the monster and their own personal demons: Aaron Taylor- Johnson is Ford Brody, a soldier with an itchy trigger finger and Ken Watanabe is Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, an earnest scientist who views Godzilla in a savior rather than destroyer. The sub-plot is slim and formulaic, but both actors do a solid job of conveying the film's preachy message about man's foolhardy attempt in controlling nuclear power. Much time, perhaps too much time, is spend on the human back-stories and the interrelationship of the film's non-reptilian characters prior to Godzilla's entrance. (The creature doesn't even surface until an hour into the film.)Still, as always, it's the action sequences that matter most. These creatures get around as the film globe-trots from China and Hawaii and California and Nevada, specifically Las Vegas (well, they are high-rollers), to where else but that iconic landmark of monster movies, the Golden Gate Bridge, for a climactic smack-down. This Godzilla uses state-of-the-art visuals to keep interest high. (The tsunami sequence is thrilling.) The CGI work is very impressive. However, the 3-D effects scattered throughout the movie don't really amount to much and the MUTO monsters (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), lack real menace or originality and are inspired too closely from Aliens, Starship Troopers, and Transformers. Production values are strong, especially Seamus McGarvey's imaginative cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's dramatic musical score which helps to contribute to the film's success. As the director, Edwards' unique vision incorporates shadows, aerial perspectives, and clever point of views via masks and goggles to bring some needed tension. He efficiently shoots the film with a minimum of story and a maximum of tightly staged battles, keeping the action at the forefront and making Godzilla (2014) an unexpected guilty pleasure. This film will do serious damage at the box office with, I'm sure, another sequel in the near future. Godzilla lives on!

Looper," In and Out of the Loop
","This film is recommended.The fundamental things apply as time goes by and by and by in the intriguing futuristic sci-fi fantasy known as Looper. It has strong special effects, a well-constructed script, and a cast of actors who spring into action whenever needed. The film doesn't always stay on course, but it usually piques one's interest with its intelligent screenplay.The year is 2074, but we almost immediately loop back to the past, circa 2044. That year is the drop-off point of human recycling as the mob uses their hit-men to take out its human garbage, leaving no evidence of any murders in their present day dimension. This is time- travel with an evil twist as we meet one of a group of specialized assassins known as loopers: Joe ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) is ready to dispatch another transported victim. The body count of his victims grows as does his reputation and his wages. One slight glitch in the life of any looper: The job has a short shelf life, and every looper will automatically be forced into retirement. There will be a day in their future where the looper will be hired to execute himself, that is, an older prototype of himself. And that day eventually arrives when Joe discovers his designated target is a 30 year older version of himself ( Bruce Willis ). To kill or not to kill? The cat and mouse chase begins.Director / writer Rian Johnson takes his clever premise and keeps his mind games in motion throughout most of his film until he begins to introduce some sub-plots and characters that become close reminders of other sci-fi predecessors, particularly the plot line to The Terminator mixed with an old Twilight Zone episode starring a young Billy Mumy. Until that point, the film is a fresh and original diversion. At the midway point, it begins to lose some of its energy.Still, the lead actors have enough chemistry between them to fully engage the movie-going audience with enough action and thought-provoking situations, even if the film, begins to lose interest in their initial relationship taking them on separate paths to solve their dilemmas and adding some unnecessary complications in the process. It is the actors' relationship that makes Looper more fascinating than it really is. In fact, Gordon-Levitt wears some prosthetic make-up throughout the film to resemble some of Willis' physical traits. The actor also imitates some of his quirks and line delivery to try to make a direct connection to his older character. It's an interesting concept and works most of the time. ( The make-up, however, does not always succeed and, in some scenes, becomes a distraction, with Gordon-Levitt not even resembling the character he is playing. His facial appearance seems overworked and unintentionally disconcerting in a few key scenes, but even then, the make-up, at least, looks real. ) Willis plays on his strength as the sage action hero with very few words to impart, but he handles his guns well. His quieter scenes actually show off his range as one of our more underrated actors.Both Emily Blunt who plays Sara, a tough survivor type with a temperamental tyke at her side and Jeff Daniels as Abe, a notorious mob boss who enjoys his menace and his power, give ample support and use their acting skills to breathe some depth into their stereotypical roles of good and evil.So Looper is a relatively entertaining movie that tries to deal with larger issues like changing one's own destiny or the effect of time continuum relationships, but ultimately, Looper seems more comfortable just being a solid action flix, sacrificing its sci-fi origins in exchange for shoot-em-up thrills, leaving the film's more absorbing prospects lost somewhere in time.

Life," Life is Unexciting
","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: C+ THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Life disappoints.SYNOPSIS: Life can be quite deadly as a group of astronauts discover in this typical sci-fi thriller.No one may hear a scream in outer space. But in Daniel Espinoso's well-crafted Life, the latest sci-fi horror film which follows that successful Alien formula, you do hear, with added certainty, an annoyingly loud music score that regularly blasts its notes to warn of impending doom. Six internationally diverse NASA professionals find life amid the soil samples from Mars. As this multi-celled organism begins to take form, so does the predictability of this film. It's par for the course, that the trained astronauts grow dumb and dumber while our little plant monster (affectionately named Calvin) grows stronger and bigger. There's no account that there will be room for human error on the screen. Dinner will be served soon enough!However, the behind-the-scenes human talent have made a technically strong film. One can definitely observe that the filmmakers took a more intellectual and earnest approach to this genre with their willingness to spend more time with the characters and setting before the initial scares begin. Shamus McGarvey's fluid camera-work is above reproach as is Nigel Phelp's production design. Mr. Espinoso's direction builds some nice tension too. But the script is a mere clone with its 'been there / done that' formula. It's not that Life's screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is lifeless...it's just redundant and unexciting in its lack of imagination. It's not as if the writers don't try to create compelling characters by establishing background exposition on the six astronauts aboard. And there is some nice sleight-of-hand moments in the film's climax. But all that skill cannot disguise the simplistic plot mechanisms so intrinsic with the sci-fi nature of its origins.Life begins as a serious film odyssey about space exploration before it take the rote route into the horror genre and settles into a standard monster flick to see who gets offed next and how gruesome the death can be. The monster itself isn't very scary. It's not hideous or creepy, with its octopoid tentacles and jellyfish form undulating quite gracefully before lunging at its helpless victims.The actors (or human entrees) along for the ride are an impressive group of performers who have done much better in other outings but are saddled here with stock characters caught in a familiar plot, no matter have solidly Mr. Espinoso directs them. They are: Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, and lesser known actors as Olga Dihovichnaya, Hiroyuki Sabada, and Ariyon Bakare, all rounding out the sextet of space travelers.To summarize: Calvin is actually Audrey III of Outer Space, a toothless, less terrifying creature that preys on other lifeforms. Its appetite may be insatiable but moviegoers should take heed of this simplistic horror film with its cheap thrills and gory kills. As the saying goes, Life can be full of disappointments.",6,2,7,25 March 2017
50_50," Life is a Crapshoot ( Well, You're Half Right Anyway )
","This film is mildly recommended.50 / 50 is the aptly name dramedy about cancer. Half of the film works beautifully ( the more serious half ) and the other part not so well. Part of the reason is that the comedic elements don't gel with the film's romantic subplots which tends to trivialize its more important disease-of-the-week subject. The grueling scenes of chemotherapy, the callowness of the medical system, and a patient's sudden setbacks just don't build to any significance due to the sit-com hijinks that befall the film's initial interesting premise.Loosely based on a true story of screenwriter Will Reiser ( renamed Adam ), and real life friend of Seth Rogen ( renamed Kyle in the film ), 50 / 50 starts off very promisingly as we meet the likable Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the lead character who is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. His good life is slowly coming undone as he breaks the news to his best friend ( Rogen ), his girlfriend ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) and his mother ( the talented and underused Angelica Huston ). Therapy sessions are on order in the form of a perky and cute psychologist named Katie ( a miscast Anna Kendrick ) as Adam also befriends other sage cancer patients ( winningly played by Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer ).Yes, it all sounds very predictable and it is. Director Jonathan Levine doesn't set the right tone at all for his film. The characters are not fully realized, especially the role of the therapist who tends to break every ethical boundary of her profession. Levine also allows Rogen ( one of the film's producers ) to ham up his role as The Buddy who tends to upstage Levitt every chance he gets. ( And this is one of Rogen's most restrained performance to date. )Yet it is the remarkable talents of Joseph Gordon-Levitt that rescue the film. He subtly captures the horror of his dilemma and projects a bittersweet melancholia as he copes on a daily basis. This actor is so gifted and he is developing a fine resume with his challenging film choices. In fact, due to his acting prowess ( and the skilled support of Serge Houde as the father and the previously mentioned Ms. Huston ) the film's final hospital scene delivers just the right mixture of pathos and humor that most of the film struggles to achieve. Were that Ms. Huston would have had even more scenes, 50 /50 could have become a truly memorable film experience and its odds at success unmatched.

Deadpool," Reynolds Wraps It Up Nicely
","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Ryan Reynolds makes us care about this violent superhero and that's the better half of the fun.GRADE: B-PLOT SUMMARY: After a scientific experiment renders him disfigured but endowed with superhuman strength and powers, Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool, an anti-hero who wants revenge. JIM'S REVIEW: The Marvel Superhero Factory unleashes another action figure from its assembly line of comic book personalities, a hip but crazed vigilante who goes by the name Deadpool. Coming from the second tier of players, instead of its popular A-Team of Avengers, this brand of superhero has some interesting traits unlike his predecessors. Besides loving to kick ass and destroy his foes, this character lobs double entendres and curses to anyone in his vicinity, beats everyone to the bloodiest of pulp (hence, the film's adult rating), and breaks down any walls in his way, especially the fourth one with his pithy and snide asides to our movie-going audience.￼The plot is a typical revenge / action movie. Wade Wilson (a wonderfully charming Ryan Reynolds, who uses his sex appeal most appealingly) takes the form of our favorite mercenary, Deadpool, ready to do battle with his maker, Francis Freeman a.k.a. Ajax (a menacing Ed Skrein), a sadistic scientist and his lovely Igor named Angel Dust (Gina Carano). Of course, Deadpool has help from a supporting group of friends that include his girlfriend, Vanessa (a winning Morcena Baccarin), loyal sidekick, Weasel (a wise-cracking T.J. Miller), and some other X-Men crusaders, Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The action is non-stop and so are the jokes, which land most of the time. Deadpool's foul mouth works overtime to entertain his adult followers between the blood spatter and it all surprisingly works, excluding the over indulgence of too much slow-mo and CGI effects, frenetic editing, and shaky hand-held camera-work. ￼But the filmmakers never take the character or his plight so seriously as in other films of this ilk and are more obsessed with the dark humor aspects in their story. Credit goes to the screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick with their zingy one-liners and director Tim Miller, who gives the film the needed jolt of energy which allows this hero some distinctive qualities that other superheroes in the Marvel universe lack, primarily a underlying sadness that define the human character inside the superhuman. But it is Mr. Reynolds who contributes the most to the film's success. The role fits him like a suit. His anti-charm is the real thing and the actor uses his physical presence to the nth degree, frontal nude scene notwithstanding. Deadpool is far from dead. This avenger has legs (and muscle) with just the right amount of appeal. The movie will make a killing at the box office with a sequel on its way as we speak. So, fans of this comic book genre (and many new devotees) can enjoy the start of a beautiful friendship with a new adult action hero and all of his profanity and insights.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7,7,20,15 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," Cloudy with a Chance of Karma
","This film is mildly recommended.' I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.' - I Am a Walrus by the Beatles Based on David Mitchell's popular novel, Cloud Atlas was given the full big budget Hollywood treatment. With a production team that creates many eye-popping visuals and its all-cast international cast ( Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, and Susan Sarandon are joined by Donna Bae, Keith David, Ben Whitshaw, Jim Sturgess, and James D'Arcy. ), the film seems to have high hopes and an even high pedigree. Directed and written by Tom Tykwer ( Run Lola Run ) and the Matrix Trilogy creators, Andy and Lana Wachowski, Cloud Atlas is a intriguing mystical journey, a messy but noble effort that is worth viewing. Six stories become one in this sci-fi fantasy epic. The ambitious filmmakers tackle a difficult book that interweaves its varied tales with time-tripping details and enough style to disguise the black hole of a script whose characters, plots, and decades collide on a phantasmagoric journey about destiny, fate, and the question of our own existence in the vast cosmos called life. All those heady topics ( good versus evil, life after death, reincarnation, karma, and existentialism ) are explored and regurgitated ad nauseam. It's heavy thinking, dude, with a heavier sleight of hand at work. No wonder the film is nearly three hours long.Visually, Cloud Atlas is a stunner, a thrilling spectacle filled with some wonderful action sequences. But for the most part, its screenplay remains inert, never building to a satisfying emotional or intellectual finish. ( I have to confess that I did unintentionally laugh a bit in the apocalyptic portion of the film where the ludicrous dialog with its rhythmic inflections kept reminding me of Barbara Billingsley's jive talk from Airplane. Sorry, but it really did! ) The stories try to unite the unending theme of oneness and our inability to control our own outcomes as the film takes on metaphysical proportions with the numerous characters involved, their wardrobe changes, and their specific situations. We time-travel through different eras with decidedly mixed results: a slave ship adventure in the late 1800's, a 1930's love story involving two composers, an 70's China Syndrome action thriller about corruption and power, a present-day comic tale of revenge, a futuristic Blade Runner influenced parable set in Korea, and an end of the world precautionary tale that seemed to reuse the macramé wardrobe from Waterworld. This anthology structure of individual sub-plots that co-mingle with past, present, and future events may have intrigued the reader of the written page, but this film adaptation becomes a bit pretentious and labored with much dependent upon the moviegoer's level of believability and personal interest. Due to that factor, some of the time passages are more effective than others. ( Personally, the story lines that were 20th century bound resonated with me while the post millennium story lines were boring and bland. )The directors may have saved some costs with their actors playing multiple roles in various ethnicities, genders, and races, but the overall effect in the execution suffers from that decision. While the majority of the make-up tricks are remarkable, other attempts fell short, particularly with Grant's old man disguise, Weaving's female Nurse Ratchet character transformation, and some of Sturgess' and Weaving's caked-on Asian make-up. ( In fact, most of the make-up for the Caucasian-turned-Korean roles were glaring missteps. ) This artistic choice weakened the film's impact as one continually guesses the true identity of the actor beneath the make-up instead of being drawn totally into the film's dense narrative. Another flaw is the choppy non-linear editing from one story to the next, a device which continually inter-cuts the action and tension of that individual segment.Filmmakers Tykwer and the Wachowskis may have had their heads in the clouds while trying to rein in this demanding novel to align with their creative visions, but, at least, their vivid imaginations allow others to see the book come to life. Cloud Atlas is an unique movie-going experience, a visual treat that entertains in bombastic ways. Unfortunately, its plot structure and words ultimately undermine the film's strong imagery. Although the thematic element of our oneness with the universe is a sound concept, the film seems to struggle to keep its patchwork stories cohesively together. To sum up my feelings about Cloud Atlas, it is best to quote the Beatles yet again: ' The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away...Goo goo g'joob.

The film's main gimmick, similar to Cloud Atlas, was its attempt to disguise its cast with various make-up applications.

Kingsman: The Secret Service," Serviceable
","(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)  This film is mildly recommended.  In brief: A spy film that is shaky, not stirring.  GRADE: B-  Kingsman: The Secret Service is an homage to the British spy film genre  with its sophisticated agents, wry humor, and gadgetry. It sends up the  Ian Fleming spy films but with a harsher edginess and tons of violence.  Matthew Vaughn directs the film with ample flair and style, but his  screenplay (co-written by Jane Goldman) lacks the right degree of  mindless fun and wit. The plot follows the formula of a megalomaniac  wanting to control the world and a secret agency that is hellbent on  stopping him.  The film is very well cast, with the exception of its villain, who acts  more buffoonish than menacing. Samuel L. Jackson plays him, but the  actor never conveys the wickedness very convincingly. Fortunately, the  other actors contribute greatly to the film's enjoyment. Foremost are  its two leads, Colin Firth who handles the action hero bravado very  well and newcomer Taron Egerton as his willing protégé. Mark Strong,  Michael Caine, and Sofia Boutella as the female Oddjob round out the  ensemble.  Kingsman: The Secret Service entertains, but its high level of non-stop  violence is disturbing, especially in a church scene where the body  count reaches absurd heights and skews the film's lighter tone which  effectively is found in films of this genre. Also, the CGI is  amateurish and cheap looking. Kingsman: The Secret Service is based on  a comic book, but comic is not the correct term in describing this  movie.

The Hangover Part III," The Hangover III: Charmless and Humorless
","This film is not recommended.I don't know at what point I began to truly dislike The Hangover Part III. There were so many opportunities before the film descended into an incoherent mess. Was it when the giraffe was decapitated? When a rooster was slowly smothered to death in the misguided name of comedy? Was it when Ken Jeong's annoying character, Mr. Chow, entered the film and was neither decapitated or killed? Who knows, but I can tell you this: The film's 100 minute length seems interminable, devoid of any humor or merit. Its sole purpose of existence is making a buck or two million from its undiscriminating fan base who lap up this cinematic swill. The film's disclaimer states that no animals were hurt in the filming of this movie, but the movie-going audience does suffer and needs to be put out of its misery...fast. The filmmakers take their successful formula and rarely stray from that premise. The formula of vulgar jokes and inane debauchery again follows the mishaps of three closely knit child- men, four, if you count Doug (Justin Bartha) who usually is MIA during most of the film. (Mr. Bartha needs to thank his agent for his lack of screen time here.) The boys, Stu and Phil (Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper, disrespectfully), are united once again to bring Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to rehab. Along the way to Arizona, they encounter a mobster (John Goodman) and are sent on a mission to retrieve some stolen gold and the aforementioned Mr. Chow, landing them back in Sin City, NV.Mixing the Hope / Crosby 40's road movie format and the Three Stooges slapstick antics, and adding more than a dash of gross-out sophomoric humor and ribald sexual comedy, The Hangover Part III lacks any originality or clever moments. (Even the Wolfpack trio, as they are called, too closely resemble Moe (Cooper), Larry (Helms), and Curly (Galifianakis) in their character hierarchy.) There's nothing new here. The film rehashes itself in a desperate attempt to appear to be hip and cool, but the results are merely contrived and dull.Misdirected by Todd Phillips and poorly written by him and Craig Mazin, The Hangover Part III is sloppy drunk in its execution. There are no funny lines and hilarious situations, just tired and lazy writing. The sight gags don't work. The decision to give the obnoxious Mr. Chow almost equal screen time as the three lead characters was a major misfire. All of the actors, who have proved to be fine actors in other films, are certainly slumming here. I guess the cast's ability not to look remotely embarrassed spouting off the film's lame dialog and non-zingers does amount to the lowest possible form of acting, but it's such a waste of assembled talent for this movie, although only Galifianakis gives his character some nuance.This series so proudly wears its gross-out comedy status on its sleeve. While the first installment had some genuine laughs, the second entry had few and was a major disappointment, even with its pot-smoking, penis-nibbling monkey. This third (and supposedly) final chapter is laugh-less and lifeless. What happened in Vegas should have stayed in Vegas, or never have even begun. The Hangover Part III is truly awful.

Green Book," On The Road Again
","Text: GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An above-standard road movie that enthralls with its powerful message and offers two of the best performances of the year.JIM'S REVIEW: Road movies are nothing new. They usually follow a predictable formula with two mismatched people who begin as distant strangers and end as the best of friends. But getting there is the challenge. Past Oscar-winning best picture favorites like It Happened One Night (1934), Rainman (1988), and Driving Miss Daisy (1989) have successfully elevated this genre due to strong acting and a script that brings these character studies to life. Now we can now add another title to this illustrious group...Peter Farrelly's immensely satisfying Green Book.Green Book takes that narrative structure of these celebrated films, although it owes a great deal to the latter. Let's call it Driving Dr. Shirley, especially due to its primary subject being race relations as its two characters meet and travel down south in 1962. But just as that film had two great performances (by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman), this film can also boast about two sensational performances and a literate screenplay that deals with racism head-on.Based on a true story, the film takes these two vastly different personalities on a journey to self-discovery. The simplistic plot revolves around driving a gifted musician into Jim Crow territory to perform concerts for his upper class patrons who can accept his talent but not his race. Taking the maestro to his musical destinations is a bigoted lout named Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga from the Bronx. The obvious set-up is a battle of class vs. crass. Dr. Shirley is uptight, snobbish, and a sophisticated prig; Tony is loud, brutish, and a redneck. This odd couple are destined to debate and argue their one-sidedness as they journey on.Helping them cross the Mason-Dixon Line safely is a little green book, a Negro Motorist CliffNotes guide to safe lodgings and restaurants in the Confederate South. Of course, there will be a series of run-ins from local haters which will bring together Tony and the Doc, as he is nicknamed by Mr. Bada Bing. That is a given. But the treatment to these intolerances is handled very astutely by Mr. Farrelly. He captures the 60's era well and allows his two actors to inhabit their roles. Kudos to the detailed production design by Tim Galvin too.The powerful screenplay by Brian Currie, Nick Vallelonga, and the director is quite effective in its underplaying of events. It depicts the violence and overt racism on display very clearly. My only problem with the film is the continual stereotyping of Italian-Americans. This film, like many others, does proliferate that pre-conceived notion with its cliched roster of thick accents, shady gangster types, and food-gorging personalities.However, what makes this film so very special are the two stand-out lead performances. Mahershala Ali is wonderful in the less showier role as Don Shirley. He shrewdly tampers down the anger, frustration, and righteous indignation of a man 'not black enough, or white enough, to fit into any world'. Mr. Ali plays the role hiding the rage simmering within him. It's a revelation to see his acting range. Viggo Mortensen is terrific as his bodyguard and chauffeur. He plays this strutting bull as a foolish oaf and yet somehow makes Tony endearing. The actor imbues his character with a sense of humanity, avoiding all the pitfalls in this cliche-ridden role. Both deserve many accolades this award season. Also making a strong impression in a smaller role is Linda Cardellini as Tony's loving wife, Dolores.Green Book cast a mirror on racism, exposing our past mistakes and reminding us that things really have not changed in over a century.

Da 5 Bloods," Jumble in the Jungle
","GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Well acted but rambling story about five soldiers who come together for some closure.JIM'S REVIEW: Streaming directly to Netflix and avoiding movie theaters which are still shuttered anyway, Spike Lee's war drama. Da 5 Bloods, takes moviegoers on a long and rambling journey back to the traumas caused by the Vietnam war to our vets and our country. The story may not always be successful in its execution, too much of a Black History 101 lecture, but it does delve into a dark chapter of America's history and makes very relevant points about racism, greed, and honor that we need to continue to discuss during today's harrowing times.Five African-American Vietnam vets, dubbed the 'Bloods', reunite in Ho Chi Minh City with a personal mission: to bring back the remains of their fallen comrade and friend, 'Stormin' Norman' Holloway (Chadwick Boseman). An honorable quest, but there is also an ulterior motive: They also want to retrieve hidden gold bars that these soldiers had buried on a previous operation. While there, these five men will deal with their own personal demons and encounter many obstacles and physical hardships along the way.Clarke Peters plays Otis, the leader of this band of brothers. He visits his former girlfriend, Tiên, who helps him make contacts with a French businessman, Desroche (Jean Reno), who will ensure their safety and buy the gold from them. Also on this mission is Paul, (a wonderful Delroy Lindo...more on him later). Paul is Otis' close friend who suffers from PTSD and carries the guilt and anger of a nation with him. He is a widower who has an estranged relationship with son, David (Jonathan Majors), who came along to Paul's surprise. Paul becomes the catalyst in this multi-layered story and provides the conflict within the Bloods. He is a Trump supporter and his many debates with the others spring from his opposing point of view and set up the tension.As the film goes back and forth in its narrative from 60's war-time Vietnam to present-day, the journey itself becomes a tad strained and far-fetched, with some secondary characters, such as three crusaders from a organization dedicated to clearing landmines, popping up unexpectedly (and all too conveniently) to advanced the plot. Their roles cause the story to stretch plausibility, as do some of the film's other intruders. The screenplay simply needs more clarity and some of the other supporting characters are sketchy and not as well developed, specifically the other remaining soldiers, Eddie and Melvin (Norm Lewis and Isiah Whitlock Jr.). However, the film's many monologues are always very literate and thought-provoking. After all, with Mr. Lee, it's the message that is of the upmost concern.The director's trademarked continued use of archival footage effectively shows viewers the turbulent era of the sixties for African-Americans, both here and abroad. He chronicles black life and the poor treatment inflicted by the U.S. government. While the assassination of Martin Luther King back home created civil unrest and racial divides, these men were still expected to fight for a country that treated them in second class servitude. Yet sometimes the newsreel montages interfere with the main story and begin to overstate the message, choosing to sacrifice the movie's narrative and plot.The acting is solid throughout the film. Mr. Peters is quite convincing as the troubled Otis who tries to negotiate between all of the bickering. Mr. Boseman, as the doomed soldier, creates a strong impression, although he has less screen time than the others. Mr. Majors is very memorable as Paul's forgotten son and he has some tender scenes with French actress Mélanie Thierry as one of the volunteers that register. One wishes the talented Mr. Lewis and Mr. Whitlock were given more to do with their characters, even though both actors bring needed depth to their perfunctory roles. But it is Mr. Lindo who creates a complex and beaten man just trying to survive. His Paul is haunted and haunting. This excellent actor is outstanding, especially in his lengthy tirades about injustice and his delusional conversations with himself. His performance deserves Oscar recognition.Mr. Lee directs with his usual flair, but the story itself is a jumble at times. The ending seems too glib and uplifting. Its storytelling lacks a true sense of irony, anger, and gravitas which the film wishes to achieve. Still Da 5 Bloods is fine filmmaking, very worthy of your time and support, but my expectations remain higher for this great filmmaker and his vision.",8,0,3,24 June 2020
Annihilation," 2018 Space Oddity
","GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A strange nifty little sci-fi thriller that was wiped off the face of the earth due to bad distribution, and it is not its fault.JIM'S REVIEW: Alex Garfield's Annihilation is a 2018's sci-fi oddity. The backstory of this film is as compelling as the story seen on screen. Perhaps more so. Originally,Netflix purchased the film rights and distribution for this alien thriller. After gaining some positive critical reviews and also some preview audience's negative reaction, the studio lost faith in the movie and disbanded the film in movie theaters less than a month after its premiere. To compensate for a loss, the company then made it a part of its streaming services worldwide (with the exception being its U.S. outlets). The director cried foul of this controversial release method and so did most of the Hollywood elite. He was right.That said, the film itself is a tad odd too. It may not enrapture a mass audience as it tells a well-worn formulaic story of scientists discovering an alien life force that mutates in a section of Planet Earth. Called 'The Shimmer', this glowing quarantined zone is soon being explored by Army Special Forces organized by Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). After months trying to contain this area and all living plant and animal life within. another crew is assembled. This includes Lena (Natalie Portman), a biologist and former soldier whose husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) had previously entered this Area X. Others in this all-female platoon include Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Josie (Tessa Thompson), and Cass (Tuva Novotny). This MeToo Movement quickly becomes a WhoseNext Movement as they battle supernatural forces in a test of survival. So much for women's empowerment!Also strange is the lack of interest by sci-fi fans and moviegoers with this latest journey into the unknown, as it is a well-made and scary little thriller that deserved more attention. (Only 6 other people were in the audience when I viewed the movie.) Sure, there are leaps of logic...many. (Some randoms thoughts: Since others had gone before without any survivors, why was this female quartet better equipped to handle this mission? Shouldn't these scientists be trained to know they are in a contagious area and dress for success? Nary a latex glove in sight. Since the team only traveled with backpacks, where does all the extra gear come from? Does anyone in this movie understand the meaning of the word, 'quarantine'? Wouldn't other war technology such as planes, drones, or jets with missiles be more efficient means of travel? Without sounding too sexist, wouldn't one or two male soldiers be more advantageous for some physical muscle power on this unknown mission? Why is it always so hard to stay with the group when in peril?) Questions left unanswered or poorly explained.The adapted screenplay by Mr. Garfield is based on Jeff VanderMeer's book. Too much time is spent on narrative exposition about genetic science and trying to add some dramatic elements about Lena's human story, which does bring some character development but it also seriously impedes the action. It also takes far too long to finally enter the anomaly, about a half hour into a film that is barely two hours in length. Still, kudos for giving a standard sci-fi thriller come nice dialog, fine acting, and gravitas to this mix.Where the film excels is in its CGI visual images, sound design and Mr. Garfield's artistic flair. The music score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow adds that eerie moodiness and the movie is well edited by Barney Pilling for maximum suspense. The director creates an intelligent and taut creature feature. As his film progresses, many moments are nerve-wrecking and fraught with tension. His memorable climactic showdown between our heroine and the alien life form becomes a lyrically freakish 'dance of death', well choreographed and stylishly realized. Annihilation won't morph or change the sci-fi fantasy genre, but this strange and odd film deserved some love and admiration.NOTE: The end credits are a wonderful light show of extended colors and hypnotic swirls. Stay for it.",8,2,5,26 March 2018
Minions," Mellow Yellow
","(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: Minions has its shortcomings, but it's the other characters that never rise to their level of fun.GRADE: B-Those zany gibberish-speaking yellow creatures are back, this time starring in their own feature length movie. With their limitations fully acknowledged and their inability to speak the King's English as a handicap, could they have enough clout to carry their own film to stardom? The answer to that is still questionable, but Minions is lots of fun as you sit there and ponder the outcome.Their slapstick antics are still pleasant and silly enough to make any moviegoer grin non- stop, even if the screenplay does quite value their worth. The film starts off very well with a short and clever history of their evolution. Narrated by Geoffrey Rush with a crisp British ironic delivery, these henchman search for a master villain to support, from dinosaurs to caveman to the Napoleonic Wars before the film settles in 1968. It is then we meet Kevin, Stuart, and Bob who are sent on a mission to find a diabolical master mind for the tribes' adulation. The trio bungle their way to a Villain-Con convention and into the clutches of the evil Scarlet Overkill and her doltish husband, Herb, whose sole goal is to get the Crown Jewels. (The story predates their loving master, Gru.) Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin direct the animated film and the latter voices the Minions to perfection. The film has a nice visual look throughout. The Minions themselves have individual traits and a variety of expressions that make these lovable characters work extremely well. As long as the film deals with the adorable threesome, their mob mentality and their relationships, the film succeeds. It's the story's slender plot that fails them and the audience.As with most animated films nowadays, the CGI trumps an underdeveloped script. Minions suffers from that malady. Too often the film relies on dumb chases and an annoying soundtrack of 60's pop tunes to add to the supposed merriment. The plot meanders from one situation to the next with no real purpose, adding minor characters that do little to advance the action. The villain isn't the least bit interesting, nor is her mission. The script by Brian Lynch becomes more illogical (even for a cartoon) and less satirical and witty as it finally reaches its clumsy ending. (You actually have seen the funniest parts of this film in its trailer.)Still, Minions is diverting and amusing, even if it never achieves its true potential. Like its overdone 60's score, the film is just too Mellow Yellow.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6,2,4,19 July 2015
Incredibles 2," Just Super
","GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A delightful animated romp with superheroes who save the day.
JIM'S REVIEW: Incredibles 2, writer /director Brad Bird's sequel to his original 2004 film, continues with the right 60's retro vibe from its op and pop art settings, its endearing family of superheroes, and its way-too-cool jazz-infused score by Michael Giacchino . Yes, it was a long wait for its return and the film delivers in its artistry and savvy animation. The plot: It is now illegal to be a superhero. This law includes The Parr clan: Bob a.k.a. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and Helen a.k.a. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) are in hiding and living in a cheap motel, along with their gifted children, moody teenage Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner) and Baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile). Soon they are called upon to legitimize their powers once again, this time by a rich businessman, Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk)) and his inventor sister (Catherine Keener) who will finance their reappearance. They decide to re-package and sell our crusaders to the American public, including their buddy, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), and start their campaign by making Elastigirl the main focus of admiration. This shifts the family dynamics by having Mr. incredible become a stay-at-home dad who morphs into Mr. Mom with harried results, especially since Baby Jack Jack begins to develop his own lethal super powers.Mr. Bird does a masterful job directing the film. His unmistakeable visual look of his film with its dated futuristic viewpoint is stylized pop via George Jetson. Script-wise, his characters' dialog is sharply written too, even if his story does meander, spending too much time with exposition about the arch villain, ScreenSlaver, and the introduction of other superheroes that barely register in personality or interest. Their only purpose is to somewhat complicate the plot and allow for more action scenes. But there is enough wit and humor throughout the movie to sustain the pure joy of gorgeously rendered chase sequences of dare-doings that flow with wonderful movement and clever details. However, some wonderful minor characters are given short rift in this installment due to the narrative. One wishes the likes of Rick Dicker (Jonathan Banks), Underminer (John Ratzenberger), and especially Edith Head look-alike Edna Mode (the multi-talented Mr. Bird himself) had more screen time. If the film had devoted more expansion of those unique figures and less on other newly introduced ones, the film would have been all the more memorable. (Personally, the two highlights for me were not the many chase sequences, though they are so well edited and excitingly staged. No, it was the quieter ones that involved Baby Jack Jack and a feisty raccoon and a truly comic scene with Miss Edna, of course!)Just as the colorful animation is outstanding, so is the voiceover work. Special kudos go out to to Mr. Nelson, Ms. Hunter, Mr. Banks, and the director for their vocal skills. All of the actors do a tremendous job of imbuing the characters so well, Particularly impressive is Mr. Nelson's sleep-deprived fatherly tirade moment which is a perfect blending of voice and animation.Always highly entertaining, Incredibles 2 is a worthy successor in the series. It is a movie filled with much whimsy and one can only delight at all the mischief and antics on display and be in constant awe of the artistic talent emanating from Mr. Bird and the Pixar Studios.NOTE: On a deeper level, this family film says a great deal about our polarized nation and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a conservative outcry about Hollywood's bias and that darn liberal agenda. But putting that bi-partisanship aside, the movie proudly celebrates the importance of family and the need to accept our differences and our individual multicultural talents. Politically speaking, the film's subtle message of unity is so apropos in these troubling times when we can use a courageous superhero (or ethical lawmaker) to change our world and speak out against injustice.",9,1,3,21 June 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," A Song for the Asking
","This film is highly recommended.Written, directed, and edited by the Brothers Coen, Inside Llewyn Davis is an oddball comedy about a self-centered but talented folk singer in the 1960's Greenwich Village. The film lingers over the absurdities of life as its abrasive and unlikable anti-hero tries to find any trace of success in the dark smoke-filled nightclubs that made the New York Village scene such a viable place back then. The film contains many quiet and poetic moments, filled with insightful observations about its characters and that more innocent era.Rumor has it that an artist must suffer for his art. Inside Llewyn Davis embellishes that myth as we moviegoers spend one fateful week with this struggling songwriter and his chance encounters with various people in the music biz. It is Llewyn's winter of discontent. He's out of money and out of patience. Fame continues to elude him but not life's hardships. His musical partner has committed suicide. Llewyn's first solo album is doing poorly in sales and he just may have impregnated his best friend's wife. Llewyn would rather commit to a short song on center stage than care for anybody or anything. Dealing with life's harsh realities are too taxing, even as he is forced to become an unofficial guardian of sorts for a friend's cat, Ulysses. Soon both man and cat are off on their individual odyssey for the meaning of life, but only one will find it.In their nuanced film, Joel and Ethan Coen have added another assortment of quirky characters to their on-going array of bizarre behavior, although this time the central character is more disagreeable than needed. Oscar Isaac plays Llewyn and he gives a solid performance, capturing the talent and the bad luck that befalls his character with a sneer and a sad bitter-more-than-sweet song for the asking. With a terrific film score assembled by T. Bone Burnett and showcasing many of the folk tunes from that era (500 Miles, Fare Thee Well, The Last Thing on My Mind), the film is high on atmosphere and strong on character development. Plot-wise, there's not much to tell, except that the film shows a series of missed opportunities and misadventures for Llewyn, most of which are lessons not learned. Inside Llewyn Davis is more character study and a nostalgic reminder of another time long gone than the traditional action-driven entertainment one would suspect from these filmmakers.Contributing to the film's richness are fine supporting performances by Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake as Jean and Jim, a more popular husband and wife folk duo, Stark Sands as Troy, an up-and coming idealistic song-smith, and a drug-addled John Goodman as Roland Turner, a jazz musician. ￼ This is one of the year's best crafted film. The period details are brilliantly evoked by the moody photography of Bruno Delbonnel, the purposely dated costumes of Mary Zophres, and the essential spot-on production design by Jess Gonchor. There is an genuine authenticity to the film due to their stellar contributions which convincingly portray the American folk scene of 1961.The title character of Inside Llewyn Davis is purposely remote and distant. It's hard getting inside this tortured soul, as he never connects with anyone. Joel and Ethan Coen have created a deeply captivating film that keeps the moviegoer on the outside looking in, observing the characters and appreciating their conversations. We become voyeurs lost in the milieu of the sixties folk scene, always questioning Llewyn's state of mind, well aware that the times are a- changin' around him. Inside Llewyn Davis is wonderful escapist fare and one of the best films of the year.

The Cabin in the Woods," Monster Mash-Up
","This film is not recommended.You've heard the one about the jock, the hottie, the intellectual, the stoner, and the virgin who decided to go have some fun at a remote cabin in the woods. Five go in, and...Well, you've certainly seen variations on this horror theme before, including Friday the 13th, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Scream, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few examples from this overworked genre. Let's face it, whenever nubile teenagers go for a quiet getaway in the deep dark woods, there's got to be danger a mere step or two away. After all, it's not called the WILDerness without good reason. Now I do enjoy the synthetic scare of sitting in a darken theater and jumping in synchronized midair movement along with my fellow moviegoers, as long as the film follows these three basic rules of suspense: Rule No. 1. It builds suspense. ( Usually this is the case in many films, an easy accomplishment with sound effects, sudden staccato music shifts, and darkness all around. ) Rule No. 2. It stays logical until the end. ( Rarely does the end achieve that goal since its beginning phase sets up the heightened tension and higher expectations only to disappoint by the film's gruesome finale. ) Rule No. 3. It doesn't glorify gratuitous gore for violence's sake ( Never happens nowadays, especially if the filmmakers want to see any possible profit ). So, I decided to kill some time and went to see what I thought would be another predictable slasher movie, with perhaps a bit more wit and spine-tingling tension, since it was penned by Joss Whedon of Buffy fame. Well, the film wasn't so much predictable as it was forgettable.Yes,I can now report that The Cabin in the Woods doesn't meet many of those criteria. ( In fact, it only manages to register with the first rule of horror films. ) But the film is still a noble, if disappointing, effort to expand the realm of this genre. It is a spirited diversion and when it stays within its own terror-filled perimeter of the horror school of filmmaking, the film stays effective. Too often, the filmmakers continually undercut the elements of suspense by relying too much on the contrasting images of sci-fi technology.Co-written and directed by Drew Goddard, The Cabin in the Woods brings together the collective teenagers as the typical sacrificial lambs. The lambs for the slaughter are played by Kristen Connolly, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, and a younger Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth, all who have since achieved some fame in television and motion picture projects. ( The film, made in 2008, has been held up for release due to MGM's bankruptcy issues and has finally made it to the big screen after much delay. ) Also in the film are Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, both fine accomplished actors who may bring some stature to the film, but essentially are wasting their talents here. The multi-purpose script shows no real purpose at all. The screenplay tries its darnedest to be hip and innovative in its approach to elevate the horror genre with some comedic moments and action segments. The Cabin in the Woods contains many plot twists and turns ( too many ) which will be more effective for your filmgoing experience with less prior knowledge about the film and its tiered structure. So you'll hear no spoilers from this reviewer except to saw that I was more shocked by the film's positive reviews by the critics that from the antics on display.As the film rambles to its forgone conclusion, Whedon and Goddard throw every possible horror cliché at their movie-going audience, making the film becomes more laughable than scary, particularly with an uncredited cameo that makes the whole enterprise seem even more absurd. The Cabin in the Woods wants to be seen as a clever send-up to all the horror films past, a cagey deconstruction of the splatter film brand of filmmaking. But due to its multi-layering of convoluted plot devices and an uncanny knack for pop culture insights, it just doesn't work. When doing a mash-up of horror and sci-fi staples, both styles of film suffer under their own weight and individual identity. The Cabin in the Woods becomes a bit of a bi-polar mess, a sad little parody of itself. Unfortunately, the joke is on the moviegoers who become the sacrificial lambs that pay full dollar to see this kind of anticlimactic junk. GRADE: CNOTE: The movie poster shows off the gamesmanship and mystery that are an essential part to the film's success. With a side wink to the Rubik Cube phenomenon and a deep appreciation of the work of M.C. Escher, this marketing conceptually targets the right film audience and becomes intriguing art as well. The poster far exceeds the movie's overall effect. Checkmate!NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",4,5,13,17 April 2012
Spectre," Bonded to Its Set Formula
","(Rating: ☆☆½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended. In brief: More of the same, less of the thrillGRADE: B-In the latest film version from the successful James Bond franchise, number 024 to be exact, the formula is king. Heroic spy vs. evil super-villain. Check. Spectacular stunt work and speedy car chases. Check. Intense action sequences and fiery explosions. Check. Exotic locations and political intrigue. Check. Sexy women and double entendres. Check. It's all there and the filmmakers rarely stray from their set course in Sam Mendes' Spectre. That decision may again make the movie a real crowd-pleaser, but it also makes it rather predictable and dull, leaving this reviewer partially shaken but not very stirred.For those of you who do not know the back-story, Spectre has been a global terrorist group that has been in Ian Fleming's novels from its first inception. and Mr. Bond, that is, James Bond, has been on a personal crusade to stop their evildoing. The script takes our resourceful operative to various international locales, from Mexico, London, and Italy to Austria, Tangiers and back to London again, as he battles this organization. This screenplay-by-committee (John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Jez Butterworth, a talented lot) sets up the action in a stunning opening set piece during the Day of the Dead celebration with some nifty helicopter combat. (As we normally expect from the series, the opener is a real zinger which is followed by artsy credits with silhouetted babes and title tune sung by a popular contemporary singer). This leads us to our main story and Bond to his ultimate mission as he tries to discover the whereabouts of the mysterious Franz Oberhauser, the head of this organization, presumed dead. Solidly directed by Mr. Mendes, Spectre is fine entertainment, although it is more of the same and less of the thrill this time around. The actors are all strong in their roles, especially Daniel Craig who single-handedly helped the series' continued success with his modern day spin on our anti-hero. His arch rival, played with standard menace by Christoph Waltz, doesn't have enough screen time to establish his nasty credentials and there needed to be more one-to- one stand-off opportunities between the two characters that are sorely missing. Lea Seydoux as Bond's seductive love interest, as written, hardly registers as Bond-worthy. The chemistry between the two actors never charms and is the chief misstep in this film. Also on hand lending strong support are Ben Whishaw as Q, the nerdy gadget maker, Naomie Harris as his loyal Miss Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes as M, the newly appointed boss of M16, Andrew Scott as C, a global surveillance advocate who wants to phase out the outdated 00 agency, and its license to kill, and the burly Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, a prototype of another previous bad guy from the series named Jaws, here with all the muscle and without the metal dental work that makes Bond's adversary memorable.The action is non-stop, deliciously illogical, and over-the-top as usual. The so-called twist is obvious from the start. The end result is thoroughly expected. The aforementioned script uses its convoluted plot without much of a payoff and tries to establish some character depth but lacks the witty banter and engaging dialog that is part of the series trademark. Instead, its focus is on the many action sequences which are filmed in style by Hoyte van Hoytema. Production values are high and the budget is big and expensively mounted, although Thomas Newton's score remains loud and intrusive throughout the film's long 2½ hour length.Yet, Spectre, while diverting and interesting, fails on its mission to impress moviegoers with any originality and real suspense.

Joy," Mighty Russell Has Struck Out
","(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: Clean-up in Aisle 4GRADE: CThe usually reliable David O. Russell lets down his fine cast of performers in his latest film, Joy, which doesn't quite live up to its title. Except for a strong performance from its lead, the delightful Jennifer Lawrence, the film remains a major disappointment. The film is loosely based on the true story of inventor Joy Mangano, but the screenplay also written by its director is a mess that needs to clean up its act. The film swings wildly between comedy and drama but never stays long enough to be effective in either category. Joy, winningly played by Ms. Lawrence, is interesting and the actress brings some verve to her role, but all of the supporting characters around her are sketchy and never amount to much more than quirky curmudgeons whose actions are so over-the-top that they never resemble anything remotely believable.The plot: Joy's life is in shambles (but then, so is the script). Living slightly above the poverty level and sharing her household with her dysfunctional divorced parents, Terry (Virginia Madsen), a reclusive soap opera addicted mother, and Rudy, a crotchety self-absorbed father (Robert De Niro) who takes up with a rich Italian widow named Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), Joy's ex-husband, Tony (Edgar Ramirez), who is trying to be a professional singer, Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm), her jealous stepsister, and Joy's two adorable children. Still her creative impulses compel her take action and change the direction her life is taking, which leads Joy to her long- time friend and adversary in business, Neil (Bradley Cooper), who gives her moral support on her latest venture. However, none of these relationships build to any satisfactory conclusion due to the stilted writing and uneven tone of the film. The ending also seems pat and forced as it quickly tries to tie up its loose ends, be they cotton or synthetic.With all of the talent involved, sadly, Joy is a joyless filmgoing experience.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4,60,123,19 January 2016
Her," He Said, She Said
","(Recommended) Solidly written and directed by Spike Jonze, Her is an imaginative and thought-provoking thesis about man's dependency with technology. This film questions the typically viewed meaning of love and asks its movie-going audience to do the same. Her has an undercurrent of tragedy and registers its insights with a tinge of sadness in the form of its protagonist. 'Him' is Theodore Twombly (such an apt name for the character), a broken man and lonely soul. Theodore is a man who has lost his wife (and himself) in a messy divorce and can't seem to truly move on and live. He simply exists from day to day, basically friendless and without any real purpose, that is, until he purchases an operating system for his home computer that he more than befriends.'Her' becomes his perfect non-wife, a blending of organizational assistance, a comforting presence, and just the right amount of sex companion as voiced by Scarlet Johanssen as his computer generated software soul-mate, Samantha. Theodore's odd behavior springs from a loneliness and isolation, a desperate need to reach out and touch somebody...anybody. Their relationship forms the basic premise in this modern retelling of the boy-meets-girl theme, except in this case it's boy-meets-machine. Jonze's film takes place in the very near future and takes its inspiration from our increasing dependence of technology and its 21st century need for the latest in gadgetry. This conceit works so effectively and carries with it enough impact today as our connection to others is slowly eroding. Love, and all of its forms, may be all around us, but it comes second hand, replaced by labor-saving conveniences and any other communicative tool at our fingertips.Phoenix's performance is heart-breaking and touching. The actor's subtle facial reactions and body gesture help to foster Theodore's inner pain and misery. His smitten look of romance and sad-sack bewilderment whenever he hears Samantha's come-hither words beckon him closer to an irrational sense of vocal foreplay and sexual satisfaction in this tale of computer addiction and obsession. This is a charismatic and uttering fascinating performance. Johanssen is never seen in the film, but her presence is everywhere. Her voice-over work is so essential to the film's success, bestowing her breathiness and sexuality to her 'character'. Due to our prior knowledge of this actress' screen persona, this transformation intensifies the possibility of true love ways and make the moviegoer believe in their plausible connection.While Jonze sets up an intriguing notion and layers the complicated relationship between man and machine, her takes a far too nonchalant approach to the lover's interplay. The eager acceptance of this unhealthy duo by other romantic couples as being the norm lessens the film's emotional debate. Some scenes have a creepiness when they should be sadder and bittersweet. Fortunately, Jonze's sensitive direction creates a viable world amid the masses of technological excesses that dominates Theodore's ordinary life. As he begins to educate Samantha about his living world, he himself views his surroundings through different eyes (or lenses). The stunning images by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema reinforces Jonzes' script and his central vision.Her keeps on an even keel throughout its length, staying too remote and clinical when more direct conflicts about this relationship could have greatly added to the film's dramatic impact. This is an effective psychological study of a man alone and the human need for love and acceptance. While not entirely satisfying, her is still intriguing and provocative filmmaking.

The Nice Guys," L.A. Inconsequential
","(RATING: ☆½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A bubble-headed rehash of crime thrillers and buddy movies.GRADE: D+SYNOPSIS: Two inept detectives try to unravel a mystery during the groovy 70's.JIM'S REVIEW: Take the popular buddy movies of the 80's, add the retro good vibes of the 70's and quickly stir in the grisly blood and violence of the 90's and voila!...you have a half-baked movie entitled The Nice Guys, a film with no identity to call its own. To any unsuspecting moviegoer sitting through this dreadful rehash, the age-old adage, nice guys finish last, becomes all too true.The setting is L.A. during the mid 70's. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe play misfits Holland March and Jackson Healy, a couple of low-life PIs who join forces to solve a convoluted mystery involving a missing girl, a porn starlet, and how two distinguished actors can pick a real loser. This alleged comedy is directed by Shane Black, whose previous experiences with this crime genre, like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, has shown the filmmaker to have had some relative success. Here, he is more concerned with capturing the seventies era with his references to killer bees, rationed gas lines, disco music, and pong video games than delivering an entertaining and logical film.His screenplay, co-written with Anthony Bagarozzi, is a total mess. Its plot frequently detours to violent chases and shoot-outs as it tries to connect the two unsolved cases and add some far less clever one-liners between the assorted mayhem. The crime and the comedy elements rarely align unless one agree that this comedy is indeed a crime and a waste of time and talent.The casting of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, two actors known more for their heavy dramatic roles rather than their light comic style, seems off from the start. When it comes to the high art of comedy, the track record of both actors is spotty as best. (While Mr. Gosling has had some success in this area, with film projects such as Crazy, Stupid, Love and Lars and the Real Girl, Mr. Crowe's comedy film credits include only Noah, a true laugh-riot.) Together, the two leads have zero chemistry between them. Their foray as two wild and crazy guys is a dismal failure. Their so-called comedy bits are labored and bereft of humor. In fact, in one desperate scene, Mr.Gosling tries to channel the comic timing of Bud Abbott's double takes which elicited groans rather than laughs from the audience members. A paunchy Mr. Crowe is briefly united with an air-brushed Kim Basinger, his LA Confidential co-star, in a brief scene or two. Let us just say time has not been kind to either star and move on from there. In supporting roles, Matt Bomer is underused as John Boy, a paid assassin, and Beau Knapp as a blue-faced killer is more annoying than menacing.The talents of fine actors like Keith David and Lois Smith are squandered in this dud. Only Margaret Qualley as Amelia and Angourie Rice as Holland's wiser-than-her-years teenage daughter create real characters, but that is due to their screen presence rather than the dialog they are spewing. (Both actresses make a strong impression and do deserve better parts.)The film is interminably long, makes absolutely no sense, and has no laughs...none! The Nice Guys makes for miserable company. Avoid.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",3,57,126,19 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Road Rage
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: As reboots go, the crash-and burn crowd will love this epic state-of-the-art film. Others, not so much.GRADE: BThe good news about our bleak future is that even with the limited amount of water and gas, our vehicles will not be gas-guzzlers, will never overheat, and can get at least 200 miles per gallon. Earth may be a wasteland, but you can still get around pretty well. Survival is within one's grasp for the most fast and furious of us all. So throw that logic to the wayside and put your pedal to the metal for George Miller's reboot, Mad Max: Fury Road. (It's the only way you can survive this onslaught of heavy metal.)There's a lot of sound and fury (but not much plot) in the wild steam-punk extravaganza called The CGI and stunt work are jaw-dropping. Shall we say...to the Max? And there is more demolition and destruction per minute than most action films this days as director George Miller brings back his Mad Max saga with a vengeance.Yes, the crash-and burn crowd will have found nirvana with this action thriller, with its big rigs and even bigger wheels, fast motorcycles, and super muscle cars. Other moviegoers looking for more story and substance need not apply. As for me, my feeling were decidedly mixed. I felt somewhat uninvolved with the resulting mayhem on the screen, yet was in awe of the spectacle. Expectations were high for this film, and the film delivers with the non-stop action sequences so unrelenting and well staged. Production values are top-notch all the way. Still a nagging sense of the unfulfilled lingered throughout my movie-going experience. The actors do a credible enough job, especially Charlize Theron. The budget is bigger and one action scene easily tops the next in a giddy childlike craving for more thrills. Had I somehow outgrown the absurd nonsense of the post- apocalyptic future and become desensitized to the carnal violence from years of viewing other action thrillers of the same ilk? Why didn't I get more pleasure from this new and so-called improved version? It is what it is.While visually satisfying for the eye, the mind has no such engagement. Exposition and dialog are at a minimum. The non-existent plot is never fully explained. (There is virtually no deep revenge motive as in the original source. No time for real emotion to be on display; just plenty of car crashes and violent killings.) The whole film is just our anti-hero Max escaping one perilous situation from the next mindless chase scene, albeit stunningly filmed and choreographed. In retrospect, the colorful characters are pale comparisons to Mel Gibson and his cronies. The actors are not at fault; it's the script which sacrifices character development for bigger adrenal-pumped stunts. Tom Hardy takes over the Mad Max role and his interpretation is less sexual cool and more brutish retro hero who speaks in his low raspy voice and grunts his dialog. He is still effective in the role, but he downplays the character to the point of irrelevance and keeps his emoting at bay when the opposite acting choice would have had more impact on the movie-going audience. One rarely empathizes with this updated Max wannabe. Ms. Theron actually has the more showier role as Imperator Furiosa, a female rogue warrior. The actress makes the most of it with her gonzo crazed look, buzz cut and metal arm, and her macho posturing. She brings woman empowerment to another level with her Amazonian crew along for the ride. (Let's here it for the girls!) In fact, Theron's character has more screen presence and steals the film from under Max's grip.Also helping to keep things in motion are Nicholas Hoult as Nux, who plays a psycho sidekick and rightfully overdoes his madness. Hugh Keays-Bryne as Immortan Joe, brings real menace to his villainous one-note role.The director's work remains solid, even if his script (along with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) lacks any real depth. Miller once again captures the surreal qualities from his earlier trilogy and masterfully handles the non-stop action. His use of hyper movement contrasting with slow motion imagery heightens the tension and adds a poetic spin to his vision of scorched vistas and its zombie-like inhabitants. The film is stunning reproduced with all its pyrotechnics and razzle-dazzle. There is an epic beauty about it all. Kudos to the stark production design by Colin Gibson, the frenetic editing by Margaret Sixel and the atmospheric photography by John Seale, all contributing greatly to Miller's absurd world.Mad Max: Fury Road is a mad exhausting romp to the dark side.

Hacksaw Ridge," Hackneyed Ridge
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A well made and effective war film that ultimately loses The Battle of Clichés.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Biography about war hero and pacifist Desmond T. Doss.JIM'S REVIEW: The bullets whiz by at an alarmingly rate, and so do the clichés in Mel Gibson's war epic, Hacksaw Ridge. Based on a true story about Desmond T. Doss, a conscientious objector who fought valiantly in WWII, saved 75 lives, and never carried or fired a rifle. Granted, this is a remarkable tale of valor and courage, but, as written by in his screenplay, rarely registers as a real human being, more like a saintly hero with lots of aura to spare. This Seventh-Day Adventist warrior emanates a distinctive glow throughout the film that distanced this moviegoer to feel any emotional connection.Corporal Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a PATRIOTIC SOLDIER who enlisted in the Army to do his bit for America and fight against THE EVIL Japanese. Of course he runs into some complications due to his religious stance. He runs smack into a TOUGH SERGEANT (Vince Vaughn) and a BULLYING BUNKMATE (Luke Bracey) before hitting the front line. His LOYAL AND LOVING GIRLFRIEND (Teresa Palmer) waits at home while he fights a good fight to stay true to his religious convictions and risk his life numerous times to help others and earning the Purple Heart. The body count rises, along with the clichéd and contrived situations. The set-up is Americana hokum, although based on facts. The screenplay by Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan tells their tale with passion and verve, but the dialog lacks any degree of realism or subtlety. It's a standard WWII biography about a superhero done very well.Mel Gibson directs his film with hundreds of gory close-ups of bodily carnage. His obsession with grisly images never abates, but he does create a powerful war movie. The film is directed with a sure hand, although Mr. Gibson overdoes the religious symbolism with making Desmond such a pious Christ figure to the point of redundancy. The war action sequences are skillfully staged to maximum effect and achieve the right shock value results. Bodies (and body parts) shoot into the air with precision, blood spatters, heads are riddled with bullets as explosions and fire accentuate this balletic dance of death. Other calmer scenes of Desmond's usual earlier years carry with them a nostalgic 1940's glow that contrasts with his dysfunctional family upbringing, also tinged with violence episodes.As our heroic pacifist, Mr. Garfield downplays the country bumpkin elements of his character and makes Desmond more convincing and multi-layered. He gives a totally assured performance and his emotional conflicts resonate with the audience quite effortlessly due to the actor's likable factor. Strong support is also provided by Mr. Vaughn, who avoids his stock character's trademark gruffness with much agility, Sam Worthington as his captain, and Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths as his quarrelsome parents. As his love interest, Ms. Palmer makes Dorothy's kindly stereotype of the girl back home more interesting than her role suggests.Hacksaw Ridge, though well-crafted, is all stereotypes thrown together to tell its war-is-hell theme. Relentless in its violence, and redeemed by Mr. Garfield's earnest performance and strong technical qualities, with fine editing by John Gilbert, impressive photography by Simon Duggan, and rousing sound design. The film is equal parts completely contrived and highly effective. Call it Hackeyed Ridge.",8,1,4,7 February 2017
Me Before You," Love So Lame
","(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5)   THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: There are disabilities aplenty in this sappy screen  adaptation, mostly in its politically- correct thinking.  GRADE: C-  SYNOPSIS: A beautiful caretaker falls in love with her handsome  quadriplegic patient.   JIM'S REVIEW: There have been much talk and many catchy phrases about  the subject of love that have been set to music: 'Love will find a way.  Love hurts. Love makes the world go round. Love will keep us together.  Love the one you're with. True love never runs smooth.' These pop  ditties are never heard in the insufferable tearjerker of a movie  entitled Me Before You. Still they do form the basis for the  relationship of two mismatched beautiful people who become soulmates  amid love's many obstacles.   ￼The story goes like this: Recently unemployed Louisa (Emilia Clarke)  becomes a nursemaid and companion to handsome but clinical depressed  Will Trayor (Sam Clafin), once a rugged sportsman and successful  executive, the whole package, and now a disheartened quadriplegic. Will  has no will to live but Louisa, or Lou as she is lovingly called, is  Little Miss Sunshine personified, a kooky supposedly adorable waif and  perhaps the perfect antidote to Will's bouts of suicide. At least  Will's rich parents hope that Lou will be the cure-all to lift Will's  spirits and change his mind and mood swings. It didn't change mine.  ￼With an abysmal screenplay by Jojo Moyes and based on her best-selling  novel (which I fortunately did not read but am told the book tackles  more serious themes), the film shies away from any semblance of reality  and settles smack dab in the soapiest of waters. I guess every  generation needs its own Love Story, but is it too much to ask for some  darker moments to help us relate to Will's physical condition? One only  hears of, but never sees, Will's pain and suffering.  ￼Yet Will isn't the only one suffering here. Any moviegoer in their  right mind would want to pull the plug on this claptrap. Truthfully,  the whole ethical issue of patient's rights and euthanasia deserves a  fair better and more honest treatment. (That was done in a film called  The Sessions. View that excellent film instead, dear readers.)  ￼But this is suppose to be a love story, the equivalent to a pulpy  romance paperback novel. And on its own terms and genre, the movie  fails miserably, mostly due to insipid directorial debut by Thea  Sharrock, who searches out for the tritest of images and succeeds in  making the bad even worse, laughably outrageous 'exotic' costumes by  Jill Taylor, and the hammiest performance by one of the leads.   ￼Try as he must, Mr. Caiflin does bring some poignancy to his poorly  written character. How he was able to keep a straight face throughout  this film and watch Ms. Clarke overdo her acting in the most ridiculous  of outfits and hair styles would be challenging enough for any actor.  The actress is not helped by her director or costumers. She is seen in  the most garish of garb, from fuzzy colorful sweaters and busy ugly  prints, in outfits any fashionable 13 year old would instantly reject.  Her hair styles range from braids and pigtails to Frau Brucher Germanic  up-dos, which telegraph more emotion than the actress can muster. We  are suppose to be enamored by Lou's quirkiness, but the overall effect  is an off-putting goofiness. Who could blame Will for ending his  life...suicide would be anyone's choice after experiencing Ms. Clarke's  cutesy performance!  If nothing else, there is fine supporting work by Charles Dance, Janet  McTeer, and Brendan Coyle, all distinguished British actors who would  be wise to omit this film from their resume. Also, Stephen Peacocke,  resembling a young Hugh Grant, literally does some heavy lifting and  delivers a nicely nuanced performance as Will's full-time doctor,  Nathan, one of the few subtlest contributions found in this film. (By  the way, in retrospect, everyone is so inexplicably darn good-looking  in this movie.)  ￼With all that is said and done here, writer H. L. Mencken's ultimate  quote of the subject of love may succinctly sum up everything that is  wrong with this silly film: 'Love is a triumph of imagination over  intelligence.' Me Before You has neither of those valued commodities.",4,15,36,14 June 2016
The Great Gatsby," Puttin' on the Glitz
","The film is not recommended.The latest adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel has again transitioned to the silver screen. (There have been 5 previous films, none of which were successful at the box office or achieved critical raves.) Now, the 'enfant terrible' of cinematic excess, Baz Luhrmann, has taken a crack at it, turning the romantic drama into a melodramatic concoction of flappers and booze with a stylish 3-D approach added to his usual opulent visual imagery. The result is like an expensive vodka martini, extra dry, and with enough garnishing to shock Mrs. Astor's pet horse. It easy to liken Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby to an uninvited drunken party guest that you hoped would have left hours ago. It outstays its own visit.Yes, this party goes on far too long, with too many impeccably tailored bystanders in their fancy duds and inebriated guests hanging out just for show. Do the filmmakers capture the circus atmosphere of the twenties and its bacchanalian orgy of carefree decadence? Absolutely. The film looks perfect, but it's all facade. The glitter, and there are tons of it, fades, leaving a rather tame tale in its wake. Do they create compelling dialog, believable characters, and an interesting story? Sorry, old sport!￼For those unaware of the story: It's the Roaring Twenties and everyone wants The American Dream. Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire), cousin to the lovely Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), befriends his rich and mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and gets involved with his hedonistic lifestyle. Gatsby, who has been secretly in love with Daisy for some time, uses Nick's friendship to rekindle this romance. Unfortunately, Daisy is married to a brutish husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton), who is having a affair with a waitress on the other side of the tracks named Myrtle (Isla Fisher). All of these soap opera relationships collide with tragic consequences.Now the underlying power of Fitzgerald's masterwork is in its prose, not in its plot. And the script by Craig Pearce and Luhrmann rarely reaches that level, or any level, of artistry. The film plays like a Cliff Notes version of the novel, relying too heavily on narrative voice-overs and overstated visuals that work on the page but not on the screen. The characters are so one-dimensional and lacking in any nuance. The actors, try as they may, are all constantly upstaged by their opulent surroundings and stilted conversations. ￼DiCaprio is perfectly suited for the role of Gatsby, literally speaking. With his boyish good looks and charming personality, he wears the period costumes well and has enough charisma for his enigmatic character. DiCaprio displays the correct measure of ambiguity and desperation with his portrayal of Gatsby. However Mulligan as his romantic partner lacks the allure and frailty needed to make her character remotely likable. The pairing just doesn't work. Maguire as Nick plays his part with his usual innocent demeanor as he has in past performances, which still works here. The other actors fail to bring any nuance to their sketchy roles, with the exception of Elizabeth Debicki in her short role as Jordan Baker. Edgerton makes his repellent character villainous to the point of caricature as well as Ms. Fisher' as his floozy mistress. However she would be an ideal choice to play Miss Adelaine in a summer stock production of Guys and Dolls.￼As with most of the director's films, production values are flawless. One can see the big budget lavishness in every detail. Costumes and production design by Catherine Martin, Baz talented spouse, is truly stunning. Simon Duggan's vertigo inducing cinematography, though far from subtle, successfully captures the atmosphere and the opulence that was the Jazz Age. The hyperactive editing by Jason Ballantine, Jonathan Redmond, and Matt Villa helps to liven the film's prodding dialog. It is a feast for the eyes.As for the ears...Much has been said about Luhrmann anachronistic use of music, combining today's pop and hip-hop musicians to create new songs for this period piece. (The director used this same approach with his earlier hit, Moulin Rouge, with mixed results.) The same can be said here too. Too often, he overstates his scenes with a soundtrack that telegraphs its message long before its actions.Just as the character of Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald's alter ego in the novel, always appears to be observing the proceedings from the outside looking in. So was I watching this film. Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby never connected to me emotionally. It becomes so overindulgent, like the era it tries to depict. Ultimately, the film is as phony and glib as Gatsby himself. It left me wanted more and wanting less simultaneously, a strange contradiction to a strange and ultimately unsatisfying film. Sorry, old sport! GRADE: C+ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: The 3-D effects truly energize Luhrmann's vision. The director continually plays with foreground and middle ground dynamics which gives the film a unique and slightly artificial theatrical edge which works well with the spectacle. Now, if only the script could provided some of that same passionate spirit.",Null,17,35,11 May 2013
Sully," Hero Worship
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A bio-pic that tells its story concisely but lacks a real  emotional lift-off.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: The true story of Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's emergency  water landing and its aftermath.   JIM'S REVIEW: Everyone needs a hero and Sully is the latest bio-pic  about an American idol. The story is well known, as is the outcome, but  as directed by Clint Eastwood, the film immerses the moviegoer in a  behind-the-scenes glimpse of Sully's saga. In January 2009, this  ordinary man successfully crash-landed his plane into the Hudson River,  saving all 155 lives on board. We witness this 'Miracle on the Hudson',  and view the event both before and after the crash, or as Sully called  it, 'an emergency water landing'. Although the filmmakers smartly stage  the crash in multiple scenes via flashbacks and dream sequences, it  lands squarely on the dramatic after-effects that haunt this aviator.  As Sully and his crew are subjected to a thorough investigation by the  Federal Transportation Safety Board, who become the film heavies in  this movie, the film takes flight, even if it treads too lightly on its  subject.   Played by Tom Hanks, in common man mode, the film aligns us to our hero  from the start. From a competent screenplay by Todd Komarnick, which is  based on Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's own autobiography, there is an  imbalance of the facts by Mr. Eastwood that biases our judgment and  places the moviegoer in direct support of Sully and his actions,  without naturally questioning his decision-making process. (One wonders  if many passengers were injured or died during this crash if the same  public reaction would have happened. So to paint the FTSB as the fall  guys isn't very fair or logical. It is, after all, the procedure that  occurs with any aviation incident. However the doubt factor, flight  simulations, and conjecture of the inquiry does make for good conflict  and compelling personal drama.)  Solidly directed by Mr. Eastwood, the film is very well-crafted. The  CGI is effectively done. The acting by Mr. Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as  Sully's co-pilot, is strong. Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan, Mike O'Malley,  and an underused Laura Linney as Sully's wife are all fine in their  supporting roles.  Yet, emotionally, the film seemed to be stuck in auto-pilot for this  reviewer, a disconnect with the characters' traumatic circumstances.  The narrative structure doesn't follow a linear structure and has  issues with a choppiness as it jumps from the aftermath to the accident  itself and then back to Sully's past life. The episodic script never  quite lands, causing an aloofness in its clinical retelling. The many  plane crash sequences, shown from varying points of view, are overdone,  serving as pure filler.   While the film successfully establishes the personal tension of the  investigation quite effectively, it underplays the dramatic gravitas.  Were more of the screen time spent on this conflict, the film could  have been more directly involving. Less time spent on the actual impact  (of the plane) and more time spent on the personal stakes from the  results of plane crash would have been more powerful for this  moviegoer.  Still, Sully shows a vivid portrait of a nice guy, humble to a fault,  who was thrust into a dire life-and-death situation and survived to  tell his tale. Mr. Eastwood honors him and the first emergency  responders admirably. But depicting the man as less of a saint and more  of a human being could have made this film more believable and  thoroughly engaging. Yes it's a riveting and uplifting story but the  film plays it too safe, looking for that soft place to land.  NOTE: There is a lovely song written by Mr. Eastwood, called Flying  Home, during the end credits. Stay and have a listen.",8,3,9,10 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Dinner is Served
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fun-filled horror film that is more of the same gore and action as expected, but less on originality and cleverness.SYNOPSIS: On a mission to colonize another planet, a crew of astronauts meet some hungry aliens along the way.JIM'S REVIEW: The Alien series has been with us for nearly 40 years since it debuted in 1979. 20th Century Fox rode to the 21st Century and beyond in its own parasitic form, sucking the life out of this initially strong sci-fi horror film series with its sequels and prequels. Except for the original classic by Ridley Scott and its second chapter, the superior Aliens by James Cameron, it has been a downhill slide into mediocrity. Now spawning a total of 5 films on this cat-and- mouse theme, Alien: Covenant becomes No. 6 to enter uncharted territory (excluding the dreadful two Alien vs. Predator rip-offs). It is a worthy chapter to the franchise.I must state that I had high expectations with this project, as this film is again being directed by its talented mentor, Mr. Scott (although he did lose his way in his philosophical mystical prequel, Prometheus, which lost its way from the central premise of his films' success: to scare the hell out of its target audience with blood and gore). Here, he has returned to his winning formula and stays comfortably in its safety zone, (unlike its astronauts), rarely venturing out of the perimeter of originality. We are firmly ensconced in the horror genre on this mission. (Of course, we are not alone...Dinner will be served promptly at 8, or 15 depending on how many crew members will be the main course.)Mr. Scott is always the consummate craftsman. His films, including this one, have a stark beauty filled with wild action that any adrenaline jockey would love. This good-looking film has strong production values as well, including top-notch photography by the capable Dariusz Wolski and concise editing by Pietro Scalia. The director knows how to build tension and creates visuals that are very impressive. (Lest we not forget Artist H. R. Giger's Oscar-winning creature design of the xenomorph which remains the film's chief ace card.) While his screenplay credited to John Logan and Dante Harper is predictable. (Who will be next to suffer a grisly death? Just how dumb are these trained professionals' life-and-death decisions?) Add to that, all of the characters are a standard variety (the heroic captain, the empowered female warrior, the likable sidekick, etc.). But the fun is in the familiarity of the set-up...and the script takes its time developing its characters and plot before providing the scares and cheap thrills. (Just like Alien, the creature finally rears its ugly head about 40 minutes in.)This second prequel continues its tale as it addresses the Prometheus story-line and brings that to a satisfying conclusion. Our story now picks up in 2104, about 15 years later. Its 'new' players fill in quite nicely. Katherine Waterston plays the intrepid Daniels Branson (a.k.a. Ripley) although Ms. Waterson brings enough individuality to claim the role as her own. Joining her on her mission to colonize a new planet are Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Jussie Smollett, Carmen Ejogo, Amy Seimetz, Demian Bichir, and seven other human appetizers that are on the menu. Also going ala carte is Michael Fassbender playing the android, David 8, and his later model, Walter, and he is terrific. The actor steals the movie with his subtle interpretation of both pivotal roles.Yes, there is an abundance of action sequences and scary moments, none of which I will reveal. The film builds tension well throughout its telling, although its many climaxes are a bit of overkill, literally. That said, Alien Covenant conveniently lives off its original 1979 host source and provides enough mayhem, gore, and action for most moviegoers, especially any horror film enthusiast with a taste for bloodshed. Dessert, anyone?",8,15,29,20 May 2017
The Martian," Saving Private Damon: Space Version
","(Rating: â˜†â˜†â˜†Â½ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: Ridley Scott's epic film may not be the most original of tales but it is done with style and technical expertise making it gripping drama.GRADE: B+Our obsession with Mars and space exploration has been instilled with us for decades, particularly starting in the mid-fifties. From Marvin the Martian to War of the Worlds, from Total Recall to Forbidden Planet, from Robinson Crusoe on Mars to Lost in Space, we are eager to travel the unchartered frontier to seek new thrills. Now we can add to this roster of space adventure sagas yet another entry, The Martian.ï¿¼A man lost in space, left to his own wiles to live in space. Such is the less than original premise of Ridley Scott's The Martian, a solid and engrossing tale of survival. In this outer space epic, there are no aliens preying on human flesh or starship battle wars. The dangers in space exploration are evident and shown as real and probable. This is the type of film that computer nerds and sci-fi geeks will love, most moviegoers will greatly admire, and some may get a little bored with the film's lack of action sequences until the film's concluding rescue mission.The Martian is more of the well crafted filmmaking we have come to expect from Ridley Scott. Scott is a talented and astute director and his detailed vision and style is in every frame. In this sci-fi film, he emphasizes the science more than the fiction. He seems a tad preoccupied about the film's authenticity with its scientific concepts and mathematical theories. The Martian takes its subject seriously and celebrates human ingenuity and man's inner courage against all odds with a sincere and honest depiction of one man forced to come to terms with his own mortality.ï¿¼That man, namely Mark Watney, is played by Matt Damon. Left behind after being caught in a storm, the astronaut is left to his own devices. Damon plays his character very well. He becomes the center of the film as he narrates his dilemma via a video log as he counts the days and his rations. His dialog serves as exposition and very clearly explains to the movie-going audience his intriguing thought process. The actor brings his boyish charm and likability to his role. His performance helps to ground the film and gives the audience a hero to root for. There is also fine support from Jessica Chastain as the ship's commander and Chiwetzel Ejiofor as Watney's NASA connection to Earth.ï¿¼The film is technically superb. Its visual effects are impressive throughout and the photography by Dariusz Wolski excels on the three dimensional elements very effectively, with its wide depth of field when showing objects and astronauts floating effortlessly in space or panning the vast panoramic views of the red planet. But the script by Drew Goddard, based on Andy Weir's best seller, is less effective with its stock one dimensional supporting characters that rarely register any sense of reality or personality (the closely-bonded crew, the professionally trained personnel at NASA, the young obsessed genius physicist, etc.) While the film is very well cast (Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, and Kristen Wiig), the actors are not given much to do dramatically than look stern or stoic. It's all a kinda Saving Private Damon's scenario, but it is gripping entertainment nevertheless.ï¿¼The Martian is an intelligent and imaginative retelling of one man's will to live, well worth the trek.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9,2,38,4 October 2015
