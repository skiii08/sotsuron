Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A lock with golden key.
","One of Tarantino's best, Kill Bill Vol. 2 takes a less is more approach. The violence is not nearly as prevalent or bloody, but the adept storytelling and captivating dialogue (with an amazing performance from Uma Thurman) makes this one of the greatest revenge tales ever told.",9,2,5,22 October 2019
Howl's Moving Castle," The one thing you can always count on is that hearts change.
","This movie is gorgeous, even for a Ghibli film. The characters are awesome the mysterious nature of Howl works throughout the movie and Calcifer is super entertaining. The plot is complex but not at all difficult to follow. The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie. Lastly the name is fitting to the movie, I love how much of a role the castle itself plays in the film. It always seems to be interesting in every scene and frequently reveal something new about itself.",9,1,1,24 October 2019
Your Name.," Absolutely well done.
",Sensational. An absolutely unique idea which integrates science with religion besides being a love story from the deepest of the hearts. The animation too is just awesome. An absolute must watch.,9,0,2,23 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not easy to resume the Star Wars universe; indeed, this movie failed.
","Driving too deeply into messy space politics and not spending too much time on the main conflict of its central characters sinks this prequel movie, but it still stands up as one with a great cast, one of the best scores in filmmaking history, as well as one of the best Star Wars villains of all time in Darth Maul, a feat despite his rather limited screentime.",5,0,1,25 October 2019
Catch Me If You Can," An exciting look into a conman's life. DiCaprio is perfect for the role.
","One of my favoerite films even though I can never seem to find what I like about it, The intense race against the law, the brilliant, charming acting of Leo or it's 60s era style, what ever it is an amazing film.",8,2,3,22 October 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," What follows is one breathtaking action sequence after another, each one surpassing the next in thrills.
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime. It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time. The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in. It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience. Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.",10,0,0,2 February 2020
Hereditary," The film successfully invokes true terror that lingers long after the projector flickers dark.
","This messed up film was on my top 9 of 2018. It is a journey and it is only full of dread. There are moments that are too much and it's tough to watch. I get the divided audience review, much like The Witch. It is not straight forward horror and that is hard to gain an audience. Collette should have taken out best actress, her performance is amazing. Byrne is rock solid in support and it's great to see him in a role that deserves his presence. The film spirals to the finale and if you cannot board the train, it won't sit well for you. This is a film that audiences will find in the coming years and I feel the word of mouth will be kind. The critics loved it, but the audience was divided, which is a good thing. It will be reassessed by the audience, not the critics who have tricked the audience into thinking this is a straight forward horror film. The film has all the qualities of a horror classic to endure the test of time and I suspect this will be something of a long term cult classic. Great filmmaking and one film that will sit with you after the conclusion.",10,0,1,6 May 2020
Gravity," Beautiful special effects, and great acting, but very overrated.
","The emotion really wasn't there, but everything else within it was intense. The directing by Alfonso Cuaron couldn't have been done any better. The visuals couldn't have been anymore gorgeous and realistic. All of that comes with a solid neutral script, lots of suspenseful atmosphere, and a strong message on not giving up when all seems lost. How could people call is overrated and boring. It was not a pitch perfect masterpiece, but it is something special.",8,0,0,23 October 2019
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Python successfully lampoon religious attitudes rather than religion itself.
","Life of Brian has all that one would expect from a Monty Python production: satire, absurdity, ridiculousness, irreverence. Beyond that I found the sets to be surprisingly good and I also found the daring to touch on controversial topics to be refreshing in these uptight times.",10,0,1,22 November 2019
Se7en," Worth seeing if you can look past the gruesome details.
","Probably David Fincher's best film next to Fight Club. Seven is a very gruesome film, but is very intriguing to watch with great suspense, performances and a very well written plot. This film features one of the best endings in cinema history as well as being one of the best films in cinema history.",9,2,2,17 November 2019
Unbreakable," With Unbreakable , Mr. Shyamalan establishes himself as a distinctive auteur with a very personal style.
","Another great effort by M. Night Shyamalan. Unbreakable is actually a superhero film, but not in the traditional sense of being a big blockbuster explosion extravaganza. This film has a very well written plot, characters and a twist that'll shock you to a core. Check this gem out.",8,0,0,27 October 2019
Fight Club," An unpredictable movie.
","Everything about Fight Club is simply amazing. The acting, the directing, and the story is simply superb. However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever.",10,2,2,22 October 2019
Akira," A cyberpunk masterpiece.
","Akira is one of the best films that I have ever watched, and is the main reason why I got into the Cyberpunk subgenre. The animation quality, sound design and storyline are amazing and I love how politically and socio-religiously allusive it is. I also love how this film doesn't show a true hero or villain, as each character is flawed in their own personality. Overall, the film is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Cyberpunk or Sci-fi in general.",10,1,7,22 October 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino being Tarantino.
","Absolute masterpiece by Tarantino. Scenes are very well shot and crafted, especially the bar sequence in the middle. There is a great mix of Tarantino action, acting, and storytelling here. Christopher Waltz gives the best performance by far, but the supporting cast are all good. Tarantino always offers original storytelling and it is nice to see this in a franchise driven Hollywood.",10,1,4,22 October 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One is a bright light in the Star Wars canon.
","Really enjoyed this film. The action scenes are good, all the characters are well cast, have depth and are relatable. The scene with Vader at the end is absolutely brilliant, love how it ties into the original trilogy. It's a fantastic story that makes sense while watching, is well paced and had me engaged throughout.",8,2,2,25 October 2019
Rocky V," A sloppy but good-natured reminder of just what it is that has kept Rocky Balboa afloat for 14 years.
",Stallone trades in the ambiance of a big-fight atmosphere for senseless street-fighting. Rocky V is an unacceptable installment that tarnishes the already back-down-on-his-luck fighter. The uninspiring acting and street-smart vibe is just as damaging as the fighter's brain in this film. But though the film has some significant damages it still manages to be somewhat uplifting with the lack of magic it possessed.,5,0,1,9 November 2019
Us," The film plods along, repeating the same beats over and over, until Peele decides somewhat arbitrarily to just get it over with.
","Jordan Peele follows up his breakout hit, Get Out, with the psychological horror-thriller Us. While on vacation a family is attacked by what appear to be their doppelgangers. The script is a little weak and opens up a lot more questions than it can answer. However, the performances are pretty decent (some are downright terrifying). And though the 'privilege' allegory is a little muddled, Peele does a good job at building suspense and tension. Additionally, the violence is pretty intense without being gratuitous or exploitative. While there are parts of Us that don't work, overall it's a chilling horror film.",6,0,1,24 November 2019
Creed," Creed is perfect. This moment is perfect. I hope Creed II is anywhere near as intoxicating.
","After the last Rocky film was already pretty strong this is another example of sequels not necessarily being pointless nostalgia but in best case adding new layers to a franchise. Sure, we have the usual ingredients of boxer films here as well, that's a tad predictable. But it's all so well done and performed, especially by Stallone, that you're glad you're along for the ride. The music is another great feature, both referencing the classic Rocky scores and going new ways. A very satisfying and enthralling new installment.",9,1,1,9 November 2019
Dead Poets Society," O Captain ! My Captain !
","Dead Poets Society drew me in from the very beginning. This captivating film stands apart from other movies as one of those rare, inspirational films with the power to change your life. I very much enjoyed watching this coming-of-age film about a group of boys on their transition to adulthood. Brilliantly made, the reality of the boys' eventful lives will make you laugh and make you cry. I loved it and after seeing this film, it now holds a place in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.",10,0,1,23 October 2019
Spotlight," Fascinating story presented in a genius way.
",This was an incredibly well made and well acted movie about the horrifying true story of child abuse in the Catholic Church. The movie did an incredible job showing the Boston Globe's efforts in handling the story the right way. One of the best dramas/bio-pics I've seen in a long time,9,0,0,25 October 2019
Aquaman," A thoroughly entertaining ride.
","Sure, this is no smart or particularly clever film. But you gotta admire how it embraces its comic origins, tacky costumes with colorful oversized helmets, octopuses playing drums, Dolph Lundgren with pink hair, armored sea horses and all. Thankfully it doesn't take itself too seriously and has a pretty charismatic leading man who takes the film through a few silly scenes too. But you can't say you've seen most of this ever before, there are just so many locations, creatures, designs, concepts. It's no short movie by any means, but it's fun from beginning to end.",7,1,3,27 October 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," Simple and charming.
","Capturing the beauty of childhood through nature with heavy doses of spiritualism, this enchanting animation is everything that a children's movie should be. It proves that experience can be gained from non threatening situations, and that learning can occur while preserving innocence. It's a welcome break from Western approaches to the genre, avoiding any gloom whatsoever in favor of playful wisdom.",9,1,2,24 October 2019
Zodiac," Gyllenhaal always manages to present a person of some sensitivity without leaning on actorish resources.
","It was brilliant in the sense that it will keep you on the edge of your seat with mainly just smart and sharp dialogues. That is the magic of having a good cast, fine writing, and skillful directing.",8,0,0,19 November 2019
The Prestige," Gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny.
","The Prestige gets right to the heart of why we even watch movies in the first place, and does so in a way that is both intellectually stimulating, deeply moving, and completely paradoxical. Nolan demonstrates a rare and truly deep understanding of the human condition in a most rewarding and honest way. This sublime accomplishment is sadly overlooked.",9,1,4,17 November 2019
Ready Player One," Spielberg fantasy fueled by nostalgia. A blast of pop culture powered sequences.
","A whimsical slice of sci-fi adventure. Reasonable acting and the polished visuals we all expect from Spielberg. I suspect I would have given it less stars if I wasn't fond of the 80s and 90s childhood experience. For better or worse the film draws extensively on childhood tropes and memories of that era. I think it would be a solid film without that notstalgia, but if that is your flavour of childhood wonder, you'll really enjoy Ready Player One. The acting overall was okay. The villain was vanilla and I am not sure the script gives the emotional range needed for the protagonists to shine. What the film does do right though is that it is emmersive and fun. Oasis is believable and the rules of this not so far away future internally work, well enough at least. The visuals are pretty and can go way over the top without being disruptive to the flow and tempo of the movie. It spoils little to say the movie is basically watching an 80s video game unfold. This combined with a thorough PG tone maybe limits the film's emotional pay off but I think it just made it more fun. This is movie that did fun well. A worthwhile watch and highly recommended for anyone whose inner child craves a flash back to their favourite 80s and 90s nostalgia.",7,0,0,21 January 2020
The Hateful Eight," It's like a violent play with crazy characters.
","Although it may have quite a slow start, The Hateful Eight pulls through in the end and makes up for a slightly boring while with an extremely bloody Tarantino-esque climax.",8,1,2,22 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," It falls short of the first two, but it's still a satisfying end to the classic trilogy.
",This is definitely one of my favorites! While not like Empire Strikes Back it's still great! The Emperor is shown in person and even though he is a frail old man he is also very dangerous! Darth Vader also is really good as he is more emotional as he struggles between dark and light! This is the second great one after Empire Strikes Back! It's far from the best though as there are so many other Star Wars movies like 'Rogue One'! It is still very memorable and I love the Ewoks !,8,0,2,25 October 2019
Alien," This film is one of the best of its genre.
","This movie has suspense, action, and anything else you'd want from a film with a genre tag of 'sci-fi/horror.' Such a great film all around and of course the dinner scene is classic. If you love science fiction and haven't seen this movie.. well, then I guess you really don't love Sci-Fi.",9,0,1,31 October 2019
Shutter Island," Very underrated. I Think is a Psychological Masterpiece !
",An absolutely fantastic film. The plot is intentionally difficult to understand and forces you to rethink what you think you know. The payoff is solid and makes the entire movie make perfect sense. The suttle details of this film are phenomenal and you'll find more and more detail with every watch. Leonardo DiCaprio deleivers an exceptional performance that may be one of his best. Overall this film will leave you asking so many fascinating questions and its well worth a watch.,9,0,1,22 October 2019
Life of Pi," One of the most stunningly beautiful films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.
","'Life of Pi' is a philosophical movie about a journey and relationship between a boy and tiger, with beautiful visuals, and great cinematography. In addition to a mindblowing performance by Suraj Sharma, this movie encourages you to talk about how extraordinary a journey would be God's intervention. But, this is a movie. The audience could see from what point of view this film goes. And I love it. I thought this was just a film about survival on the ocean. Yet, I was wrong. This is why filmmaking exists.",10,0,0,26 October 2019
Interstellar," What a piece of art this film is, absolutely incredible.
","One of the greatest sci-fi movies I have ever seen. This movie has the greatest story-line of any space movie ever created, and provokes thoughts and ideas that truly bring out how we see the universe and strives on the importance of how fragile our world truly is.",9,2,3,22 October 2019
Rocky II," Pretty good sequel, among several that followed, this time directed by Stallone.
",Sylvester Stallone is a knockout punch in front and behind the camera as he directs the sequel to his Oscar-winning-hay-maker. Rocky II is somewhat predictable in its story but is held up by it's glorifying humility and visual presentation.,8,0,0,9 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Allowing for some dull moments, this movie has considerable visual style.
","This was George Lucas's attempt to appease the fans for what he did in Episode I. Despite the film being better, it still felt a little flat. The story deepened a bit and Ewan McGregor still turned in a very strong performance as Obi Wan Kenobi, but Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin Skywalker seemed very 'emo' and whiny. Maybe this was the director and the script's fault, but Christensen turned many (including myself) off to this character. Best part of the film is the Count Dooku lightsaber duel at the end of the film. Many did NOT see it coming and it was pretty enjoyable.",6,1,3,25 October 2019
The Aviator," Very interesting and historical character!
","DiCaprio and Blanchett are suburb in this biopic by Director Martin Scorsese. From the airplane crashes that he survives to his Senate testimony that led to the political demise of the senator who called for special hearings against Howard Hughes, this film delivers.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
Léon: The Professional," Like Quentin Tarantino, Besson has a singular style and directorial sensibility that keeps you watching.
","With memorable acting, score, a touching story and characters, the movie is a must watch and a great classic. Also, what's not to love about young Natalie Portman!",10,1,1,17 November 2019
Bird Box," The Beginning is ok but then it turned out to be horrible.
","It is obvious that they took the idea of 'A Quiet Place' but using the vision sense. However it isn't as much compelling, thrilling and well acted as that movie. Honestly I was just hoping that it ended.",6,0,1,23 October 2019
Watchmen," One of the best Super Heroes movies of all time.
",Great. Watchmen is a beautiful looking movie. The best thing is that Zack Snyder made a 'Motion Comic'. I think this is one of the best superheroes movies out there and it's sad that this Film is so underrated. But really I was surprised how Snyder made this Film. Like the graphic Novel. Watch this Film.,8,9,14,24 October 2019
Baby Driver," One of the best action movies in a very long time !
","It's fast, fun, exciting and 'so damn cool !'. With perfect editing that meshes with is great soundtrack and directing, Baby Driver is an excellent action movie filled with style to spare.",8,2,5,26 October 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The first part of the best movie trilogy ever made.
","One of my favorite film franchises of all time. Somehow, this movie manages to cut much of the debilitating magnitude of the novel and still provide a faithful, perfect adaptation, with amazing performances by each and every actor, bringing Tolkien's lovable, unique characters to life. From the very first moments of the film, you know this series will be a great adaptation of Tolkien's profound high fantasy novel.",9,0,0,22 October 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," OK, it's a good closing.
","I don't know what's so 'disappointing' about this third installment comparing to the second one. To me it's practically the same, like two parts of one story (which they are actually). But, it's true, it's even more CGI-ed than 'Reloaded'.",7,1,2,22 October 2019
The Revenant," It's basically a bleak, survival western and it's beautiful & awesome.
",Great film. Well done and very cinematic. Great performance from Leonardo DeCaprio. The film had a great build and just the right amount of action and suspense . Beautifully shot and edited. Would recommend to anyone of a mature age.,8,1,2,22 October 2019
Split," Split is deeply weird, cheerfully perverse, and way, way over the top. It's also a hell of a lot of fun.
","This is mostly McAvoy's show, giving a stellar performance as a dozen split personalities, but the rest of the characters and actresses have their moments to shine too. Shyamalan has never been this sincere and focused, not even in his brilliant first few films. And then there is the final moment, starting with the musical reference, that connects this brutal, exciting and fascinating tour de force with a former hit. That's such a massive goosebump inducing moment.",7,1,1,27 October 2019
The Shining," Still creepy and terrifying after all these years. Outstanding performances !
","When you talk about the best horror films of all time such as The Exorcist or Evil Dead, you cannot exclude Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. What. A. Masterpiece. This film encompasses the very answer to classic horror, with unforgettable acting by Jack Nicholson and an inevitable sense of terror within the setting of this film. The descent into madness becomes unsettling thanks to the phenomenal music, tension and cinematography. There are so many references in this film that it leaves such ambiguity, and it makes us come back to rewatch it again and again to try to understand Kubrick's messages. You cannot miss this film as it will continue to inspire other horror films to come with its elements, acting and atmosphere.",8,0,1,23 October 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The best Spiderman film ever made.
","In an overcrowded and oversaturated mess of superhero movies, Its easy to overlook Spiderman Into the Spiderverse and pass it off as 'just another silly superhero movie' but this movie is really in a league of its own. Fantastic animation that blends countless art styles into one beautiful picture and an amazing story that really explores some of the uncharted territories in character development when it comes to an origin story.",10,0,0,22 October 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," Writer-director Russell is just the guy to bring out (and then calm) the manic dysfunction in these folks.
","I found 'Linings' an interesting movie with pros and cons. Pros: Dealing with mental illness - and hope for the future; interesting to see Lawrence in a role so different than Hunger Games. Cons: When I read the various comments and history of the film, it was nominated for so many Academy Awards? Really? Didn't seem that special.",7,1,2,8 November 2019
Rocky IV," It's a bad movie, no doubt, but at the same time, and somewhat paradoxically, it's also a great movie. Figure that one out.
","Rocky IV, no doubt, has its motivational and somewhat inspirational moments during its climatic scenes, but it is knocked down by its inconsistent direction and cheesy cliched montages. This fourth installment does induce some patriotism (Cold War era) but doesn't fully satisfy or have the 'eye of the tiger'.",8,1,2,9 November 2019
Dunkirk," Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.
","Extremely powerful and exciting war movie about the evacuation during WW2. Driven by a non-chronological narrative in three point of views, the breathless editing and a nerve-wracking score the film delivers several nail-biting sequences and a very powerful and emotional ending. The cast mostly relies on no names and very few stars, all bringing very convincing performances to the table. Additionally, the film is beautifully shot. Another masterpiece by Nolan and a highlight of the genre.",8,2,4,27 October 2019
Spirited Away," Heartwarming and memorable.
","As much of a wonderfully entertaining film as it is a rewarding experience, full of moments of awe and enchantment that by the time the end credits stop rolling it feels like a journey of its own.",10,0,0,23 October 2019
No Country for Old Men," Bardem's superb acting just takes this film to a whole new level.
","This movie holds up incredibly well. Even many years later, the film stands strong and murders the audience expectations. The strong point of uncomfortable silence really adds so much to the movie. Fantastic.",9,3,3,24 October 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The desolation of Peter Jackson
","The Desolation of Peter Jackson's Integrity. This movie is full of bloat in all the wrong places, and then rushes through the parts that matter. The dwarves go from spiders to dead Smaug in less than a week.",5,1,2,22 October 2019
Batman Begins," One of the best origin stories.
","Batman Begins was quite an exceptional movie. Even though it had so many story lines with it, it was quite an excellent movie. It tried to make us understand what it takes to become Batman and it doesn't let up. Mostly everything was right on point. Not really a bad point in this as it's comprehendingly excellent.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I loved revisiting Middle Earth. Not quite as good as the originals, but I still loved it.
","By far the best of the Hobbit film trilogy. This movie brings a lot of the magic that the original Lord of the Rings films brought. However, at times it gets lengthy, childish, and a bit CGI heavy, which seems inconsistent and can bring one out of the escapism. Aside from a few scenes here and there though, much of this movie is perfect! (Especially the scenes in the Shire and the scene with Gollum!)",8,0,1,22 October 2019
Saving Private Ryan," More than a movie, it's an experience that will stick with you for a lifetime !
",By far the most captivating war time movie to date. With a great cast that really help put into perspective the effect war has on everyone and the amount of losses that could happen at any moment. It shows Spielberg at his prime and all the effort everyone put into the movie to make it as realistic and atmospheric as it is.,9,4,6,25 October 2019
City of God," A phenomenal coming of age story. A very authentic and genuine movie.
","Dark, disturbing, powerful, and often funny, City of God is a totally immersive tale, complimented by naturalistic performances and inventive, almost Guy Ritchie-esque camera work. It can be a little bit difficult to follow who exactly is who among the huge roster of characters, but fortunately their colorful names and fleshed out personalities help keep them straight.",9,0,0,22 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's 9th feature is his most pared back, thoughtful and perhaps personal work to date.
","Revolving around and driven entirely by its characters, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' has no discernible narrative to follow and certainly breaks the mould. It's exactly those qualities that will put some off, especially those expecting something more familiar and less tame. That being said, I personally think Tarantino has, once again, delivered a gem of a film with masterful writing and directing (the characters, the production design, the visuals, the soundtrack - I love it all), as well as magnetic work from an insanely talented cast who fill the screen with charisma. What it really is, is a look at a particular time in Hollywood history as seen through the iconic director's eyes - a strange and unusual love letter to it, so to say - and that won't be for everyone. For me, it was captivating from its beginning to its very Tarantino-esque ending that was the icing on the cake.",10,14,18,15 April 2020
Django Unchained," One of the best modern westerns !
","Led by an incredibly charismatic performance from Jamie Foxx, Django Unchained is one of the best modern Westerns. The action, dialogue, and dark humor are exactly what you'd expect from Tarantino - mixed together perfectly.",9,1,4,22 October 2019
Good Will Hunting," A life lesson !
",Robin Williams gives the best performance of his career alongside memorable performances from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. This masterpiece will have you laughing and crying and by the end feeling reborn.,10,2,3,22 October 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better than the first time. A never aging award winning classic.
","The quest to destroy the One Ring continues. This part of the trilogy fully introduces us to Smeagol/Gollum in the form of the brilliant Andy Serkis. We also get to see The Battle of Helm's Deep play out, not to mention an army of ents laying siege to Saruman's fortress, Orthanc, to Howard Shore's wonderful musical score. Like the previous film, this is a masterpiece.",9,1,2,22 October 2019
1917," From the sole perspective of the filmmaking craft, '1917' is worth a watch.
","Not since All Quiet on the Western Front has there been a greater World War I movie than 1917. The film's famous one shot is absolutely brilliant, seemingly unedited and delivering the best angles at any given time. The production design is spectacular, the score is suitably intense, the acting is so strong and underappreciated, the direction is amazing, and some of the imagery here, especially the fire scene, felt truly artistic. But the movie is so much more than just this unprecedented technical achievement. It is a film about brotherhood and friendship, it's downright heartbreaking in some scenes and its most impressive achievement is how it was conceptualized as an immersive adventure film and an exciting video game. The ending is emotional, the night sequence is incredibly suspenseful and the abandoned barracks scene is unforgettable in its entirety. Consequently, Sam Mendes here directed his magnum opus and one grand war picture for the ages.",8,0,2,2 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Thoughtfully humane and visually epic.
","Rather underwhelming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens. None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage, Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connection, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren, etc. The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same. In fact, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones. Still, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic. And the special effects are especially well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs. While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much).",7,3,11,25 October 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A cultural landmark.
","Probably in my top 3 Tarantino films, an epic martial arts revenge film depicting the journey of **BEEP** as she seeks out the vermin who left her in a 4 year coma. Featuring an amalgamation of Japanese Samurai, Kung Fu, Western, 70s film influences, Kill Bill is an inspiring, thrilling, entertaining, emotional film, that if released in 2019, would be considered a woke display of female determination.",9,1,2,22 October 2019
Logan," Jackman twists the pain at the centre of the hero's struggle into remarkably uncomfortable places for a blockbuster.
",The X-Men universe is so good and Logan was one way to end a chapter in tears. It was very good but it sucked to see your favorite heroes old and unable to do the amazing things they used to do with zero effort. The plot is good and it relates to relationships Wolverine has with everyone in the movie.,9,0,0,4 November 2019
The Dark Knight," The definitive Batman movie.
",This movie is a definition of masterpiece and peak of Cinema. The villain in this movie is well developed and takes a new and thrilling approach to the Joker thanks to Nolan's writing and Ledger's acting. The characters in this movie are amazingly written and portrayed. The story serves as a sequel to Batman Begins but has its own plot so you can understand 95% of the story without watching Batman Begins.,10,4,4,22 October 2019
Blood Diamond," It sure raises some awareness about various issues in Africa !
","Blood Diamond, have some great performances on it, it's a compelling story about a hard to talk problem that had or keeps happening on the real world, which make this movie so intense.",8,2,2,22 October 2019
Midsommar," Midsommar is a waking nightmare and I mean that in the best possible way.
","Midsommar is an extremely well made film. The camerawork is amazing. There are so many beautiful long takes with the camera methodically moving in and out. The setting is stunning. It's filled with sunlight, healthy grass, and beautiful flowers. The camera makes sure to let you know that there something more sinister brewing. The film is filled with foreshadowing and subtle hints. The entire plot is shown through paintings and things that people say, which might seem unimportant. Phenomenal movie with so much depth to it. It's one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again without losing interest. Ari Aster's films are on another level. Midsommar isn't for everyone, but if you're a fan of more intense slow burn movies I 100% recommend seeing it. Even if you're not into this genre take a chance on Midsommar. It's worth it.",9,2,6,15 April 2020
Avatar," This movie was ahead of it's time when released.
","This is the movie that would end changing the film industry forever. After this movie was released in the cinema, it became incredibly popular to give movies 3D releases, however, they still don't know how to make the 3D look as good as it did in this movie. This is a visual masterpiece and you can thank James Cameron for his persistance and his vision that eventually enabled this masterpiece to be shown on the big screen. The movie has some very good performances, but the best performance is given by Stephen Lang who plays the main antagonist in the movie. He gives so much of himself in this performance and really nails the motivation and the villainous nature that this character needs. The story is, however, a very classic and it's something that we have seen 100 times before. The movie is a visual masterpiece, but the story really lacks something new and my only prayer for the next couple of movies is that Cameron comes up with better and original stories.",9,2,4,26 October 2019
La La Land," The story is full of imagination but realistic at the same time.
","While the storyline may not be appreciated by all who watch this film, there is no denying this is one masterpiece of a film. Chazelle's use of colour, sound and light are some of the most creative I've ever seen. The cinematography was used very creatively to work with the other visual components of the film. Both Gosling and Stone give terrific performances and perfectly showcase their skills in both acting and singing. Ultimately, a very enjoyable cinematic experience.",9,3,4,23 October 2019
A Clockwork Orange," A cult classic filled with ultra violence and classical music.
","This film is a classic, a film that every cinephile or moviegoer should see, with a strong criticism towards the society we have today, and that this film is from 1971. The only problem I find are some performances, it's probably a personal problem, but I can not help but see that several of the performances are uncomfortable, like PR Deltoid, and others that are unintentional, and soulless, like the performances of Alex DeLarge's parents.",10,0,0,22 October 2019
The King," It is a grand, thoroughly gripping historical drama.
","When together, Chalamet and Edgerton steel scenes, and the fighting sequences are glorious in their own right; however this adaptation of Shakespeare's classic proves too slow a burn, and lacks much emotional engagement, leading us through a story as muddled and unhinged as its titular character.",7,2,4,9 November 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A different assault movie.
","A heist movie where you never see the heist, just the lead-up and the aftermath, from multiple perspectives.Tense, bloody, and with excellent dialogue, the writing carries this film as much as the acting. This opened Tarantino's filmmaking career on a high.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
Rocky," The script is dazzling, with wonderful one liners and moments of real charm.
","What more can be said about this classic? It spawend a franchise that i feel has been so natural from the second all the way to Creed. But as for the movie itself, its top noch, the craftsman ship put into Stallone's passion project really shows, and it succeeds. Stallone is a fantastic writer. more then people give him credit for.",10,0,0,9 November 2019
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's best work.
","Unique film structure, entertaining characters, and much more are present in this Tarantino classic. I find myself always wanting to watch this movie more and more to find new details. Arguably one of the greatest films to ever be released.",10,1,2,22 October 2019
Titanic," Best James Cameron movie in my personal opinion.
","Hands down one of the best romance films ever made, Titanic is an epic, action-packed historical love story that delivers in every single way. Brilliant performance by Kate Winslet, beautiful and accurate costumes, feminist undertones, heart-wrenching, and golden to its core! Titanic is one of the greatest films ever made and that's all that has to be said.",10,8,10,22 October 2019
Rocky III," Bigger but not better.
","An unnecessary but entertaining chapter to the Rocky saga. Stallone laces up the gloves again. A very cliche and somewhat-misdirected plot, dialogue and moral knocks it down, but the energetic action and boxing drama and glory brings it back up and continues to swing to the final bell.",7,2,2,9 November 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," Not as amazing as the first, but still a great continuation of the mythology.
","The style of Reloaded makes it its own film in comparison to the first. Some moments exceed the first, while others are dumbed down to the point where you wonder what they were thinking. Despite its flaws, Reloaded remains just as nostalgic, a fond memory of a time when I was almost obsessed with this trilogy.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
The Departed," The Departed remains a rousing film.
","Another uppercut by the film don himself, Martin Scorsese. In my opinion, there is no faults with this film. I enjoyed every minute of 'The Departed' and I recommend this along with many of Mr. Scorsese's films as a must-watch. A crown jewel in cinema, a film that will stay with me forever. An awe-inspiring piece of moving image art that questions peoples' morality and trust.",10,2,3,4 April 2020
The Witch," The Witch is visually resplendent, aurally meticulous, and singularly crafted to evoke dread from opening to close.
","Big fan of this movie. Fantastic acting by Anya Taylor-Joy (Thomasin), Ralph Ineson (the father, William), the adorably diabolical twins, and of course, Black Phillip. Much like other recent A24 horror films like Hereditary and Midsommar, it is more of a slow-burn movie and also shares a bit of a 'left-turn' ending that I wasn't crazy about. Still, as a whole it was great and is one of my favorite horror films.",8,2,5,15 April 2020
12 Years a Slave," Brilliant , humbling and brutally honest .
","It is not the depiction of physical and mental torture that makes 12 Years a Slave incredible, but by the fine performances that are in it. Slavery is still a modern-world concern, and it shows just how much evil a human being is capable of. If only people can realize that any living soul is worth freeing from oppression.",9,1,1,24 October 2019
Joker," A movie that borders on genius-repellant, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable.
","Phoenix deserves all the glory that he is receiving for this role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside his usual comedy films. Joker is insane and utterly unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, it has paid off. A darker DCEU was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of idea's. Joker is interesting and thought provoking, something the MCU can only dream about. The Black Panther is not the Joker by any means, so expect to see this sitting at the Oscars. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratch Catcher be introduced in the future films? This could be a way of DC and WB separating from the core Marvel comparison. Lower budget, adult focused films. Time will tell.",10,3,4,21 October 2019
Whiplash," A modern day classic and JK Simmons is nothing short of brilliant !
",In this movie we can see the spectacular performance of Teller and Simmons in a drama jazz movie. The Big Band music an the performance of the musicians makes you want more from this movie.This movie reminds you how hard can the life be with you and how you can beat this challenges no matter how difficult it could be.,9,0,0,24 October 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," I wish I could dance like DiCaprio !
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill have great chemistry in this film. Its slow to start but once it picks up, it doesn't stop. It's a little long but if your willing to sit through 3 hours, then you will enjoy this movie. Jonah hill again showed he can be more than just the funny guy in a movie.",9,1,2,22 October 2019
The Green Mile," That was one of the most beautiful story ever made.
","This movie is long, disturbing, but beautiful all the same. Every scene will leave an impact on you, in ways you were not expecting. Having the very realistic environment and characters contrast so well with the ideologies of magic, truly does, make this movie magical.",9,1,2,23 October 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Unecessary epilogue haphazardly slapped together. Only 10 minutes could be salvaged.
","Over-bloated, disappointing finale to Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth. I expected Desolation of Smaug to be the finale, no, they just decided to make 5 pages of the book a 3 hour movie with extreme liberties from the book, absolutely disappointing to say that this movie would be a bit better if you're drunk.",6,1,2,22 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A dramatically cogent and highly satisfying finale to the Star Wars saga.
","The best out of the prequels by far, A nice easy plot this time not full of council meetings although they're not scrapped completly, The effects were top class but it seems George Lucas can't make a film without making just about everything with them, For me it was the worst acted as I thought some of the performances felt very forced (No pun intended) It's full of action from the word go and all was good fun, It's the darkest Star Wars film ever and it worked well what with little to no humour and Jar Jar Binks being reduced to a cameo so you got to love that, A fantastic final few scenes, Very emotional too, Revenge of the Sith can be proud of becoming a true Star Wars film even if it does have its flaws.",7,0,0,25 October 2019
Inception," Beautifully executed and intellectually challenging.
","Inception is one of those films you can't take your eyes and ears off of. Everything requires your attention in order to understand it. But once you do, you discover an incredible sci-fi action flick that has very interesting ideas and some of the best special effects to hit the big screen.",9,0,0,22 October 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Masterpiece.
","The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination. Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling, and satisfying story it entails.",10,2,3,22 October 2019
Parasite," It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.
","It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious 'haves vs. have-nots' one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time.",10,10,14,3 February 2020
Platoon," Although Platoon is not the easiest film to watch, it is one of the best at reminding us that the cinema is not always interested in evading or distorting history.
","Platoon is so much more than just your average war film. This is actually rather intelligent, both in its plot and technical execution. It's the Vietnam War, we follow a platoon of US soldiers as they attempt to wipe out the enemy. The question that this film raises is: who really is the enemy? You have the conflict of the war itself (America against Vietnam) but within the platoon is a conflict for authority. Split between what is right and what is wrong, the moral implications of this war have taken effect on several soldiers as they question their choices. This was a smart element to include within the plot, it was easier to establish character development and build some tension. The majority of the characters were sufficiently developed and their personalities had charisma. This was mostly down to the great cast. Willem Dafoe was easily the best performance, Tom Berenger was also decent and the heated chemistry between them was well conveyed. Oliver Stone's direction was solid, very realistic and gritty. The makeup effects were practical, the wounds and blown up limbs looked pretty damn realistic. A standout scene was the raiding of the Vietnamese village. This was the turning point where actually the American side were perceived as the antagonists, clearly communicating with our inner moral compasses. Effective, very effective. This is easily one of the best war films I've seen and winning Best Picture was fully justified.",9,1,2,1 February 2020
Wonder Woman," Gal Gadot !
",The movie is at its best when it focuses on the quieter character moments and when it embraces the weirder elements of the comics (the prominent use of the 'Lasso of Truth' is wonderful) some of the action sequences are a little flat but that's to be expected.,8,4,21,27 October 2019
Marriage Story," At its best, this movie is searing. It pinpoints many of the little talked-about aspects of divorce that seem the least significant but hurt the most.
","Driver and Johansson will surely receive all the nominations for their great performances in this film, but Laura Dern and Alan Alda also deserve tons of credit for the job they do. The story is well written for both the husband and the wife's perspective. It almost hurts to watch it at times but in the best way possible. The audience is somehow led to root for both sides, accepting both characters' strengths and flaws. An extremely well-acted, and pretty well-written film.",9,7,10,15 January 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," What an incredible ending to an amazing trilogy.
","The conclusion of the Dark Knight trilogy goes out in style. While I wouldn't quite put it on the same level as the Dark Knight, it is thoughtful and entertaining in equal measure. Hans Zimmer delivers his absolute best soundtrack in the trilogy, while Tom Hardy is great as Bane.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
Creed II," It is a solid movie that further cements Jordan as a star, and that's mostly because of how he portrays Donnie's personal development.
","A powerful sports drama, Creed II is extraordinarily compelling and full of thrills. After winning the heavyweight championship Adonis Creed is challenged by Viktor Drago, the son of the man who killed his father in the ring, and Adonis accepts, seeing a chance to right the past. Michael B. Jordan is excellent, giving perhaps his best performance yet, and Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren are also really good. And, the script does an impressive job at creating engaging character arcs and the fight scenes are incredibly intense and exciting. Creed II is a definite KO that ranks among the best in the franchise.",8,2,2,9 November 2019
Blade Runner," Best science fiction movie ever made !
","This iconic, seminal masterpiece still stands as a visually dazzling display of dark, visceral, and deeply philosophical sci-fi spectacle that holds its main greatness in its groundbreaking visual effects and aesthetics, Rutger Hauer's singular performance, and an unforgettable score by Vangelis.",10,1,2,22 October 2019
Amélie," This movie always brings me joy. I love it.
","One of my favourite movies, I could watch it on repeat. The story is well paced, the director does an amazing job executing the film, wonderful music. This movie is unique and strange but at the same time it's your typical rom-com movie. If you haven't watched it you definitely should.",10,1,3,23 October 2019
The Sixth Sense," A delicate, emotionally attentive, but very scary ghost story.
","Shyamalan's debut film as well as his best (in my opinion). The Sixth Sense is a well crafted movie with excellent performances, chilling moments and a well written story. Check out The Sixth Sense if you are a fan of horror movies or a fan of movies in general.",8,0,0,26 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An adequate return for the franchise.
",The movie recreates the nostalgia of the first original movies in the story wars saga while also creating a new set of characters. The movie has some spectacular visuals then I felt it could easily be compared to a new hope. Overall though the film was pleasurable and is a must see for the general audience.,7,1,9,25 October 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The epic conclusion to a great trilogy.
","An epic, emotional, and jaw-droppingly beautiful conclusion to the best film trilogy of all time, The Return of the King ends the epic trilogy on a high note and is exactly how this film should have been. From Andy Serkis's brilliant performance as Gollum to the epic battle at the gates of Mordor, Return of the King is epic, period.",10,0,0,22 October 2019
The Truman Show," It's undoubtedly one of my favorite movies, the kind of movie that changes our lives, as well as looking like a long episode of Black Mirror.
","As inventive and creative as Weir's staging is, The Truman Show wouldn't work without credible Truman. And Carrey carries off the tricky role with a chipperness that belies a deep-seeded longing for more in life than surface perfection in all this movie is one of my all time favorites.",9,6,6,25 October 2019
The Matrix," A great movie that makes you wanna question reality.
","Simply a masterpiece. The Watchowskis brothers would forever change cinema with this movie. For many, it was the first movie to transcend the big screen, to become the subject of endless discussions in bars and gatherings. The action does not outshine all the other layers in the movie, like societal reflection, philosofy and self-preservation.",10,0,0,22 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that started 'it all.'
","An important and revolutionary film. Unforgettable, fun and smart. If you haven't seen this film yet or any other Star Wars film for that matter, then you are doing a complete disservice!",9,1,1,25 October 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The material is superb, Neil Innes' music is tremendous and Gilliam's animations are timelessly brilliant.
","A charming and hilarious cult, The Holy Grail is certally one of the most funniest films that I ever saw. This first full length by the british group Monty Python, it's a unique odyssey by the medieval time with surrealist humor and remarkable characters, scenes and lines. In the edge from absurd and silliness, Monty Python and The Holy Grail gonna make the audience laugh from the opening titles until the last scene.",10,1,1,22 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," By far the best of the Star Wars saga.
","Proof that if George Lucas wants his intellectual property to grow and flourish, he should lay the ground work and then take a step back and let it develop on its own. This is evident in the leap in story depth and character development from A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back. Maybe he should have let someone else take over screenplay writing and directing after Phantom Menace. This film really does get deeper into the characters and is definitely the best film in the first trilogy. Sets are extraordinary and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian (aka the only black guy in George Lucas's universe) was excellent. They ended the film in a perfect place making the audience crave to know what happens next. The film gives us a chance to grow even more with the characters from A New Hope and has a massive reveal toward the end (at least to those that saw it in the 80s).",10,0,0,25 October 2019
Gangs of New York," Another great by Scorsese. Daniel Day Lewis does a fantastic job as usual.
",One of the last truly great historical epics I can think of boosted by one of the all time anti hero performances by Lewis and a solid badass role by Leo. While not the most historically accurate film it does the period justice and gave them the epic they deserved.,8,4,4,22 October 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," One of the greatest action films of all time.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that I truly enjoyed watching. The entire film was well constructed from top to bottom. While touching on the pressing topic of our world as we know it turning into a desert where water is a high commodity, the film has a lot of heart without verbally saying much. The acting from Theron, Hardy, and Hoult was deep. This film is very visual. From the cinematography, color grading, production design, special effects, and costuming, the film creates this amazing world filled with gold, red, and bright turquoise. It is an interesting combination of skull laden violence from the vehicles and warriors paired with the vast ethereal landscapes and white-clothed females. The combination works as these elements often go hand in hand. I enjoyed the cinematography in the film because it was very dynamic, and the edit worked great with the shots and furthering the story. Although there was minimal dialogue in the film, the soundscape and accompanying score took me into the world of the film. I enjoyed seeing the rock elements incorporated throughout the film.",9,3,4,25 October 2019
Gladiator," Amazingly powerful movie from start to finish.
","As far as film making goes, you probably can't top this. The practical effects are amazing, the stunts are amazing and just the overall astatic is even better. Hans Zimmer also provides what is in my opinion one of his best ever scores, which just make the fight scenes even more entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix also gives what is probably his best performance ever, and definitely deserved an Oscar for it. Russell Crowe, although great in the movie, seems to have play his character on one note, making it a mystery how he got one and Joaquin didn't. Another issue is that although it's entertaining, all the enjoyment is on the surface, so it's not the sort of movie you'll be thinking about a lot afterwards. Still a great classic.",10,2,3,24 October 2019
The Pursuit of Happyness," An inspiring and heartwarming film.
","Melodramatic, sad, heartfelt movie about a man never giving up and finding true happiness in life. The movie has that message of 'life's hard' or 'life's unfair', which is true, but how do get through it?. In all seriousness, Will Smith and Jaden Smith will break your heart and rebuild them again, they both give powerful performances and have insanely good chemistry (obviously sense in real life they are father and son). The story is incredible, the acting is superb, the emotion never stops being powerful.",9,0,0,25 October 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," What we want from Spielberg and Lucas is plenty of action, and plenty of laughs. And that's just what they deliver.
","Before even the days of 'Raiders Of The Ark', Spielberg had expressed an interest in making a James Bond movie but he couldn't get the go-ahead from Bond producer Albert 'Cubby' Broccoli. Indy was just as good an opportunity for him, though, and who better to cast as Indy's father than (the original) James Bond himself? It's actually through the casting choice of Sean Connery that this third instalment of Indy's adventures really takes flight and silences the critics of 'The Temple Of Doom'. In his third outing, Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) goes in search of his father, Prof. Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who mysteriously disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Once again, though, the Nazi's are also in tow. After losing on the Ark of the Covenant, they too want to get their hands on the Cup of Christ. By the time of this films release everybody was fully aware of Indiana Jones. With only two films under his fedora, every woman wanted him and every man wanted to be him; Indy had already become an icon of American cinema. With a fond familiarity, people welcomed him into their homes and that's the very reason why the opening of this third instalment is such a joy. It's depiction of Indy in his youth is wonderful addition to his backstory and the late great River Phoenix does an excellent job in capturing Ford's mannerisms. We learn of his use of the whip and the resulting scar on his chin. We also get an insight into the procurement of his famous fedora and how his unusual name of 'Indiana' originated from the family dog... (It was actually George Lucas' dog that was named Indiana and it also served as the inspiration for Chewbacca in 'Star Wars'). After being heavily criticised for his dark tone in 'Temple of Doom', Spielberg finds his lighter side again and delivers the funniest and most gleefully entertaining of Indy's adventures. The likes of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies return from Raiders with more fleshed out comical roles but, as mentioned, it's the great interplay between Ford and Connery that's the biggest draw to here. The chemistry between them anchors a poignant family adventure while providing numerous father/son comedic moments. Like the previous two, though, there's no shortest of nail-biting action as World War II is on the brink and the Nazi's are once again Indy's foes and gives Spielberg another chance to put the Third Reich to the test. 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' are obviously his more personal films on the subject but with Indy he gets the chance to have fun with them again, leaving this third instalment with more in common with 'Raiders' as well as honing in on the biblical aspects of the story. Out goes the Ark and in comes the coveted Holy Grail and while the fourth film in the franchise - 'The Kingdom Of The Crystal' - explores a misjudged science-fiction element, it confirms that Indy's adventures are better left in the paths of the religious or the occult.",10,2,3,2 February 2020
The Great Gatsby," A bit flashier than the novel but it's closest adaptation.
","The Great Gatsby is a thrilling movie, I love how it combines older music with modern movie. The acting in the film is spot on. It also hits soo on for what the times would've been like back then. The movie wasn't afraid to also show how times were different with race and how men thought they were above women. Some people may think that took it to far, but that's how the times were. The dancing was also spot on with the Jazz era. If you haven't watched it recently you need to. Look at it with both eyes open this time.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
Princess Mononoke," Epic is the purest word to describe this movie !
","First Studio Ghibli movie to mix hand-drawn and CG-animation, resulting in a piece of art and the greatest Studio Ghibli film ever created. A masterwork with compelling characters, a fascinating story and a great message to be learned. Hayao Miyazaki's best film still manages to put many modern anime movies to shame with its amazing visuals, action packed scenes and wonderful soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi. Mononoke Hime avoids the classic black or white morality issue and deals with more powerful themes than other Ghibli movies, turning this film from something that could've easily been a children's book into a fantastic tale for people of all ages. This is, in my opinion, the best anime film of all time.",10,1,1,23 October 2019
The Martian," The interplanetary tech geek gardening thriller of the year.
","The Martian plays to both Scott's strengths and weaknesses. By relegating Mark's predicament to a purely survivalist scenario, he keeps things humming along without ever widening the horizon. But there was an obligation to widen the horizon.",9,1,2,26 October 2019
V for Vendetta," One of the best comic book adaptations of all time.
","As for movies which put politics into their movies, this one rocks. It diverges from the comics, but the story line is coherent and Hugo Weaving's performance is excellent. Awesome movie.",8,2,2,26 October 2019
