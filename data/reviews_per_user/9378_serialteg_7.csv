The Hangover," Yes, I rate this a 10!
","Absolute coolness! Great movie, a must-own comedy. The way the story's told and portrayed is excellent. I'm trying to find a fault, but the movie is pretty well balanced. Doesn't bail out on the ending either (Year One), this one follows thru right to the end. Has to be there at the top of my top movies ever, and that's a nuff said! I believe a strong indicator of a movie's success in popular culture is if people clap at the ending. Last time I saw it happen was with Wanted, and this movie is much stronger than Wanted in my opinion. This movie ended, people just clapped. And that's great! Now I'm not saying this is foolproof - I liked The Mist ending, and people in the movies hated it - but yeah, you get the drift. If not, open the windows! Bombo clat!",10,8,14,12 July 2009
Star Trek," W00t!
","It's good when you can share something with the rest of the flock. It seems that the goods outweigh the bads in this one. Fast paced, action packed, great visuals, kind of a not-complex story in the main problem as compared to, let's say, Star Trek: Generations where they tackle time travel and lots of sci-fi goodies I love. Nevertheless, this one rocks. It's on par with the best movies I've seen in 2009, up there with Horsemen.I believe movies nowadays are meant to be watched on pitch-black plasmas with Blu-Ray and a good hi-fi sound system. Cinemas, at least Puerto Rican basic projection-style 35mm cinemas, just don't cut it. I love the big screen, and a load of popcorn, Coca Colas, and the occasional sneaking of a Butterfinger or a Burger King combo into the movies, but I'm aching for a good flat screen set and some nice blu-ray action!",9,1,7,7 July 2009
The Maze Runner," It wasn't that bad
","So I've read a lot of people dissing the movie, and I don't find it that bad. Maybe the book was better. Boy, doesn't that happen enough? The cinematography is good, the effects are good, the clich√©s are there. But if I leave it at that, you'd think 'why did this guy give it 8/10'? Well, because I was entertained, I was left wondering, it could've been better like 99.9% of all movies ever made, but it also could've been a LOT WORSE.I studied - majored - in Cinematography, and I can appreciate the hard work that goes into a movie. Even if it's a bad movie. I stand and leave theaters when it goes bad, and I wouldn't have done it here. See the movie, draw your own conclusions (about the ladder: do you think the grievers wouldn't climb up?), and it looks like a book reading is in order.",8,72,103,29 November 2014
Public Enemies," Left the theaters!
","I say it's awful, and with no inhibitions whatsoever. I left the theater about more than a halfway thru. Flat, I don't know if it was the projection or what but it looked like there were some errors in the film, in the actual video, it just seemed like this movie was put out without careful screening or whatnot. It was such a disappointment. The trailers had me pumped, like, this could be another Heat! The only heat I felt ... wait, I felt none.Not even gonna recommend it as a download / rent. Save your money for something useful. They keep requiring me to write long - I said what I came here to say already!",1,3,12,7 July 2009
Watchmen," Good!
","Frankly, the movie's too long for my taste, but the cinematography is very good. If it was a little tighter I would've put it higher than Dark Knight, only because I almost (or did?) fall asleep watching that, and here I had to take frequent breaks. It's not bad when a movie's long, necessarily; I guess I'm just too used to the around-120-minutes formula. I liked the new Star Trek better, I guess that's how I can kind of put it. The storyline here is a little more engrossing, given the fact that it points out the good and the bad dichotomy in a way I think is very well portrayed, especially in the latter parts of the movie. All in all, if it's one thing I've learned about art, is that you have to see it for yourself in order to judge it.",8,0,2,7 July 2009
Knowing," Sci-Ligion!
","I give it a solid 8. Better than I expected. Good, solid fun, I wish there was more to the ending - let's say I wanted it to happen before so we could get to the sci-fi MEAT, and those who know me, know I'm all about that. But hey.The pre-ending gave me tears, but the end-end had me going oh, no they didn't. But they did. Kind of wished they hadn't stepped on that. But that's just the atheist in me talking, and I guess this movie ended up bridging sci-ligion. For this reason I evoked the Spoiler Alert. Kind of never want to spoil the movie, but you know. If you watched it, be my guest to discuss it with me. If not, go watch it.",8,1,3,7 July 2009
Midsommar," I see this is a love / hate movie
","I liked it. Reading up on comments by date reviewed (impartial), looks like more hate than love. This is my total up the alley movie especially with horror. Will watch director's other movie and keep an eye out on his next. Loved the use of video effects on hallucinogens, never taken shrooms but tripped out on subtlety.",8,1,3,28 September 2019
