Source Code," Hard SF or Thriller?
","I have watched this movie now because I'm scheduling a thematic channel.Does science have no feelings? Love conquers all?Jake Gyllenhaal is in his best. And... what can I say... I love Michelle (her welsh surname too).I love films where reality is not what it seems. And it seems a fast paced thriller but I think that this falls under the genre of Hard Science-Fiction. The best is that it forces you to think, as Interestellar.The only 'But...' is that certain times of the script are slaughtered to the thriller tension. However the end result is powerful and moving. Highly recommended.",7,2,3,15 September 2015
Army of Darkness," A classic, surprisingly
","I've watched this movie now because I'm scheduling a thematic channel.Bruce Campbell is the best. Why he has not appeared on screen more often? Army of Darkness is a joke, but over time has become a classic. Ash is a real anti hero in movie history, after this adventure and Evil Dead's. And I love the mention of the Necronomicon, the central book of the Lovecraft universe (When a good movie about it?).Sam Raimi had fun with the Harryhausen style skeletons and the Robin Hood sword battles. He made several milestones of a new genre: horror comedy. Thanks.The only 'But...' is the advertising to the NRA.",6,0,2,16 September 2015
