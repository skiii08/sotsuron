Hereditary," DON'T DO ANY INVESTIGATING
","I know it's hard in this day and age not to want to find out ever little secret and spoiler of a movie before you see it- but I went into this film pretty much blind, other than watching the trailer- and it was a good move. I was SO shocked at points, all because I didn't do any research and the trailer is literally just a SNIPPET of the full story- seriously, if you think you know the story off of the trailer, plot twist, you seriously don't.
I think what's great about this film is that it left me with questions, with intrigue and with genuine engagement- I just want to see it again so badly, and I only saw it last night! 
It is 100% scary, at some points terrifying. However I'd say it's more shocking and disturbing that 'terrifying'- however the INCREDIBLE score really makes it hard for this film not to get under your skin, honestly the music in this movie is a 10/10 followed also by the cinematography. Most importantly however, the acting is superb- I was really impressed by Alex Wolff and Toni Collette especially, I think she truly deserves an Oscar nom' for this role. 
Overall a very horrifying film, one that actually made me feel slightly sick for a few minuets afterwards, it was also an incredibly gripping film to watch. So yea, go watch it!",10,25,51,16 June 2018
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback has done something to me, exquisitely heartbreaking!
","It has been less than 24 hours since I've watched this movie... I am about to watch it again after i write this review. Like many others, I felt obliged to commend Ang Lee, the late Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and everyone else involved in this wonderful film. A true modern day classic.First and foremost, I decided to watch this movie because I heard about a steamy scene between the two leads Ledger and Gyllenhaal, which in itself was amazingly executed- but i had no idea what i was in for with the movie. Which was why I'm even more upset and hypnotized by this film. Don't do too much research, go in blind.Ledger and Gyllenhaal are exceptional and have the most amazing on screen chemistry (especially considering they were both heterosexual- to the best of my knowledge) The relationship Jack Twist, upbeat rodeo boy and Ennis Del Mar, glum ranch guy have is spellbinding. The looks they give each other, the subtle touches and their constant longing for each other makes this EVEN MORE heartbreaking! I won't spoil anything for you but be warned- you will feel deeply affected by this movie, i know i have been- In a beautiful way!Today, i have felt slightly empty. Feeling lost with out Brokeback Mountain and all it ensues. It is truly the best movie i have ever watched and i have seen many a film. I need to watch it again because i feel i need closure otherwise this film will haunt me forever. I have told all my friends about this film, and felt i needed to tell you too! I can't stop thinking about this film, and everything that went on. It covers 20 years of life, love and mountain trips that are truly delightful. Delightful.If you make the brilliant decision of watching this film, you are in for a roller-coaster of humour, heartbreak and passion like no other film. I could NOT recommend this film any more if i tried. WATCH BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, YOU'RE MISSING OUT IF YOU HAVE'NT!!!",10,5,6,2 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," With regards to the use of red in this film
","Colour symbolism in movies is something that I appreciate very much, whilst also realising it's something that can be overdone.I've awarded this film ten stars for many reasons, one of the primary reasons being how the colour red is used in this film. Spectacular. My mother didn't notice red played such a huge role, but that's when you know it's being done right. The use of red really reminds you throughout of the anger Mildred constantly feels the whole run time. With red finishes on her shop, a red sweater worn my Mildred on several occasions and flashes of red light throughout you're forced to deal with Mildred's inner emotions spilling out into the physical world. You're trapped in the anger of it all.Also huge HUGE credits to McDonagh for not shying away from the violence and language presented in this movie. It just makes everything feel less Hollywood and real. Why wouldn't you swear every other minuet after your daughter was raped and killed? Some scenes are so shocking and then completely downplayed by the next scene. It's incredible.Excellent film with no resolution, because in the real world, how many people actually find a resolution to crimes like rape and murder?",10,1,3,9 December 2018
Bird Box," Dull... but I watched to the end for some reason!!!
","Bullock was great but the story was just a bit dull. Felt very been there done that.... but with the added unbelievability that people can navigate forests completely blind without smashing their noses in on tree trunks or swim in rapids and not freeze to death or find their 5 year old kids after.
Ah, the realism.",5,0,1,31 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," What a wonderful film
","Just finished watching Azkaban for the first time in years (I'm 18, I think I watched Akzaban for the first time when I was about 12). I'm really surprised by how in-depth and detailed this movie is, considering how I thought that only the third film into the series, it would still be quite childish. However, I was proved wrong and left enchanted by a beautifully rich set design and intricate plot- one that in the final act, had me gobsmacked by how interesting and UNIQUE it was!Watching this film, sometimes you forget that it's one of the largest film franchises on Earth. Usually, with these big films, there's never any attention payed to how the film looks; it's all about big explosions and SFX. However, with Azkaban (and hopefully the rest of the series, that I'm going to binge after this review), the cinematography is STUNNING. The whole film is engrossed in such a mesmerising, fresh and vibrant British countryside, along with incredible architecture. I'm a sucker for gorgeous British settings in films, with 2005 Pride & Prejudice's own setting helping to make that movie one of my all time favourites, Azkaban has the same beauty that immediately pulls me into the film.Great plot, brilliant acting, especially from Rickman and Thewlis.9/10",9,1,1,24 September 2019
The Favourite," Not what I was expecting but I'm honestly not quite sure what I was expecting.
","That's about all I have to say on the matter.
The acting and cinematography is superb, I also loved the first 30 minuets. I'm just not entirely sure about how I feel towards the latter half of the film.
It felt like a slight farce. Beautiful film though.
The Lobster is one you should check out also.",7,3,4,27 February 2019
Pride & Prejudice," Possibly the only film that I have seen 3 times and loved it even more with each viewing
","There's something just so sumptuously gorgeous about this film. The vivid greens and warm yellow sunlight never fails to completely enchant me, coupled with Knightley's effervescent performance, it's just so close to perfection.I am a stickler for an English film, perhaps even more so for a period English film, so Pride and Prejudice just gets me every time. The settings always amaze me and the director has done a sublime job at really engrossing you into the scenes.For a film with such a steady pace, Pride and Prejudice never feels boring. Never too slow or monotonous. It feels as if you're part of this dreamy world, gliding through with the characters, who all contribute to the general feel in their own unique ways. Knightley is just great, it is wonderful to see her character's relationship grow and flower with Mr. Darcy.The score is also just impeccable. The title piano track really fills me with such a warmth every time.I just adore this film and find that it gets better with every viewing. It is surely one for the ages.",10,0,0,9 May 2019
Mother!," An intense and brilliant spectacle for thinkers.
","This is not your run of the mill thriller/horror/ANY genre movie, no, Mother! is a film of great complexity and depth. So deep in fact that I'm still trying to work it out completely whilst writing this review. I can see why it's not had the best response as it's not a film for the placid or close-minded, quite the contrary actually.My take is that Aronofsky has tried and succeeded to depict: <ul><li>Human development in a world not intended for them - How religion affects people - The dangers of religion and cults - A huge allegory for life itself and the way the Earth responds to our actions as a race. </li></ul>It is not as simple as many people would like, these are the people who enjoy speedy car chases and shallow love stories- but hey, we're all different!Overall Mother! is my favourite film of the year, without a doubt (what an awful year it's been anyway). Performances from Lawrence and Bardem were really brilliant and believable with others from Pfeiffer stealing the show. A great film, which still messes with my head and will continue to do so.",10,1,6,24 October 2017
Alien: Covenant," Don't listen to the hate- Alien: Covenant is entertaining. Period.
","I've read all of these heated 1 star reviews and I am quite frankly shocked by these people's over-complicated and cynical reviews. Alien: Covenant left me feeling thoroughly satisfied and intrigued by the end.The movie throws you into the chaos pretty quickly into the run time- about 10 minuets after it starts. This is great. A movie which actually starts as it means to go on. How refreshing. What follows, with everyone landing on the planet was so brilliantly filmed with some very ominous music- you just know this is going to be a crazy ride. Lets not forget, movies are there for the purpose of entertainment. You will be entertained by this film. The violence was brilliant and of course not as shocking as the original Alien's violence, but then again, it never will be. However, I was very pleased that Scott didn't back away from showing all of the guts and gore- this film has PLENTY! Some almighty scenes which give the original Alien movie a run for its money (cough *Back buster* cough) I just hope you don't take all of these teary and one-sided reviews too seriously. Don't over-complicate this movie. Enjoy it for all it's twists and turns and appreciate them as the movie unfolds. It is a really great film which compelled me to write a review so someone out there will watch this movie and appreciate it's brilliance too!",10,7,22,29 May 2017
