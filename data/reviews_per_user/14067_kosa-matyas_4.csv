The Lobster," Wes Anderson style spiced with awe inspiring thriller
","Don't misunderstand me, this film cant'be judged of ripping of Wes Anderson's directorial style. I haven't seen any other film from Yorgos Lanthimos so i can't evaluate his director's oeuvre. However I can state that this film was absolutely worth watching. Wonderful elements, exciting plot, the cast was very proper and British which I think it made the film more special.The director's work was immaculate. Those refined British humor was indispensable. With its upsetting story and shocking scenes, with its weird and pathetic dialogs this film is a unique one. A must see, a classic one. The final scene ends with a food for thought, which questioning the reality, the entity of the love and argue the boundaries of the love itself. Utterly splendid piece.",8,3,8,15 February 2016
Everest," More should have been brought out of it
","Run-of-the-mill, definitely an average film. The soundtrack was utterly boring, Baltasar Korm√°kur could have utilized the script much more. Eventually it is a drama, terrible tragedies happened to the climbers.The moment when they reached the summit of the everest in my opinion was too weak emotionally, not any dramatic catharsis nor emotive upheaval. I really missed these feelings. The memorable events and turning points was primitive and did not bring forth deep sentiment. For example when Scott Fischer died, not any portentous moment which caught me. The dead came and Fischer accepted it and fell into sleep, end of story. Naturally in case of Rob Hall(when he was dying) it was grandiose because Keira Knightley's acting was enthralling in that scene. Summarizing: Could have been a classic film if Terrence Malick would have directed it.",6,4,5,6 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," There is nothing new under the sun
","-SPOILER ALERT-When I sat down in the fourth line of the movie theater I have got goosebumps as I was 12 years old when I first saw Episode II - Attack of the Clones in the cinema. When I saw the opening credits (in The Force Awakens) I noticed it was too simple and plain.. realized nothing epic can come out of it( of course there will be two more parts). I understand JJ Abrahams, that he want this film a classic one like the New Hope, with few sword-fights, with little characters and more emphasis on the two main characters. As I see their personalities became not as unfolded, unwrapped at the end of the film as i expected. Like i see Finn's personality can be a bit funny, little coward but when its about Rey his action showed him as a brave one. These traits can have a ludicrous impact on his character and the audience could take him as a funny guy at the expense of the dramatic quality of the film.(some terrible joke about whether Rey has a boyfriend was pathetic, and the Disney feeling was perceptible in the events when they escape from the monsters, or troops can perceive as a weak adventure film) At the contrary Rey has a strong character: dedicated, brave, susceptible, well-balanced(we can see already she will never convert to the dark side) and as we can see she can almost defeat Kylo Ren, a member of the Knights of Ren without any training. In my opinion it is ridiculous. So she is better than Anakin( or as my father used to call him'Anatan') because she is not emotionally unbalanced like Anakin, and can fight really good without any training (okay, must have really hight midi-chlorian) JJ Abrahams wants this girl as a perfect one. I don't know the stunt doubles need to make a really good job to make Reys actions, fights enjoyable. Reys personality traits are too masculine and I think women cannot identify themselves with her( of course it's a fantasy anything can be possible) because that's not how a woman fight and strive. If Rey will be the only Jedi, it will surely be dissatisfactory. Lets be hones , most fan of the Star Wars are mainly male, and they eagerly wait for the real deal: a potent knight who will be so powerful and undefeatable at the end. Good wars, fights, duels will be awaited, and it waits mostly for Rey to fulfill that wish. I am curious. JJ Abrahmas truly made a great leap into what....",7,3,13,19 December 2015
The Breakfast Club," Excellent piece - perennial classic
","Youngs are just want to be loved and understood, nothing changed since 30 years ago, in 2016 the film has the same eternal meaning. The film perfectly shows the difference, the gap between the generations and the problems of the young people in their families.John Bender's living in a dysfunctional family with a drunkard aggressive father, we can see that he is a traumatized youngster after he opened himself and told the others about his life at home where he doesn't get much love and tenderness. Andrew Clark and Brian Johnsons life is a disaster because their parents put too much burden on them, which they cannot bear. Claire Standish the spoiled prom queen seems the least overburdened between the others. Allison Reynolds the basket case definitely became ridden because her parents ignore her thats why she needs therapy.Firs when we observe them we see just normal students who got into detention because they deserved it, at least we could draw the conclusion. After we got acquainted with their feelings, their actions and they said why they did those actions we came into the consequence they just suffer from lack of love, need each other to provide support and bolster their emotions. John Bender the criminal and the teacher Richard Vernons case is typically a bad example how bad teachers are ruining the education in the schools and corrupting the integrity of the problematic pupils. The Breakfast Club shows how adamant and strong the children can be and sometimes maybe they are so intransigent because their minds know what they do. These children cannot be vanquished, they can hold each other's back and can survive this life.",9,0,1,14 March 2016
