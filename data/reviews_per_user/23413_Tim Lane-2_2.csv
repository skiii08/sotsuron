Raiders of the Lost Ark," Snakes, why did it have to be snakes?
","The definitive adventure film. Its Over the top and plays almost like a comic book or a hardy boys book at times. It has the right mix of puzzles and intrigue with Action, car chases, shoot outs and fun. There are deaths and dead bodies in the film but even these are so theatrical that they aren't shocking or disturbing. It makes you jump, it makes you laugh. I like films where you don't have to concentrate too hard, where you can sit back and enjoy the adventure. Every little boys fantasy on screen. The characters are almost caricatures, Indy, with the hat and the bull whip, Marion beats any 'Bond girl' hands down and the Nazi wears a knee length Black leather jacket and sinister black gloves and little glasses even in the desert. I loved it. All three Jones films are good but this is where it all started.",Null,0,0,14 March 2000
The Patriot," racist, innacurate, offensive.
","This file has something for everyone except the bloody British, what's Mel Gibson's problem with us anyway? I've seen a lot of Hollywood people say that the British are the only race left they can use as bad guys without offending. This is wrong; we are offended, especially when the film is as historically inaccurate and downright racist as this one. The Brits were nowhere near as immoral as this film makes out in the war of independence. I would love to see a film that has all the adventure and everything of Braveheart or Patriot but is accurate. The problem is that the majority of moviegoers aren't going to know any better and will believe that this is real history",Null,0,1,24 August 2000
