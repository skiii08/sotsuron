The Blair Witch Project," Emperor's new broomstick
","If a beginning film class at a community college were given the task of adapting a Stephen King short story on video, the results would probably look much like this bewilderingly untalented feature, which is on its way to being the most popular independent film of all time. The two novice directors claim not to have seen Ruggero Deodato's extremely similar (and infinitely superior) CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, though the debt RESERVOIR DOGS pays to Ringo Lam's CITY ON FIRE is chump change in comparison. A snooty-toot documentary filmmaker schleps two guys into the woods of Maryland to record evidence of a fabled serial-killing witch. The two guys fill up the first thirty minutes of the movie with fart-sniffing jokes; then, when you're waiting for something terrifying to be unearthed, the crew is menaced with--a bundle of twigs? A pile of stones? A tooth? The B horror movies of Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur were low on horror and high on atmospherics. Here, in the absence of palpable shocks, you get--twigs. The oafish storytelling, the 'documentary' surface that wouldn't fool a child in short pants, acting that evokes the adult-entertainment industry--somehow this all spun the buzz machine and turned BLAIR WITCH into the flavor of the nanosecond. Depressingly, a friend called tonight from Houston, Texas, to report that lines curled around two city blocks. This hunk of unutterable junk feels like taps for the independent film movement: the message seems to be, You can be a klutz with a video camera, just as long as you're high-concept. (The directors' advice in an interview to aspiring filmmakers: 'Find a marketable niche.')",Null,0,1,20 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...George Lucas knew how to direct a movie
","Humor that would only delight the overfed children of a visiting Mittel-Europa dictator; dialogue evoking the title cards of silent movies; good guys defined by their English accents and lack of expression--everything about THE PHANTOM MENACE is a bewildering disaster. If a fusty Viennese professor and a scrofulous teenage video-game designer collaborated on a piece of Pop Art, this would be the result--a dense, clotted, mirthless affair that has none of the visual and storytelling clarity of the first movie, and none of the cheesy cliffhanging appeal of the other two.This rambling, plotless expenditure of vast sums of money is about as impossible to criticize rationally as a Burger King cup or a bath towel. In its favor, it can be said that in the chariot race Lucas has devised one of movies' all-time most viscerally enthralling set pieces--but enthralling only as a video game, not a movie, is. Scenes end with Lucas' beloved old-school wipe of the screen, and you feel the audience saying, 'That was a scene?' As the Jedi knights, Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor look as if they must have fallen into each other's arms laughing at the end of each take. (Neeson's attempts to commit fully to Lucas' unmouthable hooey is the one poignant thing in the movie.)",Null,0,1,26 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Sedition and construction-paper puke
","In its abhorrence of moms, the Army, appropriate viewing material, Bill Clinton's legacy-polishing through NATO bombing, Alan Menken scores, and finally itself, SOUTH PARK ranks among NATURAL BORN KILLERS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE in the annals of studio movies that atomize every item of mainstream culture and dearly-held values that pass in their wake. Unfortunately, it doesn't equal those movies in acuity, skill, or even laughs. It's a ninety-minute movie in which construction-paper stick figures call each other testicle-biters. That the filmmakers manage to hold our interest with that material on a giant screen for an hour and a half is a heroic achievement; but the pre-release hype outpaces the movie--at least in the yuks department.The movie suggests that Stone and Parker may be smart guys who could actually graduate from the poo-poo world; it also suggests that might not really believe all this scandalous stuff, any more than Howard Stern does when he pulls off a gross stunt to maintain his 'outrageous' quotient. (You can sense him wanting to discuss politics, or talk to Albert Brooks.) The test of the movie's effectiveness for me, though, is that it really makes you angry at its satirical targets. It has an invigorating I'm-gonna-say-whatever-I-want-and-you-can't-stop-me quality--you wouldn't think anyone could work you up into a lather over nosy parents and Winona Ryder.SOUTH PARK is a badly needed corrective to the protect-our-precious-children smarm that arose in the wake of the Littleton shooting--it's the only voice that has emerged in popular culture to say what's needed. It says the unspeakable--that all this protectiveness really isn't about the kids in question at all, but about parents' images of themselves. The weird thing about the picture is that it really is a movie of ideas--you come out wondering about Stone and Parker's politics more than you remember laugh lines. And the scenes in Hell, involving some poignant gay sex between Satan and Saddam Hussein, are more deliriously surreal than anything ever seen with a Warner Brothers label. But for all that, the Disney song parodies are endless, repetitive and endlessly repetitive; and Stone and Parker have more funny ideas than funny jokes. But they once seemed like a couple of obnoxious, gen-x frat boys in the manner of Kevin Smith. They ain't no more. If they put on a button-down shirt and get away from the scissors and rubber cement, they might grow into a millennial version of George Axelrod.",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's best movie
","At the time of its release, Tim Burton's ED WOOD seemed a slight but sweet-spirited charmer; a few years later, it seems like an almost-great movie, a sincere song of love to a giftless Pollyanna's love for filmmaking. Burton cast perfectly down to the tiniest bits, and Peter Suschitzky's steely black-and-white photograph puts the movie's images in the league of RAGING BULL and THE ELEPHANT MAN. Burton seems somehow more deeply connected to this material than anything in his other pictures--in his kitschy way, he has as sure a touch with this story and its milieu as Coppola had with the Corleones.",Null,0,0,28 March 1999
American Pie," Porky's Complaint
","Some wonk at Universal woke up one Monday last August, went to his desk, picked up the phone and said, 'Gimme SOMETHING ABOUT MARY for sixteen-year-olds'--and now we have this wedge of comic raunch, a schizoid vacillation between the WB-sweet and the Farrelly Brothers salty. It's a very bad and quizzically likable movie--endearing mostly for its talented cast, a group of game, fizzy youths you wish you were watching in something else. The movie lacks the guts of my favorite eighties horny-teen movie, Boaz Davidson's coarse and then strangely lachrymose LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN (1982), but even the cloying stuff feels heartfelt.  The best performances: Eddie Kaye Thomas as a pint-sized version of Aaron Eckhart in a Neil LaBute movie; Chris Klein, reprising his saintly jock from ELECTION; and Natasha Lyonne, reprising her mouthy malcontent from SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS.",Null,0,0,9 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Unearned
","Spielberg does to Kurosawa and Welles what Mark McGwire did to Roger Marris in the magnificently staged battle scenes that bookend this D-Day melodrama. His beach-storming opening pushes the how-much-can-you-stand? envelope about twenty feet farther than even the most daring moments in SCHINDLER'S LIST; he seems to have an unerring sixth sense for the audience's breaking point. And the climax--a cat-and-mouse game between the spottily armed American platoon and a series of tank-bound Germans--suggests a set piece from THE GREAT ESCAPE with nineties technology and Spielbergian horse sense.It was Spielberg's derring-do that made this movie a monster hit--not the star presence of Tom Hanks as the saver and Matt Damon as the saved. And it certainly wasn't the script, which affords Spielberg a few opportunities for nicely offhand, verite-ish, lived-in scenes, but consists mostly of Tom Hanks staring at a distant cloud and delivering the most sentimental 'unsentimental' bromides in a war movie ever. Hanks is supposed to be a scruffier, more cynical and wised-up version of the Henry Fonda Good American. His monologues of common, simple decency have the numbing monotony of a centrist Democrat Senator dedicating a new high school. Hanks morphing into a latter-day Jimmy Stewart is dismal enough; the speechifying by members of his platoon, especially the unendurable Ed Burns commemorating his girl-back-home's mammoth breasts, take the movie to flatline status. (The script was uncreditedly rewritten by Frank Darabont, of the poor-man's-Spielberg SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.)",Null,0,0,15 May 1999
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Nadir
","One comes away from Pasolini's adaptation of Sade's 120 DAYS OF SODOM with a handful of impressions: stately silence; horrors shot with an implacability that's painfully deliberate; sly asides about the hand-in-glove relationship of fascism to modernism; and an ending that, as Saint John Waters has noted, is almost sentimentally moving.Is SALO a highbrow vivisection of the psychosexual dynamics of fascism, or Pasolini's home-brewed brand of snuff porn? I go with the former, though there are plenty of clues leading to the latter. In Pasolini's adaptation, a platoon of fascist aristocrats--updated from Sade's pre-fascist aristocrats--hijacks a group of peasant youths for a long weekend of humiliation, rape, and, finally, murder. Pasolini keeps things cool and dry where Sade makes them wet and frenetic; the astringency works--it puts the ideas in the foreground. And the guilt by association ascribed audiovisually to Ezra Pound and Ferdinand Leger is priceless.",Null,5,8,25 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Wild Orchid 2 with soaring aspirations
","The last and least of Kubrick's twelve extant features, EYES WIDE SHUT suggests a wistful postscript to the theme that dominated the director's career: the turning of men into machines. In EYES, the machinelike master director yearns to be a man--to make a non-misogynistic, non-misanthropic movie that sits at eye level with its characters, viewing them with empathy rather than lordly detachment. That the attempt is a sad botch stems first from Kubrick's choice of scenarist. Frederic Raphael is a witty and craftsmanlike British screenwriter who left the movie scene (more or less) after writing DARLING and TWO FOR THE ROAD. One can only speculate that Kubrick chose the sixtyish Brit to tell the story of an attractive, upwardly mobile Central Park West couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) because he wanted a brainy but controllable foot soldier to do his bidding. (Kubrick touched up Raphael's script.)Kubrick's and Raphael's incomprehension of contemporary sexual mores, the details of behavior and language that are specific to late-nineties America, gives this adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's 'Traumnovelle' a generic, uninvestigated, sketched-in feel. Unlike the phony-looking Vietnam backdrops shot in England for FULL METAL JACKET, the upscale-Manhattan ambience of EYES isn't meant to be deliberately stylized and out-of-time; it just rings phony, flat. And the flatfooted approach to scene-building that's charming in a movie like THE SHINING--where, in beginner's fashion, Kubrick opens scenes with handshakes and hellos and ends them with goodbyes--squashes whatever atmospherics Kubrick intends here. A fairly simple night-on-the-wild-side tale is molasses'd into coma by Kubrick's plodding.Visually generally undistinguished--except for a near-autistic fascination with the trippy properties of Christmas-tree lights--and clotted with dreadful bit players (Kubrick's favorite style of acting seems to be found in the featured parts in Hammer horror movies), EYES suggests a grotesquely attenuated episode of RED SHOE DIARIES. The problem is that our experience of sexuality has changed since Kubrick first announced plans for this movie, before the release of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE--but somehow the period stretching from amyl nitrate and herpes to Monica's cigar didn't reach Kubrick Manor, where the height of id-run-amok is depicted as a group of medieval-styled swingers staging a sort of Benedictine theme orgy. When the hero is meant to be chastened and shattered by his experience of Sex Untrammeled, you can only stare at the screen in bafflement. Are we really meant to think that a wealthy, good-looking doctor--surely a one-time raging frat boy--has spent his adult life in New York City and never encountered drag queens, fetish balls, subway perverts, winking hookers? Tom Cruise's performance as the regular guy undone is the best thing about the movie. His boyishness and air of unsinkability, so dull when placed in synch with a go-for-it Simpson-Bruckheimer movie, gives energy and poignancy to what would otherwise be a strictly academic exercise. Nicole Kidman is an able actress who's wrecked by Kubrick's direction--which seems to be modeled after the ticking metronome David Mamet uses to hypnotize his actors like chickens. Her giggly-airhead business in the first scenes seems to be roiling toward a boil, but then Kubrick hands her a pot-smoking big-revelation scene that seems to have been paced after the fashion of an exposition-fest in an Ed Wood movie. Blam--Kidman gets vaporised by the doomsday machine.What's touching about EYES WIDE SHUT is both that the Schnitzler material seems to have meant a lot to Kubrick, and that he had no idea what it meant. Kubrick just didn't trust himself, or didn't trust that it would be commercially sound, to give Schnitzler's ideas their proper language--free-form Expressionist poetry. Fearing becoming David Lynch, he turned himself into Adrian Lyne. Kubrick clearly took pains to make a movie that wasn't 'clinical,' sex-negative, girly-objectifying. But he also seems to have lost what he wanted the material to say. What's left is an 'erotic thriller' paced like a late Rossellini movie. It's possible that Kubrick, a valedictorian at thesis-making, didn't have the understanding of the soft insides of human beings to make this kind of movie. Or, sadder still, nearing the age of seventy, he didn't have the energy to bring it together.",Null,0,0,18 July 1999
Pulp Fiction," Most overpraised movie of the last 100,000 years
","Gen-x audiences, overstuffed by the yupped-out aesthetic of the Spielberg/John Hughes eighties, were dying for a soupcon of seventies grunge--something urban and gritty, but ironic and retro, to fit the cynical, beat-out, slackitudinous mood of the late George Bush era. That's how Quentin Tarantino served his wake-up call to the world with RESERVOIR DOGS in 1991, the alarm clock that jolted American cinema's eyes open after the long coma between BLUE VELVET and it. And PULP FICTION was the one that knocked the ball out of the park--commercially speaking. To find a cultural nerve-pinching phenomenon of similar force, you'd have to go back to BONNIE AND CLYDE or EASY RIDER. But even they didn't have the seismic, global force of this movie: it may be hard to remember a few years later, but this picture, and its author, were burned onto the public consciousness and referenced 24/7 for long, long after its release.Seen in retrospect, it's clear what put the movie over--it's like a smooth, upscale theme store stocked with gen-x fetish items (heroin! faded seventies icon! jherri curls! tongue-in-cheek machismo! Kool and the Gang! Fruit Brute!) that could make the most out-of-it yahoo feel like a hipster.What's also clear is that it's a logy, stilted, stagebound piece of work that doesn't seem to take place in any lifelike universe, even a stylized one. The only rhythm the movie can claim is that of a writer impressed with his ability to make coiled, jivy dialogue. Scenes drag on and on as Tarantino keeps on stylin'. The center section of the movie--a boxer's romance with a French honeypie and his escape from a gangster he's double-crossed--is so thoroughly leaden and spontaneity-deprived you'd think it would've been enough to sink the movie alone. But somehow the combination of the star-studded cast and the 'inside'-y, you-can-be-hip feel of the picture made it a blockbuster of the calibre usually reserved for movies about skyscrapers or planets exploding.Sadly, Tarantino, after a long, nail-biting hiatus, made his first genuinely great movie, JACKIE BROWN, which highlights all his strengths and eschews each of his flaws. All the fans who obsessed over the smallest minutiae of PULP greeted this impressive, grown-up work with a shrug and a quick retreat.",Null,1,7,20 March 1999
The Matrix," Flash
","The rebel heroes (Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss) dodge the bad guys' bullets in an office-lobby firestorm shot with the extreme telephoto lenses and druggy, sexual slow motion of the final cataclysm in ZABRISKIE POINT. (Also terribly Antonioni-ish: a slow-motion shot of a helicopter pounding a skyscraper with artillery, the dead shells tinkling to earth like collapsed wind chimes.) Scored to trance music, with the camera gliding in and around slow-motion worlds, these scenes have a peculiarly nineties artificiality--Die Hard at a Rave.But it's hard to imagine how the producer, Joel Silver (not one known for his dabbling in experiment), saw the allure of these opium-like sequences in the Wachowski Brothers' script, which contains the silliest cyber-metaphysics in contemporary movies. Poor Lawrence Fishburne--not a light touch in the best of times--is saddled with what must be the largest quantity of absurd exposition outside of an Ed Wood movie. (There are twenty minutes of the movie that feel like Lawrence Fishburne doing an industrial for Canon Copiers.) And the premise of the movie--that human beings must be rescued from this 'false' world we live in, toward the 'real,' post-apocalyptic world--doesn't make a lick of sense. (The bad guy, Joe Pantaliano, is shown to be bad because he wants to eat steak and drink wine rather than mush in a toxic desert.)The Wachowskis previously directed the unpleasantly leery lesbian-noir BOUND; what their actual personalities might be is impossible to say, as the leap from that movie to this is analogous to following up RED ROCK WEST with TRUE LIES. There are no performances to speak of in the movie, though it probably should be said that Keanu Reeves, within the postage-stamp range of this movie, seems perfectly in his element.",Null,1,2,4 April 1999
Jackie Brown," Didn't it blow your mind this time
","Quentin Tarantino finally knocks the ball out of the park. Widely seen as a 'disappointment'--or a 'raunchy doodle,' as Time's Richard Corliss put it--on the time of its release, JACKIE BROWN now looks like one of the key movies of the decade, an alternately wrenching and thrillingly lowdown work wrought out of real feeling. If a seance could summon the spirits of Jack Hill, Howard Hawks and Don Siegel, this is the picture they'd make. Amplifying all Tarantino's skills--stunningly insightful casting, indelible dialogue, a mastery of oddly static yet lustrous compositions--while shearing all his adolescent, in-joky flaws, JACKIE BROWN is like a 1973 drive-in movie that's as heartbreaking as VERTIGO. Only Tarantino would have seen the potential for trashy allure and crazy comedy in Bridget Fonda, and the performance of Robert Forster as the melancholy bailbondsman Max Cherry--simple as a Noh play, all information relayed through his impassive, age-worn face--ranks among the finest of recent times. Sadly, in 1997, only Roger Ebert and Film Comment's Kent Jones really got this one; a little while later, the near-meeting of Forster and Pam Grier seems a thousand times more harrowing than those teenagers who die on that yacht.",Null,0,0,16 February 1999
Goodfellas," Best film of the nineties
","The most joyous explosion of sheer cinema energy since CITIZEN KANE. Some may prefer the visceral emotions of RAGING BULL or the trance state of TAXI DRIVER, but this is the one where Scorsese took his place as the uncontested champion of American filmmakers. Scorsese uses his virtuosity playfully, gigglingly, like Mozart or Michael Jordan; you can practically hear him cackling, 'Can you believe what I can do?' He doesn't use his talents to bully the audience into admiration, as Spielberg sometimes does; it's like he's telling a fabulous joke he's cracking up over almost too much to complete. Of all American movies of recent decades, this is the one that stales the least with repeat viewings; you could watch it a hundred times and still feel the shiver of delight it produced on a first viewing. The perfectness of it in all regards produces a strange thrill in the audience when seeing it projected--you feel the crowd wanting to stand up and dance. With Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco; every performance is flawless, down to the tiniest bit players. Cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.
