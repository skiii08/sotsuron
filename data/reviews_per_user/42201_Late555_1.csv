Sucker Punch," Decent, but should have been so much better...
","With a group of scantily clad young ladies using swords, guns, planes, and armoured mechs to fight an array of fantasy battles against hoards of robots, orcs, dragons, nazi zombies, and the such, all tied into the old 'psychotic episode' story 'Sucker Punch' should be pressing all the right buttons. Add to that, it has slick visuals in terms of the contrasting realities and camera trickery, very good cgi effects, and a cracking soundtrack.On paper, one of the greatest things ever in the history and future of everythingness! In reality though it's rather 'meh'... :\I think the problem is you just don't really connect with any of the characters. It's made clear from the outset that most of what you're seeing probably isn't real but is instead in the main character's head (so the fantasy scenes are probably not real, but equally the reality bits probably aren't either) and I think that contributes to the feeling of not really giving a damn whether our heroes triumph or die.Certainly it's watchable, and I'd possibly even go so far as to say it's pretty decent (I remind you of all the great stuff in the first paragraph!). But it should have been soooooo much better! :(6/10",6,3,6,17 June 2011
