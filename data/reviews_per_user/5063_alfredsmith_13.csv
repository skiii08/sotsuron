The New World," Asks too much of its audience and doesn't entertain.
",Lovers of photography and beautiful images will find much to like in this film as the photography is fantastic. On a big screen it is simply magnificent. But great images on their own do not make a great movie. This film attempts to be too many things at once and fails. The 'arty' editing really turned me off. There was very little dialogue at the start of the film and I wasn't even sure what was happening. The story and plot (plot? was there a plot?) just jerked along from one scene to the next and made little sense. Colin Farrelll mumbles his way through most scenes and looks like he was acting in a different movie. I believe if there was one more lover's romp in the long grass scene I would have surely thrown up. Throughout the film the characters thoughts were audible but they often didn't relate to what was on the screen at the time.Overall a simple story dragged out to over two hours and filled out with some pretty imagery and very boring dialogue is no way to entertain today's movie audiences. I coudn't recommend this to anyone.,4,0,3,19 August 2006
Match Point," Not a masterpiece but entertaining.
","An ex tennis player turned pro marries into a wealthy British family but has his eyes on his brother-in-law's girlfriend. You know this is going to be good from the start, but some reviewers here are suggesting that this is a masterpiece and frankly its not. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johannson are not convincing and some clever twists in the second half really save an otherwise slow film. The operatic themes throughout didn't work for me and were overdone. Perhaps the main problem lies in the fact that no one in the film is likable except for the father. Everyone else is so selfish and stupid. I could not muster up even a grain of sympathy for any of the characters and felt they deserved all they got. I actually hoped that they all might die in some terrible accident or similar tragedy in the end, but that never eventuated.",7,1,1,19 August 2006
Cast Away," Tom Hanks is Incredible
","At the time of its release, this was Tom Hanks best effort yet. As he appears in nearly every frame, the film relies heavily on his screen presence and acting. Amazingly he pulls it off with considerable ease. I loved the narration and the way it was filmed, especially on the island. When it comes to realism, the plane crash was one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. In western society we come to expect so many everyday comforts as the norm and living without them is both disconcerting and frustrating. The central character's daily frustrations and loneliness are well presented and we all felt great empathy with him throughout. Plus, having audience members nearly in tears over a basketball is no mean feat, but that's what happened. Everything worked well and the story was rewarding in so many ways, especially towards the end. I found this film difficult to fault, incredibly enjoyable and would recommend it to all without reservation.",10,3,4,31 July 2014
North by Northwest," Should have watched this film a long time ago.
","Despite being in my 40s, I have only just discovered Alfred Hitchcock and have over the last few months, started watching his films. Initially i thought, that due to their age, they would not fare well against more recent movies. I could not have been more wrong.North by Northwest on a big widescreen in Dolby 5.1 surround is simply great. Sure some of the dialogue seems clumsy and dated, but you have to consider the type of censorship that would have existed when this film was released in 1959. The sort of 'colourful' language we take for granted today would never have been allowed. Also some of the 'special effects' are lame by today's standards. But the way in which the story unfolds is just incredible and just great fun to watch. It was simply entertaining. Something that today's special effects blockbusters often fail to accomplish. I eagerly look forward to my next Hitchcock film.",8,0,0,29 July 2006
The Hurt Locker," Yeah it's good but it's no classic.
","The consensus here regarding the greatness of this film has changed considerably over the last few months. When it first appeared it was regarded as a so-so Iraqi war drama but over time the hype has raised the film to iconic status. Recent BAFTA awards (what were they thinking?) confirm that thinking. I saw the movie several months ago and I still believe it is a good movie, well worth watching as it has some tense moments that really are 'edge of the seat' stuff but the biggest miss with this film is the main character. Me, I like to like the main character(s). The film starts off impressively due entirely to Guy Pearce's performance as SSG Matt Thompson but then he gets killed! I couldn't possibly like his replacement SSG William James. He is one stupid yet incredibly lucky soldier who risks his own life and the life of his colleagues. He is certainly no hero. If I had liked him this film could have been a 10/10 not a 8/10. Further, I discovered this too early into the story and my impression doesn't change when the DVD kid goes missing and is presumably found very dead. The real highlight for me was the encounter with the British and subsequent sniper scenario. I thought it was brilliant, but either side was a just too much Hollywood clich√©. Going home to his loving family, a family, by the way that James finds droll and boring and his subsequent return to service was just the nail in the coffin. If it was up to me, Pearce would have been cast in the lead role, he would have been killed right near the end and the film would have been sensational. District 9 will be getting my vote for the standout pic of the year.",8,2,5,28 February 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Better than I'd hoped
","It must be difficult to make an enjoyable film based on historical events especially when the outcome is well known. In this case they succeeded and I really enjoyed 'Good Night, and Good Luck'. The acting was great and the way archival material was utilized was exceptionally good.If pressed I found it lacking in two areas. Although it was set in the late 1950s, for some reason it didn't feel like the 50s. I cannot work out why. Perhaps the picture and sound quality were just too good. I don't really know. I also think that not enough was made known about Ed Murrow's reputation previous to the McCarthy era. It was an important point that seemed to be glossed over.",8,0,0,29 July 2014
Mulholland Drive," Quite a ride.
","The female leads in this movie really shine. While Naomi Watts and Laura Harring both excel, I find myself wondering why Ms Harring has not had more big roles in recent times as she is obviously a very talented and beautiful actress. I also thought that Anne Miller was well cast as the apartment block manager and she displayed a great deal of that 'Hollywood charm' that is completely lacking in modern cinema.David Lynch as a director is quite special. The way he layers a story and his quirky photography make it obvious who is at the reins here. But as he he done many times before, he forgets that the cinema is first and foremost a place to tell a story. If one makes a story difficult to follow that doesn't always make it art. Lynch is capable of telling a great story with films like 'The Elephant Man', but he's gone off on a bender here trying to appease God knows who.There will be many who didn't understand the film trying to point out out the genius, the relevance or even the brilliance of this movie, but they are kidding themselves. It is painfully obvious that a re-edit of this film, while removing some of Lynch's style, would transform this film into the masterpiece it could have been. As it stands, watching Mulholland Dr. is too difficult and asks too much of its audience.Despite all of these shortcomings, I actually liked the film as I thought the actors did an incredible job. It's just that it could have been so much better. It could have been a classic.",7,1,3,15 March 2007
La La Land," Adequate as far as musicals go.
","I'm a huge musicals fan and I went into this film expecting something quite special. There was so much build-up. So much hype. The opening sequence was incredible, despite my not being able to understand the lyrics most of the time. The dance sequence was a joy to watch. So I sat back and was ready to be impressed. It didn't happen.Basically a romance, the story was passable. Ryan Gosling's character being a jazz zealot ass-wipe made him difficult to like. It fell into a massive hole about two-thirds in where the audience drifted off. The ending? Well it was just awful.The singing was very average. Neither Gosling or Stone have great singing voices.The music, which, let's face it, is quite important in a musical, was a major disappointment.I loved the dancing, the locations, the use of vivid colors and many other things but these weren't enough to offset the lackluster music and singingThe people watched this film may not have seen the classic musicals from decades ago. Perhaps that's why the IMDb score is so high. I hope that La La Land starts a resurgence in the musical genre. If it does, they will have to be much better than this effort.",7,1,6,14 April 2017
The Da Vinci Code," A Roller-coaster ride its not!
","Of the many hyped-up films of recent times this is perhaps the most disappointing. It could have been a great film but as it's finally presented it is not. Within about twenty minutes of the start, we become disinterested in the numerous revelations along the way because they are thrust at us like a huge sword at every opportunity and then only to keep us awake during the often tedious journey ahead. I'm of the opinion that most of the faults of this film are attributable to Ron Howard's directing. Apart from Apollo 13, his films are drawn out and he has trouble getting the actors to do their stuff. Audrey Tautou as the French agent would have been credible had she not been paired with Tom Hanks for most of the film. Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany were great in their roles, but Tom Hanks looks very out of place and frequently resorts to a 'what am I doing here?' look on his face. He looks totally lost. Overall, The Da Vinci Code is around an hour too long. There is just far too much repetitive dialogue, as if to make points obvious to the dullest of audience members, and far too little actual story telling. However, the film is far from a total loss as it does pose some interesting questions and the car being driven through busy Paris traffic in reverse was OK but as far as plot twists go most are predictable. Perhaps the marketing hype just worked too well on me and I set my expectations too high, but I think not.",6,0,1,22 October 2006
Arrival," One of the best sci-fi movies ever.
","Science Fiction movies are so diverse. There are successful ones like the Star Wars series that I don't even regard as Science Fiction as it's more a fantasy. The science part of Science Fiction is overlooked far too much in Star Wars. I understand that when you go to see a movie you need to suspend disbelief but many ask you to believe in new laws of physics that make zero sense or forget evolution and allow aliens to look like humans. Then there are movies like 'The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)' and 'Interstellar' that I regard as brilliant.Arrival is most definitely in the latter group. Early on it is difficult to grasp where it's going but it gathers momentum quickly and the story is not only beautifully told, it's also thoroughly satisfying. It's clever Science Fiction. The aliens themselves were a great choice. Despite their appearance, animals on earth that are similar have complex nervous systems and behaviors, excellent vision, high intelligence and communicate with each other. Communication is the key to this movie as is linguist, Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. The plot revolves around her being recruited to interpret the alien's language. Amy Adams carries the movie. Much is asked of her and she delivers. I'm shocked that she didn't get a best actress Oscar nomination.'Arrival' is beautiful, complex, and cerebral. One of the best Science Fiction movies ever.",9,3,9,1 February 2017
Straight Outta Compton," Don't bother.
","I didn't have high expectations for this but I knew the characters portrayed and was interested in their history. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the direction appears to have no purpose. The music has not stood the test of time and is now dull, repetitious and tries far too hard. It is amazing to look back and believe that these people and their 'music' became popular at all. Rap lacks any real innovation and doesn't seem to have progressed very far since the 1980s. It needs to steer away from the violence and misogyny that it popularizes and I wonder why women don't complain out loudly about this. The actual story is so stereotypical and formulaic that it became tedious to watch very early on and made it difficult to stay interested. After watching I cannot believe the high rating the film has here and I can only put it down to some earnest fans and their friends voting for the music rather than the story.",4,91,214,28 December 2015
Black Panther," Very disappoinring
","Allow me to preface my review by saying I have loved all the previous Marvel Universe movies. However, I found Black Panther a yawnfest. It seemed to lack the feel of the other movies in the franchise and I was really struggling to watch all of it until the end. It was such a relief when those credits rolled.ActuallyI thought the acting was good but the plot was lacking. It seemed to be going nowhere very slowly most of the time. I couldn't relate to the characters either which meant I didn't like any of them. If they make a sequel, I hope it's at least interesting.Overall a disappinting effort from Marvel but I still look forward to the next installment.",6,4,5,3 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," Disappointingly familiar
","I recall giving the original movie 10/10 but Covenant is simply a disappointment. Oddly enough if the other movies were never made and this was at totally new story it might be regarded as a pretty good sci-fi flick, but it's not new and its predecessors were far superior. So what was wrong with it? The most irritating aspect was that the characters were plain stupid. The crew exhibited little evidence of scientific training or discipline and got what they deserved. I couldn't muster any sympathy for the characters and found myself at times cheering for the aliens. The plot itself was thoroughly predictable and the twists more so. The ending was an insult to the audience. We've seen it all before and now it's all too familiar so there's no horror or shock value. Only worth watching if you've never seen the first three movies. This is by far the worse of the 'Alien ' series of movies.",5,2,3,2 August 2017
