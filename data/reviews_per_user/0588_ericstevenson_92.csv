Blade Runner 2049," It's worth it
","'Blade Runner' was a classic movie and not in the way most people would even suspect. This sequel had an absence of 35 years between films so it's unlikely they'd make a worthy successor. Turns out they did! I loved this, but not as much as most people. What's impressive is that I was initially disappointed because I wanted to see Harrison Ford come back to reprise his role but after half the movie was done, he still wasn't there. Finally he comes in at the 105 minute mark! He took his time. This manages to capture the spirit of the original so well.I thought I'd love the original because it would be this big epic action movie. Instead, it blew me away with its fantastic visuals and uniqueness. And guess what? This movie gives us the exact same way. I'm simply once again blown away by how beautiful this film looks and how clever the writing is. The final twist may in fact be the best part and the buildup is great. I won't spoil it for you as this is a film that must be seen to be believed. ***1/2",9,1,7,19 October 2017
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," As bad as it gets
","I knew I had to see this movie sometime especially after the lengthy review that Doug Walker gave it and how much he hated it. This is a guy who loved the other movies because of how bad they were. I specifically downloaded the Rifftrax file for this movie as a free sample and I was devastated to find out that the website has apparently changed and all my history was deleted so I had to buy the file for this movie. It was money well spent because I would have gone nuts if not for the file. This movie is amazingly boring and stupid in nearly every sense of the word.I actually looked up critical reviews and I think even people who were fans of the other movies hated this one. I guess I will give those other movies credit for being better. This movie features Edward and Bella getting married. Bella gets pregnant and most of this movie is just them talking about whether she should have an abortion. Okay they don't use the word 'abortion' but it's what they're talking about. This is just a nasty unpleasant movie for me because everyone in this film is just so mean. Everybody is telling Bella to get rid of her fetus because it's killing her. This is just an uncomfortable movie with how they show Bella slowly get sicker because this vampire fetus is sucking the life out of her.Everybody just wants this fetus dead. I mean they really do use words like 'that thing', 'bloodsucker' and 'demon' when describing a fetus. I don't see how anyone can defend such a mean spirited message. They call the fetus 'it' over and over. This film is just depressing with how bitter everyone is. It just gets worse as time goes on. I am so glad this is the last 'Twilight' movie I'll ever watch in my life. Apparently, there has somehow never been a vampire that's gotten a human pregnant before. During sex, Edward is literally destroying the beds and giving Bella bruises, which she's mostly okay with.The Rifftrax had tons of great stuff and I especially like, 'Oh honey, everyone's gone! Our unholy marriage must have triggered the rapture!'. I also loved when they referred to Jacob and said, 'Hi, runner up!'. I got a chuckle out of, 'I drink your bloodshake!' too. Okay, did they really have to make a joke about bronies? I mean, I'm glad they acknowledge them, but don't say anything bad about us. I think this is the first time I've heard them riff through the credits, although they do stop at some point. Anywho, this is a trashy movie no one should watch. *",2,0,0,11 February 2017
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Could be better or worse
","This was about as mediocre as I thought it would be. It's nothing to write home about. Well, I guess it is something to write a review about. Anyway, this chapter features the characters finding a new place free from zombies. There's little plot besides that. That's probably the film's biggest fault. It doesn't have much of a story other than them going to a place where people are supposedly safe. I guess the action scenes aren't bad. The main problem with this is the slow motion. I think it's probably the fault of the 3D people, but there are many times where it just isn't done well.I also kind of blame the 3D for having bad CGI. This is why Roger Ebert was opposed to this sort of thing! I having seen the last two movies but am not a fan of either these movies or the actual video games to really get invested to want to see them all. Besides, there's too many to list by now. They're supposedly over, I believe. I guess if you just want mindless zombie stuff, this is the movie for you. I know a tad bit about the games and from what I know, this is in fact pretty faithful. Other entries are at least slightly better. **",5,0,3,25 June 2017
It," It is good
","Well, I just wanted to say that I think this may very well be my favorite movie of the entire year. I was so impressed by how this movie had been hyped up and how it actually lived up to said hype! I was so eager to see this movie that I actually started reading the original 'It' novel by Stephen King. I am glad to be back into reading novels. I realize I've been so obsessed with movies I've lost an old love. Anyway, this is a film that just keeps getting better and better. I think it's much better than the original 'It'. Then again, I found the original to be just okay. It's mostly the second half where things in that mini-series get goofy.Of course, this did only cover the first half of the book so maybe it'll get worse later. I'm really glad that Pennywise only talked a little in the movie as he became much more intimidating as a silent antagonist. I still loved his voice and I love how they've changed the design from the miniseries, although I don't remember if the book was very different. This movie takes place in the 1980's instead of the 1950's that the book takes place in at this part. It's great to update a story but not changing any important details to make it more relevant to a modern age, or I guess a 1980's age.Richie is probably my favorite character as he had some of the best lines. It's weird how the film works great serious yet it's actually more intentionally funny than a lot of horrible comedies. Well, what wouldn't be? I thought the film was going to end after only 85 minutes as it certainly seemed like that, but the four star rating from this came after they continued it and had this awesome climax. In the mini-series, they just defeat Pennywise with silver. In this movie, they instead beat him up and learn not to fear him. That's way more awesome. There's nothing after the credits, though. ****",10,6,16,8 September 2017
Wayne's World," So 90s
","I admit to not having seen the original sketches for this on 'Saturday Night Live'. I have seen many SNL sketches but for whatever reason, none of the ones that were made into movies. I remember back when Mike Myers was funny. To think, I thought of his older movies as being stupid. Now, we unfortunately have 'The Cat In The Hat' and 'The Love Guru'. This might be the best live-action movie he ever worked on.I admit that some of the jokes don't really work. Most of them still do and boy are they funny. I think my favorite would have the be the gags where they keep making product placement after product placement. I do find myself caring for these goofy characters. I also love how everything builds up and is relevant to the story later. They even acknowledge that. ***",8,0,0,7 March 2018
The Big Lebowski," 'Got anymore of that good sarsaparilla?'
","I'm going to say that this is the best movie I've reviewed for Channel Awesome Month. It's constantly referenced by the Nostalgia Critic obviously and a ton of other people. What makes this movie so great is that there's so much going on and yet in the end it's mostly pointless. Actually, it's worse than that. Things are probably worse off now that Donnie is dead and he even dies from something that isn't even related to the main conflict of the story. But you know what? We had a great time while it was going on. Movies like 'Monty Python And The Holy Grail' are ultimately pointless, but that doesn't mean we're not entertained like mad while the movie was going. This movie tells the story of a guy named Lebowski or 'The Dude' who meets a rich guy also called Lebowski. He's the Big Lebowski and he wants the Dude to rescue his wife. I didn't even realize Philip Seymour Hoffman was in this movie. We have such a fantastic cast with Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore. This is one of the most profane movies ever made with 260 f-words (although I only counted 258, I knew I lost my count a few times). They even manage to play with that. There are many four minute segments that feature no swearing at all to emphasis the more dramatic tone here. I guess it's ironic that the most beloved sports movie of all time happens to be one about bowling, not much of a competitive sport. It's truly heartwarming when The Stranger talks to us at the very end. He says that even though things were mostly bad for the dude, at least he can keep a positive attitude and if nothing else, live the life he wants to. Yeah, this is Steve Buscemi's best movie (I recently saw 'Reservoir Dogs') and John Goodman's best too. ****",10,1,3,20 April 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Hello, Vader!
","I remember first hearing about this movie and thinking that it simply couldn't be good because a 'Star Wars' spin off movie has never worked before. Every single one of them was worse than 'The Phantom Menace'. I find it astounding everyone still complains about it when there's four films that are worse. I just got done with 'The Star Wars Holiday Special', the first of these, so I didn't have high hopes. I consider a 'Star Wars' spin off film to be any that doesn't have the 'Episode' in its title in some format. This qualifies and it's a great movie.When I heard they were reshooting scenes, it made me think of that disappointing 'Suicide Squad' movie. Even with the editing, it still came out bad, so I'm glad to know it actually worked here. I was afraid of J. J. Abrams not working on it, but it was great. I do feel kind of bad seeing as how I don't remember many of these new characters' names. At the time, this has a higher rating than last year's 'Star Wars' movie. We are going to have one theatrically released movie in this series for a long time. I personally don't find it as good, but it's easily better than all the other spin off movies combined.I remember watching 'Revenge Of The Sith' and realizing that they were going to have to kill off all the characters that don't appear in the original trilogy. Yep, this killed off every single one of them, but dang, did we have fun with these guys. I have no clue if any of these characters were from Expanded Universe material. Will the HK-47 ever appear? Anyway, what I love about this movie is how beautiful it looks. We get all of these wonderful locations that are so unique. Some complained about the film being too long and I will admit that it is a fault. Darth Vader looks great and it's great to see him again.It's weird to see Carrie Fisher being shown so young and find out that in real life, she might die. RIP Kenny Baker. The action scenes are great. This might be the first time they directly mention something from the prequels. They mention the Clone Wars, but I think those were briefly mentioned in the original trilogy too. Anyway, it's amazing how they build up to directly the scene before the original movie. It must be seen to be believed! The beginning is wonderfully subtle too. It's great to see behind the story of the canon. I have no idea whether any of my reviews will be liked, but vote however you want. See it! ***1/2",9,2,10,25 December 2016
Captain Marvel," I love that cat
","This movie starts off by showing Captain Marvel (I'll just call her that) in space fighting the Skrulls. I admit that I was hoping this would turn into a scenario like 'Thor' where she would go to Earth and be unfamiliar with the surroundings. Guess what happened next? This actually takes place in 1995. To really hammer it in, they have her crashing into a Blockbuster in the opening scene. It's funny to see how long it took for computers to load in that time.The scene stealer is Goose the cat (?). He's revealed to be an alien that can have tentacles come out of his mouth to fight. It's great to see before the initiative for the Avengers was even formed. I especially love finding out how Nick Fury lost his eye...a cat scratch! There's this great twist that happens halfway through the movie timed so perfectly. It's great to have such a great movie be the MCU's first one to stare a woman! ***1/2",9,14,42,26 March 2019
Alien: Resurrection," What's with you, Critic?
","I really admit that if it wasn't for the Nostalgia Critic's funny review of this movie I would have probably liked this more. Then again, I noticed a lot of the problems while I was watching the movie. It looks like this is the last in the Alien series chronological wise. The new movies are better, but of course not as good as the oldest ones. I actually really did like the special effects in this movie. It's weird because it actually starts with this really stupid CGI shot of a fly, but it gets much better. There are so many things that don't make sense.In the scene where the guy with the Xenomorph was attacking the villain, I had no clue what was going on. Was the alien mind controlling him? Well, it does lead to a pretty cool scene. The first half hour of this movie is pretty boring too. Around the third part, it does get its best parts because the action is nice. The problem is, this film doesn't bring anything new to the Alien mythology. I guess there is this new alien creature that appears at the end, but even that was poorly designed. Sigourney Weaver is still nice and yes, she actually literally made that backwards basketball shot in the film. **",5,0,0,28 July 2017
Shaun of the Dead," Well, that was really strange
","For Comedy Month, I wanted to watch this movie because a friend of mine said it was his favorite comedy. The weird thing is that while this definitely made me laugh a lot, it didn't seem like it was entirely a comedy. There honestly were a lot of dramatic moments in this and they were done very well. I can't really say it works better as a drama because it's certainly hilarious. I was impressed at how there were literally dozens of pop culture references in this. I might have to see this movie again just to get all of them. Well, it's about this guy who, after breaking up his girlfriend, slowly realizes that zombies are taking over the town. They don't have as good chemistry as in 'Deadpool 2', but it's still very fun to watch. I love how he keeps telling people not to use the word 'zombie'. We seem to get some of our best material at the very end and beginning. It's a film that really does make you want to look around and notice everything. I personally find 'Zombieland' to be better, but this is great too. ***1/2",9,0,1,30 June 2018
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Good, but could have been so much better
","This film was made in the first three seasons of 'South Park' and the funny thing is that Trey Parker and Matt Stone say they hate the first three seasons of the show. I don't know if they've ever said that about this movie. Butters appears in this film, but has no lines. It's a shame, because Butters is my favorite character and it was when he had a role that the show really took off. The plot is that Kyle's mother wages war on Canada when the Terrance and Philip movie inspires the kids to swear.This used to be the animated movie with the most swearing until 'Sausage Party' came out. I wonder if Trey Parker is mad at those guys? 'Casino', 'Summer of Sam', 'Wolf Of Wall Street' have literally THRICE as many f-words as this film and this IS a film about swearing! The closest there ever came to a second 'South Park' movie was the Imaginationland trilogy but that was never intended to be a movie. My favorite joke is still, 'Haven't you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?' This is followed by, 'I don't listen to hip hop'. ***",8,0,0,12 June 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Hmm...not bad
","Well, the score here isn't that high, but it's certainly enough for a good movie. I admit to knowing little about the 'Prince Of Persia' games. Then again, that might be for the better. Seeing as how video game movies so poorly represent their source material, I don't what to know if they botched it. Well, this is quite faithful as far as I know. I had no idea Ben Kingsley would be in another video game movie, not that it would be hard to be in a better movie than 'BloodRayne'. I guess the film's biggest strengths are how nice it looks and how the actors are fairly good. It's probably the best live-action video game adaptation I've ever seen.I simply have to say good things like this on at least one of these movies. I admit the plot is a little weak. It didn't seem to really explain how the magic dagger worked that well. Still, as far as leave your brain at the door movies go, this was quite enjoyable. It certainly has interesting ideas and it does have some nice twists. I do like how he initially thinks his father was killed by his brother but it's really his uncle. Does that make this a loose interpretation of 'Hamlet'? It's a fairly fun movie. ***",7,2,2,22 June 2017
Troy," Did this do poorly at the box office?
","I thought I heard somewhere that this movie was a box office bomb or did poorly financially. It became infamous or something. I must have been thinking about the movie 'Alexander'. I was also reminded of '300' while watching this. How many movies featuring loosely based historical battles were there made at this time? Anyway, I guess I'm not that familiar with the Illiad and I'm not even sure how factual it is. Then again, this didn't have any supernatural stuff, so it seemed pretty realistic to me. I admit that a flaw of this was that it was a bit too long.It seemed to take way too long for the famous Trojan horse to appear. It's still a good movie. It's odd how a fair number of critics didn't like it even though Leonard Maltin gave it three and a half stars. Good for you, Leonard! What I love about this movie is how epic it is. We get such wonderfully detailed battle scenes. I think my favorite part would be when they shoot these flaming arrows and then throw boulders that are engulfed with fire at their enemies! Most of this movie is just dialogue and fighting. It's still good because the acting is nice and it's a beautiful film to just look at. ***",7,1,1,12 February 2017
Terminator Salvation," I've now seen every Terminator movie!
","I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in this because it was the movie that gave us the infamous Christian Bale rant. Yeah, I don't hold that against the guy, but the remixes have been pretty funny. I actually do like what they do with this movie. It's mostly how they do something different by having the film set entirely in the future. You could call me a 'Terminator' fan as I probably love the series as much as anyone else. The best scene is probably when they fight the underwater robots. That shows off true creativity.I was just kind of disappointed how the climax turned out. It was by no means bad, but I guess with all the tension built up, I was expecting some huge battle between the humans and robots. Instead, it was just two Terminators fighting, which is more or less what we've seen in the other movies. This movie seemed to have the right length. The main problem I have is that it does comes off as rather pointless. It's by no means an awful movie. It just came off as pretty forgettable to me. I guess there's technically nothing that good or bad about it. The other films are better.I find the third movie to be better than this, which did better with critics. It captured the spirit of the first two movies better. This moves a little slowly at times and the moral is a pretty obvious one. While I'd advice you to skip it, it definitely has good ideas and uses them fairly well unlike 'Terminator: Genesys'. I think it might have worked better if it had taken place partly in the past and partly in the future.**1/2 out of ****.",6,1,3,29 April 2016
Aquaman," You'd think an Aquaman movie would be bad
","This is the second best movie in the DC Cinematic Universe next to 'Wonder Woman'. I think the only character that I knew before watching the movie was Black Manta. He's actually the secondary villain as the main one is Aquaman's half brother. I admit that I can tell that the director saw the 'Thor' movies. Even Aquaman's bulk is like Thor's. Probably this film's biggest strengths is how beautiful and colorful it is. The Earth is mostly covered in water, so it only makes sense we should have movies that take place underwater!I do wish that Black Manta was in this more. It does get kind of too silly at times, especially with how they suddenly have monsters and dinosaurs randomly appear! There's still no doubt that this is a very creative film. While not as good as 'Black Panther' or 'Avengers: Infinity War' it's still a film people should watch if only because of how popular it is. Trust me when I say there's tons of great action and creativity everywhere! Yes, we get a nice romance story in too...but not as good as Thor's. ***",8,0,2,8 February 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," Again, not what I expected
","I remember looking up on Amazon.com and seeing that this film was seemingly the most reviewed anime thing on the entire website! It was that alone that made me want to watch this. Yeah, I'm like that. I admit that I was confused as to how a lot of the movie didn't really focus on the title character. He didn't even appear until 32 minutes into the movie! Now, this is still a great movie. You simply can't go wrong with this animation from the creator of 'Castle In The Sky' which I looked at recently. I am so impressed at how this artwork holds up after all these decades. Honestly, it seems on par with his newest stuff like 'Ponyo'! I had no idea that they were actually going to get into some pretty deep issues here. This movie features two daughters whose mother is away sick. In this sense, it actually improves on better movies like 'Spirited Away' because we actually get to see the supernatural stuff weaved into their everyday lives. It also helps that they have this awesome catbus. Yeah, literally a giant cat that's also a bus. It makes little sense, but dang do I love looking at that guy. I'm surprised at how short it was, seeing as how Miyazaki was known for making longer films. ***1/2",9,1,2,21 February 2017
Deadpool 2," Happy birthday to me!
","This movie is the best film I've seen all year! I just have to type this review down right now because it's my 29th birthday today and this was the perfect way to celebrate it! This movie actually opens with Deadpool's girlfriend being killed. He then tries to become a member of the X-Men. There's this hilarious joke where he complains about the other X-Men not appearing. That was actually my favorite joke of his from the original film. We then see all the other X-Men in the next room quickly closing the door to stay out of the movie! I remember loving the first movie, but thinking it was missing something. I just wish it had Deadpool reference Pinkie Pie. And guess what he does here?! He even winks at the audience probably referencing all the fan works the two of them appear in. I couldn't stop clapping in the theater! I think my only problem with the first movie was that there were some serious scenes that just weren't handled well and seemed out of place and this improves on that! There's even this great scene at the end where he goes to Heaven to meet his girlfriend. Be sure to stay until the end credits, which feature him killing himself from 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' and killing himself again (well, Ryan Reynolds) after getting the script to 'Green Lantern'. Cable is played by the same guy as Thanos from 'Avengers: Infinity War' and he even does the same thing! He sets time back! It's a pure laugh riot from beginning to end with fantastic visuals, characters, and fight scenes. It's a film that must be watched to truly be appreciated. ****",10,4,9,24 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," My 1,000th review!
","After years (or at least close to that time) of being on this website writing reviews, I am very happy to say that this is my one thousandth review! I knew I had to do something special for such a monumental occasion and I did so by reviewing the most critically acclaimed movie of the year! This is the best 'Thor' movie and the most recent in one of the best years for superhero movies ever! We've been going through nothing but hits this year! Okay okay, back to the movie. This film features Thor and Loki going back to Asgard to fight Thor's evil sister, Hela. Honestly, that's mostly the whole plot.It doesn't mean we can't have a great time with this modern classic! Every other Marvel movie featured all the Avengers together or just one of them but this one actually has two of them, Thor and the Hulk! It's easily the best Hulk movie. The best part about the movie is how beautiful it looks. I mean, it seems like every image of this film shows off gorgeous colors and lush environments. We got tons of zany stuff happening and there's never a dull moment here. We get tons of great jokes in the process too.I laughed out loud when they mentioned Thor turning into a frog. Yes, that was an actual thing that happened in the comics. My only complaint is that they got rid of the Natalie Portman character and I really liked that couple! I admit that I'm kind of indifferent to Jeff Goldblum but he was wonderfully entertaining in this as was everyone else. I feel bad for not reading Thor comics because I don't recognize any of these new characters. I assume they're from the comics at least. It's this reason why I love film so much and why I've written a thousand reviews here! ****",10,1,10,9 November 2017
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Give em Hell
","I am not a fan of Hellboy nor have I even seen the original movie. Don't be fooled by his name as he is in fact the hero. With everything being based on Marvel or DC nowadays (okay, mostly Marvel) it's great to look at a superhero made by another company, Dark Horse. At first, I thought he was made by Image comics. I guess I have trouble telling those two apart. I admit that some of this film is hokey, but it's beautiful to look at, it doesn't really matter. It can be hard getting into a brand new franchise. The best part of this movie is how absolutely gorgeous it looks.The visuals and special effects are incredible. There are always new and abstract characters being introduced with all these unique designs. The fight scenes are all epic and wonderfully creative. There's just always some new wonderfully designed creature just appearing right around the corner in this movie. It of course helps that the main character is very enjoyable. I actually do get the relationships these characters have, even if there's not that much screen time devoted to it. It was made by the director of 'Pan's Labyrinth' and it's really easy to tell with the design. This film lacks that movie's emotion, but is still a lot of fun. ***1/2",9,0,0,14 April 2017
Silent Hill," The atmosphere was great
","Dang, why aren't they making movies based on video games that I'm actually familiar with? Anyway, this really is one of the better video game movies, because it honestly does have really good atmosphere. I am at least familiar with some of the characters from the 'Silent Hill' games, especially Pyramid Head. Oh come on, everyone's heard of Pyramid Head! So this happens to be the longest movie ever made based on a video game...until 'Ace Attorney' came along. This film really was genuinely creepy at many times. Now, I think you did have to be a fan of the games to really enjoy it.I would recommend it to people who are. For people who aren't, it's just alright. I admit that the CGI is actually pretty bad at many times in this movie. Well, there are other shots that are just fine. I do kind of like the characters in this movie even if they're not that great. It actually gets confusing in the middle of the film. It's when all of these other people show up and the tone of the movie starts to change. Again, probably something from the games. It's hard to find a video game movie that would appear to fans outside the series. Still, a very nice try. **1/2",6,4,6,12 June 2017
Ready Player One," Happy Easter!
","What better way to celebrate Easter than by watching a movie where an Easter egg is a main plot point? I had no idea this was based on a book. I didn't recognize any notable actors here apart from T. J. Miller. This movie tells the story of how in the future there's this virtual reality world called the Oasis. The creator died and said whoever found his Easter egg after collecting three keys will inherit his fortune. I admit the characterizations could be better.The real selling point is how beautiful this film looks. It features a practically incalculable number of cameos of fictional characters. The one with the most screen time is the Iron Giant and he deserves it. The final battle is easily the best part, although the 'Shining' bit was great too. It seems like we're getting more and more movies with tons of cameos. Not great, but it was certainly unique. ***I regret to inform everyone that this is going to be my last review on this website. I've been doing this for probably years but it just isn't fun anymore. It seems like everyone here hates me anyway. April Fool's!",8,3,9,2 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Odd title
","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in 'Batman'. I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in 'Spider-Man 2'. While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2",9,25,45,10 July 2017
The Expendables," I got what I expected
","I guess the only reason I was interested in seeing this was because it was the last (or one of the last) movies to ever be reviewed on Siskel and Ebert or Ebert and Roeper or Roeper or whatever. I really didn't need to know anything about the plot at all, given that it was just a movie about a bunch of action stars getting together and blowing stuff up. That's what I thought I was getting and that's exactly what I got. There actually is a major complaint I have. The most famous star of all was Arnold Schwarzenegger and he barely appears in the film at all! I mean, I thought he'd at least appear at the end to rescue everybody.That really did annoy me. Even Bruce Willis didn't have much screen time. So, this movie features a bunch of action scenes and killing in all sorts of ways. The action was decent, but there just wasn't anything that good about the characters. It especially got clichéd at the end when they were talking about how the hero and villain were similar and everything. I guess I like the settings. It's just really nothing you haven't seen in many other action movies. I heard Eric Roberts was the most prolific actor out there and it was nice to see him in this movie. **1/2",6,0,0,24 March 2017
Blade II," A superhero movie?
","Nowadays, we live in the golden age of superhero movies where great films of the kind are always around the corner. This film was made at a time that now seems like ancient history when it comes to superhero movies. I didn't like how I wasn't familiar with any of the characters. I went through the Marvel Encyclopedia and don't remember seeing any of these guys. It works much better as just a standard action movie. It's often fight scene after fight scene with vampires being killed over and over.There is still much better creativity in this movie than most of the Transformers films. They do at least manage to expand on the vampire mythology. I knew that was the guy who played Daryl from 'The Walking Dead'! I personally didn't care for the original Blade movie. I felt this was better as I was more accustomed to the setting and it didn't feel like they were just repeating stuff. Dozens of better superhero movies exist now, but as an early film, this wasn't half bad. I admit some of the effects don't hold up that well. ***",7,1,2,16 May 2018
Suicide Squad," Not that memorable
","This movie is notable in featuring the first theatrical released appearance of Harley Quinn. She was a character introduced in 'Batman: The Animated Series' and is arguably the most identifiable canon immigrant. I really do appreciate how good the colors are in this film. Well, it kind of works both ways. The costumes are really nicely done and the credits are especially good and colorful. I just don't like the lighting effects here. It comes off as pretty ugly with all the darkness.Amanda Waller appears and is portrayed fairly well. I feel bad for not knowing more of these characters. I can't find the DC Encyclopedia at Books A Million! Then again, they don't even have an article on the Anti-Monitor. The Joker is portrayed well too. I was disappointed that he only has a few minutes of screen time. There's just no set up for his appearances. I knew he'd be too evil to appear on this squad. This film went through reshooting supposedly because of the poor ratings received by 'Batman V. Superman'. Now, this has the same ratings, so it didn't get much better.I also have a problem with the pacing of this story. It's mostly just one big mission that these guys go on. I just think it's rushed and it should have been divided up better. The special effects are pretty nice. This movie has been anticipated for a long time and for most people, it was a disappointment. Well, the audiences liked it better than the critics. It was weird to see another random cameo from the Flash. Even the scene during the credits was pretty dull. This is a mixed bag and while it definitely has its amusing moments, I say you can suit this one out. **",5,0,0,15 October 2016
Taxi Driver," Four stars from the get go
","I didn't even know this movie was directed by Martin Scorsese. I was quite impressed by such an all star cast, even Frank Boyle. Wait, was he always bald? This film's plot just seems to go all over the place. I didn't even know this was the movie with the famous line, 'You talking to me?'. That seems like such a generic thing to say, but I still think of it every time I say that. The plot is that Robert DeNiro plays Travis, a taxi driver (duh!) who is dissatisfied with his job. He falls for a woman named Betsy, but their relationship ends badly. He tries to become physically stronger and more intimidating by working out and using all sorts of weapons. He comes across an underage prostitute named Iris. He decides to free her from her pimp. This is a movie where there's a lot going on, but it's still easy to pay attention to, which is always a plus.Leonard Maltin shockingly only gave this film two out of four stars, complaining that it was too violent. Honestly, it's not really violent until the climax. What matters is how unbelievably 70's this movie is. It works so well as a time capsule, making you reflect on pop culture at that time. This film became infamous because it allegedly inspired Ronald Reagan's failed assassin, who wanted to impress Jodie Foster. Ironic seeing as how the film itself features a failed assassination, but no one is wounded. ****",10,3,5,23 July 2018
Doctor Strange," As awesome as it gets
","I now officially have more disliked reviews than liked reviews on this website. I'm going to keep on making these reviews because I still love film. I mean no ill will towards anyone and only wish to speak my opinion. Anyway, this was one of the best Marvel movies ever made! Yeah, you can expect every Marvel movie now to be in the Cinematic Universe. I am not that familiar with Doctor Strange but certainly recognize the character and his powers. Is a sorcerer the same as a wizard? I'm pretty sure it's similar. You could compare it to Harry Potter, I suppose.Except that this was for me, better than any Harry Potter movie! Honestly, this had some of the most wonderful visuals I have ever seen in a film. There's seriously not a moment where it looks like a special effect. I don't know if most of the effects were practical. What matters is that it looks amazing no matter what it was made with. Was I getting some 'Inception' vibe from this movie? You know, with all the buildings being curled around and everything. There's just so much creativity and they use this crazy world to its fullest potential. I love it when films create amazing places and do so much with them. I recognized most of the characters or at least by their names.This story is pretty basic with a surgeon literally named Doctor Strange becoming a sorcerer while trying to heal his hands. I've seen some movies based on the character. In fact, I think the 1978 TV movie version may have been the first Marvel movie ever made. I saw that and this was kind of like it, only it was actually good. Yes, I admit some of the story doesn't make that much sense like how he suddenly gets these powers so quickly. It doesn't matter, because it looks so awesome. As with other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, it has a great sense of humor. Some of the jokes are a bit expected, but always entertaining. Be sure to watch during the credits and then after the credits. We get most of the characters we want to see here. A treat for everyone! ****",10,0,5,20 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This is the end, folks
","I remember back when we all thought 'Revenge Of The Sith' would be the last 'Star Wars' movie, but now, it looks like it will be this. I'm sad to say that this is the least critically acclaimed Star Wars episode entry, even lower than 'The Phantom Menace'. That being said, I still enjoyed it and even saw it to commemorate my grandmother (and last living grandparent) dying. For a movie almost two and a half hours long, it really does go at a great pace for me. My complaints are the same as yours, as it's never really explained how Emperor Palpatine came back to life after falling down a shaft in 'Return Of The Jedi' that then exploded. You can tell they just wanted to bring the character back and for the little screen time he has, he does make it work.There's more dumb things about it, like what was the purpose of Palpatine even creating Snoke in the first place? Why didn't he just lead the Order by himself from the get go? Yes, it gets predictable with Kylo Ren reforming (he's a member of the Skywalker family, what'd you expect?), but overall it's worth checking out. I also liked having C-3PO playing a bigger role seeing as how in most of these movies, he's just there because he (and R2D2) are in every movie. Decide for yourself whether the prequels are better than the sequels as that is being addressed now. The other movies were way better, but for a conclusion, this is still nice. ***",8,4,15,27 January 2020
Romeo + Juliet," Pretty much worth it
","This was actually a pretty early attempt to modernize the classic 'Romeo And Juliet' story by placing it in modern times. I admit that some of the movie does come off as being off key. It's kind of weird to see a version of RAJ that begins with gunfire and explosions, but don't worry. The film gets much better later. Anyway, it's really fascinating to see how 90s this movie is. I mean, it pretty much envisions everything that made the 90s what it was and seeing as how it's an update of a classic story, that makes sense. For the most part, it's certainly good.The original dialogue is kept, but there is one big change near the end. Juliet actually briefly awakes and witnesses Romeo die. It's not that important, but it's still interesting to see something different with such a popular story. We're even told that the families have a rivalry that's implied to go back to the times of when the original story takes place. It even begins by showing us what happens at the very end. Seeing as how everyone knows how it ends, it's a very clever way of setting it up and it makes for a good movie. ***",8,1,1,16 August 2017
Justice League," Not that good or bad
","This movie is basically trying to be 'The Avengers' but it has a major flaw. It didn't have enough movies to flesh out all of its characters. The ending for me was really strange too. It featured the henchman of Steppenwolf smelling fear on him so they eat him? I admit to not being familiar with the comic character. Anyway, this still had a lot of amusing moments.Why can't they make a movie as good as 'Wonder Woman'? That was the perfect DC movie! It was at least better than 'Batman Vs. Superman' and 'Suicide Squad'. The characters play off of each other pretty well. It just that it isn't a very rewarding movie because it lacks a sense of epicness. So Cyborg's catch phrase was always 'Booyah!'.",6,0,1,2 January 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," Why are they whispering?
","'The Matrix' is one of my favorite movies. Seeing as how everyone was talking about how awful this one was, I was surprised that it had a rating of 6.7. I guess I agree that it's not good, but it's at least okay. Probably the best part is how it really does get better in the last two thirds. The first third of this movie is dreadfully boring and I just don't know why these actors aren't raising their voices. It makes everything rather bland. You can really notice the lack of emotion more in this, while it wasn't as apparent in the previous films. I think the main problem is how this film was paced.It shows twenty minutes of the humans in Zion fighting and then twenty minutes of Neo fighting. I would have enjoyed it more if it had combined the two. There was little variety that way. Nonetheless, there were definitely good things about the movie. The CGI is very good and it even seems to have improved from the last movie. Considering they were filmed right next to each other, that really is saying something. Hugo Weaving is just so entertaining as Smith. While it's difficult to take him seriously, it's still really hard to not be entertained on some level by this guy. I'm impressed by the sheer number of different roles he's had in popular franchises.I just love the idea of Smith escaping to the real world. They did that part fairly well. Then again, it might just be because like I said before, he's such an entertaining character.The basic story is that the humans are fighting the machines while Smith has taken over the Matrix. Neo decides to go to the machine leader to stop fighting if he defeats Smith. I admit that this conclusion is really too convenient and seems like a cop out. It's still nice to see the conclusion of such a popular movie series. I bought 'The Matrix' package films in one box set and I think it was money well spent. Even if the ending was mostly unsatisfactory, it's by no means awful. I guess I could recommend it if only because it's something that's really popular and does have some good variety. It even seems like they were trying to give all the characters some important role even though it didn't work out nearly as much as something like Return Of The King or Return Of The Jedi. I have a soft spot for third entries in a series...and also ones that have 'Return Of The' in the title for some reason. **1/2 out of ****.",6,0,0,1 May 2016
Pitch Black," I'm with the critics
","The basic plot of this movie is that people crash land on a planet and have to hide from the aliens. I think the weakest part of this movie is the plot. I mean, it's just too basic. Critics thought this was just okay while audiences liked it more. I'd have to go with the critics here. I had no idea this set up the Chronicles Of Riddick series.Well, I don't know much about that either. The designs of the aliens are quite good, but the problem is that the special effects aren't that good. I still like the landscapes, especially with how they show the planets. The actors, especially Vin Diesel, are likeable enough. Maybe I've just reached the point where I've seen so many movies that I need to be impressed more. Check out the later Fast and Furious movies for his better movies. **1/2",6,0,4,7 August 2018
Knowing," Not with Ebert
","I was first attracted to this movie because it just so happened to be the lowest rated movie ever made that was given four stars by Roger Ebert. This director also made 'Dark City', Ebert's favorite movie of 1998. I really doubted that I would like this, much less give it four stars, and I was pretty much right. This movie tells the story of a guy played by Nicolas Cage who finds a message written by a kid fifty years ago in a time capsule that's nothing but numbers. He realizes that she listed down all the major disasters in the upcoming 50 years. This raises too many questions. This girl/woman was alive and well for more decades, so why didn't she just tell everyone about the horrible things that would happening? I mean, she did predict the end of the world as the last thing she wrote down. Maybe she just assumed that since the world would end it wouldn't matter that all those other people died.But then why did she even write this down in the first place? For the positives of the film, I did find the special effects good and it actually does have a pretty original concept. I still couldn't help but think of 'Signs'. You know, a movie about a guy who lost his faith and learns about aliens coming and has to help two kids survive? I mean, the idea was original, it was just done in a clichéd manner. I do enjoy Nicolas Cage and it does have some rather intense moments. I have to give Ebert credit for giving the full score to such a, well, mediocre movie. I was never into disaster movies to begin with as they were too formulaic. A lot of the scenes just go nowhere and while not terrible, it's not worth your time, unless you want to learn more about Roger Ebert. **",5,0,1,17 August 2016
The Shining," How'd I miss it?
","'The Shining' is in fact the most referenced movie I had not seen before. It was great to be able to understand the endless number of homages to it, even though it didn't really show me a lot of new stuff. The movie itself is so good that it doesn't really matter if you know a lot about it as it's still great to watch. I think everyone knows the story. This was a great film for Book Month as I have actually read the book version of 'The Shining'. It was an awesome book and I don't think this movie was as good as it.There was a lot of backstory left out, but this is still great. What's notable is that in the book version, Jack Torrance is more sympathetic, doesn't kill anyone, and ultimately redeems himself. This is what caused author Stephen King to dislike the movie mostly because Jack is in fact based on King himself. I admit that Jack is definitely more villainous here and comes off as less caring of his family. Still, there are a lot of great references and a good portion of the plot is the same. I've seen nearly every Stanley Kubrick movie now.The music is a huge part of what makes this so enjoyable. It creates wonderful tension, especially during the more intense scenes. It's great from the get go, as we see everything set up so nicely. For a movie that's two and a half hours long, it sure didn't seem to go on forever. I guess it's because I'm familiar with the book which was fairly long. While I didn't like it as much as 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Dr. Strangelove', it's still wonderful. ****",10,0,1,9 January 2018
American Beauty," Well, I think it holds up
","It's always great to see a movie that won none other than Best Picture and I think this movie easily deserved it! This movie tells the story of a character played by Kevin Spacey named Lester who falls in love with a friend of his daughter's named Angela. There's an important subplot about a guy named Ricky next door who falls in love with the daughter. He is shown filming everything because he wants to see the beauty in the world. It's best represented when he has a video showing something as simple as a plastic bag drifting in the wind. Ricky's father, Colonel Fitts is an extreme homophobe.For awhile, it seems like they're avoiding the whole plot about Angela and Lester. What's so great is that they really only make it important at the very end. What is it with Kevin Spacey movies and having the last part of them be the best and most important part? It seems as though Lester is going to sleep with Angela, but thank God he realizes that's immoral! What's great is seeing how Angela makes him decide to change his life and do whatever he wants. I'm glad I understand some pop culture references to this.The movie ends with Lester being shot. His wife was seen with a handgun in a previous scene, so obviously she did it. It then turns out it was Colonel Fitts who earlier was actually revealed to be gay himself as he almost kissed Lester. Supposedly, he killed him to cover up the fact that was gay himself. The part where Fitts thinks his son his gay is probably the best and most intense part of the movie! The music is amazing and I love how it ends by saying you can still see beauty in everything. ****",10,0,0,23 April 2018
Duck Soup," 'Fight for this woman's honor, which is probably more than she ever did'
","This is notable in being the last Marx Brothers movie to feature Zeppo. It's actually kind of sad as I didn't even recognize him until near the end. Is this the best Marx brothers movie? I rank it second only to 'A Night At The Opera', like everyone else would. There's a few weaker moments which don't make it quite as good as that movie, but it's still awesome. It's actually weird seeing as how I don't really consider the famous mirror scene to be one of the film's best gags. I remember Mike Nelson saying that if he could riff with one deceased person, it would be Groucho Marx and I can see why.Nearly all of Groucho's jokes sound like riffs. Right when he makes his first appearance, he can't stop making jokes. I even love the very first scene which features ducks in an actual soup. I guess it gives some context to the movie's name. I thought it was completely random, but this actually was a phrase used back in those days. Groucho steals the show, but Chico and Harpo are hilarious as well. I could simply go on all day talking about the hilarious jokes made in this movie. In fact, I think I'll just spend the rest of my review doing just that.When someone says, 'I'll teach you to kick me!', Chico responds with, 'You don't need to teach me! I know how!'. Maybe the first great joke was the woman saying, 'I was with my husband until the very end' which Groucho responds with, 'I can see why he passed away'. Later, she says, 'I want you to meet a very charming lady'. Groucho says, 'It's about time'. One particularly long one was, '...may look like an idiot and sound like an idiot, but don't let that fool you. He really is an idiot'. Oh, and I was afraid they wouldn't show the actual war scene, but luckily they did! That's what a perfect movie does! ****",10,0,1,6 March 2017
Edward Scissorhands," My favorite Tim Burton movie
","Of all the horrendous 'Silent Night, Deadly Night' films I've had to watch this December, I'm so glad to be back to a truly wonderful film. I admit it is kind of a stretch to call this a Christmas movie. It is featured, but it's not very relevant to the plot. Still, it's in there and I wanted to see something good and boy was I rewarded! It's a great film for any occasion. What I was impressed by this movie was how it really wasn't that dark. Tim Burton was known for being dark in his movies but this one wasn't really that sinister.Okay, it gets worse near the end and it's not really a feel good movie, but I truly found myself rooting for the characters in this. Most of the people in this movie are in fact quite nice. The story is that a scientist created a human but died before he could give him hands leaving him with literal scissor hands. The flashback where it shows him dying is probably the best part of the movie. He was just about to give him normal hands but died at the last minute. For a good portion of the movie, people are rather accepting of Edward.The ending's pretty bittersweet but it doesn't have a hopeless atmosphere and for the most part, Edward learns how to use his scissor hands to adjust to society. I admit that the romance wasn't that well written. It's still great because honestly, everyone really does work hard to act realistic in this movie. As realistic as a movie about a guy with scissors for hands could be. It's not really far on the fantasy scale and often just tries to paint a picture of common American suburbia. It's a rather quaint movie with great performances by Johnny Depp and everyone else. ****",10,1,1,8 December 2017
Face_Off," Wow, this is fun!
","Looking back at the time period from 1996 to 2001, we had a lot of bad movies come out, but the ones that were good and really do hold up are all the more awesome. This is one of the greatest action movies I've ever seen. It's my favorite Nicolas Cage movie and my favorite John Travolta movie. I just love this film for how utterly entertaining it is in every way imaginable. It has tons of explosions and great action scene after great action scene. I guess the movie itself isn't very intelligent, but the thing is, there's so much effort put into it! I love these actors and characters. Travolta and Cage seem to be going absolutely bonkers in this movie with exaggerated facial expressions and yells everywhere. In a lesser film, that would be annoying but here it's just icing on the cake for the great scenery, camera angles, original ideas, and great backstories. I really do sincerely sympathize with these characters and I wanted them to get out okay! The pacing is just incredible. It's pretty long, but it's worth it just to see all this cool stuff go on and on.The emotions are amazingly strong in this. Every single actor is right there in the moment. They're doing everything they can to understand not just their characters, but each other's characters. The scene with the face transplant is seriously one of the most intense I have ever seen in any movie. Then there's the scene where Cage awakens with no face and we finally get to see him in the reflection. It's such a haunting scene. There's so much variety in all the action and I found myself rooting for these fun and wacky characters. True, a lot of it doesn't make sense, but it's enjoyable popcorn fun from start to finish. ****",10,4,6,19 March 2017
Dark City," Uh, RIP Gene Siskel
","I remember this movie as being Roger Ebert's favorite film of 1998, which was the last Top list that Gene Siskel joined him on. His favorite movie of 1998 was 'Babe: Pig In The City', by the way. While I didn't like it as much as him, I still thought it was great. Many people have noticed similarities between this film and 'The Matrix'. I wouldn't go so far as to say this was ripped off by 'The Matrix'. That might just be because they used the same sets!If it was okay for them to do that, then it was okay for them to use this plot. I don't think it's as good as 'The Matrix' because it seemed a little rushed. I wanted to see more of their world as something ordinary. It's still a fantastic looking film. We get great visuals from beginning to end and the Strangers are really awesome villains. I wanted to see outside of this world like I did in 'The Matrix'. ***1/2",9,1,1,2 August 2018
Captain America: Civil War," I loved it, but I didn't love it that much?
","People will probably be mad that I only gave this a 9/10, but come on, I still love this movie! Anyway, I was expecting this to be an adaptation of the 'Civil War' Marvel comics, but it really wasn't. It didn't feature much of the story elements, although I haven't officially read the series, so I can't judge. Let's hope Spider-Man doesn't end up making a deal with Mephisto. Speaking of which, Spider-Man is probably what attracted people the most to this movie. It's amazing to think that in only ten years, this character has been played by three different actors in three different continuities. It just seems a waste to not put 'The Amazing Spider-Man' series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now, of course this Spider-Man is better than that version.A lot of people were afraid that Spider-Man would just immediately appear, or would at least only be seen briefly. As someone who has seen Agents Of Shield or more importantly Agent Carter, it was great to see a connection to the TV shows with her funeral being held. It was weird how they didn't mention Nick Fury. At least Thor and the Hulk were mentioned. It's too bad that Thor did not appear as he happens to be my favorite Avenger. I admit to being confused as to why they were deemed too powerful to be in the movie. I mean, just put them on different sides, duh! I've complained way too much. What matters is that we get to see more development with Bucky, who probably shines here the most. He even set a record for longest time to resurrect a character in the comics, as it was forty years! It seemed downright insane, but it ended up making some great movies out of it. I love how these characters all have unique personalities. It's always great to see new developments featuring superheroes who have to deal with the consequences of their actions. The fights the characters have with each other make a lot more sense. We even get some great personal stuff with Iron Man. The action scenes are amazing with all these wonderfully bright characters taking part in these great fights.Black Panther is also introduced and really gets a great scene at the end. This movie may not have affected the status quo of the Avengers that much, but is definitely worth watching. ***1/2.",9,1,9,30 May 2016
Saw III," Uh...I liked it?
","This is the third in the 'Saw' series and honestly, I thought this was fairly good. There are two main plots going on, one where a man named Jeff is being tested and another where Jigsaw has kidnapped a surgeon to save her life. The parts with Jeff are easily the best, as we see it build up wonderfully. The movie ends by revealing that Jeff and the surgeon are actually husband and wife! Honestly, I really did think it was clever how they set up these two stories together. I had no idea Amanda would die.It really did make sense within the context of the story. I also appreciated how they really did raise a lot of moral questions that Jeff was going through. Yes, it's very gory and graphic, but I honestly think there was more to it than meets the eye. The most graphics bits are probably the surgery, but really, I found that kind of justified given that it was well, surgery. I've seen so many awful movies with a mass murderer leprechaun lately that I really did find this to be much better. I'm not into horror movies, but...please don't judge me, I was entertained, okay! ***",7,0,0,21 May 2018
Resident Evil," Better than I thought
","This really does seem like it was a movie intended for fans of the 'Resident Evil' game. I've seen some of the sequels and they're not as good. I'm not familiar with the games, but as far as I know, this was pretty faithful to them. There was, however this one major problem that kept me from liking it. The CGI was simply terrible! I'm sorry, but while the practical effects were fairly nice to look at, a lot of this movie was just plain ugly! Now, I know that it's not meant to be Shakespeare. It does seem a lot like a video game.I appreciate it when people are loyal to the fanbase. The pacing is this film is kind of on and off. It gets a bit too fast into it, but then again, a lot of the film is well put together. I actually do feel for some of these characters even though I'm not familiar with the games. I also like how this does set up a story that is used for more movies, even if they're not that great of a product. It probably helps that I'm into zombies. While I found it to be okay, the creators definitely tried. **1/2",6,2,2,8 February 2017
Avengers: Endgame," The longest superhero movie ever!
","Yep, this surpassed 'The Dark Knight Rises' for its length although I think the uncut version of 'Watchmen' might be even longer. Everyone was hyped to see this movie particularly with how the Avengers would defeat Thanos. They do it in the first 20 minutes, rather easily. People were also wondering how Ant-Man would be freed from the quantum realm. That happens immediately afterwards, and it's done accidentally by a rat. And we still have two and a half hours left!The basic plot is that Ant-Man tells everyone that time moves differently in the quantum realm and they can use this knowledge to get the Infinity Stones from the past. Turns out they can't actually change the past, so it's safe for them to do whatever they want, as long as they find the Stones. The time travel bit comes in exactly an hour long. I looked at my watch! They get the Stones and have to deal with Thanos from the past coming which happens exactly at the two hour mark. Dang, this was wonderfully paced!I think this is the last Avengers movie, even though there will be more movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I saw this for my 30th birthday and knew I had to see something that special for it. My mom was crying when all the superheroes came back at the end. It's very difficult to keep up the interest in a movie for over three hours and you have to be a movie as awesome as this to do that! Time travel's always a lot of fun and we get great interactions from all the characters as normal. If only we had a scene after the credits! ****",10,137,258,24 May 2019
Toy Story 4," They did it again!
","This is the best fourth installment I've ever seen in any series! I remember back when this very website said that there was a 'Toy Story 4', but then in the FAQ it was just said to be a hoax. I guess it was real after all! Many people were skeptic because 'Toy Story 3' was the perfect finale to the series. I knew they had to make a major change if they would make it as good as the other ones. I remember when the ending was coming and I said that I went the way, I would put this on the same pedestal as the previous ones.And guess what happened? The previous movie mentioned that Bo Peep had left, but they never showed how. They do in the first six minutes of this film! So the plot is that Bonnie literally makes a new toy out of a spork and googly eyes which turns out be a real toy! 'Sporky' can't understand his status as a toy and tries to leave the family when they're on a road trip. Turns out he more or less accepts that he's a toy in the first thirty minutes of the movie!Unfortunately, Woody and Sporky have to deal with a villain named Gabby, who wants to steal Woody's voicebox. Duke Kaboom (voiced by Keanu Reeves) doesn't appear until halfway through the movie. He ends up still being a great character! This movie has great joke after great joke and everything else great! It's great how they worked so hard to flesh out Bo Peep's characters. It's too bad that some of the voice cast had died, which is why they don't have that much of a role here (especially Mr. Potato Head with Don Rickles). ****",10,1,4,22 July 2019
1941," It tried?
","This is an epic comedy that has a lot of good points but unfortunately it's weighed down by how it doesn't really know what it wants to be. Is it a comedic film trying to be dramatic or a drama trying to be comedic? A lot of the content just seems off place here. It's hard to tell what's meant to be taken as a joke. There's some pretty weird slapstick in this movie. You'd think a film based on World War II wouldn't have the disclaimer that any similarities to real people would be included. Well, I guess the story is pure fiction.A lot of the characters just come off as mean in this. They just randomly have soldiers and sailors fight each other. The fights don' even make sense. Still, it's definitely a big nice looking film. It's great to see an all star cast of John Belushi, John Candy, Dan Aykroyd and Christopher Lee in this. They're not at their best, but these are all fine actors. I guess it might be worth it for a quick Christmas watch. There's a lot better and lot worse stuff out there. **1/2",6,0,2,2 December 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," The wait is finally over!
","I'm just going to say right now that I don't believe this movie to be as good as the 2012 Avengers movie. It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike 'Transformers' these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****",10,4,10,30 April 2018
Aladdin," Poor Iago
","There were a lot of good things about this movie and a lot of bad things. I guess it equals to everything being okay. The opening song 'One Jump Ahead' is easily the best part of the movie. They get some new characters or replacement characters and they're honestly quite good. The Genie gets a human love interest and it's resolved in a very clever manner. We get more insight on Jafar with how he wants to conquer other kingdoms.Now here's the negatives. Iago was one of the funniest characters in the original and he's waaay less entertaining here. I remember the awesome climax in the original with Jafar turning into a giant snake and the Genie rooting Aladdin on! Here, none of that happens. The pacing isn't that good as it's too spread out for a two hour movie and probably could have been the length of the original film. Well, those are the goods and bads for this movie! **1/2",6,0,1,11 June 2019
The Lion King," Will there be more live-action films will fully CGI characters?
","I had heard bad things about this movie, but in all honesty, I did enjoy it. It's true that the original is much better, but I really did feel the good outweighed the bad here. Unlike 'Aladdin', it doesn't add any new characters. It's mostly a faithful adaptation. The pacing was really good here, especially when you consider the movie's two hours long. I think the main problem with 'Alice In Wonderland' was that it changed too many things while this one should have had more changes, but I'd rather have it like that.The special effects are really impressive. There are still a lot of faults here and there. I did not care for the singing at all in this, especially how 'Be Prepared' was really disappointing. This had so little energy in it, especially considered that in the original voice actor Jeremy Irons actually strained his voice and had to be replaced with Jim Cummings! I know a lot of people hate this movie and that's fine. I thought the voice acting with John Oliver and Seth Rogen was great and it's worth watching if only because it's the list fully CGI live-action movie.",7,0,2,27 July 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," What it does right it does right
","This is the fifth entry in the long running 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' movie franchise and it isn't getting any better. There are definitely good things about this movie but at this point, there are so many of these movies, like 'Transformers' they aren't special and decline with age. Of course, they're still better than 'Transformers' hee hee. Anyway, this movie features Will Turner's son trying to find a magic trident that will undo the curse put upon Will Turner that caused him to become bound to the Flying Dutchman. I do like the idea of them trying to do something that's important to the story.The effects are very nice and it's always good to see Jack Sparrow. The problem is that the plot is far too simple and the villain is just lame. It's reached the point where we're just recycling old characters and we don't have any sense of finality or being in a new place. In a long running series, that can get annoying. Will and his wife were so great playing off of Jack but their absence in most of this movie just makes the film awkward. There's more action but certainly a sense of deja vu as it does seem we're just trying to throw everything in for a bigger movie. **",5,2,5,20 August 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," At least alright
","After the amazing 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past', we were all hyped about the next movie coming up featuring beloved villain Apocalypse. It was a tough act to follow, but it wouldn't have been that enjoyable either way. There are a lot of pros and cons, but the cons dominate here. What was weird about this movie was that it seems like Apocalypse didn't even do that much. I mean, he didn't talk a lot and he just sort of stood around a lot. We should have seen more of his origin and the exact point that he was created. He was older than Ancient Egypt. Also, why was this a prequel to the original movies? We already showed with 'X-Men: First Class' that a good prequel could be made.There's no point in placing this in the past. We even got another great movie taking place at this time which made more sense via time travel. Wolverine does in fact appear in this movie, but only briefly. Yeah, when you think about it, his presence is pretty pointless. It's like they were just trying to give him a brief cameo like Professor X in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. The weirdest part has to be this idiotic move Apocalypse does. In one scene, he actually has access to all the world's nuclear weapons and then he throws them all in the sky. Why doesn't he just, I don't know, USE THEM to kill people?! I guess one could argue that he didn't want to kill everyone and just rule over them, but that makes no sense. It's later shown that he does want to rebuild the Earth from the ruins he'll create. Why not just use those missiles to do it? It would have been the easiest thing to do. All they had to say was that Havoc severed the ties with Apocalypse so he couldn't fulfill his mission.There's one scene where the characters come out of watching 'Return Of The Jedi' and remark that they're sure the third one (this) was the worst. Is that meant to be a shot at itself? The third X-Men movie was considered by many people to be the worst, but most everyone agrees now that 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' was the worst. 'The Phantom Menace' was the fourth created, which again, could be a reference to the fourth X-Men movie. Ironically, this movie is now in between. I also saw 'Up The Academy' listed there, which could be another injoke as that movie was discredited by the people at MAD Magazine how the first Wolverine movie was.For all the flak I give this movie, it's still by no means really bad. It's great to see Quicksilver again and he is as entertaining as ever. Yeah, they do reuse a lot of jokes from his first appearance, but they still work pretty well. The scenes with Magneto are actually really well done. The best part in the whole movie is probably him seeing his daughter die and his reaction. These are really sincere scenes and they advance the story well. The visuals are really good in this. Still, it's too long and the last fight scene just seems to go on forever. Even the scene after the credits goes on forever! I do like the idea of them showing more of the characters and their fates. I say that while it's better than 'Batman Vs. Superman', it's nowhere near as good as 'Captain America: Civil War'. It's fine for a single watch, but nothing you'd want to return to. **1/2",6,1,6,20 June 2016
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Always original ideas
","For some reason, this is often credited as Miyazaki's first movie even though he was clearly billed as the director of 'The Castle Of Cagliostro' from 1979. For whatever the order, this is a wonderful film. I seriously think that this guy never had the same premise twice. This was apparently his attempt at a movie in a post apocalyptic world. Given the presence of giant insects and a giant resurrected body, I guess you could also consider this his try at a giant monster movie. For whatever he was trying, he got it right! The animation is as wonderful as ever. He's created such a beautiful world for us to look at, even though it does take place in a pretty dark world. I admit it was great to at least see that giant thing get at least two blasts at the giant insects at the end. I love these creatures. Even though it's not that relevant to the story, I like the fox-squirrel that appears. Seriously, it looks like an early pokemon. Wow, I wish this guy would work on the next pokemon movie! You get strong emotions and a nice environmental message which is rarely done well. ***1/2",9,1,2,4 May 2017
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not even for fans
","This is considered to be the worst movie in the 'Resident Evil' series and for mostly good reason. I admit that the only reason I was attracted to this movie was how it was on Roger Ebert's most hated movies list. I don't hate it as much as he did, but I still hated it. I have known seen every 'Resident Evil' movie. I'll at least give them props for being better than oh, 70% of video game movies, not that that says much. The movie's main fault is that it's just nothing but fight scene after fight scene.There's just absolutely nothing in this film that hasn't been done better in other zombie movies. Heck, there's nothing that the other films in the series hasn't done better. It's completely mindless violence with random shooting, which unfortunately could be interpreted as a faithful video game adaptation. We have in fact gotten better video game movies this year like 'Tomb Raider' and 'Rampage' which, while not masterpieces, at least treat their stories like actual stories. I'm not that familiar with the games, but I was able to recognize Jill Valentine at least. I do think Ebert went a bit too far when telling people not to let their kids date people who like this movie, considering that he was the only critic on RottenTomatoes that liked 'Speed 2: Cruise Control'. *1/2",4,0,4,18 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's pretty perfect
","This movie opens up with an awesome action scene that perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film. I remember a review saying that this was the funniest 'Star Wars' movie ever. I'd have to agree. It's funny how a lot of films that work great as serious movies have great funny moments too. They're intentionally funny. This movie actually does not pick up exactly where the previous one left off. We do in fact get the action sequence before Rey meets up with Luke. I knew Luke would just toss away his lightsaber. Anyway, it was pretty interesting to see Kylo Ren kill Snoke and then not turn to the good side. I guess the notion was that he wanted to become the new supreme leader. Snoke was provoking him a lot before. I admit Kyl Ren isn't the best of villains, not on the same level as Palpatine, but was portrayed quite well here.There's this awesome and funny scene where Luke survives being hit by every blast from the enemies. Granted, it's because he was just a hologram, but it's still a great scene. We get absolutely amazing music not to mention how beautiful this film looks. I especially love seeing all the little creatures that appear. The special effects work quite well and I loved how unpredictable it was. I knew it would be dedicated to Carrie Fisher. It's these reasons why I'm a 'Star Wars' fan. ****",10,6,35,26 December 2017
The Evil Dead," Holds up
","I ended up seeing 'Army Of Darkness' first and being blown away by how massive it is. I guess it's only because of that, that I am not giving this a higher score. The movie did take awhile to get really good. It's still pretty worth it when it really gets there. It's weird, because I thought this was going to be the movie that had the most iconic scenes like Ash losing his arm or everything in the room laughing. Yeah, I was a bit disappointed. Still, I definitely liked this movie.In terms of its reputation as one of the goriest films ever, it's nowhere near as bad as 'Caligula' or 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Maybe it didn't come off as too scary for me. It's still great to see these impressive sets and costumes hold up. The stop motion isn't bad, but I never really was into that. I still love the atmosphere that this film creates and how it really is ahead of its time in terms of character development and playing with the horror movie tropes. It's quite unpredictable and is worth your time if you're a horror movie fan. Yes, boo me for liking AOD more, but I still acknowledge this film as the launch of a genre. ***",8,0,1,21 August 2016
Clash of the Titans," Not the worst
","As usual, I feel bad for not having seen the original 'Clash Of The Titans' movie...or have I? I've just seen so many movies it's hard for me to even remember them all! Anyway, I didn't like this movie but it was really was at least better than I thought it would be. It's one of those leave your brain at the door films. That certainly doesn't make it good, but it's at least tolerable. This movie features Zeus' illegitimate son fighting the Kraken which Hades unleashes. I actually thought this was a really nice looking movie. The CGI is pretty impressive.There's a ton of fight scenes and they really aren't that bad. This is by no means a great movie, but if you're 'really' bored, I might recommend it. The worst part is probably at the end when Hades finally appears to fight and he's defeated almost instantly. Also, the dialogue is pretty tacky especially between Zeus and Hades. It's really not much that hasn't been done in much better films. It at least looks nice but it's nothing to praise or hate. **1/2",6,0,0,11 August 2017
Logan," Well that was different
","I personally didn't think this was the best of all the 'X-Men' movies, as for me that honor would go to either 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past' or 'X-Men: First Class'. This was still a wonderful movie and possibly my favorite of the year so far. What's amazing is that the film has relatively few characters but is still engaging. It's great to see not just Wolverine, but also Professor X star in this. Yeah, I admit that I don't like the idea of all the other mutants having died out, but we still got an awesome movie out of it. What I also love is how real this film is. Most of this is just a road trip movie. Yeah, not what you'd expect for a superhero movie.This is the first R-rated X-Men movie and it earns its rating. You should be warned. This is a lot more profane and violent than the other movies, so don't take your kids to see this one. There's still a great purpose with all the insanity going on. It's a bit too long, but the action scenes are mostly amazing. I thought the Wolverine clone was Sabretooth at first. I feel bad for not recognizing the X-23 kid from the comics. One awesome thing is how this movie actually features real X-Men comics. Yeah, X-23 reads them and Wolverine dismisses them as being fantasy. Well, they're still in fantasy, right? I have to tell you how this movie ends and a bit before that.Professor X dies and stays dead this time and so does Wolverine. Yes, they actually die and it shows them being buried. I thought I knew there'd be a brief scene where Wolverine is shown to come back right before the credits, but it never happens. Then I thought, oh, they're showing that after the credits. I think every 'X-Men' movie had a scene after the credits setting up a sequel. This one does not.Yes, Wolverine actually stays dead. Hugh Jackman has stated this will be the last 'X-Men' movie he'll be in. The 'X-Men' series has finally ended after 17 years of giving us such beloved movies. I truly am sad that this great franchise has ended. It's too bad we don't see the other characters in this, but it's still a great movie. Goodbye once and for all, Wolverine and thank you for giving us such great movies for all these years. ***1/2",9,3,7,19 March 2017
Hotel Transylvania," Best Adam Sandler movie!
","I'm skeptical to like anything by Adam Sandler, but my hope went up when I found that none other than Genndy Tartakovsky was directing this film. He was a big part of my childhood with cartoons like 'Dexter's Laboratory' and 'Samurai Jack'. Now, I know it's hard to make the transition to CGI, but he made it just fine. It's a pity that this movie didn't do too well with critics, although it still got a much higher score than most of Adam Sandler's movies. Tartakovsky is what makes this movie. What stands out as the best parts are probably how beautifully animated this film is. The colors are gorgeous and there's so much movement.I keep hearing there's lots of hidden things in this, but I didn't see most of them. I'm normally not a fan of celebrity voices, but it was done well here, especially considering the sheer number of bad movies of any kind these actors have been in. While I praise the film for being wacky, I really did get the emotional bits in it. There's lots of great jokes of course. I admit that some parts of it aren't that good. It's weird how they are so easily accepted into the human world. It's kind of a dues ex machina. I saw the second movie first and I think this one is better, but they're both enjoyable. ***",8,1,2,28 October 2016
Big Fish," My luck won't last forever
","I remember back when this movie first came out and I mostly forgot about it after awhile. I love this movie because it reminded me so much of 'Forrest Gump'. Both are movies that feature a guy telling his life story, about how he fell in love and got the girl he wanted, how he fought in a war, and the strange ways he affected other people's lives. Like 'Forrest Gump', the audiences like it more than the critics. I thought the title would be a metaphor for something. Instead, there really is a big fish featured in this movie!I didn't even recognize Ewan McGregor. He really is quite prolific. We get to see small bits from a lot of talented actors like Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi. Why is Steve Buscemi in everything I've been watching lately? The setup is that a dying man is telling his son the story of his life. His son tries to figure out how much of his story is true.What's interesting is that most of the people he talks about meeting do in fact appear in the movie at the end. We do, however, still get no confirmation of the supernatural stuff he mentioned, like trees coming to life. I watched this because it's the favorite movie of Nostalgia Critic cast member, Tamara Chambers! This is probably my favorite Tim Burton movie. I love how everything builds up on itself and is all relevant in the end. Don't forget this one! ****",10,0,1,30 April 2018
This Is Spinal Tap," Here's where the phrase started
","On TVTropes, I constantly heard the phrase 'Up To Eleven' being used. I even frequently used it myself when editing the website, even though I had never seen the movie. The funny thing is that even in the movie itself they make fun of this. It features the interviewer wondering why they don't just make ten louder. I didn't even recognize Harry Shearer in this. He's such a talented entertainer I have to acknowledge him.The funniest line is probably when they mention choking on vomit, but not his own vomit. The biggest appeal to this movie is probably how realistic it is. Spinal Tap isn't a real band, but they certainly seem like one here. With all the controversy and crazy things going on bands, it's great to have a piece of satire like this. Everyone acts like they are in a real documentary and while not as good as 'Borat', still a significant film. I'll ignore 'An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn!' over this. ***1/2",9,0,2,19 February 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Thus ends a uh, popular series
","I like most people am not a fan of 'Twilight' and there was never a movie in the series that I thought was genuinely good, although they did try a few times. This movie mostly suffers from really bad CGI. I mean, the wolves in this just look so terrible. I'm also pretty terrified by the baby who has this horrible looking CGI at first. At least it gets better when she's older. I can at least acknowledge that this were some people who liked this series and it does seem like it served its purpose with those people well. This was made into possibly the longest movie review in history with Spoony talking about this for over two and a half hours! I actually do like what they do at the very end. It looks like there's this big fight scene. This is probably the main criticism of the series in that Bella causes all these bad things to happen. They actually did do something unique and it ended up being better than I thought. The fight scene was actually an illusion or a vision of what would happen. Everyone ends up leaving in peace. Of course, it's still not a good movie. It's a shame how the actual actors hate it more than even most people. I think this was the only 'Twilight' movie that didn't win Best Picture at the MTV Movie Awards. I guess people learned their lesson by this. It was at least interesting to see how a series ended.I still enjoy it when people make fun of these movies, even if I don't find them awful. Granted, I still think they're mostly bad. They actually did get some interesting shots in and they even had some interesting powers that the various vampires showed off. It did entertain me with how cheesy it was at times, so I'll give it that. These actors need to show more emotion. Hopefully, they'll move on to better roles. I don't find most of these movies that harmful, but now that they're done, we can just ignore them like we should with most movies we don't like. There will be worse and much better movie series out there. **1/2",6,0,1,30 December 2016
3 Idiots," All is well indeed
","This was, for awhile, the highest grossing movie in India. Seeing as how India makes twice as many movies as us (we're still at least in the Top 3 though), it really is something most people should watch. The basic story is that these two students are going on a road trip to find their friend, Rancho. As a three hour long comedy, it knows how to use its time. Of course, this can be said for most Bollywood films. For whatever reason, the version I saw occasionally had English in it.What's great about this movie is that so much is going on and they know how to experiment with so many different genres. We get great comedy, drama, and romance. You could even argue it gets scary near the end. It's a plot that goes everywhere and you're having fun every minute of the day. It's one of those movies where you have to pay close attention. Nearly every joke is alluded to or referenced again in the story. Maybe it can focus too much on drama, but working in different genres is always impressive. We even get some great lessons learned about serving our parents and how important college degrees can be. It helps that it's so much fun and we're glad to see standard Bollywood dance numbers. It's quite bright and colorful. I love the bits with the pencils in space too. Glad to know this has enough votes to be on the Top 250. ****",10,0,2,15 September 2018
A Clockwork Orange," Great movie
","'A Clockwork Orange' tells the story of a criminal named Alex and is composed of three parts. The first part features him and his followers committing crimes while the second features him being forced to be good and the third features him trying to adapt back in the real world. There are so many things that make this a wonderful film. The first that comes to mind is the music. No, not the Beethoven music played (although that's great too) but the music played in the more intense scenes. This is a great movie, but it is rather obscene.It can be hard to understand the message of the story, but it is truly a powerful one. Alex is depicted as a sadist who is tortured to become an ordinary person. The film's main moral is that no matter how evil someone is, they shouldn't be forced to be rehabilitated. Alex even comes off as quite sympathetic in this movie. I guess most of the characters in this film are evil to a certain extent. I feel bad for Alex as he meets more conflict trying to readjust to society.What's also so great is the imagery, especially at the beginning. I love seeing all these strange statues that set the mood for the rest of the film. I am so glad to finally see such a high rated movie on this website. The scene where Alex's eyes are forced open is among the most powerful and disturbing scenes in cinema history. The pacing with the three parts is fantastic and in a long film, that's always a big plus. It's great to see a film that has been homage so many times. The title refers to how an orange (something colorful) is worthless if it's done by clockwork (being forced to) just like a man in this scenario. ****",10,1,1,4 January 2018
The Fly," Oh, I was afraid alright
","This is a great horror movie but it's probably not for the faint of heart. The real scene stealer here is probably the practical effects. As insane as this movie gets, I really do feel for the characters involved. I had sadly already seen the ending so I knew how it ended, but I watched it again because it's the best part of the movie. This is probably Jeff Goldblum's best film. I like it even more than 'Jurassic Park'.My only complaint is that I wish it was longer. I feel like they could have shown us more of Goldblum going insane. The music is great and it's full of moments to make you jump out of your seat. I think most people probably already know the plot. It's about a scientist who uses a teleportation device not knowing a fly was with him, causing his DNA to merge and turn into a giant fly. They say the original film from the 1950's was scary for its time and those who were frightened by that certainly don't want to watch this. ***1/2",9,2,4,26 February 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Of course it holds up
","This movie was Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut and is considered to be one of the best directorial debuts ever. You could tell he was destined for greatness. It's also easy to say that this was Steve Buscemi's best role. Like his later film 'Pulp Fiction', it's told in an nonlinear form of storytelling. The final scene is still the final scene unlike that movie. The best scene is probably at the beginning with the tipping argument.Mr. Blonde is a complete sadist, yet he thinks it's immoral to not tip waitresses. I had seen bits and pieces of this movie before. It's certainly great, but not uh, one of the best movies ever made? I always want to see films in the Top 250. This movie tells the story of a diamond heist gone wrong. One of the six men involved is believed to be a snitch, but I won't spoil the rest of it. ***1/2",9,1,2,16 April 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Mostly deserving of its popularity
","It's weird how this has a high rating yet some of the most popular reviews on this website are of the negative kind. I guess the Walker brothers were on to something. I was quite impressed at how loyal it was to the original Disney movie. I guess it's hard to consider this a live-action version of a cartoon when it's simply a fairy tale that most people are familiar with. If it is one, it's easily one of the best ever made. I was mostly impressed by how beautiful this film looks. The CGI is really good in this. I especially love how they make the objects just come alive.My favorite part in this movie is my favorite part from the original movie. It's where the house objects fight the angry mob. I'm just so impressed at them actually winning. There is one thing that really bothers me. This film was advertised as having the first openly gay Disney character, even though LaFour only dances with a man for a few seconds. This was done better in the last episode of 'Gravity Falls' much better with the sheriff and deputy. Still, this is a good movie with great atmosphere with really good pacing, not easy for a longer movie. Thanks for including the classic songs from the original. ***",8,5,8,16 April 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Not as good as the first, but still awesome
","Watching this movie, I felt it was great to have these wonderful characters again and it was even better than I thought it would be! It's probably because it's a movie that just keeps getting better and better. It was weird because I'm so familiar with Marvel Comics given that I've read a lot of the Marvel Encyclopedia. I still find all these new characters I hadn't heard of! The best part is probably always getting introduced to characters that are all relevant to the story with distinct personalities.It seems like it's become standard to mock the Transformers movies when looking at great action films. Okay, they're making like a dozen of those so it's justified. It was not just a rehash of the original film, but instead a great look at the true origin of the main character. I was somewhat familiar with Ego, but I can't really tell if this is a faithful representation of the character from the comics. The best scene is probably the one with the arrow just hacking through all these guys. The film just looks gorgeous.It's incredible how we manage to just feast our eyes on these beautiful colors. Everything is so wonderfully detailed and it never comes off as gaudy. The characters are probably even funnier this time around. There's too many memorable lines to count. I love the conversation about how Groot hates hats and how Manti is still beautiful on the inside. One laugh out loud moment was when Gamora said she could just kill him if he (Ego) was evil. Turns out, they do! ****",10,1,6,27 May 2017
Castle in the Sky," My 300th movie!
","As someone who loves great films, I felt bad about not having seen most of Miyazaki's masterpieces. I have yet to see any of them that I would give a score lower than three and a half stars and this is no exception as it's easily a four star movie. I really do think it's great that this film uses both celebrity voices and voice actors, as well as Mark Hamill who's actually both! The animation may not be as good as 'Spirited Away', but it's still gorgeous to look at. I have been watching one movie a day since last December and decided to view this as my 300th movie overall.It's because I bought a fairly expensive copy of it. I had heard this set a record for most Tweets about a single subject or something like that. Whatever the record, this was great to watch. It was actually pretty rare that Miyazaki movies had a story with an actual villain in it. They rarely have black and white morality. This film, however, was a great exception and I admit to liking the idea of a more traditional story from him. I've also never seen anything from him that was an outright action movie. Yes, this had great drama, but it certainly had tons of action and explosions! I guess it's kind of weird being a fan of traditional anime like 'Dragonball Z', but this appears to obviously be something more cultured. I just think they're both great in their own way and their genres well. I guess this is the closest Miyazaki ever came to a typical action movie. Needless to say, it still has the great emotion that makes his film a masterpiece. The characters are still pretty morally ambiguous. The air pirates seem evil at first, but you definitely lighten up to them as time goes on. It was great to recognize Jim Cummings' voice, especially since I actually met the guy at a con! I love the designs of the robots. I was really impressed at how bad I felt for the original one. Robots are common in anime, but this was a truly emotional take on them. I really did feel sorry for this poor guy as he kept getting injured trying to help Sheeta. You briefly see some magic creatures that almost look like pokemon. It's great to see how such a great artist influenced all kinds of different anime. It takes a little while to get really good, but it's still flawless. This is for kids, adults, and anyone. ****",10,4,4,30 September 2016
Sausage Party," More than just cartoon characters swearing
","This movie was advertised as the first R-rated CGI movie. It wasn't done quite as blatantly as something like 'Fritz The Cat', the first X-rated cartoon period. I was hoping they might toss in some reference to that, but they didn't. It's probably just as well, as this film is enjoyable in its own right. It did set a new world record for most swearing in an animated movie beating out 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut'. I seriously wonder if Trey Parker and Matt Stone want Jonah Hill to die. A few people who worked on the film were actually mad they weren't in the credits. No wonder there was so much swearing.The biggest appeal for this was that it was an anticipated movie not based on anything or a sequel or remake. The door IS in fact left open for a sequel, albeit in the strangest way possible. What you appreciate about this film is that the animation really IS very well done. I couldn't help but be reminded of one of my favorite shows 'The Amazing World Of Gumball', another cartoon version of talking objects. It seems like every cartoon nowadays has talking inanimate objects and/or lesbians. Yep, this has both! I knew they'd do the obvious joke of the taco being one.What's good about the movie is that a lot of creative ideas are really put out well. We see the different kinds of food and personalities and how they interact with the world. This is a movie that does all it can with its creativity. Now, I will admit that I don't like the ending that much. It features the food fighting and killing the humans. The thing is, the humans were just trying to eat food. I mean, that's what ALL living organisms must do in order to survive. Are humans just supposed to starve to death in this movie's universe? It seems like they could have resolved it better, with some compromise. Still, this is a movie worth your time. ***",8,4,8,9 September 2016
Joker," Body count: 10
","I am just amazed at how this only 69% of critics liked it, but it has a 9.0 here! I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called 'THE Joker'. The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in 'The Dark Knight', but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2",9,11,21,11 October 2019
A Hard Day's Night," So feel good
","What I love about this movie is how authentic it is. I remember reading Roger Ebert's review of it and how interesting it was to learn that he was born on the same day as Paul McCartney! Anyway, what's amazing is how utterly realistic this movie is. It really does seem like a documentary. Most of this movie is just hanging out with the Beatles and them cracking some jokes and being interviewed. We of course get all their greatest songs.You could simply listen to those at day. It's such a relief to watch a good movie after being subjected to all these stupid films I've seen lately. It's funny how they're listed in the credits not as themselves, but as uh, themselves. Anyway, this is a really soft moving film. At first, I thought I would be mad that it was too short but instead the running time made it perfect. I guess you could call me a Beatles fan even if I'm not the biggest one.To a certain extent, this does seem like a really long music video. It does have a steady plot and it makes you feel like you're right there in on the action. It's hard to even believe that these people are acting. Well, they are playing themselves so it's technically not acting. There's tons of quotable dialogue and I especially like, 'It's an in-joke!'. A must for any music fan or really anyone. ****",10,0,1,3 February 2018
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Probably my favorite Dracula movie
","Being someone who reads (or read) a lot, I feel bad about not having read the original Dracula novel. It makes it hard for me to determine whether or not certain films are direct retellings of the original or completely new stories. As I've seen the famous Bela Lugosi version, this seemed to follow the same plot as that one. Of course, when you have something as big as Dracula, you can't help but know a bit of the story. This is most likely the best Dracula movie I've ever seen. I remember how the hairdo was parodied in a 'Treehouse Of Horror' episode of 'The Simpsons'. It's a shame that just disappears thirty-six minutes into the movie.I had no idea Anthony Hopkins was in this movie and boy, does he do an amazing job! I loved him as Van Helsing and appreciated how all of these characters had such unique personalities. I didn't even recognize Keanu Reeves! It's great to have so many beloved actors in a movie. I was surprised at how sexual and bloody this film was. It really does seem like a whole new take on Dracula. The first five minutes are the best as it actually explains his origin. It's a short scene, but dang, is it poetic. I thought this would be longer, but I think the length was perfect. I just love the atmosphere, the bright colors, the costumes, it's a wonderful film. ***1/2",9,2,3,5 January 2017
It Chapter Two," Body count: 8
","This is a pretty long awaited film as the original was ranked as one of the best Stephen King movies ever. I agree and thought this movie was pretty good. The plot's pretty basic, with the Losers being reunited as adults to fight Pennywise. They have to perform this ritual where they sacrifice tokens. I will admit that the movie probably is too long. It's the longest horror movie I've ever seen!The characters are still pretty likeable. Richie's my favorite and I could have sworn that was Dana Gould playing him. I liked seeing their future careers as I could totally see them doing those kinds of things as adults. The problem is that I just like the kid actors a lot better. I guess it's good we got to see them again for a long time! It's a nice message about nostalgia. ***",7,0,0,21 September 2019
Finding Dory," Even better than the first one
","In 2003, 'Finding Nemo' became a legendary film as it would soon become the best selling DVD of all time! That would be a tough act to follow, right? Luckily, they made a sequel just as awesome. I am so glad that Pixar is more like 'Inside Out' this time instead of 'The Good Dinosaur'. Interestingly enough, the movie isn't really about finding Dory, but about finding Dory's parents. It helps that this is probably the best animation that Pixar has ever given us. I was afraid that this movie was going to just be a reprise of the original. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it really did use all new stuff.The best part is how I really felt for Dory in this. I wanted her to be happy! I wanted her to find her parents! We get a few other characters from the first movie, but only in cameos. It helps that there are tons of funny moments and great new characters. Even the credits build up to the rising of the surface. In the first movie, it seemed to show the humans as villains. I found this to be an improvement as it instead showed the humans as sincerely wanting to help the fish. It just wasn't quite in the right way. I'm really tired of PETA's influence. All the characters are lots of fun, but Dory herself truly steals the show, as expected. It was just a movie where you had to see what would happen next. You want it to go on as long as possible but not to the point where they would run out of ideas. And they don't! ****",10,8,27,9 July 2016
Halloween," Best slasher movie ever
","I'm not into slasher movies much and this is probably the only one I'll ever see in my entire life that I'll give a rating higher than an 8/10 or ***. What makes this movie so great is of course the atmosphere. I could have sworn that I heard this music being credited to 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'. Well, maybe that person was wrong. My favorite scene is probably at the very beginning where Michael commits his first kill. It's taken from his perspective and then it goes out and shows him as a kid without his mask. You'd think that would be something they'd work hard to hide.In fact, there are many glimpses of him without his mask and a rather clear one at the end. This might sound funny, but I'm really impressed at how Michael drives a car. In so many of these movies, the killer just randomly appears everywhere and seems to be able to teleport. They actually give a justification for this and make the killer intelligent. The fact that he just exists in the background in many scenes works out great too. They don't just focus on him and instead try to give real development to the side characters, always admirable. ***1/2",9,0,1,2 October 2017
Wonder Woman," Best movie of the year
","You know, I really did misjudge the DC Cinematic Universe. When 'Man Of Steel' came out, I thought it was just alright. I knew 'Batman Vs. Superman' would be a disappointment and didn't have high hopes for 'Suicide Squad'. I had little faith in this movie and boy, was I wrong. Is there some way to spell a clap in this review? I became quite familiar with the Wonder Woman mythos upon watching the 2009 direct to video film and I knew this movie couldn't be better than it. And you know what? I stand by that opinion. This still isn't as good as that movie.Ever since the first female superhero movie came out in 1984 with 'Supergirl' we've had nothing but bombs with these characters for over thirty years. Having come fresh from Superhero Month, I am so glad to have seen this. It was worth the price. I was always myself confused as to how there was never a theatrically released Wonder Woman movie and I guess they just needed all the time they could take with this true masterpiece. This movie features Wonder Woman, although she's never referred to that, only as Diana. I guess 'Princess Diana' is an awkward title now.At first, I thought this film took place in World War II given how that's when nearly all war films took place. Instead, it was World War I and I thank the creators for the variety. The movie's plot is that a pilot named Steve has crash landed on Wonder Woman's island, but is followed by Germans as he was a spy trying to infiltrate them. We get the first great fight sequence with the Amazons fighting the Germans. It's easy to recognize the main villain Ares, whom she believes to be the source of the conflict.Steve on the other hand, finds this silly and thinks that all of this conflict is caused by the true spirit of mankind. In the end, it turns out they're BOTH right. Ares is indeed among the Germans, but he insists that he just aided the humans and it's their doing that the world is at war. This film has absolutely fantastic battle sequences with such strong willed characters. It takes chances, as we actually see Steve pull off a heroic sacrifice in the end and he stays dead. Yeah, I wanted to see them together but this is made all the more effective.I kept thinking that Batman or Superman was going to show up some time in this movie. Maybe with the Flash time traveling, they would have cameos or at least the Flash himself would. This is what bothered me about the other movies. They just had these random cameos to try to promote other movies. I am so happy this has none of that and is simply a movie featuring Wonder Woman. Zack Synder really impressed me and it's so easy to say that is his best work because it is. This is better than all other female superhero movies combined and is something everyone can and should watch. Thanks for the hope. ****",10,6,17,10 June 2017
Carrie," Another great Stephen King movie
","I thought that I knew exactly how this movie ended, but it turns out I was wrong. I'm actually glad of it so the ending wasn't quite spoiled for me. Everyone remembers the ending of the film or rather one of the last scenes in the movie. This is a great movie throughout the entire running time. Even in the first scenes, we see Carrie struggle with puberty. We're not sure how many people die in the end. The last scene is truly haunting.The best performance might be Carrie's mother. From a certain point of view, her reaction to her daughter's telekinesis could be considered realistic given her personality. I heard that the actress who played her mother thought that she was in a comedy. She even holds that view up to this day. You feel sorry for Carrie and the few people who sincerely care about her. This is a great horror film. ***1/2",9,1,1,7 January 2018
The Iron Giant," It lived up to my expectations
","I had heard many great things about this movie over the years like how it was one of the best non-Disney animated movies ever made. Actually, creator Brad Bird did in fact go on to work for Disney (or more specifically Pixar), but it's still a Warner Bros. movie. It's great to have this little gem around and I'm so glad that it seems to be getting more popular all the time. Originally, it was thought to be obscure, but now it's praised for being the great film that it is. I admit that there are some things that could have been done better. We never do find out where the Iron Giant came from.I guess the implication is that he was from another planet. Was he supposed to be used as a weapon by aliens invading Earth? If so, that means things are going to get a lot worse now. I do believe it's said he's from a planet already destroyed or something. What I love about this film is the pacing. Nothing feels rushed. It's hard to do that with a movie less than 90 minutes long. It's a little clichéd at times, but it's still a great movie. The plot is fairly simple. It's about a robot that crash lands on Earth and befriends a little boy. I guess it's like ET only with a giant robot.The best part of this movie is easily at the end. It's when the Giant sacrifices himself to stop a missile from blowing up a town. I certainly felt chills when I saw that. I was thinking it would end when the military showed up, but I still got the big climax at the end. We even get a setup for a sequel, more or less as we actually see the Giant having his parts come back together at the very end. I guess it's all open to interpretation what happens next. By the way, the idea of his body parts coming back together is freaking amazing. We get characters that act like real people. I also love the 1950's setting. It's as good as people make it out to be. ***1/2",9,0,1,26 January 2017
Vanilla Sky," It should've been shorter
","It looks like we have another case where the people liked it more than the critics. I guess I'm probably on neither side and I'm just going to say that this movie was okay. There was one thing that I really felt weighed it down. It was too long. There was a time where he took off his mask that I seriously thought the movie would end there. Instead, it kept going! This was a DVD given by a friend for a birthday present. This may be the last movie I ever watch before getting a Netflix account. This movie was perfectly passable. I admit that it got a little predictable. I knew it was going to be that there were dreams involved.It was probably for the best I had no clue what this movie was about. It features Tom Cruise's character as a rich guy who finds a girlfriend and then his ex tries to kill him. Yeah, I didn't see that coming. He survives, but is left disfigured and tries to adjust to life this way. It wasn't that hard to follow but it certainly got weirder as it went on. The acting is pretty good, but I guess it's just not quite the movie for me. I guess it might be because I just saw the 'Agents Of Shield' episode 'Self Control' that I saw a much better story of people in a dreamlike state. **1/2",6,0,2,22 February 2017
Black Panther," Not that well known of a character
","I admit to not knowing much about the Black Panther, but I have read some comics with him in it. The only things I knew was that his real name was T'Challa and he came from the fictional country of Wakanda, a technologically advanced place with a policy of isolation. That's really all you have to know to enjoy this movie! This movie really downplays the superhero aspect. It's a lot more about this country deciding whether or not it should release its technology to the rest of the world.The end credits assure us that the Black Panther will be in the next Avengers movie. This movie is simply beautiful to look at. Every time we get a good look at Wakanda's world, it's a visual delight. It really downplays the aspect of it being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . I really thought that was something new and different for these creators. We get great action scenes and enough interesting things to keep any newcomer intrigued. ***1/2",9,5,19,18 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not terrible, but the bad outweighs the good
","Wow, Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Wonder Woman, Doomsday, Gotham, and kryptonite all in one movie! What more could you ask for? Well, for one, a better story. This film was mediocre at best. There are just too many faults to not take notice. First of all, this movie is way too long at two and a half hours. The pacing in this film is quite poor, seeing as how it's hard to tell when the real action begins. It just seemed like they were trying to put in too much and it just ended up being messy. One flaw is Doomsday appearing at all. The fact that they use the villain who killed Superman in one of the first movies shows how little these people know about pacing.In contrast, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is really taking its time with Thanos. Speaking of Doomsday, the CGI on film looks really bad. Not to mention the fact that the actual title fight with Batman and Superman seems too short, especially in a movie this long! It doesn't really deliver the goods and isn't rewarding. The final battle with Doomsday, while not great, is at least much more interesting. I also have to say that Jesse Eisenberg is bad as Lex Luthor. He just isn't fun and doesn't know how to use the character's full capacity. This is one of the most recognizable supervillians in existence! This technically isn't the first theatrical released depiction of Wonder Woman. I believe she was in 'The Lego Movie'. She was much better represented there! It tries too hard to be serious, although they did get some amusing lines toward the end. I will admit that I do like how they want to continue going on with this universe even though it's legions behind the Avengers. I knew that this was going to be bad. Why? Because 'The Force Awakens' was good! We're not that lucky! We needed to have a whole movie devoted to the new Batman. His backstory really seemed rush and there wasn't much buildup. He just came off as pretty boring in this. I feel bad for Ben Affleck, who was previously disappointed with his own work in 'Daredevil' and who is in fact himself a fan of superheroes. A pity he can't represent them well. There are so many better movies out there this year and this is a film that truly bites off more than it can chew. 'Man Of Steel' wasn't good for me, but at least tried to have an origin story. **",5,2,6,5 June 2016
Blade Runner," ...uh...?
","Wow, that was one of the most insane movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Luckily, I'm the guy who absolutely loves stuff like that. What I found weird about this was how there were all these unrelated stories being shown one after another. It was indeed great to see them all connect at the end. It was just hard to keep up with how they kept changing from one to the next. Anyway, this was still an absolutely wonderful film. It's mostly because it's such a beautiful looking movie. I simply can't believe this was made in 1982. I mean with these great visuals, it looks more like it was made in the 2000s! They mention 2017 as a date at one point and it's weird to be reviewing this in that year. My dad was right. This really was a movie that just puts you in a whole new world. It's hard to comprehend what's going on because everything is just so ridiculous. It's pretty easy to say it was dreamlike. I mean, this literally seems like a dream I would have. I guess dreams are something we can all relate to. It was about as easy to follow as one! I thought that it would be like an overblown action movie at first. Instead, there wasn't that much action and it instead just let its beautiful sets tell the story.I really do feel myself sympathizing and caring for the characters even though it was really hard for me to follow. I am so glad that there was an opening scene that told us all that was going on. I'll never get over how wonderful this movie looks for being made in the early 1980's. I guess this was just a thing for Harrison Ford back then as it was the same time the original 'Star Wars' movies were made. While this wasn't as good as those, it was just a visual masterpiece you couldn't help but get lost in its world. The pacing is just amazing, with so much being set up at the right time. Please watch this! ****",10,3,5,14 February 2017
A Night at the Roxbury," Loved the music
","I had never even heard of the 'Saturday Night Live' skit this was based on. All I knew about this was the massive amount of buzz it created as a meme on YTMND. I honestly think it set a record for biggest meme on that entire website. I admit to not knowing really why, because the movie's mediocre at best. This movie features two brothers who try to get in at a nightclub called the Roxbury. Actually, only half of the movie is that.The other half is them trying to get girls. It's pretty clichÃ©d, especially with how it's about two guys who split up and have to get back together. I kept thinking Jim Carrey was involved in this somehow. Apparently, he WAS, but it was only uncredited as a writer. Some jokes are good, but for the most part, it's pretty forgettable. Again, the music is amazing. **",5,2,2,10 March 2018
A Nightmare on Elm Street," It's good for me
","Freddy Krueger is back...oh wait, this was actually the first movie in the series. I did in fact watch the 2010 remake and recognized it for the crapfest it was. This movie is superior in nearly every way even though I'm not a fan of slasher movies. Freddy was notable in being the first slasher villain who talked so this really was something innovative at the time. Come to think of it, has any slasher movie remained silent since his introduction? Chucky, Pinhead, the leprechaun, they all talk and came out later. I think a weakness is that Freddy isn't on screen that much.He actually doesn't talk that much in this movie which is probably for the better. He appears as genuinely scary in this. We actually do get some pretty good character development for everyone else. That's probably because this movie has a fairly low body count and we're not just given the sense of developing doomed characters like the lesser 'Friday The 13th' movies. Hey, this had 'Home Alone' antics before 'Home Alone'! It's interesting to learn about the series mythology even though it isn't all explored here. ***",8,1,2,7 October 2017
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Most triumphant!
","I admit that the main thing that drew me to this movie was how I've been searching for the Most Triumphant Examples for many things and I wanted to know where the term came from. There's something that really impressed me about this movie. When it showed them going back in time, I thought they'd just have the foreign characters speak English. It wouldn't make sense, but that's what everyone really does. Instead, they did all speak their languages, so the movie's creators really did work hard on this! Dang, Keanu Reeves looks young.This might be the movie I've seen that had the most screen time of George Carlin. And yes, it probably is the best movie he was in. I really did find myself rooting for Bill and Ted in this movie, especially in the end when they did the oral exam. I mean, it really is a sincere series of scenes. It was great how everything fit together so well. Some of the jokes could be better, but it's still quite fun. ***",8,3,5,12 April 2018
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Best comedy ever? Pretty much, yeah
","I was fascinated into seeing this movie if only because of the sheer number of times it was quoted. I think it's somewhere between 'The Princess Bride' (my favorite movie) and 'Star Wars' in terms of the most terms that came from it. It's appropriately mentioned in Weird Al Yankovic's 'White And Nerdy' and I remember kids in school talking about it. The weirdest thing is that I saw so many clips of this movie online that I had practically come close to seeing the whole thing. And you know what? Even with all those clips seen, this still was something I could not pass a single second of.What else is there to say about it? Every joke is just timed fantastically. It is a film which has withstood the test of time. I'm fairly certain it's the highest rated comedy on the entire Internet Movie Database. I still think it ranks second to 'Airplane!' in terms of how funny it is. You can't get enough of this film. What's amazing is that every single joke just builds upon itself over and over until it finally finishes. This certainly seemed like a long film, if only because they were able to cram so many hilarious moments in this. You really have to think to get everything. This would have been the first movie to have a scene after the credits (the first is 'The Muppet Movie'), but it's just music where the credits should be. That's because the people making the credits were fired! Every single line is quotable. You have to pay attention to every little detail. Even if you've heard tons of quotes and scenes from this movie, you STILL have to see the whole thing to truly get the experience. Every single character in this movie is unforgettable. It's not just the Black Knight. You don't miss him because there's so many other one scene characters that are so wonderful. It's a film that truly reflects what you're thinking. In this one scene, I remember thinking that it was kind of pointless. Then the woman turned to me and asked if it should have been kept in. She read my frigging mind! I simply can not believe that Leonard Maltin gave this movie two and a half stars. How can anyone not like this?! Just when you think they've stopped with a certain joke, they pummel in more and more in a funnier manner.I lost count of how many times that one guy tried to sing. He DID eventually sing, but we didn't get to see it. Everything just escalates in the most wonderful way possible and it does manage to have a coherent story. I'm not the biggest 'Monty Python' fan, but you can call me one after watching this. It's so wonderful description can't do it any justice. I remember seeing the subtitles and thought there was something wrong with my DVD. I had to order this film from the library but it was really, really worth it. Watch this forever. 10/10 or **** or whatever.",10,0,1,3 May 2016
Incredibles 2," Yeah, one of the best sequels ever made
","I gave this movie the highest rating because of one thing. This film's main plot is that the Incredible family are trying to make superheroes legal again by having the mother Elasti-girl carry out missions. There turns out to be another villain known as the Screenslaver about. The meeting to legalize superheroes is arranged by this one guy. My dad and I just knew that he was the Screenslaver. Then it turns out...it's actually his sister! We seriously did not see that coming! Okay, I admit that by this point it has gotten kind of clichÃ© to have the villain in a Disney or Pixar film be a twist. Still, this was at least done better than most examples. Anyway, I thought this was even better than the original. It's great to have all these great characters back in a sequel that truly does advance their mythology. It even starts out as an immediate sequel to the first movie.There's even this great opening credits gag done in the style of the show. What many people might not know is that Elasti-girl was also the name of a DC Comics character, but Pixar explicitly got permission to use the name. Don't worry, Disney will probably eventually own DC as well. It's great to see the more mundane scenes with Mr. Incredible and his family. It really does make the film realistic. Just when you think Edna won't appear, she does! ****",10,1,7,17 June 2018
The Nice Guys," Best movie for Comedy Month
","In this age where every modern movie is a sequel or based on something else, it's great that we have a look at something brand new. This is one of the best comedies in recent years and everyone seems to agree with me. I'm reminded of what made films like 'Hot Shots: Part Deux' so funny was because the main characters play the goofy series straight. That's exactly what Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling do here. We get our first great joke of the movie when a car crashes through a house. What's great is that there's so much going on in this movie.You just have no idea what will show up next. The one moment that really made me jump in my seat was when a giant bee appeared in the backseat! It's a dream, by the way. There's all sorts of jokes used here, although slapstick comes off as the most prominent. The weird thing is that I saw the first half of this movie on an airplane. I was watching this weird edited version for some reason. Why would a movie shown on an airplane screen be edited? You're the only one who hears it! The few moments where the characters yell are especially funny because they're usually so calm. It's hard to make a good comedy two hours long, but they have enough jokes to support the whole running time. I wish this movie had become as popular as something like 'Borat'. It might just be the funniest film of this entire decade. ****",10,0,1,24 June 2018
Warcraft," Harmless
","I feel bad for watching and reviewing this, as I am not a fan of 'World Of Warcraft'. Then again, this is based by name on 'Warcraft' which isn't quite the same thing. All I can say is that this movie was just okay. From what I have seen of the Warcraft games, this seems to be quite loyal to them. I especially appreciate how good the CGI is. There are some moments where it's off, but for the most part, it's a pretty good effect. I guess it does have the feel of the actual game. I just wish I was more familiar with it. I don't want to have to go through all the trouble of getting an account to understand this, as I know how complicated this game is.I do recommend this to people who are Warcraft fans. The acting isn't bad at all, although there are some pretty badly done scenes. I actually like the Garona character and think she has some pretty good moments. There's even a nice little scene at the very end of the movie. This is a lesser film for me this year, but maybe that's because I've seen so many great movies. I am in no way trying to offend players of the game. It just doesn't seem like a movie made for me, but I didn't find anything terrible in it. **1/2",6,0,2,17 July 2016
Princess Mononoke," Best one this month!
","Okay, I've changed my mind and my favorite movie for Anime Month is this one. It's pretty easy to imagine that a Miyazaki film would be my favorite for anime. What's really great is how gorgeously beautiful the animation is. Even when you get used to Miyazaki's artwork, you just still never stop being amazed at how beautiful it is. I remember reading a review of 'Pokémon 4Ever' saying that it's obvious that director saw this movie. Yeah, it's very easy to see that as a ripoff to this movie. I mean, we feature a forest spirit and a lake that heals people and a character being absorbed into a monster.Wow, did they really think they could make something good out of a Miyazaki ripoff? Anyway, this actual movie is amazing. I heard that Miyazaki was good at romance, but honestly, I don't see that much romance in this or his other works. Still, it's a wonderful movie. One of the best parts is near the end, because of how realistic it is. It features the title Princess saying that she still doesn't trust humans but the main character is welcome to visit her in the forest while he goes back to the human world.The destroyed city is going to be rebuilt and I guess it's implied they're going to be better off this time. The spirit of the forest actually ends up dying. There's these great and truly frightening scenes where the giant boar is covered in these blood worm things. It's so powerful and horrifying. We get great battle scenes throughout the entire movie of course. It's cliché to teach about the environment, but this movie does it fine. Everything isn't perfect in the end, but at least we've learned something. ****",10,0,1,16 May 2017
Alien: Covenant," Wow, people seem to really hate this movie
","The score isn't that bad but man are these reviews negative. I mean, I admit it's not as good as the original two movies or even 'Prometheus', but it did pretty well on its own. What I like about this movie is that it doesn't even seem like it's going to be a direct sequel to 'Prometheus' at first. It's not until far into the film that we get to see David from the original movie. I really liked the connections this had to that movie. 'Prometheus' wasn't advertised as being in the same Universe, which is why a lot of people were satisfied by the ending.And hey, we get to see the Xenomorphs in their original form here! I will admit it has a lot of weak points. It's annoying how it's just a retread from 'Alien' with a single creature being on the ship. Still, the acting was quite good and I really thought they had a lot of creative ideas even if they weren't done that well. It gets boring at first, but it gets a lot more intense and watchable later on. I thought it was interesting to just compare this to 'Prometheus' and the original 'Alien'. Hate all you want, but I thought this movie was just fine. ***",7,58,100,23 May 2017
Evil Dead II," It's gotten better!
","My favorite movie in the entire series is 'Army Of Darkness', but it's great to look back at these movies and see how they got better with every single entry. I keep hearing that AOD was the one that was quoted the most, but I'm fairly certain this is the one that's the most well known. It's so funny because I've seen so many brief clips from this movie before. Whether it's Ash's hand hitting himself with the dishes, the final scene, or the laughing furniture, it was just great to see all this stuff put together! Thank you for letting me know more about pop culture! It does have a few flaws in that it is hard to put together with the first film. Of course, I don't care because the end result is so awesome. I am really impressed by the special effects in this. Normally, I don't care for stop motion because it always seems to stick out in a live-action film. This actually did it rather well. I'm not sure if stop motion counts as practical effects. There's a lot of good creativity with the monster designs. It's great to see the series become wackier and bigger as time goes on, all leading up to my favorite entry at the end. I have now seen every movie in the original series. The characters are pretty likable and Ash is as good as ever. It's great to see a horror movie series where the most recurring character is actually the good guy. ***1/2",9,1,1,3 September 2016
Furious 7," As good as the series counts
","This movie became well known because it was honored to Paul Walker who died in a car accident. At least we get to see the final images of this film him enjoying his life. I admit to never even having heard of him or recognize him before his death. This movie is truly epic and I'm really surprised at how much action there is in it! Its only flaw is probably how it does get dumb with the action at times. It just gets so unrealistic at times, but it's still awesome!I have watched these movies out of order, mostly because the first ones weren't that good so I wasn't paying much attention to them. The 'See You Again' music video has over 3 billion views on YouTube! This movie's plot features the brother of a previous film's villain using some new weapon for revenge. It was at this point they really started to make it like a spy film. All the actors are great here, especially Paul Walker of course. Of course it says 'For Paul' at the end and this is the best movie in the series. We may not see you again, but we had fun with you while you were on this Earth. ***1/2",9,0,0,10 July 2018
