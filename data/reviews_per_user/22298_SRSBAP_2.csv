Legend," Song missing from soundtrack.......
",Love this film it has an superb soundtrack. However with that said there is a song played before Frances wedding as it fades to it. It was vaguely familiar but is definitely not on the soundtrack. Heard it twice in the film....could not place it. This particular song is not on the soundtrack. I have listened to the samples on AMAZON that song is missing for sure......anyone else know what song I might be thinking of? It is not 'Chapel of Love' but definitely subtle familiar female voices over a familiar melody. It almost sounds like it might be The Ray Charles Singers and I thought at first it was 'Love Me With All Your Heart by the Ray Charles Singers ? Anyone know what I might be thinking of ?? Thanks......,10,0,2,23 December 2015
