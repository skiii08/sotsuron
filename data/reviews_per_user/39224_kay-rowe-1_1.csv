The Sound of Music," remake
","I don't know why they need to do a remake, you cant improve already perfection don't you think?. The film is already one of the greatest timeless films we have. Why do a remake when its only going to go down like the titanic loll because it wont have Julie Andrews and please don't forget good old Chrisphor Plummer as well. But knowing the general public they will be fickle and go and watch it and see what the film is like. Its bad enough Andrew Lloyd Webber is doing a stage production and looking for a Maria on TV. I think he thinks he cant do no wrong but I think he will get his comeuppance with this one hopefully. Why dose he have have to do remake all the time,has he forgotten how to write a play of his own.",10,3,10,15 August 2006
