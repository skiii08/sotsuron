The Ring," terrific
","The best thing about THE RING - and there's a lot of good things in it - is that this is a horror film that doesn't insult your intelligence. Forget about that 'don't go in that dark place/open the door to the creepy axe-murderer' kind of thing. You won't get any of that here, I promise.Basically, this is a story 'Ã  la Sherlock Holmes': there's a murder (actually 4 murders). In comes Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the victims. On the day of her niece's funeral, she meets some of the teenager's friends that tell Rachel about this tape. Rachel's also a journalist and starts investigating the murders on her own. The clues will soon bring her to the possession of the accursed tape. She watches it. Then, everything gets really creepy.The photography is superb! The movie has a greyish hue all over it, making the story even more brooding and menacing. The setting is Seattle, a city already plagued by near constant cloudy and rainy weather. You get the feeling that Verbinsky's been watching a lot of Ingmar Bergman and Kubrik as inspiration. The shots, during the wake, with Aidan framed by the corridors and staircase reminded me o 'The Shinning'; also, the way time goes by is very much 'shinningish'.The plot takes us through the investigation, as we watch Rachel Keller putting together the pieces around this puzzling death. At the same time, she has to come to grips with her child - Aidan, who never calls her 'mum' - and her estranged ex-boyfriend, Noah.When finally Rachel puts the puzzle together, it still doesn't make sense. We can't understand how did that tape got recorded in the first place. This was the reason some people criticized the film, but it goes to show that sometimes you don't need to show everything. Suffice to say that the murderer is not human.Kudos to the director and the crew, and also for superb performances all around. This film has a great dramatic depth and a lot of character development, even though the story centres more on the investigation than the synergies between characters. The plot goes around the mystery, with great editing.",10,9,16,22 September 2006
Match Point," Not your 'typical' Woody Allen film!
","I just saw it last night, and boy (!) was I impressed. I'm a big fan of Woody's, but that in no part relates to my appreciation of this magnificent piece of film. The 'trademarks' that make his films likable (or dislikable) are absent in this one: no jerky-poignant-mid-life-crisis-humour, even though it still (and always) relates to the conflicts of people, the struggle between doing 'the right thing' and what we really want from life, the battle between love and lust. It could have been a cliché for all of this, but it's smart and refreshing instead. In fact, the only thing that gives it away early on (as a Woody Allen film) is probably the main title, as it is so 'woody-allenish'! It's a story that demands a certain commitment from the viewer. Anyway, you can't just drop into the story; you have to sit through it!The story telling is terrific, and even though it seems slow at the beginning, it only seems that: the rhythm of the film is masterful, and there's always something going on, character and story wise. The performances are delivered with accuracy. Especially the role of Rhys Meyers, who reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix in 'the Gladiator': that same fiendish look in the eye, that cynical stance that gives him a predatory gait, as if he knew what was going to happen first hand. It's a guy whose ambition knows no bounds, yet has the brains to keep himself innocuous and small. The other anchor of the storyline is Scarlet, in her most daring role yet. She is the unwilling Femme Fatalle; she doesn't make things happen, but is instead a catalyst of the events that unfold (so 'anti-Catherine Tramell').One thing that I didn't find in character with Chris Wilton's (Meyers) attitude was that he always seemed (throughout the film) quite a cold, calculating guy, that would feel no more remorse for doing what he did that for ordering fried chicken at a vegetarian restaurant. At the end, the finale would have been perfect (IMO) if he had smiled. That simple gesture would show how he came to grips with his actions, as a character that never looks back. As it is, we feel like, somehow, he could be overcome with grief. But that's only speculation, of course.The character point of view is so well defined, that you find yourself thinking like him, considering the 'necessary evil'. You can love him or hate him all you want, but it will never make you feel indifferent.Even though there's a lot of morality involved, the script isn't cheap and cynical, and you get that at the very end. Woody might have gone for the moral approach, but he ditched it, and that's one of the many reasons why the film is plausible: sometimes the bad guys win and justice isn't always served! He's a truly Machiavellian character, struggling to remove every nuisance from his life on his path to glory. Fortitude is always at his side, from the little ironies to the people that stand around him. Reminds me of an illustration from the book in the 'the ninth gate', in which there's a caption saying: 'virtue lies defeated'. It sure has in 'Match Point'; it's about doing the wrong thing to do the right thing.9 out of 10!",9,0,0,27 April 2006
Predator," what's the secret?
","what's so good about this film (if you consider it's style became formulaic in recent years), is that it tries not to be intriguing. I believe that it was Brian Aldiss that once said of science fiction: 'the trick is not to explain everything'. it sure works here for this film! if you think about it, even the simple title 'predator', doesn't give away much. If you have never seen this film or talked to anybody that has about it (if you lived in a cave, perhaps) the title would trow you off. Predator... what kind of predator? Who, or what is the predator? the humans, to begin with (the commando team), but soon after the ultimate killing machine steps in.The story doesn't wallow pointlessly into the origins of the creature. It, quite unapologetically, shows that it came from outer space, and that should be enough. The premise is simple: 'it came to earth, it's different from us and it feels no remorse', got it? No pseudo-philosophies on 'are we alone in the universe' or 'it came in peace' or some crap like that. It delivers the story of the hunter being hunted. Period.As for character development, it goes without saying that it's remarkably sparse but effective; it gives some insight into their experiences, but in a bonding kind of way, without referring to 'combat trauma', 'shell shock' or other problems posed incessantly by other films. It's enough to be believable, like in 'Alien'. You can tell who's best bud's with each other. It's not a soap opera, it's just an action film! The acting is well all around, considering that this is not a very dramatically demanding story for anybody (and the fact that neither are particularly gifted actors). The script is precise, it doesn't force the cast to act stupid, or insults the intelligence of the audience; another reason why it works! It never tries to explain much, it sure leaves open questions at the end, but you don't get that feeling of a plot hole in the story.The visuals are stunning. The art direction turns the jungle into an enemy on its own accord, shooting at highly tilted angles to give you a sense of isolation, of how small you are, of something lurking in the trees, that you are being watched. While this is only suggested in the first half of the film, it becomes clear that it is really the case in the second part.The story is simple and convincing. The plot actually gives you a reason for the commandos to be there, it's not a typical 'they went into the jungle after some Axe murderer to get chopped to bits' kind of thing. We are led to believe that it's a rescue mission and get that feeling of betrayal when we find out the real purpose.The creature is amazing; applause to Stan Winston and also James Cameron (he suggested the fangs 'thingy'). An alien that doesn't just seem to be fetched out of the star trek reject bin. Doesn't look like a human in a Halloween costume at all. Like the creature from Alien, this is totally refreshing and original. Plus, it carries the most spectacular apparatus of killing contraptions ever devised on film. It seem like a daemon, at times, because it's in in for the kill. But that just goes to show what happens when you are not at the top of the food chain.John Mctiernan delivered an absolute gem with this one. The pacing is superb, the photography (by Donald McAlpine)is brilliant; he turns the somewhat dull green environment of the jungle into a character of its own. The editing is master full, taking you where the story wants to, driving you into a crescendo of fear (that part when Carl Weathers bites the big one come to mind!).Definitely 'Ah-nuld's' best!",9,6,7,4 May 2006
