Scarface," The movie as it should be
","The movie as it should be. A solid work which contains every aspect of heroes story life. His dramatic past and tragic present. Telling about life and death. About the man who own his life. Man who knows what he wants. Man who have honor and ambitions. And the story which tells about the price the man like him should pay in this world. The film also tells us about the time he lives in. Time what changes from what he knew to something he can not accept. Time where thugs act with law and hide behind it. Time where cowards and greed rules the world. Film shows what the man like him can not fit in this time. The tragedy about changing time where power of one man replaced with with collective power of every weak person. Film has perfect camera work, and great music. The film i watched at least 10 times and would watch it more with a great pleasure. And everyone should.",10,0,2,6 April 2014
