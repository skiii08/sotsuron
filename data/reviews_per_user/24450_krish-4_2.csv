The Blair Witch Project," Nauseating
","Scary ? ha ha ha. This movie somehow generated hype, probably because it was offbeat. That is all that can be said about it. The frenzied and jittery camera movements (to simulate a documentary) creates a certain sickening effect. The characters are moronic, the realization is ineffective, the storyline is nonexistent and the overall effect is just intolerable. Just because a movie is offbeat does not make it good. If you ignore budget considerations, this movie tops Wild Wild West in the list of this summer's lemons. At least you don't feel like throwing up (sleepy maybe) after sitting through WWW.",1,0,2,1 August 1999
Deja Vu," Moronic (Spoilers)
","This film starts well but descends into a mess of sci-fi nonsense pretty soon. Set in post Katrina New Orleans, US scientists have apparently managed to create worm holes and have warped space time fabric so much as to go back to past and even alter it. Yeah - right! Let them build better levees first.Anyway once you are on a slippery slope there is no turning back. Denzel and his merry men start going into the past and altering it. First it is a note that is sent through something that seems like a nuclear powered microwave. Then comes an even more moronic trip on a hummer with a space age goggle that looks at the past. Everything comes to a head when Denzel himself goes into the microwave to be teleported back to the past. But he only had to wear undies. Not even shoes for some 'scientific' reason.The movie continues its downward spiral with Denzel falling in love, managing to alter the past (of course), dying and coming back again and making sure that the initial explosion never took place. All the children and families are alive ... thanks to this incredible machine that can now change the past. Hey - maybe in a sequel (god forbid) they will improve the machine enough to undo 9-11 or Katrina or even maybe WWII.The whole movie is just an insult to intelligence of the viewer.",2,5,13,20 May 2007
