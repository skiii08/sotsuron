Blade Runner 2049," A product of 21st Century Movie Making - watch it again
","First off, I'll just say now I loved this film. Just like the original divided opinion, so has this, but that's ok. Some of the best films do that. Yeah, it's ponderous. Sure, the visuals may feel like style over substance. And at times, it is a cold and calculating journey into the dark decay of humanity. It's not an uplifting film. Nor was the first, to be fair, and if you come to Blade Runner 2049 without watching the first one, then I can understand the haters.I can also understand the hate from fans of the first movie, if I'm honest. Here is a film that just couldn't be like the first. Star Wars, Alien, Indiana Jones etc, those products of 70s/80s film phenomenon, have undergone sequels and reboots which have been, largely, poorly remakes/sequels of much loved films. If this has told movie makers anything, it's told them to be fresh. Original. New.Blade Runner 2049 largely succeeds in doing this by putting a replicant front and centre as the main character; in effect a child in a man's body. This is less a story of love between man and robot as in the first film (or robot and robot) but explicitly the tragedy of playing god, and the creation of slavery. And it does it well. However, it works better when the mini-movies are viewed before the film. I know many people who didn't watch these and so Wallace's motives and actions feel excessive and absurd, and the Sapper's death is meaningless.It's the norm to put out mini-movies for promotion and add levels of entertainment, but it also disguises flaws in the movie itself. I don't know how the director could have incorporated the Wallace and Sapper scenes into the movie without complicating the timeline, but for me they are important to the storyline. They add context and motive.Overall, Blade Runner 2049 deserves another viewing by those who hadn't seen the mini-movies beforehand, and think the film is a bad one.I guess just like the original Blade Runner did.",8,2,7,7 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Could've been a lot worse; could be better
","No spoilers, just opinion. This is not the worst Star Wars film, but it's one that reveals so many weaknesses, as it does it strengths. That it's the 9th movie in a very flawed franchise says much of the passion of fans and the film makers. No, it's not a cash grab, but a labour of love from all those involved. Perhaps too much love, as what is jettisoned is good story writing (for a plot that unravels the moment you begin thinking about it), a decent script and that sense of wonder from the first trilogy. What we get is an apologetic love-letter to the series, which is great on some levels, disappointing on others. Could this have been better? Given a year of re-writes and less sentiment, yes. So much better. Would that have made a Star Wars film? No. Star Wars is a sentimental series, full of flaws. It's the ending it deserved. The first film could've so easily failed. It didn't deserve Empire which is one of the finest SF films made. Return of the Jedi was a fitting sequel. And so is this. Rejoice that its ended, and not so badly. And that Phantom Menace wasnt the swan-song we could so easily have had.",7,2,8,30 December 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Appreciated better after several barrels of rum
","With such a big budget and some A-list actors you'd expect a movie that delivers ... er... entertainment, even if it's pure popcorn. The latest Pirates movie delivers on precious little. Not even the welcome cameo of beloved characters can save it from capsizing. This is a bad movie. Not good - bad either. Bad - bad. The plot is non-existent and the SFX is just dressing for a lumpen, dull mess. The direction and editing is the worst I've seen in a movie since Young Einstein. Even the actors act like amateurs, their lines mumbled ineptly from one scene to the next.
A 5/10, then because I like the monkey, Jack. And because I like the sea. And because this film will have sunk the Pirate genre for good, may she rest in peace ... Urargh...",5,0,0,14 June 2019
Alien: Covenant," The art of screenwriting is dead... Long live mediocrity
","Alien: Covenant pretty much sums up what is wrong with Hollywood at the moment: it's a bankable franchise if you throw enough money at each movie, but it's also a dumping ground for weak story-telling. A younger Ridley Scott would have pored over each fault in the story-line/screenplay, discarding what doesn't seem logical but you can appreciate that those finer nuances of directing have gone the way of vitality. Who can blame him, really?
This film is not a result of bad directing, but film-goers who will accept each movie like a slow death, ensuring 20th Century Fox skip on anything like common sense or treating their audience with having any intelligence. The film is, quite simply, illogical and dumb. The SFX are brilliant as you would expect these days, the acting is passable given the awful lines they have to deliver, and the directing is dining out on a meagre offering, that if you wanted to discard what doesn't work, you'd have to rewrite the whole mess.
Is it entertaining? Well yes, but only if you leave your brain in a jar by the side of your bed and try not to think about it after. When you do it unravels. I mean, seriously? Aliens that turn from young to full adults in minutes? So many plot-holes you can drive a colony-ship through them. A crew that are so stupid, it makes the crew of the Nostromo look like Noble Peace Prize winners. 
Another psycho android that might have been interesting if it had been explained better. Just another opportunity jettisoned for unnecessary profanity (I mean, for fxxksake how much swearing was there in this film, that didn't add anything to character or wit, or anything for that matter). Given the screen time for characters there was naff-all characterisation.
Even writing this, thinking about the movie, my head hurts. This is a film that contributes absolutely nothing to the series, to films in general, and I've reduced my stars from 6 to 5, because I'm being kind, and the soundtrack wasn't bad.
Meh.",5,1,1,15 January 2018
