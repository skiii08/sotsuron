The Incredible Hulk," Not 'Iron Man' but good enough for now
","There is nothing wrong with this version of the 'Incredible Hulk.' Everything from the actors to the production values feels right. In brief, the story gets the job done and there are enough human moments to carry the viewer through the action sequences that on occasion have a little too much action. The effects are fine, though most of them are standard issue things-blow-up-real-good stuff and sophisticated viewers will no doubt 'see the wires' in some of the shots. (I must mention that the effect involving the Sound Cannons is new and very well done -- such a weapon is I believe feasible and readers of 'Atlas Shrugged' will not doubt appreciate the possible reference to the 'Thompson Harmonizer.') I liked the movie in other words and I think most people will too, but leaving the theater, keeping in mind all that the movie had going for it, I had to wonder why I didn't like it as much as 'Iron Man.' It's hard to pin down but I think the gist of it is that Tony Stark the hero of 'Iron Man' is always engaging the world, positively or negatively, and there is a pronounced character arc to his story. We get a real sense, thanks to Downey's remarkable performance, that his transformation could really happen. That it does happen in movie time, of course, means they happens way too fast for real life, but Downey makes us believe it. We like and cheer for him no matter what he does. There is never a trace of self-pity in him. Banner on the other hand is always on the run and his determined refusal to come to grips with his world distances himself from us throughout the movie. Likely his particular plight works better on television then on the large screen, especially in a movie as over the top as this one. Plenty of us can feel sympathy for Banner, I certainly can, but on the whole most of us aren't that compelled to watch a movie about it.Another complaint I had was his relationship with Betty. Since we see nothing of what transpired before the laboratory episode between them, I had strong doubts that she would pitch aside her current relationship in an instant when Banner makes an appearance. I kept waiting for the 'I love you Bruce but I'm not in love with you' scene, but it never came. Tiresome as that scene is, it is credible, and what I was seeing on the screen was not. Even Spiderman II handled that situation better, though admittedly not by much.The final problem is this: what is really going on inside the Hulk's mind? Banner dismisses the notion but the transformation from raw, unstoppable force, to caring super-beast is strongly implied but we have no idea why, let alone how, it took place. Iron man inside his suit is still Tony Stark, but Banner inside the Hulk we are told is nothing, a zero, gone. We don't believe it, we can't believe it on the basis of what is happening on the screen, yet we are given nothing to work with to resolve the conflict.So the film is a good beginning to the series and the way these stories interlock in future films should be quite interesting. 'The Incredible Hulk' is not 'Iron Man' but by the very nature of the material it was probably impossible that it would be.",8,1,4,14 June 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," 'There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.'
","The quote in the summary is from Shakespeare and while not wanting to appear pretentious, I thought I would try something different in this mini-essay, something more along the lines of a critical assessment than an actual review (irrelevant now -- the audience has spoken, decisively) because I believe many of the A-list critics (see www.rottentomatoes.com for the grim details), missed the boat on this wonderful film. This is a fully and beautifully realized world of myth, magic, and voodoo and happily everyone keeps a straight face as they confront it. If the symbology is a bit too literal at times, well, the sea brings that out in people, particularly in this part of the world of three centuries ago. Where creatures, such as the Kraken, a beast of relentless fury, can be slowed but not stopped. Where the 'heartless' Davy Jones collides with the Flying Dutchman (a conflation that I believe is a first). And where, despite the rich fantasy, the emotions, conflicts, psychologies are all too real, even in Jack Sparrow (the role Johnny Depp was born to play). He is heading for a terrible fall, as in truth are all the major characters. Elizabeth has come to understand that whatever the degree of her attraction for Jack, the man simply cannot be trusted. His core is hollow, which I suspect Jack himself now realizes and is at the root of his deep problem that he no longer knows what he wants. He knows what he doesn't want, to be sure, yet it is unclear to what degree he can fight back against even that realization. And poor Will Turner, clearly stretched to the limit, is in a situation nearly as bad. Others are also in supreme jeopardy. (One of the great things about this film is the taking of minor characters from the first film, such as Norrington, and putting them head to head against Sparrow and Turner -- and watching them hold their own as they come to grips with their own fate.)In short, there is the possibility for great tragedy here -- if the writers have the courage to follow through (no more rum and cross-dressing jokes, please!) Could we have a Hamlet on the high seas? I believe we could. The elements are there -- but will marketing permit it? It's anyone's guess. Following the analogy of POTC:DMC being the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the trilogy, we all know what happened in that case: will a great opportunity be lost as we endure the sea-going equivalent of 'Ewoks?' Or worse? I am worried. As is well-known, shooting of the third film began before the script was complete, a bad sign. The next installment could go all the way (on the order of ET and Titanic), but it would be foolish to count on it.Still to have come this far is an incredible achievement. To those A-list critics (3:2 against) who either did not watch the movie or could not bring themselves to view the first film -- there's a reason it's called a sequel, guys -- for shame. But as noted, the public, and indeed the world, has spoken. Good luck to all people involved in the production of the concluding film : 'At World's End.'",9,3,5,25 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Astonishing, thrilling, relentless, but the screenplay . . .
","I am recommending this movie, never doubt that. The good news is that Jack is back and the Black Pearl has him. There are a lot of funny bits, the action sequences are every bit as good as you have heard, and the pacing is just right. The nearly three hours zips right along. And the story resolution among Elizabeth, William, and his father works fine. Yes, do stay for the final scene after the credits. (And for those who hate Bloom & Knightly, go away. The actors are doing exactly what these movies ask of them and doing it very well.) And there truly is so much here to commend in this film, particularly as we follow our heroes to the 'haunted shores' of the afterlife. Time after time you will be asking yourself: how did they do that? As a mythology, it never flags and the three movies taken together are a remarkable cinematic accomplishment which took increasing risks that paid off.So why am I sour on the screen play? Here's the problem. As is well known, when they started shooting the final film (Note: they only completed 40% of AWE when they were filming DMC), the screen play for the third was not yet finished. This is a bad thing. See this movie and you will understand why this is a bad thing. What happens when you do that is story holes open up. And what do I mean by holes? It means a given character acts as the screenplay demands he act -- forget about what the character has said/done prior or what we know about him or have seen him do. He/she has become a puppet to the screenplay. I could easily list three major instances where this happened and I am sure any fan going through the movie scene by scene could come up with many more.It did not have to be. The two screen writers are first rate as is the director. But once marketing and management got a hold of the thing, it became schedule-driven and I guess it couldn't be stopped. Certainly, Disney did not return my calls. To be fair, probably most viewers will not notice or will not care. But greatness beckoned, and they settled for okay and full-speed ahead for the effects.Oh well, I'll see it again anyway.",8,3,5,27 May 2007
I Am Legend," Going to the dogs: Hollywood and the lost art of the screenplay
","I did not go into 'I am Legend' expecting much. I liked the Charleton Heston version and there was also one other I have not seen. To be fair, there was some good stuff in the movie, here and there: the numerous shots of NYC devoid of people are impressive and though one soon feels the profusion of such shots is unnecessary (only the dimmest would not have gotten the point early on), it was understandable that the producers are eager to share their accomplishment. The movie must have cost a bundle. Better use it all.Moreover, Will Smith has a few effective scenes, and it was not his fault that he was upstaged by his canine co-star, who deserves some kind of animal Oscar (I believe there actually is such a thing). Finally, the myth of 'I Am Legend' is a powerful one. It's a strong story, the kind of story it would take considerable effort to mess up. Who has not felt at times that he is among the last of humanity, struggling to survive while surrounded by vampires (figurative vampires) -- perhaps at a family gathering or company picnic? Yet the movie can be barely said to work. It is one of those films in which any given scene is either good, but we've seen it before, many times before, or bad, and we really don't want to see it now at all. A film in which drama is repeatedly sacrificed to special effects and big scenes. One leaves the film not so much hating it, but wondering what was the point? To the screen writers of this travesty here is a clue: without drama, there can be no point. This is terribly lazy screen writing. For example, the credits reference the work of both prior screenplays. Did the currently screen writers somehow find the original source material weak and insufficient? If so, why even make the movie? This is what we call a bad sign.Here is an example of how bad it is, one of many. Since nothing substantive follows from the scene, I think I can describe it without spoiling anything.The scene is a flashback. It shows a huge, panicking crowd trying to escape. People are being given eye scans to see if they have contracted the virus (what the virus turns the infected into will be noted shortly.) A soldier who is doing the scanning, first gets a bad (positive) reading on the hero's wife. Now remember, Smith's character is a medical doctor. One of the Army's highest ranking in fact. Here's what happens. Smith starts yelling at the soldier, screaming out his rank and demanding the man scan his wife again. The soldier complies (why would he be reluctant to give a second scan?). This time the reading is negative. End of scene.What is wrong here? For one thing, a real doctor would know at once that either the instrument is defective or the soldier does not know how to use it. Since the procedure is quite simple, the latter possibility can be ignored. There's not much time. The first, however, cannot. There is a grave risk that the instrument is defective. Which means infected people have likely been allowed through. His wife may be now become of them. Remember, Smith is a top ranking military doctor. He must be aware of that risk. He must be aware of his responsibilities. What to do? What a real doctor would do is stop everything, use another detector, and perform the scan again.The situation now is quite tense. If his wife passes this scan, at least we can be confident that she is free of the disease. But if she fails He tests her again. Either way, the danger of infected people having gotten through is considerable. The terror on Smith's face should show the decisions he has to make and at once.This alternative scene would also, btw, tie directly with a later scene, the best in the film, so the audience would be prepared for it.But the variant scene, the one with that thing we call drama, is not in the movie. Instead we get explosions, helicopters spinning out of control, and a chance for Smith to bawl out a white guy for no reason whatever. The whole screen play is like that.It gets worse. Smith talks along with an entire sequence in Shrek (I) to tell us how much he loves that movie? Why? What does this add? He gives us a lecture on how much he likes Bob Marley's music. I like it too, but why are these scenes here? What is the point? (I suspect, cynically no doubt, the company that made 'I Am Legend' has financial interests in both).There is also something vaguely racist about the whole business. If you imagine a movie about a white doctor being besieged Well, this film piles it on. New York is perhaps the most diverse city on earth. Why, when the plague hits does it turn the victims into incredibly buff, twenty-something, white people (who would be killers on a basketball court)? Smith really hates them. One long action scene demonstrates the full degree of that hatred -- but they are his patients, for god's sake! Why in that scene would he risk throwing his life away for the sheer joy of killing them? And wouldn't you think that Smith, who is himself is immune to the plague, as a doctor would find that fact an incredibly important clue? Nope. He does nothing with it.Ebert has written about the offensive stranger on the bus. The smelly, boring, crude, and obnoxious individual, always too close for comfort and who is impossible to ignore. Now imagine a two hour bus ride with that individual. That is what this movie and its screen play is like.For shame on all concerned.Except, Sam the dog.",3,18,43,22 December 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Saving the series
","After the fourth film, I had decided I would skip the remainder and move on with my life. I liked what the films had done, liked the cast, and the production was always first rate, but the feeling on my part was 'so what?' I found myself wishing Rawlings had stopped at five books. I no longer felt involved.Happily I can say I was completely wrong. A few weeks ago, I began to hear buzz that this film was very good indeed. And the reviews on the well-known movie review site were remarkably positive, so I decided to give it try. I am sure glad I did. This films works, there is real danger and conflict, and the actors, old friends and new, rise to the occasion. It is a movie with children, not a children's movie. 'Teenage adults,' I probably should say.As always the world of HP is beautifully realized and the new characters are fully developed and fit in perfectly. In the case of the new head-mistress of the defense against the black arts, the monster is as loathsome as can be. There is still plenty of humor in the movie, but it is humor with a bite. This is probably the most ruthlessly satirical of the films (so far) and well-worth seeing more than once. People who complained about POTC:AWE may well complain about this one too as it gets fairly complex who is doing what to whom, but the pacing never flags and the ride is well-worth it.Particularly interesting is newcomer Evanna Lynch as 'Luna Lovegood,' a traumatized character who seems at first will just be played for cruel humor, but comes into her own as a fighter fully worthy of the Order of the Phoenix. This is a wonderful film debut and certainly offers promise of her going on to do great things.I even found myself wishing it had been longer. This movie definitely saves the series and primes us for the final two films. Now, I can hardly wait to see them. Great job to all concerned, especially the director.",9,2,5,14 July 2007
300," Porno-history -- it works, but there are problems
","First the good news. The movie looks every bit as good as you would have hoped. The performances are surprising effective, with Gerard Butler doing an outstanding job holding the film together. If he had faltered, the 300 would have been in big trouble. Butler brilliantly conveys the impression of a first-rate leader, a man whose men would follow him anywhere. This is acting that never gets nominated, but it is still great acting. Note to casting: every time you are thinking of George Clooney, get this guy instead. You'll have a much better movie.Finally, while people can and do complain about the historical accuracy, it's actually close enough so that the essence of the story comes through and to be fair (this movie must have just missed an NC-17), and there's no reason to be squeamish about it -- the real battles and atrocities must have been every bit as gory.And yet, for all that, I was disappointed. The subject is so inherently dramatic, I have to wonder why Miller felt compelled to put in so much pornographic imagery, including his signature composition -- the beautiful girl being ravished by the hideously ugly creature(s). Psychologically, I think I understand the gimmick -- the readers of such graphic novels being mostly adolescent boys or such 'at heart' that they are eager to have it both ways: being 'shocked and indignant' at such repulsive actions while at the same time wondering: 'How can I get such a deal?' A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, but it seems that Miller piles it on. Admittedly, I kept hoping the Oracle would return. She (an enthralling Kelly Craig who really needs to get more work) was awfully cute and her advice couldn't be any worse than what your broker gives you.But the bigger issue may be that these images are so overpowering as stills, that they impede the movie's flow. This is a serious problem for a movie like this where flow and movement is everything. It is a credit to everyone involved, and I am especially singling out Butler again, that they keep the thing from stumbling upon the grotesque. 300 was often like a meal with way too many spices. Palatable, but it could have been better.",8,0,3,10 March 2007
