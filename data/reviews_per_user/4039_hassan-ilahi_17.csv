Source Code," Pure entertainment with a punch of humanism inside.
","Over the years, Science-fiction thrillers have either proved to be really good (District 9) or completely rubbish (Skyline)...There really haven't proved to be so many excellent films, but District 9, Inception, and Matrix are my faves. Director Duncan Jones has truly dazzled me with Moon, but that's really it. Jake Gyllenhaal also hasn't proved that he's a well-known actor 'over-the-world'. This film, however, proves me wrong.'Source Code' is a fresh and highly original thriller that exceeds from a visual view, as well as a visceral one. A smart piece of writing and just the right amount of humanism is put in.Performances don't tick so much in these kind of thrillers but Gyllenhaal gives his best. He literally carries the film with his light hands and guides it in the right way. His worthy acting is to watch out for. Even though the other performances weren't paid much attention too, they were at least decent. Monaghan is O.K.; playing her character with simpleness. Vera Farmiga is the same, but slightly better. Rest of cast is natural and fits in.Thrills in this film are highly praise. I was hooked onto the film as soon as it started. Slightly surprising? Well-done transition from the train to the 'pitch-black' hole is shown. Visual Effects have to be one of the year's best...Overall, what can I say...Source Code is definitely worth watching over and over again. Its mind-bending, thought-provoking, and very well-crafted. It also has to be one of the best films I've seen this year, as well in the Sci-fi category. Wow, forget about everything and go see this film!",9,0,2,4 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Worth the wait; the darkest and best of the series.
","Having read the beloved series, I was expecting loads from this film. I was O.K with the series so far; just not liking the structures of the 2nd and 6th. The 6th was a major disappointment and I REALLY wanted something much better. This film is what I got as a spectacular result.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is a sophisticated cinematic experience as well as boasting. Featuring great performances, joyous thrills, and dazzling effects; it also remains known as (for me) the darkest and best out of them all. Wow, what an adaptation...Making this film well worth the watch are notably well-orchestrated performances. From little 12-year old's to mature 17 year old's is a huge transition. Yet, its very well performed. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint; give performances that seem to show their hidden talents. Radcliffe is good, but still better than what I saw of him in the last 6 movies. He is charming, reluctant, and efficient. Grint is also the same; adding nostalgic humorous moments throughout the film; as well as maturity ones. Watson is great; having improved the same as the other two.The thrills throughout this film are unbelievably appraisal. The 'jump-out-of-your-seat' scares are VERY well-done. Making them even better are the dazzling effects and visuals. So, beautifully filmed and pretty scary! Overall, this is the best 'Potter' you'll see yet, mainly because of more maturity and darkness than the other ones. It's a thrilling ride that's well acted and genuinely directed. A perfect example of a great book adaptation. Man...I just can't wait for Part 2!",8,0,1,2 April 2011
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg's best film (in terms of direction).
","There's not a person in Hollywood that doesn't know about Steven Spielberg. This director has dazzled people with masterpieces such as 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Jurassic Park', 'The Indiana Jones Trilogy', and 'Amistad'. He's also known today as one of the most wealthiest filmmakers in the world.Tom Hanks is just an amazing actor. The kind that REALLY puts his soul towards his character/role and plays towards perfection. He's known for 'Forrest Gump', 'Cast Away', 'The Green Mile', 'Apollo 13', 'Sleepless in Seattle', and 'Big'.Saving Private Ryan is by far one of the best war films I've seen, as well as one of Spielberg's best. It features outstanding acting, terrific cinematography, a powerful storyline, and of course, Captivating direction.Hanks doesn't disappoint as Captain John Miller. He plays the character with determination, fear, and dedication. One of the BEST performances I've seen from him. Matt Damon is great too, in his brief, yet convincing role. Edward Burns and the rest of the soldiers are simply terrific.Well-done cinematography is experienced throughout the film. The camera angles are just so dashing and terrific, that you simply cannot keep your eyes of this film. 'Horrific, yet gripping and intensifying'.Storyline makes this film what it really is. Its powerful in a brutal and unforgiving way. I almost cried in the end, but its a true story and highly realistic in a lot of ways. Unfortunately, its sometimes painful to watch the war scenes. Bloody and extremely violent scenes, but again, worth watching.Overall, this film is a must-see and CANNOT be missed by any movie-goer. The type of impressive direction Spielberg pulls of and Hank's astonishing performance are BIG TIME watching. Though beware again, this film is outright bloody, so don't go see it if you don't like these kind of films.",10,1,2,21 March 2011
Good Will Hunting," Brilliant take on coming age-of-teens.
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wasn't a very common name to Hollywood in the 90s. They only came in 'average' films that nobody cared about. Fortunately, they won respect from everyone after this film came out...Getting to my 'review', this film is literally brilliant, dashingly shot, brilliant acted, warmly directed, and profoundly written. Damon and Affleck truly mesmerized me in the film. The acting was great; Damon, Affleck, Williams, Driver, and Sk√†rsgard were all perfect.The script was true and understandable, because of the literal and profound combinations of powerfulness. The 'young' men deserved their Academy Award for their script...As for the Academy Awards (themselves) for a disappointment. Titanic didn't deserve what it got, (especially Best Picture). All the films were simply ruled out, with this one only winning TWO! Williams and Damon/Affleck went home with grins, but the WHOLE cast should have...Other than that, this film is outstanding in every way and shouldn't be missed by older teens and adults alike. The strong message in the end was out-rightly plausible and touching.",10,1,4,15 March 2011
Million Dollar Baby," A very depressing, yet fresh punch of filmmaking.
","Clint Eastwood remains and is still known as a legendary person. He's acted in terrific films like 'Unforgiven' and 'The Good, Bad, and Ugly', as well as directed 'Mystic River' and 'Unforgiven'. You CANNOT despise him of his works, because they are all fresh pieces of art. I had high expectations for this film and it succeeded thoroughly, but in a very grief way.'Million Dollar Baby' is a fresh punch in the face with a total knockout. It features outstanding performances; as well as a trustworthy script. Unfortunately, it falls under a film I won't see again, because of the depressing atmosphere...Acting is basically the category that really makes this film. Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman give staggering performances with lots of characterization. Eastwood is a true genius; he plays 'Frankie' with aggressiveness, courage, and confidence. What a show! Swank is almost better than him; shady, determined; and achieved. Freeman is probably the best; a great narrator, showcased, and calm.The script is 'second-best'. Joining forces with the incredible acting; it really works. Again, lots of credit towards Eastwood.Depression though cannot be under defined. The film is thoroughly grief-full and a bit of a set back. Basically, tearful and the only thing I didn't like about this film.Overall, if you are a movie-goer, go see it right now; you won't be disappointed. Though, be WARNED; its depressing and will make you cry. Clint Eastwood really is even more achieving with this film...",9,1,2,29 March 2011
The Dark Knight," A captivating, sophisticated, and thrilling masterpiece
","Batman Begins was a brilliant and nostalgic version of Batman that director Christopher Nolan brought us. The movie though was underrated by the Academy...So, my expectations for The Dark Knight were high. In the end, I wasn't disappointed...The Dark Knight was a narrow masterpiece that missed no ingredients and exceeded my expectations. The terrible death occurrence of the notable star Heath Ledger though, was shocking. He was perfect as the Joker, sometimes the show-stealer. The rest of the cast was also brilliant like Bale and Freeman.Screenplay, was notably terrific (hitting all the right notes). Nolan's growing and improved direction was Oscar-worthy, sometimes even better. His direction was long ignored by the inclusive Academy. Now, was the time for that to change...Yet, it only went on to win 2 Oscars, while it deserved so much more! Slumdog didn't deserve much...Overall, I am breathless and out of words for the film. Look out for Ledgers amazing performance and Nolan's outstanding direction. A rich and dark film that succeeds as a crime-saga, as well as a great film!",10,2,5,14 March 2011
Titanic," A timeless masterpiece that is also an unforgettable movie experience
","I am breathless and out of words for THIS film. No, its not the best film I've seen, but it certainly comes close to being. James Cameron is a true genius and he's the person to thank.Titanic is a wholesome tragedy adapted from the historic event when more 1000 people lost their lives. This film is pure art and will never be forgotten. It is filled with extravaganza effects, worthy performances, and a simply adorable soundtrack.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances in his career. He is simply perfect as Jack; simple, yet humanized. Kate Winslet is even better, playing Rose with Gratitude, courage, and efficiency. This is also, simply her best performance in her career.Effects are simply breathtaking. James Cameron provides with stuff that you would have never seen in the 90s. As for his direction, also benefits because of his stretchy camera angles and glorious sights. This is seriously Cameron at his BEST and there's nothing more wonderful than that.Small things like soundtracks don't usually matter in films, but this film has the best I have heard in my life! Racy, touching, and emotional; there isn't anything like it.Overall, I have no words for Titanic. Almost everything is near-perfect in this timeless classic. It is also an unforgettable cinematic experience; as well as a benchmark in history for visual effects. James Cameron has got the big job done and has succeeded thoroughly.'Go see it now, because you certainly won't be disappointed one bit with this film'",10,4,6,27 March 2011
A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard's 'beautiful' watch.
","Ron Howard pulled a masterpiece out of 'nowhere' when he made the dark, yet mesmerizing Apollo 13. Russell Crowe made Gladiator a brutal, yet awarding film. My expectations for this film were high, and was hoping something more would be the outcome. I really have to say I wasn't surprised.A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful watch from reluctant director Ron Howard. It features his intelligent direction, the cast's unimaginable talent, and a brilliant storyline.Intelligent and smart 'stuff' isn't seen every day in film, but Howard sure knows how to get the job done. With the outstanding screenplay, it just fit in. The beautiful shots with the sharp and accurate camera angles deserve some acclaim and now he's gonna get it.The performances are exceptional. Russel Crowe demonstrates to us what the meaning and purpose of acting really is. He is brilliant as the suffering John Nash. Connelly is also great, she gives a thoughtful, yet sophisticated performance as his wife. Rest of the cast are always too great; (Bettany and Harris).Overall, A Beautiful Mind is one of the most Oscar deserving Pictures of the century! It is an outstanding combination of 'out-of-the-world' direction and acting. That's the reason it guards Howard and Crowe's Oscar.",9,0,0,18 March 2011
The Departed," A golden effort from a legendary director
","Martin Scorsese has always been known as A legendary director. With masterpieces like 'Raging Bull', 'Good fellas', 'Taxi Driver', and 'Casino', Scorsese never fails to at the very least impress. This film proves that Scorsese is brilliant at doing what he does best.The Departed is an infuriation of excellence. Watching it is like watching exploding fireworks in the sky. The film captures an unseen, brutal part of Boston, showing it in an undeniably intensifying way. It's filled with excellent performances, outstanding direction, and a great screenplay.This thriller is filled with jarringly flawless performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon's on-screen 'battle' is suspenseful. You can actually feel yourself rooting for one of them. DiCaprio is furious and exuberant, while Damon is smart and curious. Jack Nicholson makes for a charismatic star in this film. His performance is certainly worthwhile freakish. Lastly, Mark Wahlberg is hilarious. I really haven't seen a better performance from him. Other actors including Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Vera Farmiga are decent.Scorsese may not have ventured into this theme so much, apart from Goodfellas, but it mostly seems so. The different camera angles and intelligent shots are dazzling. Inclusive to some overdone foul language and blood/gore, it eventually pays off. I'm definitely counting this film as a worthy Scorsese brilliancy.It's not easy to write scripts, but this film has an engrossing one. From the start to end, the film is entertaining enough to keep on going. It has a highly suspenseful and sometimes abrupt climax, but otherwise, no problem.Overall, there's really not enough to justify this achievement. It may not come to the likes of people not familiar with substance material, but it's a must-see for any Scorsese fan. A star-studded cast, worthy direction, and 'exciting' screenplay back up as proof.",9,0,0,3 June 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A disheartening, heartwarming, and joyous classic about a serious subject matter.
","Not many films have stunned me over the years. There's been some great ones and then some brilliant ones, but no film really 'did' it for me. I have my favorites like 'Forrest Gump' and 'The Shawashank Redemption', but again, that's not a lot. Cuckoo just did it for me.It's been about 30 years (if not exact) to when this masterpiece came out. As a mainstream success, it won many awards, including 5 Oscars. One of those 5, was for Best Picture. That was why I decided to see this film. It came on this website as a high-rated classic. To that point, I was not surprised at how much this film affected me.'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is an unforgettable classic that affected me lots. It contains fascinating performances, an excellent screenplay, and great direction, not to mention a joyous soundtrack.The performances in this film are so worth the watch. Jack Nicholson gives his career-best performance as 'McMurphy'. He delivers his soul towards his masterful performance and demonstrates an advanced understanding towards this film. His other films don't reach the heights of this one. Loise Fletcher, on the other hand, gives a brilliant performance as the 'nurse'. She lawfully is completely different, self disciplined and serious. Both these performances cause a dramatic on- screen battle. For me, its Jack Nicholson who wins.An excellent screenplay is orchestrated throughout this film. Michael Douglas hasn't ever done such a wonderful job. This film, however, is disheartening at times, but also heartwarming, forming a nice combination. When a film deals with a serious subject matter, but has a hilarious tone to it, not to make it depressing.Lastly, the soundtrack of this film is highly praise. The joyous moments of this film flow very well this soundtrack. Unbelievable, indeed...Overall, this film is certainly worth the watch. If you haven't seen it, you've missed out on a film that changed my life. The ending of this film may seem abrupt, but I got over it, so no worries.10/10",10,1,2,20 May 2011
Inception," A masterpiece that will never be forgotten
","Not many directors have had such a successful career as Christopher Nolan. Ranging from great films like 'Memento' to masterpieces like 'The Dark Knight', Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors of the past decade, even if he hasn't released many films...I had extremely high expectations for this film after I saw the trailer (the year before). Leonardo DiCaprio was underrated and Christopher Nolan was man full of smart turns and mind-blowing scripts. The film (itself) had a brilliant plot, which was very intriguing for me.After I saw the film, I realized how right I actually was! Inception is the rare film of the year that exceeds as a blockbuster, as well as a great film. Not many films can accomplish just 'that', and that's what makes Inception worth your time and money.The performances brilliant, but who really exceeds this time is DiCaprio. He plays his character towards ultra perfection and emotional consensus. He is perfect as Cobb. The rest of the cast is good too: Caine, Page, Hardy, Levitt, Cotiliard, Watanabe, and Murphy pull of a perfect, yet mesmerizing job.The script is absolutely dashing. Nolan does a much better job that 'The Dark Knight'. Mind-blowing and truly original are the words that describe it. The Direction couldn't have been better. Again, all thanks to Nolan, because of his complex universe.Overall, Inception is probably the best film you'll see this year, certainly the best of its genre (sci-fi). Christopher Nolan creates a complex, yet mesmerizing world of his own! Everyone will simply praise this film, and it won't be forgotten for sure. Go see Inception now, and you surely won't be disappointed. You can even watch this film over and over again to completely understand it! 10/10",10,0,8,16 March 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," A brutal, yet astonishing film that remains believable in every aspect...
","Frank Dabaront is not a name that is known to everybody...He certainly isn't the most popular director on the planet. Regardless, he has made a film that has touched people all over the world. The film that is brutal, yet astonishing: Shawshank Redemption.I first of all, wasn't surprised at all that this was the highest-rated film on IMDb. It has every ingredient a film needs...Universe, creation, acting, and a powerful storyline. The rare film that extraordinarily grabbed me and never let go...Also the rare film that exceeds in every aspect.The film is obviously believable too, Freeman and Robbins pull in extra perfection to it. Freeman is a brilliant narrator, and he tells us the plot like it was rehearsed a couple thousand times! Robbins is also surprisingly great, he plays the (main) character with adorable gratitude and unstoppable force. His performance is worth watching over and over again...Overall, its not for everyone to see (like the impeccable Forrest Gump), but it all shapes up with a powerful ending and a strong message.",10,0,0,14 March 2011
The Matrix," The benchmark for all 'Science-Fiction' films to come.
","Science Fiction wasn't an extremely well-known genre in the 90's. Yes, there was films such as 'Blade Runner' and 'Star Wars', but nothing else that had set a standard. Right when you thought there was no specialty, 'The Matrix' miraculously fixed that problem...The Matrix is undeniably a brilliant film, as well as an outstanding experience. Yes, this film has some sort of flaws, but forget that, it has a creative and highly addictive world of it's own. I literally got sucked into this film till the very end. The script, performances, direction, and visual effects are memorable.A script (in my opinion), is the most important part of an amazing 'sci- fi' film. This film's script is jarring and exuberant. The whole idea of 'Matrix' is creative and delusional. This word does come from Mathematics, but this is a whole new meaning. Finely written storytelling at it's very best.Keanu Reeves is NOT an actor I admire. I find him dull and blank most of the time. This film, however, proves me wrong. He, as the main character, is damn good. He's slick, tall, and handsome. Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, is brilliant. He demonstrates a better understanding of 'Matrix' and is serious, expressionless, and jubilant. The rest of the cast including Moss and Weaving produce fine performances.The Wachowski brothers do an outstanding job at directing this film. Relating Japanese style towards an American film. The Hollywood FHX in this film is ground-breaking and highly praise. Different camera angles are also used to shoot this film.It may seem surprising, but this film was ONLY acclaimed for it's visual effects. It deserved more, but didn't get any! Otherwise, this visual effects of this film are the highlight and the most related to Hollywood's biggest achievements. The different 'kung-fu' fights are so well done, that you have a great time with them. These effects also made this film look slick and extremely cool.Overall, you shouldn't be missing 'The Matrix' if you are fond of this genre. It exemplifies a perfect well-done thriller. An entertaining ride from start to finish, this is one of my favorite films.",9,2,4,4 May 2011
Gladiator," Gladiator: A breathtaking epic from Ridley Scott
","After a jubilant start to his career, I wasn't too impressed with Ridley Scott with his films. They sure were epic pieces, but they usually weren't masterpieces. I wanted to see something visually dazzling and also very good in every other aspect. Gladiator was a perfect example of that...This breathtaking epic was visually sophisticated, well-made, and brilliantly acted. Ridley Scott did an amazing job with the brutal battle scenes, scenery, and characterization. This is truly his best film.The performances are perfect and ravishingly powerful in every way. Russell Crowe simply took the daylights out of me with his outstanding performance as Maximus. The guy was literally born for the role! Joaquin Phoenix is creepy and mesmeric as the evil Commodus, remaining perfect the whole time. The rest of the cast is also great...Overall, Gladiator is probably the best medieval epic you'll ever see. This is mainly because of Ridley Scott's brilliant direction, the outstanding performances, and the Oscar-worthy battle scenes. A must-see that deserved all the Academy Awards it got!",9,1,4,18 March 2011
The Social Network," David Fincher's best film which guards his Oscar.
","The Social Network 'appeared' to be one of the most anticipated/profound films of the year, so my expectations for this film were high. The Facebook 'story' was a one I had actually never known about, and was extremely curious/interested to find out more. Lastly, with David Fincher, who had directed so many great and underrated films, you couldn't go wrong...To tell you, I wasn't a tad bit disappointed with the outcome of this film. It was actually almost perfect! It featured fine performances, a sophisticated soundtrack, brilliant writing, and outstanding direction.I wasn't expecting too much from young lads such as Eisenberg, Garfield, and Timberlake. In the end, they were all perfect for their roles. Eisenberg was strong, aggressive, and jubilant to show his hidden talent. Garfield was even more impressive; playing his character with speed, expressions, and perfection. Last but not least, Timberlake was actually the weakest. Yes he was aggressive and near-perfect for his role, but at times, he just blew it! The sophisticated soundtrack was creepy and made me shiver the daylights out of me! Reznor and Ross did an excellent job of putting it together.The writing was actually the 'stand-out', meaning the best category I praised this film for. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay seemed hard to follow, but the guy did one hell of a job! Overall, (as you can see), The Social Network is one of the best films of the year that guard Fincher's deserving Oscar. I'm just keeping my hopes up for him to get it, otherwise it'll be another foolish mistake from the harsh Academy.",10,1,2,18 March 2011
The Fighter," Wahlberg's big project exceeds thoroughly.
","Mark Wahlberg was never an acclaimed actor. Yes, he was brilliant in 'The Departed' and 'Boogie Nights', but otherwise he came in garbage films like 'Max Payne'. So, you can tell that he wanted the 'recognition' from the world and was a bit desperate to get a great script working. He came up with this film and thoroughly blew me away.'The Fighter' features captivating performances from Wahlberg, Bale, and Adams; and also captures the raw intensity of dysfunctional families and neighborhoods. David O. Russell makes an impressive turn with this film and leaves me mesmerized.The performances are captivating and powerful. Mark Wahlberg is highly focused as the main character of the film and keeps the show going. Christian Bale gives the probable best performance you'll see from him yet. Amy Adams is ferocious and aggressive (not afraid to take a stand). Supporting cast is fine too; Melissa Leo makes a surprising turn as the mother. She is arrogant, humorous, and near-perfect.The storyline is great and enough to keep you glued to the screen. Focusing on the certain culture and on-goings of a dysfunctional family are interesting, (if not thoughtful). The direction is also great, but not anything outstanding like the performances. Russell does a damn well job.Overall, this film is truly watchable and exceptionally one of the best films this year. The performances are highly appraisal; Wahlberg, Bale, and Adams deserve recognition from the harsh Academy. Just hope that the Academy don't make a stupid mistake.",9,1,2,19 March 2011
The Godfather," The Greatest American Film Ever Made
","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is perhaps the best gangster story ever told and the best film ever made. It's an enriching, engrossing, and evocative look into the criminal underworld in perspective of the Corleone family. This is also one of the rarest films to come out without any flaws. As far as it goes, The Godfather is literature for movie-goers and respectfulness for critics. It boasts legendary performances, excellent direction, a brilliant script, and a smooth, peaceful soundtrack.This film wouldn't have been this good if not for Marlon Brando's absolutely amazing performances as Don Vito Corleone. His character has gone down in history as one of the most sophisticated, yet graceful characters of Cinema. Brando is widely known today as the greatest actor that's ever lived. Al Pacino, is brilliant, if not perfect in this film. He plays Michael Corleone with a certain innocence, yet jealousy for all he's worth. This actor is also known as one of the best actors in the world. You would have to also thank an excellent supporting cast that includes people like Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Sterling Hayden.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is trustworthy and often rewarding, as he leads this film in the right direction. The sets and scenery are often beautiful and intriguing, which matches the silent tone of this film. Since this is set in very old periodic places, this is a great example of old New York and Italy. The greatest scene in this film involves only Brando and Corleone. It's a scene of such scope and emotions that it's hard to describe it.Even though this material is based on Mario Puzo's wonderful books, it's hard to notice it. The film is so fluent and straightforward, that it's hard to pick up any flaws or evident mistakes in this. The writing is nevertheless excellent and even though there's no narration, this film never leaves you bored.And last, the soundtrack by Nino Rota is quite something. It's a very smooth, soothing soundtrack that is based on Italian music. This is very original and never leaves you disappointed with itself.Overall, there's no doubt this is an examination of American classical Cinema. Completely flawless and highly recommended for any movie buff. If you haven't seen The Godfather, then I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse. See it and you will definitely adore it.",10,0,2,16 August 2011
