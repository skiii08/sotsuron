Walk the Line," Another story of Elvis
","The film «Walk the Line» is based on the true story of the life and formation of the American singer and songwriter, a key figure in country music of the 20th century, Johnny Cash.
I like starring actors in this film: Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.
The film reveals the history not only of his musical path with all the ensuing consequences, but also the history of child-parent relations and how they affected in adult life. Also here between the lines it is well read that there is true Christianity.
I can't say that I liked the movie. First of all, I can not understand why he was nominated for the award for best editing, because the first half of the film is mounted frankly bad, and all the sudden leaps in time and the complete absence of logic transitions spoil the impression. Well, personally for me, watching this movie was just as hard as reading the biography of Elvis Presley in 13 years. Perhaps for those who are well acquainted with the work of the singer and are involved in the time period, about which the film was shot - he will prove to be good. For me, this film is 'passing through'.
Of the positive points: Naturally, many moments were predictable. And what's new in a musician's life? But that's what pleased me, so this is the end of this story. Usually, such characters end their lives sadly and early. This is not a musical, but music is present here, in large numbers. And of course, a great acting, worthy of their awards and nominations for this film, was pleased.",4,0,1,5 May 2018
