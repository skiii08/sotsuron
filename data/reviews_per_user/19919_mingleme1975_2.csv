Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," funny, but...
","okay okay okay this is funny. anyone that disputes that is only half awake.yet I couldn't help wonder whether everyone in the film is in on the joke. who cares, you may ask, but well, I guess I do.I read that the town featured in the beginning had no idea what he was doing, but agreed to it anyway. no big deal, right? well to me, this affected the way I watched the show, as if the director and writer were willing to do anything for a laugh...including mislead people.like i said, there's funny stuff here for sure. And I doubt anyone enjoying this sort of think will care about the points I've raised.",6,1,1,10 October 2013
The Bourne Identity," take your gravol pills
","On the big screen, this movie made me sick.It wasn't the acting or the music, it was the camera work. It was like someone strapped the camera to their head, drank fifteen beers and then ran naked across a football field.Each stumble, makes the camera jerk left or right and my eyes roll back in my head. It was really hard to concentrate on seeing the eyes of the actors, because every time I would focus, the shot would start getting bumpy and I'd want to curl into a ball.The story is that there's a guy who can't remember who he is. But he knows he's someone...he just has to put the pieces together. In that sense, it's an enjoyable watch.",Null,0,1,10 October 2013
