Insidious: Chapter 2," Didn't set the mood from the last film
","Story sets off in a creepy, insidious way, but the build up gets ruined by a pop up of what seems to be a mentally disabled woman screaming 'how dare you' This ruins the whole ominous setting with a completely harmless lady, the rest of the story brings you back from the supernatural realm of creepiness, to discussing a transsexual serial killer, this turns the pace from the edge of your seat, to a dull mystery 'thriller' The original Insidious film was beyond human, it was demons and vague personifications of objects.The first word that comes to my mind to describe this dull, inconsistent horror would be letdown.Let me not deter you from watching this movie, but simply think of me as a warning to not get your hopes up when you're expecting a terrifying horror.",4,0,0,12 December 2013
