Hereditary," Genuinely unsettling
","This is a brilliantly crafted movie with outstanding performances. Horror is not my genre at all, and I don't scare easily, but this was a very tense and unsettling experience. Also, the soundtrack is quite extraordinary, so much so that I hung on for the credits at the end to see who the composer might be... The great Colin Stetson. Of course - I should have known! Loved it.",8,2,4,28 February 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," Preposterous plot, nice cinematography
","Am I going senile? I simply can't believe the reviews, awards and ratings that have been festooned on this movie. The plot: based purely on the fact that somebody looks somewhat shifty in an old photo, a murder suspect is identified. Er, OK you've lost me already. Where would we find this murder suspect? Why not pop along to the football stadium, we're sure to spot him in a crowd of only 20,000 or so. There he is! Quick! Now we have him in custody, let's get a confession out of him, we have 6 minutes. Done deal! Next! The relationships between the protagonists are frankly juvenile. The film is an insult to one's intelligence and if it had been made in USA starring - say - Bruce Willis, it would have been pure B list fodder.It's too long as well, and the music made me want to eat my own fingers. Nice cinematography though.",3,35,62,9 November 2010
BlacKkKlansman," Great story, very average movie
","I struggle with 'based on a true story' movies generally. The plot embellishments and/or complete inventions tend to discredit them for me to a lesser or greater degree.
This movie plods along, OK performances, pedestrian story-telling, badly paced.
I think the assumption was probably that the bizarre nature of the central plot would be enough to carry the film and wow us, the audience. It goes without saying that the message is vitally important. But the film doesn't do the subject matter justice, and just doesn't work very well. Not wowed at all.",3,5,10,26 February 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Half a great movie?
","Strong performances can't save this movie, which is excellent for the first hour then nosedives rapidly.
There's a definite farce element in the second half of the film and this may be deliberate, but it didn't work for me. And this main text of Forgiveness etc just doesn't sit well. The final chumminess between Hayes and Dixon for example was particularly toe-curling for me .And the black woman who is imprisoned simply to punish/leverage Hayes? Shes' very forgiving too. As is the guy who was beaten and thrown out of a window. His secretary/assistant didn't seem to mind being punched in the face either. 
Just a bit of silly plot really. Shame, could have been really great.",6,1,2,23 July 2018
The Revenant," Brilliant first 30 minutes, then go and grab a pizza somewhere...
","Spoilers! Lots of them!
The first half hour or so of this is totally rivetting, especially on the big screen.
The skirmish/battle scene is one of the best I've ever seen, genuinely terrifying, with the confusion and terror being perfectly rendered on the screen. 
And of course the bear attack, real edge of the seat stuff. 
The do yourself a favour and go home - you've had good value for you money, and if you stay you're about to waste two hours of your life.
What's wrong? It's just silly basically.
The ironically-named Mr Glass (he's indestructable, hence the irony) is so badly injured by the bear he can only move his eyes. Then he can just barely crawl through the woods. Then suddenly he's walking with the aid of a branch. Then he survives a near-freezing river experience without a sign of hypothermia. Then he's jumping on a horse's back. I can't do that and I'm really fit, no bear-mauling damage at all!
Next he has a magic musket. Muskets fire one shot. Then they have to be reloaded. But Mr Glass has acquired the world's first self-loading musket, because it seems able to fire at will, without requiring powder, shot, etc.
He rides of a cliff into the top of a tree then subsequently falls to the ground. No damage, obviously. Mr Indestructable! Then he climbs into the stomach of his dead horse to keep warm, the stomach I presume being around 6 feet or so in length. Gee that was a big horse!
Finally arrives at the fort, almost immediately goes back out to find his arch enemy Tom Grumpy Hardy. With one person accompanying him. Why? Why not 20 men? 
Next he props his shot dead pal on a horse (as a decoy) by putting a branch down the chap's jacket. Why doesn't the dead man simply fall of sideways, or slump off forwards or backwards? No idea. It's magic! 
I really wanted to like this movie, I like Leonardo di Caprio and also Tom Hardy, and the cinematography is good. But this is just daft, silly, an insult to one's intelligence. It's not a fantasy film after all.",2,1,1,26 February 2018
Wonder Woman," A travesty.
","This film is an abomination. Terrible script, clunky dialogue, stupid plot, frankly weird imagination by whoever concocted it. Who on earth and in what studio could have bought this idea?: er, let's take an iconic female super hero steeped in irony, pazazz, style and gender-subtext and plant her in a grey blood stained doom-laden first world war trench scenario where people are getting their arms and legs blown off, that is if they manage to survive the gas poisoning of course. How many grams must have been consumed at the studio planning sessions to come up with this drivel? My guess? Many. First principle here: make sure there can be one or more (preferably 3 or 4 or 5) sequels to the movie. And prequels of course. This is by far the most important thing. Dollars in abundance. Next, add 95% CGI. CGI cor! and wow! - how impressive. Is the year actually 2003 and I've over-slept? Dull dull dull. Look at our software, Clever innit? Next, recreate 'Indiana Jones...' but with a female lead. And in WW1 trenches!! With gas... Brilliant idea!!! Next: it's OK to slaughter literally hundreds of German soldiers, because obviously they were all nasty evil baddies and the Allies were all goody goody freedom fighters. (Er, sorry, but in reality the slaughtered - slaughtered by the film's 'heroes' - German soldiers would actually have been conscripts just like the Allied soldiers were. Doing what they were told). I really hope this movie does not become a history lesson/synopsis/precis to anyone, anywhere. Read some history books, quick. And, finally, to have the audacity to try to trowel on to this mess of a film some kind of humanitarian anti-war message??!! The final insult to one's intelligence in a long series of insults to one's intelligence. Seriously? Let's bring world peace by killing everybody who isn't in our team?? Ye gods. Ye Gods.... Words fail me. Next Superhero movie: Batman in Vietnam. Can't wait.",2,2,6,10 December 2017
