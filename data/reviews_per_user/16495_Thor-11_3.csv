The Blair Witch Project," Yikes!
","Say what you will about this movie...for instance, say that watching shaky shots of leaves on the ground gave you that headache right behind your eye...but don't say it wasn't scary.  That last image (you know the one I'm talking about) was burned into my brain for 24 hours after the film ended...brrrrr.  Anyone who says this movie wasn't scary probably accidentally walked into 'Muppets from Space' and only THOUGHT it was Blair Witch.  Hmmm...maybe that's not so likely.  Either way, see the movie, preferably on the small screen, definitely in the dark!",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
Fight Club," Sixth Sense with adrenaline!
","I love this movie so much...I only wish I could recommend it to anyone! Well, I can, but I have to know them pretty well...Ask yourself some questions...do you get queasy easily?  Do films ever leave emotional scars for you?  Or are you able to look at blood n guts?  If you can take it, see this movie...Like Edward Norton's character, when you see this movie you're asking someone to punch you as hard as you can, and it can make a profound impact. Some people may not enjoy this...",10,0,1,16 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Film for dummies?
","The bottom line is, this is not a work of art, in any capacity.  I enjoy Spielberg's work most of the time, especially in genres that people generally treat with disrespect, such as sci-fi (Jurassic, ET) and action (Indiana Jones movies), so I'm not some guy trying to put down a successful director.  And I'm not anti-patriotic by any means, either.  I just don't think it takes a movie with some blood to make me realize that war is bad.Good art has an implicit meaning, from which you can learn something.  This film has an explicit meaning, 'war is bad,' and all those who go out to see the big famous movie take for granted that it must be good, because it's about America and how war is bad, which is of course a very powerful message that younger people might not understand.  It's a sad fact that Americans don't understand art anymore, and the popularity of this trash is proof.",Null,0,0,9 February 1999
