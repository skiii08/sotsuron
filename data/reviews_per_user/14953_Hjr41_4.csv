Walk the Line," Burns
","This is an upsetting story about an even more upsetting man. With Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon completely inhabiting the respective roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter, and sure-handed direction from James Mangold, Walk the Line is an affecting drama that brings the legend of Johnny Cash to the screen in superior fashion. A deeply felt character piece that is beautiful and heartbreaking. James Mangold does exactly what you're supposed to do with this type of story. He shows you the reality, explains that reality, and never makes any excuses for it. He doesn't attempt to justify the shortcomings in the life of Johnny Cash, but he also doesn't pander by overly criticizing them. This is a movie that is justifiably angry at times, but is also tremendously empathetic. Beautiful stuff.",10,1,1,22 October 2017
Moulin Rouge!," Moulin Rouge
","Moulin Rouge is a tour de force of artifice, a dazzling pastiche of musical and visual elements at the service of a blatantly artificial story. Lumpish biopic, historically laughable as it pursues Hollywood's perennial view of the artist as solitary and star-crossed in both life and love. What taste can do, Huston does, abetted by Paul Sheriff's set designs and some fine colour camera-work from Oswald Morris. But playing Toulouse Lautrec on his knees, Ferrer could equally well be begging for mercy from the script. Best bit is the first reel, which evokes the spirit of Paris in the Naughty Nineties in a swirling mass of colour and movement.",10,1,2,22 October 2017
The Legend of 1900," a legend
","This is a large story told in a very small way. I liked it a lot but I really wish it had covered more of 1900's life as a whole instead of just the snippets we got. I would have liked to have seen more of how he lived on the ship such as reactions of others to him and his role. The set direction is very good and all the roles were cast great. I liked the performances and over all I thought the movie was sound.Probably the most nicest, saddest, cutest movie I've watched in ages! i was pleasantly surprised by this movie i thought it would be an alrite movie but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, its funny, great story line, well written, great cast, fantastic acting and includes Tim Roth looking hot and acting brilliantly!! the music soundtrack is also awesome and you can just fall in love with this movie! Its beautiful about an orphan who is left on a ship and taken in by one of the steam guys but after his unfortunate death Tim Roth gets into playing the oiano and becomes a sensation but hes never stepped of the boat and can he manage it when he falls in love?! Pruitt Taylor Vince tells the story of 1900 and revisits the ship but its about the blown up but is his friend still on the ship? A gorgeous movie completely worth a watch!!",10,1,2,22 October 2017
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Coen brothers have crafted another unique period piece.
","This is one of the strangest yet most satisfying movie experiences of the year, one of those films in which you can't really appreciate what you've seen until it's over. You just have to trust that the trip is worth the trouble. And it is. The broad, black humor of the Coens' early features has ripened over the years into a sadder, more philosophical brand of comedy (A Serious Man) that puts them in a class with Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch (yeah, you heard me).",10,2,3,22 October 2017
