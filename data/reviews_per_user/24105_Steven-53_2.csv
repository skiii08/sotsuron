"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," The true meaning of camp.
","This film is camp to the core, from the wonderful performances of convincing actors to catchy tunes and fantastic outfits! Since I first watched this film, I cannot resist slipping on a pair of platform shoes and belting out Abba lyrics into a hairdryer.You must see this film, or you'll never know what Guy Pearce looks like in drag!!!!",10,5,7,5 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," What an imaginative use of the word f***!
","How anyone can create a Broadway-style song using the word f*** is beyond me, but South Park has managed it! It's crude, shocking and totally offensive........but that is what South Park is made of! All the great characters are here (except Mr Hankey) and you even catch a glimpse of Kenny; beneath the coat! Big Al is gayer than ever and Cartman's mum is still a dirty s***. PLEASE GO AND SEE IT, you will not regret it.......that is providing you like South Park!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,0,6 September 1999
