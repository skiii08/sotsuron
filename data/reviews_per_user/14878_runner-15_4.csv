The Ring," Gave me Nightmares!
","(Maybe a small spoiler.) Wow, what else can I say? I have watched many horror movies over my 40 years of life from Hitchcock's great masterpiece `The Birds' To the some of the more recent Teen slasher movies prevalent recently. And in all that time I have never had a movie wake me the following night with Nightmares. This movie did exactly that! Whether it was the overall creepiness of the movie or the fact that it touched some dark fear buried deep in my subconscious I don't know, but the fact is after watching this movie last night I awakened four times to horrible nightmares three of which were directly connected to the movie. As I sit here today bleary-eyed writing this I think back to the house I grew up in which had an old abandoned cistern under it that our kitchen had been built over. I used to have a phobia as a child of falling through the kitchen floor into the depths of this black watery hole never to been seen again.  Maybe some of the scenes in this movie touched that long buried fear. On a creepy scale of 1-10 this movie is a 15!!!! Kudos to director Gore Verbinski for scaring the crap out of me! 8 out of 10 Stars.(2 star deduction for the ambiguous ending.)",8,3,5,27 October 2003
Pearl Harbor," How Sad
","Possible SpoilersYes that is my comment, but it is not a comment on Pear Harbor. It is a comment on the people who rip this movie to shreds.  How sad it is that many people have forgot that real people with real lives, real loves, real hopes, and real dreams fought and gave their life for them. I know this is a forum for reviewing movies and not a forum of debate. However after watching Pearl Harbor on DVD on a Big Screen TV last night with a good sound system all I can say is WOW! This has to be one of the great movies of recent memory, MUCH better in my opinion than Harry Potter could ever hope to be.So why is it so maligned by many of the posters here? Normally this might be considered attempting to start a debate but I feel that I am addressing real issues that have been brought up again and again by past posters in this forum.It's not historically accurate. HUH???   Please could someone point out one major historical inaccuracy. I consider myself to quite the history buff and can find no major inaccuracies in this movie. Omissions don't count as it is impossible to show every detail of an event on the big screen and not leave parts out. An omission is not an inaccuracy unless it changes the context of fact. Mr. Bay consulted closely with many people who were actually there and had their input and the input of many historians. My suggestion to those of you who believe this movie was inaccurate is, perhaps you should reexamine your knowledge of history from a more objective viewpoint.The love story was not important. The love story was the movie. This was not Pearl Harbor with the love story as a backdrop, this was a love story with Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid as a backdrop. War is about people. When you forget the people you forget the essence of what we fight and die for. Real people real lives, people loved people were separated people died and families and hearts were broken, that is war. War is not just one country fighting another country, for every person who dies in battle there is a story, a life and family. This movie was about those people. The love triangle was not believable. Another HUH??? This is a very believable situation. Often times a person who loses someone will turn to someone that is already close to both of them. I have seen this happen in real life. They both thought Rafe was dead. What is it more likely for Danny and Evelyn to do, forget each other or turn to each other?The special effects were poor. Once again HUH??? These were some of the best effects I have ever saw in a war movie.  The producers went to extremes to make the effects look real, even so far as actually loading real B-25 bombers onto a real aircraft carrier and recreating the start of the Doolittle Raid. This had never been done since the real Doolittle raid nearly sixty years ago.  Many of the shots include REAL aircraft and ships with CGI being used to only fill in the background. I believe some people have been watching  special effects so long they don't know real when they see it.In closing I say I loved this movie, and to those who hate this move, please watch it again with a open mind expecting a story of people and not a story of war.There was four of us who watched this movie last night and afterwards there was not a dry eye in the room.My rating 9 out of 10 (I've never Gave a 10)",9,0,1,6 December 2001
Stardust," A perfect movie
","I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Usually with any movie no matter how much I like it I can find some sort of fault. Sometimes it is minor sometimes major, usually it involves one of the lead characters doing something totally against logic sometimes it involves a unclosed subplot at the end. But this movie is perfect I can find nothing wrong with this movie. The director created one of the most incredible fantasy worlds ever shown on the big screen. And De Niro What can I say he was so wrong and so right at the same time. I would have never thought it was possible but he was so wrong for his part in this movie that he became the only right choice, absolutely beautiful.",10,6,8,11 August 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," One word is not enough WOW, WOW and WOW.
","That sums up my opinion of this great movie. I viewed this movie last night at the IMAX theater in Nashville TN, and was blown away. Burton and Depp have come together to remake a modern classic that is even better than the original. So many remakes go horribly wrong and pale in comparison to the original they are based on that you leave with a bad taste in you mouth. A few examples 'Rollerball', 'King Kong', 'Pyscho', and that attempt at remaking one of the worlds greatest comedy's 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' that was remade into that travesty 'Rat Race', even Mr. Burton himself had a horrible remake misfire with 'Planet of the Apes'. Other movies, such as 'Twelve angry men' and 'Godzilla' do nothing to improve on the original. This is NOT the case in this movie. This is one of the few examples where the remake is not only better, but Much better than the original. Mr. Burton has produced a movie that at first appears to move very slow, but suddenly before you realize it you are caught up in a whirlwind of sights and sound that passes far too quickly. Suddenly you realize all the bad children have disappeared right before your eyes and you have felt not one ounce of remorse for any one of them. (The only remorse I felt at this point was that the movie was nearing its end) But not quite Mr. Burton gives us an extended ending that is MUCH more satisfying than the original. Often times good movies end so quickly that you feel the same as you do after spilling your pumpkin pie on the floor after thanksgiving dinner. You had a great meal and are full but something is missing at the end. This is the way I felt after viewing the original, but this is not the case here, viewers are treated to a great movie with a VERY satisfying ending. A further note on the actors, every one in this movie gave a great performance that was fitting of their character, however top Kudos go to Johnny Depp and David Kelly for their performances as Willy Wonka and Grandpa Joe.And VERY special praise and Kudos to Mr. Deep Roy for his incredible performance as the Oompa Loompa. I have never been more impressed with one actor playing more than one character than I was with this.One last piece of advice; If there is an IMAX theater anywhere near you showing this movie, make the drive, the sights and sounds in this movie when blown up to super size makes an incredible impact on 3 of your 5 senses, Sight, Sound, Touch. (You can feel the rumble of the boat and the machines in the factory.) it is well worth the extra effort and admission.",9,0,2,27 July 2005
