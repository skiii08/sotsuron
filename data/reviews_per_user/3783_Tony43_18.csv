Changeling," A tale of abuse and corruption
","It's ironic that because of the 1950s TV drama 'Dragnet,' Los Angeles got the reputation of being a city with a squeaky clean, incorruptible police department. It's ironic because nothing could be further from the truth for much of the city's history.The 1920s and most of the thirties were particularly lawless decades for LA cops. LA was overflowing with gambling houses and bordellos all operating virtually openly. Cops were involved in one scandal after another, including a police chief caught during Prohibition in the back seat of a police car with a bottle of booze and a half naked hooker; vice squad cops caught up in a badger game targeting a city councilman; and the commander of the police intelligence division convicted of attempted murder in the bombing of the car of a special investigator for the grand jury looking into police corruption.One of the hardest incidents to comprehend was the 1928 disappearance of 9-year-old Walter Collins, and his return five months later thanks to the 'detective work' of the LAPD. That was a case that might have been completely forgotten by now but for one thing -- the boy's incredulous mother who took one look at the returning kid and said 'That's not my son!' What could have prompted the LAPD to substitute another kid for the missing boy? Awash in a constant stream of bad publicity, targeted by reformers and plagued by the fact that it was a department of thieves, thugs, and incompetents, the 1928 department under Chief James 'Two Guns' Davis was apparently desperate for any good publicity and returning a missing kid to his hard working, single mom seemed full proof. But for one thing: Mom was tougher than Davis and conducted a non stop crusade to uncover the truth and find her real son.Sadly, unfolding at the same time was the repugnant tale of a serial killer operating out of a chicken ranch in nearby Riverside county and how he was abducting and murdering young boys.All these elements --the Collins case, the police corruption story and the tale of the serial killer -- are expertly woven together by director Clint Eastwood into a movie that grows more interesting as it goes.Expertly cast and beautifully mounted (the art direction is a shoe in for an Oscar nomination)the film nonetheless lives or dies on the performance of Angelina Jolie, who plays the mom, Christine Collins. Many of Jolie's roles don't do much to test her acting chops, this one does and she more than meets the challenge, turning in a beautifully controlled performance that should get her another Oscar nod too.If I have a criticism, it is that the movie in the end gives the impression the corruption may have ended when Chief Davis was demoted following the Collins case. He was demoted, to head of the traffic division, but was made Chief again when Frank Shaw became mayor.Corruption at city hall and in the police department simply exploded and there were so many abuses by the central vice squad, the Intelligence Division and the 'Red Squad' of strike breakers and gun thugs that they eventually led to the 1938 recall of Mayor Shaw and a general house cleaning of the police department, which forced out Davis and more than 40 other high ranking officers.But see the movie. This one is certainly worth seeing.",9,29,45,30 October 2008
Stop-Loss," Compelling, but not necessarily satisfying
","-----------------------------spoiler alert -------------------- Kimberly Peirce's first film since 'Boys Don't Cry' tackles a big topic, maybe one that is too big for any director to attempt to cover in a single film. The irony is, she accomplishes her goals in terms of making a riveting movie, but perhaps fails in efforts to truly illuminate as complex an issue as the war in Iraq.The plot is that Army sergeant Ryan Phillippe, a veteran of both the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns, finds out on the day he is mustering out of the Army that he is being stop lossed, meaning sent back involuntarily for another combat tour in Iraq.But plot holes develop almost as quickly as he finds himself conscripted in what he refers to as a back door draft.The first problem is that he immediately jumps the tracks and goes AWOL, when his carefully crafted image from the early parts of the movie show him to be a thoughtful, highly responsible soldier. Yes, he might eventually break the rules and jump ship, but not immediately and the film would have been even more interesting if he'd fought his situation through legal channels before deserting.From there, a lot of the film deals with another problem, the post traumatic stress syndrome he and his small town Texas buddies are facing, in his case, largely because he led his men into a rather obvious ambush while in Baghdad, a trap that got his best friend killed and others wounded.From there, the film deals with his life on the run, ironically with the ex-fiancé of another of his buddies, and that life affords a look at the white working class background upon which America's all volunteer Army is now built. While a little clichéd, it does remind us that there are tens of thousands of troops from that very background, many of whom seem to know or understand almost nothing about the war they have volunteered to fight.______________________spoiler-------------------------- In the end, Phillippe's character turns himself in and winds up climbing aboard the bus that is the first step on the road back to Iraq. The trouble with the scene is it comes as a shock and its hard to know whether the filmmaker was saying Philippe was wrong all along, or that the average guy is just no match for the pressures being a good, dutiful American place on a young man.Its sort of like Congress getting a clear mandate from voters in November of 2006 to end the war, but doing virtually nothing about it, because Democrats don't have the votes to overcome a Republican veto and then take the heat that would follow.Whatever the message, it seemed to me to be a somewhat muddled one, and there is not much resolution to the story, as what it gives us is an ending that would have been more powerful had it come down hard on one side of the issue or the other.Still, this film in all fairness works as a movie up to the end and I would not stay away just because it falls down there.",Null,1,4,9 April 2008
Juno," the sum is less than its parts
","This is a well produced, well directed, well written and extremely well acted film. Its essentially a one woman show, and Ellen Page becomes a star with this picture, or at least she should.So why am I not jumping on the bandwagon? Its a game played with a stacked deck and that turns out to be its downfall.Juno is a 16 year old high school girl who gets pregnant after a single sexual encounter with her boyfriend of sorts, Paulie. Does Juno panic? Not on your life. Juno is smart as a whip, adventurous and once she decides to have the baby, she sets out on her own to find proper adoptive parts. The first family she visits turns out to be a rich yuppie couple who seem fine and they strike a deal. After a few doubts, Juno winds up having her baby and turns the child over to the rather rigid and somewhat frigid Jennifer Garner, who probably takes the kid right home and registers him for the right pre-school.The problem with this whole thing is that Juno encounters virtually zero problems along the way. She is not kicked out of school or ostracized by her classmates, her parents are supportive, the boyfriend doesn't disappear on her and the adoptive couple, while facing their own problems, don't turn out to be too bad.So essentially, what we have is the after school special about teen pregnancy, or one of a thousand Lifetime channel stories on the same topic, but minus most of the conflict. Its also minus what seems to me to be the real life emotion 16 year old girls would go through if this happened to them, and any of the self doubt that goes with the decision to give up their baby.Lastly comes the question of whether any sixteen year old would be as self assured and well rounded as this girl? It's possible, but rare.As such, the picture is worth seeing for Page's performance, but Juno is not exactly what you'd call high drama.",Null,98,161,20 December 2007
Match Point," More of a double bagel
","Only tennis fans will get that line, but then this film uses tennis, both as a minor plot point, and as a metaphor for life's unique twists and turns. In fact, the whole premise of this film is that so much of what happens to us happens by complete chance that it is much better to be lucky than good, a phrase no small number of tennis players and commentators have used over the years.'Match Point,' Woody Allen's new film, has gotten hailed by some critics as a return to form and by others for breaking new ground, at least for Woody. Writing for once not about neurotic Manhattanites, Allen this time has moved his serious comedy of manners to England, where it belongs. The plot, in a nutshell is this, failed and somewhat lazy tennis pro Chris Wilton, through a number of strokes of luck, falls in with a very wealthy family that takes a shine to him. Before long, he's headed to the alter with the family's pretty, charming, but slightly patronizing daughter, and also on his way to a new career as a pampered corporate executive, although exactly what business he is in never seems to be spelled out.That's pretty much the story for the first half of the movie, nothing but dumb luck taking the tennis pro, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, to the top, at least of the corporate rankings. Where things start to get sticky is when he falls for the girlfriend of the son of the family, an American actress named Nola. He even has a one afternoon stand with her, boffing her in a wheat field of all places in the middle of a heavy rain storm. But he goes ahead and marries the rich girl anyway, but then his brother-in-law dumps Nola and Chris finds himself obsessed with her. That leads to lies, deceptions and the finally, a major crime and then some.First, lets deal with the acting. Rhys Meyers is fine as the ex-tennis pro, although not exactly dynamic. But then, his part doesn't call for it. Had he been depicted as the poor boy from Ireland who fought and maneuvered and clawed his way into the upper ranks of London society, it would have been a much more interesting film. Instead, he's depicted as a guy who was too lazy for the travel and hard work of the ATP tennis tour, so he becomes a teaching pro and the world just becomes his oyster. Again, that's the premise of the film and it might even be true in some rare cases, but it is not particularly exciting to watch on screen. It's also all been done better before, specifically in George Stevens version of 'An American Tragedy,' which was released about 1950 as 'A Place in the Sun.' In 'Match Point,' there is nobody to cheer for, because the central character is not only a less than admirable character, but he's also basically a reactive, rather than an active character. Luck may exist, but it isn't all that interesting to watch as it unfolds.Supporting character Mathew Goode is good and Emily Mortimer in some ways delivers the best performance of the film as Chris' spoiled rotten, wife. Then comes the matter of the highly talented Scarlett Johansson as Nola, the American actress who for some unexplained reason, thinks London is the center of the film world. Even after being dumped by her boyfriend, she keeps coming back to England. Never mind New York, or, dare we say the word, Hollywood, she thinks all the acting jobs are in England.Johansson delivers one of her weakest performances in this film, starting off fairly strong, but playing the same note throughout the film. And when you think about it, her cynicism never really rings true from the beginning. Why would a girl about to marry into such a wealthy family be so negative all the time. Couldn't an actress do a little more to win over the skeptical mother-in-law? ********************spoiler alert*****************Then comes the big finish, in which Chris, who has had a torrid affair with Nola, finds out she is preggers and is about to blow his cover. So he shotguns both her and her neighbor to death and tries to make it look like a burglary gone bad. No, you didn't misread this. That's what happens. And as improbable as that is, the story gets worse. The subsequent police investigation of a particularly brutal double homicide quickly clears Chris. Even though there is enough evidence to make this a case right out of Detective 101, the cops just let him go. Apparently in London, no autopsies are performed on the bodies of murder victims, which of course would have shown that Nola was pregnant and of course, Chris was the main suspect. Secondly, even after he admits to the police he was having an affair with Nola, they never ask about his alibi for the time of the crime nor apparently make any effort to check it out.I would guess the Bobbies never solved a murder case, which must come as something of a surprise to every English detective from Sherlock Holmes to Robbie Coltrane's character in 'Cracker.' At any rate, I don't think Woody Allen is back and I don't think he made his case for everything being all about luck. I didn't feel lucky wasting my time in this film.",Null,5,12,31 December 2005
The Grapes of Wrath," Torn from today's headlines?
","As I write this, there has been rioting in the streets in Argentina and Brazil, rioting by the African and middle eastern immigrants in France and here in the US, tens of thousands of the poor remain displaced from their homes following Hurricane Katrina. A line from one of the best films of the year, 'Secuestro Express,' sums up perfectly all these people's common problem.'Half the world suffers from malnutrition, the other half from obesity.' Even though it was made 65 years ago, 'The Grapes of Wrath' is still relevant today, for the grinding poverty depicted in this film and the struggle to overcome it --in some cases just to survive it --remains today the all consuming battle for a large portion of the world's population.We should not forget just how controversial John Steinbeck's novel was when it was first published all those years ago. Called socialist propaganda by politicians and branded a pack of lies by the big California farmers, the book went on to achieve great acclaim. Yet it and stories like it will always be lightning rods for controversy because they dare to suggest that what separates the halves and have not's is not always just how hard people are willing to work. Some of those who work the hardest --and there may be no harder work than stoop labor --wind up with the least.Plenty of good hard work went into the motion picture version of this story of Dust Bowl immigrants of the 1930s trying to start a new life in California.The film, of course, was the work of some of the best in Hollywood. Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, one of the industry's greatest producers, adapted for the screen by Nunally Johnson (Jesse James), photographed by Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane); staring one of the screen's greatest actors, Henry Fonda, backed by a remarkable cast of character actors including Jane Darwell and John Carradine, and helmed by a candidate for the honor of Hollywood's greatest director, John Ford, this film was assembled like a fine Swiss watch, which is probably why it continues to tick today, well over half a century later.Ford was at the top of his game when he undertook the project and its brimming with his unmatched visuals, thanks to the camera-work of Gregg Toland. From the opening shot of a solitary figure walking down a highway towards a diner, to shots of the Joad family, piled in their jalopy truck, passing through an Indian reservation in New Mexico, to the film's signature shot, as they wind their way through a transient camp outside Bakersfield, California, Ford and Toland use the camera to advance the idea that these are people on an odyssey, a search for a better life in a sometimes beautiful, but often hostile environment. Many directors are capable of making pretty pictures. Ford proves in 'Grapes of Wrath' that you can tell a compelling story without a word being spoken.But like all great movies, from Murnau's 'Sunrise' to Coppola's 'Godfather,' this film is about a lot more than pretty pictures. The movie's words are powerful and haunting and resonate today. When John Qualen, playing the deranged sharecropper, Muley, describes how the Oakies have been pushed off their land by the banks; or when David Hughes playing a discouraged immigrant coming back from California empty handed, gives his dire warning about the perils the travelers face, you cannot help but be moved. And of course, there is Henry Fonda, who delivers his now legendary speech at the movie's end, as he sets out on his own to see what can be done about the plight of the poor. The screen may have never produced a better piece of dialog.'The Grapes of Wrath' continues to stand today as a landmark of American movie making and a film well worth the time of anyone who wants to try to understand what for much of mankind remains the most important struggle --the struggle for survival..",Null,3,6,7 November 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," Mary Tyler Moore for the new millennium
","I reluctantly went to see this film, but came away very glad I did. While in many ways very much the 'chic flick, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is more than just a pretty picture.The plot is pretty simple. Andy, a recent college graduate, manages to land a dream job as number two assistant to the editor of the top women's fashion magazine in the country. Andy, played smoothly and appealingly by Anne Hathaway, is smart, resourceful and has a kind of quiet self confidence that allows her to be good at her job, even for the most part brushing aside the highly negative comments from her coworkers, most of which center around the fact that she does not dress up to their standards. But with the help of a mentor, art director Stanley Tucci, she is able to tap into all the free clothes left around there after photo shoots and winds up looking like she stepped out of Vogue every time she steps out of the house. (Okay, that does stretch things a little, as obviously the clothes would be recognized by the other girls, who would probably whine about why they didn't get the same treatment.) The big conflict here? Andy's boss makes Mary Tyler Moore's Mister Grant look like Mother Teresa. Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, is truly the boss from hell. She is the kind of officer who gets fragged by his own men on the battlefield. But, to the film's credit, she is also portrayed as smart, exceptionally good at what she does, and a person quickly able to spot a phony a mile away.Streep gives an Academy Award winning performance here and no doubt will get a nomination. Her work is exceptional, when you consider that in her other big hit of the year, 'A Prairie Home Companion,' she plays a small time country western singer and pulls that role off with equal success.**************spoiler alert**************** While the film does in fact feature lots of nifty clothes for the women to ogle, it does go more than skin deep,for Andy slowly but surely finds herself sacrificing her life to this 24-7 job she has taken on, eventually losing her live in boyfriend and most of her friends, too.And in the film's most controversial twist, she decides in the end, after watching Miranda lose her third husband in a row, that the job just isn't worth it. So, Andy symbolically throws her cell phone into a fountain and walks out -- on the limousines, the trips to Paris, the potentially big salary and the chance to rub shoulders with the rich, the famous and the well dressed.Would this happen in real life? Maybe, but probably not. And when Meryl Streep whines that if she were a man, nobody would complain about the long hours she works, she may be mouthing feminist rhetoric, but not being truthful. The fact is, lots of wives complain about the very same thing, when their husbands are the ones who are never home or always missing the kids birthday parties. The fact is, people of both genders sacrifice their personal lives to achieve success in their careers.Perhaps the biggest lesson of the film is found in Stanley Tucci's character, who is promised a major job with a new concern, only to be screwed over in the end because of Miranda's need to maneuver a rival into that job to protect her own position at the magazine.That is probably the real lesson of this film. Even if you are very good at your job and even if you do work 24-7 and sacrifice everything for your career, there is no guarantee that some superior will not screw you over, because of his or her personal agenda or maybe do it just on a whim.Unfortunately, all the pretty clothes and glamour of this film may conceal that important part of the message.",Null,1,2,15 July 2006
Wanted," Mindless mayhem
","This is apparently a screen version of a comic book or a video game, the kind of junk that's turning the minds of young Americans to mush. The plot is that an everyman unhappy with his boring life gets a chance to become an over trained assassin and kill a lot of people, in part to avenge the murder of his father, even though he never knew the old man. That's about all the plot there is here. Charcterization? That's pretty much missing, too. The male star is forgettable because he is almost completely devoid of personality. But he fits right in at the DeCaprio, Toby McGuire school of wimps as heroes.Morgan Freeman non-acts his way through the number three staring role.That leaves the woman upon whom box office success rests ---Angelina Jolie. She flashes a couple of smiles, but mostly just hangs around looking enigmatic. Actually, her part could have been played by almost anyone, but she played it, so she is responsible for fostering this non stop exercise in teaching kids violence.She should be ashamed of herself. She is capable of so much more.I wanted my eight bucks back when this one was over, but I can never get back the two hours of my life wasted on this mess.",Null,10,25,27 June 2008
The Battle of Algiers," Should be mandatory viewing for every American
","'Battle of Algiers' is simply one of the greatest films every made.  If film making can be about truth as well as fantasy, then a movie that includes a title card telling viewers that there is not one foot of documentary or newsreel footage in it must deserve viewing.'Battle of Algiers' contains scenes that seem so real, you suspect that they couldn't have been staged.  When three Algerian women come down from the Casbah to plant bombs in the French quarter of the city, you can almost cut the tension with a knife.  When the bombs go off, you think they must have been real bombs.  And when you see the devastation they leave in their wake, you cannot fail to be moved.  The massive rebellion in the streets at the end of the film also seems so real, you sit wondering how many extras must have been injured filming those scenes.'Battle of Algiers' combines brilliant photography, crisp direction, an intriguing plot and some very fine acting. Throw in a terrific music score, splendid editing, impressive special effects and the best example ever of docudrama style production and you have a masterpiece of film making.But film making is not nearly as important as human life and no film in general release today says more about America's current involvement in the middle east and many other parts of the world than this picture about the French in Algeria, made more than three decades ago.Every American should view this film, then think about our current occupation of Iraq.",Null,218,260,30 January 2004
Van Helsing," Bloody bore
","There really isn't too much good to say about this flick. The action was virtually non stop, so non stop that it made this two hour film seem to be four hours long. It would have worked a little better if a little more thought had gone into things like story development and PACING.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale acquit themselves well, for what they get to do, which is damn little.Richard Roxburgh, who plays Dracula does not, coming off as rather bland in comparison to the two men most associated with Vampire roles. Call him camp if you will, but Bela Lagosi did a much better job and so did Chistopher Lee. They both had personality enough to make them interesting antagonists. This vampire was more a copy of one of those super villains that populate James Bond movies. He was never believable, nor particularly interesting. A guy whose only goal is to suck the blood out of you so he can go on living turns out to be far more interesting than a meglamanic who wants to rule the world. Who woulda thunk it? The answer is, anyone who understands drama would have.But the James Bondian villain angle leads to the big problem with this film and so many other big budget Hollywood films these days. When you lay out $170 million or something to produce and market a film like this, you try to cover your bets and I guess the best way to do that these days, beyond the computer graphics and the over hyped sound track, is to copy things that have been successful before.So they dreamed up this Ven Helsing guy (actually stolen from old Universal monster movies) and copied his character from James Bond movies. They copied the opening sequence from the original 'Frankenstein' film (but tried to pawn it off as a loving tribute). They copied the three flying wives of Dracula from just about ever World War Two war movie ever made in which Japanese Zeros attacked a defenseless village. They copied the the chamber where the baby Draculas were incubating from the 'Alien' movies.They probably copied a lot of the action from other current movies, but I rarely go to see them, so I can't cite the source.But from what I can figure, the largest budget item in the production package must have been for tracing paper, because they copied an awful lot.They didn't spend much on the script though, because there was virtually zero character development. Of course, these stories don't exactly revolve around character development. They are pretty much targeted at a poorly educated, over stimulated youth market that drifts from one cheap thrill movie to another week after week. And Marx thought religion was the opiate of the people!Overall, this one was a big waste of time. Go back and look at those old Universal monster movies and you'll have a much better time.",Null,0,1,18 May 2004
The Illusionist," Lacks magic
","This is a passable period piece, a film set around the turn of the last century in Vienna. Its about the star crossed romance between a Duchess and a poor boy who makes good on the stage as a magician. Its nicely mounted,well directed by Neil Burger and mildly engaging.But it could have been a much better film, if it had undergone a serious rewrite, been better cast and had its feel good, montage ending reedited.The core of the story is the illusionist played blandly by Edward Norton. While glib on stage and good under pressure, he is nonetheless a nondescript magician without any engaging character traits. He is neither a tortured mystic struggling to cope with his powers, nor a skillful conman using his talents to make a killing duping audiences. He's simply a quiet success. Too quiet. He is not a larger than life character and that seriously hurts the entertainment value of the film, for he seems to be a man with no major motivations, no big goals he's trying to achieve. He doesn't even seem all that fascinated with his magic.Seeing him in blandness and raising him is Jessica Biel as the Duchess. She is beautiful, but about as uninvolved a princess in an ivory tower as you will see in a film. Her big scene in which she breaks up with the abusive Austrain prince she is engaged to is almost unbelievably dull.The lone exception to the blandness rule that controls this film is Paul Giamatti, who plays a Vienna police detective fascinated with Norton's magic tricks, but forced by politics to play ball with the demented prince.Giamatti goes in the other direction, mugging for the camera at every opportunity, and actually almost going into a parody mode at the end of the film as he 'figures it all out.' For a hint about how to play the important third party --especially if he is a detective -- see Edward G. Robinson's performance in 'Double Indemnity.'The film is not without merit, and the action moves the picture along with few dead spots. Nonetheless, you can't help feeling that this is a picture about magic that lacks magic, both literally and symbolically.",Null,13,24,25 August 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A good civics lesson, but only a fair movie
","I have a feeling most of the critics of 'Good Night and Good Luck' are going to come from the political right --those who think it is part of the long liberal tradition of bashing Joe McCarthy, who is dead and gone and cannot defend himself. I take a slightly different stance. I'm somewhat critical of the movie, and I think McCarthy deserved everything he got in life and more, much more. My problem is not with the movie's politics, but with its film-making.First, let's mention the good stuff. George Clooney does a solid job as director, keeping the pace swift, the performances universally good and ringing everything he can ring out of the camera and the editing equipment. He makes lots of use of quick cuts and dramatic camera angles, all of which flatter the players and heighten the tension.And Clooney does an excellent job as actor. I have to admit I was skeptical when I heard he was playing Fred Friendly, but he pulls the part off and then some and you are able to forget he is a handsome Hollywood leading man and accept him as a behind the scenes administrator.Full marks, too, to the ensemble cast including Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Junior and Jeff Daniels, and especially to Frank Langella, who pulls off his 'William Paley' role with ease.What of David Strathairn in the pivotal role as Edward R. Murrow? I have long been a Strathairn fan (especially in all those John Sayles movies) and think he gives it everything he's got. But he finds himself in the tough position of playing an historic character who is too fresh in our minds. He has neither the physical presence nor the timber of voice of Murrow and I kept flashing back on the real life CBS icon, which distracted from me paying attention to the actor up there on the screen. Whether those not overly familiar with the real life Murrow will face this problem or not, I don't know.But it is those not so familiar with Murrow and this particular chapter of American history who I feel were short changed the most. And that was because of a thin script, the place where George Clooney, co-screenwriter, fell down.The problem for me is that the movie failed to establish the era and the stakes involved in this battle of wills in the early days of television. The film does have a brief opening prologue, which quickly crawls up the screen as it tells about the influence McCarthy was having and the fear he struck in people's hearts.But that's sort of like saying Attila the Hun was a rowdy house guest. What the film needed to do was to show the impact red baiting had on America from the end of WWII until the mid-50s. It needed to talk about the HUAC hearings, the Hollywood black list, the government purges, the spy trials, the fear of the bomb, the raging debate over 'who lost China,' the suicide in '49 of former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, all these things created a climate of fear which had a strong impact on the nation, and which led to the rise of McCarthyism.While a movie is NOT a history lesson, this is a movie about history being made and the audience, especially those not around when this was all going on, needs to understand the stakes that were involved here. There was even fear in the 50s that McCarthy was maneuvering himself into a position where he'd either have to be given a cabinet post or Eisenhower would have to put him on the GOP ticket in 1956. Luckily, Ike, no matter how much he disliked Nixon, had even greater disdain for McCarthy, who he looked upon as something of a dangerous demagogue, if not a cheap thug.All these things could be told, either in fast paced news clips or newspaper headlines of the day at the beginning of the film, or mixed in later, anything to raise the stakes in this film.What could have also been used was drawing a contrast between Murrow's celebrated service as a war correspondent in London, and 'Tailgunner Joe's' self proclaimed heroics on bombing missions.Some or even any of this might have added drama to the story, as would a few words about how McCarthy came to be censored by the Senate, what happened to him and to the perpetually cigarette smoking Ed Murrow.Whether or not George Clooney had the budget to add another ten minutes to the film, I don't know. But those ten minutes could have lifted a good film into the realm of greatness. As it is, the film fails to live up to the importance of the events it is depicting.",Null,8,18,7 October 2005
The Da Vinci Code," So, God was NOT my copilot?
","Despite reports of bad reviews, I didn't find this one nearly as hard to take as I expected. That's not to say it is any Hitchcockian masterpiece, either, although it has a Hitchcock feel to it in places.It is a slick, well directed, well produced Hollywood thriller/potboiler that, after an excruciatingly long opening sequence in the Louvre, is off and running, running so fast at times that it is hard to keep up with.Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou star as two people on a quest to find the Holy Grail (so to speak) and Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina and Jean Reno, among others, play the bad guys dedicated to keeping them from their goal.While the acting is uniformly solid, and the direction crisp, the film takes a good deal of suspension of disbelief for it to work, not in accepting the premise, but in making peace with the rich collection of murderous bad guys menacing the hero and heroine. Of particular note is Paul Bettany as an albino monk turned hit man who, when he is not trying to murder people, engages in naked self flagellation, apparently to atone for sins past, present, and presumably future. He was probably not intended to exactly provide comic relief for this story, but he is always just one step away from pure parody. In fact, in some ways he would have fit in better in a Mel Brooks movie and you can almost count on his being roasted on Saturday Night Live.I have never been much of a Tom Hanks fan and he did little in this film to up my opinion of his work. Although saddled with an under written part, he failed to do much with what he was given and I never had any real reason to become emotionally involved with him. Over the years, many actors, from Jimmy Stewart to Gregory Peck to Joseph Cotton have played Americans caught up in intrigue in a foreign land and made us feel much more for them. Hanks went nowhere in my view. Audrey Tautou, not my favorite French actress by a long way, was also a little wooden.Finally, there is the controversial content of this film, which does deserve being addressed. You would have to have just emerged from a time capsule if you didn't already know the 'secret' before you watched this movie. So this was a film about process --how the mystery unfolds and how the protagonists go about solving it. And the only part of that mystery we didn't know in advance was the role Audrey Tautou played in it and I guessed her hidden significance almost immediately.Which leads us to the theology. There was little in this particular theory of Christianity that I had not heard before, even though I have not read the book.Yet I can understand how Christians would be offended by this one, since the basic premise implies Jesus was NOT god after all. But why his 'marrying' or even just having dated Mary Magdalene would prove he was not god is never really explained. If you believe in the concept of god, then god could probably marry anyone he wanted. He could probably set the rules, too. ( 'No, I am not helping with the dishes or taking out the garbage and if I want to go out one night a week with my buddies....' Well, you get it.) Also of concern to me is the number of murders churchmen are seemingly willing to commit here and who is behind them. The film seems to say they are the work of a 'rogue' group of clerics within the church. Oh, yeah, we've heard about those Black Ops groups before. And I assume their role is to give the Vatican plausible deniabilityLastly, and this is the part that bothers me the most,is the sort of feel good ending dreamed up here, an ending that takes great pains not to come down on either side of the theological argument. Was Christ god or not? Tom Hanks' character tells us it doesn't matter, because he was a great profit no matter what. Hello? Try telling a couple of billion Christians it doesn't matter. Hell, tell Pat Robertson, Jerry Farwell, Doctor James Dobson and the rest of the Looney tunes who populate the airwaves that Christ was actually NOT god after all. Oops, our bad, they will say. All you guys we condemned to hell. You can come back up now.Overall this one makes for some good moments, but it is not a movie you want to examine too closely, when unfortunately, its premise requires, no virtually commands close scrutiny.A marginal thumbs up, but more for the direction than any other element.",Null,0,3,19 May 2006
The Departed," Well done, to a point
","There is little doubt that Martin Scorsese is one of the finest directors currently at work in America. Pictures like 'Raging Bull' and 'Goodfellas' established him as a master of the art. There is also evidence that, like the gangsters and heist artists he sometimes depicts on the screen, Scorsese is always looking for that one big score, the movie that will put him on easy street. He searched for it in 'Cape Fear' and 'Gangs of New York' and he's back in the hunt again with 'The Departed.' Scorsese's talent and craftsmanship cannot be disputed. He has the amazing ability to create a milieu, a textured background, fill it with interesting people and events and weave them all together. And despite his less than successful forays into other genres, he usually comes off best when he sticks to the genre that made him famous, the gangster flick. Scorsese may hate gangster films for all I know, just as James Cagney did before him, but he is smart enough to realize they are his bread and butter.But like so many directors today, Scorsese is trapped in an industry that focuses so much on the youth market, in today's world, a poorly educated youth market that is swimming in media excess. This is the age, not of information, but rather of too much information. This is an age where movies and TV are more influenced by the computer screen than any other force in society. And as most of us know, computers have to have some type of information occupying ever square inch of the screen. So today, TV shows may have opening credits at the bottom of the screen, but they are often overlaid with promos for the show coming up next, even though the viewer isn't even into the current show yet. And since the information is overlaid, you actually can't read either, much less pay attention to the picture on the screen.Up on the big screen, directors like Peter Jackson can make a horrible mess of his remake of 'King Kong,' by filling the screen with so much action the film is hard to follow. Don't have the big gorilla fight one T-Rex dinosaur, have him fight three of them, while falling down a bottomless pit and trying to save the girl at the same time.The fear that letting up for even a second will lose this short attention span audience is slowly strangling the entertainment industry.'The Departed' falls into this trap. It moves along with the speed of light and even though I found myself checking my watch when we'd crossed the two hour mark, I still enjoyed the movie.Then came the ending.Not only did one bad guy meet his maker, they all did. Even people who we didn't know were bad guys died in a hail of bullets. I almost expected the final scene to be somebody pulling out a gun and committing suicide, adding their own body to the pile.Whether all this carnage was needed, or whether Scorsese just thought that's what kids wants these days, we will never know.Does the film work, yes. Would I recommend it? Yes, but only with the warning that it contains much bloodshed and too much action for most of us to easily follow the plot.Is the acting good? Mostly, yes. Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon are good in lead roles, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin and particularly, Mark Walberg are good in supporting roles and actress Vera Farmiga provides some very welcome relief as the love interest, if only in that her scenes provide some of the few moments of calm in this frenetic story.What about Jack? Nicholson ranges from brilliant to just plain Jack, an actor who is basically playing himself and done it so many times he is now almost a parody of himself.Is the story credible? Hard to say. It is supposedly adapted from an Asian gangster film. It provides a look into the Irish mob in Boston and thus seems to be fashioned in part on the career of Whitey Bulger, a Boston mob leader who was also an FBI informant and who is still a fugitive.Lastly, I have one question for the director. Why did he call his fictional crime boss Frank Costello, naming him after a very real Italian-American crime lord once known as the Prime Minster of the Underworld. Costello was probably the most powerful mobster in America during the 1940s and early fifties. He was a dapper dresser and soft spoken hood who lived at the Waldorf Astoria, frequented the Stork Club, and, since he was top man in 'the outfit' which reached from New York to New Orleans, Miami to Los Angeles, he probably very rarely turned up in warehouses in the middle of the night where he could get caught in the middle of shady deals. He went to prison, alright, but for what they eventually got most of the big hoods on, a tax rap.",Null,0,0,18 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Spectacular downer
","It's hard to describe this movie. In many ways, it's the most amazing special effects parade I have ever seen. Spielberg proves he is the best director in the world at putting together the big scene with lots of action in it.And he certainly captures the mood perfectly.Where the picture falls down, in my view, is the extensive subplot, which seems ripped right out of a made for TV movie on the Lifetime Channel. Divorced dad Tom Cruise may be caught up in the end of the world, but at least he gets to spend some quality time with his children. Big hugs all around! The acting is OK, although just once I would like to see Cruise play someone other than his stock, 'cocky guy who gets religion in the end' character. But the ironclad rule of the Hollywood character arc seems to dictate that Cruise always be that guy in one form or another.Aside from my complaints about him, there is the matter of Dakota Fanning. She screams a lot and when not screaming, is busy being a TV character. Is it impossible for Hollywood to create a child character who talks and acts like a kid and not a smart ass sitcom character? Lastly, my problem with this movie is that it is a very dark, not very pleasant story to watch. I was dazzled. I'll admit that. But I didn't have a good time and I have no desire to see this film again, where as I have seen the 1950s George Pal version of 'War of the Worlds' many times and as corny and crude in terms of effects it is, its a much more fun film to watch. But for more fun on the sci fi level, see Howard Hawks 1951 film 'The Thing' or the British 'Five Million Years to Earth' or Don Siegel's original 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.' All much more enjoyable exercises in movie going.",Null,0,2,7 July 2005
The Good Shepherd," An important movie that only partly accomplishes its mission
","Robert DeNiro's 'The Good Shepherd' may or may not be an accurate look at the early days of the CIA. But it deserves a chance with movie goers because it does at least make an effort to tear the veil away from America's mostly secret intelligence community.The story that it tells centers around a young man played by Matt Damon who is recruited for the spy agency right out of college just before the onset of WWII and follows his career, though flashbacks, up through the Bay of Pigs fiasco.While the film works well as history, it is less successful as a piece of cinema because of some choices it makes. One assumes the 'Good Shepherd' title is supposed to describe a selfless individual who sacrifices his personal happiness for the good of his country. In order to do this, he pretty much walls himself up emotionally. Such could be one of the realities of the spy business, but unfortunately, watching an emotionally constipated man slog through a nearly three hour movie is not necessarily the most exciting of experiences.One wonders, in fact, if you could have told the exact same story, but made the fictional protagonist a lot more demonstrative. After all, Damon's character is not a field operative lurking in shadows most of the time. He's a desk jockey supervising the people who lurk in the shadows.His lack of emotions does play out as part of the story line, and his long suffering wife, well played by the beautiful Angelina Jolie, finds marriage to this guy a less than fulfilling experience. Actually, this is an angle that is much too underplayed, and we'd like to know more about their relationship, including the key question -- did he love her at all.The film features a number of well done supporting roles, but hats off to John Turturro, who plays Damon's assistant and resident thug with real style and conviction.But this movie is about more than just acting. This is a film that tells a fictionalize real life story and raises a number of disturbing questions. The questions are almost too numerous to list in any reasonable amount of space. But they include, who authorizes the CIA to plan the Bay of Pigs fiasco and similar clandestine incursions into the domestic politics of other nations? The President? By what constitutional authority? The film shows CIA wrecking the coffee crop in some other unnamed Latin American country so it can topple another government it doesn't like. Again, where does the US Constitution give anyone this right? In real life, we know the CIA helped Augusto Pinochet overthrow the democratically elected government of Chile in 1973. When did the American people authorize this? Did Richard Nixon tell us he was going to do this when he ran for re-election in 1972? The frightening thing this film does shed some light on is that a small group of men, members of the Skull and Bones fraternity at Yale, conspire in secret, making these kind of decisions, because they think they know what's best for us. But, as the coffee republic segment points out, it is also what's best for these men, who often find a way to cash in personally on the skullduggery they have authorized.We see this today, of course, through the workings of a little company called Haliburton.In fact, the people we see mucking things up today, the Bushes, Cheneys, etc. are all members of the same Skull and Bones secret societies that produced John Foster Dulles, his brother Allen, and the rest of the self proclaimed patriots who founded the CIA.The real irony, of course, is that they are proved to be wrong so often. The Bay of Pigs failed, and Castro remains in power to this day, but guess what, nothing bad has happened to America because of him. Vietnam 'fell' and America is now busy engaging it as a trading partner. Again, nothing bad happened to America because Vietnam went communist.Not only are the CIA types wrong -- blinded by their own political ideology -- but despite spending billions of dollars on their spook projects, they often miss the big things. They failed to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union, failed to predict Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and, if Bush is to be believed, said Saddam was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction when he wasn't.Don't know about most movie fans, but 'Good Shepherd' does not make me sleep better at night knowing we are in such good hands.",Null,7,14,23 December 2006
Honey," Sweeter than expected
","Jessica Alba must have something, because she keeps drawing me in. This time, I wasn't quite as disappointed as I have been in the past.'Honey' is a reworking of 'Flashdance' and other dance oriented films, but this time it has a social message. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it is a good message.Honey is a talented hip hop dancer who teaches her craft or rather, teaches her hobby to other kids.But as Honey herself quickly finds out, the market for her skills is a limited one and some of the people she has to please to cash in on it are pretty rotten people.Nonetheless, she would sacrifice anything to give other kids in the 'hood' a chance to dance. But exactly why that is, or what it is supposed to accomplish, is never spelled out. It seems no more realistic than teaching every African-American boy to play basketball. Unfortunately, there are more of them in one high school than there are openings in the whole NBA and most of them don't have a chance of making a living at it. So, if they sacrifice everything to follow their dream, what happens when the dream doesn't pan out? Because it doesn't for most basketball players, just like it doesn't for most aspiring hiphop dancers.Don't stay in dance class just to stay off the street, go to school and learn something useful! You're chances of making a living as a hiphop dancer are almost nill.That's about all there is to say about the film.Jessica seems to dance very well, but I am no expert on hiphop. But she seemed fine to me.Her acting here seemed a little better than in her last couple of features, but she was better cast.She remains beautiful and engaging and you want to like her. We'll see what she does next.",Null,0,1,7 April 2004
Sin City," Just plain wrong
","This is not really a review, as I walked out of this dreadful film before the first of the stories had ended.I can't remember ever seeing the kind of appalling violence that this film contained.While it will be excused by many as 'comic book' violence, it is still violence -- and the kind of indoctrination in violence which has turned our country into one of the most violence prone nations on earth.Is it any wonder that America could invade Iraq, kill tens of thousands of people, then find out that the weapons of mass destruction we used as an excuse for the invasion never existed in the first place. Yet that seems to bother many Americans not in the least.No, this movie didn't cause that, but I am convinced that films like this one contribute to the atmosphere of violence which now hovers over America on a permanent basis.This film is part of a sickness that grips our world --the sickness which makes violence our foremost form of entertainment.",Null,2,5,7 April 2005
The Island," Cloned again
","This film takes cloning to a new level. Rather than just being a duplicate of one other clone movie, it borrows its cinematic body parts from a variety of unwilling donors, from 'Coma,' from 'Logan's Run,' from Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis,' from 'Blade Runner,' and apparently from some low budget clone flick that I never even heard of.But does it make good use of these purloined pieces of plot? The answer is both yes and no. Overall, the story works and Michael Bay turns out a mildly entertaining movie that might satisfy younger viewers who crave a new cinema rush every week, and people like me who will pretty much see anything of a sci-fi nature, but also, pretty much anything Scarlott Johansson appears in.The big trouble is, this film is such a wasted opportunity and one big reason is that it was made, not as a thinking person's film, but just one more big summer blockbuster that requires that lots of stuff gets blown up. Particularly distressing is the big chase through downtown Los Angeles midway through the film. Forget the incredible lapses of logic in which people eager to keep this cloning scandal a secret do things that would be bound to start major investigations, like blowing up buildings, killing cops, etc. The big question is, why such excess, why all the overkill? One of this film's real strengths is the impressive set design of this slightly futuristic Los Angeles, borrowed heavily as it is from the 1920s vision immortalized in 'Metropolis.' Rather than have the evildoers chase our hero and heroine though this interesting landscape in some suspenseful manner, they instead just resort to car crashes, helicopter crashes, and lots of other tired antics found in every other action movie.But I guess this is what 14 year old boys crave, and so this is what they get from Hollywood.My last complaint is simple. Stars Ewan McGregor and Scarlott Johanssen seem to have zero chemistry together and their mandatory mating towards the end of the film seems tacked on, as if somebody suddenly remembered they needed a love scene and they'd better throw one in. The interesting thing is, these two cloned humans are supposed to be educated to the age of 15 year olds, an age when most kids are chomping at the bits for their first romantic experiences. So something could have been made of their sexual awakening. Instead, we get the one obligatory love scene that has about as much passion as a dental exam.Overall, I liked this movie, but don't like the fact that in targeting Hollywood's standard teenage audience, the filmmakers have missed every opportunity to make a good film.",Null,2,4,26 July 2005
