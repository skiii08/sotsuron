Black Swan," A confusing mess.
","Spoilers! This movie should have been called 'Crotch Grab!' not 'Black Swan' because that is all I saw in this movie the boss would grab Nat's crotch, then grab his own. Then grab her's again. Then he told her to grab her own crotch! WTF!? AND THEN, that other girl, Jackie from that 70's show grabbed that guy's crotch that knocked up Portman! I am really confused as to how molesting each other tells a story. As people have said before me; dancers DO NOT act this way. They are hired dancers and that is all! Do construction workers have to 'FEEL' the house? No they do what they are told and get the job done! I guess people acted well, if the movie was about a nut house! Really these people exist!? It's just too much to take!",1,26,44,24 March 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Absolutely atrocious
","Warning spoilers!The movie starts out with the main character making some outrageous claims about high school. You know the typical American whining 'school is prison' 'I am stuck here' 'It's the most horrible thing ever' Really? There are people that are starving, there are wars in other countries, there are rampant diseases, severe poverty, high crime rates. Yet High School is the worst thing ever? Ugh, this is why from the get go I knew that this was a 8u11$#!t movie.To have a good movie you have to have a BELIEVABLE introduction to base the movie on. When your premise is FALSE then the entire movie is (r@p. It all just fell apart from there.So this guy goes to school. So far all I got from the movie is total lies. I am WAITING for some REAL, FACTUAL thing to go on. Something to connect to. Really ANYTHING!!!! I got nothing. Just more lies. A guy gets back from being sick and people MAKE FUN OF HIM!? WTF!? Omg, MORE LIES! People would FEEL SORRY FOR HIM! Wow, the girl that calls him names in his English class is totally unrealistic!So now we are into the movie and absolutely NOTHING has happened. I have no clue who this kid is, who his family is, who his new friends are, or even what time period this is even supposed to be taking place in. I mean how unclear can one movie be!? Can't they have put some text stating the year at the start of the movie? More confusion and lies! Also if this is supposed to take place in the 80's or even 90's then they are dressed ALL WRONG! Their hair is ALL WRONG! Ugh, people DID NOT DRESS LIKE THAT! If you just want to dress people in the style of today then set the d@mn movie in the present! Except for the odd over sized sweaters here and there I did not see much authentic old fashion. Looks like you can buy all the stuff they are wearing at forever 21!At this point the movie felt like it was 3, possibly 4 hours long. That's what happens when ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is happening! I was not even a half hour into this not even 2 hour movie! So basically at this point we are told that these people who became the main guy's friend are 'outcasts' WTF!? Umm, yeah tell their screaming fans that they are unattractive. If Logan Lerman walked down the street he would probably be chased by fans, the same with Emma Watson, and so on. Emma did a pretty bad job as usual. Her pointless head bobbing, wooden acting, and terrible accent were all present. Again the movie has not given me ANYTHING to grab onto as real. I have been lied to, and it's just continuing.So to wrap things up we learn that BOTH Emma, and Logan's characters were molested/raped/abused/etc. as children. OK? So that is grounds for falling in love? So your abuse defines you? Wow what a horrible message this movie sends. Talking about messages; this movie is jam paced with every cliché possible. I was wondering if they managed to fit them all in there! Here goes: life sucks, hs is the worst thing ever, we are infinite, we will become parents one day, no one can take hs experiences away from us, friends are forever, don't let men beat you, be yourself, don't dumb yourself down for a man, we are helpless to 'save' any one, enjoy the moment, etc.I even forgot how the movie ended it was so pointless and meaningless. As for the entire movie I was lied to. I could not make heads nor tails of this movie. I just felt like I had to write this review to urge people not to watch the movie and bring the misleading rating down. This movie does not have enough 1 star reviews! It's bad in every way shape and form. There is no: realistic story, character development, time frame, truth. Ugh I'm getting a head ache. Avoid this movie. It seems like the only reason people saw this movie was because they were fans of the actors. Sad. This is the reason movie quality has steadily been going down. People don't care what the movie even is as long as they get to stare at some actor. That's why (r@p like this is even allowed to be made. No wounder to took so long to make this movie, no studio would green light it! But in today's celebut@rd obsessed world it was....",1,27,70,22 January 2013
Star Trek," Very sad that they turned Star Trek into Star Wars.
","Spoilers!Oh god no. JJ! Why JJ why!?I don't even know where to begin. As many have already stated this is NOT Star Trek. It's franchise rape. They call these characters Kirk and Spock etc. But they are not. These writers take the lazy way out and explain this rape as an 'alternate reality.' How sad that 'scific' is being used to explain why Kirk is an a-hole and why Spock is emotional.Why even call it Star Trek? Just call it 'Future Space Adventure'.Dear god. Star Trek TOS was about virtue, being good, doing the right thing, being level headed, etc. This so called 'star trek' is about throwing tantrums to get what you want, using people, having mood swings, etc. TOTAL OPPOSITE.The sad fact of the matter is that Star Trek fans LOVE this fandom. And because of this love they will see just about anything ST related. That was the problem. JJ and co took advantage of this. They thought 'Well, the trekkies will see what ever crap we shove under their faces. Haha. Let's focus on getting in the non-ST fans to make lots of $$$.'So what SciFic franchise do most ppl like? Star WARS. So they made it like that. Any REAL, and yes there are real TOS fans, ST fan will not consider this real Trek.It's not exactly a bad movie, when compared to movies these days. But that's not saying much.... The problem is that it pretends to be something it's not.In TOS there was like 5 sec of action then 30 min of discussion. Nu!trek is more like 1hr 45min of action and 10 min of dialogue. What happened to the intelligent discussions? Gone, replaced by yelling and more action. This is no Star Trek!Sure this is an 'alternate reality' but in the Mirror Mirror ep of TOS Spock was the SAME even in another universe! STILL LOGICAL! So how is he so emo in this one? Make no sense....Also the writers, and majority of the actors were not ST fans. Only Karl Urban was, and he CLEARLY gave the best performance with what little scenes he had. Since he knew what ST was ABOUT. The writers just sat down watched the 1st aired ep of ST TOS and were like 'Boom, we'll do that!' In that ep, Uhura sort of flirted with Spock. But his real love interest on the ship was Nurse Chapel. And it was implied in the later movies that Uhura ended up with Scotty...but these writers are no fans to care. Just lazy.",1,4,5,13 October 2013
Zootopia," Gets one star for that HORRIFIC song!!!!!
","While watching this movie I really liked the quality of the animation. But then that pos song came on. I blocked it out best I could, then the movie went on. I could never forgive the greedy marketers for this song, so by default I took off 5 stars. I was content with giving it 5 stars. 10 for nice story and animation 1 star for the bad song. A compromise if you will. BUT THEN THEY PLAYED THIS POS SONG AGAIN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE!!! One star it is!I cannot forgive it. We get it you wanna create as many revenue streams as possible. Selling the movie, soundtrack, toys, happy meals, clothing, posters, etc..... BUT you have to stop yourself before you sell out and no one takes you seriously anymore.Really that song is terrible. Even by pop music standards. I know this movie is supposed to be for kids, but damn TOO REPETITIVE! I feel sorry for anyone that was dragged to this movie.Why did I watch it you ask? Well I was in the mood for a movie and saw an ad for this. And thought, well maybe it's not just another dumb kids movie, boy was I wrong.Another problem this movie has is that it's too current. Too many references to modern day things. I miss classic Disney movies, you know the hand drawn 2D ones. I really hate how greedy Disney has become. They spit out a bs animated movie that you will forget 5 seconds later cuz the next bs animated movie is coming out!!!! Whereas Cinderella, Aladdin, The Lion King, etc.... are enduring. They even talked about pirated movies in this....as if to explain why they have to crank out so many movies. Most people will buy into this, they are blinded by the Disney brand. Not everything Disney makes is gold. I, as much as my happiness is chagrined, have standards. And I just can't enjoy such an empty movie. It basically boils down to small town girl fights big town corruption. And we tackle sexism, racism, cellphone humor, slapstick, and other random current things. This is messy. Also for a movie that is against stereotypes they have many in there! But this is not just Disney, most Hollywood movies are like this. They go on at LENGTH about equality but the leads are always young models......",1,19,47,18 February 2017
Suicide Squad," Great movie for showing how bad a hyped movie can be.
","I hope this is a lesson to people, anytime a movie is over hyped it's gonna be bad.Let me explain. Movies have a budget, a focus if you will. Depending on how they want the move to turn out. Just like if you are cooking a meal. If you use cheap ingredients in a dish, it will taste like bland sh!t. If you use only the best, you will most likely have a mouth watering meal.Let's see where they spent the money. They got a cheap director. Who wrote and directed! Did they get some kind of discount there? Lol. Next they hired basically nobodies. Except Will Smith and Jared Leto I guess. Viola Davis is an of the moment actor. People like her from TV so throw her in there. And the piece of objectified meat Margot Robbie.Now in order to get people to buy faulty products they have to be tricked some how. Why not just make a good product that sells itself? Well not all people are talented enough to make a good product to begin with. So they will advertise some food product as being the 'best' 'delicious' 'mouthwatering' when in reality it is none of these things. Why not spend the money to hire better chefs? Or in this movie's case hire better people to make it? What they did was focus the money on the advertising. It's how I knew right away the movie was gonna be cr@p. The trailer looked great, but it made no sense. And as I watched the movie it was painfully obvious they filmed it to make a deceptive trailer. Certain scenes that were in the trailer made NO SENSE in the movie. Just none.Reminded me of the new Star Trek movie. Advertisements: 'Best movie ever.' My thoughts: 'Oh so it's cr@p.'If something is good people, PEOPLE will talk about, word of mouth. Don't believe the media mouth piece. Don't believe the slick advertisements. The trailer is good does not equate to it's good movie. Really these people need to be sued for false advertising at this point. The trailer was 90% Joker and Harely. When they are BARELY in the movie. I think it's so bad that ALL of their scenes in the movie are used in the trailer just about. LOLOh to the movie it's self now. The plot makes no sense. No sane character motivations. And the 'well they are just crazy' excuse does not apply. WHY did Harely fall for Joker? Why is the Aussie guy the way he is? Why does the fire guy not want to kill, who is that random Asian chick? I mean she literally WALKED onto the movie. 'Hey here is a random Asian women, her sword traps souls kbye.' What? Even with 3 members of the squad just being shoved in there. They still did not explain back story of the other members. Dead shot has a daughter, and? What else, crocodile guy....wait no backstory. Umm, drawing a real blank here guys.Yeah so I hope that people learn that when a movie is hyped to he11 as 'the best movie ever' you can just see right through it and see it's bulls!t. Great movie to teach people this important lesson. I try to see the good in everything. So there it is. A cautionary tale.",1,4,6,21 November 2016
Pacific Rim," Seriously Hollywood?
","WARNING spoilers!Wtf? Really? But seriously though, how was this movie made? I mean was it based on some well liked series of books, comic books, TV series, anything? From the looks of it no.They just made it up, and boy does it show. The plot makes 0 sense. The acting is TERRIBLE and the ending is confusing.Really the whole story make no sense. Why these monsters are here, why they are called certain things, why the suits are different, etc. The only stable thing was this supposed relationship between The main male character and the main female character.But that went no where. As with all other things in this movie it fizzled out. When she first saw him, she was all blushing and such. And he would give a grin or two. But the last scene they did not even kiss as you would expect. Yes, it would have been cliché. And they did show some control for not going for that 'We're alive let's kiss' thing. But in a movie that follows every OTHER cliché (there is only 1 man 4 the job, opposites attract, we gotta work 2gether, etc.) why not do the one that ppl actually ENJOY!?I suppose that would mess with the girls story and sort of reduce her to a physical object. But it does that ANYWAYS with the whole 'don't let her fight cuz she's a girl' thing! I was really let down there was not even a kiss. I mean don't build up a romance and then lead it to friendship. Really they hugged at the end? Why was she all checking his ripped body out earlier in the movie? What were those googly eyes she had for him when she first met him? Why did he keep sticking up for here even though he KNEW she was not ready? They liked each other. The no kiss ending was sad. Either she is the sad puppy dog. Or he just does not see her in that way. Or perhaps they left this to be explored in the *shudders* sequel.Which leads me to my main point how in the hell was this big-budget Hollywood movie even made? How? WHO approved it? WHO? Some guy had a random idea and they just said yes? WHAT? So many great movie ideas out there and they chose THIS!? Sad that a movie devoid of all good qualities gets made. Bad acting? Check. Non-sense making plot? Check. Nothing gets paid off? Check. I mean really I would go into detail about how many things make no sense in this move but many b4 me have already done that. Basically this movie is a half-@$$ed effort of mashing several movies into 1. Action/CGI/Comedy/Romance/Mystery/SciFic/Drama. But just like in cooking when you throw too many ingredients into a dish it is no longer delicious but confusing as all the elements struggle for your attention. It tries to be everything and ends up as nothing due to general laziness on Hollywood's part for not demanding better quality movies. I only watched this in desperation to see a new movie. I guess when it's the only game in town ppl see it. How sad.",1,9,17,13 October 2013
Man of Steel," Again?
","WARNING SPOILERSWHY did they make ANOTHER Superman movie? I mean haven't we had enough Superman? Christopher Reeve (Superman 1-4) Dean Cain (Lois & Clark) Tom Welling (Smallville) Brandon Routh (Superman Returns)And there are also all the cartoon series AND comic books.So WHY? There are SO many ORIGINAL plots, stories, and screenplays out there! WHY do Superman AGAIN? What's that? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ riiiight!Seems like after Christopher Nolan's dark Batman did so well, all other superhero franchises took notice. And all superheros had to be darker. Look at the re-reboot of Spider-Man with Andrew Garfield. It was HORRIBLE. But did they stop there? No. They made Iron Man Dark. And of course it was Superman's turn. But wait. Superman is a goodie 2 shoes. Being dark is just not him. This is the core reason this movie made no sense.The reason the darkness thing worked for Batman was because he did have a dark past, present, and future. Gotham is overrun with crime and violence. But Superman was sent to Earth out of love, and loving people found and raised him. While Batman is seen primarily as a vigilante. Most call out 'Superman!' when they need help. So it makes no sense for this good guy to LIE about his identity, LIE to Lois Lane, NOT save his father's life, and allow so much damage to a city.This movie also has strange amount of propaganda in it. You're telling me Krypton found a way for women NOT to have to go through painful pregnancy/childbirth? Umm, how is that a bad thing? Oh right, they 'programmed' the babies to be what society wanted them to be. Well with all the tech they had could they not reprogram people? Also if Jor-El was a part of this system, and as he says he was a failure then isn't EVERYTHING he does a failure? So many plot holes in this movie to be certain. Like how does he just become a reporter when the whole city was basically just destroyed?Also why were the costumes in Krypton seem to be from Shakespearean days? Also the whole baby water scene, why did they steal that from the Matrix? And steal the black hole idea from Star Trek 09? $$$$$$$$$ Instead of taking a chance on something new they just re-do what worked. The reason ppl like what worked was because it was ORIGINAL, it fit, and was good. Just slapping together different movies ppl liked is called plagiarism and UNoriginal! Take a chance and make a NEW movie Hollywood! Not this totally unoriginal rip-off. Oh by the way it also ripped off Captain America where he was found in the ice. I could go on but you get the point.",1,3,10,20 November 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Now that's a movie!
","I for one am a fan of MI movies so I may be biased. But this was a non stop action thrill ride, filled with great action sequences, plausible story lines and comedy to boot!This movie gets right to it the first scene we are right in the action. What I love about this movie is that, even though it's complicated, it makes sense. The way it unfolds is excellent, and you can follow it.This action movie does not make the mistakes of others. It has no pointless scenes, it does not have impossible tech, does not take itself too seriously and is not sexist as fu(&.I really really really enjoyed that the woman who helped Ethan out was not treated like a physical object and simply 'the love interest'. You know simply a toy for our hero to play with....no. She was an actual human being! Amazing! Sure she is attractive but so is the rest of the cast. I really liked how she was treated equally, very refreshing considering how sexist most movies tend to be.The movie keeps you guessing, NOT confused. There is a BIG difference there. So if you wanna see top of the line special effects and have a whole lot of fun this is the film for you! I highly recommend it! They keep the film current with some nods to the past films. It's just perfect. I like how the movie does not lose itself in the bs trends most movies do. This one will be a classic that you could enjoy for many years to come.",10,0,2,2 January 2016
Captain America: Civil War," These movies have become white noise
","I'm confused so much, all these movies sorta blend into each other. Since they are tied together. Hulk, Thor, Cap America, Iron man, etc.... Since the avengers were in this I assumed it was another Avengers movie.But no it's Captain America: Civil War? Huh? Don't you need the Avengers for a civil war? What it being CIVIL and all. Umm....so confused.Where is Thor and Hulk, and Loki and and and.....I can go on and on, but you get the point. We really know it was budget issues. They are IN the Avengers, SO why are they not asked to sign? ?????Confusion. WHY do, ALL OF A SUDDEN, half the avengers seem not to trust Cap???? OH right since that is what the plot needed. This whole movie is just trash. Random spider man and ant man thrown in too, why not? Just whatever at this point. Explosions and random sh*t. Can anyone make sense of these movies anymore?All started with Cap, the Nazis stole something from Thor/Loki....then he was frozen, woken up....umm Tony Stark's father knew Cap. Umm Cap almost banged Peggy? She did stuff created shield or something....then Hydra got in. Then Loki went crazy, and Thor stopped him, or didn't. Umm then Iron man made suits....Black widow wore tight tight clothes. She was in ballet??? Kissed Cap, but loves Hulk??? Umm....wtf is even happening any more. Robin hood has a secret family??? And who was that guy in a panther suit. RANDOM AS F***! LOL ?????If you LOVE confusing white noise this is the movie for you!!!!! 'Confusing White Noise: The Movie!'",1,142,282,2 September 2016
No Strings Attached," Girl with the glasses was the only good part!
","This movie is complete $#!t!!!!! The ONLY good part was the crazy girl with the glasses. She was in the movie for such a little time! If only the movie was about her!!!!! She was the ONLY real person in the movie! These other people; horny girl that hates love, man with NO balls, people making decisions based on NOT SENSE!!!! no no no but to further the plot!!! For example when the guy started dancing with that girl in the frat party (that he ended up with at the end of the movie) did not want to dance with him. WHY WHY WHY did she stop dancing!? YET later she suddenly falls head over heels for him!? WTF WTF WTF!????? REALLY? YET, the slut that hates love NEVER changes? Hmmmmm....... Yes the movie MAKES NO SENSE!!!! The ONLY REASON to watch this movie is for the BRIEF moments the girl in the glasses is on!",1,9,15,15 May 2011
Bridesmaids," Horrible movie; so forgettable I already forgot it!
","Horrible movie; so forgettable I already forgot it! This is one of those movies that is so bad that I pretend that I never watched it at all! What I mean is that it was not memorable; just a bunch of random events. Funny is 'The Simpsons' a show where you remember what the ENTIRE episode was about and quote it from memory. This movie went though me like water. I watched it then forgot about it, it was not worth remembering nor could you, since it there was nothing to remember. The movie was a bore! I was bored to tears! The entire time I was checking to see how much was left! I was relieved it was over! So that is my explanation for my title, I will tell you what I can about this movie. I feel like I have to tell people to avoid this piece of crap! SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT: OK so the first scene in the movie is a 'sex' scene. Hmm, so watching this I knew that you can't really watch this with just anyone. Anyways it was pretty pointless and disgusting. I guess what they were trying to say is that this guy is a jerk. But the scene where he tells her to leave was adequate to show he was a jerk! Then the scene with her jumping his fence was just even more pointless. Umm, yeah I get hazy as to what else happened after this.Ummoh yeah! She had a failed business and worked at some place. She's poor. OK her roommates are not normal. Yeah then her friend talks about vulgar things, of course, IN A PUBLIC PLACE! How unrealistic is that!? WOW! Then I guess her friend gets engaged and crazy $#!t occurs! NONE of it makes sense! That speech battle, that I only remembered by reading another person's review, was cringe worthy! THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN! The band would start playing. OK, sorry! This movie just CONSTANTLY insults my intelligence!!!! Well, then I forgot what happened, and I don't care to try and remember. I watched this because I was desperate for a new comedy movie. Don't watch this it's horrible!",Null,7,11,20 September 2011
Friends with Benefits," Just like No Strings Attached but slightly different and still horrible.
","Spoilers ahead!So when I first heard of this movie I got REALLY confused. Because a movie JUST LIKE THIS was JUST released it was called No Strings Attached. Wow it's official: Hollywood HAS RUN OUT OF IDEAS! They are so shameless about it now even. They don't even try to space them apart anymore to try and trick people! Like the Hulk reboots. At least they had YEARS separation. And people found THAT outrageous! These movies came out back to back! Here let me list the similarities between these two movies:Both have the same plot: a male and female agree to be 'fu(& buddies' Both end up the same way: the male and female end up wanting more Both have an actress that was in Black Swan; NSA: Natalie Portman FwB: Mila Kunis Both have the male lead that was more famous in the 90's; NSA: Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show actor) FwB: Justin Timberlake (N*sync singer) Both have outrageous, BETTER, more interesting supporting actors/characters; NSA: the girl with the glasses FwB: Justin's gay friend. Both have these people be at the top of their game and rich! NSA: the girl is a doctor and the guy I forgot but he was pretty well off FwB: The girl has a cushy job, and the guy is getting money thrown at him!This last similarity brings me to my next point; the movie was unrealistic. This movie is taking place in a post-recession world. There are flash mobs, new technology, references to current things. YET in this movie companies are BEGGING people to work for them!? WTF!? THERE ARE NO JOBS! This was the MOST INSULTING DISGUSTING THING about this piece of (r@p movie! They will hire some #0re to FLY to LA to CONVINCE a guy WITH HIS OWN company to work for them. Doesn't that mean that they have to pay him more? It's for GQ magazine sure, but a mag has THAT much money!? And for what!? This guy does not even do his job! Knows nothing as proved by his gay friends question's like 'What font did you use?' This guys 'brilliant' response; 'I don't know. Times new roman?' Most of the time he is fooling around with the girl and doing other random $#!t!!!! It disgusts me that Hollywood does not get it! Life is not a fairy tale! People don't and CAN'T live these lives. That apartment Justin's character can supposedly afford (IN NEW YORK NO LESS!) even the rich struggle to get! WOW!The only difference between these movies is the person that wants their relationship to mean more. In NSA it's the guy that wants more and the girl that doesn't 'get it.' In FwB it's the girl that wants more and the guy does not 'get it.'Also I hated how this movie tried to be so hipster. Like it was trying to be so 'cool.' As if they were 'better than' these movies they were making fun of. At this point pretty much ANY other romantic comedy is better than this piece of crap! Even NSA had the girl with the glasses - so funny! While this movie's stand out character; the gay friend, was barely even in the movie! Also the ending was a cop out they did not admit that they were wrong! Cynical to the end! Wow what idiots, what a pointless movie!",1,26,45,24 December 2011
Burlesque," Bad movie, good musical numbers.
","Now I am giving this 1 star even though I enjoyed the movie, well parts of it, let me explain...Spoilers ahead warning! I am rating the MOVIE, NOT the dancing, NOT the music, NOT the costumes. The movie itself is pretty horrible. Flimsy storyline, and horrible acting mostly from Christina herself. On a movie level it sucks! But the dance numbers were good. The outfits were good. The music was catchy and good.I don't know why they turned Xtina's live shows into a movie and added a 'plot' around the numbers. I would have been happy to just see two hours of JUST Xtina PERFORMING! Because THAT is what she is good at. She belongs on a stage. Not on a movie set! She is a great singer and dancer. Acting...no, sorry. She is easy on the eyes, but she needs to back it up with acting skill.This movie was just an attempt to cash in on Xtina's and Cher's names, among other actors in the film. They threw the story together as an excuse to have these elaborate dance numbers. If you saw the movie in one number the 'plot' just gets in the way! SHOW ME THE DANCING! Parts of the movie made no sense like if she was from a small town then why was she the only one without an accent? She sounded like any Hollywood girl! Also Tess would have not been that nice. People in big cities are cruel as HELL! Why did that Veronica Mars girl not sue Tess? I'm sure she was hired to be the main attraction, then just dumped for Xtina? I guess Tess was poor or something. But people took actions that made no sense. If you watch the movie you will most likely only enjoy the song and dance numbers.",1,4,8,23 June 2011
Wonder Woman," Fake Feminism
","First off this movie sucked. Whew, OK now lets go in chronological order to all the suckage.Young WW: We see WW as a child, all she wants to do is fight bla bla bla. What I saw more than a horrible child actor was the fact that just about ALL the women appeared to have no less than 10 plastic surgery procedures done on them. Now, these are supposedly 'ancient times'. Even in the modern world at the time they did not have the capabilities of face lifts/nose jobs/cheek&chin implants, lips injections, and boob jobs. Among other things.What powerful women they are that they are so insecure that they have to cut themselves open. Also why does no one age? But well they are apparently made of magic...or something. Reminds me of the sexism of a michael bay movie, no old women, no fat women, no ugly women, no little kids exist. Only hot model type women exist. Tall, big boobs, high cheekbones, etc.So, according to this movie, women are valid, strong, equal....as long as they are young beautiful models. Umm...Fake feminism. Women should be equal since women are human beings. Being sexually desirable should NOT define women. WW is hot therefore according to this movie's logic she is powerful, wonderful, great, etc...*sigh*Next, when she finally comes of age, the first thing that happens is that she meets a guy. OK now I gotta compare this movie to Twilight. And you know you are in some deep do-do if your movie is put in the same breath as Twilight. Well here goes sadly, both were directed by women, starring women, and supposedly empower women. LOL But WW's WHOLE life, just like Bella in Twilight, revolves around men. Aries, and her love interest. Just like Bella was all about Edward, not her own well being, not her family, not her education, not her future, but A MAN. When are we going to have a movie where a woman is not chasing after a man?So then we have Chris Pine doing some subtle sexism as he does in all his films, undermining women. Even though this woman FREAKING jumped into the air and broke a whole bell tower. He SEES that she has magical powers YET he STILL can't suspended his disbelief in the fact that yet ANOTHER magical creature can exist!? Aries? Really? And THIS light misogynist is the man she falls for. And bases her WHOLE life on. 'Love is the answer.' Yeah he truly loved her, by undermining her the WHOLE time...and oh yeah she literally was a GOD. LMAO",1,3,13,8 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Makes no sense
","From what I gather fans wanted this movie. They just wanted to see Batman and Superman fight. It makes no sense since they are on the same side.So they make up bs to make them fight. Batman sees Superman destroy a city so he's like 'oh no he didn't!' and grows to hate him. But wait....he is ALSO a superhero does he not understand that he was fighting BLEEPING aliens from another planet trying to attack Earth? And in the process yes people got hurt?So what Batman has never hurt anyone? What? Isn't Batman the vicious one? I mean we see him gleefully killing many people in THIS very movie! Is Batman this stupid?OK well....Batman is basically a reclusive billionaire who was severely damaged from his parents murder, hides in an underground cave and pretends to be a bat as he fights crime. Translation Bruce Wayne is insane. It's pretty clear from this movie...that is really the only way this film makes sense.Umm other questions....-why is Lois so much older than Clark? I mean yes men are like 10 years older than women most times in movies and no one bats and eye. I guess since she is a good actress. But why can't you just get people who are the same age? I don't get it. -why is Wonder Woman in this and the Flash/Aqua-man/etc.? I get that they need to set up sequels, but really? Can't they do it like the avengers and put a scene after the credits?-why did they try to put like 8 movies in one? Batman crazy/Superman depressed/justice league/Lex villain/2 monsters/thugs/foreign country problems/Clark&Lois relationship problems/Bat&Superman parental issuesI mean if you wanna see Bat and Super fight this is the movie for you. The first half is really boring though. Not much happens except for the audience being confused.",1,7,14,19 July 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Yates is an idiot, and you are too if you liked this movie since it means that you CAN'T READ!
","Yates R@PED the books; he took what HE wanted from the books & then did whatever HE wanted 2 do with it! DISGUSTING! He IGNORED what JK wanted, & the fans that took the time 2 ACTUALLY READ the books! All action no substance! This movie was made ONLY 4 $!SPOILERS:Being 1 of the ppl that ACTUALLY READ ALL 7 BOOKS I c that they cut with only A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS 2 GO! U'd think that THEY WILL COVER THESE HANDFUL OF CHAPTERS IN EXTREME DETAIL! NO! Yates NOT ONLY ignored the MOST IMPORTANT parts of the book; THE PLOT, but he +ED HIS OWN stuff THAT WAS NOT IN THE BOOK AT ALL! I.E.: the WHOLE ENDING! The problem is that they DID NOT BUILD IT UP, as m0r0n Yates did whatever he wanted, JKR spent SO MUCH TIME creating this universe/story. It all makes sense in the books. Can u say the same is true 4 Yates's movies? No!The whole point of the defeat of Voldermort was 2 point out his ignorance! 2 bad Yates was even WORSE than Voldermort! I doubt that Yates can read. I don't even want to capitalize his name anymore since it shows some respect towards him. I do not consider him 2 b a human being. Even worse than Voldermort. At least Voldy has excuses 4 being evil; in-breeding, abandonment, isolation, being different, genetic evilness, Slythern DNA, no guidance, & so on! Did yates even GO 2 school?As many b4 me have pointed out 'The good, the bad, & the ugly' I will 2! GOOD: NONE! BAD: ENTIRE MOVIE UGLY: yates!Sure it was fun 2 c some of the things happening. BUT the action sequences r MEAININGLESS! It's the DIALOUGE that's important! 4 instance the Ron/Hermione kiss! 1st off u could not even c them kiss! Ron's head hid the kiss! It seems as if that idi0t that plays Hermione DID NOT want to kiss him!Anyways the REASON NOT the ACTION was more important with this kiss. IN THE BOOK they kissed cuz RON CHANGED! The KISS was 4 THIS REASON! Not the 'reason' in the movie! As ppl have pointed out b4 me; 'We're alive let's kiss!'MORE PROBLEMS I have with this movie: Did not explain: many deaths, cover Dumbledore's past. (the sister, his friends, his mother, his childhood, his obsession with the DH, etc.), explain many of the relationships Ron/Herm, Harry/Ginny, Luna/Neville (stated by JK later).The epilogue was HORRIBLY done & confusing; u don't know whose kid is whose, & they do not look that old!They skipped the ending where Harry OUTSMARTS Voldermort IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CROWD! Instead Harry disarms him! Totally different meaning!Snape's memories/flashbacks WERE RUSHED! If I had not read the books I would have been confused as 2 what was going on! Can u imagine telling actors: Yeah let's do this '$#!t' get it out of the way & get back 2 exploding stuff!The movie displayed Harry as being an idi0t, a reflection of yates! The ghost of Ravenclaw did NOT tell him where the crown was! HE figured that out HIMSELF! She only told him the story! Oops, story MUST b ignored by yates! Also the ghost DID NOT attack him in the books! Really yates u have 2 INSERT action where there was none!?They put Slytherns in the dungeons? They were evacuated in the book! WHAT? It goes AGAINST the whole POINT OF THESE BOOKS THAT <3 IS STRONGER! So it was inconsistent when Harry saved Draco's life! D@mn yates! So the head of Gryffindor is as heartless as Voldermort? Umm the dungeons r UNDERGROUND! If u can't understand: Hogwarts is crumbling, u know FALLING DOWN! SoÂ… If they r beneath this rubble how the fu(& r they going 2 get out? Really, yates does not understand gravity? Oh yes he CAN'T EVEN READ how can he understand advanced things like SCIENCE!Yes I UNDERSTAND that u cannot put every detail in2 the books. BUT u CAN TRY 2 DO SO! SO MANY PARTS yates just IGNORED the story & put other stuff! Like Harry pushing Voldermort off that cliff. Couldn't we have used that time 2 DO STUFF THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BOOKS!?Y does this movie have ANY good reviews!? Oh yes ppl can't read.",Null,3,5,22 July 2011
Me Before You," Emilia Clarke's eyebrows make this movie unwatchable
","I tired to watch this movie I really did. But I quickly realized that Emilia Clarke CAN'T ACT. And made the movie unwatchable.What I do with movies is skip through them a bit just to get a feel of what the movie is like. Too many movies I sit through about 10 mins and I feel like 'I wasted 10 min of my life I will never get back!' NEVER AGAIN! So I skip and within a few minutes can tell if I should even BOTHER watching the whole movie. I did this with this one and saw there was nothing worth watching. Just a pile of dung really.So basically, as most people can tell by the current state of cinema, that it's not really the movie that is important, it's what is behind the scenes. Like take the recent Suicide Squad. Hyped as all get out. And it turned out to be a dud. I have not seen it yet, but I am not shocked. The REASON that movie was made was to cash in on the popularity of superhero movies. Avengers, Justice League, Bat/Super/Spider man, etc.Now to the reason this movie was made: THIS movie is a VEHICLE to try and launch the career of these two actors. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Emilia Clarke is famous for the same reason Sasha Grey is, to put it lightly. Emilia Clarke appeared totally naked in the basically soft core p0rn TV show + gore that is 'Game of Thrones'. That is all really. The only reason she is in this movie is to make her look like a 'serious/real actress'. Nope, sorry girl, you are just a piece of meat, you wont fool me. And Sam Claflin, sorry, you can act, but you just can't carry a movie. You will ALWAYS be ONLY a SUPPORTING actor. Sorry. I thought we learned that lesson in the failure that was 'Love, Rosie' (2014). Lily Collins ALSO can't carry a movie. WHY are we making the same mistake in THIS movie????It was painful watching Emilia Clarke try to break her type casting as the 'hot girl' playing a 'nerdy girl'. REALLY? Painful to watch just painful. She can't act, and the movie is just trash. The story as well. I mean it's like insult to injury. Imagine a sick old hobo just lost control over his bowels and bladder, in a dumpster where he was digging for food, and you throw a dead body on top, vomit, throw some dirty diapers in there, and top it all off with medical waste. That is a good way to describe this movie. From bad to worse. 1. Bad actress 2. No leading man 3. Bad plot 4. bad .......well you get the point.Good movies are just good movies, there should be no ulterior motives. Just make a movie. I don't even know what I fu(&!ng expected from this movie it was so bad. A nice little rom com at least. Nope just a pile of tripe. STOP making movies for reasons other than making a good movie!(p.s. her eyebrows were Emma Watson level bad)",1,29,64,23 August 2016
Atonement," Horrible pointless movie.
","Spoilers!The movie takes place just before WWII breaks out. WWII was HORRIBLE; Hitler, The Holocaust, lots of innocent people died. MY GOD! We can ALL agree that it was a really bad thing. So y in the HELL would these idiots write ANOTHER sad story ON TOP of all the HORRIBLENESS going on around them. IF Cecilia & Robbie had a HAPPY (as happy as u can get during this time) ending the movie would have been ACTUALLY good. But when they both die it just makes THE WHOLE THING POINTLESS!The movie starts in a confusing way. We r following a little girl. We have no set up. Who is she? Why should I care? I hate movies that keep facts from us 2 'build mystery.' It's only a mystery if u already told us all the facts and WE have not figured it out.This little girl misinterprets events as sinister. Her sister, Cecelia, was having an argument with this Robbie guy. She jumped in a fountain & Robbie stared at her. Okay? How can this b sinister? The 'lovemaking' scene in the library. How can this girl think this was rape? Cecelia was not fighting him, screaming, NOTHING! These non-sense making scenes r shown 2 ways in order 2 'explain' y this little girl thinks something bad happened. I wish Ricky Ricardo was present 2 say, 'U've got some 'splaning 2 do!'Also, the library scene drove me crazy! This house is shown 2 us at the start of the movie with Briony running though it. From this we know that it has MANY ROOMS. ROOMS with beds in them! ROOMS with LOCKS ON THE DOORS! But what room do they choose!?; THE LIBRARY! A place where ppl converge frequently! & THEY LEFT THE DOOR AJAR! What the %#@$!? These 2 ppl KNOW that there r small children in this house. So u'd think they would think; 'What if they walked in?' No, no. They just seem 2 b complete idiots! When watching this particular scene I thought 'Y did they not choose another room?' When u have wild crazy b00m b00m time & leave the door open someone will c u! Duh!So then this little girl thinks she saw Robbie r@pe the other little girl & Robbie gets shipped off 2 war. Cecelia does LITTLE 2 save him. OK, this is supposed 2 b a romance movie. Hmm, Cecelia does not seem 2 care much when ALL she says in defense of Robbie is 'I would not put much stock in what she says; she has a wild imagination.' Something like that. Not even hysterically. She says it not even HALF-heartedly. But with indifference! INDIFFERENCE! sarcasm-Wow it MUST b love!-sarcasm Cecelia seems 2 half BELIEVE what Briony is saying! How can u <3 someone & even THINK that they r capable of SUCH evil!? Or how little do u know them?I believe what the other reviewers said that this was not a romance movie but just an excuse 2 get certain shots. The backdrop was pretty. The outfits were very beautiful especially Cecelia's green dress! The point is; is that it's an empty movie.It's so pointless cuz it's just senseless. There is no lesson 2 b learned. & most importantly NO atonement. U ruined 2 people's lives & u became a BEST SELLING author. THAT'S atonement!? Writing a FICTIONAL happy ending!? WTF!? It's like saying, 'I shot a bunch of innocent people but I made a painting of them all happy & smiling that should make it alright.' WOW! Just wow! I did not know that u could cram this much ignorance in2 1 movie!Anyway u slice it; it's just pointless. What if Briony had not been 'jealous' (cuz how can Briony even <3 Robbie if she is OK with him suffering?) & did not say Robbie raped that little girl? War would have still broken out. Would Robbie b in medical school? Would that have saved him from fighting? Not sure on British law at the time. But if there was a draft then he would have been screwed either way. What about Cecelia? Would she not have bcome a nurse 2 help out & b evacuated 2 the place where she drowned? What's the point of it all? At the end Briony said that she gave them the time they so desperately wanted. How much time was that? Cecelia & Robbie BOTH admit that THEY wasted a lot of time 2! So what they could of had a COUPLE of years of 'good times' & then die horrible deaths? Is that all; time? That's all these 2 could have AT BEST? Wow how depressing.",1,13,26,24 December 2011
