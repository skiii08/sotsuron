The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie I've seen since The Avengers
","I remember a time when I thought The Avengers was the worst movie I had even seen. Then Blair Witch came along. 87 of the most painful minutes I have ever spent in a movie theater. The only scare I received was when I look at my wrist to find I had left my watch at home and had no idea how much more of this boring movie I had left to sit through. Don't get me wrong, I really like the idea of this movie. I also like the way it was shot and especially the sound. Here's the problem with this film. Almost nothing happens in the first hour. We see three people that we know nothing about and thus care not about bicker and argue about being lost in the woods. My interest was totally lost when we find that the missing map was kicked down a stream and not snatched by mysterious forces. Maybe if these three lost filmmakers had thought of following the stream they might have gotten out of the woods. I wish I had a stream to get me out of the theater earlier. Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
