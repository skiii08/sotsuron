The Blair Witch Project," Two words:
",Sh*t sandwich. Really bad movie.I give my props to the marketing guys though.Scariest part:  Realizing that you spent 8 bucks on it.,1,1,3,31 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," The most suspenseful part of this movie is waiting for the suspense to start.
",This has to be the worst of all of the overhyped movies in history.  At least the Phantom menace was mildly entertaining.  The most scary part of this movie was realizing that I almost had to go to a non-matinee showing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  Not even a renter.,1,1,3,31 July 1999
