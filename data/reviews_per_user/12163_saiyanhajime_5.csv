Angels & Demons," anti religion? no... but still a bloody good film!
","The Da Vinci Code was a poor film, but this is a great one. Angels and Demons, I thought, was the better book. Whilst The Da Vinci Code sat faffing about with weak theories presented as facts, Angels and Demons got on with a story. I think the action packed adventure across Rome of Angels and Demons translated better onto the screen.I can't help thinking that this film Is getting a lot of negativity for no real reason. Many people seem to have missed part of the plot... The story shows that not only the Catholic Church have become corrupt, but the Illuminati representing science have too. You could interpret the story to to be about man's flaws. This film is in no way anti-God/religion/Catholicism, it's unbiased.So if you're religious and put off this film, frankly I think you should give it a go. You'll probably find something pleasing about it if you're mature enough.",8,4,8,28 May 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Beautiful cheese
","Far too cheesy for it's own good, this movie.The saving grace for me is the character design and the fact that so few movies these days can get away with this level of costume and make up. It's just refreshing for me to see non-computer generated beasties! Great creature design and a truly magical visuals, but it sort of lacked in every other department and fell FLAT on several. However, if like me, you kind of like cheesy stories with monsters, it's pretty awesome.This would have been one of my favourite movies had I watched it when I was about 8, I think.",7,2,3,23 September 2008
Enchanted," Hilarious in places and just dull in others.
","The trailer was brilliant, because every even moderately funny clip was in it. The rest is not great.However, I was amused as a huge fan of Disney movies to see one that takes the Micky (harhar) of itself and all in it's genre on a level that only someone who's grown up with Disney classics will appreciate.Enjoyable, great if you have children. Every little girl will love this movie. But i was upset that there wasn't more for everyone to enjoy, which is what this sort of film should provide.Dragged on a bit for a kids film. There were a few sections where nothing happened for quite a while.",6,3,9,4 January 2008
I Am Legend," It just... lacked something?
","It's easy to push this film off as a bad version of what we've already seen before, but it really did lack something special... At the same time though, it gave something I wasn't expecting.I was impressed with the emotional depth of the film, but left cringing at the appalling (and cheesy) CGI. The way the zombies move, act and look is laughable. They are not scary, visually or emotionally. The other disappointment is that nothing really happens throughout. There is only one scene that I thoroughly enjoyed and I think that was a personal thing anyway.It just isn't what you expect from zombie movie, I guess. But saying that when was it ever marketed as one? It lacked the excitement expected of it and I can't work out what made it a 15. And the majority of the audience, at least at the little cinema in London I work at, seems to feel the same. Older viewers with broader taste seem to enjoy it, but the younger one's are confused.Will Smith's performance is always good, but I think his partner deserves just as much credit in this movie. You will fall in love with Samantha and be disappointed with her human replacement towards the end of the film.I think people who don't usually like monster horror films will be pleasantly surprised to see a film with such emotional depth. People keep harping on about the religious undertone and whilst even for an atheist it was touching, there is far more to this film to appreciate on that same level. But if you're expecting an exciting movie, you might be a lit- really disappointed.",7,0,1,4 January 2008
Beowulf," Fantastic.
","I didn't get to see Beowulf in 3D and I still loved it.I didn't go expecting much, but I knew I'd enjoy it on some levels. I love animated films and I love movie monsters. Can't go far wrong here.I can see what's wrong with it. The characters lacked depth, as did the story. The movie had no meaning or flow. It was very much animation for the sake of animation and blood, gore and sex as much as the rating would allow. And it really is filled to the brim. But that's why it was good, it was exciting, because this isn't what you expect from a 12A... or an animated movie. When I watched this film I was keeping an eye on a noisy group of boys who'd come to see it and amongst the giggles there was stunned silence. The sexuality isn't such that younger viewers will miss, it's blatant, crude and shocking.Grendel was truly scary, there are 2 fantastic scenes where he simply butchers everyone in his path and it's one of the most visually exciting things I've seen in the cinema this year (after the maelstrom scene in Pirates 3). He's probably the character with the most depth in the film too, he's not only scary to look at... but he's emotionally terrifying, out of control and filled with sorrow. His screams will send shivers down your spine.If you're impressed by computer animation and enjoy chaotic action/horror sequences, you'll love this. Might be a bit much for some timid kids, but I'd have LOVED this even more when I was younger.",7,2,4,5 January 2008
