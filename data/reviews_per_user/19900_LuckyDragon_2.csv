The Legend of Bagger Vance," Fore stars
","In a year where there haven't been that many films to get excited about, The Legend of Bagger Vance is one that is.  Robert Redford has taken two good actors, Matt Damon and Will Smith, and made them GREAT actors.  This film doesn't need sex, action, or an overabundance of curse words to be successful, it's as simple and yet, as wickedly complex as the game of golf itself. I won't give anything away, but this is a wild ride of emotions that will keep your attention right up until the credits start to roll.
The low part of this film is Charlize Theron's performance as Matt Damon's former love.  At times, it seems as if she has forgotten that she is playing a Savannah belle and drops the accent.   However, if you ignore her faults and remember that she's not the star, she's just a double bogey in an otherwise perfect round.This is an amazing film that golfers and non-golfers will enjoy.  A definite hole-in-one.",8,0,1,3 November 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A big disappointment
","Like everyone else in the western world, I couldn't wait to see the prequel to the Star Wars movies that I loved as a kid.  I was so disappointed in this movie.  Acting hit a new low, and the new characters didn't live up to the standards set by Han, Leia and Luke in the old movie.  Jar Jar is annoying and needs to take a long walk off a short pier in the next movie. Plus, it didn't take long to figure out what was going to happen.  So maybe it wasn't fully Lucas's fault.  I mean, how concerned are you  going to be when Obi Wan is 'fighting to the death' with Darth Maul when you remember that Obi Wan is in 'A New Hope'?  This movie is a huge disappointment when compared to the first three.  The special effects are amazing, but other than that it's not worth it.",1,59,115,10 January 2000
