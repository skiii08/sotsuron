The Terminator," I'll Be Back!
",'The Terminator' has been the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie I have ever seen! My favorite part is when the Terminator was saying 'I'll Be Back!' I also like the part when he was grabbing those punks' clothes to wear them and the cool part is when he got some guns at the gun store. This movie is a must-see for any Arnold Schwarzenegger fans. The Terminator is an excellent movie overall and has been one of the best excuses of the film. **** out of **** stars. 10/10 stars.,10,0,0,1 December 2001

Spider-Man," Excellent! One of the best movies I have seen this year!
","'Spider-Man' is one of the best movies of 2002! Tobey Maguire stars as young man who got bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes Spider-Man to fight villians.

If you like Marvel Comics, you'll definitely like this movie!10/10",10,0,0,12 May 2002
Schindler's List," Excellent!
","'Schindler's List' without a doubt has been one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too. 'Schindler's List' is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.10/10",10,12,18,25 April 2002
Patton," A Must See!!!
","'Patton' is a movie starting George C. Scott who plays General George S. Patton, a famous tank commander in World War II. He is a great in that movie and I'm glad he won an Oscar for it. I saw it on DVD tonight and I was impressed. All the 'Bastard' and 'Son Of A Bitch' scenes made me laugh. 'Patton' is one of the best movies I have ever seen! You have got to see it. You will love it. I do love that movie. That is all I can say for today. **** out of **** and 10 out of 10 stars.",10,2,6,12 February 2002
Dumb and Dumber," The funniest movie I have ever seen!!
",This is my all-time favorite Jim Carrey movie. I laughed really hard when Jeff Daniels' stomach was churning when he was driving. The bathroom scene is also funny. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are both very funny in this movie. I highly recommend it. **** out of **** stars and 10 out of 10 stars.,10,0,2,3 January 2002
Rocky," Stallone's best!
","Rocky has been one of the best Sylvester Stallone movies I have ever seen. This movie is all about boxing. The ice skating scene is my favorite part in this cool movie. I also like the part when Rocky (Stallone) was talking to Adrian (Shire) while he was walking to his home. In my opinion, Rocky has been one of the excellent excuses of the film overall. **** out of **** stars. 10 out of 10 stars.",10,0,0,21 December 2001
Rocky III," Another Great Stallone Movie!!
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 'Rocky III' is another sequel from the first and second 'Rocky'. It's about Mr. T. wanting to have a match with Rocky(Stallone). It's also about the statue of Rocky standing in Philadelphia. It's sad when Mickey died after the boxing match in the middle of the movie. It was great when Rocky(Stallone) befriended Apollo Creed(Weathers) by working and exercising together for another boxing match with Mr. T. And by the way, 'Eye Of The Tiger' was a great song in this cool movie. 'Rocky III' has been one of the greatest Stallone movies ever created. I Highly Recommend It. **** out of **** stars and 10 out of 10 stars.",10,6,7,15 January 2002
Jaws," Excellent!
","'Jaws' has been one of the best movies I have ever seen from the 70s. It is about a giant shark swimming near the beach and people were running away from it because it is very dangerous, so Martin Brody(Roy Scheider), Quint(Robert Shaw), and Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) went on the boat to find and kill the shark. I was thinking of buying the DVD and I did and I was happy that I bought it. I love this movie because Steven Spielberg directed that movie and Roy Scheider stars in it too. He's a great actor. 'Jaws' is a movie that is deserved to be seen anytime. Enjoy!10/10",10,1,2,17 March 2002
Raging Bull," The ultimate boxing movie!
","'Raging Bull' is one of the best boxing films in the 1980s. It deals with an autobiography of the 1940s boxer Jake La Motta(Robert De Niro). Robert De Niro is excellent in it, same with Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty. I am glad they won an Oscar for that movie, same with the director Martin Scorsese. 'Raging Bull' is my all-time favorite Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese movie without a doubt and is not to be missed at all. Excellent film and performances. I love it! Tragic Ending with Jake La Motta's closing monologue. 10/10",10,1,1,19 March 2002

The Breakfast Club," Awesome 80's!!
","'The Breakfast Club' is a movie about those five high school students getting Saturday detention. Emilio Estevez plays a jock, Anthony Michael Hall plays a nerd, Judd Nelson plays a criminal, Ally Sheedy plays a weirdo, and Molly Ringwald plays a prom queen. This movie is very funny. My favorite part is when Judd Nelson was hiding inside the top school roof from the principal, but fell down. That was funny. See this movie, it's great. You won't be disappointed. **** out of **** stars and 10 out of 10 stars.",10,0,1,24 January 2002
