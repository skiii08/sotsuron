Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Eye candy, but not much else
","One of my greatest movie memories is seeing Star Wars for the first time in the old State Theater in Springfield, Ohio. That film focused on people and had a strong story and was something new--something we had never seen before. I knew that this film couldn't hope to live up to it's predecessor, but I didn't think it would be so disappointing. It's little more than a shiny toy--a big screen video game--all flash and no substance. The film looks and sounds great, as always, but there doesn't seem to be any heart behind it. Just the desire to sell more action figures. The CGI characters and sets just lack something. Everything is too perfect. I have no doubt that it'll become one of the, if not THE highest grossing picture of all time but it'll just show how easy to please the public has become. Well, I'm not going to wait in line for Episodes two or three. It won't be worth it.",5,0,1,20 May 1999
The Mummy," All wrapped up and no place to go
","This is a fun movie. Not a great movie, but a fun movie. It shows the signs of too many hands in the mix. If there was a single cliche they did not utilize for this film, I'm not sure what it was. About the only things left from the 1932 'Mummy', of which this is supposed to be a remake, are a couple of names and several paraphrased lines of dialogue. Oh, and the fact that it takes place in Egypt.  Arnold Vosloo is quite enjoyable as the mummy, in both CGI and human form. Too bad he's not on screen more. There are some 'big' gags in the film, involving huge set pieces (i.e.; the collapsing library) that are rather uninvolving--the full house audience I saw this with barely chuckled as the bookcases fell, domino style. All in all, it was fun to watch, even though I couldn't help thinking of all the movies they borrowed stuff from--if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then this is one of the most sincere movies of all time!",5,0,0,10 May 1999
The Iron Giant," Shame on Warner Bros!
","The Iron Giant is a great work of art and entertainment. From the first frame, the amount of love and hard work that went into making this film is highly evident. That's why I say shame on Warner Bros. for making this great movie and not doing EVERYTHING in their corporate power to insure its success! One of the few good movies in 1999, and it gets buried. Go figure.",10,1,5,24 November 1999
Shrek," Bleck! What a waste of hard drive space.
","Before I saw this film, a friend mentioned that if all the fart jokes were removed, the film would be about five minutes long. I figured, he being the cynical fellow he is, that he was kidding. He wasn't. John Lassiter and the folks at Pixar have nothing to fear from the adolescents that crafted this 'thing'. Possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen, made all the worse by people telling me how great it is. This may have started out as a great script--it is a great premise and Wm. Steig has always been one of my favorite cartoonist/authors. It seems that somewhere along the line 'the powers that be' decided it needed to be 'pepped up' a bit and wherever there wasn't a funny bit (which is most of the film, come to think of it), a fart, or a reference to a fart or a bodily fluid or odor would be added. Even 'Monty Python & the Holy Grail' or 'Blazing Saddles' had more restraint! I notice that an entry for Shrek 2 has been posted. Swell. Now they can use all the fart jokes they left out last time.",1,1,2,23 January 2002
The Sixth Sense," 'Is there something you want to tell me?'
","I quote the line from the film above because that moment in the film has stuck in my mind. I first want to offer a HUGE 'Thank You!' to M. Night Shyamalan, the director. He has succeeded in making a modern 'horror film' without resorting to gore and CGI. This is a ghost story in league with The (original)Haunting (1963), The Uninvited, The Changeling, etc. It relies almost solely on the power of the actors to render its chills. There are still some genuine jolts--my wife practically broke my arm at one point as a mysterious figure swished by the lens. Bruce Willis is his most un-Bruce like, and he's great: soft spoken, gentle, emotional. Haley Joel Osment is the real thing--not a 'child actor' but a warm, human, frightened little boy. And finally, a denoument that caught me off guard like a slap in the face by a hand from the grave. So don't sit here reading this drivel--go see it!! In the theatre, if possible, surround by several hundred others.",10,0,0,9 August 1999
