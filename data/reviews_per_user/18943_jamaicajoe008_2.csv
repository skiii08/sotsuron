Skyfall," Skip this Bond, and wait for the next one - waste of time/money
","I saw this movie in India on Nov 1.The whole premise of customizing Bond for his audience completely fails the notion of Bond. Yes, most of his fans must now have experienced a dent in their games: Bond can't shoot straight, fails fitness tests etc. Most fans have grown older: Bond lives now on pills. Most fans moved away from ancestral homes and wondering about it (as all people do in their 50s): Bond revisits his ancestral home. And then Sam hopes to give them a way out by a Bond who can miraculously suddenly start shooting straight, becomes full of stamina, and decides to let go of the past (his ancestral home) for the sake of the future.From a character perspective, Bond was never about reality. Bond was always about seemingly real fantasy. No one in their 40s, 50s, 60s need Bond to validate their problems..they need Bond to obfuscate their problems - show ways of how those problems do not exist. Give something for the men to look up to and strive for.From a story and action perspective, the movie sucked. There was no story, no continuity, no meaning. Craig does not come through as a distinguished gentleman from a posture perspective (one of the reviewers aptly described his standing pose as if he was urinating).The humor was good through the movie, the idea of bringing that old car back was good, but did not last long. The climax was pathetic.Except for the opening sequence, rest of the movie was full of crap.And then, what's with moving the rolling target-finder sequence to the end? what was the purpose of it? In the past, having this sequence in the beginning set the tone for the rest of the movie : it signaled to the audience to settle down, that they are watching a 'Bond' movie, and to expect a high standard of entertainment. Even if the movie were below average (like Tomorrow Never Dies), the audience could appreciate the movie a shade better because they viewed it with the Bond glasses. But having the target-finder sequence at the end wasted the whole movie. People could not connect to Bond through the movie, and when, in the end, the target-finder sequence showed up, they were too frustrated to care.In the next movie, I think they should do some serious re-thinking of how to get Bond back on track, and avoid showing his legs if Craig still plays it.",1,19,39,9 November 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Don't waste your money
","The movie is neither exciting nor suspenseful nor entertaining. About the only interesting scene was the motorcycle chase well into the movie. The opening scene was so painfully purported, it set a bad start for rest of the movie. I mean, what was Ethan doing while the plane was getting loaded and taxing? he just shows up in time to jump on the taxing plane. There are plenty of loosely tied special effects that fail to excite as they are not adding to a gripping plot. Context not set properly for anything to make the audience invest in the moment. There is just too much of global back-n- forth in a highly purported fashion not truly relevant to story or plot, which itself is pretty much non-existent. Many situations in the story have been wasted by the director to generate excitement. The whole IMF have been presented as a set of bumbling idiots, enough for audience to laugh at them but not feel or root for them. Ghost protocol was so much better.",1,29,67,31 July 2015
