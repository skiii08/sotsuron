The Blair Witch Project," Finally a movie worthy of an 8 dollar ticket price.
",This film is frightening.  It's not the visuals that make it but the lack thereof in much of the film.   The film relies on the audience's imagination rather than expensive effects to scare the audience and is very successful. The audio in many scenes is absolutely chilling.  This is a very well done and thought out film.  Much better than the majority of the 'Horror' movies churned out by Hollywood lately.  Where films like 'Anaconda' and 'Event Horizon' fail with a huge budget and special effect this movie succeeds with a very low budget and NO special effects.,9,1,1,2 August 1999
