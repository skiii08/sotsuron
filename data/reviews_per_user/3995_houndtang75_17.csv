"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Predictable, but likable
","Yes, it is predictable as anything but 'Run Fat Boy Run' is an enjoyable comedy, with Simon Pegg basically playing Shaun again as the amiable loser who comes good and wins the girl. Pegg's range is not wide but he is a very likable performer, and I personally found this film preferable to the somewhat disappointing 'Hot Fuzz'. There's also a decent supporting cast, with Dylan Moran (also from 'Shaun of the Dead') amusing as Pegg's friend and trainer, although Hank Azaria's nasty Yank love-rival character is a bit stereotypical. Director David Schwimmer, who must have become buddies with Pegg on the fairly obscure 'Big Nothing', has a blink and you'll miss him cameo towards the end.",8,9,15,15 September 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino gets his mojo back, baby
","After the self-indulgence of the Kill Bill films and the drivel that was Death Proof, my expectations were not high for Inglorious Basterds. Trailers and reviews did little to change my mind. Only on the recommendation of a friend did I go to see it, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellent film - tense, funny, compelling. There are some great set-pieces, such as the opening scene of Landa questioning the farmer and the scene in the bierkeller. The ensemble cast is almost uniformly good, with only Mike Myers awful 'Austin Powers at 60' cameo striking a false note, and even Brad Pitt effective in his role. Inglorious Basterds shows that Tarantino has, despite his own best efforts, not lost the talent that produced Pulp Fiction and that when he reigns in his ego he can be a great director.",10,3,11,31 August 2009
Oldboy," Masterpiece?
","Probably the best of the recent South Korean cinema boom, Oldboy is a compelling drama/thriller with an outstanding lead performance from Choi Min Sik. The premise of a man imprisoned for 15 years for no apparent reason is frightening but this is just the beginning of a series of horrors. At once scary, funny and poignant Oldboy is easily one of the best films of the last ten years, only the dreaded prospect of an American remake (possibly starring Nicholas Cage!!) leaves a bad taste in the mouth. The director's other films - JSA, Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and Lady Vengeance (the latter two part of a 'revenge' trilogy along with Oldboy) are not in the same class as this but still worth seeking out.",10,10,70,17 April 2006
Ocean's Twelve," Self-indulgent old twaddle
","Ocean's Eleven was a somewhat indulgent jolly-boys outing of a movie, but it worked for what it was and proved an entertaining light thriller. Ocean's 12 is one of the most self-indulgent films ever made, just an excuse for the 'guys' to have a laugh at the audience's expense. The scene where Julia Roberts as Tess impersonates Julia Roberts with the aid of Bruce Willis as himself ranks as one of the worst scenes in recent cinema history; the scene where the cocky French thief dodges laser beams is pretty resistable also. I couldn't recount the plot of the film as the script, editing and direction are fairly incoherent, and there are so many different characters involved (as if 11 wasn't enough!) that it is hard to keep track of them. I wouldn't describe myself as a fan of Catherine Zeta Jones but she is about the only bright spot in the film.",2,0,0,17 July 2006
Knocked Up," A bit disappointing...
","Having loved 'Anchorman' and 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' I was really looking forward to 'Knocked Up', but it didn't deliver in the same way those two did. That's not to say it's a bad film, just nothing exceptional. It has some good laughs and funny performances but could have done with a bit of script-editing. There was also no chemistry between Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl which made their decision to stay together seem a bit implausible, unlike the well-played relationship between Steve Carell and Catherine Keener in '40 Year Old Virgin'. Ben's instant transformation from slobby flatmate to job and spacious apartment was all a bit unlikely also. All in all a nice enough movie but don't expect a classic.",7,0,3,28 August 2007
Shutter Island," A massive slice of A-grade hokum
","Shutter Island is one of the biggest loads of old tosh I've seen in a long time. The twist - if you can call it that - can be guessed from the trailer and must have been seen at least 47 movies before this one. There is a strange, artificial feel to the whole film, with the crazily doom-laden music the icing on the bizzaro cake. How this 70s B-movie script attracted Scorsese, DiCaprio, Ruffalo etc who know - perhaps it was just an excuse to camp it up for a while. That said, it entertains in its way, despite its overlength and awkward plotting. Truly a bit of a curio, no doubt it will become something of a cult 'guilty pleasure' down the line.",6,2,4,14 March 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Best comedy for many a moon
","Given the generally dire state of cinematic comedy it is not saying that much to call 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' the best comedy of the 21st century (so far) but it probably is. Indeed it's probably the best since the inexplicably under-rated 'Kingpin'. For comedy to really work it has to come from character and not just from situation and what sets this apart from 'Wedding Crashers' and even the mighty 'Anchorman' is that the characters are genuine and there is real pathos (although not sentimentality). Steve Carell is excellent as the hero, and it is surprising and refreshing that his virginity, whilst used for comedic purposes, ultimately isn't sneered at. The supporting actors were all well-cast and the movie, while a shade overlong, managed to maintain a pretty high level of laughter throughout - the chest hair scene is a classic.",9,1,4,27 August 2005
Collateral," Shere Hite
","I don't often post reviews on here but having seen the ludicrously high ratings this film has been getting I felt I had to lower the average a bit. The shame of it is that Collateral actually started quite well, for the first 45 minutes or so it was quite intriguing, with some amusingly black comic moments. Then it just went berserk, with each scene more implausible than the last. Cruise turns into an unkillable Terminator-type figure and the mild mannered cab driver fools gangsters into thinking he's a hit-man and then becomes an all-action hero. Sorry, but this was tosh. Michael Mann must be one of the most over-rated directors and Tom Cruise adds yet another blockbuster turkey to his increasingly long list - Days of Thunder, Far and Away, Minority Report, Mission Impossible I and II - has he ever actually made a decent film? Collateral certainly isn't it I'm afraid.",1,21,37,25 April 2005
Bad Teacher," Not Bad
","Bad Teacher, the title and theme of which seems to pay homage to Bad Santa, is one of the best comedies of the last couple of years. Not saying much I hear you cry and that's true but this is enjoyable from start to finish and Cameron Diaz proves herself an excellent comedienne. Also very good is the supporting cast particularly Lucy Punch as the relentlessly perky but somewhat creepy rival teacher Amy Squirrel. It would be intriguing to see a sequel featuring Amy bringing her own 'brand of zany energy to the disadvantaged students of Malcolm X High'. Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel also do a good job as potential suitors for Diaz's bimbo teacher.",7,21,40,17 June 2011
No Country for Old Men," ?
","Joel and Ethan Coen's 'No Country for Old Men' has proved to be one of the year's most critically acclaimed films, with a raft of Oscar nominations adding to its apparent lustre. On viewing though, one has to ask what all the fuss is about.The story contrives to be straightforward and opaque at the same time; trailer-trash Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon a corpse and a bag full of money in the Texan desert. As always happens in the movies, he decides to keep it for himself, thus attracting the attention of the extremely sinister Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem sporting an equally sinister pudding bowl haircut). The first three-quarters of the film are essentially about Moss trying to evade Chigurh's murderous clutches, whilst folksy but ineffectual Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) follows two steps behind. This section of the film works well as a thriller, with some tense and exciting scenes as Chigurh relentlessly pursues the resourceful Moss. However, much remains rather unclear; for instance the origin of the money is never really made clear and a bounty-hunter type character (a nice cameo from Woody Harrelson) enters and exits the story quickly and rather pointlessly.Had 'No Country' continued in the thriller vein for its two hour running time, then it would have been a strong entry in the genre, but those Oscar nods would still have been rather mystifying. However the film literally loses the plot in the last quarter, with the abrupt, off-screen death of a central character and a slow, meandering and ultimately rather pointless finale. All in all, 'No Country For Old Men' must be one of the more disappointing and over-rated films of recent years.",6,4,7,31 January 2008
District 9," Certainly one of the best SF films of recent years
","I didn't know quite what to expect from District 9, but it's a diverting film and the South African setting and characters sets it apart from Hollywood films (where a happy ending is usually guaranteed) and makes it a more unpredictable experience. The performances are very good for the genre with Wikus a great flawed hero. The SFX are also great with the CGI work much more realistic than has been the norm in recent times. The only thing that kept it off a 9/10 for me was that it did descend into a bit of a chase movie in the last half hour or so. The ending is neatly done though and a sequel can surely not be far off.",8,0,1,20 September 2009
Stardust," Some magic in it...
","For some reason I had no great desire to see Stardust, the reviews were lukewarm and the trailers didn't look too interesting (too much Ricky Gervais!), so it was only tonight when it came on TV that I watched it. I was pleasantly surprised; Stardust is a very enjoyable fantasy film, not unworthy of comparison with The Princess Bride. The story maintains interest over almost two hours and satisfies as good fairy tales should. The cast is strong with the beautiful Claire Danes doing a rather good English accent, Charlie Cox a likable hero and Michelle Pfeiffer and Mark Strong appropriately hissable baddies. A candidate for most under-rated film of the last year or so.",9,2,3,13 December 2008
Groundhog Day," Up there with the best
","Groundhog Day, a film that was released with no great fanfare in 1993, has taken on the mantle of a classic in recent years. It's a well-deserved title as it is one of those rare films you can watch no matter how many times you've seen it and you are always glad when it turns up on TV. Bill Murray, who pretty much took a 10 year sabbatical from major movie roles after this film, is at the height of his powers and conveys the contrasting sides to Phil Connors character brilliantly. Andie MacDowell is charming as the object of his affections, and Ned Ryerson is a memorable cameo from Stephen Tobolowsky. An 'It's a Wonderful Life' for the 21st Century? Could be. Certainly one of the few truly excellent films of the last 15 years.",10,1,3,3 March 2005
Pulp Fiction," Contender for best film of all time
","It's up there. One of those rare, rare films that you can re-watch many times without boredom, and that you can discover new things in on each viewing, Tarantino came up with something special when he wrote the screenplay for this one. The casting was mostly excellent, with Travolta, Jackson and Willis ideal in their roles. There are some flaws; 'The Bonnie Situation' is a little weaker than the other stories but the diner scene packs a punch; Maria De Medeiros was incredibly annoying as Bruce Willis' girlfriend and Tarantino shows that he's a better writer/director than he is an actor but most of the film is brilliant. The sheer lunacy of the pawnshop S&M kidnap/rape and Christopher Walken's monologue are amongst the highlights. Unsurprisingly Tarantino has found it difficult to follow 'Pulp Fiction'; 'Jackie Brown' was a solid, if overlong thriller but 'Kill Bill' was self-indulgent to say the least.",10,0,2,3 June 2006
The Holiday," Cheesy, corny, predictable.....but I liked it!
","'The Holiday' has a script that must have practically written itself, there's absolutely nothing new here, and it is reminiscent of quite a few other films, particularly 'Love Actually'. However, it is most entertaining and surely that in itself is an achievement these days - it's the kind of film that could have been made in the 1940s. The cast is impeccably typecast, Cameron Diaz is looking a little haggard but Kate Winslet is luminous. There's also a sweet supporting turn from the spritely nonagenarian Eli Wallach (who will forever be Tuco in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'). Jude Law plays the part he almost always plays - incredibly handsome, really nice bloke - and Jack Black plays the part he almost always plays - cheeky but cuddly bloke. A nice film.",8,2,5,15 December 2006
Downfall," Brilliant
","Downfall is truly an excellent film. One of those rare pictures where you can forget you are watching actors and actually believe in them as the real people they are playing. Bruno Ganz is uncanny as Hitler, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine. There is no music, just the dull thud of the Russian shells in the background. Although there have been many war films, the fall of Berlin, one of the most dramatic events of the 20th Century, has been neglected by filmmakers. It's good that it is a German film that has brought this period to the forefront again. I think every secondary school pupil should have to see this film, it is a piece of moving history as well as a gripping piece of cinema.",10,2,4,8 April 2005
Paths of Glory," One of the greats
","'Paths of Glory' is one of those rare films that you can come across on TV halfway through and be gripped to the end no matter how many times you have seen it. Easily Kubrick's best film, his later pictures were brilliantly shot but emotionally empty, it also features career-best performances from pretty much everyone concerned. Even Kirk Douglas, not the world's greatest actor, is highly effective in his role as the compassionate Colonel Dax. George Macready and Adolphe Menjou, two fine actors who were only rarely given worthy roles, are excellent as the two despicable Generals. Of course the film is unsubtle but with a story such as this subtlety is not really possible; the message is obvious but no less moving for that.",10,3,5,24 September 2006
