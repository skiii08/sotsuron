The Avengers," Avengers Hulk and 2008 Hulk
","I enjoyed watching Avengers. I liked the hulk that came on the 2008 film better than the Avengers. He looked more real and lean. Avengers Hulk looked more bulking. Being in the gym as a weightlifter and a runner, I know how a runners physique looks like. Hulk runs,crushes, jumps, and does a lot of running. His physical ability to me does not fit with a bulky look. I hope your future movies get more thought before putting on film. Can not wait to see your future films. I hope you keep the same actors for these films. Actor that played in Avengers was more appealing to me than the 2008 film. I like your films when its 50/50 on solving the problem and action.",Null,0,2,8 October 2014
