The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project
","A movie that caused so many controversial critics back in 1994. People stating that it is completelty rubbish while other arguing that's it is a new piece of art. Time passed and this movies has actually become 'classic' -cult horror movie, opening the way to many hand-cam horror films afterwards. 2 sequels have been already released after the release of this first one.",9,0,3,1 September 2019

Justice League," Justice League
","All DC heroes in just one movie? How fun does this sound? 5 x DC super heroes (Batman, Superman ect) gather to fight against the ultimate evil that wants to conquer the world. I know; that doesn't sound like the most sophisticated movie to go to next Cannes festival but still can meet your basic movie instincts. A lot of action & good special effects to accompany your huge pop-corn basket.",6,0,3,1 September 2019
The Revenant," The Revenant
","Loved this play. Once again Alejandro Inarritu (aka Babel, Beautiful) did his magic and offered us an excellent movie. I wouldn't expect anything less than that from Inarritu.

A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place
","Once again, a great movie trailer convince you to go to cinema only to realise that this is actually more of a rubbish movie. From the moment it starts, you realisie that there are a lot of things that do not make sense and there is no connection between them but were just there to help the story moving on. Predictable story from start until the end, having low budget & bad acting.",2,2,6,1 September 2019

Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast
","The absolute classic Disney animation film Beauty and the Beast, brought back in the big screen this time as a film with actors. Emma Watson does deliver excellently the role of the Beauty and she is slowly but steadily being moving to the first class new actors. A beautiful film for a romantic night out with music songs from the original film.",7,0,1,1 September 2019
Black Panther," Black Panther

Mother!," Mother
","This is a movie that you will either love or hate. I am on the side of the absolute love. Darren Aronofsky is my number one director and once again he didn't dissapoint me at all. Don't stay on what you just see but try to explore what lies underneath each scene. A dark, full of metaphors masterpiece.",10,2,3,1 September 2019
