"I, Tonya"," One of the greatest Docu-Drama I have ever seen!
","Margot Robbie return in theater since Suicide Squad (2016), she produces and acts as the leading in the new docu-drama about Tonya Harding! I,Tonya is that kind of movie you laugh at you have fun at yet you still feel bad and question yourselves..... The publics knows what they are going to watch, yet you still question yourself on Tonya Harding story. It an excellent biography and needs to be seen by everyone love it or not it has to be listened to! Acting: 10/10: Amazing cast!!!! Margot Robbie is stunning as Tonya Harding she gives those intense scenes where she needs to handle 2 feelings and the way Robbie does it feels so true it gives goosebumbs, she deserves and Oscar nominations maybe even an Oscar that take on Harding was really really well done! Then we have Allison Janney starring as LaVona Golden the mother of Tonya, I personnaly think that there is no way someone will be able to win that Oscar other than Janney herself, she was amazing one of the greatest supporting performances of the past 10 years, there is no way she won't win that Oscar! Then we have great actors who played well too but were simply behind the success of Robbie and Janney, yet Sebastian Stan delivered a great performances and pretty much the same from the rest of the cast !DIrections: 10/10: The directions is done perfectly not a scene is wasted, the interview scenes we have during the whole movie are well placed and great ! Everyone involved in the directions and productions of this movie did a good job. it unpredictable and good, plus it tells a deep sad story about some tragic events and makes us think for the victims, it graphic but not to much just great enough! Margot improvement in the productions of the movie is great it really feels like she came up with everything you see it in the way the story is told and by how she plays Tonya!Humour: 10/10: Not too many jokes, but that's good this movie is mostly a biography about some tragic shitt! Yet when there are jokes they sure are funny and well-placed ! CGI or Visuals: 6/10: That's were the movie kind of felts down, I loved the movie and nothing about it except those awfully cringe worthy CGI scenes where Tonya skates, it feels like a videogame yet don't judge it too much, it's not that bad and it doesn't matter at all, still they could have been better but I really don't give much of a fuck.... THe 90's style was well done and great !Costumes and Makeup: 10/10: Some really well made costumes, that looked exaclty like what Tonya Harding was wearing at her competitions back in the days. For the makeup it was done well not much to say it since it was good and not gonna lie it doesn't matter that much, oh and the hairstyle on Robbie looked exaclty the same as Haring well done indeed!Enjoyment: 10/10: Was really hyped wanted to see Robbie again and loved that trailer, yet the movie even delivered more that what I was hoping which made me fall in love with the film after it's first 10min! Great Docu-Drama best one I have seen in a while ! Original, Funny, Epic this is I,Tonya! Thanks for reading my review, have a good day and give I,Tonya a watch !",9,1,1,25 January 2018
Molly's Game," Chastain's game !
","Nothing was really bad at some point in this movie yet expect from the great narration and the poker game, there wasn't much fun out of the movie. Molly's Game is one of those great biography movie with a great cast and a well told story, yet it ain't The Wolf of Wall Street, it tried it's best to look like it but wasn't as funny or trhilling and fun as The Wolf Wall Street.... still don't miss understand me I know these two movies are really different, I just find the main vision in both of them kind of simillar. THE GREAT-!:Chastain, this movie is chastain's movie, she is incredible as Molly Bloom, she knows her character and her vision on the character is huge she gives a lot of efforts on her character. Still she ain't the only great actor in it, Idris Elba gives a great performances as Molly's Lawyer. We add Micheal Cera, Chris O'Dowd, Brian d'Arcy James and Bill Camp who also played well and were great poker gambits ! The poker scenes is another great thing about this movie, helped by the cast and the characters developpement we had some great excitting, funny poker game.
With great narations by Chastain and some really nice transitions with a zoom at every players face those poker scene's have to be the best scenes out of this movie.The characters, as small as some were they were nice, such as a small cameo by a Stranger Things star know as Joe Kerry who played a small great character, these small character are fun and well put in the story. Bill Camp, Brian d'Arcy James and Micheal Cera characters were really good, they all had their story and really felt like people every knows in is life, such as the poker adict, the wise thief, etc, you get it....
THE BAD-!:Runtime, it was too long way too long some scenes were boring and way too long and unecessary.....Predictable, the ending is predictable and does not leave a mark in your hearts, like I mean at this point we are all like ''ok cool, it over wow that was an obvious bad ending'' .That's pretty much it, it's a great film, a well-made biography that needs time to be taken seriously even tho it mean seem slow and boring it ain't some stuff is really enjoyable and you have to watch it for Chastain performance! 
8/10 for me !",7,0,3,17 January 2018

Justice League," Not judged by what it offers!
","Justice League and Alien:Convenant were both huge blockbusters that were super underrated! They were both not a masterpiece at some point but they were both popcorn movies really enjoyable and thrilling with some great leading ! Yet they both had problems wheiter on the directions. This review is on Justice League so sorry for the Alien:Convenant Cameo.
Justice League was a movie us fans of comics and supeheros have all been waiting so long for Justice League to finnaly have it chances on the big screen.
It wasn't has good has we expected it to be. But what can we really expect from a movie that switched director midle production? My point is has a fan it was an honour and a dream to see the League and I enjoyed the movie I came out with a smile on my face and was happy that I had lived such a fun experience an experience I had waited so much for.Acting: 8/10: The actors all had chemistry together. We can all see they had fun making the movie! And it turned out to be good, Jason Momoa is the best Aquaman we could of hoped for, Gal Gadot is a stunning and a perfect Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher brings a great character in Cyborg and he really looks honored to play Cyborg, Ezra Miller is a funny and touching Flash, Henry Cavill is has good has expected, Ciara Hinds has a magnificent voice, Ben Affleck so there is my -2 out of 10..... DC fans which I am may bash me oh that -2 but I am saying it out loud I don't like Ben at all.... yall can say whatever you want I still don't like him.... I miss Bale and Keaton. Directions: 7/10: It felt so rushed (and it was) the runtime doesn't help at all. I mean we all know what happen to Snyder it is a tragedy and kinda is the main problem in the direction. Whedon taking over may not have been the best .... because his vision and Snyder's are completly different on many levels. But he did what he can so I still thank him for that .... yet he still made terrible choices and this movie was a Snyder movie and he changed the vision of it. But for a movie with two completly different directors the directions turned just fine for me.Cgi: 5/10: That Superman moustache cgi was cringe-worthy..... the final battle cgi was bad and the cgi on Steppenwolf was pretty bad too...... But the cgi on Flash was pretty damn incredible ! And Cyborg suit was actually a suprise since it was actually amazing! Music: 9/10: The Music was fun !!! Even though we haven't really have all of it since half was cut still the results were great the music used matched every scenes!Characters: 10/10: One thing we can all agree on is how DCEU has a touch with their characters such as in Suicide Squad or Justice League both had problems but their characters weren't one of them problems.Place in the DCEU: 7/10: It was a great follow-up to Batman vs Superman.The story was well placed for sequels.... yet it came out after one of the year finest movie: Wonder Woman........ which was a hard movie to compete with so expections were even higher than before for Justice League. But the biggest problem was that we din't really got to know all of our characters the movie came out to early.... we should of explored the characters a little more before making a movie about all of them joining together...Enjoyment: 10/10: If you're a DC fan or a person looking for a fun time well Justice League is November answer! It with cheer you up with a great smile. Don't find it's mistake just Watch it and enjoy it ! That's a 8/10 for me ! Thank for reading my review! Sorry for my English .... not main language...",7,0,0,13 December 2017
Insidious," Seen this at a young age and regret it ! Still marks me after all those years ! It's Terrfying!
",This movie is so freacking scary it doesn't make sense! It's does go for the worst towards the end ..... the red demon isn't scary in so scenes and he becomes mess up. But the whole rest is so scary you guys don't understand ! The supsence we have at the start ..... the fact of never getting attacked or anything just lots of strange shitt happening makes the movie even scarier! if you don't want to sleep watch this movie!,10,0,0,23 December 2017
A Quiet Place," DONT BUY POPCORN!
","2018's new horror flick a Quiet Place, is a great addition to the horror genre, with lots of memorable scenes, amazing performances, great script, a moving story while being an intense thrilller that will keep you on the edge of your seat !The movie still as some really small mistakes, like some dumb desicions during an apocalypse, unnecessary scenes and not as many scares as I thougt there would be. Besides that, the movie is incredible, it's intense, quiet, and shows how much parents will do to keep their family safe. If I may add a side note, DONT BUY POPCORN, it's kind of ruins the film, the movie is so quiet that the theater itself needs to be quiet to have the best A Quiet Place experience! It's an 7,5/10 for me, some stuff where missing and it had some flaws, yet the movie definelty is a game-changer for the horror genre, and makes us care about it's characters. Solid story, great performances, great cinemathography, A Quiet Place is a must see for horror fans ! Don't make a sound !",8,1,3,8 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Follow the daily life of Elio !
","Okay... that was a weird yet so real, Call me by your name starring both amazing actors that slayed this movie, Timothée Chalamet as Elio and Armie Hammer as Oliver! The images, the way the movie is filmed is incredible, some long shot at the nature are wonderful and makes you want to visit these wonderful places! The acting is just so so so good, both actors had too do some really hard stuff in the movie and they did it incredibly, their chemistry and all their scenes together are really excellent, both actors need to win or be nominated for an Oscar! The music itself is relaxing and fits right in with the story itself, with the places, it just fits perfectly and makes this movie a true masterpiece! Plus that credits roll scene is original not seen and great, it really shows some deep emotions!",10,1,2,21 January 2018
Coco," Pixar's new Toy Story?
","Can't say much about this film without spoilling it, so let's just say what a Masterpiece, Pixar's new movie Coco is as good as our old classic Toy Story. It's so good, this is a movie for everyone. The animation is gorgeous, the characters are so well written, every scene is pur fun, the tradition and the moral and both delightful, and after all those years we finnaly get a villain in animation as good as Lozo in Toy Story 3. What a great piece of film! Was supposed to see Lady Bird but it was full so I had to watch Coco and honestly I have no regrets. This movie is in my all time animation movie favorites. You people should rush to the theater to either see Coco or Paddington 2 with your kids both are some of the best family movie you will get for years to come!",10,0,1,31 January 2018
The Shape of Water," One of Guillermo finest work !
","Just saw The Shape of Water and it a masterpiece.
This movie is so beautiful it so tragic and magical.
The actors are amazing and deliver some really good performances, performances that's actually deserve to be nominated. The visuals were stunning the quality of the image was epic. The direction was done perfectly. One of the weirdest but most beautiful love story I have ever seen. This movie was a dream I felt different watching this movie. The romance was touching the characters were so charming. The gory stuff was really welll done it followed everything, it felt like a real life situations even if the main story was about a monster. This movie was just so well done it deserve itself a nomination at the Oscar for best Picture ! Watch it, it can be hard to watch but it beautiful just give it a try and give it time it no Action movie, it a good movie a must see !",9,44,81,20 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," Franco Franco Franco you're tearing me apart !
","This bizzare take on the novel written by Greg Sestero about the making of the legendary bad cult-classic the Room, is a movie so well-done funny and brillant, where James Franco delivers one of the best performance for years to come in comedy ! Follow-up a great Oscar caliber movie about the making of the worst movie ever made ! Acting: 10/10: James Franco is amazing brillant he delivers that performance that make me quote myslef how can he be that good, he imitates Tommy Wiseau so damn well, with the voice the style the weirdest in it, it like if Franco waited his whole life to play this role! The rest of the cast are great too, simply kind of forgettable because of Franco's performance!Directions: 8/10: It felt slow sometimes ..... yet it was done really well, you just have to see the Room too get that this movie was done perfectly! Franco, Seth really are pretty much the only one that can always come up with an hillarious movie in the past years! What a duo !Humor: 10/10: Hilarious one of the movie I have laughed the most at ! Every humor comes with James performances is take on Wiseau is insane ! Can't say much I just loved the humor and rarely laughed that much !Enjoyment: 10/10: Hands down the best way to start 2018 for me was to watch The Disaster Artist not sure someone will beat this movie off my list this year ! It one hell of a comedy and it an honour for us Room fans to see this beautiful movie ! (yess 2018 since here in MontrÃ©al it was limited and had to go really far to see it !)",10,0,3,14 January 2018
12 Strong," Great final battle but the rest mehhhh!
","With A-Stars leading and B-Stars supporting 12 Strong looked like the movie of January sadly it ain't, had hopes from the great trailer but got let down by the movie itself, felt like those SUPER AMERICAN war movies but with no fighting at all. The whole 2hours is way too long with nothing actually really happening.... At least the 10 last minutes kind of saved the film, the big fight at the end was what we wanted from the movie, what we saw in the trailer but sadly this is the only great scenes we had. Was a great concept but let down because of how boring it was, too long not what the audience wanted and waste of great actors, the movie had potential but delivered it only in it last 10min, and you don't review a film for 10mins of it. So basically the cast are great but don't have that much screentime, only Hemsworth (Thor) has screentime and all he does of it is great yet what he asked to do in the movie is bad, his character is bad and doesn't do much interesting things just thinks and talks that's it! Don't go watch that movie if you're hoping for a big war movie it ain't it feels more like a documentary which isn't bad but wasn't what I wanted to see. So for me it's a 5/10 which is a fair note in my point of view!",5,1,8,23 January 2018
Annihilation," Best Visuals since Blade Runner 2049!
","The brand new revolutionary sci-fi based on a bestseller of the same name, is a visually masterpiece ! Starring Natalie Portman and Oscar Issacs, with both incredible performances. The movie itself is pretty wierd and during the last 20 mins it does not fell like you're watching the same movie. Wait don't try to be smart and say that it all makes sense cause yes it does, but the we, it's directed did not make much sense they just putted a scene that was incredible but was so not like the rest of the movie and for that I must warn that it was not the best idea possible even tho I loved it. The last scene even tho of the whole production, but that aside and you get one of the greatest sci-fi scene ever made. The visuals in the whole movie are so good, the colours the theme's all were amazing because of their insane visuals. Annihilation is one great candidate for the 2019 Oscars even with it's early realese date.Annihilation is definelty the best you will get this February, visually insane and a great weird story, with lots of thrills and unanswered questions. Easily slides in my favorite sci-fi's ever !",8,1,2,23 March 2018
