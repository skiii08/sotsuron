Black Swan," cinematography
","Another good movie ruined by cinematography.I don't know why so many shows and movies have such shaky camera shots. This movie was up close and personal. To the point where if the camera wasn't swinging around, you could count the nose hairs on people.I tried watching this movie twice, once on my 60' and even tried on a 28' screen. Thinking a smaller screen would compensate for the roller coaster visual.Very disappointed and still slightly dizzy.Never realized what poor skin Portman had until I got to see her in closeup thru an entire movie.I still give the story and actors a 6, but would never recommend it.",6,1,3,1 May 2011
