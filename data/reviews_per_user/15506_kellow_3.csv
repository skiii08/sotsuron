Deja Vu," Potential classic ruined
","Major, major spoiler alert, because I'mm going to be talking about the ending. Deja Vu has all the makings of a classic, a sort of Memento meets Back to the Future, with twists as iconic and unexpected as the 6th Sense, Shutter Island or The Crying Game. But it all went wrong.I can suspend my belief enough to cope with the sheer implausibility of the science. Of course it's ridiculous - but this is sci-fi, although just why this amazing technology only works in central New Orleans is somewhat beyond me, presumably only as a pretext for the daft car chase scene, in which our hero manages to kill about as many people as died in the terrorist attack he is so intent on solving! And the way the pieces started fitting together was excellent. As Denzel explores the world of 3 days before, there are plenty of 'ah, now I understand' moments as we discover why his partner's car was on the boat, why his fingerprints are in the girl's flat, etc. The message is clear - no matter what Denzel does, he can't change the past, for his 'past' actions have already happened.The tension is knowing that no matter what Denzel does, the girl is going to die and the terrorist attack is going to happen. But then, for the sake of a Hollywood feel-good ending, Denzel does manage to change the past. But for the real cinema fan, the happy ending is really a disappointing one. Yeah, it's lovely to see the happy couple drive off together at the end, but that happiness is destroyed by the fact that in order for it to achieved, the whole film no longer makes the slightest bit of sense. A potential cinematographic masterpiece is suddenly no more than Hollywood trite.",4,0,2,30 December 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit that Tolkein probably wished he'd written
","The Hobbit is being slated in many reviews for being excessively long and convoluted, due to Jackson's over-indulgence and the addition of too many subplots that turn a simple children's story into a fantasy epic along the lines of Tolkein's other great masterpiece.Jackson should be commended, not criticised. Rather than produce a family-sized Christmas package for the popcorn munching crowd, he has done full justice to Tolkein's work. There will probably never be another movie version of The Hobbit in our lifetimes, and if a job's worth doing, then to hell with Hollywood tradition, and do the job well! The true Tolkein fan is in for a treat, because rather than rush the story to suit filmic convention, Jackson shows every detail. This creates pacing issues for the casual film-goer, but is an absolute delight for those of who have waited most of our lives to finally see a live-action version of one of the most popular books ever written.Tolkein himself had many issues with The Hobbit. It was only later that he started creating the true complexities of Middle Earth, and even made an aborted attempt to rewrite the book in the true context of his imagined world – in which we know the true significance of Gollum, the ring, the Necromancer, the backstory of the dwarfs and elves and so much more. In many ways, Jackson's Hobbit is the one Tolkein himself wished he had written, a much darker and more complex visitation without the talking animals or the Enid Blyton-esque feel to the elves and goblins.Every scene and piece of major dialogue from the book are included, the issue for Tolkein traditionalists will be the additions. 'Less is more' is not an expression in Jackson's vocabulary, the stone giants and chase in Goblin Town were so over-the-top that they drown out more subtle moments and serve to remove much of the dramatic tension. As our heroes escape unscathed time and again from the most ridiculous of perils, these situations start becoming more comical than foreboding.The ending was the only departure from the book that perhaps spoiled it. As in LOTR, we have Jackson's gimmick of trying to make us believe that a major character has died, followed by an uncharacteristic bit of swashbuckling heroism from Bilbo that leads to his redemption with Thorin – which book readers know should really happen under far more emotional circumstances much later in the story.",10,9,20,18 December 2012
2012," Who cares about Cusack and his silly family?
","When they made this movie, they were forgetting a fairly major point. If some distant planet is in danger of exploding, we might just identify with the few humans that happen to be there while it's happening. But this is not a distant planet. This is Earth in just a few months time from now.The special effects in this movie are enough to make the viewer at least consider how awful it would be if this were really to happen. We see the planet fall apart before our eyes, and the realism is strikingly brilliant. The problem is, any concern we feel is for our own countries, our own people, our own families and loved ones. In my case, that's mainly western Europeans and South Americans. I feel for them as I see their homelands washed away under a sea of lava.But that is not what this movie wants. It doesn't want me to feel concern for the annihilation of everything I have come to know and love. It wants me to care about Cusack and his nauseating family. I have very rarely seen a film in which I have desperately wanted the hero to die, but in this one I did. I want to know where I am, where my mother is, where my dog is, where my friends are... Cusack's silly little plastic Hollywood family is the least of my concerns right now as the world is about to end... I suppose we are meant to 'identify' with the lead family and imagine it was our own. But we don't. I would never want to wish my own family dead. Only Cusack's.",4,1,2,30 December 2011
