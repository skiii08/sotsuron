The Expendables 2," The Expendables 2 Review
","The first one was about the hype and it worked well for the intended purpose. As you may know the hype doesn't usually last that long and so we're back to the real analysis of how a feature film should be made. Here it goes.All the characters are not well developed they merely serve a certain purpose the rest of their lives is empty and lonely. I'm not watching Stallone or Li I'm watching the characters and what story they have to tell. You don't get that here at all- disappointing. They went on the hype and produced a very ambitious film, and it's overwhelming the number of superstars jam packed in it. I got the assembled part, but I don't get the plot it's very flat and straight forward. The only team member with a real story gets killed, off course you'll feel for him it's the oldest trick scriptwriters use to toy with the audience's emotions.There are too many coincidences things just happen before you know it's over. The trilogy shall not work if they repeat themselves. I enjoyed it and that's how my analysis went.",4,7,16,21 August 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln Review
","What a year of incredibly bad films what's going on here? Come on not you too Stevie losing your touch? A former statesman used to be a blood sucker hunter really? I mean really? Lincoln is about giving a baseless story a fictitious base to stand on good, not so good because it doesn't work it's a lie nobody shall ever buy into. Please don't ever try this again. It got to the point where Lincoln was frustrated with himself stuck between president and hero who shall save me he wondered? Presidents have never played heros because in reality they're all so bad.Lesson to Hollywood heayweights next time somebody walks in to pitch a script ask if they think it makes any damn sense to them or to the drunk man on the street. If the answer is a resounding yes, go ahead and fund them because that man knows for sure he won't be watching that crap.",3,2,5,14 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spiderman Review
","I've always wanted to see a Spiderman film without sinking too much into the plot.Enjoyable merely as a superhero fan. Spiderman plays on the strengths of its predecessors and does a tough job covering up the weaknesses. It's clear to see that Marvel stretched its fingernails in saving their precious spider. Four films later you don't expect anyone to still ask Spiderman who he is, unless that person comes from another planet they don't belong in the story.The amount of flying and experimenting that Peter does makes it seem as if this is the first ever Spiderman film. It's a weak point the film doesn't address; why does the story go back in time without moving forward at all? Will this be the case with all future releases or is this the last one? I like continuation in franchises and I didn't get it here, not enough to make me regret missing previous releases.",5,7,15,18 July 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Twilight Saga Part 2 review
",Twilight has been about creating a hype from the book to the films and congratulations to Summit for achieving the set objective. I was impressed by the picture quality in comparison with other vampire films which are usually dark and dreary. This one has a few good points and a lot of no-so-good points.One; after all this years Robert didn't bite Bella aided by suppressing his 'desires'. Two; these vampires are day-walkers for no apparent reason. Three; they look rather pale for vampires who get so much sunlight while socializing with the locals. Four; Bella's father's wannabe dumb act is hopeless. Wow! your adopted daughter has grown super quick in the last twelve months what're you feeding her? Five; that big promised fight between 'good vampires' and 'bad vampires' turns out to be a maybe it could happen. Six; the flashback in the end tells is more compelling than the whole film.,2,15,40,19 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman Review
","Batman was always my favorite childhood superhero, but when you've grown a little it's not the same anymore. The cape and mask are ugly and how does Wayne's voice suddenly change when he's the bat beats me? They should do something real to Batman's costume, maybe his voice sounds different because the mask suffocates the poor guy.Speaking of masks why on Earth does Bane wear a mask? For people to take him seriously he claims. All he had to do was frighten some stockbrokers and free them within seconds, the act of a dumb villain no doubt.You won't make up a single word Bane says- irritating.You can't help, but miss the bad o' villains from previous releases given the lack of enthusiasm displayed by Bane and company.False characters are plenty here for example, a cop amazingly makes detective simply because he knows Batman's identity wow! what would we do without him? 3000 cops are effortlessly lured into a tunnel. Bane's incredible strength is unknown his sister claims that it's because he can suppress pain and agony, you learn something new everyday. I can on and on but I'd spoil it for you.",4,3,9,7 August 2012
