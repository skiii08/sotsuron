The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Pathetic piece of garbage
","I know I know, this is one of the movies some people love and others hate. When the first Twilight came out the series was off to an interesting start. Some things seemed off (make up / acting) but it still had a very commercial and fresh approach of an old school topic. Unfortunately the following movies were much weaker (in my opinion) than the fairly good starter.But now this Breaking dawn comes along:The acting, the script, the cinematography, effects, score and general feel of the newest addition to the Twilight family blows everything seen before out of proportion. I sat in the movie theater BEGGING it to get better. Basically it's 90 minutes waiting for something that is so pathetically done that you wish you were waiting for Nachos instead... A huge waste of time and an insult to every filmmaker that isn't able to get his project financed... I seriously couldn't believe how badly done it was.",2,13,17,3 December 2011
Cloud Atlas," If you are a movie lover, do yourself a favor and watch this piece of art!
","Let me start of by saying that - even though I've seen a LOT of movies - I've never encountered anything like this. And that's a very good thing! Cloud Atlas is everything a movie should be and so much more. I won't go into the story because I find it too deep to simply describe, you just have to see it for yourself. But as the summary says - if you are a movie lover, do yourself a favor and watch this piece of art!The Wachowski brothers (best known for their Matrix universe (which I agree, only the first was really revolutionary)) and Tom Twyker (The Perfume) team up to redefine 'epic'.From the amazing storyline (which is not your typical predictable risk- less mainstream) to the state of the art cinematography, the mindblowing special FX and the incredible future vision, this film just sucked me in from the first moment, not even understanding why it's so enchanting, and kept me laughing and crying through out the whole time. It's long, but you won't notice because it is SO good, time flies by. Again, don't let this movie flop, go watch in in the theater where it's meant to be seen. You won't regret it if you see it with an open mind!",10,7,14,31 October 2012
