Insidious: Chapter 2," Not A Classic By Any Means, But Still Enjoyable
","The Lambert family have moved on from their previous events and are now safe. Or are they? When Renai (Rose Byrne) starts witnessing strange happenings once again, and with Josh (Patrick Wilson) acting more & more strangely each day, she reaches for the help of Specs & Tucker once again - two of Elise's assistants - to try and get rid of the malevolent spirit that has been haunting her family.Insidious: Chapter 2 is a pretty decent sequel to the fantastic Insidious. Like the first movie, it start's off pretty slow (a seemingly regular theme with James Wan movies), but picks up steadily from about the 45 minute mark and does get better.While there's a decent amount of tension in the movie I didn't feel as creeped out with this film as I did the first. The first movie also relied - and succeeded - more on visuals and scene setting to make you feel very uneasy to scare you rather than using just the 'jump/scare' tactics. This time around, I feel that it's slightly more the other way around, but in saying that it does have it's moments of making you feel slightly uneasy. Just not as good as the first movie.Insidious: Chapter 2 does actually start to get a wee bit confusing with the amount of cross-over's between the real world and the spirit world as well so you do have to pay close attention to what is going on. If you don't then you'll easily get lost as to what's happening. With that said, however, a good few of these scenes actually tie in with certain events and happenings from the first film i.e. a bang on the house's front door in the first film, you see in this film what caused it. This was actually a really good touch to combine events from the first movie into this one and the tie-in's are done pretty well.Like I say, it's a decent sequel and while it isn't as good as the first one it's still a good movie to watch.",6,0,0,16 January 2015
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not As Exciting As The 2nd Installment, But Still Decent
","So, here we have the 3rd installment in the film series of The Hunger Games and unfortunately it's not as good as the 2nd film, Catching Fire. For me, Mockingjay - Part 1 takes a step backwards as it's not as exciting, fast-paced, or absorbing as the previous film. It is, however, still better than the 1st movie.Before I started watching The Hunger Games film series, I was of the opinion that they were just another bunch of massively over-hyped SciFi/Action films aimed at the teeny crowd. I only ended up watching the 1st film because it was on TV. I still stand by my original thoughts about that 1st installment because it really wasn't anything that great and was a very average outing. Where it changed for me was the 2nd movie. That one was MUCH better than it's predecessor, and I actually enjoyed it, even with the 1st 40 minutes or so being slower than a snail in treacle. Mockingjay - Part 1, though, while still decent and better than the 1st movie, was still a bit of a disappointment.This time around, the story is more focused on the emotion and getting Katniss Everdeen to become a sort of rebel leader/saviour for the people of each District and to start a rebellion against President Snow. I'm not complaining about where the story's focus is as I know the series can't be JUST the games all the time. It's the execution of the story that lets me down a bit as it was just a bit too bland and slow. Even Jennifer Lawrence's performance was pretty bland also. She didn't seem to have the same conviction with her character as she did in the previous films.That aside, there were still some good moments of tension and the action that is in the film is good. In fact, it's this tension and action that keeps the film going for me. Another thing I liked? No Alice in Wonderland style costumes!! That was one thing I hated about the previous films, and thankfully none of that is here.Anyway, onto Mockingjay - Part 2 and hopefully that won't fail to deliver.",6,2,4,30 July 2015
Captain Phillips," Absolute First Class Action Drama
","I'll admit that when I first saw trailers for this movie I wasn't too impressed. It just looked like an average run-of-the-mill 'based on true events' drama. I'm glad I changed my mind, though, as Captain Phillips is one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time.Firstly, the casting was absolutely spot on and for his first acting event, Barkhad Abdi is absolutely fantastic and is well deserving of all nominations and awards he has received for his role as Muse, the lead Somali pirate. The other three actors - Barkhad Abdirahman as Bilal, Faysal Ahmed as Najee, and Mahat M. Ali as Elmi - all do a stand-up job also. As for Tom Hanks, well, what more can be said really? He delivers once again.You might think that at almost 2¼ hours long it's pretty drawn out, but nothing could be further from the truth. It doesn't take long to get going and the suspense just continues to build from there on in.I've actually read reviews about how 'unbelievable' it is that only 4 pirates manage to board & take over such a large cargo ship. I guess these people never knew that this film is actually based on true events and it wasn't just a matter of Hollywood hamming up another storyline. Even if it was a Hollywood thing....the Pirates had semi-automatic rifles and handguns so compare that to the cargo ship's water cannons and NO guns and it would have been relatively simple for these pirates to have boarded such a big vessel.When watching the film, you kind of feel a certain amount of sympathy for Muse because of where he comes from and his background. I know that that doesn't condone his actions of pirating, but he does actually draw a certain amount of sympathy. Then again, if he was a hothead like Bilal it might have had a different feel to it and been a different story.Captain Phillips is one of those classic must-see movies and is actually deserving of the 'must-see' tag. Absolutely fantastic film that deserves every plaudit received.",8,0,2,16 January 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," A Very Decent Cloverfield Spin-Off
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense thriller carried by great performances from John Goodman & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. This isn't really a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield though; more like a spin-off, with a different story taking place in a different part of the world. While Cloverfield jumped onto a current trend at that time ('found footage'), this film feels more old-fashioned in style.Dan Trachtenberg's film is less visually engaging than it could have been, but this is solid entertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing before it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending. The sense of uneasiness you get at times is certainly there in the script, but it's Goodman's performance that makes your skin crawl. He captures a man on the edge of sanity for whom control is key. He's not an obvious maniac, but someone who honestly thinks he's a savior. Goodman keeps us guessing, allowing glimpses of the possibly kind man that Howard used to be.In terms of performance, Winstead matches Goodman in every way. She helps carry carry 10 Cloverfield Lane, conveying Michelle's conflicted feelings about her predicament and staying completely in the moment that the tension remains.The final 30 minutes of the movie is pretty much going to dominate conversation. Without spoiling anything, it's a series of events in which Michelle finds new challenges around every corner, and while I'm not sure it's as solid as it could have been, Winstead and the filmmakers keep it working through sheer confidence.The visuals this time around aren't as overwhelming as they are in Cloverfield, but that can just reiterate the point that a film doesn't need to be laden with special effects to be any good. Investing in decent performances & story can be more key to making a film enjoyable than relying on amazing visuals.10 Cloverfield lane is definitely worth a watch and it's nice to take a break from the usual 'found footage' Horror/Thrillers that seem to dominate at times.",6,0,0,7 February 2018
The Equalizer," An Excellent Watch. Do NOT Miss This.
","I've got to admit that I had my doubts about this film even after seeing the trailer for it. Not because it looked like just another over-the-top actioner, but because it didn't really strike me as a film worth watching. Boy, was I ever wrong, and I'm SO glad I decided to watch it after thinking 'Ah, what the Hell...I'll give it a try'.The Equalizer is actually one of the best recent action films that I've seen for a good while and everything - from the direction and cinematography to the casting and action & suspense - is just so well done. It's very refreshing to watch an action film that has a credible & enthralling story to it as well instead of some simple, IQ draining, cliché filled tripe like The Fast & The Furious.There are a lot of good scenes throughout this film and I think I would be hard pushed to pick out just one that was better than any other. In saying that, though, the slow-motion scenes were definitely some of the stand-out moments for me and were filmed perfectly, capturing the calculating mind of McCall nicely.The cast was spot-on as well with Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, and Chloë Grace Moretz all doing bang-up jobs with their characters. Washington's portrayal of McCall was just nailed to perfection as was Csokas's performance as the vicious, calculating Russian mafia henchman Nikolai 'Teddy' Itchenko.I think the only reason that stopped me from giving this film a higher rating was due to it being a wee bit slow in some places. I know that to be a GOOD action film, you need to develop the story, the characters, and the mood for what's coming, and while it succeeded in doing all of that. it just felt a touch slow during some scenes. That's a very minor point, however, and it in no way spoils any of the viewing.If you haven't seen this film then you're definitely missing out on an absolute gem. Great cast, well written, and full of action & suspense. What more could you want?",8,0,3,30 May 2015
Resident Evil: Afterlife," One Of The Weaker Installments Of The Series
","In this 4th installment, Alice continues her fight against the Umbrella Corporation. She now finds herself in Alaska in hope of finding some kind of humanity left from the disaster of the T-Virus. After finding Claire Redfield (a survivor she was with in Nevada), they make their way to L.A. where they find another small band of survivors who've taken refuge in a maximum security prison. Working together, they try to find refuge in Arcadia. However, all is not as it seems regarding Arcadia, and with the zombies continuing to surround the prison, it soon becomes a race against time to get to safety.OK, the first three movies were decent....thin on story, granted (apart from really the 1st one), but they had good action & suspense. Unfortunately Resident Evil: Afterlife is messy. It starts out in Japan, where we see the start of the zombie attacks, then 4 years later where Alice and her 'friends' try to break into the Umbrella Corporation there, then 6 months later she's hundreds of miles away in Alaska, so it's pretty confusing to follow to start with.The story is, well, to say it's thin would be an understatement. Action is the main reliant, which isn't too bad, however this is basically a Matrix movie with a Resident Evil title. The slow motion action (which were obviously done for the 3D) is pretty cool in a good few scenes, but there's just a bit too many. It's a bit like a John Woo film on crack.Also, this film copies so many other movies as well....Wesker dodging bullets (Neo from The Matrix); bullet time (Max Payne); Axeman character (Pyramid Head from Silent Hill); zombies mouths stretching open (vampires in Blade 2). So really nothing is that original.The acting by Wentworth Miller (who played Chris Redfield) and Shawn Roberts (who played Albert Wesker) was just awful as well, so add that to other mediocre scenes and you have a very lackluster installment to the series. Some very cool action scenes but that's about it for this one really.",5,2,4,15 January 2015
Deja Vu," Another Enjoyable Washington & Scott Combo
","Déjà Vu. A film directed by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington. A 99% chance right there that this film would be an enjoyable even if you had never seen any trailers for it, and it was, just like the other films the two had worked together on before, from Man On Fire to Crimson Tide. It was one of those combinations that just seemed to work every time.Unlike the previous films, however, this time Science Fiction is brought into the equation with the topics of parallel universes and time travel being major parts of the story. Right there should tell you that it's a film that needs to be paid attention to, and if you don't you'll be lost as soon as the story starts to kick in with the whole time travel aspect.Now, I've seen movies that deal with the time travel theory and they can be very hit and miss because some of them try to be too clever for their own good. They become over-complicated and you end up just losing interest. Others, though, are enjoyable and while they do get complicated, they don't over-do it.Déjà Vu is one I'd include in the latter category.The overall story is an enjoyable one, and even though there are some slower moments scattered throughout the film, at no point in time does it ever get boring. On the flip side, parts of the story move at a much faster rate, especially when the time travel aspect is being explained. Either way it always keeps you interested right from the start. It's also a pretty clever story and there are a few subtle instances that gets you thinking about various issues that arise from within the film.Like I said earlier, it's clever but it's not overdone.The cast is excellent with Washington leading the way as ATF Agent Doug Carlin and Jim Caviezel playing his opposite as 'the bad guy' Carroll Oerstadt. Very believable performances and they, along with the rest of the cast, help bring enjoyment to a very exciting Action/Sci-Fi Thriller.This is definitely a film to watch.",7,2,3,27 March 2016
Minority Report," Another Excellent Spielberg & Cruise Movie
","In the year 2054, crime has been virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. thanks to Precrime - a new elite law enforcement agency. They use three gifted humans - called Pre-Cogs - who all have the ability to see into the future to predict crimes beforehand. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who trusts the system 100%, heads Precrime and believes it to be flawlessness. That is until one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit murder himself within the next 36 hours. Suddenly Anderton's faith in the system is being tested as he doesn't believe he will commit the murder and he now has to find a way to prove his innocence before it's too late.Minority Report is another cracker of a movie from one of the masters of film making, Steven Spielberg. The story is rather complex and one that you have to pay close attention to, but it is handled really well and doesn't become messy. With movies like this, it's easy for the story to become too confusing and muddled (like Looper, for example), but that, thankfully, isn't the case with Minority Report. It has you drawn in right from the off and has plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing.The cast is spot on as well and love him or hate him, Tom Cruise nails yet another role with a great performance. One of the standout performances, though, has to be Samantha Morton who plays the part of Agatha...one of the Pre-Cogs for Precrime. She just works the part so well and brings about a real believability to someone who has been removed from her 24-hour future-seeing world to the real world.The movie has got some pretty impressive visuals as well and even now in 2014, 12 years on from when the movie was released, they still look excellent and not at all dated.Everything about this movie is impressive and if you enjoy futuristic action movies with a great cast, impressive visuals, intense action, and a totally absorbing storyline then you will enjoy Minority Report.",7,0,0,17 January 2015
The Maze Runner," A Very Enjoyable Action Sci-Fi Fantasy
","I never really paid much attention until I saw the trailers for it, but from what I saw in them, The Maze Runner lived up to all expectations and it was a really enjoyable Sci-Fi Fantasy for me. I never knew that this was based on a book either and if this lives up to the usual routine of books typically being better than their movie adaptations then it must be a cracker of a read.It may not be the most original idea for a story i.e. the human 'rats in a maze' experiment, but at least it's a film that concentrates on putting together a good plot rather than just being self-reliant on visual & special effects. Sometimes it just seems that too many movies these days rely heavily on visual & special effects to dazzle the audience while forgetting about the story (Pacific Rim, for example). Thankfully that's not the case here. Don't get me wrong...the visuals are amazing and they definitely help bring the film to life. It's just that the effects are more of a very nicely added bonus to a well written plot.With these elements combined, the film delivers a very nice amount of action, tension & suspense....the majority of which come from within the maze obviously. The maze itself is VERY imposing, and when you throw in the Grievers as well (sort of guardians of the maze), it's a place where you definitely wouldn't want to be.Another area that wasn't ignored was the choices for the individual members of the cast, who all played their parts really well, and, thankfully, it wasn't a stereotypical cast of all young buff, good looking guys who couldn't act to save themselves (such as Twilight). They were all 'normal' looking actors and they all played their parts with a decent amount of believability.The Maze Runner is not an absolute classic by any means, but it is well filmed, well acted, well told, and is definitely a very enjoyable film.",7,0,1,8 February 2015
The Fan," De Niro Is The Man
","Knife salesman Gil Renard is a die-hard baseball fan and is looking forward to Opening Day more than normal as his team, the San Fransisco Giants, have acquired Bobby Rayburn - a 3-time MVP - from the Atlanta Braves. However, not long into the season, Rayburn's form goes downhill fast, and he starts to fall out with his teammates, especially the on-form Juan Primo. Gil decides to try and 'help' Rayburn any way he can even if it means taking things a bit too far, but when he's not given the credit he thinks he deserves after Rayburn starts hitting again, Gil takes matters into his own hands after a 'chance' meeting with Rayburn.Whether you like psychological thrillers, are a fan of De Niro or Snipes, or all of the above, The Fan is definitely a must-see kind of movie. The story's not intricate nor deeply complex, but it doesn't need to be when it's told & delivered as good as this.The film's cast is excellent...De Niro, Snipes, Leguizamo, Del Toro all do a fantastic job, but the master is definitely De Niro and he's at his psychotic best once again. The way he portrays Gil going on a steady downward spiral deeper into insanity is fantastic and scarily realistic. Snipes also does a good job of playing cocky Rayburn, which isn't too far off how a lot of players see themselves.The Nine Inch Nails soundtrack of 'Closer' is used to great effect and really adds to atmosphere of Gil's descent into madness. I've seen people moaning about the lack of 'realism' regarding the game of baseball in this movie also. How many action movies have we seen where the 'hero' gets shot at 1000s of times but doesn't get hit once? Or all those James Bond moments when he's in trouble? People still enjoy them though. Yes, some of it's not realistic e.g. playing the game in a torrential downpour, but if you want 'realism' regarding baseball then go and watch a documentary about the game. This is a film for entertainment...not education, so just enjoy it for what it is.",7,3,4,19 January 2015
World War Z," Enjoyable Zombie Romp
","Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who has been recruited by the government to try and find the source of a deadly virus which has been infecting mankind, turning them into vicious zombies.The way this movie starts is excellent as it doesn't take long at all for all hell to start breaking loose. From that moment on it definitely keeps your attention. Sometimes the downside to movies starting off so well is that it set's a precedent for the rest of the movie to be as exciting, which is hard to do. Thankfully World War Z manages to keep a really good pace throughout, mixing a good amount of action and suspense, and while I understand it cannot be relentless for the entire movie duration, it does get a wee bit slow in places. Fortunately, these moments don't last too long though, and they are usually a build up to some good tense scenes.A lot of the visuals are really superb, especially when you see the big wide shots of the zombie attacks in New York, New Jersey and Israel from the ground and from above. The tension that these scenes build are excellent as well, even moreso when the zombies actually start climbing over themselves to get over the walls in Israel.Watching it all in action you can understand why the movie cost around $190m to make. Nothing is really original about the zombies in this movie in the way they act and the way they move - as 28 Days Later was the first movie to portray zombies/infected as fast, vicious killers - but they are still done really well with suspense being the main focus for them to scare people rather than a Dawn of the Dead type of zombie where it's mainly gore.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while and while overall I wasn't disappointed, it lacked a wee bit of something. Maybe it's because it's really all been done - PLENTY of times - before. Who knows, but what I do know is that World War Z is definitely a good film to watch.",7,0,1,14 January 2015
The Hunger Games," Massively Overrated
","I had absolutely no interest in seeing this movie when it came out back in 2012. I saw trailers for it and couldn't see what all the hype was about, so I never gave it a 2nd thought. After now watching it (I saw it on TV purely because there was nothing else on) I STILL can't see what the hype is all about because for me The Hunger Games is a somewhat mediocre - and vastly overrated - Sci-Fi/Action movie that left me feeling unfulfilled and kind of bored.Don't get me wrong...it's a watchable film, but it's definitely not anywhere near the hype it's been given, nor as good. Teens may enjoy it, but in all honesty, anyone over the age of 16 will probably think it's a very average movie.Now, I've not read the books (and have no intention to either) so I don't know how accurate the films are in comparison to the novels, but this is basically a cross between The Running Man and Battle Royale with the look of Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland thrown in that is aimed for the mid-teen crowd. In fact I can just picture a bunch of teen girls 'ooohhh-ing', 'aahhhhh-ing', and giggling every time Liam Hemsworth comes on screen, or teen boys wiping drool off their chins as they gawp at Jennifer Lawrence. Makes me glad I don't have kids myself so I'm not forced to watch movies like this.It's usually these reasons why I avoid these types of films...it's all about looks rather than acting ability or story. That and they are generally guff.Anyway, if you're looking for something that is exciting, thrilling, keeps you entertained with an enjoyable story then you'd best avoid this. On the other hand, if you're wanting to watch something because there's nothing else on, or just want to while away a couple of hours then you can do worse than The Hunger Games.",5,1,2,15 June 2015
The Babadook," A Decent Psychological Horror
","I don't think The Babadook is anywhere near as good as some people are making it out to be, but it's definitely not a bad film either. It's also a more subtle horror than what we're used to seeing these days, and isn't one of those typical jump/scare/slasher films, so if you're expecting that you may be disappointed here.Like I said, the horror is subtle...it's not in your face, it's not gory, it doesn't race at you, and, again, this will not be to everyone's taste.The film's pretty slow paced for the most part, but if you can get into the story then it won't seem that slow because it draws you in and keeps your interest. It also unfolds nicely as it goes along, and it's not a film that has step-by-step instructions on what is going on which could be another reason why some people don't like it. There's obviously nothing wrong with that, but for me personally it's just refreshing see a film come along that breaks for the norm of having everything laid out in front of me.The Babadook isn't one dimensional with it's horror either, as it's not just about a mother & son who are haunted by a 'boogeyman' (who's actually creepy in the scenes it's shown and heard in). The horror comes in different forms...the son trying to cope without a dad, struggling with being bullied, and who's convinced a monster's in the house; the mother struggling to cope with being a single parent, and suffering from depression. They are struggling with their own demons so to speak, so the horror comes from different angles.The acting is pretty good for the most part, and Noah Wiseman, who plays Sam, does a great job of making you feel sorry for him one minute to wanting to slap him because of his behaviour the next. His inventions are pretty cool as well.Overall, while there are better psychological horrors out there than The Babadook, it doesn't mean that it's a bad film. It's well directed, well written, and well played out. Definitely worth a watch.",5,1,5,22 April 2015
Rise of the Guardians," Another Enjoyable DreamWorks Animation
","The Sandman, The Tooth Fairy, The Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and Jack Frost. All must join forces to stop the dreaded Boogie Man from taking over children's dreams and causing them endless nightmares.Now, as with a lot of DreamWorks animated movies, the animation in Rise Of The Guardians is absolutely superb and is really amazing to see, especially on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the movie itself isn't as good as the animation, BUT in saying that it's still a very decent, enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch. Also, while it's not your typical 'roll about the ground laughing' kind of animation there are still some good funny moments, of which a good few involve Santa's elves.I have to say as well that the way the movie makers have portrayed each of The Guardians was pretty impressive, from the big, tattooed, imposing figure of Santa Claus and the wise-cracking Aussie Easter Bunny, to the dark, scary & mean Boogie Man. There isn't a single character in the movie that you will feel any annoyance or dislike towards (well, apart from the obvious one of The Boogie Man). Even the big Abominable Snowmen that help Santa Claus are likable and somewhat funny.Speaking of the Boogie Man, there are some scenes that may possibly scare a younger audience (ages of about 5 or 6), but in all honesty there's nothing too bad here that will give them nightmares, and they will more than likely enjoy the movie regardless of any scares they may get from watching the Boogie Man.All in all, while it's not DreamWorks best feature, Rise Of The Guardians is, as I said earlier, still a very enjoyable movie to watch.",6,1,2,24 September 2014
Resident Evil: Extinction," Alice's Fight Continues In This Decent Sequel
","In this 3rd installment of the Resident Evil series, we find that the T-Virus has spread out from Raccoon City at an alarming rate and has infected practically the whole of mankind. Alice continues her fight against the Umbrella Corporation and has now reached the baron deserts of Nevada where she joins up with a small band of survivors. Acting on information that the T-Virus hasn't reached Alaska, they all decide to take a chance and make the distant journey. However, Alice still has the Umbrella Corporation in her sights, so she now has to make a decision on whether to stay with her new friends, or continue her fight against Umbrella.I think it's pretty safe to say the film adaptations of the Resident Evil games have taken on a whole new self perspective as they don't really have anything to do with the game series now. Yes there's the Umbrella Corporation, the T-Virus, the zombies, but that's about it really. That's not a complaint, though - just a mere observation, because this is still a decent film and if you go into it just to watch it for what it's supposed to be, then you shouldn't really be too disappointed.Like the 2nd film, the story obviously isn't the main ingredient and it's the action that keeps it going, but in saying that I did feel that there was more of a developing story than what was in Apocalypse, but not by much. But let's be real here - we don't watch this type of movie for the riveting plot & gripping story lines...we watch them for the action and like I say, the action & visuals that are in the film is good enough to keep you entertained.Another thing I like about this movie is that it does continue the story (even if it is thin). It's not a sequel that has absolutely no bearing on the previous movie(s) and just uses the film name. You can watch it as a stand-alone film, but you'll not really have much idea what's going on so it's best watching the previous movies 1st.Definitely worth a watch.",6,0,0,15 January 2015
Zodiac," Nothing Fantastic But Still A Very Enjoyable Thriller
","Zodiac ticks all the boxes for a very good mystery crime thriller...a great cast, nicely filmed, and well written. Unfortunately, the 'decent pace' box cannot be checked as I found the film to be just a bit too slow, and I actually found myself struggling not to nod off about halfway through. Thankfully, the film maintained enough interest later on to alleviate all desire to fall asleep completely.The film start's off decently enough with a nice, steady developing story with an adequate pace that we're accustomed to seeing in a thriller of this type, but after about an hour or so, nothing much picks up and it felt as if it just trudged on for a good while until picking up again within the last 45 minutes.I must say that one thing that did impress me about the movie was the attention to detail Fincher put into trying to recreate an accurate telling of the Zodiac case. I mean yes there were fictionalised parts (the Graysmith/Avery friendship for one), but any director who spends 18 months researching the case, interviewing countless people including witnesses, family members, former detectives, and even suspects, and goes to the trouble of having trees flown in to make a particular landmark look the way it did 40 years prior deserves recognition for attempted accuracy. Films like this, Se7en, The Game, and Panic Room proved he was capable of being much more than just a music video director.The film's cast is fantastic with Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Edwards, and Downey Jr. all giving great performances, especially Downey Jr., who I'm not a fan of but was excellent here, and Gyllenhaal who continues to get better and better with the different roles he plays (check out Nighcrawler & Southpaw for more evidence of this).In saying all of that, is Zodiac a great film? No, but it IS a very good film and it's definitely worth a watch if you enjoy films of this type.",6,0,0,10 July 2015
Silent Hill," One Of The Better Game-To-Film Adaptations
","Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) is a mother who is attempting to find out why her adopted daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), is continuously having dreams about the small ghost town of Silent Hill. Rose decides to go to Silent Hill in an attempt to find answers, but unfortunately finds herself caught up in a living hell.Silent Hill is one of the much better attempts of the game-to-film adaptations. One of the best aspects of the film is the atmosphere which is nothing short of excellent, especially when 'the darkness' starts to fall and the warning that sounds out when this is about to happen. It brings about a terrific feel of claustrophobia during these scenes which just adds to the feel of the movie.The photography is really good as well and brings a really creepy ghostly feel to the town of Silent Hill and the labyrinth of corridors below. The 'monsters' are also impressive, especially the main one of Pyramid Head. Unfortunately he isn't in the movie for that long which is a shame because this character is so imposing and freaky that it would have been good to have had him in the film for longer periods. But what there is of him is good, though.One of the main downsides to the movie was the casting of Sean Bean as Christopher Da Silva. Not because he himself was poor but because his American accent was. This is one of those annoying things that movie makers do and is a pet peeve of mine. Instead of getting an American to play the part, they get an actor who is from Yorkshire which is one of the strongest English accents you can get. Anyway, I generally don't mind Sean Bean, but his accent was just a bit off-putting and his own accent still comes through a bit too much. He isn't in the movie for too long at any one period so fortunately it doesn't ruin the feel of the movie too much.All in all, Silent Hill is a very decent movie to watch. Sit back with the sound up and with the lights off for a much better feel. Definitely recommended.",7,0,0,14 January 2015
Shutter Island," A Classic From Martin Scorsese
","U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital on Shutter Island (a place he's been pushing to investigate due to personal reasons). Before long, however, Daniels starts to doubt the reasons why he was given the assignment as he starts to piece together a seemingly twisted plot by hospital doctors, headed by Dr. Cawley. Daniels' investigation soon brings about a promising lead, but Cawley refuses access to records he suspects would break the case open. Daniels soon starts to have vivid hallucinations & dreams which start to question his sanity and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, and soon he begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.If only all psychological thrillers were as good as Shutter Island we'd be in for a treat. This is an all-round great film...well written, great cast, excellent suspense with fantastic atmosphere. It's a very dark & moody film with a really good story that slowly unfolds nicely as it goes along.The setting of a mental institution is perfect for a movie of this style as well (and is a favourite of mine) because when done right, you will be hard pushed to find a more darker, creepier setting. It IS a complicated story, however, and you do need to pay attention right from the off with no distractions i.e. no kids making noise or wife continuously asking questions.The movie may take a couple of watches to see things that you possibly missed, and honestly if you do miss anything, make sure you re-watch them because when you understand what is going on, it will make it that much better, believe me. The ending is the clincher, though, and it's here that the whole movie comes together perfectly.Shutter Island is definitely one of those 'must see' films, and if you've not seen it then shame on you because you're missing a real gem.",8,0,3,19 January 2015
Pacific Rim," Eye Candy But Lacks A Decent Story
","When two tectonic plates shift beneath the ocean, they create a tear in the earths crust creating a portal between two dimensions. Monstrous creatures known as Kaiju start coming through the fissure and attacking mankind. Realising that current weaponry isn't effective in bringing a Kaiju down quickly enough, humans work together to come up with new technology to defeat the creatures. This technology comes in the shape of Jaegers...giant robot-like war machines. When the attacks start happening more frequently, a plan to close the tear is devised but this brings about it's own obvious risks. However, it's either that, or the world will be destroyed.Pacific Rim is an absolute feast for the eyes as it's a truly amazing film for special/visual effects. As a feast for the brain, however....not so much, because when you take away the superb visuals and fight scenes you have a pretty lame film.Now, I know films like this generally don't have Oscar winning story lines, but sometimes there's something there to keep you interested other than the amazing effects. Not here though, and this is a classic example of movie makers relying more on gorgeous effects than story to win audiences over.The acting - especially by Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket - is nothing to write home about either and is very cringeworthy at times. It's not just limited to him, though, as a good few of the other main stars' acting is pretty dire.Also, as I watched the movie, I saw a good few storyline similarities to Independence Day. I can't say anything without spoiling the movie, and you may well think 'how the hell do you figure that out?', but after watching it you'll see the similarities between the two. I'm not saying Pacific Rim's a rip-off, but originality goes out the window in this movie too, so to couple that with bad acting and a lame story, you have a very mediocre popcorn action/sci-fi flick...even with all the amazing visuals.Not bad, but definitely not that good either.",4,2,3,16 January 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," Fantastic Third Installment
","An excellent third installment to the Bourne trilogy and just like The Bourne Supremacy, this third film comes at you just as quick (if not quicker) in both storyline and action.Damon is once again perfect as Jason Bourne, delivering a very believable performance as a former secret undercover agent. In this installment it all comes to a head as Bourne remembers more about who he is and how he came to be working for an undercover agency as an assassin. Realising that he is still being pursued, Bourne sets out to put a stop to the program that 'created' him and to bring an end to the people who created the program.Just as a quick mention - don't expect to watch this movie and get what is going on if you haven't watched the first two movies beforehand. The whole series is much better when watched right from the start.Great movie and I recommend giving it a watch.",8,0,0,21 September 2014
Nightcrawler," Utterly Compelling
","Dark, thrilling, gritty, exciting, absorbing. These are just a few adjectives that describe Nightcrawler. It's also superbly written, directed, and acted with Jake Gyllenhaal giving an outstanding performance as Louis Bloom, a sociopathic loner who discovers the world of freelance journalism. It's also a fantastic directorial debut from Dan Gilroy, and thankfully a much better writing piece than his last outing, The Bourne Legacy. Everything you could hope for from a movie of this genre, Nightcrawler delivers and it delivers it excellently.We all know that this is obviously a fictional story but really what the film shows us isn't too far from the truth with regards to the paparazzi and news networks. For instance, the extremes Bloom goes to - for the most part at least - in trying to get his exclusive scoops, and the networks all desperate for their ratings, can be likened to those who do the same in the real world. The point could be argued that the film takes it a bit far just to add excitement & suspense, but when you read about what happened to Princess Diana and the way the networks completely distorted the truth regarding the Zimmerman trial, the film doesn't take it too far at all.As for the cast, well, Gyllenhaal completely dominates with his performance as Louis Bloom, and how he wasn't even nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars is beyond me. He plays Bloom in such a way that you don't know whether to like him, feel sorry for him, or be completely creeped out by him. For me, it's a combination of all three to start, but as Bloom becomes more obsessed & more relentless the creep factor starts to come out much more. Special mentions go to Bill Paxton & Renee Russo for their roles as Joe Loder - a weasel of a freelancer and Bloom's main rival - and Nina Romina - the network's morning news director who's desperate for not only those exclusives, but to stay in her job.This is definitely a movie that should be put into the 'must see' category.",8,1,2,5 April 2015
Oblivion," Cruise Delivers Again
","The year's 2077. Earth has become a desolate & remote planet after an attack - and subsequent destruction - on the moon by alien beings called Scavengers. The human race now inhabit Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, but Jack Harper (Cruise), who's a clone & security technician, has been assigned to stay on earth along with girlfriend Victoria (Riseborough), who's a communications officer, and keep the Scavs from trying to destroy important buildings known as hydros. However, after rescuing a single survivor from a crash site then reluctantly coming into contact with the Scavs, he discovers that everything's not as it seems on earth.Put bluntly Oblivion is an absolute epic feast for the eyes. Everything's shot on such a massive scale with the special & visual effects being nothing short of stunning right the way through. After watching, you can definitely see why the film cost an estimated $120m to produce.Story-wise, it's nothing really original or special, but that doesn't make it bad, and it's well played out at a good steady pace. There aren't really any boring parts either, and it definitely keeps your attention. Pay close attention though, because if you don't you can become lost pretty easily (as I found out with my wife about a third of the way through after I heard a muttered 'I'm lost').Like him or loathe him, Tom Cruise delivers once again. He may seem a bit out there at times off-screen, but on-screen he brings it home and plays the part of Harper so well. Riseborough is a touch annoying with her 'butter wouldn't melt' English accent and persona, but thankfully it's not enough to ruin the movie. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman. Absolute brilliance no matter what he's in or how long he's in it for.Overall, if you love sci-fi movies which are set on a massive scale such as this, or even just sci-fi movies in general, then you will be drooling over this one. Even if sci-fi isn't your main thing, Oblivion is most definitely worth watching.",7,0,0,14 January 2015
The Bourne Identity," Great Action/Thriller Flick
","The Bourne Identity is an excellent Action/Thriller that keeps you watching even when it slows down in pace. It is similar to Bond movies but with one major difference - it's got a very good plot & story to it.Matt Damon is perfect in the role of Jason Bourne, and Franka Potente as Marie - his somewhat unfortunate 'partner in crime' - is good without ever becoming annoying. This is definitely a movie you need to pay attention to, because in parts the story moves along almost as fast as the action and if you don't keep up then it can be easy to get lost on what's happening. That is in no way a bad thing, though, as it gives you that 'want to see what happens next' feeling. The movie does slow down in some parts, but even when that happens the movie's plot-line still ticks along nicely without it ever getting boring.A movie very much recommended.",7,0,1,21 September 2014
Man of Steel," Ignore The Hate. This Is A Fantastic Movie
","We all know the story of Superman so I'm not going to waste any time really mentioning this. I've read quite a few bad reviews about Man Of Steel with people moaning about it not sticking to previous versions and that it's just 'CGI porn' (yet a lot of these same CGI moaners rate The Avengers, Batman, and Thor. Go figure).Superman Returns went the way of previous versions yet look how that fared. People even moan about this having an 'alien/sci-fi' feel to it. Well, he may not burst out of peoples chests or lay eggs, but Superman IS technically alien, so get over it people.This is a fresh re-boot & take on the Superman series, the same as how Batman Begins was a fresh re-boot for the batman series (yet that was praised), so to be honest, I have no idea why there's so much negativity surrounding Man Of Steel.This movie was absolutely fantastic, and for me it was actually refreshing to see Kent being portrayed as a normal man. I know why Kent was made out to be an accident prone mess in previous movies, but in all honesty it was a really nice change to see him the way he was in this film.Man Of Steel is a true blockbuster in every sense of the word. The scale was massive, the action was superb, and the visual & special effects were amazing. The 1st hour or so is a wee bit slow in places, but it doesn't ever feel boring. The last hour, though, most definitely makes up for any of the earlier slower paced parts as the action is absolutely non-stop and relentless.This movie is also a lot darker than previous versions bringing it's own unique mood and style and I loved that also as I'm a fan of the more darker comic book style than the lighter one. Henry Cavill does a great job and is excellent as Superman as well.In all honesty I really cannot fault this movie at all as I loved it from start to finish. If the next Superman movie is anything like this one, then I can't wait.",9,5,8,16 January 2015
The Revenant," Worth ALL The Hype!
","A note to light-hearted movie goers: The Revenant is not for you.Life pits it's will on Hugh Glass, the real-life tracker & fur trapper played excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio. And director Alejandro G. Iñárritu damn near tortures his cast & audience in telling the story of Glass' revenge against the people, headed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who done him wrong. Set in the untamed West of 1823, this is one brutal epic piece of film making. The visionary result is so relentlessly raw some of the actors referred to the filming as a living hell and watching the movie, you can feel their pain.The movie doesn't take long to get started and you can barely even get your bearings of what's going on before Glass and his expedition are attacked by Arikara Indians and as mayhem ensues, Glass strives to protect his half-Pawnee son, Hawk. But that is all tame in comparison for what is about to come. I am, of course, talking about the infamous fight scene where a mother grizzly (protecting her cubs) lays into Glass like a demon possessed. Make no mistake - this scene is as brutal as it comes and while you know that it's all 'film trickery', it still doesn't stop you from believing it's real when you're actually watching it unfold.The whole movie, though, and not just that scene, is a visceral punch in the gut. You could gripe about the excess carnage and lack of philosophical substance, but surviving nature is Iñárritu's subject here, and he delivers with brilliance. And then there's DiCaprio. Hidden behind a grotty beard, his words are mostly reduced to grunts, but he nonetheless provides a portrait of a man in full. It's a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and is well deserving of his Oscar nomination & winThe Revenant is one of those movies that justifies it's hype, award nominations and wins. Definitely a must see film.",8,0,0,6 February 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Not The Best In The Series But A Very Good Addition
","Rogue Nation is the latest enjoyable addition to the M:I series although for me this one didn't really thrill me as much as the 3rd or 4th films. Don't get me wrong - this film is big on action, has plenty of excitement, and has amazing visuals, but there was just something lacking here that the other films (apart from M:I-2) had. Whether it's because originality is starting to lack, that a lot of the action is starting to get a bit repetitive, or that it's starting to become a bit predictable, or maybe a mix of all three, I don't know, but I DO know that parts of this M:I film fell a bit flat at times.With all that being said, however, Rogue Nation is still worth viewing and there's more than enough throughout the film to keep you watching, whether it's the usual comedy relief that comes from Benji or the high-risk situations Hunt always gets himself into. I may have found it starting to get repetitive as I said earlier, but it is still enjoyable.One other thing I noticed with this film (and the M:I films in general) is that the plot's are becoming more complex as the series goes on. This isn't a Fast & Furious kind of film where you can switch it on about half way through and pick up instantly what's happening. This is a film where you definitely have to pay attention to what's going on because it's pretty easy to get lost if you don't. Maybe that's why some people are saying that sections of the film 'didn't make sense'. I've also seen some say that nothing about the film was over-the-top. I have to disagree because from the first film to this latest one, there are plenty of moments which are over-the-top (the motorcycle stunts in M:I-2, Cruise clinging to the outside of an Airbus in Rogue Nation just to name two), but this IS Mission: Impossible after all. The whole series is based on making the impossible possible.Rogue Nation isn't the best in the series but it's a very decent addition. It will be interesting to see what M:I-6 brings us.",7,1,3,17 July 2016
Collateral," It's Not Leon But It's Still A Pretty Solid Hit-man Movie
","Collateral is brought to us by Michael Mann, the man who has done films like Manhunter, Heat and Last Of The Mohicans. My own personal opinion is that Heat is the best film Mann has done and while Collateral isn't on the same level as that, it's still a good action/suspense thriller. Anyone who has seen any of Michael Mann's films know that this isn't going to be an over-the-top action film where there's more gunfire than story and has a leading star who comes out with more bad one-liners than a low-rate stand-up comic.The story of the film is quite a simple one, but the way it's filmed is what takes it from a simple story to a great one. Mann has a way of making a seemingly slow movie much more interesting and suspenseful to watch, and he does this with Collateral. There are parts in the movie that had a danger of being repetitive and boring, but the way that the story and suspense is built up for these scenes there's no worries of them becoming either.Also, you may think to yourself 'Tom Cruise?! As a hit-man? Yeh right!' But in all honesty, he does a really good job of playing a hit-man. Granted, he's no Leon but he still does a good convincing job in the role of Vincent. Jamie Foxx does an equally good job in his role as playing Max, an L.A. cab driver simply trying to make some extra money to start his own business.The interaction between the two makes for good viewing as there are quite a good few moments in the movie where you wonder how Max is going to get out of the situations that he's being put in. The only let down for me cast wise was Jada Pinkett Smith because she can't act to save herself and this is one of the few roles I've seen her in where she's not over-acting playing a stereo typical head bobbing, finger pointing, snarling black woman. Thankfully she isn't in this movie a lot, however, which is a relief.Collateral is definitely worth watching and if you love movies like Heat and Leon then you should enjoy this one.",6,0,1,17 January 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," Much More Enjoyable Than The Previous Films
","The Amazing Spider-Man is a far superior film to any of the previous Sam Raimi Spider-man movies and it defies logic how anyone could like those movies over this. The action, the casting, the performances, the visuals...everything was so much better, and thankfully this version was MUCH less cheesy i.e. 'You're the one who's out Gobby, out of your mind'. I mean really?! The previous movies did have some decent comedic moments, but overall they were just mediocre action movies with decent CGI.This version however, is a film with much better action and has excellent CGI AND practical effects. This film used much more practical effects than the previous movies, so it's pretty funny to see people praising the Raimi films while calling this a 'CGI crap-fest'. The visuals are anything but crap and they interweave seamlessly with the live action scenes. Some of the action CGI from the previous films you could tell was CGI, but here you can't and if you say you can then you're talking rubbish. Some of the scripting may be a bit predictable, but no more predictable than what we've seen previously.Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-man does an absolute bang up job and is the much better actor at playing these two roles than Tobey Maguire. Macguire did play a good 'nerd' for Parker, but he was very two dimensional with his performances. Plus a jellyfish has more of a backbone than Maguire's Parker. I much preferred Garfield's version of Parker where he is seen more of a loner than a nerd and he captured this well in his performance. Even though she was playing a different character, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was far, far less annoying than Kirsten Dunst so that was a much added bonus. Sally Field, Martin Sheen, Denis Leary, and Rhys Ifans were all great in their individual roles as well, and the cameo scene involving Stan Lee in the library was a nice touch.This Spider-man film completely out-classes the Raimi version and you'd be nuts to think otherwise.",8,1,3,16 February 2015
Inside Out," Not As Good As I Was Hoping, But Still Very Enjoyable
","I have to admit - even though I enjoyed Inside Out, I don't think it was really as good as some other Disney/Pixar movies I've seen, such as Wreck It Ralph, Brave, or the Toy Story series. That doesn't mean to say it's not worth watching because it is, but it just got a bit stale through the middle where it's a wee bit stop/start in certain places, and got a bit repetitive with some of the characters. For instance, Sadness would touch something she's not 'supposed' to and Joy would keep telling her not to as they went from one disaster to the next. It becomes logical at the end, I know, but still felt too repetitive like I say.I think that's my only real complaint and it's probably that that stopped me from giving the film a 4-Star rating because I loved everything else. The animation, the story, the humour, the whole idea on a person's long term/short term memory, subconscious, how the emotions are made to control a person etc.It really is a very imaginative story.The whole thing actually reminded me of my days as a kid when I used to read comics called The Beano, The Beezer, and The Dandy that featured a comic strip called The Numskulls...same concept as the film but obviously on a much smaller scale.It's a pretty emotional film as well as we're taken on a journey right from the start of Riley's life...growing up with her, going through her emotions as she reaches those early teen years, the ups and the downs along with her parents. Not to dissimilar to Up, actually (which I enjoyed)...another of Pete Docter's animated films. So with that, you feel a kind of connection to everything that happens to Riley, which, for me, is good because it helps draw you into the story much more.Be prepared for one tear-jerker of a scene though.The whole movie overall is a very enjoyable experience, and while it's not as good as I was hoping, it's still another memorable Disney/Pixar flick.",7,1,22,9 January 2016
Resident Evil," A Good Game-To-Film Adaptation
","The Umbrella Corporation is a top secret company operating from a massive underground facility known as The Hive. After a deadly virus is released into the air, resulting in the deaths of all who work there, an elite squad of soldiers is sent in to shut down The Hive before the virus has a chance to escape into general population of the city above. It's here that they come across Alice (Mila Jovovich) who has no memory of who or where she is. As they continue down into The Hive, Alice starts to regain her memory bit by bit, but they all soon discover that shutting down the The Hive is the least of their worries when they learn that the human population have returned to life as vicious zombies.Resident Evil is one of the much more enjoyable game-to-movie adaptations as usually these are pretty mediocre or just plain awful (Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Super Mario Bros. etc), and fans of the game should be pretty pleased with this movie version as well, especially as the makers of the movie have brought in the formidable creature known as Licker who features in the game also.The action for the movie is really good, which is accompanied by a pumping soundtrack to get the adrenalin going that wee bit more as well. A good few special effects are really well done also, especially in the scene that involves the Red Queen using a laser as a defence system, and the effects for Licker was impressive making it just as scary in the film as it was in the game.Just one thing - this isn't a gore-fest of a zombie movie either and concentrates more toward the story, so if you're expecting (or hoping for) lots of splatter then you'll be highly disappointed.Resident Evil is an enjoyable film to watch. It's not a thinker of a movie, obviously, but it's not supposed to be and doesn't pretend to be either. Also, don't expect an exact game-to-movie film. It's an adaptation OF the game, so enjoy it for what it is - a good zombie horror/sci-fi action film.",6,3,4,15 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Story Of Bilbo Continues And Is Told Excellently Here
","After successfully passing through the Misty Mountains, Bilbo Baggins and his dwarf companions must seek aid from a powerful stranger before taking on the dangers of Mirkwood Forest...unfortunately without Gandalf. If they reach the human settlement of Laketown it will be time for Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract. The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and find out how to open the Secret Door which will give them access to the vast hoarde inside along with the Arkenstone that the dwarfs all seek. There's just one tiny problem...the great dragon, Smaug, has claimed the treasures inside as his own.Everything that is in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - the cinematography, the occasional dry humour, the massive scale, the great fight scenes, and the absolutely amazing special & visual effects - can be seen in this next installment. Unfortunately, one thing that is here that wasn't in An Unexpected Journey is the slower pace because the first 1½ hours of the film does seem to drag on a touch. Thankfully it picked up much more in the last hour which bumped up the rating for me.While I feel the the majority of the film was made fantastically and looked great, I think that some of the fight scenes between Legolas and the orcs, lead by the Necromancer, was a touch over the top i.e. Legolas balancing on two dwarfs heads, travelling at speed down a river, while fighting orcs with his bow and arrow. I know that the elven community are graceful warriors in these films, but I just felt that some of the fighting was too much.Other than that, this is still a must-see film, and for those moaning that the film is different from the book...it's a film ADAPTATION, folks! Plus, the films are beefed out, so to speak, because The Hobbit, unlike Lord Of The Rings, is not a trilogy.This may be not as good as the 1st part, but still an enjoyable ride nonetheless. Looking forward to The Battle of the Five Armies now.",7,3,5,17 January 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," Another Superb Disney Animation
","Wreck It Ralph tells the story of Ralph, a video game character that is tired of being the 'bad guy' all the time and sets out on an adventure to find a way of becoming a 'good guy', but inadvertently causes madness & mayhem as he goes.Disney have done it again with yet another animation classic in Wreck It Ralph. I loved this movie for a number of reasons, one being that it was a wee trip down memory lane in seeing characters from games I used to play as a kid, including Sonic the Hedgehog; Ken, Ryu, M. Bison and Zangief from the Street Fighter games; Kane from Mortal Kombat (one of my favourite games of all time); and Pac-Man. Even the two stick figures playing tennis from Pong are shown.Some really good ideas enter into the movie as well, such as Game Central Station (which is basically a huge socket adapter that the arcade machines all get plugged in to) where all the game characters travel to and from their games when the arcade is closed. Another is the Bad-Anon which is a villains support group for any of the games bad guys for when they are feeling unhappy about their roles.As we have come to expect from Disney movies as well the animation is absolutely superb. The way the animation gets handled between the different games in the movie is excellent also, going from the graphics we saw in the old console/arcade games where they were more blocky and jerkier (which was cutting edge back then) to the more sublime, smoother graphics we see for the newer games nowadays.This is a movie that will appeal to all kids and adults alike. Some of the humour in the movie may be classed as a bit 'crude' by some (over-protective) parents, but these jokes will just go right over the heads of the younger kids (just like some jokes in the Shrek movies), so it's really nothing to worry about at all.I think this is the best Disney animation movie that I've seen probably since Despicable Me, so I would definitely recommend it if you've not seen it yet.",8,3,4,10 December 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Another Classic Addition To The Lord Of The Rings Films
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes us back to Middle Earth, but this time it's the telling of the story of Bilbo Baggins and his, well, unexpected adventure in how he comes to help dwarfs reclaim their kingdom and how he come to find the one ring.This movie's an absolute eye feast and is just as big as Peter Jackson's other Lord of the Ring's movies. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the photography's amazing and the cast of characters are really well done, with actors like McKellen, Serkis, Lee etc reprising their roles. Maybe the battle scenes are not as big, but that's obviously a given as this is 13 dwarfs, a wizard and a hobbit who engage in battle scenes and not a massive army.As a personal side note, regarding the two or three dwarfs who have Scottish accents...it was very refreshing to hear REAL Scottish accents from REAL Scottish actors. Being from Scotland myself, there's nothing worse in hearing a grounds keeper Willie or Christopher Lambert Highlander-type Scottish accent in movies. Another wee thing I'm glad about is the rating. The PG13 keeps the scenes that are supposed to be tense and creepy as such and are not toned down to seem 'cartoonish'. It would have been totally unjustified to have made these scenes anything less than what they were supposed to be as the sense of atmosphere they bring is excellent.Now, ardent followers of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books will no doubt complain about things that are in the book but not the move, or things that are in the movie but aren't in the book, but this is a movie adaptation and it's not as if the book was butchered like what Stanley Kubrick done to The Shining (even though that was still a fantastic movie in it's own right). I've read the book and enjoyed that, and now I've seen this 1st part to the movie adaptation and thoroughly enjoyed that. I can only hope that the next part is just as enjoyable as this one.I definitely recommend seeing this movie.",9,0,2,14 January 2015
Non-Stop," Getting On A Bit Now But Neeson Still Kicks A**
","Bill Marks is a former NYPD officer now enrolled as a US Air Marshall. During a flight from New York to London, he receives a text messages saying that if $150million isn't transferred into an specific account then someone will die every 20 minutes. Breaking protocol, Marks consults with Jack Hammond, the other Air Marshall that is on the flight, but he merely tries to brush the incident off. As time passes, Marks begins to realise that as he tries to find out who the demand is coming from, he himself is possibly being framed as a terrorist.Non-Stop is the latest Action/Thriller to star Liam Neeson and it's a cracker. Neeson plays these parts so well and brings about a real believability to the characters he plays in these films. The main plot is a fairly simple one...bad guy wants $150million or people start to die. However, said story starts to quickly develop and it's not long before it starts to twist and turn into various directions that will keep the audience guessing as to what will happen next and to who the possible bad guy - or woman - is.At times, the story may be a bit 'unrealistic' but this isn't a Documentary here so if you're expecting a film full of 'true events' then you've rented the wrong movie. Non-Stop doesn't take long to get going at all and it grabs your attention pretty much right off the bat....exactly the way a good Action/Thriller should. It's not got a seriously complex story that just confuses the hell out of you, and it's not one of those action films that's full of action but has no story. It's got both a good story mixed with good action & suspense.The acting is top notch as well, which is what we would expect from stars such as Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, whose character, by the way, ends up being on your list of suspects in some way or another. With talk of a possible sequel in the works, let's just hope that if it does happen, then it's as good as this one.",8,0,0,19 January 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A Somewhat Subdued Sequel
","It's now 5 years on, and both dragons & vikings live together in peace. The Viking leader, Stoic, is trying to prepare Hiccup for leadership, but Hiccup is more interested in exploring uncharted territories with his faithful dragon, Toothless. Their exploration leads them to a secret ice cave far from the island of Berk, and it's here that they discover the island is home to hundreds of dragons and a mysterious Dragon Rider. Before long, Hiccup & Toothless find themselves in the middle of a battle to help protect the dragons from the evil Drago who is trying to organise a massive dragon army. Only time will tell if Hiccup and the rest of the Viking's will succeed in rescuing the dragons.How To Train Your Dragon 2 turned out to be a pretty enjoyable animation movie...eventually. I say eventually because it actually took a wee while to get going and was pretty slow for the 1st 30 minutes or so but it does get better as it goes on. The animation was superb and you can actually see a difference between the 1st and 2nd films.Plot wise, however, the two are about the same which is that they are both pretty mediocre when it comes to story, although there is a nice wee twist in the 2nd film. The plot isn't the only thing that lacks slightly either as there isn't all that much humour. I mean there are moments that will make you chuckle, but it's not on the same level as Brave, Wreck It Ralph, or the Despicable Me films, and it could be a case where kids may find it funnier than adults.One other thing that slightly annoyed me was the terrible Scottish accent from Cate Blanchett for her character of Valka. Why movie makers do this is beyond me because if they wanted the character to be Scottish, then they should have brought in a Scottish actor.Anyway, even with all this mentioned, and I know it may not seem like it with what I have said, this is still a pretty enjoyable movie.

It Follows," Another Hugely Over-Hyped 'Clever' Film
","I was looking forward to seeing this film since I saw the trailers for it as it looked to be a very creepy, tense, clever, and atmospheric horror (which is what I enjoy watching). I was actually eager to watch it and there's not been many films recently I can say that about. Unfortunately, I was hugely disappointed after watching it as It Follows is a MASSIVE let down, and I can't actually believe that it has been rated so highly.Now, people will probably say 'Oh, you don't get it' or 'you don't like it because there was no blood & guts'...you know, the typical childish responses you get when you criticise a 'clever' film. Well, I'm not thick, and a horror doesn't have to have a ton of gore for me to enjoy, but this was just a very poor telling of what could - and should - have been a much, much creepier film.It Follows started off well enough, setting up what I thought would be a good tone & atmosphere for the rest of the movie. It didn't pan out that way because while the tone & atmosphere were decent enough (in part), it was severely lacking in a lot of other areas such as...1) Acting: this was VERY poor, and after the scenes with Annie at the start of the movie, some of the acting was less than convincing. Almost B-movie esk at times.2) Thrills: a complete minimal amount of this and it was more boring than thrilling.3) Scare/creep factor: definitely NOT a scary film and only two or three moments from throughout were creepy and gave off an uneasy feel.4) Pace: absolutely none. The film just crawled along at snail's pace from start to end.Oh, and speaking of the ending - what a huge disappointment that also was. I detest movies that end the way It Follows ended, but in a way it was spot on for this film as it capped off a perfectly over-hyped, slow, boring, and disappointing 'horror'.Honestly, don't be taken in by the hype surrounding this film, but if you decide to watch it then good luck. I just hope you enjoy it more than what I did.",3,29,55,2 August 2015
Legend," An Enjoyable Telling Of London's Most Notorious Gangsters
","I had been looking forward to seeing Legend since I knew of it's making and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed with this latest telling of the Krays infamous legacy. I'm not a 'know-it-all' when it comes to the Krays, but I've been intrigued about them, their reign and how they came to be probably since The Krays (1990) was released. Legend was another chance to have a brief look into the lives of London's most feared criminals of the 50s and 60s.This telling of the Krays story starts off by showing the two brothers already at the height of their power in the 60s and doesn't give much telling prior to their reign or of their upbringing which is a bit disappointing as that's a bit like entering a movie theater halfway through. Legend focuses more ON their legacy rather than that AND their lives prior which, like I say, is disappointing, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.As I mentioned earlier, The Krays (1990) is where I first started to gather interest in the twins and that film itself is an excellent watch with the Kemp Bros. giving really good performances. The main differences between the two films are the violence and the telling of the brothers early lives. Some of the violence in The Krays is quite brutal and the most violent it gets in Legend is the odd shooting, stabbing, and gang brawl. With the performance Hardy gives playing the two brothers, however, it's still enough to show that the Krays were not to be messed with.Performance wise, Hardy's double role as the twins is nothing short of excellent with his different portrayals making it seem as if you're watching him and an identical Hardy brother. The cast all over do a very good job, but Hardy is the obvious standout, and the filming of his roles was handled really well especially when the two characters are on screen together.If you enjoy gangster drama's such as The Godfather, Casino & Goodfellas then you won't go far wrong with Legend.",7,0,0,23 March 2017
Django Unchained," Another Tarantino Classic
","Django Unchained is the story of a freed slave who becomes the partner of a German bounty hunter. Together they set off on a mission to release a certain slave owned by ruthless plantation owner, Calvin Candie, that slave being Djangos wife.In all honesty I had some reservations about this movie as it didn't look to be anything too great, but I thought I'd give it a go and I was not disappointed. Out of the Tarantino movies I've seen not many have disappointed...Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs just to name some, are all superb and while Django Unchained is not on the same level as those for me, its not too far off.Now, if you're expecting the usual Tarantino style of action, blood and violence then you'll be sorely disappointed. I mean there is good amount of action in it (especially the last 30 minutes) but its just not the main story character. There's a few good comedy moments as well, with one favourite of mine being when a lynch mob are talking about whether to wear their hoods or not. I know - that doesn't sound funny but when you watch the movie you'll understand what I mean.There's a number of very obvious spaghetti western style moments too, such as the ultra-fast camera zoom, but all this adds to the style of Django Unchained.As for the characters, the relationship between Django (Foxx) and Dr. King Schultz (Waltz) is 1st class. They play off each other so well and they make what is already a good movie that bit better. DiCaprio was fantastic bringing a cold, calculating side to the already vicious streak of Calvin Candie. Jackson was excellent (as usual) as Stephen, Candies slave house master, and in one way is more ruthless than Candie because of the way even he treats the slaves.On the whole, whether you're a die-hard Tarantino fan, a period action/drama fan, or a fan of both, Django Unchained is definitely worth a watch and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",7,2,6,10 December 2014
Insidious," Dark & Creepy....My Kind Of Movie
","Josh (Patrick Wilson) & Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert, along with their baby and two other children, have moved into a new home, but not before long Renai starts to experience strange incidents. These incidents, for the most part, just get ignored, but things change dramatically when their son, Dalton, doesn't wake up one morning. Seeking any help they can, they turn to Elise Rainier, a spiritual psychic, and learn that their son has the ability to astro-project and is actually trapped by a hideous demon in a realm known as The Further. Desperate to get their son back, Josh has to enter The Further to get Dalton back before it's too late.Insidious is a really good and a very creepy movie. The first 30 - 40 minutes are a wee bit slow to be honest with not much happening, but even though it's a bit slow it does build the story & tension up nicely, leading into the last hour which is where it gets much better. It doesn't really rely on the 'jump-boo' scares either - although there are a couple of good moments of those - but plays more on the psychological scares of just making you feel really uneasy and creeped out....and it works great.The main demon is done really well, and even though you don't see a whole great deal of it, you definitely see enough for it to freak you out. This works really well because with a lot of these kinds of movies it's what you don't see that can actually scare you. Sometimes the thing that scares you the most is your own imagination and this is what Insidious plays on. It doesn't rely on gore or intense violence either. It's just a really good, creepy psychological horror.If you enjoy creepy horrors such as The Conjuring, Sinister and The Amityville Horror then you should enjoy Insidious. Put the lights off, turn the sound up and sit back and enjoy.",7,1,2,16 January 2015
Frozen," Got To Say It....Good But Vastly Overrated
","Frozen is the story of two sisters, Elsa and Anna, who are extremely close as children. Elsa possesses a magical ability to create ice and snow, but unfortunately after an accident endangers the life of Anna, Elsa locks herself away in her bedroom, growing up alone. Elsa eventually appears but only for her coronation. However, after a series of events trap the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter, Elsa runs away. Anna sets out to find her sister, and along the way she meets Kristoff and his trusty reindeer, Sven. Together, they set out to find Elsa so that they can help her and restore Arendelle back to normal.We've come to expect the animation in Disney movies to be excellent, but it's definitely something to behold in Frozen, especially on Blu-ray. Everything is crystal clear and amazing to watch, especially the vast winter landscapes the movie is set in. The animation, as stunning as it was, isn't everything though, and Frozen had the danger of being one of the most boring Disney films I had seen because of the amount of musical numbers that are in the 1st half of the movie. I enjoy old classic Disney movies that have musical numbers in them like The Jungle Book, The Aristocats, and The Lion King, but they weren't overloaded with musical numbers like Frozen. Thankfully, the musical numbers become few and far between and this is when the movie got MUCH better.The movie has very likable characters with the classic comic relief part coming in the form of a snowman named Olaf. The voice cast do a good job and all work well together and there isn't really one annoying voice/character to put you off. It's just a pity, with all of the positives that the movie had in the 2nd half of the movie, along with the animation throughout, that it wasn't this strong to start with because if the song numbers were kept down then this could easily have been one of the best animated movies from the last few years.Frozen was good but could have been so much better.",6,4,7,17 January 2015
The Bourne Legacy," Not A Patch On The Other Three
","I was looking forward to this movie as a continuation in the Bourne franchise, but it was ultimately a huge let down. I wasn't expecting to see Jason Bourne as I knew that this film is not really about him per say and is more focused on the program that created agents and assassins like Jason Bourne.This latest addition starts off well, and it actually came as a nice surprise that the events in this movie are taking place at the same time as what is happening in the other Bourne movies. Unfortunately, this movie gets to a point where it suddenly goes off on it's own tangent, so it feels as if it started out as one movie but ended up being another that only uses the Bourne name. What made the first three movies so excellent to watch was the fast-paced action & story and how it combined those together. However, even though this movie does have it's good moments, it failed to deliver for the main part and tended to get pretty slow, struggling to keep my attention.A promising movie but ultimately ended up being a complete disappointment in all honesty.",4,0,2,21 September 2014
Unknown," Another Very Enjoyable Neeson/Collet-Serra Outing
","Along with Taken, Non-Stop, and the impressive looking Run All Night, Unknown is another excellent Action/Thriller to star Liam Neeson, and once again he does a great job with his role (he seems to suit these parts so well).Here we see Neeson take up the role of Dr. Martin Harris, a biochemist who is travelling to Germany for a conference but before he can attend the conference, he is involved in a car accident that almost kills him. After waking from a 4-day coma, he soon discovers that someone has apparently taken his identity, and no one - not even his wife - believes that he is the real Dr. Martin Harris.This film has it all....great action, suspense, mystery, and a good couple of twists along the way just to keep it even more interesting (especially the main twist at the end). Are some of the scenes unrealistic? Of course. Are they ridiculous, though? Definitely not. There's a difference between unrealistic and unrealistically ridiculous and Unknown falls into the former with these scenes. The thing is, this is an Action/Thriller....if you want pure realism & true to life then watch a Documentary. You get exactly what you pay for with Unknown.Apart from a few dialogue moments here and there, the film is well written, and even though it's not the most original of story's, it is still more than capable of holding it's own for pure entertainment value. You will notice that Unknown bears huge resemblances to The Bourne Identity (and even Taken to a certain extent), but this shouldn't put you off enjoying what is an enjoyable Action/Thriller.The cast all do fantastic jobs with their characters as well, from Neeson, Kruger, Jones, and Quinn all great in the main starring roles, to Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg as Smith & Jones (no, not THOSE Smith & Jones), who bring such a menace to their characters that you find yourself routing for the 'good guys' that little bit more.Unknown is definitely one to watch, so watch it and enjoy it.",8,0,0,25 March 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Much Better Than People Would Lead You To Believe
","So much negativity for a film that is far, far superior to the Raimi cheese-fest astounds me that it's a kin to praising Pearl Harbour over Saving Private Ryan in my opinion.This version, like it's prequel, is so much better than any of the Raimi films in all aspects from action, story, and CGI that it's no contest for me. In saying that though, I think the only part of this version I didn't really like was the way the Green Goblin was portrayed. He actually looked like a cross between Wolverine and a leprechaun and he was more laughable than menacing. Other than that however, this is a much more enjoyable film than any of the others.The story for the film, while being pretty predictable, is very decent for a super hero movie. I mean, how many super hero movies can have an Award-winning story that is NOT original or predictable? They are all the same in one way or another so for this story to be criticised more over others is a bit laughable. There is more of a 'love story' with this sequel as well between Stacy and Parker, but unlike the way the annoying relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson was portrayed in the Raimi films, this one is not insufferable. And that's coming from a guy who hates any sort of romance in movies.The main cast done a stand-up job once again with Garfield and Stone doing well with their continuation of Parker/Spider-man and Gwen Stacy. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were excellent in their roles as Electro/Max Dillon and Green Goblin/Harry Osborn respectively, especially DeHaan as Harry Osborn who brought a sly, sneaky, and very snake-like menace to the character. I also liked the Stan Lee cameo again in this one....it wasn't as good as his cameo in the 1st film, but it was still a nice touch.Sam Raimi may have brought us a more up-to-date take on Spider-man but Marc Webb has made the franchise more enjoyable with less cheese. Ignore the hate and judge for yourself....you may just enjoy it as much as I did.",8,49,88,18 February 2015
Big Hero 6," A Decent Animation But Still Misses The Mark Somewhat
","Big Hero 6 was more like The Humdrum 5 for me, because there was nothing really all that fantastic about this movie, and it ended up being just an average run-of-the-mill animation, which is a pity because from the previews it looked like a really enjoyable film. For $165m I'd have hoped for something better too.Don't get me wrong...this isn't an awful movie, and it IS a decent watch, but I think it just lacked any real character depth, the plot (even for an animation) got a bit too ridiculous, and it was pretty dull in places. I think the younger audience (the 8-13 range) will enjoy this movie more because of the super hero element, but most adults may find it a bit lackluster.Big Hero 6 actually started out quite well, but it just got to a certain point where it ended up being a completely different film to how it started off, and the end was too much like Stargate (which was a boring movie itself).It all just kind of stagnated in parts, and none more so than the majority of the main characters, because apart from Baymax really, they were pretty bland and just lacked any sort of real depth. Fred was OK and was quite funny in places, but as for Go Go (who annoyed the Hell out of me with her stereotypical 'chick with attitude' trait), Wasabi, and Honey Lemon, none would have been missed if they were suddenly not there.Thankfully, Baymax was the true highlight of this film, and a lot of scenes involving him were pretty humorous. One scene being when Baymax's batteries were low causing him to act 'drunk'...that whole scene was played out like a sober person trying to get his drunk buddy home to bed. I also enjoyed the scene where Baymax casually used Scotch Tape to patch up some punctures he received. The humour was simple but it worked so well with him. It's just a pity the humour was lacking elsewhere.Big Hero 6 is definitely like Frozen & Tangled...it's not a bad film but it's vastly overrated.Pity it couldn't have been great like Wreck It Ralph.",6,3,31,23 April 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," A Thin Story But An Enjoyable Sequel Nonetheless
","After surviving the horrors of The Hive and managing to escape, Alice (Mila Jovovich) discovers that the T-Virus has found it's way into Raccoon City resurrecting the dead. On her route to try and get out the city, she comes across other bands of survivors and they join forces to try and escape before the Umbrella Corporation resorts to extreme measures in 'cleansing' the city. To do this, though, they first need to rescue the daughter of Dr. Ashford (the creator of the T-Virus) who is still within in the city limits. This will be made all the more harder, however, as the Umbrella Corporation have sent in a formidable opponent to stop them...Nemesis.Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a pretty decent sequel to the enjoyable Resident Evil movie, and is made much more enjoyable with the introduction of Nemesis. Thankfully, Nemesis makes more than just one solitary appearance as he is such a formidable character & presence (just like Pyramid Head in Silent Hill), and I'd maybe go as far as to say that if it wasn't for that character then the movie may have lacked a wee bit even with all the other action.The action in the movie is pretty relentless from start to finish with a good few impressive action scenes, two of which being the church scene involving Alice and three Lickers, and the action following the scene where Alice runs face first down a 200 foot building.The story line continues on from the 1st movie, but never really develops much until the final few scenes which lead onto the 3rd film, so don't expect much from this sequel story-wise.The acting is a wee bit dire in some places, mainly from Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine, but thankfully it's not bad enough to actually throw you off from watching the film.All in all, like I say, this is a decent sequel and even if you're not familiar with the game series, it's still an enjoyable action flick.",6,1,2,15 January 2015
Evil Dead," A Classic, Hard-Hitting Remake
","The Evil Dead is about 5 twenty-somethings who take a trip to a cabin in the woods where two siblings - Mia and David - used to spend their time growing up. Not long after arriving, the group discover an old witch-craft book called the Book of the Dead, but one of the group members unknowingly brings an evil demon to life after reading from the book, so it's not long before all hell starts to break loose.Now, I know that the film industry has come a long way since 1981 (when the original was made), but let's be honest - the original is a camp, low-budget flick with just a few scares which is cheesier than a cheddar factory. Whether that was intentional or not, I don't know, but when you read what a movie's about and has the title Evil Dead then this new version is what I'd be expecting...not the Edam one. I've never understood why the original gets such rave reviews as it's just a bad-acted, mediocre film.Anyway, enough about the crappy original and onto this much better version. This one is extremely dark and is most definitely not for the squeamish. There are a few scenes that will definitely make you flinch & feel uneasy and for one of these scenes all I'll say is 'tongue' and 'knife'. It's obvious the makers of this version wanted to go with unsettling, gory and relentless instead of laughable, badly-acted and boring and credit to them for doing that.The make-up was fantastic, as were the visual effects. It may be sometimes obvious or predictable on what is going to happen at times, but the vast majority of these of horrors are, and if you're let down by some predictability in a horror movie like this then you're pretty naive.I actually really enjoyed this version. We know it was never going to be a Hollywood Oscar-winner or an all-time 'classic', but just watch it for what it is...a very gory, squeamish - and sometimes unsettling - horror film. Ignore the original and go with this one instead as it's much better.",7,1,5,14 January 2015
Clash of the Titans," Release The Kracken....Again
","After defeating the Titans, the Gods created mortals, whose faith & prayers would assure their immortality. However, through time, the mortals lose their faith in the Gods so they stop praying and also destroy a statue of Zeus. To punish the mortals' defiance, Hades is given leave by Zeus to go to the city of Argos to tell King Cepheus & Queen Cassiopeia that if Princess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Gods, he will release the Kracken to destroy them & their city. Perseus, who lost his family when Hades arrived, learns here that he is a demigod, son to Zeus, and that he is the only one who can defeat the Gods and save Argos.Devout fans of the original 1981 Clash of the Titans will probably hate this film without even seeing it and will treat it as some sort of blasphemy but in all honesty this version is actually a very decent remake. Is it better? Well, yes and no. It's not any better (or worse for that matter) for telling a version of the story of Perseus defeating the Kracken, but it's obviously miles better in showing that story with the acting, action, and the visuals.Obviously the original version is extremely dated now, but it's still a classic in it's own right, and while the effects will probably be laughed at by a lot of people these days, for 1981 they were cutting edge and were well done, especially for the time. Will this be classed as a classic? I very much doubt it, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching and it doesn't mean that both cannot be enjoyed just as much equally.The visuals & the effects are fantastic all round, especially for the Kracken, and while the Medusa scenes were decent, I must admit the original film's showing was better, not because of the action or the effects, but because of the sheer mood & creepy atmosphere. Even to this day, I remember watching those scenes when I was about 7 or 8 and being genuinely creeped out.This isn't a jaw-dropper by any stretch, but it's still a very good movie.",6,0,0,19 January 2015
Jurassic World," Extremely Enjoyable Addition To The Jurrasic Park Series
","When I first heard another Jurassic film was being done, I did wonder what direction it would be taken, and how they could improve the series. I mean let's face it...more people lost on an island again wouldn't have been very original. I didn't dislike them, but thankfully massive improvements was made from The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.I loved Jurassic Park. I thought the second film was decent enough, and the third was enjoyable even if it was very thin story-wise. Jurassic World, though, wipes the floor with the previous two films, and for me was almost just as enjoyable as the first. I enjoyed a lot of the homages to the previous films as well and they were nice touches.The film took a wee while to get going for me, and there were moments where I thought it was going to be a bit cheesy and full of cliché's, but thankfully this wasn't the case. Yes, there are cliché's scattered throughout the movie, but what film doesn't? It started off a bit 'ho-hum' but it most definitely got better as it went on. Was the majority of it predictable? Pretty much, but it didn't make it any less entertaining.I think the biggest cliché's were some of the characters, mainly that of Owen (Chris Pratt). Him being a rough, buff macho man who's an ex-Navy SEAL is as cliché as you can get, along with the 'love/hate' relationship between him & Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). I'm surprised they never had him shirtless at some point. Thankfully it didn't become a romantic cheese-fest...apart from them stopping right in the middle of things to lip-smack that is.The CGI, as we have come to expect, is amazing and if I'm honest the first film's effects were just as good. It's just that this time there was much more and all on a larger scale. People will probably moan about it being a 'CGI-fest', but at least this wasn't like Pacific Rim...all CGI and nothing else.Ignore the hate as this is definitely a must-see movie, especially if you loved the first film.",7,16,35,1 January 2016
Paranormal Activity," Not Brilliant But Still Enjoyably Creepy
","Paranormal Activity is centered around a rather likable couple - Katie & Micah - who have been experiencing some strange happenings in their home. Micah decides to try and document the various goings on, and as time goes on the friction between Katie & Micah gradually increases as do the various incidents until they all reach their final crescendo.Now, films that are shot in POV/first person perspective I usually enjoy as they have a way of drawing you in to what is actually happening because it's like you are seeing it through the eyes of someone else; as if you are right there yourself, and Paranormal Activity does this pretty well. It stays realistic to what can actually be someone's POV instead of taking it to stupid & ridiculous angles like what happened in My Little Eye.The scares that happen in Paranormal Activity are good, and they obviously get more intense & frequent as the film goes on, but to be honest it does get a wee bit boring during some of the more 'relaxed' moments. In saying that, however, it is a fine line for getting it right; if there are too many scares it can be overkill but if there are too few then it can get boring. Thankfully, though, Paranormal Activity is kept interesting enough for you to keep you watching.Just as a quick mention, the characters of Katie & Micah are pretty likable as I mentioned earlier, but there are occasions where they can get a wee bit annoying. For instance, Micah with his occasional macho 'I'll fix everything' attitude, and Katie's woman-type attitude where no matter what Micah does or suggest it's always wrong. In saying that, though, I guess that describes practically every couple in the real world! So, just to end, while Paranormal Activity is nowhere near the excellence of films like The Blair Witch Project or Sinister it's still worth a watch and is a pretty decent film.",6,0,0,10 December 2014
Prisoners," An Excellent Psychological Thriller
","When two young girls go missing, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is called in to head the case of trying to find the children before it's too late. Before long, suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is arrested, but is released to due lack of evidence. However, the father of one of the kidnapped girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), is irate that Jones has been released, so as Dover becomes more & more frustrated to know the location of his daughter, desperation takes over as he starts to take things into his own hands.OK, firstly, Prisoners is not a fast-paced movie at all, and if you don't like the more intricate, slower-paced movies then you will not enjoy this. Films of this pace draw a fine line...films that are slower but have an excellent story that immerse you, and films that are slower and boring. Thankfully, Prisoners is one of the former. It's 2½ hours long, but in all honesty if it was any shorter it wouldn't have done the story any justice at all as it would have been rushed and so many story lines wouldn't have been answered.Everything about this movie is really well done, and the cast do a great job of making a great story better, with one of the stand-outs being Hugh Jackman who plays Keller Dover, an ordinary husband & father who becomes obsessed with getting his daughter back no matter what it takes.The film takes you on a route that has many different twists and turns and poses so many thought provoking questions, with the main one being how far would you go if it were your child? Prisoners is a great movie and you'd be doing well to find a better crime thriller to watch this year. Highly recommended.",7,1,2,16 January 2015
Everest," Thoroughly Enjoyable
","Everest is a very enjoyable Action/Thriller but I'm not going to sit here and write as if I have in-depth knowledge about Rob Hall or the true events of what really happened in 1996. I will write about what I thought of a movie that was inspired by those true events, though.Now, like I said a moment ago, Everest is a very enjoyable film, but just be aware that it's a wee bit slow for about the first 45 minutes or so as it sets a foundation for story & character development. Notice how I say it's a 'wee bit slow' though and not boring. I personally never found any part of this film boring, even during it's slowest moments. It definitely picks up as it goes on however, and it ends up being an exciting & suspenseful true story adaptation. The tension is built very nicely and it creates an excellent sense of anticipation of what's to come as the climb continues, and because of the well made character development you feel a sense of attachment to the individual characters making you feel more saddened for each one's fate.The whole look of the film was superb, especially the later moments of the movie to make it seem as if everyone was scaling Everest. It probably wasn't hard to set the initial tone & feel of the movie with the cast & crew actually being in Nepal, but all the scenes that show everyone higher up the mountain were filmed really well and it did make you feel as if you going through their journey with them.Of course the cast definitely helped sell this too with their individual performances, which were all good. I thought he was wrongly cast as John Connor for Terminator Genisys, but Jason Clarke was excellent as Rob Hall, as was John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhall, and Josh Brolin for their respective roles as Doug Hansen, Scott Fischer, and Beck Weathers respectively.Everest is wonderfully directed with some amazing cinematography of Everest and surrounding areas of Nepal and it is most definitely well worth watching.",7,0,1,1 April 2016
Elysium," Another Matt Damon Classic
","In the year 2159, the earth has become an overpopulated, polluted and disease ridden place. A new 'habitat' called Elysium - a kind of space equivalent to an island paradise - has been created, but is a place where only the wealthy and rich are 'allowed' to live. It's also a place that is run by people who will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws. After a serious accident at his place of work, Max (Damon) is desperate to get to Elysium any way he can, but to do this he has to retrieve critical information from the CEO of Amardyne - the company that created & built Elysium -, John Carlyle (Fichtner). If Max succeeds, he will not only help himself but also millions of people on Earth.OK straight to the point here - Elysium is a fantastic action/sci-fi movie. The visual effects are stunning to say the least, and the acting is really top notch but in saying that with the likes of Foster, Damon and Copley it should be well acted. Foster brings a really good performance in playing Secretary Delacourt, a cold & heartless government official of Elysium; Copley is really impressive as Kruger, a ruthless Earth-based sleeper cell agent; and Damon once again brings it home as Max, an ex-con who works for Armadyne.Elysium also has a very District 9 (which I also loved) feel to it, and I suppose the two movies really aren't too dissimilar to each other with two parties wanting to get to their own 'paradise'. The movie itself isn't a non-stop action roller coaster ride and actually pays attention to story as well which is good. Don't get me wrong...the action in Elysium when it happens is excellent but it's not self-reliant on ONLY action like some films.Some people will do doubt find it slow or 'boring' in-between the action scenes, but I didn't find this the case at all, and even in these 'slower' moments the story still ticks along nicely and keeps your interest.All in all, I thought Elysium was brilliant and I definitely recommend watching it.",9,2,3,16 January 2015
Taken," An Excellent Action/Thriller
","Taken may have been released back in 2008, but to be honest it is still one of the best Action/Thrillers that's been released within the last 20 years, and the part of Bryan Mills is played superbly by Liam Neeson. This isn't an over-the-top Action/Thriller; it's not a cheesy Action/Thriller; it's also not an Action/Thriller that lacks in the story department either as so many can - and usually - do. Nope, Taken is one of the more rarer Action/Thrillers that delivers a decent story along with plenty of tense, high-paced action.Both the story and film start out decently enough, and continues at a steady enough pace instead of diving straight in with no backstory to anything. It gradually builds as it goes on and only increases in tension & pace from the moment that Mills' daughter is kidnapped. The build up to this moment alone was excellent...the suspense, the way the scene was edited together, and of course the 'I will find you' speech delivered perfectly by Neeson. All of that doesn't just stop at that scene, though, as the rest of the movie is pieced together fantastically as the action & intensity both increase.Neeson is perfect in the role as Bryan Mills and it's like it was made for him. This obviously isn't the 1st action film he's done, but don't think he's played this type of role very often - if at all - but he slot right into it with no problems. I learned that Jeff Bridges was offered the part before Neeson. No offence to Bridges, but I can't really picture him playing this kind of role and thankfully he dropped out paving the way for Neeson. Even though she's not in it all that much, Famke Janssen was good also and she has this knack for playing annoying women so perfectly, which is how I found Lenore to be in Taken...annoying and very naive, especially when it came to her daughter. The evil side of me wishes Mills would have said 'I told you' to Lenore at the end.Taken is definitely a film that should be on everyone's 'must see' list.",7,0,0,3 November 2015
Mama," Superb Psychological Horror
","Mama is the story about two girls who have inadvertently been left alone in the woods to fend for themselves. Five years on, they are miraculously found alive and are rescued by a search party organised by their uncle. Unfortunately, as time goes on, it is evident that someone - or something - had been looking after the two children and that that something has been brought back with them.This movie was excellent and it was just as good as I was hoping for. It started off really well, and kept a nice steady pace going throughout all the way through to the somewhat sad ending. It most definitely picks up in the last 40 minutes as well. I'll be honest and say that at one point, about halfway through, I thought it wasn't going to pickup or get much better than what it had up to then. Boy, was I wrong! Mama is a very creepy movie (yet at the same time quite sad as well) and the way the character of Mama was done was impressive. The movement for that character is reminiscent in parts to that of the 'ghosts' in Ju-on and Ringu which just adds to the creep factor for me. Also, the way the CGI was mixed with live actors for Mama was done really well, which makes me wonder what movie was being watched by people who complained about it being 'rubbish'. For a movie that had an estimated budget of only $15m it was anything but 'rubbish'.The performances were good all round, but the best by an absolute country mile were the two girls, Megan Charpentier (who played Victoria) and Isabelle NÃ©lisse (who played Lilly). They both brought a real believability to their characters with convincing performances showing two girls who, for five years, had to fend for themselves and then have to try and adjust to living in modern society.Like I said earlier, this is an excellent film and I think it's the best horror/chiller I've seen since Sinister. If you love psychological horrors then I highly recommended Mama.",8,2,4,14 January 2015
Sinister," Most Definitely Sinister
","This movie is exactly what the title says - Sinister. I really enjoy these types of horror/mystery/suspense movies and while I get drawn into a lot of them and love the tension & feeling I get, very few of them can easily creep me out. This one did, though, and I LOVED it.The movie has just got something about it that brings out the disturbed feeling in you. Whether it's the way it was filmed; the way the victims died; the glimpses you see of 'Mr Boogie' (name sounds cheesy but upon watching the movie you'll find that it's not); or just the general subject matter....I don't know and maybe it's a whole combination of the above (and more) that does it. All I do know is that it is creepy as hell.The first scene of the movie grips you right from the off and it doesn't really ease up either. There are some slower moments, but because you get drawn in you don't really feel it getting slow. It moves along at a good pace overall, and it keeps you watching while building up the suspense factor, and there are a good amount of genuinely creepy moments as well.I thoroughly recommended watching this movie at night, with the lights off and the sound up. A definite MUST watch.",8,1,2,24 September 2014
Inside Man," Not One Of Washington's Best
","I REALLY wanted to enjoy Inside Man, but unfortunately, in the end, I thought it was just an OK action thriller and really wasn't anything special. Good story, great cast (and that's coming from a guy who's not a big fan of Clive Owen), and good plot twists. What else could a film need right? Well, for me, it needed a wee bit of pace to it. Don't get me wrong...it didn't have to go at 100mph like a Die Hard film, but it just moved a bit too slow I thought and just dragged on a wee bit. Spike Lee films do have a tendency to be on the slower side and that didn't bother me with the likes of Clockers, for instance, which I thought was a great film but Inside Man, however, fell slightly short of the action mark for an action/thriller.The majority of the characters were pretty well done (even if some were your usual stereotypes for a Spike Lee movie), but the part of Madeleine White (played by Jodie Foster), when you think about it, really wasn't needed as she really added nothing to the film. Foster's character didn't do anything and it's like she was there just for the sake of being there.Also, as a wee side note, I'm extremely thankful that the role of Washington's wife wasn't in the movie a lot because I don't think I could have stomached all the 'hurry home, baby', 'oh yeh baby', 'love you baby', and the excruciatingly painful 'Big Willie' line more than what I had to.For me, it's the twists and turns that the story takes that keeps the film interesting, and there are a good few of them scattered throughout. The suspense that this all produces is good, but really nothing fantastic.Overall, Inside Man was a decent action/thriller to watch, but Heat it most definitely wasn't. Not bad, but have seen much better.",5,0,2,17 January 2015
Jack Reacher," Ignore The Hate And Watch It
","Jack Reacher is a movie about an ex-military cop (Reacher) who gets involved in a murder case when he sees the news about 5 random killings that have been committed by an ex-military sniper. Upon arriving at the D.A.'s office, however, he's slightly confused as he learns that the suspect has actually requested for Reacher to be brought in to help him. Reacher sets out to prove the suspect's guilt though, but as he does he starts to learn that there may be a lot more to the case than what first meets the eye.If you enjoy good old-fashioned cat-and-mouse action/thriller's then you won't go far wrong with Jack Reacher. The action in the movie is really very good, and quite often suspenseful, but it doesn't have as much as what I initially thought judging by the previews I saw. However, while that sounds like a complaint, it's not because this is a movie that doesn't have to rely on having non-stop action scenes in it to make up for a ridiculous or non-existent plot i.e. Fast And The Furious.If I did have one main complaint, it would be the end fight between Reacher and Charlie, but I guess I can overlook that as the storyline, while confusing if you're not paying attention, is generally really good and it's this, along with all the other action, that keeps the movie ticking along nicely.While the book die-hards will probably moan about the decision in having Cruise play the part of Jack Reacher (in the book Reacher's 6ft 5, 250lb), I think he pretty much nails it. Ever since the Mission: Impossible films Cruise has always managed to bring a believability to the action characters he's played, and he pulls off the fight/action scenes so well. Jai Courtney is also really good as Charlie, the main 'bad guy' who is so relentless & vicious you don't mind when bad things happen to him.All in all, Jack Reacher is a movie worth watching and I definitely recommend it.",7,2,4,10 December 2014
Rosemary's Baby," Decent Film But The Scare Value Is Massively Over-Hyped.
","Rosemary's Baby has been out now for 47 years and I finally decided to see what all the hype was about by recently watching it, and I must say that it is indeed not too bad of a movie. I actually had this pinned down as (probably) being one of the most over-hyped films ever made but it's actually a very decent and intriguing psychological thriller (this isn't a horror for me).Is it one of the best 'horror' films ever made? Not even close, and I do think the scare factor it's been given by people definitely is over-hyped, but like I say, it is a very decent film that is worth watching.It's also a pretty slow-paced movie, but because the story is told well and it holds your interest decently enough you don't really feel the lack of pace, and you do get drawn into it all. Story is obviously the main element here, and it's that, along with the acting & atmosphere, that keeps you watching.Speaking of acting...there are some moments where it's a bit dodgy or over-the-top, but this film was made in '68 so some of the performances will seem a touch melodramatic by today's standards. In saying that, however, I do think Mia Farrow gives a great performance as the sweet & innocent, yet somewhat naive, Rosemary.As I mentioned earlier, I think the scare factor hype has been amped way up and I always scratch my head in wonderment when people say they found it extremely scary/creepy as I personally never found it to be either of those. I guess it proves that different people find different things scary. I mean I know of people who have said The Exorcist isn't creepy/scary yet for me that film completely pacifies Rosemary's Baby. I wasn't expecting a 'boo!' or gory film, and a film doesn't have to have those elements to be scary for me, but while it was disappointing on that side, other aspects held my interest enough for me to enjoy it.Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it, especially if you enjoy films that cater more towards the psychological element.",6,1,1,12 September 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," A Very Enjoyable Sci Fi Ride
","After 5 years of war against an alien race called Mimics, the Allies finally win a victory and Sgt. Vrataski is hailed a hero after she single-handedly kills hundreds of Mimics. Thinking he's been brought in to use Vrataski's story to boost war efforts, Maj. William Cage (who has no combat experience) meets with Gen. Brigham, but is told he'll be providing coverage for the media at ground zero instead. After refusing & trying to escape, Cage is sent into combat where he's killed within minutes but not before taking out an Alpha Mimic. Cage suddenly awakens the day before his battle, and before long, realises he's caught in a mysterious time-loop. In time, he learns his only way out is to work with Vrataski, and with each re-run they learn what needs to be done to defeat the Mimics.This is another classic Cruise Sci-Fi movie and no matter what you think of him, he has a knack lately for starring in really enjoyable, exciting films. Edge of Tomorrow, while not perfect (what movie is?), is an excellent, edge of your seat Sci-Fi/Action film that definitely delivers on all fronts...action, suspense, and a touch of comedy.This film is huge and it's not hard to see where a lot of the estimated $178m budget went as the visual & special effects, along with the massive battle scenes, are absolutely fantastic. The story is pretty complex and you need to pay close attention to what is happening because if you don't you'll become lost pretty easily.There is a very obvious Groundhog Day element to part of the story with scenes even containing some pretty good moments of humour, especially parts involving the members of J-Squad, and just when you feel that the story it's starting to get TOO repetitive, it changes direction to keep your interest.The cast also do a fantastic job, especially Cruise and Blunt, who work on-screen well together. Edge of Tomorrow is top-notch and is a movie that is definitely worth watching.",7,3,5,19 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Great Final Installment To An Enjoyable Trilogy
","Having now watched this final installment of The Hobbit, I think it's safe to say that while this trilogy isn't as good as the Lord of the Rings, they're still excellent films in their own right. I've read The Hobbit but not Lord of the Rings (yet), so it's quite surprising how the makers managed to get three films from a short book, but overall I think they were really well done.The criticism I've read from people regarding this final installment - and even the whole series - has been ridiculous to say the least, from complaining that certain things weren't in the book to bad CGI. Bad CGI?! Seriously?? I must have watched a completely different film because the look of not just this film but the whole trilogy, from the locations, photography, and cinematography to the action and visual & special effects were nothing short of excellent and were just as good as the Lord Of The Rings. As for some things being in the film that weren't in the book...this is a film ADAPTATION. The Shining was absolutely nothing like the book yet that was praised. I know every one has their own tastes and opinions, but there's a difference between opinions and just trolling.The films may have been beefed out quite a bit, but at no point do they ever feel that they are just dragging along. For me, there's more than enough to keep your interest and to keep you watching with plenty of drama, tension, suspense, and action throughout. As with the previous films, there is the occasional silly action scene such as Legolas running along rocks that are falling in mid-air, but it's not as if these scenes ruin the films.There's also a nice wee tie-in to the Lord of the Rings with Legolas being told to seek out the ranger names Strider.All in all, this was a really enjoyable movie to round off The Hobbit trilogy, so if you've not seen it as yet (or the previous movies), then ignore the - sometimes over-the-top - hate and go and watch it. You may just be surprised by how good it is.",8,2,5,11 May 2015
The Conjuring," Not Too Bad At All
","Roger & Carolyn Perron, along with their 5 children, move to a new countryside home in Rhode Island but it's not long before things start going wrong. It all starts off with the usual doors closing & opening; pictures falling off the walls; creaking floorboards, but it's not long before things start taking a more sinister turn. Roger & Carolyn find help in the form of Lorraine and Ed Warren, two paranormal investigators who have investigated countless instances of paranormal behaviour, and working together they soon start to find out who - or what - is behind the events that is plaguing their home.The Conjuring is a pretty decent horror/suspense movie, but unfortunately it wasn't as good as I was hoping. To be honest, it's a little bit slow paced at times until roughly the last 20 minutes where everything gets pretty relentless and comes to a head. In saying that, though, it's never a boring movie and it has a good few scares with some pretty decent tension that gets built up quite nicely along the way.As mentioned earlier, the last 20 minutes is where the movie is at it's best and definitely makes up a wee bit for the other lacking parts of the film. The movie has two story's that criss-cross with each other. We have the main story of the escalating incidents with Roger & Carolyn and then there's the one that shows glimpses into Ed & Lorraine's lives as investigators. The stories entwine well with each other without getting confusing or muddled.This is definitely not on the same level as films like Insidious or Sinister, but if you enjoy other films like The Amityville Horror and A Haunting In Connecticut then you will probably enjoy The Conjuring.Overall, a pretty good movie to watch and I recommend giving it a go.",6,0,1,15 January 2015
Prometheus," An Enjoyable Indirect Prequel Spin off To Alien
","Despite what people say, Prometheus is NOT a direct prequel to Alien, and even though it has tie-in's to the 1979 Oscar® winning movie, it is actually it's own film dealing with it's own mythology. This isn't an Alien type of film either....well, not in the same sense as any of the previous movies, so if you're expecting that then you'll be disappointed.The story deals with the mythology of where mankind originated from and if we were 'engineered' from a much more advanced race. It's actually quite a slow going film times, but it never gets to the point of being boring, and even with these slower moments it's still well written that develops nicely and keeps your interest throughout.One main thing that was missing for me was the atmosphere & tension. In Alien, there was a fantastic claustrophobic feel that brought about a superb amount of suspense that kept you enthralled, but unfortunately that was lacking here somewhat.Prometheus is a visually stunning movie, from the opening scenes (which were filmed in Iceland & Scotland), to the space views and shots on LV-223. Everything is just filmed beautifully & seamlessly and the movie is deserving of it's Best Visual Effects nomination. What makes the effects even more impressive is that the CGI was kept to a minimum as Scott wanted to use as much practical effects as possible.The cast do a great job also with Charlize Theron as the ice-cold b*tch Meredith Vickers and Michael Fassbender as David. Fassbender plays his character so well that you can see there is always something going on underneath....he's always calculating and you can never tell if you can trust him or not. Just like Ash from Alien, in fact. Guy Pearce also does an excellent job as the elderly Peter Weyland. He's definitely come a LONG way since his soap opera days of Neighbours and Home & Away.This isn't the most exciting movie out there, but it still does a good job of entertaining you and I personally can't wait for the sequel.",6,0,0,3 March 2015
The Woman in Black," Another Below Average Supernatural Horror
","Woman in Black is another supernatural horror movie that looks far better in the trailers than what it actually is. Don't get me wrong, it's not an awful movie, but it's definitely nowhere near as good as what it is made out to be, and it was definitely a disappointment. It is a much slower-paced film as well, which I don't mind as long as there is enough to keep my interest, but there wasn't and it ended up feeling a bit like a chore just to get to the end.Like I said, it's not an awful film and it is watchable, but apart from the odd few jump scares, sudden screaming ghostly faces (which is really becoming a huge cliché now), and a pretty decent creepy atmosphere, there wasn't really anything noteworthy about this film. Yes, the story was there and some decent acting was there, but the film lacked any real tension, originality, and moved extremely slow. These days, a horror movie can only rely on the plus points I mentioned for so long before it gets kind of boring and tedious as it lacks imagination, and Woman in Black falls into that category. The clichéd scares mentioned can be good in a film, but not when that's all that's relied on to carry it.I did mention decent acting was here as well, but unfortunately not much of it came from Daniel Radcliffe as his performance overall was a bit wooden I thought. I don't mind Radcliffe at all (and I'm not afraid to admit that I enjoyed the Harry Potter films), but here his performance was just void of any real depth and was just a bit wooden, like I say.The story was OK (which is one you have to pay attention to as well as you can become lost if you don't), but it wasn't really one that gripped you, or left you sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation. Like all the other plus points, it was just OK.Woman in Black is watchable and I'd recommend it if you haven't got anything else better to see and want to while away an hour and a half. Just don't expect anything that great is all.",4,1,2,2 June 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Very Decent End To The Trilogy
","In this latest Batman movie, Bruce Wayne/Batman has been 'retired' ever since taking the blame for what happened 8 years prior. However, it doesn't take long for him to come back out of 'retirement' when the latest villain (Bain) turns up wanting to destroy Gotham City.Bale as Batman, while still quite annoying with his gravely voice (I feel he just tries to be too much like the deep voiced Keaton's Batman) still brings on a great performance. Anna Hathaway was decent as Catwoman, even if she was pretty irritating at times (and, to be honest, I never really had any sympathy for her 'poor little female victim' routine), and Tom Hardy as Bain was excellent as well (even if his accent was off-putting).Now, after reading the above criticisms, you may wonder why I gave it a decent rating. Well, what bumped it up to 4 stars for me was the jaw-dropping visuals, the relentless action (especially in the last hour, hour and a half), and the sheer scale of the movie. When watching The Dark Knight Rises you can really understand why it took a reportedly whopping $250m to make. This is definitely the biggest Batman movie to date, although it's not the best one I have seen as I think, overall, Batman and Batman Returns are the better films.The Dark Knight Rises definitely ranks up there, though, just behind the two I mentioned and The Dark Knight (Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker is what makes The Dark Knight so good for me). Batman fans will probably love this movie no matter what, but even if you're indifferent to the Batman franchise, The Dark Knight Rises is still definitely worth watching.",7,2,3,10 December 2014
The Croods," An Enjoyable Prehistoric Animation Romp
","The Croods are the last cave family in their 'neighbourhood' with the other families having been killed by one thing or another. This leads Grug Crood (Nicolas Cage) to be a bit over-protective with his family meaning that they hardly ever leave their cave and that anything new is bad. Eep Crood (Emma Stone) is more adventurous, though, and is constantly frustrated by her dad's over-bearing manner, so one night she leaves the safety of their cave to investigate a strange light. It's here that she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds)...an incentive young boy who predicts 'the end of the world'. After an earthquake destroys their cave, the Croods - along with Guy - leave to find pastures new, bringing about different dangers & adventures.The Croods is an enjoyable roller coaster animation ride, but unfortunately I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Don't get me wrong...it's still a very good movie, but it was just missing a certain something to make it better. DreamWorks have done better animated movies with Shrek and Turbo to name some, but that doesn't mean The Croods is bad.As we have come to see from a lot of DreamWorks movies, the animation is superb and is crystal clear, especially in Blu-ray. The humour is constant throughout the movie as well which is good because that's much better than an animated movies that only have two or three funny moments and then nothing else. The humour isn't 'roll about laughing' kind of humour, but it is enough to definitely make you laugh.One wee minor downside was that a couple of scenes did tend to drag on a bit with the 'chasing for food' opening scene being one of them. The casting was spot on as well and they all done a great job. None of the characters were annoying, and I actually think that Belt - Guy's pet sloth - is one of the best characters in the movie.The Croods isn't just a kids movie but is a family movie, and it doesn't matter if you're 6 or 60...this is a movie that everyone can like.Watch it and enjoy.",7,1,1,16 January 2015
Monsters University," Not As Good As Monsters, Inc, But Still Enjoyable
","In Monsters University, we join Mike & Sully again but this time it's before their Monsters, Inc days as this is a prequel that takes us through their school days and how they met. Young Mike Wazowski has a dream of becoming a Scarer at Monsters, Inc so he works his way through school to get to Monsters University and it's there he meets James P. Sullivan. Unfortunately they get along together like Tom & Jerry, but after making a deal with Dean Hardscrabble that he and his fraternity of loser friends can win the university's Scare Games he's forced to work alongside Sully when his group is short by one member. Will it be a continuance of butting heads, or Mike & Sully manage to put their differences aside to work together? This is yet another good Disney/Pixar animation, but unfortunately it's nowhere near one of the funniest. While there are slightly amusing parts dotted throughout the movie and it does have it's certain moments, there is a definite lack in the hilarity department. The animation, however, is top notch as always (and as we have come to expect), especially on Blu-ray, with the visuals being crystal clear and really well done.The voice casting is good as well with the return of John Goodman as Sully and Billy Crystal as Mike and even though I'm not a big fan of Billy Crystal as I think he's about as funny as a funeral, him and Goodman do work well together as the main characters. Steve Buscemi makes a return as Randall Boggs, and Helen Mirren is good as the hard, steely faced, and serious Dean Hardscrabble.As with Disney/Pixar as well, this movie is good for kids and adults of all ages and even though it has a G rating, there may possibly be two or three scenes that might just be a wee bit scary for the really younger children of the 4 or 5 age group, but overall it's a movie made to be enjoyed by everyone, young and old.Monsters University may not be as good as the slightly better Monsters, Inc but it's still a decent family movie to watch.",7,0,0,15 January 2015
Trainspotting," Hard-Hitting & Disgustingly Funny
","Disgusting. Disturbing. Funny. Emotional. Riveting. Breathtaking. Just a few words I'd use to describe Trainspotting.I first saw this movie when it was released way back in 1995, and I honestly didn't know what to make of it. After watching it again, almost 20 years later, I've come to the conclusion that it is indeed a true classic.Now, a good few people will think (and will try and tell you) that this movie glamourises drugs & crime. In brutal honesty, though, those people don't know what they are talking about because this movie does anything BUT glamourise that lifestyle. The only thing it 'glamourises' is the actual supposed high you get from taking these drugs, but that is fleeting because it quickly brings you down to earth with a massive bang. From showing you the squalor that these people live in for the majority of the time, the mishaps that they get into, and what happens to some of them, if this is 'glamourising' then I'd hate to see what a movie that is against drugs & crime is like.For me this movie tells you one basic message - if you take drugs and live a life of crime then this is what your life will end up being like. The acting and performances are nothing short of fantastic and the actors will make you feel less & less sympathetic (if you have any in the first place) towards any of their characters. Renton - very likable & you always hope that he beats his habit; Spud - again, is likable and you end up feeling sorry for him as he's just one of those lemming-type's of people that follows his 'friends'; Sickboy - just purely selfish and uncaring; Begbie - a really vicious b***ard, always looking for an excuse to fight, and you always hope he get's his comeuppance; Tommy - the sensible one of the bunch (or is he?).This is a really powerful movie, and is not really for the feint of heart as it's pretty disturbing (as well as gross) in a good few scenes. In saying that, though, it most definitely makes for compelling viewing.Definitely recommended.",9,2,4,24 September 2014
The Purge," Really Good Home Invasion Movie
","In the near future crime has fallen to an all-time low thanks to what is known as 'the purge' - a yearly one-off 12-hour period where the government has allowed all types of crime to be committed without fear of consequence. James & Mary Sandin, along with their son, Charlie, and daughter, Zoey, are preparing themselves for the purge when Charlie let's a potential murder victim into their house for refuge. However, the group who have been chasing the stranger gives James an ultimatum - give them the stranger or face the consequences. Torn between the choice of protecting his family and morality, James has to decide what to do - and doesn't have much time to do it.The Purge never had a really good write up by a lot of people but in all honesty I actually quite enjoyed it. It's nothing fantastic, but it delivers a good bit of tension & suspense with a couple of wee twists.The idea of crime being down to only 1% is a fantastic thought, but the idea that the film puts forward on how to get that 1% is very contentious. I mean it makes you think - would you be OK with crime being at an all-time low if there was only one specified period of the year where all services are non-responsive within that time and crime is non-punishable? The film kind of raises those morality issues. But even if you don't want to get 'that deep' into the movie, it's still good just to watch without too much thought.The characterisation in The Purge I think is done pretty well too. Ethan Hawke does a good job as James Sandin, a well-off businessman but isn't arrogant about it. The 'strangers' are annoying but they're meant to be with the leader being played well by Rhys Wakefield. You do find it quite hard drawing up any kind of sympathy for the Sandins' daughter, however, with her being the typical bratty 16/17-year-old.Anyway, The Purge is a decent film to watch. It's not Oscar winning but it's not meant to be. Definitely worth a watch.",7,0,1,15 January 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Thankfully MUCH Better Than The First Installment
","In some ways I was pretty reluctant in seeing this next installment of The Hunger Games film series because -1) the first film bored the ever-loving pants off me (a view I still stand by), so I wasn't sure if I would want to see the next film.2) I was intrigued to see what DID happen next.However, after seeing The Hunger Games: Catching Fire I was actually surprised and I'll hold my hands up and say that it IS actually a very good film. Like I said, the first film was boring and very over-hyped, but this time it went the opposite way.In saying that, though, it didn't start off that way as the first 40 minutes or so of this film was slow and I did actually think it was going to be worse than the first movie. Thankfully, it DID get better from about the hour mark, picking up in both pace & action. The acting wasn't anything special but it was believable and solid with good performances from Lawrence, Hoffman, and especially Harrelson.Some elements of the first film that I didn't like have returned for this installment, the main one being the ridiculous Alice in Wonderland type costumes. Whether it's like that in the books or not I don't know as I've not read them, but that still doesn't stop me from thinking that some of the costumes were completely out of place. Some of the costumes just made it seem that you were watching two different film genres, but this is confined to mainly the first 40 or so minutes so.Now, I'm definitely not a die-hard Hunger Games fan, but even I'll admit that it's getting very tiresome seeing the continual comparisons between this and the Battle Royale films. It was interesting to start with but I honestly wish people would just shut up about the comparisons because quite frankly it's becoming very tiresome & boring seeing it all the time. We all KNOW the films are similar, but enough is enough.Anyway, if, like me, you almost gave up the series after watching the first film, stick with it because this one is MUCH better.",7,1,9,27 July 2015
Godzilla," Absolutely Immense
","This has to be one of 2014s biggest & best Action/Sci-Fi movies, and it's so good to see a movie like this have it all - decent story, plenty of action, and superb visuals. Also, this is NOT a remake/sequel to the decent 1998 movie, and anyone who says it is needs to do a wee bit of research. It's a reboot of the original 1954 Godzilla movie, which actually gets tied-in with this film.Now, while that '98 film was good, and still is enjoyable, it's just too much along the lines of other Roland Emmerich popcorn movies...masses of CGI & visuals but thin on plot. This version, however, blows that one out the water and while it still is a CGI-fest, at least the story wasn't forgotten about like other CGI-fest movies i.e. Pacific Rim, Day After Tomorrow, and Independence Day.I LOVED Godzilla here and he's an absolute bad-ass, and while he's been kept to the basic original look of the '54 monster, he's been given a 2014 makeover at the same time. I love the look of Godzilla in the '98 version as well, but this version is far superior. The cast all do a bang-up job as well and there isn't one unlikeable character. The only thing is you do struggle to understand what Ken Watanabe - who plays Dr. Ishiro Serizawa - says sometimes, but other than that they all do a great job.Now, I've read reviews saying this film 'has no action' and 'was boring'. Seriously?! No action?! There's CONSTANT action throughout the movie so how people can say there's 'no action' is beyond baffling. I guess the story interrupted their enjoyment too many times. Anyway, the only downsides I had with this film was that it was too dark in some places so was hard to see what was happening - especially towards the end - and I would have liked to have seen Godzilla just a bit more throughout the movie. Those are really the only reasons why I gave this an 8 rating instead of a 9 or possibly a 10, but even still, this is a superb movie.Ignore the haters and judge it for yourself.

Looper," Vastly Overrated
","Looper is a movie that deals with time-travel, and is mainly about a group of people called 'Loopers', who are basically modern-day assassin's working for the mob. Everything is going well for one particular Looper (Joe) until something happens when one of his targets gets away, but that isn't the only problem because this particular target is Joe's future self.Now, story-wise this movie is pretty decent. It's a really good idea, but to be honest, it actually gets pretty confusing a lot of the time. I know that movies dealing with time travel CAN get confusing, but Looper just jumps around far too much, and if you're not paying attention to it right from the start you will get lost very easily, very quickly.The performances, however, are good, and Jeff Daniels actually plays a pretty decent mob boss. On paper you wouldn't have thought that he could have pulled off the part of playing a bad guy, but he does a surprisingly decent job of it. Bruce Willis is probably the best in the movie and if it wasn't for him, the movie may well have been worse.Looper, unfortunately, was just far too boring for me. It was 30 minutes of decent action & viewing but the other 1½ hours was pretty much just sheer boredom, waiting for it to pick up again. If it kept up a good pace with the story ticking over it would have been much better. I know that movies - especially ones like this - need wee 'breaks' in them so you can catch your breath so to speak, but there were just far too many times where you thought 'finally, it's picking up' for it to only just slow right down to a crawl again.Overall Looper is worth a watch - just - but in all honesty don't expect anything brilliant.",4,2,3,10 December 2014
Cube," Not Bad At All
","A handful of strangers wake up in a room, not knowing where they are or why they are there. They soon realise that they are trapped in some kind of cubed contraption where all joining rooms appear to be the same. They quickly find out, however, that all the rooms are not the same as some are booby trapped and some are not. Not knowing if they are there purely for someone's sick entertainment or if they are part of some kind of government experiment, they have to try and all work together to figure out what rooms are safe and how to get out alive.OK straight to the point here - if you don't like slower-paced movies or films where you have to think about things then don't even bother with this one as you will not like it. Also, if you're hoping that it's some kind of gore-filled Saw 'lookalike' then, again, you'll be disappointed.Cube is a pretty decent psychological sci-fi thriller and is actually an original and clever idea as this was done in the days long before movies like Saw and The Collector. As mentioned before, it is quite a slow-paced movie, but you don't really get bored when watching it because you get drawn into the story and it does tick along pretty nicely, gradually building up suspense as it goes along.Some of the traps in the movie are so simple but they work so well, especially the very first one you see in the opening scene, and some of the effects are really well done especially for such a low-budget film. The only real downside is that some of the acting from Maurice Dean Wint who plays Quentin is a little bit over the top, but it's not enough to really ruin the movie.Cube is yet more proof that a little low-budget independent movie can do just as good as the big blockbusters that cost hundreds of millions of $, if not sometimes better.A pretty decent film to watch.",5,0,0,16 January 2015
Minions," Despicable Me It's Not, But Enjoyable It Still Is
","I think movies like this are always going to be a bit of a risk. I guess there's a certain amount of risk to any film, but I think more-so with spin-offs. Usually I think to myself when I hear about films like this is 'How are they going to make a film entirely about side characters?'. I thought the same about Penguins of Madagascar. Penguins wasn't a brilliant film, but it was enjoyable and the makers done a good job of making a feature from 'bit part' characters. Well, I think the makers of Minions done a similarly good job here in making a feature about Gru's little henchmen as it's a pretty enjoyable movie.I liked the story line they worked with for the movie with it posing the questions 'Who are the Minions & how did the Minions come to be?'. They went with the Evolution angle, Minions style, showing them how they first came into existence, how they evolved over millions & millions of years, and how they only want to serve the ultimate villain. The story obviously expands as we fast-forward a good few millenia to 1968, where Bob, Stuart, & Kevin go off to search for their tribes newest ultimate villain (ultimately ending up with the obvious towards the end).Now, I personally enjoyed the film. It was pretty funny (though not hysterical), it was well animated, and the voice cast all done a good job. I liked the characters (especially the Nelson family), and the more subtle jokes that were shown e.g. the filming of the moon landing. Was it ultimately as good as the Despicable Me films? No, and I think the Minions will always be better as side characters, but this is still a good film in it's own right.Minions isn't a kids movie either...it's a family film, and I think it's a film that will be generally enjoyed by audiences of all ages. I'm almost 42 and I enjoyed it.Oh, as a side note to those who complained about how there's 'no black characters'. Grow up, don't be pathetic, and stop continually playing the race card. It's growing old.",7,0,0,26 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Absolutely Amazing Film
","Excuse me for just a moment while I act like a 13-year-old boy who's just seen Katy Perry flash her cleavage...OMG OMG OMG!!!! That was, like, so totally amazing!!!OK now that that's out the way, I can act like a more responsible adult again and give my opinion and review about Mad Max: Fury Road. First, I'd just like to say...OMG OMG OMG!!!! That was, like, so totally amazing!!!But seriously, this honestly has to be one of the biggest and most amazing Action films I have seen for quite a while...possibly even ever. The whole film, from start to finish, comes at you like a speeding Doof Wagon, and it just never lets up.It's 100% relentless.I never actually thought that a pure Action film, which could be delivered so fast, so loud, and hardly ever stop, could be so damn good.Now, the story is a wee bit thin and not very original, but you know (or should know) you're not going to get a deep, profound storyline with a pure adrenaline-filled Action film such as this. You get exactly what you pay for...action, and plenty of it.As well as the action, the whole look of the film, from the editing & the cinematography to the stunts & visuals, were all superbly done, and all on a massive scale too. The close-to-the-surface filming is all still here, and there are some nice homages to the previous Mad Max films as well...the skull with a pilot's cap & goggles on a spike at the front of Nux's car; the music box one of the wives carries; and the metallic brace Max wears.The performances by the cast are all excellent as well, especially Tom Hardy as Max, Charlize Theron as Furiosa, Nicholas Hoult as Hux, and Hugh Keays-Byrne (who also played Toecutter in the original Mad Max) as Immortan Joe. Even the actors who made up the rest of Immortan Joe's War Boys done a fantastic job.I honestly cannot praise this film enough, and if you have not seen it then what are you waiting for?! Stop reading, and start watching. You won't regret it.",9,2,8,13 November 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," Just As Good As The First
","Getting used to his new life (but still unsure of his past), Jason Bourne has been set-up for a mission that he did not do, so is drawn back into the undercover spy world.Not many sequel's equal or better their previous movie's but this one does and is just as good a movie as The Bourne Identity. It's a faster paced film than the prequel, so you really do need to pay attention to follow what is fully going on (just like the first film) and it still combines action and story really well.This is a pretty short review, but I think the film does all the talking needed.An enjoyable movie and very much recommended.",7,0,1,21 September 2014
