Deja Vu," Amazing and exciting!!!
","It is really a great movie, with excellent plot and marvelous actors! Denzel Washington as for me is the best Afroamerican actor!!! In the beginning I didn't want to see this movie, it hadn't gotten a success in Russia and I thought that it would be boring and uninteresting cheap action but my friends told me THE TRUTH and i am not sorry that I have watched it! The problems in the movie, I think, are very actual nowadays, and 'deja vu' really forces to think about them. So I call everybody: if you want to see a wonderful, but not easy to understanding movie, you must go to your nearest cinema and watch 'deja vu'. Maybe you will say after viewing: 'I have a feeling that I watched this film earlier. It's like... deja vu.'",9,0,1,22 December 2006
Transformers," The Cartoon on the big screen
","Firstly, I'd like to tell u that I'm Russian so it's difficult to me to write my thoughts in English, but I'll try. When I saw the poster of 'Transformers' I thought:'Wow! The most favourite cartoon of my childhood is on the big screen! Nostalgia!' I must tell u that this American cartoon couldn't been shown in USSR in 80s, so firstly it was showed in 1994, when I was 4. So this interesting colorful cartoon became very popular in Russia and I was its fun too, as many Russian children. I had every series of the cartoon, I had some toy transformers and posters of them. But I didn't know then that this cartoon would 'transform' into full-fledged movie. Now my dream is reality. Michael Bay is very talented director so I expected something very big. Unfortunately it hasn't followed my through. Good things in the movie are firstly sound effects and video effects. They are perfect, I can't say more. The humor. I laughed during this film more than during many good comedies. Crazy small Nokia-robot is simply super. The humor makes more attractive fights and battles. Another good thing is actors especially Megan Fox. This girl is very beautiful, even only this force u to watch this movie again and again. Shia is, in my humble opinion, too simple and weak for the main role. These are all good things. But there are many bad things. For example, the script. Two crazy groups of aliens firstly are searching for the old glasses then for the strange cube. What a blather for high-quality film. It's funny but not interesting! And nearly during the half of the movie many pieces of metal are fighting and fighting and Great American Army cannot do anything! Robots have made well but they haven't their own tempers like it was in the cartoon. They are like godzillas or stupid king-kongs but not the living race. Also the movie advertise too much for example Nokia or GMC. So, my opinion is that is not a bad film, Michael Bay cannot do bad films, but I wanted more and I think old cartoon is better.",6,1,3,17 July 2007
