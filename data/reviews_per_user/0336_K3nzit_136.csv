","A very charming movie that delivers visually and acting-wise, but the story itself is not that interesting.",8,0,0,3 January 2020
The Lobster," An odd, yet interesting little movie

Moneyball," Pitt's acting is absolutely brilliant...
",Pitt's acting is absolutely brilliant and the movie itself is very well done. Based on a fascinating true story.,8,1,1,3 January 2020
The Avengers," For all audiences
","Entertaining, but lacks depth. I like my superhero movies a bit more darker and maturer. This has too many cheap jokes for my taste.",6,1,2,4 January 2020
Vertigo," Not very exiting
","I know Vertigo is considered as one of best Hitchcock movies, but it's also my least favorite of his work. The plot is slow and didn't excite me, plus Stewart and Novak weren't believable as lovers. Novak was way too young for the part.",5,1,6,28 December 2019
Black Swan," Chilling thriller
","An original and chilling thriller by Darren Aronofsky, who never ceases to amaze me. He truly is a visionary director and I hope he gets his first Oscar nomination for this one. Great job by Portman aswell, as it may be her best performance to date.Note: Written in 2010",9,1,1,3 January 2020
Sucker Punch," Somewhat underrated
","Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) mixes styles and takes elements from other movies to give us a very cool action-fantasy thriller that is 'Sucker Punch'. The dialogue is very weak, but still somewhat underrated movie that shows that geek culture is not always understood by the critics nor most moviegoers.",7,1,1,3 January 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Tremendously suspenseful...
","Tremendously suspenseful - 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the best movies of 2016. Not a home-run, because of the final act, but everything else is just so good. Like John Goodman, who shows why he is one of the best actors alive.",8,0,0,4 January 2020
The Hangover," It didn't need a sequel
","Some funny scenes here and there, but nothing special really. The humor is cheap and the acting bad all around. It didn't need a sequel.",3,1,2,28 December 2019
Wayne's World," Charming
","'Wayne's World' has maybe two of the funniest and most lovable main characters ever created. A comedy that is totally fearless, charming and full of memorable scenes and quotes. The sequel is equally entertaining!",8,1,2,28 December 2019
Star Trek," Entertaining

Fury," Definitely worth a watch...

Akira," A bit confusing
",Visually innovative and ahead of its time. But I could not live into the story and the ending left me a bit confused. Must watch again some day.,6,1,2,3 January 2020
Citizen Kane," American classic
","A very smart movie that is a great American classic, but it felt a bit too long and drawn out.",7,0,0,28 December 2019
Darkest Hour," Expected more
","It's remarkable how one man alone can carry a whole movie on his shoulders. Not that the movie was bad, the history just wasn't told in a very interesting way.",7,0,1,12 January 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Expensive Star Wars fan-film
","Not that I didn't enjoy the last few minutes, but it wasn't the story I wanted. Basically an expensive Star Wars fan-film when you think about it.",5,1,6,4 January 2020
Iron Man 2," Sometimes less is more!
",This action-packed sequel lacks the heart and soul of the original version. Too many unnecessary characters and action scenes for my taste. Sometimes less is more!,5,0,2,28 December 2019
Passengers," Could have been great in right hands
","The premise of the movie is interesting, but they decided to go big instead. Sad really, because it could have been a new sci-fi masterpiece in right hands.",5,2,4,4 January 2020
The Hunger Games," Didn't live up to the hype
",It's the performance by Jennifer Lawrence and the apocalyptic theme that make the movie rise a bit above the ordinary. But it didn't live up to the hype for me.,6,1,2,4 January 2020
The English Patient," I can't help to compare this movie to 'Titanic'...
","I can't help to compare this movie to 'Titanic', released a year after. Both huge Oscar winners and kind of similar in terms of story. But 'The English Patient' is so much more mature and intelligent - A better film by far.",8,1,1,3 January 2020
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Smart, funny and sweet
","Smart, funny and sweet - Way better than I expected!",8,3,4,3 January 2020
The Danish Girl," Glad she won the Oscar
",Would not have been as emotional without the performance by Alicia Vikander. It is she who makes this movie memorable for me and all teary-eyed at the very end. I'm glad she won the Oscar for it.,8,1,4,6 January 2020
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Suprisingly entertaining
","I never thought i say it, but man, that is a pretty good Bruckheimer movie. It's entertaining and has a very nice visual style, like the games it is based on. Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco, Mona Lisa Smile) has done a great job directing this movie.",7,0,0,28 December 2019
Oldboy," Unique and twisted
",Unique and twisted Korean masterpiece that will blow your mind.,10,1,1,28 December 2019
The Irishman," Forgettable
","It's almost breaking my heart when I say this, that it's a pretty forgettable gangster flick by the legendary Martin Scorsese. Fist off, the run-time of the movie feels really long and that's never a good sign. Secondly, the 'de-ageing' gimmick is just too irritating - The technology is just not here jet. Finally, the actors where too old to pull it off. It really feels that this film is made 20 years too late. Watch 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' instead if you haven't seen them.",6,3,6,13 April 2020
127 Hours," James Franco's part of a lifetime
","'127 Hours' is a small movie about an inspiring true story directed by Danny Boyle ('The Beach', 'Slumdog Millionaire'). In the lead role is James Franco who finally gets a part he deserves. And when the movie was over I felt Boyle could have used him even more!",7,1,1,3 January 2020
Pirate Radio," Meh
",A two hour long feel-good movie that isn't especially clever or funny.,5,0,3,3 January 2020
Creed," Nothing feels rushed

Midnight in Paris," Feel-good movies don't come any better than this.
",Feel-good movies don't come any better than this. Love the cameos by the historical figures.,9,0,0,4 January 2020
A Bridge Too Far," Overrated
",Too many stars and separate stories in one movie - Overrated.,5,1,1,28 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," Bravo!
","I love single location movies. The character development is usually really good in them. 'The Hateful Eight' has maybe one or two characters too many for it's own good, but it doesn't bring down the rating that much. I always except high quality stuff when it comes to Tarantino, but it still surprised me just how suspenseful the movie was - Bravo!",9,0,3,4 January 2020
"I, Tonya"," Too flashy
",The movie was just okay. Not really my kind of storytelling - All flash and not that much of substance. Would have worked better as full-on drama.,6,2,4,13 January 2020
Pan's Labyrinth," Visually stunning, but overrated
","'Pan's Labyrinth' - Easily one the most overrated movies of all time. I think people are over-analyzing this one. The story is actually so thin, that there's almost no story at all. And it didn't help that the main character was poorly acted. Hat's off for Sergi López for giving me something positive to take away from this experience. Although I must admit that it's a visually stunning movie.",3,5,10,3 January 2020
Horrible Bosses," Talented cast
","Quite watchable, thanks to its comically talented cast.6 out of 10",6,1,2,3 January 2020
Black Mass," Interesting and well acted...
",Interesting and well acted gangster movie based on true events. Unfortunately the character development is really bad. Witch is really hard to do with so many characters in limited screen-time. Would have worked better as a Netflix series in my opinion.,6,1,1,4 January 2020
The Best Years of Our Lives," A classic
","The best coming home from war film that has ever been made. The dialog, acting and cinematography are all excellent - A classic that will touch you and always stay with you.",10,2,2,28 December 2019
The Town," Entertaining
","Ben Affleck makes jet another good crime movie set in his hometown Boston. This one has many similarities to the movie 'Heat'. Even if not close as good, it's still a very entertaining piece of work.",7,0,0,3 January 2020
Suicide Squad," Narrative mess
","If you thought Batman v Superman was a narrative mess, then you are not going to enjoy this!",1,1,2,4 January 2020
Doctor Strange," Not the strongest origin story...
","Not the strongest origin story in the MCU, maybe because Stephen Strange in not one of the most likable characters in the franchise. The villain played by Mads Mikkelsen is interesting, but does not get the screen time it deserves - a problem that many Marvel flicks share. I would still say that the movie delivers in most departments. Special effects are spectacular, if not groundbreaking. Dialog is well written, the action sequences fun and the pace of the movie keeps the audience interested throughout. I must also give extra credit for Marvel Studios for using the beautiful filming locations in Nepal. Looking forward to the future adventures of Doctor Strange, now that the origin story is out of the way.",7,1,1,4 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," 'The Last Jedi' did too much damage
",A big thanks to Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley for getting me trough this new trilogy. Not that it felt like a trilogy or a complete story arc. 'The Last Jedi' did just too much damage for anyone to fix it. But hiring the guy who wrote the screenplay for Batman v Superman wasn't helping either.,4,38,65,7 January 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," A disappointment...
","A disappointment, but not a total disaster. Liked Hugo Weaving as the villain, but he had not much to do.",6,0,0,3 January 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," What a huge disappointment
","As a big fan of Freddie Mercury and Queen, this movie let me down in a big way. You couldn't do a more boring movie about a band with the most colorful lead singer of all time. I was hoping for a lot more depth to the characters and a much more raw take on the history. I'm also one of few people who thought that Rami Malek's performance was really annoying.",3,2,3,13 April 2020
Baby Driver," Style over substance
","Not the smartest action movie I have seen, but entertaining and stylish.",7,0,1,4 January 2020
The Caine Mutiny," Humphrey Bogart's best performance
",This must have been Humphrey Bogart's best performance of his career. He totally owned this movie. But 'The Caine Mutiny' would have been even better if they had left out the love story.,8,0,0,3 January 2020
The Revenant," Visually stunning
","Not only visually stunning movie, the acting and story pull you in right from the start. Slows down maybe a bit too many times, but a unique experience nevertheless.",7,0,1,4 January 2020
Split," What a comeback...
","What a comeback by the director/screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan. If you like the early movies of his career you got to check out Split - It's thrilling, smart and well-acted. Just be patient, the movie takes it's time, but it pays off in the end, trust me!",6,0,0,4 January 2020
American Psycho," Unique piece of art
",Christian Bales performance is mind-blowingly good and the mood unique and hypnotizing. I truly recommend this!,9,2,2,28 December 2019
North by Northwest," Stylish classic by Hitchcock
",Very entertaining and stylish classic by Hitchcock. North by Northwest has one of the most memorable scenes in the history of film. This is one of many reasons why every movie lover must see this picture.,8,0,1,2 January 2020
Salt," Good action/thriller
","Salt reminds me of Jason Bourne movies. And I must say that I liked it more than any of them. Non-stop intense action made Salt a more exiting experience. Another similar movie is The Fugitive, witch is better in the way that you really want the character to make it. But in Salt you really don't care that much about the main character. It's still a good action/thriller, but it's just nothing we haven't seen before.",6,5,6,28 December 2019
Duck Soup," Horribly dated
","One of the most horribly dated and ridiculous movies I have ever seen. Every single character is irritating and the story is so bad that it isn't even funny. I love Chaplin and Keaton, but this film is just totally tasteless in every sense of the word. I just can't stand the self-satisfied attitude the Marx Brothers have. And that Harpo guy is definitely the most annoying character I've ever seen in my life.",1,2,8,2 January 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," No other director could have pulled it off

","Great acting & good story. No masterpiece, but I enjoyed it a lot.",7,1,2,4 January 2020
Ratatouille," One of Pixar's best!
","There are some movies by other companies that have that special Pixar charm, but you can't beat a 'real' Pixar movie made by the right people. Ratatouille is not only one of 2007's best films, it's also one of Pixar's best. It is beautiful to look at and has a good message behind it as-well.",9,0,0,5 January 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Pays off if you have seen all the previous entries in the MCU

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fun!
",It's actually really good fun. Although I felt near the end that it had too many fight scenes in it for its own good.,8,0,1,28 December 2019
Quantum of Solace," Casino Royale: Part II
","'Quantum of Solace', or 'Casino Royale: Part II' as I like to call it, because it takes place only a few minutes after the ending of the last 007 movie. That is why I truly recommend to watch them as one big movie. Also because this one is not really that good on its own. The bad acting by Olga Kurylenko takes the rating down a bit as well. But as said - great if you watch it right after 'Casino Royale'.",7,1,3,28 December 2019
Gone with the Wind," One of the best Hollywood productions
","Even though 'Gone With the Wind' has many years on its neck, it's still one of the best Hollywood productions. Vivien Leight does a absolutely fabulous job here and Clark Gable is brilliant aswell. Just make sure you are prepared for the long run time when you start watching it - two sittings are required.",10,1,2,28 December 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A huge disappointment
","I thought the story lost all of its momentum after the good start and the character development was just terrible. The stunts were pretty good, but they didn't always push the story forward. I must say I liked M:I-2 and M:I-3 more than this one.",5,0,4,3 January 2020
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Good story, acting and visuals
","I had no big expectations on this one, because I'm not a fan of the previous films. But it surprised me with its story, acting and visuals. The CGI character Caesar was particularly impressive to look at when it came out.",7,0,0,4 January 2020
JFK," Masterpiece in many levels
","In my opinion one of the most important movies that has come out of Hollywood. From the multidimensional story to the top class acting by Costner and Oldman, it's a masterpiece in many levels.",9,3,3,28 December 2019
Django Unchained," Leaves a big grin on your face
","Has everything you'd expect in a Tarantino movie - Great dialogue, acting and visuals. He balances the serious theme and the dark humor in such a brilliant and entertaining way it leaves a big grin to your face days after you've seen the movie - A must-see!",10,1,3,4 January 2020
Get Out," Fresh take on the psychological horror genre
",Fresh take on the psychological horror genre. Looking forward to seeing future Jordan Peele projects.,7,1,3,4 January 2020
Drive," What's not to like?
","Kind of a cross between a Tarantino and a Fincher movie - What's not to like? If you liked this movie, I also recommend checking out 'The Driver' (1978)",9,3,5,3 January 2020
The Theory of Everything," Brilliant performances
",The absolutely brilliant performances by Redmayne and Jones save this romantic drama based on the memoir by Jane Hawking from being mediocre - I definitely enjoyed it more than I thought I would.,7,0,0,11 January 2020
2012," Waste of time
","A movie that had its moments visually, but ended up being a total waste of time. Possibly the worst screenplay ever written. Even the acting was bad, but seriously, no actor in the world could have made this movie work.",1,1,2,28 December 2019
The Lives of Others," It is as important as it is entertaining
","This German drama is perfect on so many levels, that I was left speechless at the end. Not many movies do that to me. The fact that I was born in Eastern Bloc helped to make the experience even more special. 'The Lives of Others' is a movie that is as important as it is entertaining - So watch it!",10,0,0,3 January 2020
Stardust," Glad I saw this it
","Glad I saw this one. Although it's a bit childish, it's surprisingly entertaining - Especially the ending.",6,0,0,28 December 2019
The Bourne Legacy," Best Bourne-movie
",I personally think that the Bourne-trilogy was way overrated. But this I like - A fresh take. It pulled me in right from the beginning.,6,2,2,4 January 2020
Dog Day Afternoon," Performance by John Cazale was one of few highlights
",One of the most overrated movies of the 1970's. Dog Day Afternoon is too deep for its own good. The long dialogues did not help to make it a very entertaining experience. Neither did it felt believable - even thought it is based on the true story. The performance by John Cazale was one of few highlights.,5,0,1,2 January 2020
Amadeus," Tom Hulce is brilliant
",Hats off for Tom Hulce for helping me to get through this three hours long period drama. His performance alone is a good reason to see the eight-time Oscar winner 'Amadeus'.,7,0,1,28 December 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Beautiful coming-of-age story
",Some directors really know how to create a distinct mood and Luca Guadagnino seems to know how to do that. He has made a movie that feels incredibly authentic and this is is largely due to the brilliant acting by the whole cast.,8,1,2,18 April 2020
Back to the Future Part III," My favorite
",My favorite of the trilogy. It has more heart and humor in it than the other two combined.,7,0,1,28 December 2019
Patton," George C. Scott is absolutely amazing
",George C. Scott is absolutely amazing in this World War II classic that won 7 Oscars in 1971.,9,0,0,3 January 2020
1917," One of the best war movies
","'1917' brings something new to the table as far as war movies go. Its gripping story is filmed in a very interesting way that really elevates the viewing experience and the cinematography really deserved the Oscar it got. The score by Thomas Newman is masterful as-well - Already a classic in my book. There are also plenty of epic scenes that stick with you long after the credits roll. With all that said it's not a perfect movie. I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat the whole way trough, like I thought I would. Maybe a few slow parts too many for my taste, but it was never boring like some people say. It's still one of the best war movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of them. Really glad there is still some quality movies coming out of Hollywood these days.",8,1,5,13 April 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rapace is brilliant
","I finally decided to sit down and watch the first part of the hyped 'Millennium' trilogy..and I'm glad I did. It turned out to be a surprisingly good thriller. A masterpiece compared to all the other thrillers produced in Sweden for the past ten years. They are the main reason why I've avoided this movie for so long. 'Män som hatar kvinnor' (Swedish title - literally means 'Men who hate women') has a good story. It's not that original, but it works. Also, the scenery is nice (Hollywood remake will also be filmed in Sweden). But the two main actors (Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist) are the main reason why I loved that movie so much. (They both got big Hollywood gigs after the success of this trilogy). Rapace is particularly convincing as the hacker.Note: Written in 2010",7,0,0,3 January 2020
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The story had some potential...

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Destroys the mythology
","I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think Lucas had made a better job with the sequels. Well at least he knows the mythology - this pretty much destroys it.",2,14,24,4 January 2020
The Big Blue," Highly overrated
","I needed a lot of coffee to stay awake through this long, slow paced movie by Luc Besson. What I took with me from this experience was the good performance by Jean-Marc Barr as a dive addict. But the character played by Jean Reno and the world championship in diving scenes where both totally unbelievable and silly. A huge contrast to the rest of the film's serious theme. The Big Blue is visually beutiful, but a highly overrated movie if you ask me.",5,1,2,28 December 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," Pretty unique
",An interesting and pretty unique romantic sci-fi thriller. Good performances by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt - They had good chemistry together.,7,0,1,3 January 2020
The Hangover Part II," 1 Star
","A sequel, but basically a remake, so why even bother.",1,1,3,3 January 2020
Logan," A good sendoff
","Finally a X-Men/Wolverine movie with heart. More of a stand-alone really, disconnected from the previous ones - which is a good thing. Second half is a bit uneven and not as memorable as the first, but overall a good sendoff for the Logan character played by Hugh Jackman.",7,1,1,4 January 2020
Friends with Benefits," Somehow it works
","Surprisingly good rom-com with Timberlake and Kunis. Although it's as predictable as most romantic comedies, the cast somehow managed to make it all work in a very delightful way.",7,0,0,3 January 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," Great comedy
","The more you know about the history of British rock bands - The more you will like this movie. I'm sure I missed some references/jokes, but the performances by Michael McKean and Christopher Guest alone are a reason to watch this movie.",7,0,0,28 December 2019
Super 8," Lacks soul
","J.J. Abrams goes all retro on us and tries to imitate Spielberg, but succeeds only visually.",5,1,2,3 January 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Slow burner
","'Life Is Beautiful' was a real slow burner for me. The first half of the movie was pretty boring, even a bit irritating at times. But as soon as it turned into a tragicomedy, it was pretty much flawless to the end (and the ending really got to me).",7,0,3,28 December 2019
Snowden," Unnecessary, but good

The King," The King of Netflix movies
","My god, what a well made Netflix film - Enjoyed every second of it. Based loosely on the works of Shakespeare, 'The King' has both drama and nail-biting action. It stars Timothée Chalamet who really deserved a Oscar nomination for his performance, but the supporting cast where brilliant as-well.",9,2,3,16 April 2020
Groundhog Day," One of the best comedies ever made
","Besides the humor and dialogue, I really love the warmth and charm this movie has. Bill Murray gives a really memorable performance here and the supporting cast do their jobs well aswell. A childhood favorite and I still think it is one of the best comedies ever made.",9,2,3,28 December 2019

Die Hard," One of the best action movies of the 80's

There Will Be Blood," Must See
","This movie is brilliant in so many levels. From the mood setting soundtracks by Jonny Greenwood, Johannes Brahms & Arvo PÃ¤rt.

A study of greed that is a 'Must See' for every movie lover.",10,3,4,28 December 2019
Downfall," Absolutely amazing

The Last King of Scotland," Great movie!
",Forest Whitaker's performance is not the only reason to watch this movie. What surprised me the most was how well the story arc of James McAvoy's character was told. Its what keeps the movie together.,8,0,1,3 January 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not that good
","Yes, it's a love letter to post-war Hollywood. But that doesn't make 'Hail, Caesar!' a good movie. The scenes are disconnected and overall story arc weak to say the least. Acting is very uneven here. Ehrenreich is great as the singing Western film star. Brolin is good as the 'fixer'. Clooney is passable as the studio's big star. Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ralph Fiennes have all brief appearances, with Fiennes's performence the only one standing out. Not the movie I would recommend, it's better to watch/re-watch one of the previous Coen brothers movies like 'Inside Llewyn Davis' (2013), 'No Country for Old Men' (2007), 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' (2000), 'The Big Lebowski' (1998) or 'Fargo' (1996).",4,2,3,4 January 2020

Blow," Interesting, intelligent and thoughtful
","Fascinating true story about drug dealer George Jung played by Johnny Depp. Blow is interesting, intelligent and thoughtful, everything that a similar movie 'Scarface' is not.",7,0,0,3 January 2020
The Woman in Black," Good acting
","The acting is good by Radcliffe and company, but that's pretty much all that is good.",3,1,1,4 January 2020
X-Men: First Class," Origin story
","An X-Men origin story that is surprisingly respectful to the original trilogy. I was not blown away by the action and visuals in this movie either, but the story was good and the acting even better. Fassbender and McAvoy were great, they really made the movie for me.",7,0,0,3 January 2020
Black Panther," Good world-building...
","Good world-building and character development in this entry to the MCU, including a morally complex villain. The biggest negative here is the uneven use of CGI.",7,0,4,4 January 2020
Casino Royale," Maybe the best Bond...
","A great thriller and maybe the best Bond movie of them all. The story is smart and the acting brilliant. The ending may seem a bit odd, but not if you watch the sequel 'Quantum of Solace' right after this one.",8,1,4,28 December 2019
La Vie En Rose," Take the time and enjoy her performance!
","The film feels too long and melodramatic, but Marion Cotillard's performance is so brilliant that it doesn't even matter.",8,0,0,6 January 2020
Before Sunrise," Realistic dialogue and strong chemistry
","I really loved to hang around with these two characters, brilliantly played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Their dialogue is so realistic and the chemistry is very strong between them. This really makes the movie stand out from others in the genre. A very special experience indeed.",10,0,0,3 January 2020
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Great dialogue and acting
",I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's surprisingly entertaining all the way through and all the main actors are really good in it. Great dialogue as well.,8,0,0,6 January 2020
The Matrix," Special
",The Wachowski brothers borrow cool stuff from all over - just like Tarantino does to make it a visually magnificent movie. But 'The Matrix' is much more than just special effects. They too know how to put together interesting characters and story. And the story of this movie is really clever - That's why 'The Matrix' is so special.,10,0,0,28 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Magical
","There is something magical about this first Star Wars movie. The simplicity of the story and the presence of Alec Guinness might have something to do with it. But what ever it is, George Lucas has created a universe so rich that people around the world have still not got enough of it 36 years later.",10,0,1,28 December 2019
Cloud Atlas," Experimental
","'Cloud Atlas' has got some of the most interesting experimental storytelling that I've seen to date. Maybe not the smartest film, but it's definitely one of the most fascinating. We will probably never again see a movie with a story that feels as epic as this one in our lifetime.",8,0,1,4 January 2020
Thirteen Days," Steven Culp's performece - Wow!
","Very good political thriller by Roger Donaldson. One of the highlights was Steven Culp's portrayal of Bobby Kennedy. It was so good, they should have at least given him an Oscar nomination!",8,0,1,3 January 2020
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," One of very few vampire flicks that I like
","Its not only because of the performances by Cruise, Pitt and Dunst I like this movie. But also because it had really good story and narrative.A solid 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,3 January 2020
Moon," One of my all-time favorites
","One of my all-time favorites. I love science fiction, but this movie works in so many levels that it will bring up different emotions every time I watch it. It's also crafted in such a perfect way that I would never get tired of watching it over and over again. There is just so much to enjoy here. From Sam Rockwell's brilliant acting to the mood setting soundtrack and its wonderfully detailed sets. And again, the thought provoking, multi-layered story that always leaves me in a different state of mind afterwards.",10,2,2,28 December 2019
True Romance," Shame that Tarantino wasn't directing
","'True Romance' has a well written story by Quentin Tarantino. But it's a real shame he was not behind the camera, because the movie is a bit too uneven for me to give it a higher rating. There is some memorable scenes here, but it also has one of the most irritating soundtracks in film history.",7,0,3,3 January 2020
The Social Network," Mediocre
",Mediocre for a David Fincher directed and Aaron Sorkin written movie.,6,2,3,3 January 2020
Back to the Future," Hasn't aged well
","Even though it's a fun ride, I can't say I'm a huge fan of it. Had I seen it as a kid the nostalgia would probably carried into today and I would appreciate it more. But the fact is that it hasn't aged as well as some other 80's movies. It's manly the slapstick elements that don't hold up in my opinion. But I still liked Fox and Lloyd as Marty and Doc and the time travel concept is fun as always.",6,2,3,28 December 2019
Sully," Can't go wrong with this one
","Well made movie based on real life events. No masterpiece, but so well put together and acted that you can't go wrong with this one.",7,1,1,4 January 2020
Alien: Covenant," Not bad, but a disappointment
","It's sad that Ridley Scott listened too much to the criticism after Prometheus. Instead of taking a step back, he could have made a more unique movie giving us a proper sequel with more answers along the way - Not bad, but a disappointment.",6,0,2,4 January 2020
All the President's Men," Hoffman and Redford are outstanding
","All the President's Men is an interesting film, but unfortunately not exciting enough. Still, Hoffman and Redford are outstanding and because it's about the Watergate scandal, it is still very much worth seeing.",6,0,0,2 January 2020
The Martian," Pretty boring
","Probably the most overrated movie of 2015. If you want to watch a similar movie about a person stuck in space go watch 'Moon' from 2009. The visuals are as good and the story is 10 times better, even acting. I'm not saying Ridley Scott is a bad director and Matt Damon a bad actor, the story here is just not that interesting, that's all.",5,1,1,4 January 2020
The Fighter," Unoriginal
",An unoriginal textbook Hollywood drama filled with all sorts of unlikable characters. Christian Bale's performance is the only thing that's good about this poorly directed movie.,2,0,2,3 January 2020
Evil Dead II," Much better than the first one
",I must say I was very impressed by this 1987's horror/comedy. Loved the effects and the humor. Bruce Campbell was just perfect as Ash and I liked it much more than the first one.,6,0,0,28 December 2019
From Here to Eternity," Impressed by Frank Sinatra's performance
",'From Here to Eternity' was way better than I expected. The story and acting were both very good. I was particularly impressed by Frank Sinatra's performance. I did not know he was so good at acting on big screen.,8,0,0,2 January 2020
The Godfather," Masterpiece
","This Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is perfect in so many levels that it's hard to put it into words. It is such a great character study and the performances by Brando, Pacino and Duvall help make it the classic that it is.",10,0,1,28 December 2019
