The Double Life of Véronique," Parallel lives ideally bound together.
","Parallel lives ideally bound together by some banal photographic clicks doomed to shake the soul and to generate a visual vortex determined by the perception of an impalpable, aleatory mystery, maybe some anomalous violence within the limits of a distortion in the space time continuum. Strange consonances, mutual echoes of existences fastened to invisible threads that join together and keep apart. Subterranean feelings of overwhelming voids lived like sudden and unexpected moments of melancholy wrapped in mystery. Hands leaned against the bark of the trees in order to penetrate the arcane vibrations of the nature and to trace the broken thread that join us to a parallel existence swept away forever, whose fleeting trace can be seen on a creased sheet of sensitive paper. Kieslowski chooses the sweet and gentle Irene Jakob to play the main character of his first movie after the worldwide famous Dekalog. It's impossible to forget the scene where the protagonist 'lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower to the rain' (please, Sting, excuse me you can) to receive the raindrops in her face with open arms and to feed on their tonic energy. The movie is imbued with a flavor of magic innocence and candor and painted in light tones, while the music composed by Zbigniew Preisner seems to burst forth from the bowels of the film substance. The director models all around the figure of the protagonist a world of the same consistence of the marzipan, the same gracefulness of harmonious notes levitating in the air, the same delicacy of a handful of romantic kisses given passionately. All things considered, « The double life of Véronique » looks like an inexhaustible hymn to the life and to the capacity of regeneration peculiar to our vital tissues after an indirect experience of death, thank to the discovery of the absolute love, impalpable like the atmosphere that surrounds the whole story, unlikely and ethereal at the same time, sublimed by strange relations referring to subtle Kieslowskian metaphors always on the look-out. A kind of love bred by sudden tumults of passions wrapped in the thickest mystery, that come true thank to mysterious sound messages referring to a station touched lightly by the shadow of destiny.",10,12,26,9 March 2005
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Tearing and cathartic report about every distortions in faith.
","The Tragedy is being consummated. The Passion is reaching its apex. 'You are burning a Saint!', this is the scream of anguish of the people, witness of this poignant event, very deeply moved by the excruciating agony of Joan of Arc, flame beyond the flame. Very short hair, fine features in spite of her social condition of uncultured peasant, deep and large eyes burning of the same unquenchable fire bound to put an end to her life: this is our heroine, whose beauty is emphasized at once by her great faith in the infinite mercy of God.She never staggers under the heavy burden of her charge in the presence of her inquisitors, unreal and monstrous entities whose hardheartedness shows up on their grotesque features and on their unnatural animal-like attitude, judging by their perverse faces distorted by extremely short focal length lenses. They look like personified devilish entities engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, their ugliness accentuated by a series of uncommon close-ups contrasting with Joan's wonderful face that shows the extreme dramaticity of her situation instead, compelled to endure her pain with great courage and to bear the heavy weight of her cross with resignation, without losing her steady disposition of soul, wanting to go through with her rigidity of principles at the cost of her life.Satanic grimaces, devilish sneers, derisive laughters and spittle emphasize the ineluctable course of this absurd justice system while the vision of her holocaust hovers above the head of the sacrifical victim, so fragile, so vulnerable when fighting in defense of her behavior, so unheard when holding her own opinion, so unprotected when pleading her cause. She objects strenuously to everything they say because faith leads people to do things they never would have imagined themselves capable of, but her passionate words flow away like feeble whispers in a windy day, while her enchanting eyes scan an invisible sky, looking for something beyond her human strength, beyond every possibilities of the common mortals, maybe a divine sign from above, even if there's no question about her unshakable devotion to God, because 'God knows where He bring us', she thinks, 'but we are able to know the road to Him only when we reach the end of it.' Every sequences are included in the above described oppressive scenario whose hypnotic suggestion expressionist style reminds us of the universal sense of pain ready to penetrate deeply into the substrate of our Christian and human consciences, in the inmost recesses of the soul, sharing our hidden emotions awakened by the vision of a defenseless face appealing for mercy in vain, without never losing her dignity.Joan, of Arc, splendidly played by Renée Falconetti in this 'PASSION', might be considered the symbol of the eternal suffering of human beings, adorned with an aureole of beauty and holiness, set on a supreme pedestal, higher and higher than every other female characters of the history of cinema, namely the ideal heroin per antonomasia especially thanks to the heart-rending final purification, moving and endless journey around the deep black of human soul, around the meanders of a faith itinerary stranded for ages on the sand-banks of a devastating fanatic pragmatism. Tearing and cathartic report about every distortions in faith.",10,3,6,25 August 2005
Three Colors: Blue," The peremptory withdrawal into an existence of self solitude
","A blurred image of a car driving along a country road first, hardly perceived by the young passer-by. And after a few seconds the CRASH, awful, appalling, ineluctable. The half-conscious eye becomes prematurely aware of the death announcement. Almost before the woman realizes it, things have gone too far and it's impossible for her to back out from living damnation. So from an hospital bed of suffering a scream of anguish arises suddenly, seen as a peremptory withdrawal into an existence of immeasurable self solitude, as a controversial evidence of a disillusioned and insignificant future. There it is, the cathartic route to desolation row of a woman voluntarily immersed into voids of memory and determined to erase the past from her mind, doomed to cancel the loss of her family as a free self-imposition thank to the complete repudiation of every sentiments, as if her fate weren't discouraging enough.Julie's route is intended as a cry for freedom. As a release from musical reminiscences thrown into the dust-bin, from the possession of material things whose recollection can stop the healing of open wounds, from love involvements in the enclosed space of some anonymous, empty rooms. Julie's freedom is very heavy, it makes her perceive its oppressing presence every moments of her life, but on the other hand it helps her to empty her mind of every sad recollections of her past. But the line between pain and oblivion is very thin, and sometimes she doesn't even realize she's crossing it.Juliette Binoche puts her heart and brain (more the last one than the first one) into acting the disconsolate widow. Her performance is personally inspired by Annie Dupré's book 'The black angel', based on the death of the writer's parents in a car crash. Her character is damned to perpetual interior torment, into the BLUE, deprived of the faculty of emerging cathartically to light, necessary intermediate stage to reach a new existential balance.And we can find the BLUE everywhere. BLUE like the reflections of the swimming pool, faithful companion in solitude, relaxing amniotic liquid whose embrace is so welcoming! BLUE like the color of her empty room, once beaming with joy. BLUE like the chandelier, brought with her as the only memory of happy days gone by. BLUE like the notes of the scale that run after each other on the musical pentagram playing a growing hymn to love. But mainly BLUE as symbol of the cold void of the soul fallen on her back, temporarily deaf to the bells of life resounding around it.",10,2,4,19 August 2005
