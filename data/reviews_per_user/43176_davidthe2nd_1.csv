E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," IMDb top 250
","How come E.T the Extra-Terrestrial isn't in the IMDb top 250 movies yet it has a score of 7.8? X-men 2 is in it and that film has a score of 7.7. Could someone please explain what on earth has happened, surely this is a technical error or is there another reason for this. It's much better than some of the rubbish on the top 250 movies (which for some films I have no idea how it got there in the first place) and should take it's rightful place among other classics. E.T usually comes pretty high up in most greatest films lists and most of them our out of one hundred. How is it that some people just do not seem to like this film?",8,1,3,20 December 2004
