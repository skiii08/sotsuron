The Rock," Big dumb fun!
","In an attempt to get the US Government to pay for soldiers lost on secret missions General Hummel and a group of soldiers steal biological weapons and take control of Alcatraz, threatening to launch on San Francisco if their demands are not met.  Running out of options the FBI take Mason out of prison as he has a knowledge of the island, being the only man to have escaped from there.  Mason and bio-chemical expert Goodspeed join a group of Navy SEALS to enter the island and destroy the weapons before they can be used.  However the death of the whole SEAL unit leaves Mason and Goodspeed to use stealth to avoid the terrorists and destroy the weapons.This is nothing more than a big summer blockbuster that relies on plenty of big bangs to get it's audience.  It relies on the usual Die Hard set-up of 'one man (2 men!) take on heavily armed group in set location'.  However here the plot is a little iffy - Hummel isn't a terrorist, in fact his stance is almost sympathetic.  This makes it all a little funny morally but the film turns it round at one point to go back into traditional good guy/bad guy roles so that the audience don't start to think too much!  The action is very good - plenty of bangs for your buck!  Even though it's all pretty OTT (like the car chase at the start) the mood of the film is such that it's all a great deal of fun.Connery is really good in the lead and is funny and rather dashing!  Cage's character is not as good and is too weedy at the start and some of his dialogue is grating.  The support cast is deep and really good - usually big budget action movies have some well known support actors but this has tonnes!  Check the names - Ed Harris, David Morse, John Spencer, William Forsythe, Michael Biehn, John C. McGinley, Bokeem Woodbine - the list goes on!Overall, if you hate big, dumb summer movies then you'll hate this.  I'm split down the middle but the sheer sense of fun that this brings combined with a great cast makes this a winner in my book!",Null,6,8,23 January 2002
The Devil's Advocate," Enjoyably silly and over-the-top legal thriller
","Kevin Lomax is on a record run of unbeaten cases  previously as a prosecutor and now a defender.  When he manages to get a man accused of child abuse judged innocent (despite being guilty), he is heat hunted by a big New York law firm and is enticed up to try out.  He joins the firm and begins to amass success, meanwhile however his wife is slowly losing her grip on reality and his boss, John Milton, appears to have every excess known to man as part of his lifestyle.I'm sure it is meant to be a twist and I should write `spoiler' on my subject line, but if anyone doesn't know that the head of the law firm is Satan then I'm sorry for spoiling it for you here.  The title may have given you a clue and the name `Milton' might have been a little hint, but apologies!  It is no surprise that he is the devil as this is the point of the film.  The plot is a little OTT but enjoyably so, playing up excesses in all areas and making gleeful swipes at the material rich of the Western world (I assume the director lives in a modest house in a rough area?).  The film still carries an air of legal thriller to it that is good and it is only really let down by an overly twisty end and an overlong epilogue.What makes the film work so very well is the performances.  The cast is deep in well known faces, but it is Pacino's film all the way.  His flamboyant overacting is perfect here and he is totally engrossing all the way  peaking in his final rant at God, the `absentee landlord', the `sadist'. The film wisely never goes too long without him as he is the key  the subplots involving Marie-Anne are still good but not as enjoyable as the title character.  Reeves is good but never totally convinced me that he was as brilliant a legal mind as the script suggests.  Theron is good and undergoes a believable transformation during the film.  Support is good from Jones, Lindo, and Ivey but it is never anyone else's film but Pacino, who revels in the chance to overplay and ham it up.Overall this is not a great film  it is too obvious (think Angel Heart) and is OTT in all aspects of delivery.  However it is an enjoyably hammy film that is driven from it's heart by a perfectly over the top performance from Pacino.",Null,2,5,20 July 2003
The Blair Witch Project," Over-hyped but fresh and scary
","In the woods outside of Burkittesville, Maryland a legend exists about the Blair Witch who supposedly killed many children in the 1940's.  A trio of film makers decide to go into the woods for their student project to document what they find in comparison with the legend itself.  They go missing.  A year later their footage is discovered and pit together to reveal what they went through when they became lost in the woods.  This film is the footage they recorded.There is no doubting that hype was both the making and breaking of this film.  The hype got this small, no-budget film into multiplexes world wide where otherwise it wouldn't have got in the front door.  However the hype also raised expectation so that people were expecting the horrors to end all horrors etc.  Viewed without any hype this would have been so much better  but on a wave on such expectation few things can avoid coming down a bit.Outside of this the set up is very good  put forward as true.  The way the film starts by mixing interviews with recollections of the legend etc gives us enough information to join the trio on their journey.  The film then begins to journey into the woods and the tension build nicely as we share some of the group's fear.A lot of this comes down to the cast  they all start cheerful and young but as they go on they do seem genuinely tired and scared  this helps us believe.  The hand held cameras add to the realism but also put us right there with the group (if also means we don't see things but the fear comes from what's outside of eye line).Now the film is very basic but in many ways that helps it.  There is no hidden subtext, no baggage  just things going downhill.  The film ends in the most basic way and is good for it.  While it may not be the most scary thing ever seen, it is refreshing to se a horror film that isn't another cliché ridden slasher flick.Overall it may be overhyped and be suffering from a certain amount of backlash, but this is a very sharp, tight, clever and scary little film.  It is best viewed as a great independent and not a multiplex filler that it was hyped to be.",Null,6,13,27 July 2002
The King's Speech," A touch over-hyped but a high-calibre film across the board – accessible, enjoyable and engaging
","There was a section in The Times this morning that stated that, two weeks after release, 1 out of every 20 people in the UK had seen this film. My first attempt to see it (at an off-peak showing) failed as it was sold out, partly as a result of the film having almost nothing but positive things about it and if the Oscars do not give it a couple then the Bafta's will almost certainly make sure it has a few awards on its poster when it comes to time to sell the DVD. So it was a little hard for me to come to this film with an open mind, since every bus shelter, magazine and poster is busy telling me how amazing it is. I came to it with a bit of cynicism though, since it is awards season and at this time of year we do see plenty of 'worthy' films that everyone praises but ultimately don't deliver in the longer term.This cynicism wasn't helped by the film appearing to have what it takes to appeal to as many viewers as possible and also be classic awards-friendly material. This cynicism didn't last very long though because it had been forgotten to be replaced by how engaged and rather charmed I was by this film. The basic plot sees Duke of York struggling to overcome his stammer – with a long line of failed attempts and discarded doctors. Eventually he ends up at the door of unorthodox doctor Lionel Logue – an Australian of all things – and, while progress appears possible if the Duke can let go, events conspire to make progress even more important than ever. It tells this story with a surprising amount of humour and drama, making it accessible and modern, without totally moving away from being reasonably true to the characters and the time.It doesn't have quite the complexity that I had hoped from the hype but it is engaging throughout and all that it does works well. Moments of insight (fictional or not I don't know) into the King come infrequently but they are very well done when they come, while the comedy is appropriate and is written and delivered within the story so that it never feels separate from it. Seidler's script is certainly 'good' and he does well to capture this piece of history but I don't think that the film represents a brilliant piece of writing as some have said. Hooper's direction is good and I particularly liked some of his shot framing – characters off-centre from solo shots, good use of the tremendous sets etc. However where the film deserves praise without doubt is in the performances.Firth is a definite Bafta winner and looks very good for the Oscar and not just because of who he plays but how he plays it. He is engaging, sympathetic and he convinces in his stammer and his character. It is not a novelty act and he does feel like a real person. Most importantly he plays very well with Rush, who himself is great here – getting the pitch just right to bring a light and warm touch to the shared scenes. Bonham-Carter is enjoyable in support and of course, being a British film we have plenty of faces doing solid turns (Jacobi, Gambon, Spall etc). Pearce is a nice find and he provides a solid turn as well.Overall The King's Speech is not the greatest film ever made and those claiming such have perhaps been caught up in the hype as much as those currently placing it high up the IMDb top 250 list! However it is a very good film as it provides an engaging narrative that is personal while also being clear in its national importance. It does this in an accessible and engaging manner with humour and drama used well – everything is of a high calibre here and it produces a total produce that is as well. The performances make it work as well as it does and the film is charming, enjoyable and very British. A tad over-hyped at the moment but still a film worthy of the attention given to it.",Null,8,15,23 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," Good use of the minions make it work even if it is uneven and plot not particularly engaging
","The key thing for me about this film is that the plot really didn't stick in my head. I don't mean the easy summary that Gru is employed to help locate and takedown another super villain suspected to be working out of a local mall, but rather that the detail of it didn't leave a mark. It isn't that I needed an animated kids film to have a really gripping narrative, but here it is a bit meh in its content and pacing. This is where it is weak but generally it manages to shore the film up all around the plot by adding constant cute and funny bits at every turn.As with the first film, the film is at its best when it gives a throwaway moment to Agnes or, more frequently, it lets a minion fall off something. This it does a lot and it is never not funny but at times it does start to feel a little like the film is overusing them and hurting the main characters by comparison. Gru is less interesting and often just feels like a plot device to make a story so that the film can mess around within that frame and this goes for many of the human characters. It does still work though but, while the film is loaded with voices from Carrell, Wiig, Schaal and many others, it really tends to play to its short yellow strengths instead.It is still funny, but the minions should be the cherry on top – not the whole show.",Null,0,0,8 December 2013
Saturday Night Fever," Interesting character piece that could have been better but it is the dancing and soundtrack that make it memorable
","Tony Manero lives in Brooklyn with his parents, grandmother and younger sister. His brother is a priest and he feels like for every bit of pride that his parents have in Frank, it is equalled with the sense of disappointment that they have for Tony and his sister. Spending his days working in a hardware store, the one thing that Tony actually enjoys and feels he is good at is disco dancing, and he is a star in his local club. When he meets the annoyingly bitchy Stephanie he gains a dancing partner for an upcoming competition, although she is a difficult character and not the sort of female relationship that he is used to being with. With all this around him Tony tries to look forward to a direction in his life.I noticed this film coming back onto television recently and I wasn't going to watch it because I had already seen it a few years ago. However, when I thought about it all I could actually remember was the famous dancing scenes - I then realised that I was actually remembering these from Airplane! Anyway, I decided to watch this again so that I could hold an opinion about it in regards more than just the dancing scenes. Watching it again I can understand why we all remember the soundtrack and dancing more than the plot, because they are the best aspects of the film. The plot is mostly a character piece with Tony at the heart of it and it is interesting enough to fill the running time as it gives us a good impression of the world he is in and his feelings. The problem comes with the fact that Tony (or anyone in the film in fact) is not that empathetic a character  he is rude, ignorant and pretty spiteful towards women. This is not to say that it damages the film but I did want the script to take me past his exterior to a greater extent than it actually did. In some ways it gets close (Tony's disbelief in his own ability works) and it is worth seeing but it needed to do more and be more consistent.The plot around the dance contest isn't that interesting but it does produce some colourful and fun dance numbers that are all played out to a superb disco soundtrack that did have me rocking in my seat. Travolta copes well with the acting and the dancing, although I would have preferred a bit more humanity in him than he brought out but then again I suppose that was the whole point. Gorney is OK but is surprisingly bland past her very obvious character. Pescow is much better and produces a character that we actually cared about even if we never really get to know her. The support cast has too much in the way of cliché and stereotype to really be effective and they didn't make much of an impression with me.Overall this is a good film but not a totally successful one. The dancing and soundtrack are both great but what was really needed was better writing. The character study is interesting enough to carry the film and make it worth seeing but it is blunt, cruel towards women and lacking any sense of humanity and realism. Worth seeing but don't expect the fame of the dance scenes to mean it is a classic film for other reasons.",Null,2,6,19 April 2005
The Lobster," Cleverly original, scathing, and sharp – even if the oddity of it all did make it hard to penetrate
","I had heard reviews of The Lobster and, while sounding interesting, it also sounded odd enough to delay me in getting round to seeing it. Like many have said, the plot is weird; single people are sent to a hotel and given a period of time to find a match or else they will be turned into the creature of their choosing and released to the wild. Those struggling can add days to their stay by being successful on hunts for those singles who have broken free and live as collective individuals in the woods.The concept is cleverly constructed so that it is weirdly convincing despite its utter absurdity. Within this the film satirizes relationships, singles – in particular the extremes of those two situations. The push for companionship, with its common ground, and its rituals, and the digs at elements of life such as children distracting from conflict. Perhaps it hit a bit too close to home with its regimented rituals, and awkward neediness. On the other side the extreme version of singlehood is also dug at once we are in the woods. It is not as clever as some would tell you, nor as smart, but it is certainly interesting, darkly funny, and pretty engaging throughout. It doesn't pull it off totally, but I enjoyed it from start to finish – its oddity runs through from the ideas, the performances, down into the specific dialogue. Having such a great cast helps, but the tightness of creative vision throughout is what holds it all together. As odd and slightly unsuccessful as it is, it is still well worth watching.",Null,0,1,29 March 2017
Moneyball," Slow-paced but engaging story that benefits from charismatic performances from the leads
","The Oscar nominations this week just added to the reasons I had for wanting to see a film that had been surprisingly praised in the UK when it first came out. I do like baseball – not enough to watch it for hours and hours every few days but enough to go see a game when I'm in the US or sit in a bar there for the important games, but with Moneyball the subject is less the action on the field but more the discussions in the offices. The result of this is a film that lacks the big emotional moments of action that you'll get with other baseball movies, but instead produces a really nice slow-burn that satisfies and engages throughout.The way it does this is deceptive because it seems all very easy because it doesn't have any moments of 'big' writing, no dialogue that soars above the audience, no one moment where the film is all tied up or where the audience feels the urge to applaud. Instead it is really quite natural throughout and it makes for an engaging way to tell the story. The stats are made accessible and the viewer is brought inside the day-to-day of making the approach work but where it really succeeds is in the telling of Beane's story – of him overcoming doubters, sticking to his gut (ironically given his approach) and making it work. He is the heart of the film and he is the reason why I didn't mind spending the games with him, unable to see what was happening but still feeling like I was in the right place.Pitt is a massive part of this working as well as it does and it is why he got the acting nod. He is natural, charismatic but uses his star-power well to have presence but not to be distant from the viewer. As he has gotten older he seems to have added layers to his acting ability and this and Tree of Life marks an excellent year for him. He is well supported by Jonah Hill who doesn't play up the comedy fat-guy role he so often has, but instead is nervy, insecure and intelligent and the pairing makes for a good combination throughout. Supporting roles are equally good and the film generally has a natural and engaging feel of reality.It must be said that Moneyball is a slow film and those expecting big moments or something thrilling will be prone to disappointment but this will be to do with their expectations, not the film. In place of this the film produces great performances, a natural air, an accessible tone and a roundly satisfying and engagingly-told story. It won't blow you out of your seat, but it is a solidly strong film from start to finish.",Null,1,2,29 January 2012
The Avengers," Consistently enjoyable effects and noise with the right amount of fun mixed in
","You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film – a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the 'puny god' moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining – it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.",Null,4,10,6 September 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Bland, mass-produced rubbish that nobody seems to have put any heart into making
","Normally I would write a plot summary before I review a film - it helps introduce the film in case anyone is reading but mostly I do it because it helps me focus my mind on what I have just seen. However to summarise National Treasure 2 it is probably easiest just to take two dice and for one die assign each number the name of a person in history (Queen Victoria, Nixon, Custer), then for the other assign an object (a table, the Empire State Building, a book). Now simply roll the two dice and make notes of the combinations - Custer's rifle, the President's watch, the Queen's bedroom etc etc. After a couple of rolls you will have as much of a story as this film and indeed may have produced a more interesting one.If you haven't got it yet, I thought the plot was utter nonsense that seemed to have had scenarios imagined up and then threaded together with the barest or logic (or none in many cases). Some of the scenes where Cage works out the clues had me laughing and one imagines that the writers made more use of shoe-horns than they did pens and paper. My personal favourite lack of logical is where a major clue is thrown out a car window to stop the bad guys chasing them and all our heroes have to look at is a photo taken of the clue by a speed camera that they drive past. What? Weirdly though, the plot is not the sole problem with the film and indeed it could have been covered for if everything else had worked in regards delivery. As it is though, it seems that there is no heart or energy in the film and that churning out another product to appease the Disney shareholders was top of the reasons for making it. This shows in every regard. It shows in the very bland 'look' to the film. It is clear that lots of money has been spent on the sets and general design of the film but yet none of it feels like more than a set and certainly none of it really convinces as the real thing. This feel continues into the action sequences which again are bland. If the film had genuinely had excitement or thrills then the plot holes become less important but the rubbish action just leaves everything sitting out there exposed to the cold light of day. A gutless car chase through London only serves to highlight how awesome all those Bourne chases were and, by return, how pathetic this one is.And then we have the incidental music, which tends to be one of two type - both equally misjudged and annoying. The first is the 'earnest swelling sense of importance' music that accompanies any discussion of the treasure-hunt, family ancestors or patriotism. It invites you to think that what you are watching is important, which made me think that the composer dialled it in because he cannot have watched this and thought this approach would work with this material. The other type is the 'jaunty, quirky, isn't-this-comical' music that fills the rest of the film. This music invites you to be amused but again it only manages to highlight just how unfunny and clunky all the 'lighter' moments are.The cast list surprised me because if you simply read out the names of those involved I would not have guessed that they were all have been key people in a film this poor. I suppose in a way it is like the rest of the film - clearly there has been money spent but no actual heart or effort is to be found. Cage demonstrates no range or indication that he cares about the material and he makes for a dull hero; his performance is the same when jumping from a crumbling platform and when giving a lecture - it is sad to see someone care so little about what they are doing. Bartha is a weak comic sidekick but at least he appears to be trying. Kruger is as pretty as she is pointless and generally just seemed to be in the way. Harris has a good presence and at least brings a bit of menace to the film while managing to hide his embarrassment, but this is below him and he knows it. Voight is rubbish and Mirren should genuinely be ashamed by a weak performance in a role she took simply to cash in on Oscar and make some good money. Keitel I assume was a bigger character in the first film because other than that there appears to be no reason for him smirking his way around the edges.Overall then, this is a lot of nonsense but, more telling, it is bland and disinterested in the viewer. The plot holes and total lack of logic do treat the viewer with contempt but this could have been covered if I had even once been engaged or enthralled by the film. As it was though it never feels like a film made for any other reason than making money. The cast don't seem to care, the direction is flat, the action is poor and the pace is poor. The fact that it is two hours long only makes it worse as it does not even have the good grace to be short. It is rare I hate a film but I found this poor to the point of being insulting because it is not like it tries but just misfires but rather than it is poor simply because it could not be bothered to even try.",Null,18,36,17 February 2008
Blade Runner 2049," Engaging and thoughtful even if the pacing and sudden action doesn't always work
","A very high profile film from last year, with a high profile cast and director to return to a film considered a modern classic in terms of its influence as well as its value as a film. We join the world again after many years, and follow a replicant Blade Runner chasing down older models. The specific case which opens the film leads him on the trail of what appears to be the first time a replicant has reproduced 'organically'. While 'K' tries to locate this supposed child, he is haunted by connected memories; and at the same time another replicant is dispatched by Niader Wallace to get there first.As a narrative the film is interesting in terms of its base elements, but moreso because of how quickly it embraces the central themes which were in Blade Runner; of reality, or memory, of free-will. At first it jarred me a bit by how open it was about who was a replicant and who wasn't, but it made sense and was well framed in this world. It pushes for thoughtfulness and open questions, but manages to make it work without seeming like it is pushing too hard without justification. The pace works against it a bit, and there is really no reason for it to be as long as it is. At times it seems a bit labored in how it hangs around in silence, or spends so long to take in the vast expansion of the future landscape or building design, and it does try the patience here and there.The time spent to take in the view is perhaps understandable though because the film looks great. The design, the scale, and the cinematography combine well. Within this the detail includes plenty of items which extend the world of the original film but yet remind us of how ahead of its time it was - aspects are exaggerated into the future perhaps, but yet remain familiar and believable as only being a few steps away from the near future. The cast are good throughout; plenty of famous faces (which is a little distracting at times) but mostly they are effective. Gosling is surprisingly good; very restrained but gives enough in the detail to offer more. Ford is more expressive than I expected, and Hoeks is a strong presence despite her frame. The cast is probably too big, and again it is a way the film could have been tighter in terms of running time. Despite weaker elements though, it is an engaging film that gets the thoughtful tone right, and offers more than it has on the surface.",Null,0,3,24 March 2018
Angels & Demons," The injection of pace and energy makes it much better than the first film even if it is only 'reasonably good'
","The Pope has died and the four favourites to replace him have been kidnapped by someone who threatens to kill them one by one. Meanwhile a canister of anti-matter (the 'God particle') has been stolen from the CERN project – a canister that is not only highly destructive if used incorrectly but also will becoming increasingly unstable and eventually cause great destruction at midnight. Those behind these crimes claim to be the Illuminati, the organisation of science that was thought to have long since been destroyed. The nature of the mystery and the pressure of time causes the Vatican to turn to measures they would not have considered in any other situation – bringing in Professor Robert Langdon to lead the race against time.The sequel to the Da Vinci Code was not something that particularly appealed to me given that I struggled to care or even stay awake through that first film. Angels & Demons though manages to address some of the key problems with the first film – although it cannot address them all because of the source material. What I mean is that it cannot make the plot into something that seems less silly than normal and the storyline does feel a little daft at times. What helps both the film and the plot is the biggest and best improvement that the makers have made – the pace. Where the first film was full of seriousness and worthy to the point of tedium, this film has energy and pace to it that makes the whole thing seem a lot more interesting than it is.We race from clue to clue, we have action sequences and so on and the speed to it helps cover up the weaknesses in the plot, with talking minimised to what is required to have the next running sequence. This is a bit weaker than one would have hoped though, because it does give the film a very episodic feel at times – with a talky bit, then speeding cars and action, then a bit more talking and then more running. Despite this though, it does work pretty well as long it is doesn't hang around too long between action parts and doesn't spend too long on serious religious imagery. When it does do this it flags surprisingly quickly and does start to feel a little heavy but Howard wisely keeps this from happening too often, making it more accessible and with the air of a more enjoyable film.The cast work with this well enough. Hanks spends more of this film doing a traditional 'action hero' type role with lots of shouting and less theorising – perhaps to the annoyance of some but it is what the film calls for. McGregor is so-so here, his accent is odd and his character clear but he is another star in the film so taken as such by me. Zurer fills the Tatu role with not a lot to do or offer beyond her easy looks. Skarsgård, Mueller-Stahl and others give their usual performances to good stead but this is never an actors film so much as that of Howard. As director he doesn't exhilarate but he is a professional man with a lot of resources so he makes the film look good and uses the camera well to provide pace – hardly Bourne stuff but still good.Angels & Demons is an OK film, which may not sound like praise but it does represent a real improvement on the dreadfully dull first film. It has the same core problems but the pace covers a lot of other sins and makes the film feel more engaging and exciting than it probably should have done. I'm not sure I want a third film in this mould but this sequel at least manages to raise itself to be 'reasonably good', for which it (sadly) deserves mention.",Null,4,8,26 July 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An OK film but overlong and lacking it's own voice (spoilers)
","After the murder of O-Ren Ishii and her squad of bodyguards, the Bride continues her quest to kill Bill in revenge for shooting her and leaving her and her unborn child for dead.  Bill warns his deadbeat brother, Budd, of her return and he prepares the best he can.  When her attack on Budd goes wrong, she finds herself buried alive in a graveyard - left to rot and suffer until her last breath.  As she lies trapped she remembers her training from Master Pai Mei and tries to focus on her ultimate goal.Just to set it in context, let me say that I thought Volume I was an OK film but pretty much just soulless style with no substance.  Volume II is a different film but it was still only OK, having the same sort of problem and some of it's own.  I say this from the start because far too many reviewers here seem to see Tarantino films as a sort of sacred grail that can only be loved or hated.  This is, of course, nonsense and such glowing fan-boy praise has put me off reading many people's reviews.  This film is very different from the first volume and many will be let down by the lack of bloody action - but, I'm sorry, if that's all you want from a film then you should go and just rent any of your bottom shelf actioners from your video store.  Here we have far more dialogue and longer, slower scenes that require patience.  However this is not to say that the film has more of the substance that I missed from the first film - and reviewers who say that this film provides the heart and substance to volume I's guts are just wrong - substance is not snappy dialogue.Substance is character and story.  Here we are given a bit more plot in the form of back story but the film is still very much based on a revenge story that other directors with much smaller budgets would have had the good taste to deliver in under half the four hour running time of this film.  However it still fails to really give us characters that we can care about enough to get emotionally into the film.  Some of them are interesting - Budd in particular has a certain world weary acceptance of things on one hand, but then contradicts this characteristic about two scenes later.  The ending of the film is particularly weak because of this total lack of emotional involvement - the sudden requirement that we care about the Bride's situation is too much and just comes across as cutesy nonsense, likewise the actual manner of Bill's death will disappoint both those seeking emotion and action.  Action fans will wonder why Tarantino ignores the rules of the genre he is aping and makes the death low-key; but it would have been a great ending if we had had better characters - if Bill had been someone we had gotten to know it would have worked much better. The ending is, fitting with the spaghetti western homage, very much like Fonda's in Once Upon A Time In The West, but his was impacting for the same reasons that Bill's in not.Speaking of homage's, there are so many here that it becomes a film that will probably be enjoyed by those with a good working knowledge of cinema. The film opens with The Postman Always Rings Twice and continues with references and nods to John Ford, Sergio Leone, Carrie and others.  While these styles are all copied well I did start to wonder if Tarantino had his own voice - there was barely a scene that was `his', even his comic book dialogue has become a sort of cliché onto itself.  As a fan of spaghetti westerns, I enjoyed much of the film as I don't find it slow or dull when it is done in this context, to me the long looks and slow talk is part of that genre and I generally like it.  I enjoyed this element as I have never seen a spaghetti western on the big screen and enjoyed seeing this; also I enjoyed the copies of John Ford's work - at least Tarantino has used his break from directing to watch some movies that come from before his own lifetime.  The whole Pai Mei segment is amusing but hardly original - hell, even the Police Academy movies have copied this exaggerated style, so it being done by Tarantino is not that impressive.  It is true that all his movies have had references to other movies and his direction has aped different genres but he has never done it to the point that he has here - here he loses his own voice and if I had only seen this film I would think that Tarantino is only able to copy what he has seen rather than use it in his own way.The lack of characters is helped by the improvement of dialogue - here we actually have people speaking rather than just people killing each other in a soulless manner.  The dialogue is well written and makes the people more than just sword fodder, even if they aren't ever real people we care about. As writer Tarantino is able, even if this is far from his best work and it did feel at times like he was just doing what people expected of him. However he should really have cut back on his film's running time.  As a stand alone, this film is too long for it's flimsy foundation to support - it's not horribly overlong but it could have lost 20 minutes and benefited from it.  Certainly, as `one' film, four hours plus is an absurdly long running time for this material.The acting is a bit better here than in the first film but Thurman is as bland and wooden as she was in the first film.  Her sudden mother's instincts at the end are all the more laughable for her complete lack of human emotion up till this point.  It is Carradine who makes this film though, and his performance is not so important as his presence, which is impressive.  He doesn't always convince saying the lines put in his mouth (the superman monologue in particular) but he is a good presence in the film.  Madsen is good despite giving the same performance that he does in every film he does.  Hannah is cool and is a good baddie, standing out from the majority of them - her vampy performance suits the film's style.  Liu is great fun and seems to enjoy spoofing the genre he is best known for (well, homaging rather than spoofing maybe).  Generally the performances are as good as the material deserves, they are not good enough to make the characters real or involving, but that is as much the material's fault as theirs.Overall this is an OK film.  It is not a great film and it is not a rubbish film.  Tarantino films are just films, they are not the word of god and they will have good points and bad points, the hope is that the good will outweigh the bad and, generally this manages to hit that balance.  The mix of genres makes it interesting but Tarantino shows that the maturity he showed in Jackie Brown was only a blip or a fluke.  Instead he shows his immaturity by aping the work of others so much that he loses his own voice - on top of this his indiscipline makes both films (separately and together) overlong and he really needs to find an editing partner who can help him in the same way as Martin Scorsese generally has.",Null,11,25,2 May 2004
First Man," Slow, responsible, and balanced but produces quite the emotional aspect too
","First Man is not the film for air-punching relief at the end of tense scenes of danger which have been preceded by tender scenes making us care about the people in those moments; this is not to say that on this basis alone that it is a better film than those that do these things, but it is certainly different. There is an emotional core to the film but mostly it is deliberately distant, cold, and balanced. The Armstrong of the film is all these things, and the film follows him in that way. There are no big moments to speak of - even the moon walk is reflective and silent.This produces a film that engages by how consistent it is, and the feeling of accuracy and observation. It runs long but if you get the feel/pace early on then it doesn't feel it. Instead it offers more character in Armstrong, as hard as it is at times to like him, it is engaging for how he is. The downside of this approach is that the film can be boring if you aren't going with it or if you wanted it to be more like Apollo 13. While at times I wanted it to have at least some scenes like that, it worked well without them, and the impact of the opening scenes ripples through the final ones because of how restrained it all is.Chazelle's direction gets this tone right, and produces a convincing performance from Gosling. It is an odd one because it seems so featureless but yet there is a lot there. He is well supported by a host of recognizable but not too recognizable faces, but it is Claire Foy who gives the film its heart, and pulls off the difficult job of having the human, emotional moments but yet not making them feel like they are breaking out into a different film.First Man is slow and deliberate, but it works for what it sets out to do, and plays like a responsible, balanced, and even-handed bopic which manages to have more of an emotional impact due to how little of it is worn on the sleeve or shouted over the orchestra.",Null,1,2,2 June 2019
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Overly sentimental and needlessly mystical guff that no amount of professional polish can minimise
","The depression hit the south hard, particularly John Invergordon who commits suicide and leaves his estate (and debts) behind to his daughter Adele. She refuses to let her father's golf course be sold off cheap and decides to organise a high stakes golf tournament between the leading players of the day. However the would-be buyers of the course argue that it should not happen because Savannah is not represented; but a young boy volunteers golfer Rannulph Junuh and the crowd take it up. However Junuh is knackered  he had a very bad war and has lost all ability he once had, although he knows he should step up to the tournament.The terrestrial television premier of most big films in the UK is usually an event and it is only after multiple screenings that see it gradually slip into being filler material in less key timeslots. So with this film I should have smelled a rat with the fact that it premiered on a normal Friday afternoon  far from being the prime slot that the names involved would suggest it deserves. However bookended with two sentimental TV movies seems a pretty fair place for it to be resting given that it essentially a mushy piece of fluff that will mainly appeal to those that like that sort of stuff. The story is told as a memory, which only serves to make the mush and the sentiment easier to produce (not a good thing) and it does it in spades  a fact not helped by the very slow pace that the whole thing is delivered by. I can forgive it being corny if it doesn't take itself too seriously but my god but it does; line upon line of dialogue are written like scripture and as if they have deep meanings  this stops it being fun or light and just makes it come off as pretentious.Of course it is still watchable despite this  just. Mainly this is down to the very polished product that it is, although this only manages to partially cover the cracks rather than actually manage to reduce them. This professionalism can be seen in the classy direction but, despite this I did always hope that Redford would put as much into the story and the characters as he did the looks. Without help the cast struggle. Damon cannot do much with his character that look pained occasionally because the war experience is really simplified and never personal or real. However his character looks like it was crafted in detail compared to Bagger Vance and Smith can do nothing with that. At best he just turns on the charm and hopes that he doesn't choke on the amount of corn he has to say  he nearly does it but not quite. Outside of this it also requires a forgiving viewer to ignore that whole Uncle Tom aspect of it and the fact that, in this film, racism does not exist and this stops the period being real. Theron is OK but has little to do while support from McGill and a few others add some degree of class if not substance. I don't care what anyone says, Moncrief was pretty poor, a standard 'cute kid' from start to finish.Overall this is a polished film but it has nothing beyond cheap mush, sentiment and guff that often borders on the pretentious. It fits the daytime schedules well but doesn't deserve any more than that. The cast all struggle with the lack of substance and with this failing it doesn't really matter how many polished shots and swelling musical moments are used because many viewers will simply struggle to care.",Null,2,9,17 August 2005
Black Swan," Engaging psychological horror despite not being as 'high-brow' as the ballet frame suggests
","Esteemed IMDb writer Theo Robertson messaged me the other day about this film and, while I skimmed it for fear of having him influence me in terms of his opinion, I did read that several older people had walked out of this film, seemingly having expected some sort of high-brow film with its roots in ballet. One can understand why because with all the award buzz and the superficial subject matter (ballet) combined with the actress and of course the previous work of the director, this must surely be an intelligent piece to be 'appreciated' and 'considered'. What one wouldn't expect would be a film that, with a bit more gore, could easily be just another trashy horror/thriller that is released on video and has plenty of sex, violence and jump scares to it.Well, got news for you, this is what Black Swan is – albeit a superior example of the genre. Essentially our lead character struggles to get in touch with her dark side when she wins the lead in Swan Lake, gradually losing touch with reality and/or being hunted by those around her who wish her harm. This manifests itself through some painful scenes of self-harm, imagined doppelgangers, intense sexual discovery, shadowy figures and a domineering mother who keeps her controlling menace under a veil of vulnerability that only falls here or there. It is trashy stuff in a way but it is done very well so that it produces this genre material but does so in a way that feels slightly classy while also engaging more than it would thanks to a brilliant turn by Portman.And she is brilliant. I understand the mother because of how well Portman plays – this is not a character she has worked on for a few months, this feels like a product of years under the influence of this mother. She is nervous to her core, frustrated by her own inability to be this 'thing' that she has spent her life not being – wild, loose, imperfect. Portman nails it and while I don't think it is a brilliant film, her performance is little less than brilliant. In support Hersey is equally as good with less time to do it. The flickers across her face say so much and I was impressed that with so little I was able to understand roughly what had happened in the previous 20 years. Cassel is simplistic but effective in his predatory director turn. Kunis is unbelievably sexual and again she helps the lead role by showing us everything that Nina struggles to find in herself. Ryder is solid in a smaller role. Aronofsky's direction is strong but particularly impressive is the cinematography – the camera flows so well around the scenes (and yet appears in no mirrors). I think he knows he is making a horror movie so, although he embraces the ballet, he doesn't avoid the shock or the build of the horror.Some have embraced this film as art and a thing of beauty – while others have come away disappointed because that is what they expected it to be but didn't find it. However Black Swan is an effective psychological horror movie that just happens to be set in the world of ballet. As such it is very much a genre movie even if the director etc lift it to feel like more. In particular Portman makes the film – I cannot think I have seen her better and her Oscar (can there be doubt?) will be deserved.",Null,33,48,31 January 2011
Changeling," An engaging and professional drama despite the misgivings
","Awards season carries with it a raft of films that are 'Oscar-worthy' and all tend to be released in the UK during January and February. I understand the reasons for doing this but sadly it is not for the sake of the viewer because most cinema goers do not want a glut of films in one month and then nothing till the summer time but then I suppose awards = money and this is what the studios want. Changeling came out in the UK at the fore of this season (in November/December I think) so I managed to catch it then and did so with Oscar hype and awards chatter in my ears. I managed to block out a lot of this though as I have been burnt before and I came to the film with little knowledge of the plot and not quite sure what to expect from it.Perhaps this helped me because I do seem to have enjoyed the film more than some other viewers here. What I found was a quite engaging drama that is helped by its 'true story' tag but is solid enough to stand up on its own regardless. The whole narrative is charged with injustices and emotion and it is hard not to care as events unfold  I was quite held by it and I can't see the view of those that say it was dull. The downside of the film is that, while the events grip, the emotional heart of the film is surprisingly cold, with the viewer putting in most of their feelings and the film coasting on this. By nature of the story the viewer will bring a lot to the table and I did feel that the film coasted on this to a certain degree. This does hurt it because the lack of that on the screen does perhaps contribute to some viewers not being drawn in by it.Eastwood's direction is part of it as it is a bit too clinical  it makes it feel of the period perhaps but the cold edge is the con to that pro. Likewise the casting of Jolie. I agree with Eastwood's comment that her 'look' fits the period, because her face certainly does, however this is not enough and I found her performance to be a bit lacking  not bad but just 'ok' with 'give me an award' moments in there as well. One can easily imagine what a better and more able actress could have done with the material. The rest of the cast are solidly good in the same way  with nobody really setting the world on fire but yet plenty of recognisable faces and names doing good work in smaller roles. The film belongs to Jolie though and, on the basis of that ownership one can understand why she was nominated for her Oscar while, at the same time, seeing why she didn't actually deserve to win it either.The liberties with factual detail did not bother me at the time of viewing (as I didn't know the story at all) and didn't after I read up about them (I try to see 'true' films as an entry level summary rather than fact) and generally I did find the film to be engaging and professionally made across the board (acting, sets, direction). The problem with it is that it is quite cold and it doesn't produce people so much as it does events. These events are sufficient to make for a good film but the lack of more prevents it being more than this.",Null,3,8,26 March 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Improves on the third film but is still just a lot of empty noise without enough fun
","I remember the first film in this theme-park-inspired franchise. I liked it. It was fun, didn't take itself too seriously and was as light and playful as the cowardly and comical Captain Jack. That was nearly a decade ago and a lot has changed since then. For one thing the franchise has to content with the fact that the third film was a terrible dog – plodding, dull, overly-serious and provided big action sequences that for all their cost didn't have a second of fun in them. I ignored On Stranger Tides in the cinema (as I did with the majority of the summer blockbusters this year) because I had no high hopes for it and no reason to spend nearly £20 to see those low expectations fulfilled.On DVD it hurts less so I tried it here. On the positive side the film is better than the previous one. It seems to have recognised that it isn't some amazing sea-faring epic but just a silly piece of entertainment based on a theme-park ride. As a result it seems a little freer with itself and at times it seemed to suggest that my entertainment was something it had an interest in. Sadly it doesn't do this often enough or well enough to really lift it up to be a film worth seeing. Along with the less serious tone, the film delivers loads of action sequences with lots of special effects – they are large, they lit up the walls in my front room and they provided enough bass to make me happy with my choice of speakers. But that's about it because they are, like the film, dramatically empty. You never really feel peril for the main characters and there is little dramatic reason to care – so, while the effects and sets are expensive, the money is wasted as they do not have the content to make it work.In terms of the writing, one problem is the transformation of Captain Jack into an indestructible superhero. Where once he seemed to be winging it, now he seems to be in charge; where once he appeared cowardly, now he rushes into danger. OK the words out of his mouth suggest otherwise, but the action doesn't. It makes it harder to like him and, while Depp's performance hasn't changed, the character certainly is a lot less entertaining than he originally was. Speaking of the cast, a few key names are absent but bigger ones are brought in. Cruz was potentially a nice bit of casting as she does have a passionate air about her and seems to be able to ooze sexuality with ease; sadly the film doesn't use her well and, although she looks good, she cannot find that spark – something I would have thought would have been so easy for actors like her and Depp to get. Rush returns and does his thing while McShane takes the role of the main baddie. Again this should have been an open goal but he is too one-note. He is still a good presence in the film but I'll take 30 seconds of his Swearengen over 2 hours of him here any day. Graham gets his exposure and payday and who could blame him – but he is capable of so much more than he does here. Richards shows up for an obvious and unfunny cameo while the rest of the support cast are either stuntmen or famous faces for the sake of it.The fourth Pirates film is an improvement on the third – but sadly not by anywhere near the margin it needed to be. It mostly avoids being overly serious but yet it still isn't a great deal of fun to watch. The noise and effects mean the time doesn't drag but it is empty spectacle for the majority of the time and good chunks of it could have been cut to the benefit of the film (the priest and mermaid for example). It isn't absolutely awful by any means but it is bland, empty and nothing like the amount of rip-roaring summer fun it should have been. There will be a fifth of course, but event movies make money, but I really hope they can work out that simply spending more and more money on effects or putting more plotting into the film is not what made people enjoy the first one.",Null,1,4,21 September 2011
Men in Black 3," ET phone it in
","A decade since the previous film and fifteen years since the first, was anyone really looking for this film to be made? Well – apart from the accountants I mean. Despite this, MIB3 came to be this year and I could not have cared less as it entered the cinemas as yet another blockbuster seeking to carry a franchise on for longer than it probably should (although the previous film did that already). The plot here sees Tommy Lee Jones doing as little as possible while Will Smith goes back in time to work with a younger version of him (played by Josh Brolin). The story (such as it is) allows for the usual alien special effects and reasonable set-pieces but there is a common thing that runs through every aspect of the film: it really does just dial the whole thing in.It is hard to describe but it does feel like a film that has been made because somebody calculated what it would cost against what it would make due to franchise legacy, retro-bump and good old fashioned blockbuster appeal. There isn't the energy and fun there was in the first film; it has its moments and it does seem to have the best intentions at heart, but it just doesn't come off. The comedy rarely drew a smile from me – the noise distracted me from my ironing but it didn't do more than that. The action set pieces are so-so despite the effects and generally I wasn't sure what was supposed to hook me into the film because it didn't make me laugh, didn't thrill me, didn't intrigue me and really didn't entertain me. It doesn't have the decency to be bad though – it merely goes through the motions in a way that did very little.The cast involved mystifies me too – so many of them have no need to be in this film unless they had contractual obligations or the pay check was huge (which, given the budget, I guess it must have been for the majority of them). Certainly Will Smith has no need to do this film and he never seems comfortable doing his late 90's routine here – he has grown beyond that and he cannot make it work. Of course he looks like he is hitting every mark when you put him next to Tommy Lee Jones, who looks like he really would sooner be anywhere else if it were for the million or so dollars he is getting for this. Brolin does a good impression of his older version, but it is never more than an impression. Clement is never given anything of note to do while Thompson is just wasted without a doubt. Other faces are in here too, but nobody does anything worth mentioning.Men in Black 3 is the result of a series of business meetings from a studio looking for a profitable summer movie; there can be no other real reason for it existing. This genesis infects the whole film and from acting to writing to set-piece delivery, it all seems to feel like it was dialed in and that the creative juices never flow. Distracting but really nothing more than expensive noise designed to extend a franchise for the sake of extending it.",Null,0,2,20 October 2012
The New World," Although the slow pace and restraint take away something they compliment and support a sense and sight of beauty
","It is the 17th Century and the English are expanding their Empire into new and undiscovered lands. Captain John Smith is in one such expedition and he is holed up in a hasty fort along with his superiors and men, defending themselves from the 'savages'. Smith ventures out with a party to try and trade with the natives but is overwhelmed and captured by them. Only the intervention of the king's daughter, Pocahontas, saves his life and sees him spared to teach her about his world. The pair develop a unspoken bond, with Smith taken by her beauty and innocence. However when he is returned to the fort he knows that the conflict will restart as they have no intention of leaving this land.Another reviewer states that it helps to know what you're getting into before you watch this so that you're not expecting some battle-filled epic. Those comments are valid if a little short-sighted because the truth is the name Terrence Malick should tell you what you need to know in regards this being quite a slow-paced but beautiful film and not one to come to for action-packed plotting and big battle sequences. In terms of narrative we are given the story with a very slight touch, almost like Malick is confident that this is something we should feel rather than just be shown. The 'rules' of shooting that I read after seeing this confirmed what I suspected  that a lot of effort was put into the filming of the visuals and capturing the world that Smith et al stumbled into. Now this sounds like I'm talking about the 'aren't the native people beautiful' film-making of A Man Called Horse, Dances with Wolves etc but this is not what this is. Instead the film just takes its time and allows everything to seep through with striking imagery and shots.Of course for many people the lack of strong narrative flow will be a problem and to be honest at times it was so for me. Long sections occasionally drag where very little happens or is spoken and although mostly the pace works, at times it really does not and I would have liked to have seen some cuts in some small sections  not that it is my place to suggest such! Malick draws out worthy and restrained performances from his cast that match the tone and feel of the film. Farrell and Bale really hold back and it is strange to see them being so restrained and quiet  but it works. Kilcher steals the film with a natural and peaceful performance that is the core of the film and key to convincing the audience as to why people were captivated by her. Studi, Thewlis, Chaplin and others all do solid support while the sharp-eyed Oz fan will spot Alvarez himself in a tiny role.The New World is not a film to come to in a rush or if you are a bit tense and looking for a film to quickly engage and hold you. Instead it is a film that is best suited just flowing over you. Does this make it perfect? Well of course not and those that have issues with the quiet and slow plot and pace are not wrong but actually right. They are however missing the point because these qualities are necessary to match the beautiful visuals and 'feel' of the film, which are what made it worth seeing for me.",Null,2,3,22 June 2008
Scarface," An OK film but overblown, lacking characters and subtlety and with OTT performances to match
","In 1980 the US opened its borders to Cuba to allow those with relatives in the USA to come over and join them. However Castro also takes the opportunity to clear out his jail and over 25000 people with criminal records come over. Among them are Antonio Montana and his friend Manolo, who do a killing for crime boss Frank Lopez in exchange for their green cards. When they carry out another job for Lopez, they are welcomed into the fold and they start to rise up the organisation. However Montana is ambitious and greedy and will not be content until he reaches the very top of the tree.This film seems to have been raised up over time to the point where it is mentioned in the same breath as such superb films as The Godfather and Goodfellas but I must admit, having just seen it for the third time, that I simply cannot see why people seem to hold this in such high regard. It is a good film let me say, but it is not anything more than that. The story charts the rise and fall of drug lord Tony Montana and it is a sweeping tale that always has something going on and thus avoids being dull  however it is far from being without flaws. Comparing this tale to the Godfather is a joke. Montana is not a complex character  he is a grubby little fellow who gets inflated on his own greed and is as violent as he needs to be. As a result the story is rather simple and totally relies on actions rather than characters  making the film overblown for the most part and totally lacking any sort of subtlety or patience. Like Tony himself, the film is all about excess and it gets a bit tiring as a result. The story is ambitious and quite enjoyable but it is no more than that. The film was criticised for being excessively violent when it was released but now it just looks about par for the course; however you can see that it is being deliberately overly violent at times just to make an impact and, sadly, it rarely carries an emotional punch  only a visceral one. This is not too much of a criticism because gore and violence is still impacting on it's own but I always prefer to be emotionally involved rather than just watching it for its own sake and, for all it's memorable lines, the finale is just a hoot  OTT and silly!The film may not have been written with any detail or interesting undercurrents but it does have plenty of memorable lines  which may be a big part of the reason that the film has been remembered for so long. Certainly it will not be remembered for it's well written characters! Montana is the main character and he is simply just a little coke head who is greedy  to compare him to Michael Corleone is a laugh, Montana has no complexity and no character and should not even be compared. Likewise in the supporting characters, there are no complex or even 3-D characters, they are all very simplistic and match the film's overblown nature. It is mostly for this reason that I consider the performances to be mostly poor. For some reason people hold this up as one of Pacino's best performances and I really wish I could understand where they are coming from. Because he has no character to work with Pacino has no choice but to just chew up the scenery. If you look up the word 'ham' in a dictionary you will not only find the description of 'meat from a pig' but you will find a reference to Pacino's performance in this film. He overacts without shame and is memorable for that reason, but to rank this as one of his best performances is just an insult to a great actor such as he  it doesn't compare to Godfather I & II or Dog Day Afternoon and, to me, it ranks as one of his most embarrassing moments of excess. The rest of the cast are just a collection of average 'cooooo-ban' performances albeit from quite a few well known names and faces  Loggia, Abraham, Shenar and Belzer all make appearances. Bauer is quite good but he has little to really work with. Pfeiffer has even less to do and is pretty wasted (literally!) in a minor role. Mastrantonio is a good actress but you wouldn't know it from this film  just like Pacino she is overblown and silly.Overall this is an OK film that is ambitious but ultimately is not worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as things like the Godfathers of Goodfellas. It lacks any sort of complexity or subtlety and is just energetic and noisy rather than being well written. De Palma directs in the same style  every scene is overblown and sweeping, a characteristic that the performances copy to cause a talented bunch of actors to be presented with no characters to speak of and just resort to overacting and scenery chewing  something that Pacino is particularly guilty of.",Null,6,14,24 May 2004
Love and Death," Allen's hilarious send-up of Russian literature and cinema
","Boris Grushenko is the cowardly son of a humble farmer.  Called up to serve in the Napoleonic wars, Boris becomes a hero and is the toast of his town. However he cannot have the love of his live, Sonia.  When the outcome of a duel means they get married.  She convinces him to become an assassin and end the war.  As he sits in a cell on death row, he wonders where it all went wrong.When one speaks of Woody Allen films, it is common to talk of his `early, funnier films' and his later serious work (although that is beginning to change back recently).  Love and Death falls easily into the period of `early funnier films'.  The plot here is very loose and is simply an excuse of a series of observations, one liners and set pieces.  The comedy is a wonderful mix - there is plenty of slapstick, physical comedy.  This is complimented by a huge amount of one liners and witty monologues (his father's piece of land is my favorite, but Boris and Sonia sitting down to meals of snow is also good).  The director shows his literary awareness by littering the film with references - the film itself being one big reference.Allen is the strength of the film - he's totally at ease with the material and is a wonderful clown.  Keaton is good because she is clearly having a great deal of fun.  The rest of the cast is unimportant as the jokes carry the whole film easily.This one of my favorite Allen films - it lacks a structure and is overflowing with the surreal humour that he is so loved for.",Null,3,7,31 January 2002
Frost_Nixon," As enjoyable as it is informative
","David Frost is a light entertainment chat show host with reasonable global fame. Richard Nixon is a disgraced President, stepping down from office in light of allegations of his involvement in the Watergate Scandal. For career reasons, Frost decides to set up a series of interviews, at great cost and increasing personal risk. With both men playing a game to get what they want (for Frost, a career boost and some revelations, for Nixon, his chance to put the record straight as he sees it), the interviews begin recording while the mainstream media fail to show an interest.The interviews in question have always been known to me, but this is not the same as me knowing about them in any meaningful way  which I did not. I had always wanted to see the play when I saw the adverts for it in the paper but never got myself to London to do so  nor did I ever think of it long enough to buy the original interviews themselves. However as a result of seeing the film I will be getting the original interviews as a Christmas gift to myself. The reason for this is that the film version did a great job of presenting the event as culturally important, without overlooking the rather 'insignificant' manner in which it all started out originally  with the whole project being a bit of a laughing stock. It also makes me want to see the play because the script has done such a good job of capturing the characters and the time  especially useful when a large section of the audience will not know a lot about this period and the people other than the names and that we use 'gate' to describe anything dodgy in politics. This script is the basis for the drama but Howard does well as director to convey what is going on at key points while he otherwise delivers a typically professional film in all other regards. At first I wasn't totally sure of the structuring device of having talking heads looking back but it never became spoon feeding so much as it was a useful way of telling the story and providing insight.The cast are very good. Sheen has already shown that he can do impressions without losing his performance and he does it again here  giving us enough of Frost to be instantly recognisable but not to the detriment of his performance. It is Langella that dominates the film with his Nixon  a great character that is hard to do and be compelling but yet he manages it here. The support cast are just that but they are also solidly good with turns from Bacon, Rockwell, Macfadyen, Platt and others. Frost/Nixon is not a fast or thrilling film and I'm sure that the message board will have people complaining 'is that it', but let them carry on demonstrating their failings and just enjoy the film because, even without the cultural importance of the events, it is still a professionally crafted and engaging drama that is as enjoyable as it is informative.",Null,5,10,21 December 2008
Howl's Moving Castle," Has areas where it could have been better but is still a fantastic little film with great animation, characters and plot
","Young Sophie is a plain girl who works in a hat store. When she meets the wizard Howl on her way home she finds herself protected by him as he flees from the demons of the Witch of the Waste. Later that night the Witch visits her in the shop and casts a spell turning her into an old woman but preventing her from telling anyone. Setting out into the wilderness, Sophie comes across Howl's castle and, thanks to a cheeky fire demon, settles in as the new cleaning woman while she can try and work out how to break her curse of old age. However while she retains her young heart in an old body, she learns that Howl has long since lost his heart and the pressure of wars is taking its toll on him.Although it is inferior to Spirited Away in some areas, I scoff at those that heavily criticise Howl for this because this film is still a lot better than a lot of the 'Happy Meal marketing campaigns' that are served up to our children as films. This film has the usual Miyazaki traits of imaginative visuals, a range of characters, magic, humour and an interesting plot that is more than just easy sentiment and cliché. I agree with those that have said it is hard to follow at times because, although the main thrust of the narrative is engaging, I did find it distracting to not totally understand things like Sophie drifting between degrees of age etc. However this still served to engage me as I tried to understand the meaning of it within the plot. The theme of hearts is well used within the film and, again although I didn't understand the narrative totally, I liked the meaning within the story about the importance of the heart within each person. It touched me and although the detail will go over most children's heads, hopefully it should impact upon them to some degree. The pace is pretty good for the most part but I was a bit disappointed with the delivery at the end  it was all neatly tied up and done very quickly; the downside of this being that it does feel a bit forced and obvious in contrast with the more controlled material up to that point (Turniphead's fate is a perfect and unnecessary example of what I mean).The animation is typically beautiful and audiences should guard against accepting this as the standard simply because it is the case so often. I loved the look of the film, from the trademark things like the European feel to the cities, to the design and beauty of the flying machines right down to the usual mix of imagination within the characters. The characters are the usual delight as well  not afraid to make them 'ugly' while also drawing beauty and goodness out of their hearts. Most obviously this is seen in the character of Sophie, who is never better than when she is old  how many other children's films would be confident enough in their audience to put an old woman in the lead role? Howl is just as interesting although his transformation may be hard to follow for younger viewers. Simmons and Mortimer are both good as Sophie although Simmons dominates her younger counterpart. Bale is always good value even if he could have benefited from a slower pace to develop his character better. Crystal is a joy as Calcifer and he adds humour and spark (sorry) to his scenes. Bacall is classy presence in a good character while I liked Hutcherson's turn as Markl.Overall this is not the perfect film because the plot is not as easy to follow as it could have been and the heart (sorry) of the story could have been delivered in a more patient and slower manner, this isn't too much of a problem (although the ending is clumsy) and the majority of the film is strong enough to cover it. The animation is flawless and the characters enjoyable while the story has plenty of interest in there to hold the interest. Has areas where it could have been better but is still a fantastic little film for the family, children or adults.",Null,0,3,25 October 2006
Walk the Line," Really engaging and enjoyable biopic
","Growing up Johnny Cash's ambition was to make it onto the radio with his band but as an adult the reality is different. His wife and family are stuck in poor housing and he is frankly terrible at his door-to-door sales job. Unable to turn down his wife's wish to move towns and for him to take a job her father has offered, Cash turns to a local recording studio in desperation. The band's audition is unimpressive and Cash's delivery uninspiring but, giving them one last chance, the studio manager lets them do another song  which they deliver with much more passion and interest than their weak spiritual material. With a record under his belt Cash begins touring with many other rising rock and country stars as he begins a successful but storming personal and professional life.Without a great love for country music or for that matter biopics, Walk The Line took me some time to get round to seeing but when I did I was glad that I had because it is just simple a good film that rises above the genre. The film starts with formative moments from Cash's childhood and very quickly jumps through to adulthood, marriage and a dead-end job with no future or money. From here we know where the story is heading  even if some of the viewers may not know the specifics as they apply to Johnny Cash. So we have the career rise of Cash matched with his personal fall  much of his own making in regards women, drink and drugs. However this content is presented in a solid and engaging way because we care a lot about the characters and what is happening to them.Style-wise Mangold is relentlessly sturdy but never dull in his portrayal of the characters and he does well with the most important part  his actors. I do recall some questions being asked of the casting and for my money anytime Reese Witherspoon is cast I do ask questions myself. However the cast are roundly impressive and make their characters convincing and engaging. Phoenix is really good and he has great chemistry with Witherspoon, who is also excellent throughout. Robert Patrick was one of the few other faces I recognised and it made me realise that, for a 'big' film, there are hardly any established stars here and yet this never even occurred to me till after I finished watching the film. In terms of the musical numbers I'm not sure who was really singing and who wasn't but they are all really good and well filmed to be engaging and exciting.Walk the Line is a really good biopic and I know this because it engaged me as someone with little interest in Cash or his music. In regards narrative it ticks all the boxes that you know it will but yet still manages to make it interesting and never once was I thinking 'heard it all before'. Of course it also helps that both Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver really effective performances to draw the viewer into the characters from the start and throughout.",Null,5,5,22 June 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It is funny but lets not pretend it is clever or has any wider social importance than providing some laughs
","In Kazakhstan one of the leading television personalities is reporter Borat Sagdiyev, who has covered the leading events in his wonderful country. However with many backward ways in their land, the Ministry of Information decide to send Borat to America with producer Azamat and a film crew. Their aim is to learn lessons from the US in order to return to make benefit Kazakhstan. However when Borat sees the television show Baywatch in his hotel room he becomes transfixed with CJ, aka Pamela Anderson and convinces Azamat that the documentary should be a road trip across the US, thus allowing him to get to California and find his love.Hyped to the point of hysteria, I joined a packed Saturday night cinema to see this film, wondering what all the fuss was about. Before I continue it is important to note that I'm not trying to be part of a backlash or anything here, because I did actually find the film quite funny at times. However, while some professional reviewers have praised this for being a wonderfully intelligent commentary on society and so on, I struggled to see anything going on here past Jackass-style humour and lots of easy targets. To this end the film is at its funniest when we are simply laughing at what an outsider Borat is. Whether it is the imaginative ways that his narrow-minded ways manifest themselves (throwing money at bugs thinking they are shape-shifting Jews for example) or the looks on the faces of those people shocked by his behaviour, viewers not easily offended will find something to laugh about here.And to me that is where the whole show begins and ends. Viewers keen to find it will claim that Cohen is using Borat to bring out the small-mindedness of others by using Borat as a trap to draw them out. However this only actually happens twice; once is a redneck with homophobic and anti-Muslim views (a redneck, what a surprise) and the other is a group of drunk students  neither very difficult targets and neither groups that I would expect much of in this regard. Conversely most people show how civil they are by being polite for as long as they can before eventually decided that they can take it no more  the crowd at the rodeo is one example but I could also cite the dinner party, the feminists and so on. With this the case I did wonder what the point was and concluded that there isn't one  there is no intelligent commentary to be made here and those seeing it are seeing it perhaps to justify laughing at racist etc humour. Because lets be honest, that what is so funny right? That Borat is so out of touch and shocking in his views and the way he is. I know that was what made me laugh many of the times, not because it was racist etc but mostly because he is imaginative with how he is. Of course this is not to say that the humour is still not racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and so on, because it is and I know that some sections of any audience will be laughing at it because of this. Likewise I know some will be uncomfortable with the humour and not care that it is done in an ironic, knowing sort of way. I fell somewhere in the middle; it was funny but I wish it had been a damn sight cleverer to justify the material.Overall then this is a funny film but it really has very little beyond the Jackass approach of basically doing pranks (in this case Borat himself is the prank) on 'unsuspecting' people. It did draw laughs from me on this level but I was disappointed that it went for such easy targets and really didn't get much from any of them (some contributions are mere seconds). God only knows why it is so highly rated by my fellow users here but then that is why I give little or no credence to the top 250 list!",Null,20,36,23 November 2006
Alien 3," Good - but you probably expect more action
","Who wants to follow up one of the most successful sci-fi series ever?  David Fincher was not as famous or successful as he is now and definitely took a brave step in signing up for this.  Looking back on it with his other work in mind it is obvious that  he brought his own dark vision to the project.This was always going to suffer from comparisons with the previous two.  It suffered especially as the audience expected a gun-fest; an expectation rather stunted by the news that the film would be set on a prison planet and contain no guns.  What the film does do is put the alien back in the shadows and bring back some of the original's terror.Where the film fails is that it loses a lot of the excitement and tension of the others and replaces it with dull sections of the film and a lack of clear direction at times.  Despite keeping the excellent sub-plot of the evil military government the film does fall badly when viewed with the others.When you've got a series, changing it dramatically will only ever lose audience.  Here Fincher puts the alien back in the shadows and takes out all the gun-action to up the tension - he does a reasonable job but compared to Alien and Aliens this was never going to be much more than a disappointment. Of course it's still miles better than most sci-fi!",Null,5,16,17 October 2001
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Really too silly for its own good but fun and occasionally has good spark to it
","I quite enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes films, for all its limitations and irreverence it was pretty fun, so I was always going to return for the inevitable sequel. The good news is that the sequel sees everyone from the first film returning (albeit some of them only for a short time before being used as plot device), so I was hoping that the film would retain the strengths of the first, manage the slightly silly edge better and bring in Moriarty well. It doesn't quite manage to pull all of this off but it does have a decent enough stab at it, although it is unfortunate that the volume and the silliness appears to have been turned up from the first film.The silliness is the thing that bugged me the most here because there is a fine line between having a sense of comedic fun that enhances the story and action, and a sense of silly daftness that negatively affects the same. The first film got the balance pretty good and made for an entertaining romp, this sequel overdoes it a little bit and at times the comedy is too silly for too long to avoid doing damage to the sense of fun. The same happens with the slow-motion 'bullet time' effects – they are very nice touch but when they are used excessively they become less effective and a little bit part of the problem. Fortunately the majority of the film gets the sense of fun just right. The action is noisy but exciting and the lack of any sense of real danger or consequence is balanced out by the enjoyment of it all.The addition of Moriarty is handled pretty well. OK in a blockbuster such as this there was never going to be a real clash of minds but there is a sense of intellectual game-playing between them that works. In particular I thought Harris was very well cast and got his performance just right throughout. The same can't quite be said for Downey. I enjoyed him again here but he overplays too often and gets dangerously close to spilling over into 'Captain Jack' excess at times; not his fault totally perhaps but at times he is part of the 'silliness' setting in. Law isn't as good as in the first film, mainly because the material doesn't focus on the comic interplay between the two characters as much – it still happens, but it happens within bigger events rather than being something of its own. The loss of this detracted from the film to a certain extent. In terms of supporting cast I thought McAdams got a rather rough deal – not only used as a plot device but a plot device that wasn't required! The addition of Rapace is good although she maybe takes it a bit too seriously at times. Good to see the series keeping a link to the character of Lestrade as well, even though he is in it for seconds and no more. Watson's wife I could have done without while Stephen Fry was a good gag done too often.Overall then A Game of Shadows is perhaps too silly for its own good but it mostly manages to replicate the sense of fun that the first film had. The additions are mostly good and I will return for the third film (there almost certainly will be I imagine) but I do hope that they can prevent this series becoming Pirates of the Caribbean and instead focus on the core strengths that it has and play to those.",Null,4,7,26 December 2011
Gremlins," Silly but fun horror movie for teens with a mean streak running alongside the cartoon violence
","Billy's dad is an inventor and is always looking for cool presents for this son. So just before Christmas, when he finds a strange creature called a mogwai in a dark shop in Chinatown, he just has to have it despite the refusal of the owner. The rules for looking after the mogwai (who they rename Gizmo) are simple but an accident sees some water spilt on him, causing a handful more to reproduce from this one. Billy notices a difference between Gizmo and these new creatures but the full extent of the difference isn't clear until he mistakenly breaks the rule on feeding times and a whole new creature emerges.Criminally screened in the middle of the afternoon by Channel 4 recently (they edited out anything unsuitable for a daytime audience) this film is a lot of fun on many levels. At the start the film exists within an all-American small town with snow on the streets, a sense of community and white picket fences everywhere. It is a world that perhaps owes more to Spielberg more than director Dante but it is a world that the latter takes great pleasure in perverting once the film gets going in earnest. The plot is simple and straightforward, mostly relying on the build-to and delivery of the gremlins' antics and the attempts to stop them. In doing so it produces a great fun horror for older teens and adults. It funnier more than scary but it still manages to do the latter well enough to do the job for the younger element of the audience.The manic humour in the 'horror' is well done and it produces great energy throughout. For adults there is another element in the usual referencing from Dante. It is occasionally clumsy here but mostly it is unobtrusive and funny Â– Dante never seems to let the film main get away from him and keeps the dark tone going even when his action is a bit silly. The cast are very much secondary to the creatures and their antics (whether it be the cute Gizmo or the much more fun gremlins) and their performances reflect this. Galligan is average while Cates is quite nondescript. Support is OK from the likes of Axton, Feldman and Miller but mostly they are all second fiddle to the creatures.Overall though this is an enjoyable horror movie for younger audiences. It is very, very slightly scary as instead it is darkly funny during the violence. It is engaging even if it gets silly at times and the material is strong enough for an adult audience while also providing lots of film references for those that get them.",Null,14,28,4 January 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Not a brilliant film but a big enjoyable blockbuster without any pretensions to greatness
","Dr David Banner is hiding out in Brazil having fled the military unit led by General Ross who wish to study his genetic mutation and utilise it to create a race of super soldiers. Banner continues his studies into a possible cure for his condition with the discrete help of the mysterious scientist Mr Blue. A slip up in the bottling plant that Banner works alerts Ross to his presence and in goes a small unit led by Major Blonsky to tranquilise him and take him into custody. However when Blonsky and his men trap Banner in the plant, Banner's pulse races and soon Blonsky learns firsthand why Banner is such an important asset to Ross.The Incredible Hulk was sold as more of a blockbuster experience than the Ang Lee film was and from the very start this approach is laid out in the rapid back story in the credits. This continues across the whole film with some good sequences, comic book references for the fans and plenty of impressive special effects. What that does for you will depend on you but for my money it produced a solid summer blockbuster which is much like Iron Man in construction  ie it doesn't pretend to have 'substance' or complexity in the way the Batman franchise reboot does. Instead it is all about the basic blocks that make up the film and delivering those in a way that is fun without being too demanding or too complex. Hulk delivers on this and has plenty of good action that are greatly helped by the effects being very good indeed, with the decisions made about the look and size of the Hulk working to stop it being silly. Without a doubt it is a 'money up there on the screen' sort of affair.Having said that though, essentially this does mean that the film comes down to big computer effects hitting one another with New York City taking its traditional summer-time pasting and it did make me wonder about Norton's involvement. I respect him a lot as an actor and his scenes do appear to suggest that he sees more in the material than comes across on the screen. As it is he must have spent more of his time doing motion capture than doing on-screen acting and while his presence suggests that he has ideas of depth, nothing worthy of him is forthcoming. The opposite is true of Tyler, who is perfect for this material-light film but is not still that impressive. Roth was a strange bit of casting but he works in his character and is convincing in his transformation. Hurt and Nelson are both good additions who I assume more will come from. The cameos are not too obtrusive (although why can't Stan Lee do more of background cameo) and it is really hard for me to fault a film that gives a bit of time for Williams  who even in 'normal' clothes as he was here will always be Omar from The Wire.The Incredible Hulk is not a particularly dark or interesting film but, like Iron Man it is a fun and energetic comic-book film with good effects, good action and a general sense of good humour running through it. It won't blow you away outside of the realms of being a summer blockbuster but for what it does it is a perfectly enjoyable film.",Null,6,12,15 October 2008
The Monuments Men," Tonally and structurally fragmented
","It is easy to give marketing departments a hard time – for giving away too much in the credits or for showing the good bits or just for making a terrible film look good. In regard to this film, the marketing seems to be in the same boat as the viewer because it is really hard to know how to sell Monuments Men when the film itself seems not to know what it wants to do or be. The story is a true one, of an action to save works of art from being lost or destroyed as the Nazi's begin their retreat across Europe. As such there must be a good story in here somewhere but it is not really to be found here.The story it tells is all well and good but for some reason it is not particularly well structured as it has characters and actions split up without ever really making a good connection between them until later in the film and by then it is too little too late. The uneven story telling is one thing, but it is the uneven tone that is the bigger problem. At times it is somber, other times it wants to Ocean's WWII, then it is serious again, then it is comedic – it is not impossible to mix the content like this but it is hard to do and this film just feels like they were spinning a 'what type of film is this' wheel before shooting each scene.As the film doesn't work it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the starry cast are wasted – because frankly they are. Some of them don't know what film they are in, while some of them are playing it 100% certain what film they are in – it just happens to be a different one from other people. I'm not sure what went wrong with it, but it does flap around all over the place with Clooney seeming to be unable to get control of it. It doesn't help that it runs to almost 2 hours, because that is way too long for a film that doesn't work.There are moments in here and perhaps for some the interest in the real story may be enough to keep the interest, but for me I found it too consistently uneven in terms of its tone and its structure.",Null,0,2,24 May 2014
Antz," Great cartoon  get kids into Woody Allen early!
","Worker ant Z has issues - he feels insignificant and that he doesn't make a difference - and he's right.  As a worker ant he dreams of meeting the beautiful Princess Bala.  When he swaps places with Weaver, his military friend he becomes a hero in the termite war and goes on a search with Bala for Insectopia.  But with Bala gone, Sinister General Mandible has plans to take over the colony and wipe out all but the strongest ants, can Z be a hero again?I'm very much a Woody Allen fan, so straight away I'm a fan of this type of comedy.  The story is good for a child's comedy and it would stand up by itself.  The story is full of movie references (the `Starship Troopers' termite wars being the best), and is interesting enough to keep adults interested.  For children there are enough good visuals, action scenes and visual jokes to keep them happy.  But what really makes this film stand out is Allen's voice work.  He brings his style of humour to the film and is the perfect choice for the ant suffering from feelings of worthlessness and insignificance.  So many of the lines will go over the heads of children, but it is great to have this level of wit and humour in a kids film.The other thing that makes this stand out is the depth of the cast - and the fact that they are all good.  Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, John Mahoney, J-Lo, Sharon Stone (who Allen gave her first role to), and Sylvester Stallone (this is much better than the other Stone/Stallone feature `the Specialist').  The two other main roles are really well cast. Hackman is perfect as General Mandible while Walken is really well cast as Cutter - it's easy to see him in the animation.Overall this is an excellent film for adults and children.  A Bug's Life may be better for children because of it's brighter animation and greater reliance on visual humour, however Antz is by far the superior film.",Null,1,5,30 January 2002
Mission: Impossible III," Provides plenty of bangs for the buck but lacks tension or excitement beyond the superficial
","In an attempt to get closer to a 'normal' life, IMF Agent Ethan Hunt has stepped back from field work and into a training role. His fiancé is none-the-wiser and believes that he works with the local traffic commission, studying patterns and planning improvements. When he learns that one of his top pupils has gone silent in the field and is believed kidnapped, Hunt accepts the offer to lead a rescue team to extract her. The mission sees him coming directly into conflict with the elusive arms dealer Owen Davian.I didn't expect a great deal from the man that had given me Lost and Alias  both series that rely on forward motion to keep them going rather than doing anything in terms of depth or foundation. And so it was with MI3, because despite a few failed efforts to flesh out Hunt's life with a dog and a wife, the action is the all and we never go long without something going bang. Opening with a tense and engaging scene, the step back in time to Hunt's training role was a bit of a blow but it moved past quickly enough. The actual plot is then rolled out and despite being total nonsense from start to finish, is probably enough for those looking for summer thrills. Those looking for more (which, as a fan of the first MI film, I was) will probably not get it because generally the film eschews any detail or sense of intrigue and heads right for the action and spectacle. This has its merits of course but I must admit I wanted more than just that. As it was I let the noisy and shaky cameras bully me into submission and I found myself enjoying the film even I never doubted that it was quite an unremarkable film that attempts little of interest outside of the visual aspect.As director Abrams shows that he has an eye for movement and excitement but he mostly does it by artificial means as the material is not there to help him. It is not a great turn from him but he has certainly improved on the disappointing second film in the series. The cast are a strange mix but surprisingly nobody really makes much of an impression and they almost all come over like mere plastic models in one big special effects shot. Cruise does charming, driven, angry or determined as the story requires but other than that he lacks depth and in this film his charisma only got him so far for me. Hoffman is miscast although I can see why he accepted the role; he has good presence but the material he is given is below him and aside from one or two genuinely menacing scenes, he mostly just shouts. Rhames is so-so but the film doesn't do much with new crew members Maggie Q (who admittedly looked great) and Rhys-Meyers (who has a knack of grating on me in most of his performances, not sure why). Fishburne is an obvious red-herring; Monaghan is a non-person, unconvincing in the extreme and only there as a pretty narrative device. Simon Pegg was a very strange discovery and his version of Alias' Marshall didn't really work for me and didn't fit with the flow of the film.Overall then a noisy film that has plenty of running, shooting, shouting and bangs to make it fit the 'mindless summer blockbuster' gap at this time of the year. Those looking for more will probably have worked out that Abrams was not the man to give it to them, since hollow but engaging movement without substance is what he does best. The story just about hangs together and I did enjoy the noise but by the end I was longing for some actual, quiet tension and build-up, the like of which the film opened with promisingly but then never managed to deliver again.",Null,11,17,28 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Superficial but slick, engaging and fun regardless
","Slevin arrive in town and stops at his friend Nick's. Meeting his perky neighbour Lindsey, Slevin relates how he had his wallet stolen within minutes of arriving in town, an act which also involved getting his nose broken. While waiting for Nick, Slevin is picked up by two goons looking for Nick who have decided that he is indeed the man he claims not to be. He is taken to The Boss who decides he is Nick and thus owes him $96k  a debt he will cancel if 'Nick' kills the son of rival mobster The Rabbi. Later Slevin is also picked up by The Rabbi's men and taken to see him and so Slevin finds himself drawn into a game between the two bosses with a shadowy killer in the background.With the terrible (in my opinion) title, I didn't have great hopes for this but heard reasonably good things about it so one tired evening I decided to veg in front of it. From the deceptively slow opening, the film picks up with a good pace and energy that continues for the majority of the film. Ironically the film slows a little in the second half but by this point the energy has done its work and the plot developments have replaced them as the main hook. This is not to suggest that the plot is deep but it certainly is not, instead it is slick and fun. It helps if you can take your style with a hefty dose of violence but most modern viewers will get off on this updating of noir staples (dialogue, girls, twists, crime bosses) and delivers in a fresh-feeling package. The final sections (the reveal) are clunkier than the fresh majority would suggest.The direction suits the material and is done in a manner that brings out well, with McGuigan uses his camera and editors well, not to mention the cool set design and visual construct of the whole affair. Smilovic deserves credit as writer as his dialogue is fun and sparky while also building a nice solid mystery. Hartnett is great for the most part but when required to have depth in the later stages I found him a bit lacking. His time spent in a towel perhaps explains why my girlfriend enjoyed the film more than I did. Willis is a stiff presence but then that is the point and he does that well. Liu is wonderfully bubbly and I found her sexy and cool in contrast to her usual cold and unattractive performances  the film asks her to do little but she is fun. Freeman and Kingsley (sorry, 'Sir' Kingsley) are both class and quality support. The support cast features some nice touches from Tucci, Williamson and Missick.Overall then a very enjoyable caper film based on a good story that is good in the telling rather than the detail, with sparky dialogue and slick delivery. It is very superficial and will put off some for this reason but if you get caught up in the pace and energy earlier on it is actually a fresh and enjoyable, albeit in a modern and violent manner.",Null,3,7,11 December 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Great direction, great acting, great score, great script combine to produce a great film that is depressing but totally gripping even if it will not be to everyone's taste
","Harry and Tyrone are drug users who decide to try and make some money by cutting their cocaine and selling it on. This idea works very well and the pair start filling a shoe box with $20 bills  Harry even buys his mother, Sara, a television to make up for all the times that he used to steal her old one to sell it for cash. Sara has her won good news, after years of being an ordinary lonely widow she has the chance to appear on a television show herself and is actively dieting to try and fit into her favourite dress for it. With Harry's girlfriend pregnant but happily high, things take a bad turn when rival dealers start a war and dramatically cut the availability and up the price  forcing Harry and Tyrone to do whatever they can to get not only a fix but a supply to sell. Meanwhile, Sara's desire to lose weight sees her starting a regime of diet pills, morning, noon and night.I came to this film with not even the slightest idea of what it was about but only that it was supposed to be 'good'. I was not totally prepared for a story that grabbed me from the start and delivered an intense narrative at breakneck pace with great acting, amazingly stylish directing, editing and production. While this onslaught will not be to everyone's tastes, I defy pretty much anyone not to be astonished by this film although I expect many will find it to be a pretty hard ride. The story sees four characters each getting into addiction and having it cause their lives to spiral out of control  and that's pretty much it. However it is not so much the story but the telling because it is the delivery that makes the film as amazing and compelling as it is; I don't want to oversell it but all aspects of this film come together perfectly. The writing is realistic and, although not containing the speeches that make a cast shine, is really well written and never strikes a bum note. The script writes highs and lows of addiction so very well that it is easy to forget that what you see in the film has come from a script and story boards.Of course without the delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances. Burstyn is amazing  and I'm not overdoing that; hers is a fearless performance that is totally, totally convincing. Her descent is so tragic and involving that it is a major art of the story instead of the subplot it appeared it would be. Connelly is the next to stick in the mind, conveying a total peace and beauty when things are good but a terrible sweaty look of inner agony on her face as she degrades herself for drugs  an amazing performance. Leto is not someone I'm that aware of but he was good here and held his own well beside the two actresses. However the actual surprise of the film came from Wayans; I'm so used to hating him in lazy performances that I forgot he can act and he is good here  avoiding all the ethnic clichés that he usually does. McDonald is excellent in his cleverly used segments. It is easy to dismiss his performance as cheesy and easy but he does get it spot on (as the extras on the DVD show). Supporting roles for people of the recognisable likes of David, Baker, Weeks and Naidu only help.Of course the main impact of the film comes from the relentless direction that not only produces a stylish product but also draws the audience into the highs and lows the characters experience as well as the repetitive rituals of their lives. He also handles the hallucinations really well  making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly. I cannot describe it very well but the direction really hits the nail on the head with heavy style and different techniques. Of course, some may feel that they have seen elements of it before and will say of Aronofsky that he has borrowed much of what we see  certainly the front mounted camera on the characters harks back to Mean Streets and Spike Lee to name two, while others will look at the reference to Dark City (even though Aronofsky) or claim that the hyper direction is Trainspotting X10! However to accuse him of just stealing is lazy and nonsensical because he weaves it altogether for the whole running time; this is not a rip off or a fluke, this is a talented director spinning style and substance. The score by Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is perfect and is a wonderful compliment to the images, increasing their impact and making the film feel fast and exciting at times, tragic and moving at other times. These are just two examples but the film is technically impressive  whether it be the different cameras, the make up, the editing, the use of mobile stop motion, it is all impressive.Overall this is an amazing film but it is not one that will appeal to all audiences. It is bleak, relentless and a hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you and refuses to let you go until the very end. The film has a simple plot but a great script that is delivered by a collection of great performances  in particular from Burstyn and Connelly. The direction only adds to Aronofsky's reputation and the original score is fantastic. I am rarely left breathless by a film but I was by this one and I honestly cannot believe that this escaped me for so many years.",Null,125,149,10 October 2004
Your Name.," Perfectly balances all the elements, providing plenty in all of them (SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS)
","I came to Your Name only knowing that it was a body-swap film, and that it was supposed to be good. Beyond that I did not know much at all. I cannot remember if I was told it was a comedy, or merely assumed it was a comedy on the basis that all bodyswap films seem to play that element to the maximum. Regardless, I did not know much about it.The film opens very much in the genre that I expected, and we spend the first half of the film in this vein; two teenagers in different parts of Japan swap bodies every so often – a boy and girl. After a while it becomes a routine, and they leave each other notes on their telephones to help the visitor play out the lives correctly. In this half the film is lively, funny, sweet, and enjoyable for what it does with the characters in terms of establishing them but also swapping them around. The middle of the film sees a change to this direction, and instead the root of the jumping, and more detail of the situation, is laid out. At this point there is much more mystery, urgency, and drama to the story as it unfolds. It does this in a way that in no way discards what has gone before, but uses our charmed investment to make the second half work even better. It does this all the way to an ending which seems like nothing to describe it, but yet left me with tears in my eyes.The character creation and the spot-on judgment of tone are two key elements in making it work, but of course not only. Animation is great throughout and the music, although a little corny perhaps, plays off the emotions in the story well – again a factor in me having something in my eye at the end. I'm not sure a second watch will have quite the same impact on me as the first time did, but I will watch it again. It is a great little film – worthy of the praise it received on release in Europe, and worth watching even if you have zero interest in subtitled or animated films.",Null,3,5,12 November 2017
Captain Phillips," Tense and engaging even if a little longer than needed and perhaps 'Bayed' the ending in a way it didn't need to do
","Although it is basically a true story, I must be one of the few who did not know the ending already, since I had never heard this specific story. How much it matters if you already do or not I cannot say, but for me the film was not really about the resolution until near the end because for most of the time it is about the moment and what is going on there and then. It does this by breaking the story down pretty well into such contained but yet connected moments so that it is effective at the time and also has a flow to it.There are moments where it doesn't really keep that up – some of them it needs, but others it doesn't. In the tension and in the lulls, the film does well to keep things evenly balanced so that you don't completely turn against the Somalis as if they were generic baddies, but at the same time it never pushes anything down your throat about their situation. The one thing I was surprised that it came on strong about was the military response. I'm not sure if the film was trying to make a comment by playing it quite so 'Hollywood' at the end, but to me it did feel a bit odd in the film to have the music, camera-work and dialogue of a Michael Bay movie occurring in a situation where they were facing down a couple of guys with more feet than shoes. It still worked, don't get me wrong, but at the same time it had a generic feel to this aspect that I could have done without – particularly since earlier it seemed smarter than that.What helps it in these moments (and throughout) is that Hanks is great. He plays it out in a natural and convincing way, whether he is over- confident or in shock. Much has been made of Abdi's performance and I do see why, because it is frequently easy to forget that he is acting because he does seem quite real throughout. The supporting cast perhaps have fewer opportunities for nuance but they are still convincing and play their parts well, particularly those in the confines of the lift raft.Captain Phillips could have been a little shorter and been better for it and, while I don't totally see the film that others did, I did still enjoy it. It is tense and yet nuanced throughout, only really producing some aspects that don't work quite as well in the meantime.",Null,0,0,24 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," `A little less conversation a little more action'  a low point in the series
","The galaxy is run by the Republic, however they are under treat of a Rebellion run by the Trade Federation.  Sinister forces are also at work within both the Republic and the Federation and the Empire has it's hands in both in the form of Darth Sidious and his protégé Darth Maul.  Meanwhile Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and his pupil Obi Wan travel to protect the planet of Queen Amidala, along the way they find a child strong in the force and resolve to train up the child Anakin Skywalker in the ways of the Jedi.The first Star Wars movie (albeit number 4 in the production order) was always going to have a lot to live up to  after all we've been waiting for over 15 years!  Maybe that's why it was so poorly received.  The story isn't the most exciting thing due to the fact that it's setting up the coming films  the Empire is years away and is mostly in the background.  There's a lot of politics involved that make little sense and don't appear to go anywhere and this slows the film down.The film's focus is dull because the child Anakin is pretty innocent and cute  he is yet to have any hint of his future.  The action is quite cartoony and the ground battle at the end is as much reliant on slapstick comedy as it is on action.  In fairness to the film  it is less of an entity in itself and more of the stepping stone to the other films, it was never going to be the best of the lot  the best SHOULD be parts 3,4 and 5 as they are where the main action occurs (although we don't know what was planned for 7-9).  However that doesn't mean it shouldn't be good but it's bad in a number of ways.First of it totally lacks any sense of wonder or fun.  The effects may be better but the fun is gone, the characters are wooden and dry, the politics is dry etc.  Even when chased by a giant fish the Jedi remain unshakable  compare that to the action of Han Solo etc involved in a chase!  The characters are undeveloped and those that are created to be `fun' are actually annoying  namely Jar Jar Binks.  This `thing' is supposedly for children but he's just not funny.  If anything I find his `messa sorry' dialogue to be almost racist!  Could he have been made to sound more like a cotton-picking slave?  His slapstick antics aren't funny, they may amuse very young kids but compare him to the comedy of C3PO and R2D2  they were value for kids and adults alike and they weren't annoying!  To me the main concern is that it's just not fun  this only exists in a few good action scenes or a few comedy moments  but I wasn't enjoying it, I was only watching it.All the actors may be quality but they all treat the material with such respect that you'd think they were doing Shakespeare.  In part 2 they are still a bit dry but at least they get to have character and be a bit more life-like.  The only character that stood out was Darth Maul  even without any significant dialogue, at least he had passion and energyshame really!Overall this is just a stepping-stone to allow you to move on in the series. As a film it isn't enjoyable apart from a few scenes including the double-ended light sabre and the pod-race.  Happily Lucas put much of the faults right for part 2 but really as a film Part 1 is a disappointment.",Null,22,40,27 June 2002
Sucker Punch," Not as awful as you have heard but just empty, noisy, pointless, heartless and cynically commercial
","Of course I had heard all the negative reviews when I sat to watch this. Of course I had seen the MTV-friendly action trailer. But critics can be biased and marketing can be misleading, so I decided to give this a go. On the face of it this film could have been similar to Pan's Labyrinth in regards the idea of a young girl/woman living through hardship and extending that hardship into a fantasy world of demons and otherworldly creatures. Certainly after watching the first very stylish fifteen minutes this felt like a film that would take this foundation of abuse and deep physiological injury and do something exciting, interesting and clever with it – at least, that's how it felt it could have been.The problem is that, despite setting up these themes, the film does nothing with them – nothing at all. The dual fantasy sequences do not connect to any of the ideas or possible themes but rather represent an action sequence in the place of a (often mundane) aspect of the girl's plan to escape the burlesque house (which itself is a fantasy version of the mental institution). So for example when Babydoll dances to distract the mayor to allow the others to pickpocket a cigarette lighter , we cut away to a sequence of the girls raiding a castle to kill a dragon and steal the crystals that make it breathe fire. It might as well be a different film in these action sequences, and indeed they are – but the problem is that these sequences seem to be the film that Snyder wanted to make.In fairness these massively dumb action sequences are full of style and presentation with impressive effects. They work for what they are and, even though the slow-mo, use of music and overall design is derivative, it does still provide plenty of style. But they aren't connected to anything in the film and this means that they have the same effect as they do in the trailer – 'oh, that's fancy' but nothing more. There is no heart to them and as such these parts of the film are nothing more than another blockbuster with loads of effects but nothing else.The lack of anything else is what kills the film because by the halfway point the empty noise becomes nothing more than noise. It is not even that it fails to make something of the ideas, characters and story – it is that it simply has no desire to do anything with them – like it is happy to be nothing. This annoyed me and it gets worse as the ending of the film attempts to suddenly have a darkness, to have a heart – it is too little too late and it doesn't work. In the absence of ideas to interest the viewer, one is left to think about other things. The exploitative fetishism of school-girl outfits, guns, sexuality and violence is one such thing I thought about – particularly since it was in a film whose final lines of dialogue appear to lift up the women characters. The sexual costumes and imagery do nothing of the sort but there is not some underlying misogyny as some have claimed – it is simply another part of Synder making his film as emptily commercial as possible, and sexy young women being sexy sells – just as gun porn and special effects sell. The cast match this as well – occasionally they look like they could have delivered more but ultimately they are little more than sexual effects. Browning, Cornish and Malone have a bit of heart to them but Hudgens and Chung are just flesh (not that I minded too much). This is not a film that cares about its cast – and the audience won't either.Sucker Punch is not as awful as you have heard – it is too expensive and stylish for that. No, it is just poor because it simply does nothing other than empty, heartless style that is noisy and pointless. The ideas and themes go nowhere and the film has no interest in them or the characters. All that matters is slow-motion, cool music, big action and comic book style – if that is all you want without caring about any of it then this will fill your ears and eyes for a while – but if you want more then best give this a miss.",Null,23,47,7 July 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," Good in the moment even if not hugely satisfying overall
","Like the film Cloverfield, I only heard of this film from a trailer seen recently, and decided to give it a go despite knowing very little about it. This is how the film wants it, and how it works best; it does this itself from the start where we learn a little about Michelle but there join her in her disarray and unknown circumstances. Not knowing the picture outside the bunker or really inside it either, means that mostly you are intrigued by either. The use of music and direction within the bunker does owe a lot to Lost – in particular its juxtaposition of dated domesticity against a bigger picture of unknown dangers (maybe) – and it does work even if it is a bit familiar.Mostly though it is the performances that make it work. Winstead and Gallagher are solidly convincing, but it is Goodman that feeds the tension. The old adage 'just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you' applies here, and his character is unsettling in the detail. The inner and outer stories don't totally satisfy in their specifics and their end-points, however just as the trailer works to hook you in, the film is good in any specific moment. Unfortunately those moments don't all work as well as one another, and they don't come together into a satisfying whole as you may wish.In the end it does have the feeling of a well-constructed product, which benefits from smart casting, writing, production, and marketing – but not necessarily story-telling. It was still entertaining as I watched it, but it didn't really leave a lasting mark, and it isn't really inspiring a second viewing now that I know what it holds",Null,2,4,2 July 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Doesn't totally play to all its potential strengths but is still a very good modern western with solid delivery across the board
","Dan Evans is a struggling rancher being pushed off his land by men he dare not stand up to. An amputee from his part in the war, Evans longs for the respect of his sons, but all they see is his refusal to take up arms for his land. Evans is in town to try and reason with the landowner for more time to pay off his debts when he stumbles across outlaw Ben Wade in a bar with his guard down. Wade is captured and a posse is put together to transport Wade while a decoy draws off his gang. With the money and the moral aspect, Evans joins the posse and sets out, with the time pressure on them from the very start.I missed this film at the cinema but I did want to see it as I had greatly enjoyed the original and had indeed commented in that review that the film would work if done well in any setting, so I figured the remake could work as well. The simplicity attracted me to the original and this remake, for all its Hollywood production values, is still a solid and simple tale. The heart of the film is the battle between good and evil as it occurs both between Evans and Wade but also within Evans himself. This comes out best in the final scenes (the waiting for the train is a smaller part of the film than the original) and it did make me wish that more had been made of this. However, what makes up the majority of the film does still mine this theme, albeit not as effectively because of the sense of space and action tending to take away from the pressure cooker of the hotel room with the ticking clock.IMDb currently has this within the top 250 films ever made, which needless to say I disagree with but will say that it is a strong modern western and a very engaging film all round. Director Mangold does a sterling job of keeping the material the focus and succeeds in making the climax very tense, even if he cannot drag it across the whole film. I did like the way that the film is restrained in regards the cinematography; too often westerns will feel obligated to have sweeping landscapes and make the most of them just because it is what the genre does. Here though the locations are impressive without ever being forced onto the viewer as if they were the focus  Mangold and his crew keep the focus tighter and the characters don't get lost in wide shots.The cast is one of the main draws for the modern viewer, with the star pairing being a big selling point. Crowe is a solid Wade but I never felt like he was doing more than playing the character rather than totally being it. Bale on the other hand is much more convincing and this did make it work very well. The two men do play off one another really well and again it just added to my desire that the film had allowed them more time with just the two of them and a ticking clock. Lerman is a device character but he works well within the demands of the script. Foster enjoys a simple but memorable character by being simply evil throughout. Support is solid as well with some good turns from people such as Mol, Fonda and others.Overall then a solid and enjoyable western. The things that made the original so strong are not quite as well delivered here but they are still present, with strong delivery across all aspects making for a very good, but not brilliant film.",Null,4,8,23 April 2008
Ali," Entertaining biopic but is overlong and is unsure of itself when it tries to delve below the surface
","By joining the young Cassius Clay as he first makes his mark on the world of boxing and finishing the film before a sentimental and unnecessary look at Ali struggling with his illness, Mann makes this a much better film than it could have been, even if he doesn't full off a great biopic. The plot follows him through his best years and highest profile troubles and is an entertaining look back at this chapter in this life but the focus is on the facts rather than anything really deeper. Like Ali himself, the film is at its best when it is floating, boxing and trash talking and in these moments it is great fun  but not because the film is anything special but because Ali was. However when the film has to delve deeper into him as a person, it seems less certain of itself and is surprisingly dull. Issues that require a sensitive touch fall flat and, although the film does show him in a bad light, it is mostly done reluctantly and sheepishly.The running time is longer than necessary to accommodate this side of things and, because it doesn't work that well it does make the whole film feel longer than it should be. The fights and talking are where the show is though and it does this aspect really well. The fights are well directed and convincing, doing justice to the real things and they are fun to watch. In these scenes I was happy to have Mann as the director but I couldn't wonder but wonder if Spike Lee would have been a more interesting choice for the depth and review of the man as a person and on his cultural impact. Matching the film's strength in recreation, the cast is led by a couple of performances that are very good but really very good impersonations. Smith never makes Ali his own and never gets below the skin of the character. He is great in the ring and he trash talks really well but he is part of the problem when it comes to the other stuff. Voight does great work as Cosell; I barely recognised him and he has gotten the mannerisms and voice bang on. The support is very mixed but is mainly good. Foxx impresses in a minor role and I imagine it is this performance that won him the support in Mann's Collateral. The rest a re a strange mix with too many of them being recognisable from other films and undermining their characters  with such little time to make an impact, many of them are 'that guy from' rather than being the person we need them to be. The limited pool of actors that Mann drew on also caused me some amusement; specifically it was amusing to see Hall go from being Baines in Malcolm X to being Elijah Muhammad (a promotion) or Esposito not shooting Malcolm X. Nobody is bad but I did think that the cast would have benefited from having fewer famous faces despite the fact that Silver, Wright, Williamson, Smith, Gaye, Michele, Morton, McGill and others were all fine (not sure about Van Peebles as Malcolm X or Williamson's Don King though).Overall this is a good film but it is at its best when it is just recreating the magic of Ali and his skills as a fighter and entertainer. When it tries to go below the surface it falters and does occasionally drag. One thing worth noting is that the very things that the film does well is captured just as well in the (much shorter) documentary When We Were Kings, that covers the same sort of ground but uses the man himself.",Null,3,5,2 October 2005
The Expendables 2," Distracting excess but mostly lacks actual excitement or reasons to be engaged
","I do enjoy a good action movie – indeed if I'm honest I also enjoy an average action movie as long as there is lots of noise and action throughout. This was the reason i came back for the Expendables movie even though I had no real expectations of it being any good – at very least I knew that things would explode and that the film would exist in the fantasy world of macho 80's style action movies. The opening scene of the film does leave you in no doubt as to what you are getting, as the team rescue someone from the heart of a fortified town, killing probably hundreds in the first 15 minutes alone. It isn't thrilling but it is very loud and enjoyable for what it is.Sadly it cannot just keep doing this and at some point the characters need to talk and a rough plot needs to come out. At this point the film really grinds to a halt because none of the dialogue actually works particularly well. It tends to come in one of two forms, the most painful of which is the vague attempts at depth or character. These lines tend to be said by a grave-side, in the quiet moments when the odds look bad or in other reflective moments; I think one line actually worked but generally they are corny as hell and clunk across the screen – at best some of them are just misjudged for the tone of the film or the scene. The other dialogue tends to be jokey banter but, although it is occasionally amusing in its obviousness, this doesn't work either because it always feels scripted right down to the letter. The delivery doesn't help but the writing seems to be all about making as many references to the star's other films as possible – not making them clever references, but just making them out loud. Even when it is just banter without the references, it doesn't feel natural and it doesn't have much spark to it. Fortunately this does still leave the action sequences.The action is mostly noisy, OTT and silly but it works as such, causing mayhem and having large action stars being indestructible in the way that they used to in the 80's. Problem is that there is a reason why those films had to change over time, because it is hard to really build tension and excitement when your stars are unstoppable and the action is very much 'A-Team with blood'. As seen here, the action doesn't thrill because it doesn't change too much and doesn't provide much in the way of creativity or actual danger being posed to the characters. There are some exceptions but these are few and far between – Jet Li's group fight early on was enjoyable for him being given the space to work, while Stallone and Van Damme's head-to-head is fun even if it isn't as good as it could have been and doesn't do quite as much as I would have liked.Just as he helps that final fight though, Van Damme does help the cast and makes a great villain. I am not sure why the film gave him so little to do but he makes an impact with little time as he is colourful and crazy. Of the rest it is variable but generally tends towards the obvious. Stallone is fairly hard to understand and has no range here – not sure what he is trying to do but he can't find a character of interest and he doesn't do much for the fun aspect. Statham on the other side does a great job again by playing to his strengths of humour and physical ability – like Li in that regard, he gets to do what works for him. Crews, Lundgren and Couture are so-so while Norris, Schwarzenegger and Willis are there for their names more than anything else. The addition of Yu could have made some difference but mainly she is given terrible 'fawning' material with Stallone which is badly done.Expendables 2 is not an awful film if you come to it to get the thing it offers – mindless OTT action in a very basic mould. As such I quite enjoyed it but it would have been much better to actually care about it or be thrilled by it – as such it is a real basic action movie that only stands out from the straight-to-video market by virtue of the stars involved.",Null,3,4,3 December 2012
Source Code," Has its wobbles but is engaging and entertaining right up to a slightly disappointing ending (SPOILERS)
","Quite often concept films don't quite live up to their potential. Films that have a great concept at their core but yet cannot make that one idea into a fully functioning film. Setting aside a few stutters, Source Code is not one of those films as it draws the viewer in with threads that engage in the present and also the past. The plot is relatively simple – a soldier in a test programme gets to relive the final 8 minutes of someone else's life as many times as he wishes; these 8 minutes end with a terrorist attack on a train and, while he cannot do anything to save those on the train, he can use that time to identify the bomber so that he can be caught in the present.Source Code is clever and yet also simple at the same time. Like a lot of good sci-fi it is build on ideas but doesn't forget the people. While on the train it manages to deliver tension and a palatable sense of a race against time as Stevens battles his confusion and desire to save the train, in theory the restricted place and time should get repetitive but it builds in enough in the present to inform and vary the past and make it slicker, more engaging and, of course, has less carrying to do in terms of the whole movie. The linkage to the present is good and the plot unfolds there well in a way that also got me to care about what was going on with the characters. Both aspects move along very well and it becomes clear that, while director Jones may seem to like a good idea, he also knows how to direct action.The final ending seemed like a little bit of a cop-out. There was a sense of emotional buy-in for me in the train and I felt the final scene or two took away from it – it was not that I didn't get the idea that each jump into the source code doesn't just relive the reality, but actually allows for another reality to be created. I won't say it makes any sense, but I understand what the film did with it. Problem for me was not the understanding so much as it was the feeling; regardless of your interpretation of the ending, it ultimately seems to be there to give a positive ending in regards the main characters whereas a much stronger ending would have been his wish being fulfilled (death) and leave it at that. It did sour the movie for me a little bit and it felt like one of those endings that a test audience came up with (even though it isn't).A large part of it working is Gyllenhaal. He is a great presence in this film and he made me interested in him in all the scenes, whether he was coming to terms with the reality of his situation, or racing around the train – he got his character and it made it easy for me to care. Outside of him the support cast are a little bit secondary but are still good. Monaghan, Farmiga, Wright are all solid and interact with him well, but Gyllenhaal is the star of the show here no doubt.Source Code may have a few wobbles and appear to bottle it when it comes to delivering the logical but downbeat conclusion the film deserved, but it is still a very good film. The concept is well laid out and the details aren't allowed to bog the action down – action, which is complimented by the characters being good and thus getting me to buy into them and their story. It has room for improvement, but Source Code is still an engaging and enjoyable sci-fi that remembers that it is about people, not the science.",Null,1,5,24 July 2011
Skyfall," A little more serious than it warrants at times but generally engaging Bond thanks to the talents of those involved (SPOILERS)
","When I saw the previous Bond film (Quantum of Solace) I did quite like the more serious edge to it, but remember feeling like the bits between the action were still only the bits between the action and that none of it really amounted to much. With Skyfall this direction has been taken further and we end up with a film that is surprisingly light on action and heavy on thematic content. Neither of these things work quite as well as I would have hoped but generally it makes for a much more serious Bond film with some interesting things going on.I say it doesn't totally work though because, in my view it doesn't; there is an odd lack of impact with the action sequences and there is an odd lack of satisfaction from the film as a whole – even as I enjoyed it I was surprised by how infrequently it thrilled me as a film. Opening with a punchy action sequence that leads into a visually strong title sequence, the film then slows down a little to focus on M as much as on anyone else. Her decisions, her mistakes and the consequences of both are key to the film and it was a theme I liked a great deal; there is a lot around this in dialogue and also in the characters (with the most obvious being the motivation of the villain). While the damage done to him by M is key to the plot, the damage done to Bond is also a constant through the plot, with the two men very close in some aspects. There is a lot of meat here although it must be said that, while serious, the film doesn't totally make the most of it and I would have liked more dialogue sequences like the couple delivered in the first meeting between Bond and Silva, and between Silva and M. At times the film doesn't make the most of it and as a result it seems serious and slow for the sake of it, rather than it really being rewarding as such.In combination with this serious air, the action seemed pared down in terms of bravado and fun; I liked the serious air that has come to the films with Craig's tenure but I would have liked a bit more of the type of action we saw in the opening sequence. There is still plenty to enjoy but some of the action lacks spark and I can understand those who see the conclusion of the film to be a bit of a weak affair in terms of payoff (although personally I liked it). It doesn't help that some of the writing is poor when it comes to events – the ability of Silva to have planned for everything (for example, the exact chamber where Bond would catch up to him in the underground) is generally just ignored while other leaps (Bond's survival, recovery and return doesn't get any context at all) are just written off as the cost of doing business; in Moore's Bond perhaps these would be less important, but in this more serious film such convenience stands out.The film still works though and in a bit part it is down to the talents of those involved. Although more could have been done with it, Craig, Dench and Bardem all make the most of the themes. Craig is best when struggling and he makes for an engaging Bond. Dench seems to appreciate the material to be more than just a supporting character and she does very well, but it is Bardem for me who really makes the film. His performance delivers on the serious content while also providing a cold yet camp menace throughout and he is able to bring the mental damage and rage through frequently. He is a great character and, while the serious tone occasionally makes the others seem a bit stiff, he is never affected by this. Harris is not as well used as I would have liked and doesn't fit that well, but Marlohe is enjoyably tragic. Fiennes is a good addition too. This acting talent is reflected technically too; I'm not totally sold on Mendes as the director here, but Deakins as cinematography is a great move because the film looks great from start to finish whether it is the dull atmosphere of a small Scottish church, or the neon confusion of a fight in a Shanghai tower block; I don't know who edited but this is also strong and makes the most of the visuals.Skyfall is a strong Bond film though. It steps further from the gadgets and silliness of the franchise than any other film and it mostly makes it work thanks to the abilities of those involved. Some of the writing isn't as good as the tone of the film suggests and some of the action is less exciting than it should have been, but it still works. Not the crowd-pleasing Bond that many will be looking for, but a stronger and more interesting film for it.",Null,4,22,10 November 2012
50 First Dates," Sandler fans may like it but generally it is weak and not particularly funny
","As unlikely as it may seem, Henry Roth is a wow with the ladies and living on a tropical island means he gets to have short relationships with many beautiful tourists who are there for only a short time. This has bred a fear of commitment into him but a chance meeting with the beautiful local Lucy threatens to change that. They share a breakfast and Henry is smitten, agreeing to meet up the next day. However the next day she has no memory of him and he finds that he has to win her over again and again.In fairness to Adam Sandler he is not to blame for me not really liking this film. You see he made it clear from the very first scenes that this was going to be a film just like all his other films, with the same slightly crude and childish sense of humour and the same broad and basic approach to plotting and character development. In a way it is the same as putting a warning sign on an electrical panel to make sure that you don't go into unless you know you can deal with it. And so it is here with a film that relies on crude characters, cute kids and animals to get laughs and seems totally at sea when asked to deliver anything other than the most simplistic and formulaic of emotions. The plot awkwardly mishandles the central concept so that it is never convincing even on the very simple level that the script needs it to be.For fans of Sandler though there are laughs to be had. Personally I didn't laugh more than once or twice but others may find it differently. That said though, I was surprised by how much the clunky plot took away the scope for the usual laughs and it was noticeable. Sandler plays the same character he always play with the same performance he always does. I found it hard to believe he could get all these women but he suits the material I suppose. Barrymore is stuck with a hopeless task. She needs to bring out feeling and pain in her character to make it work but she is in a film where this doesn't really matter and when she tries it, she is actually taking away from what the film is trying to do. Schneider does his usual stuff; he is crude and amusing but it is hardly wit. Astin's character is great fun and he works it well although why Dan Aykroyd bothered is beyond me.Overall then a fairly basic and obvious film. If you like even the weaker Adam Sandler films then you will like this but otherwise you should probably just avoid because it is nothing different from his usual stuff and does as little as you expect it to do.",Null,5,11,15 March 2007
Catch Me If You Can," Slick and enjoyable story telling
","When his parents file for divorce and he has to chose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jnr runs away from home.  He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse.  Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques.  As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.Based on a true story, although it doesn't rely on `and it really happened' to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation.  The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale.  It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to.  It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.The presentation is good.  Williams' score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick.  Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period.  The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn't fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth.  But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn't set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.The cast is good even if they aren't all used well.  If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I'll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I'm not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy.  Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio.  Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.  If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the past two hours!",Null,76,103,25 December 2003
The Hangover," Funny but not as hilarious as some would have you believe
","I got to The Hangover after everyone else had already seen it, told me how brilliant it was, told me their favourite 'bit' and told me to get around to going to see it. Having been burnt many times before though, I did not let this praise make me have any grand expectations and I came to it just hoping that it would be funny. And it was. I had some good laughs and plenty of chuckles throughout the film – enough to enjoy it right through from the setup to the pictures over the end credits. Whether I would be able to enjoy it for a second viewing though I'm not so sure.The reason for this is that many of the laughs came from the sudden nature of the comedy – whether it be a sudden physical act or the unexpected nature of a line. It is a slightly childish type of comedy with lots of people getting hurt in funny ways and this only has so much of an appeal to me. Like the Oriental gambler says, 'it's funny because he's fat' and that does rather sum up why some of the film is funny. This is not to take away from some of the very funny lines and scenarios that the film comes up with, but I still did think that the majority of my laughs would be dissipated if I had known what was coming (as I would with a second viewing). The flow of the story works a little bit against it as well. In some regards it has a good 'mystery' structure to it but then again the central concept means that in too many scenes we have to listen to a character explain that they have no memory etc etc. Fortunately it is mostly funny enough to cover up this clunky repeated problem.The cast really help the comedy by their delivery. Although he is not really that well known in the UK (The Office US not being a big show here) Helms was the standout for me. In a character with elements of his Andy in there, I found him very funny and with a great sense of timing. Galifianakis is pretty good as well, although he has a simpler character in many ways. Cooper is not quite as good with the comedy but he is a good presence in the film and plays off the others (particularly Helms) well. The various comic characters in support include mostly funny turns from Graham, Jeong, Riggle and of course Mike Tyson.In summary, The Hangover will be loved by the majority of the target audience but is fast-paced and funny enough to please the casual viewer. It may not stand up to repeat viewings due to the nature of some of the laughs but it good fun without too much reliance on crudity or basic pratfalls.",Null,7,14,24 November 2009
Iron Man 3," Entertaining blockbuster with good mix of dark edge, comedy and action
","The superhero blockbuster is a very crowded field and generally one that I now avoid in the cinemas as too often they are not good enough to justify the effort; on DVD at home though, expectations are lower and perhaps they work better even though you lose something of the big screen experience. The Marvel films generally have been the better ones in terms of producing an engaging spectacle which thrills while it makes you laugh and generally encourages you to go along with the plot even though it is very much the stuff of fantasy. If it sounds and looks easy then one just needs to look at the many lesser films that are just a mess of CGI and emptiness.This film sees Stark shut off and struggling with the mental fall-out of The Avengers film and at the same time a terrorist known as The Mandarin is staging attacks globally, building his threats directly at the US President. The plot here is quite a balancing act but it is one that it mostly pulls off. It needs there to be darker moments but for the comedy to still work; it needs there to be a serious 'real world consequences' plot but for it to still work within the world of fantasy characters. It gets this balance mostly right and I found the film to have a good dark edge to it while ultimately still being funny and having an entertaining flow to it. Some inclusions don't work and the villains do feel like a bit of X-files at work, but in terms of providing action, thrills and entertainment, it does a very good job.The cast do well but of course the film is Downey Jr's and he does it well despite having more to deliver. His conflicting comedy arrogance and haunted-psyche works pretty, mostly because of his presence and delivery. Paltrow is so-so and she doesn't have many times to mix chemistry with the star. Pearce is OK but not given enough time to justify his character but Kingsley is fun in all the different ways he is asked to deliver! Hall, Cheadle, Dale, Sadler and Favreau all give good support but the latter does feel a bit unnecessary.It is still a summer blockbuster, so your sights should be set accordingly, but it is a good one in that it delivers robust entertainment across the board with a nicely dark tone complimenting effects, action sequences and comedy.",Null,10,21,25 August 2013
The Ring," A good scary film  but please watch Ringu to see how good it SHOULD be
","A rumour is going around about a video tape that may have some sort of killer virus on it.  Anyone who watches it dies mysteriously seven days later.  Naturally disbelieving the whole nonsense, journalist Rachel Keller decides to investigate further when a relative of hers supposedly views the tape and dies seven days later.  She finds the tape and watches it, enlisting the help of video expert Noah to help her uncover where the tape was made.  Can she solve the tape's secrets before 7 days are up?OK.  It's important to know where a reviewers bench mark is before you judge where they are coming from.  So let me say that I saw Ringu a year back and it really freaked me out.  So as you can imagine I came to this half expecting it to be a rubbish remake of a film that I didn't see any need to remake.  However it was better than I had feared and probably will stand out as one of the best horror movies of 2003 (when it is released in the UK). The plot has changed slightly from the original but not really to the detriment of the film  it actually helps it be more modern and more believable now that it's in America.The film's main problem for me was the fact that it went for the `jump scares' rather than `creepy scares' which Ringu had.  Here we have more sudden movements where Ringu moved slowly and deliberately.  Ring does this well at points too, but for most it will always go for the jump rather than the unnerving creep.  However I defy anyone not to get a little creeped out by the remake as well.  If I hadn't seen Ringu I know I would have enjoyed this more  but I only kept remembering how well it was done in the first place.  For example THAT scene (viewers will know what I mean) is too quick and too jumpy in Ring whereas in Ringu it was slow, deliberate and terrifying in it's sheer unnerving horror.  Likewise in ring we see the child'' face a lot more which detracts from the fear of the unknown  in Ringu it was more of the long hair.The performances are not as good as Ringu in some respects.  Watts is very good and is believably scared.  Henderson is OK but I wanted a more mature man rather than a surfer-dude type.  The support cast were all good, with Brian Cox thrown into the mix.  My only pause for concern was Dorfman  why was he allowed to change the character of the boy? In Ringu he was a normal kid, here he comes across like a poor man's Haley Joel Osmond in 6th Sense? His routine took away from the emotional involvement that should have come with the danger he was in  instead he just comes across as difficult.  The performance is OK but 1, the change to the character is strange and unnecessary and 2, it just felt a little too like the 6th Sense!Overall I enjoyed the film and was scared at some points.  However too often it went for the jump rather than just being consistently unnerving as Ringu was.  Fans of Ringu may dislike this but I think those who haven't seen the original will enjoy this.  Word of advice though  go out and find a copy of the original and watch it first, you'll enjoy it a lot more and it'll show you why Hollywood fell over themselves to try and copy it in a more commercial way.",Null,72,131,24 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic bit of schoolboy action
","In the run up to WW2 Professor Jones is approached by US Intelligence to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant in order to stop it falling into the hands of the Nazi's.  With bar owner Marion in tow, Indiana takes on Nazi's across the globe to recover the ark.The story is pure Saturday morning hokum, but its all shined up with a great deal of professionalism and you don't notice.  The main strength is the tremendous sense of fun in the film - not only is it funny but the huge action scenes are all edge of the seat stuff that are hugely enjoyable to watch.  Be it the opening set piece, the truck chase, the fight around a burning airplane, the chase for a basket or the gory finish - it's all great fun to watch.The performances are pretty cardboard and stereotype - evil Nazi's et al. but it barely matters.  Ford is great - this is the type of undemanding hero type that he thrives on.  The rest of the cast are good - Freeman and Kahler stand out with their characters.  If it has any weaknesses then the lack of characterisation and plotting are the main suspects but I really think the flaws are greatly outweighed by strengths.Overall a good action film for older families.  With an old fashioned feel, a great sense of fun, plenty of laughs and fantastic action scenes this deserves all the good reviews it gets.",Null,13,20,14 January 2002
United 93," By turns it is interesting and moving and is well worth seeing
","In near real time and using accounts and officials records of the day, Paul Greengrass delivers an account of the events surrounding the terrorist attack on 11/9/06, focusing on the aviation authorities, the military and the passengers of the only plane that did not reach its target  United flight 93. By doing this he was one of the first to make a film (as opposed to a documentary) that recreates the day. That said though, Greengrass' approach might as well be a documentary as it is very much a recreation as opposed to being a movie in the way Oliver Stone's film was.Having done Bloody Sunday, I was happy that this had been put in his hands and I hoped he could do a good job. Although it certainly cannot be described as a fun experience, it is a great film in the way it coldly and convincingly does what it sets out to do  deliver a recreation. He doesn't try to manipulate the audience with cheap sentiment and he doesn't overplay the horror of the day. He also wisely avoids any questioning of why what happened and has no interest in conspiracy theories, mainly because few of us did as the day unfolded. Some viewers will complain about his shaky camera but for me I liked the way it kept moving, catching me up in the confusion on the ground and the fear on the plane.The film makes very good use of official reports on the ground and does a good job of recreating the scenes on flight 93. Only a French (or at least a French accented) passenger trying to convince the other passengers to sit tight and just do what the hijackers want was a bum note for me  I'm not sure, maybe it was factually accurate but it felt like a cheap shot and it was not up to the standard of the rest of the film. The lack of any (for me) recognisable faces in the cast was a very good move as it took away anything that would distract. The cast of unknowns all work well together and are very convincing in their various roles; there are one or two so-so performances but few of these are key performances and are covered over easily enough.The events themselves are still moving and it is easy to be caught up in them  the majority of the first half of the film is fascinating as you get a sense of the response on the ground, but the second half is gutting due to the very real sense of fear and desperation in the plane. Reviewers were concerned that this was 'too soon' and I recall the internet having a buzz of dissension about the film but in reality Greengrass has delivered a strong recreation with a strong factual basis that just allows the events to speak for themselves right down to the very matter of fact way the film ends. By turns it is interesting and moving and is well worth seeing.",Null,5,9,22 December 2006
Deja Vu," Fails to convince in its central concept but still has some good moments
","A car bomb destroys a loaded ferry on its way to Mardi Gras celebrations, killing hundreds in a terrorist attack. ATF agent Doug Carlin impresses his peers in the early stages of the investigation and is brought onto a select team by FBI Agent Pryzwarra. The aim of the team is to review surveillance footage from about four and a half days before the incident. Carlin quickly smells a rat and is told that the footage is actually made possible by a loop in time and is essentially a live feed from the past. With the murder of Claire Kuchever their only lead, the team start to follow her movements in the lead up to the attack; but can Carlin stay remote from his subjects when they seem so alive in front of him?It is no wonder that the trailer struggled to sell the high concept that this film is built around because the film itself really struggles with it. I'm not even sure where the writers started when coming up with this idea because, although it does have nice touches, it is generally very messy and nonsensical. It is not necessarily a problem in the idea itself but rather in the delivery. Is the central concept in The Matrix (for example) less silly? Well no, but it convinces within the universe created by the film. However with Déjà Vu this is not true and it doesn't manage to sell the idea to the viewer, with nothing really being constant within it and the concept conveniently drifting to help the plot. The problem with this is that it then gets in the way of what is otherwise a perfectly serviceable run-of-the-mill thriller coming out of the Hollywood machine (I don't mean this as a criticise but just an acknowledgement of what it is).As a result it doesn't flow as well as it should because the shaky foundation it is built on keeps on rearing its head. Individual moments are professionally and slickly done to the point that you forget the bigger picture and lose yourself in the moment (Fox's 24 gets by on this same idea of momentum keeping you questioning the past too much) but this doesn't last and soon you can't help but look around you and be unsure.Is it a bad film though? Well, no, it is actually OK but nothing more than that. Scott does all he can be expected to do with the material and he injects as much style and energy into it as he can and does produce a good thriller  albeit a good thriller build on a very, very weak foundation. Washington is a strong presence and he relies heavily on that  turning in an OK but entirely predictable performance. Patton is pretty but struggles to build a character with her position in the film  it doesn't help that the makers decided that she has more value naked in an unnecessary shower scene. Kilmer is solid enough, as are Greenwood, Alexander and Goldberg. Caviezel deserved better than his simple character; he tries hard but can't really be the presence he needs to be.A solid enough thriller then, but just one that is hard to get into and stay with consistently mainly because it fails to deliver its concept in a convincing and engaging way. It has its moments but as a total film it isn't up to much.",Null,1,3,12 July 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A wonderful family movie
","When Elliot hears strange noises from his garden shed he finds an alien there - left behind when it's craft had to leave early.  He brings `ET' into the house and shows his siblings, who help ET feel at home and settled. However ET begins to plan a way to signal back home to get picked up, meanwhile Elliot and ET start to have their feelings join up.Be honest - there must be very few people do at very least don't have a lump in there throats at some point during this film.  The plot is a simple tale of an alien who befriends a young boy however it is told with such pathos and wit that it is very hard not to love it.  Here is an example that shows that Spielberg can actually make a sweet film without totally killing it with syrupy sentiment - although that's not to say that he doesn't cut it very fine at times here.  ET is an ugly little beast but he easily wins over an audience.  His link to Elliot is never totally explained but it is well used, whether it's in the classroom scene or the touching scene near the end.The film has a real wit to it that is never hilarious but sits very well with the gentle emotion of the film.  Most of the reason lies with the cast. This is seen in the fact that in the 20th anniversary version of the film, several scenes were added with a cgi ET - they mostly added humour but didn't totally work because it is the very talented child cast that makes it work.Thomas' Elliot is cute but not to the sickly point, he is sassy and smart (but again not to the point of being annoying).  Barrymore does all the stuff she does now - little smirk and smart mouth!  But she is really good and I wish more child actors could be as fun and natural as she was here. Ironically it is the eldest of the three children that is the weakest - he is a teenager and falls to the surely side, he is quite wooden for too much of the film.  However it is ET who is the star of the film and, watching it as an adult now, it is amazing how expressive he is for a puppet - he may not look like much when viewed alongside modern cgi characters (ie Gollum) but he is very expressive and very much a character rather than an effect; Barrymore was not the only one to be taken in by him as a real character! In fact the cgi ET looks weaker if anything because he does look like an effect first and a character second; it's hard to describe but the puppet works better because he is in the scenes whereas the effect has clearly been added later.Overall though this is a wonderful film that I saw as a child in a bingo hall cinema and loved and watch as an adult now and love.  There is really very little that is wrong with it and Spielberg holds back the syrup for only a few scenes that are emotional enough to justify it.  The cast of children show, where later Spielberg films don't, that child actors don't need to be horribly cutest kids that bare no resemblance to real life, and they create a real sense of audience involvement and identification as well as emotion and wit.",Null,4,8,11 January 2004
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Great fun film for both adults and older kids
","Down on his luck Eddie Valiant is hired by cartoon studio producer RK Maroon to help get his main star, Roger Rabbit, to focus on the job rather than his wife.  To do this Valiant is told to get photographs of Jessica Rabbit with another man.  He does this but it only serves to send Roger into a rage and he storms off the lot.  When the man that was photographed with Jessica turns up dead the next day, Roger is wanted by the police and the toon hating Judge Doom.  Roger goes to Valiant to help him, but is there more to the story than meets the eye?I saw this film years ago in the cinema as a child and loved it then just as much as I do now.  The plot is a classic bit of noir - complete with drunken, bitter private dick, a beautiful but untrustworthy femme fatale, plot twists and a patsy.  The twist here is that this is a kids film (more or less) and that it features cartoon characters!  This works well - making it accessible for kids but still clever enough for adults.That's not to say that the adults won't like the cartoons too.  With so many famous characters making cameos there is plenty of cartoons for adults to enjoy.  The humour of the film is quite violent and may not be appropriate for younger children - especially the steamroller scene near the end which I found a little upsetting when I saw this as a preteen.  Regardless of that the film is still pretty funny and can be enjoyed by most, even if kids won't get the plot or references to other movies.Hoskins is good - he fits the rundown noir mould well but can also clown when he has to.  Lloyd is a great bad guy - scary enough to bother kids but not comic to the point that he is a clown character to adults.  Jessica Rabbit sticks in the mind, likely one of the best femme fatales if she were real, she is voiced really well by Turner and the animation fits her voice well.  Fleischer's Roger is good for a cartoon character but it is often the other cartoon characters that are more enjoyable; not only the various cameos but also the weasels and the taxicab.Overall this is a good movie but maybe not for young kids due to the dark edge and some scary scenes.  However for older children and adults this is real good fun - a good plot, a noir atmosphere and a clever twist on the creation of cartoons in the real world.",Null,3,3,28 December 2003
Minority Report," Dark, complex and interesting
","In the year 2054 the murder rate in Washington is zero because of the Pre-Crime division.  Pre-Crime uses three pre-cognitives to see the near future and direct officers to arrest the murderers before they can commit the act.  However during a visit by an assessing authority the pre-cognitives see chief officer John Anderton kill a man.  John runs, escaping the pre-crime police and trying to find out how and why he was seen killing a man.This contains many levels of seeing, maybe linking up with how Speilberg sees his films  at first the visions are easily controlled but then they are fallible and more complex.  Anderton even changes his eyes at one point to show how his vision is changed.  Aside from these metaphors the film itself is a lot more complex than Speilberg would have done several years ago.  The film deals with a complex future where we are pre-judged by a big brother style police and the film does have an element of the moral questioning that this throws up.  However for the majority it is a complex mystery film and this carries it no problem right up till the end.The end (I'm not spoiling it) is where it trips up a little  the conclusion is a little too easy and the ends are too tidily tied up, showing that Speilberg perhaps isn't yet the mature director he almost is.  His vision however is very good, yes, we have all the CGI we need and only occasionally does it not look good.  However more than all the CGI, Speilberg mixes the present with his futuristic vision rather than having us all living in pods!Cruise has become more mature as well.  His Anderton starts out as an Ethan Hawk character  full of confidence, but later he is able to add more layers and more doubt.  He is also able to act well beside some other strong performances from good actors like Max Von Sydow and a strong Colin Farrell. The rest of the cast has some famous faces like Ayre Gross, Sam Morton, Tim Blake Nelson, Stormare etc but outside of them really it's Cruise all the way.Overall it may disappoint the Jurassic Park/Matrix audience expecting a fast, action packed thriller  the marketing makes it look like the Matrix when really it's much more like the noir of Bladerunner.  The moral complexities run nicely alongside the action but eventually it falls into Speilberg sentiment mode with a disappointing end.  Overall though this is very good but not quite Bladerunner.",Null,12,18,7 July 2002
Finding Neverland," An enjoyable film, but its sense of wonder undermines its status as a real and emotionally involving story
","With yet another disappointing play under his belt, JM Barrie is understandably down, and a cold and distant relationship with his wife doesn't help simulate his creative juices. Writing in the local park as he does, Barrie meets widow Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies and her four sons. Enjoying his day with the children, Barrie gets to know Sylvia and become her friend; however the social circle that Barrie moves in looks down on such relationships and the whole thing further damages his marriage. However it is in his friendship and imaginative playing that Barrie finds his inspiration and begins writing what will turn out to be his most successful and memorable play.On the basis of a five star review from Empire Magazine and the presence of the ever worth a risk Johnny Depp, I came to this film without a great love of Peter Pan or Barrie and it was more the appeal of the actor that drew me more than it was the man Barrie. Maybe it is for this reason that I enjoyed the film but was not totally won over by it in the same way as many other viewers seem to have been; maybe it is because I didn't approach the film filled with the sense of wonder that the film drops on us and, although I recognise how important it was to the film, I couldn't help feeling that it also took away from the reality of the story at the same time. The plot was interesting but I was more interested in the real side of the story that I was in the flights of imaginative fancy that it regularly heads off on. I enjoyed these scenes as well but they only had value beyond adding a sense of wonder to the film and to the story whereas I felt the film gave short change to the actual reality of the story  especially the scandal around Barrie and Sylvia's friendship and the decay of Barrie's marriage.In a way is that the film wanted to be too full of wonder and shy away from the darker stuff that made it lose some of its impact and appeal to me. It seemed that either issues were simplified or they were simply resolved (or lessened) by Barrie's insistence that things could be solved by just going into your imagination and so on. However this does the alleged darker side of the story a disservice because, although we hear of the chatter of paedophilia (a claim the boys have always totally denied) the story tends to make things like Barrie's marriage break-up and so on easier to swallow by encouraging us to see his marriage as already at an end (and we are encourage to blame his wife) and also to look more to the wonder he brought that the harm that we know he was actually causing to the Llewelyn-Davies family. Of course to bring these out would have damaged the sense of wonder the rest of the film encourages us to buy into and would have made this a different and less sweet affair, but would have been more interesting to me.If anything it wants to be too 'nice' and full of wonder  and real life is rarely that way or that morally simple.Of course many people will not have come to this film for Barrie but for Depp and they will not be disappointed because, moral simplicity aside, Depp gives an assured performance the likes of which we have come to expect from him over the course of his career. The Scottish accent is pretty good although quite soft and therefore kept accessible to the American market. He does well with both the imagined stuff but also with the difficult emotional stuff  Depp managing to put in the complexity that really the script should have helped him with more. Winslet is OK but rather simplistic and too easily sweet and played in contrast with her mother and Barrie's wife. She is a good actress here but didn't have much to really work with. Therefore Christie and Mitchell are not as good as they should have been  certainly Mitchell was done a great disservice as the film simply had no time for her pain or longing to have been involved in her husband's world in the same way as Davies was. Highmore was impressive and he is the main person to keep the film in reality with his outburst of pain; he too falls in with the wonder by the end but at times his pain and confusion is very engaging and refreshingly convincing and real. Hoffman was a strange find but he is a welcome addition  his distinctive presence complimented by a handful of amusing lines that more than cover for the fact that he does seem a little out of place in turn of the century England! People like Ian Hart and Paul Whitehouse barely make an impression but it is nice to see them anyway.Overall this is a good film but in a way the sense of wonder that many people have praised was also one of its weaknesses. Instead of being a real story that showed the complex emotions of the situation (even the simplified situation seen here) the film tends to err on the side of wonder and shirks away from the difficult issues that would have left the audience unsure whether to really root for Barrie or not and instead enjoys itself on its flights of fancy. It still have enough emotion and wonder to make it an enjoyable film that is worth seeing but I couldn't help feeling that it really was going for easy targets and avoiding things that would make things more difficult for both it and its audience.",Null,16,34,9 November 2004
G.I. Jane," Unspectacular 'against the odds' affair high on gloss but weak on dialogue, performances and character
","A senior female Senator pushes the issue of the role of women in the military and finds herself with an ultimatum  put some test cases through the Navy SEAL training programme and, if they make it, then the possibility of equality is on the table. The applicants are varied but Senator DeHaven settles on Lt Jordan O'Neil, an intel officer who has the smarts and the drive to potentially make it but also the looks to help by being quite 'media-friendly'.I might be wrong but I do recall GI Jane being one of the films that saw Moore's career start/continue its slide from box office success to box office risk. It is also one that mostly attracts fairly poor reviews from most audiences. Watching it recently I must admit that I can see both sides of the argument  which is why the rating for this film is almost squarely on 5 out of 10 as well I suppose! At its heart the film is a solid tale about overcoming obstacles in the pursuit of equality. It is not a theme that we haven't seen before and it is one that I thought might be interesting. To an extent it is and it does push just enough dramatic buttons to do the job  even an all-action conclusion. The problem is though the film is not really intelligent enough to rise above these basics.So what we do get is a rather noisy affair where guts and violence are exposed in all the characters and probably too many shots of O'Neil in tiny shorts and vest doing push-ups with lots of sweaty flesh exposed; I got the point it was making but it did feel a bit gratuitous. Likewise the narrative did emphasis the degree to which O'Neil proved herself equal in terms of violence and aggression, although I was glad that the overall thrust was that she was an equal member of the team, with her intel skills being what earned her her place rather than the ability to kick people.Moore is a good presence in the lead role but she never really has a character that goes deeper than one that can be described in simple words like 'determined' or 'gutsy'. Nor can she make at times terrible dialogue work ('suck my d**k' etc) but then I cannot imagine who could. Mortensen hangs round moodily in tiny shorts doing a weak version of the movie cliché  at times he comes off more like a wife-beater than a motivator and trainer. Bancroft is hammy to the point of being a bit silly in her early scenes; she pulls it back a bit at the end but not too much. The support cast all feature typical performances from Chestnut, von Bargen, Caviezel, Kestner and others.Overall then a so-so film. It does the basic well enough within the gloss of a typically Hollywood film. However with some terrible dialogue, two dimensional characters and a predictable narrative arch, it is likely to disappoint in as many ways as it engages.",Null,3,8,26 July 2007
Training Day," A pretty standard cop thriller is livened up by a good (if not Oscar-worthy) performance from Washington
","After making his application to join a special unit within the LAPD, Officer Jake Hoyt is assigned to his new boss, Alonzo Harris for a training day on the job. Harris immediately shows Hoyt a way of work that is foreign to him  making him smoke drugs and drink at the very start of his shift. From this point onwards, Hoyt is taken on an eye opening training day that forces him to depart from his professional ethics and try to understand how things are done on the street. But is Harris really working for justice his own way or is he working for himself  and how far will Hoyt sink before he cannot justify it anymore?When this film came out I wanted to see it as a thriller; after the Oscar for Washington I wanted to see it for another reason and eventually got round to seeing it on video. The plot starts on familiar territory and pretty much continues along the same road for the whole film  it is never really more than an average cop thriller but it still manages to be quite enjoyable. The film sticks to the 'ends justify the means' plot device for the first half but then pull back to reveal a wider plot that is more of a standard thriller. In the first half this is all stuff we have seen before and it sort of works but not as well as things like The Shield etc  Alonzo is too out there to manage to make me be for him and against him; unlike the Shield where you are constantly being challenged by Mackey. The second half is more dramatic and, although a bit forced, is necessary to bring the film round to a dramatic conclusion.The Oscar for Denzel was not deserved in my opinion. Having now seen his performance I will acknowledge that he is a big part of this film working but he is not Oscar worthy here. Actually his performance is just par for the course for this type of film  yes he is a bit of a powerhouse and his tough delivery really makes the film move but it is hardly worthy of being called the best performance of the year even if it is really effective within the context of the film. Hawke is pretty good but obviously plays second fiddle to Washington's scene stealing performance; he is wide eyed as required and he serves well as our entry into Alonzo's world. The support cast features quite a few well known faces but mostly they are underused and play slightly worn ethnic clichés full of tattoos and 'mo-fo' dialogue  Macy Gray, Dre and Snoop represent the rap community while Mendes shows ass and Glenn, Yulin, Barry and Greene add recognisable faces if nothing else.Overall this is an enjoyable but standard cop thriller that has gotten better reviews than it perhaps deserves. Although he doesn't not deserve his Oscar for this, Washington's performance still drives the film and is fun nonetheless and certainly livens up what is, for all it's stars and it's publicity, is still a standard cop thriller with bells on.",Null,3,25,24 May 2004
In Bruges," Doesn't quite work but is still darkly comic and entertaining
","Hit men Ray and Ken have been sent to Bruges to lay low for a while and await a call from their criminal boss Harry. They are meant to stay near the phone in the evening and are free to sightsee during the day but Ray is less than impressed with his surroundings even in Ken is soaking it all in. While they await further instructions, the two talk over things, travel round the city, get involved with some of the cast and crew making a film and generally fail to stay out of trouble or maintain a low profile.In Bruges was sold as a hilarious comedy and this in combination with the names involved made me want to check it out. It was mis-sold but this is not to say that the film still wasn't pretty good. It is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny but it is only occasionally and mostly the tone is very black, with humour coming laced with violence. On the flip of this approach though the film does still have a plot where the characters are in danger and it does still expect to pack a narrative and emotional punch. Both sides are OK but they do not work as well together as I would have liked. When it is funny the film is brilliant, with great lines juxtapositioning with the often violent situations they are in and this darkly comic stuff really appealed to me but the downside is that it does make it harder to suddenly launch into a more dramatic film where we really need to feel the danger. This is difficult given we have just watched danger being dealt with in a comic and offhand way, so my heart was not really in it in the later stages of the film.When the violence is handled with humour, it doesn't bother me much but the gore and the impact of the violence is pretty harshly depicted, which again makes the film a little hard to 'enjoy' in the way I was in the first half of the movie. Really it needed to go one way or the other for definite so that there was an overall direction for the film because, as it is, it does feel like two different approaches with a reasonable blend in the middle. The cast make it work though and you can see from their performances that they know they are the whole show here. Farrell impressed me with his comedy abilities and although he did remind me of Father Dougal at times, he is really good here, getting laughs and being able to deliver sudden brutality. Gleeson is equally good and the film is great when the two of them are allowed to play off one another. Fiennes helps the latter stages of the film work because his performance is strong  injecting dark energy into the film just when it needed something to carry it across the end. Reuten and Prentice are OK but are very much secondary to the main three.Overall In Bruges is not a brilliant or hilarious film but it does more or less work and entertain throughout. The darker it gets the less it works and the ending is not as strong as the first half of the film but mostly the darkly comic and brutal material does work thanks to the really good playing from the three main actors, while Bruges itself provides a picturesque background. Come to it with low expectations and it will probably charm and engage you but it is not quite as good as some would have you believe.",Null,8,14,4 January 2009
John Wick," Viscerally enjoyable tosh
","When disease takes the wife of former contract killer John Wick, he can find no respite apart from a dog, gifted to him by his wife so that he will have something to focus his love on, to prevent him from slipping back into his former dark ways. A chance encounter with a Russian thug sees Wick's connection to this life severed, and he sets out for vengeance – a path that will take him up against the most powerful criminal gang in the city.Although it does start with a satisfyingly meaty emotional base, this film is one long action sequence of impossible acts and violence (with Wick seemingly looking to get extra XP from headshots). There is of course a limit to the appeal of this, but it is hard not to enjoy the mindless dark heart of this whole film, as it relentlessly drives forward with little thought of external logic, instead selling itself hard and fast throughout. Mostly this approach works; with minimal set-up it is not long before the violence begins in earnest, and it is solidly and stylishly done throughout, with slick design and satisfying set-pieces. The style does help because, with Wick being pretty much the Terminator, it is not always easy to feel any tension from peril, so instead we get the tension from the relentlessness and the speed of movement.Reeves is a good lead for this, since it does essentially require him to be emotionless and enigmatic – both of which he can pull off. He is surrounded by familiar faces, all of whom feel like maybe they were wasted by being in the film for only short times each, but all of which give the film a sense of quality – and everyone does produce something even if they only have one or two scenes (also fun for fans of The Wire to see the couple of faces showing up). All told, this is not the reinvention of action movies (as some have said) but it just a reminder of how they should be done well – enough emotional grit for us to care, and then good solid relentless action the rest of the way. It is nonsense, as so much of this genre is, but it is visceral, tough, dark, and really quite fun.",Null,6,12,19 July 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Well crafted and fun film with strong story and characters driving the humour
","Po may well dream of kung fu glory but the reality is that he is heavy, lazy, food-focused and likely to spend his life in the noodle business like his father. When the test for the Dragon Warrior is announced, Po hopes at very least to be an observer of the contest. So imagine his surprise when he finds himself to be the one chosen. Trainer Shifu and his students are sceptical at least and furious at worst, but are confident that Po will soon quit, but they do not count on the sheer, good natured pleasure that Po takes from just being involved. Thing is, what Po doesn't know is that the Dragon Warrior is prophesied as the only one who can stop the powerful and evil Tai Lung, who has just broken free of a prison of one prisoner and a thousand guards.I wasn't totally sold on going to see this film but it got the group vote so away I went. It wasn't that any one thing put me off it, it was just that the bar has been set high for this sort of thing by Pixar etc and I have been disappointed by some films that were 'only' OK. Kung Fu Panda opens with a really cool sequence that suits the genre of animated martial arts films and then quickly moves into reality and the seemingly straightforward tale of an individual who aspires to more than his appearance would suggest him capable of. It sounds generic and indeed I suppose that, in its basest form, it is but it is the delivery that sees it be much more than just this.It worried me at first that the film was not loaded with pop culture references and 'for the adults only' one-liners that Shrek etc often are but I quickly got over this. Instead of lots of quick fire humour, Kung Fu Panda actually focuses on the characters and the story and builds the humour onto that rather than the two just happening to be alongside one another. As The Times noted, the film is also free of lavatorial humour which is not only a pleasing omission but one that must have been deliberate given how easy it would have been to draw f*rt gags from the main character of Po! But instead it is a smarter type of humour, with the only downside being that younger children might be a bit restless at the infrequency of really obvious comedy. I didn't roll with laughter that much either but for me it was more rewarding as a film rather than an animated series of references and sly gags.The focus on character does help because I was drawn into the story quick effectively to the point where I wasn't bored if I didn't have a laugh for five minutes. Those that set up the quick-fire stuff as the agenda risk this feeling but the story was my interest here. It also helps the voice actors to be more than just voices. Black and Hoffman both benefit greatly from this and the expressions of their animated characters. McShane has a simpler character but his voice really suits Tai Lung. The supporting cast looks great on paper with Jolie, Cross, Rogen, Liu and Chan but sadly they are not that well used and have too few lines considering. One star with no dialogue is the animation itself. It is amazingly detailed and stunning and yet another example of how the technology seems to be constantly moving in leaps and bounds.Kung Fu Panda is not the funniest animated film you will see and it doesn't really deliver the rapid laughs of Shrek (for example). This comes with the approach though because the film doesn't load itself with pop culture references and lots of gags for kids while slipping adult humour into the one-liners, instead it is much more satisfying in its construction and deliver. The clichéd framework of the plot is fleshed out really well and ultimately I really enjoyed it for this. Well worth seeing for what it is and how unpretentious it all is.",Null,1,2,13 July 2008
Chinatown," A very classy, consistently engaging and dark detective story
","Jake Gittes is a former cop turned private detective. When he is contracted by a Mrs Mulwray to find out if her husband is having an affair, he takes to trailing Water Company Executive Hollis Mulwray. Mulwray appears to only have water and a dry riverbed on his mind but eventually they catch him with a young woman, although almost immediately the news gets leaked to the papers and Mulwray goes missing, only to turn up dead. At this point the real Mrs Mulwray comes to Gittes threatening to sue him for his involvement and Jake realises that he had been set up to set up the Mulwrays. He continues his investigation into the murder only to find a conspiracy involving thousands of gallons of water being wasted during a drought and the mysterious presence of Mrs Mulwray's father, Noah Cross.As a fan of film noir and tough detective movies, I am too often put off by modern entries into the genre that try to replace atmosphere and intelligence by just having nudity and swearing; the genre managed atmosphere without these in the forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to rely on them. With Chinatown however, everything works well as a homage to the best years of the genre and, as such, is very well set in the period and is of suitable presentation even if the material and tone is darker and harder than would have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it is just a copy and paste from better films because it isn't and indeed stands out as one of the best detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is always going to be the most important thing and it gets it spot on throughout, doing the proper thing of starting with a simple story and continually building it more and more complex as it goes. Unlike some other 'classics' of the genre, Chinatown manages to do this without ever losing the audience and I found the plot to be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy to follow.Needless to say, things are very dark and the script is convincingly dark and miserable, leading to an ending that is as depressing as I've seen  not so much in what actually happens but also in the wider implications for the characters that the credits prevent us from seeing. Director Polanski does a great job of putting this story in a lush setting that produces a real strong sense of period but also manages to always be showing us the darkness coming through subtly throughout the movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this role and, if I had to pick one film to act as an introduction to Nicholson then it would be this one. He is tough yet damaged, upright but seedy and he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and manages to ooze menace while also coming across as a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine but really the film belongs to these three, with Nicholson being the stand out role.Overall this is a very classy film that has stood up very well to become a well-deserved classic. The story is complex, mysterious yet simple to follow; it is dark and seedy without relying on swearing or nudity to set the atmosphere. The direction is great, with a real atmosphere and sense of time and place that is matched by a great collection of performances delivering a great script.",Null,215,287,3 January 2005
Gravity," The intensity of the experience covers up for the weaknesses in the events and writing
","I am really not a fan of 3D; I dislike that everything seems darker and a little bit harder to see and even for the big banner 3D movie (Avatar) it seemed like an unnecessary gimmick that didn't do enough to cover up a not particularly good film. Add to this the number of films that are cheaply retrofitted with 3D for the sake of money and I really have no interest in seeing anything in 3D if I have a normal option. Gravity was the exception since from what I heard it was probably worth seeing in 3D and from seeing it I can agree with this.As a piece of technology, Gravity is really impressive. I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don't stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct. That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn't made a fuss of and doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film. Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride. Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn't stop until the end. Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision, but in this case the feeling of being 'in' the film really work and aside from one or two 'thing coming at you' moments, it really worked. For me equally impressive was the sound engineering; most sound effects are given a really satisfying 'via contact' sound – the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air. This was done so very well and helped me get into it as much as the visuals and effects.The one thing to say though is that all of this probably only applies if you see it in the cinema and with the full experience because this is what it is about – and it would be wrong to get sucked up in the experience and not see the weaknesses within this film. Specifically these are in the content and they will be more apparent on a smaller screen. The events within the film are so unlikely that without these strong aspects drawing you in, they will probably be more likely to push you out of the experience to question what you are watching. Attempts to add character and back story are OK but only as part of an already engaging experience – mostly they are only so-so and one or two rather clunky bits of symbolism really don't work. That said it is not down to the cast. Clooney may be very much about his calmness under pressure and his great presence but Bullock does a very good job to be vulnerable and fighting to survive and just like the effects do, her performance draws you in even if the material she sometimes has to deliver has the potential to do the opposite.Gravity is only 90 minutes and it moves with intensity and urgency that is effective and greatly helped by how great it is as an experience. As such it will work best by far with a large screen and those silly overpriced glasses on because it is all about this and in this context the weaknesses are less impacting – but there are weaknesses and they do have an impact and I suspect that as the film moves onto smaller screens, these will be more apparent.",Null,16,31,20 November 2013
Lone Survivor," Effective but sits awkwardly in the middle of impacting horror and flag-waving heroism (SPOILERS – although the title did it already)
","To get it out of the way – what a terrible title for the film. I am sure that many will know this story but I am equally sure that many more will not, myself included; so to essentially suggest from the moment we buy a ticket that there is a lone survivor is a very strange choice for a title. I am used to trailers giving the ending away, but I can't think of many other titles that do it like this. Anyway, that out of the way not, this film is a dramatization of the failed Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan where four Navy Seals are hunted by a small army as they try to escape – and just in case you don't know the true story, and don't know the title of the film, let me just say that it does not go well.Assuming that we know how this will go, the film is still pretty effective in what it does and I do think that Berg has done an overall good job of directing but at the same time I get the feeling that he wants to do too many things that don't all sit well together. How you take this film will depend on you and there are really several ways to come at it. On one hand this is a terrible waste of life across the board and it is a story of human suffering and death in a war that is full of it. However on the flipside of that, to think this way is to not 'support the troops' and the other way to watch it is to cheer when the Seals valiantly try to hold their position, and remove your cap and let a single tear fall when one of them fails to make it. It is difficult to do both but this is what the film tries to do because we have a sense of flag-waving pride while also the real horror and impact of what we are watching. Which side of the film you feel is the 'right' direction is up to you, but for sure having both makes for an awkward pairing.For me I think the film worked best when it was horrific, when fear and pain was being shared with the viewer and the hopelessness of the reality is allowed to set in. I would have liked to have known the men a bit better to have had more of an emotional connection but for what it was I felt moved and impacted by the action – not excited. At times the action sequences seem to back this up and they are not so much exciting as horrific – I doubt few people would be thrilled by the waste of life as a rescue helicopter loaded with men is downed. However at times the action is quite thrilling and it does seem to be trying to get the home fans on their feet almost. Such moments are capped by the heroic and manly deaths that are often delivered in stylish and respectful ways albeit with the problem that you do feel they should have a superimposed American flag fade into the background of the shot at the same time. This mix of aims never settles down and while it is all still effective as a story, I often felt like I did often wish that Berg would get off the fence and do something a bit more and other things a bit less.The cast are good and they do what is required of them, albeit this changes. The use of familiar faces helps overcome some of the lack of characterization, because in a way we 'know' the men, albeit as faces not people. Wahlberg is an obvious bit of casting and I don't know if he was the best for the job albeit he is a big name and gets it done. Kitsch, Bana, Foster and others are all as good as him and I did appreciate the respect they showed the character but yet their performances didn't hide the fear, the desperation and the ultimate tragedy of what happened. Lone Survivor is an effective film which tells a tragic story in an engaging way. It is a shame that it flips around from 'brutal horror' to 'posed heroic death' mode because the two approaches undermine one another whereas to make one the goal would have made a more consistent film (and which is 'right' is really down to the individual in this case). Worth seeing for the story and what it does well, but I would have liked it to hit me much harder than it did by simply taking the parts that it did really well and focusing on doing them more often.",Null,5,9,8 February 2014
To Be or Not to Be," Witty and mocking
","Joseph Tura and his wife are part of an actors troop in pre-WW2 Poland. When a handsome young pilot is forced to break off his affair with Mrs Tura to go to England and join the RAF, he sends a message through an English agent who offers to take messages to families of all the pilots when he goes to Poland.  Realising too late that Professor Siletsky is a double agent taking addresses to the Nazi's, Lt Sobinski alerts Tura who is forced to play several roles to try and outwit the Nazi's and protect the underground resistance.Despite having heard it mentioned (and avoided the remake) I had still never seen this film until earlier today.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I knew that it had been made during the war and that it's humour might not seem as mocking or sharp today.  However I was surprised how funny it actually was while it also dealt with the Nazi issue at the same time.  The mocking tone of the film is balanced nicely by a real vein of wit with sharp word play all around.  The plot is kept ticking over by this humour until Tura is able to drive the film by his many performances!The Nazi's are mocked without taking away from the horrors of what they were.  The cast are what really makes the film work for me though.  Although he takes second billing, I can't help but feel that Benny is the star of the film as he has all the best characters and the lion's share of the lines. Lombard does very well indeed and shows a real ability for quick witty lines  the fact that she died in a plane crash leaving this her last movie should be considered a great loss.  The whole support cast, whether Polish actor or German commander, all play very well managing to bring both wit and pathos to the film.Overall a film that is not as uncomfortable to watch as I suspected it might have been, in fact one that is downright hilarious at times and has all the sharpness and wit that I want in a comedy.  When Jack Benny says `so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt' for the 5th time, I defy you not to be rolling!",Null,31,64,20 September 2003
Monty Python's Life of Brian," A classic comedy that is rightly held up as the best of the Python films
","Born in a stable, the infant Brian is mistaken for someone else until the wise men twig that they are in the wrong stable. Brian's life continues to be unremarkable until he is about 30 when he gets mixed up with the People's Front of Judea in their fight against the Romans (although he is only there to try and get in Judith). Unsurprisingly the actions of the PFJ don't exactly particularly succeed and Brian finds himself on the run from the Romans as a result. However while hiding out in speakers' corner he is first taken for a wise teacher but then for some sort of messiah  a mistaken identity that escalates out of control very quickly.Watching the film now it is not really worth discussing whether this is mocking Jesus or not because the accepted wisdom is now that it is not an attack on Jesus but rather a lampoon on religion itself (although their original idea was to make 'Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory'). However if it doesn't seem so controversial nowadays just imagine an Islamic remake and how that would be received. Anyway back to the film in hand rather than the reaction of people who have not seen it complaining about their perception of it. At its heart this is a Monty Python film and the sense of humour is very British and very much them. I say this rather obvious statement because despite the fuss the most memorable thing about the film is how funny it is. It will always be remembered for the controversy but when you watch it it is basically a collection of sketches and comedy characters rolling one after the other with many of them well-known and full of memorable and funny dialogue.That it isn't just a collection of sketches held together (like some of their other films) is down to how good the story is. Of course they did have a bit of help with this in regards material to adapt but still it does feel much more satisfying to have this solid narrative underneath all the madness. Over time some people have come to seen this film as an entire attack on religion but it isn't because the laughs were the focus. However scattered across the whole film are scenes that do effectively lampoon the concept of religious beliefs and religious establishments. Most of these are very clever and, in particular, one scene sums up the history of religious splits and factions (the shoe and the gourd) and is impressive in its superficial simplicity.It goes without saying that the cast are all on fine form. Although he wanted to play Brian, Cleese is much, much more effective in the many small roles he has and is best when he has petty authority figures to deliver. Of course similar things could said of all of the cast as Idle, Jones, Palin and Gilliam are all very good in their characters and are mostly all playing to their strengths. In the 'title' role Chapman actually has the least rewarding role as he has to play it (comparatively) straight in order to keep the narrative together. He does it very well but the rest of the Pythons are much better simply because they have sketches to delivery rather than a narrative to drive.Overall then this is a classic comedy that is rightly held up as the best of the Python films. Scene by scene it is a great collection of absurd sketches but the narrative is pretty much strong enough to prevent it just being this. Although the laughs are the all, the film has plenty of clever lampoons on the development of religions and religious organisations. It is a shame that it is so well known for the controversy because this has so much more that makes it memorable.",Null,4,10,24 January 2007
Erin Brockovich," Enjoyable
","Out of work, out of hope, trashy, twice divorced single mother Erin fails to get another job due to her lack of experience. On her way home she is hit by another car. She goes to lawyer Ed Masry who spectacularly fails to win her any damages. Erin demands he gives her a job and he begrudgingly does. Doing some of his pro-bono work, Erin uncovers evidence that suggests that manufacturing firm PG&E had poisoned the local water supply and lie to residents about the content. As she looks deeper she finds a legacy of illness and a small bit of research turns into a mammoth case.I don't know how much of this drama is factual and how much of it is changed to add to dramatic effect but regardless the story is involving, funny and moving. At the time there was a rash of 'environmental damage' legal films of which this is one of the more polished and classy. The film focuses as much on Erin as it does on the case and at times it risked failing as a legal drama/thriller. However it still grips as the facts pretty much speak for themselves  the film adds to this by creating a real sense of PG&E as a monster without scruples or concern for the residents. As a result the events feel more powerful and involving. It feels slow at times, but if you're into it then it feels patient rather than slow and deliberate rather than laboured.The biggest reason that the focus on Erin works is because Roberts really does very well giving her Erin a down to earth, trashy feel that could have been hammy or unbelievable (she is a multimillion pound actress after all), but it wasn't. Instead it was realistic and quite warm  where she could have been annoying. The grumpy Finney is also good value and seems natural in the role. Eckhart is almost too good to be true but gives a likable performance and is a winning non-distraction.The film benefits from the style that Soderbergh brings to it. It glides with the grace that he brought to Ocean's 11 and has the rich colouring that parts of Traffic had. His direction really adds to the film and makes the sum feel a little greater that the parts put together.Overall this may not be the legal thriller that you hoped for and it may move a great deal slower that I thought a Hollywood film would, but it is worth it. The film is patient and worth baring with and Roberts is actually pretty good in the lead! Enjoyable.",Null,33,48,21 February 2003
The Death of Stalin," Cruel, chilling, absurd, and funny
","Taking his lead from the farcical absurdity which he has always done so well, director Iannucci turns to Soviet politics and the days after the death of Stalin. In doing so he produces a film that seems like a bit of a hard sell; truth be told it took me a minute to be motivated to watch it on the basis that it didn't 'sound' good. From the opening scenes though, the tone is clear and strong. The uneasy actions of the inner circle are played out in a 'relaxed' meal, while at the same time an entire orchestra frantically try to save their own lives by simply complying with a request from Stalin. These opening scenes are funny and absurd but yet they have a genuine menace and fear to them.It is hard to describe but neither of these aspects undercut the other. The film manages to work as it plays out a massacre but yet has wonderfully funny dialogue and performances. This combination is deftly balanced and I wish I even had the skill to explain it, far less do it. The cruelty of the clamber for power, and the ruthless callousness of those who have it is chilling even as you laugh, but it is the laughter that is more impressive. The absurd but witty dialogue, combined with plenty of genuinely funny comedic touches in the small details (the accents, the pyjamas, the phrasing), all make the film very funny and had laughs where I least expected it at times. The cast are well served with the material, and are very good at making the most of it. Buscemi, Tambor, Beale, McLoughlin, Palin, Whitehouse, Friend, Isaacs, and really all the cast get the tone of the film just right. The comedic timing is spot on for all, but so too are the performances of men scheming and manipulating all the time while knowing the firing squad may be just around the corner.Well worth watching. It has moments as funny as Thick of It etc, but yet has a darkness that makes it much more satisfying and engaging to watch.",Null,3,5,24 March 2018
Meet the Parents," Funny  but it gets difficult to laugh at Greg's misfortune
","Greg Focker is ready to propose to his girlfriend Pam but before he does he finds out that she would expect him to ask her father first.  On the visit to meet her parents however nothing goes to plan and Pam's father Jack dislikes Greg immediately.  Matters are only made worse when Greg begins to realise what Jack used to do for a living.I first saw this in a cinema and recently watched it again on video.  In the cinema I roared and on video I laughed but not as much  the crowd helped the first time.  However it is still very funny  Focker is the most put-upon man I've ever seen!  However with this comes the main problem  I almost felt too sorry for him to be able to laugh at his misfortunes.  This isn't help by the fact that most of Jack's doctor friends are really unpleasant obnoxious people who I wanted to slap.  However much of it is still funny but the final act is difficult because he is so downcast you can't help but feel sympathetic rather than amused.Stiller does a good character but really is almost too realistic  like I said, I felt a bit guilty laughing.  De Niro and comedy are not always best friends (he has some good ones and some real bad ones), happily here he is really good sending up his tough guy image spot on.  Of the rest of the cast I have nothing to say, except that Owen Wilson has a great cameo playing up his laid back character really well.Overall this is really funny even if it lacks subtlety.  However it is really a bad point that, once the misfortunes begin getting worse and more severe we do begin to feel for Greg and dislike those who mock him.  However when we laugh we also mock him and therefore I found the second half a little harder to laugh at  mind you it was still funny for the majority.",Null,2,4,7 July 2002
Mulan," Despite a few weak songs this is a great cartoon
","Mulan is a tomboy of sorts - not something that is looked for in a Chinese wife, and she causes constant worry and dishonour to her family.  When the Huns attack China, the Emperor commands each family to put one man forward to fight.  With Mulan's aged father the only man of the family it looks like he must fight, but Mulan dresses as a man and takes his place.  With the help of dragon Mushu, Mulan overcomes her status as a woman to help take on the Hun.I wasn't sure I would like this film as I have grown a little tired of the Disney formula of `songs, romance and smartassed comedy sidekicks', which Mulan sticks to pretty well, however I did really enjoy this film.  I think it was mainly because of the sweep of the story, the big battles and the majestic feel to the movie.  The plot moves swiftly and felt like it was all over too quickly.  It has the usual mix of laughs for parents and kids as well as having quite a good story behind it all.The only major weakness is the songs.  I didn't exactly start tapping my feet at any of them and, while they are not bad per se, they aren't great and after a few lines I was wanting to skip past them (but couldn't - it was showing on TV).  Asides from these the film is funny and quite dramatic and is good fun to watch.  The cast are good.  Ming-Na is a good Mulan while Murphy rehearses for Shrek with his smart mouthed dragon that gets plenty of good laughs.  DB Wong is a good actor but has a `straight' role and doesn't distinguish himself.  I was worried at first by the presence of Harvey Fierstein, but he did good work and wasn't half as irritating as he usually is.With colourful animation that is good without being Pixar, this is a good cartoon that is fun, funny and, at times, dramatic.  I'm not a big fan of Disney over the last few years but I did really enjoy this film and would watch it again.",Null,49,70,26 December 2003
Se7en," Simply one of the darkest and best thrillers of the 1990's  but don't let anyone spoil it for you.....
","`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man.  With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him.  However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise.  Yes it wasn't a great film  but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created.  Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!Se7en was his major break through  where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold.  The story doesn't sound like much  mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless  the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller.  But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out.  From the start we are entombed in mood  the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc.  The we begin to find murders  but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest  Genius!What you don't see is more gory than what you do.  Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets betterright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen.  I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset  so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc.  But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer.  Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans  he spends a lot of it looking beaten up.  Paltrow is OK with what she has  but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles.  R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters.  He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly.  In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word.  However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller  but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's.",Null,26,37,29 March 2002
I'm Not There," The creative construct and delivery make it both flawed and fascinating but is still a great total film despite this
","A biopic of Bob Dylan seemed like it would be of interest because, as much as I did like No Direction Home, I did think it needed more meat on the bones for those not already informed. Long before I saw I'm Not There I knew it was not going to be played that way but the multiple actors and fact it was a Todd Haynes film made me curious to see how it would be done. Answering my own question by watching the film, I was pleased to find that it was done in a wonderfully creative and fascinating way that works so well as a creative project that it is hard to imagine how it could have been done any other way.Rather than make a straight biopic, Haynes and Moverman have taken events and themes from Dylan's life and created characters that echo this and delivered a patchwork of stories that play like different characters, the idea being that Dylan has had so many stages and faces in his life that this is the best way to do it. What this does is produce a film that is rich with creative ideas and is delivered by the same people who had them  hence feeding them on the screen and making it engaging. In the construct it is almost impossible to criticise because it is so clever and fascinating in its creativity. Likewise the delivery is great, with different styles employed across the threads all producing an experience that I found to be really effective.Sadly, as with most of my reviews, there is a 'but' on its way. As with Safe, the delivery from Haynes makes the film but it has a knock-on effect on the story being told. In this case the downside is in the actual biopic element of the film and I would suggest that the film will only work in this regard for those Dylan fans coming to it with knowledge of his life and career. For me I know the bigger picture sweep of his career and know many of the key moments but far from everything. As a result some of the threads were lost on me and some of them didn't work as well as others. A bit of a problem if you are looking for the film to engage in the content as well as be an experience  which, at over two hours, I was.As with the threads I didn't think all the actors did as well as each other. Blanchett does the best but in fairness is helped by having the most accessible thread for those coming to Dylan off the back of general popular culture. Her Dylan character is convincing and she plays it very well. Franklin was also engaging as his performance (acting and singing) was interesting. I though Ledger, Bale and Gere were not as good and I was a little disappointed considering how good at least two of these can be. In fairness though I was less engaged by their threads in the film and perhaps this reflected on their performance from my point of view.I'm Not There is a really great film though and it deserves to be seen for the reasons that it is great but you should not go into it unprepared for some aspects of it not being great. The concept, construct and delivery is fascinatingly creative but this approach affects the telling of the story and there are parts of the film that simply don't work and don't engage. However, if you come to it right, the film is more than good enough to cover for this seemingly important flaw and, as a creative project and experience, it is hard to fault and deserves to be seen.",Null,2,4,1 March 2009
The Big Lebowski," Not perfect but wonderfully imaginative and humorous
","When a case of mistaken identity results in a Chinese man urinating on the rung of Jeff `The Dude' Lebowski, the dude looks to his millionaire namesake to compensate him.  When the man's young wife is kidnapped, the dude is brought in to help drop off the money and get her back.  However when things go wrong he begins to see it is not as simple as he was led to believe.Although they can often be too clever for their own good (well, sometimes  not often) this is one of their cleverest and most imaginative out and out comedies.  The plot is unnecessarily complicated but only serves to give the film a larger than life feel as one unusual event follows another unlikely one!  While it all very much comes to naught, the delivery is the key.  In terms of laughs it is lighter than one might expect from a comedy in the imdb top 250, however it delivers a constant state of amusement as well as some laugh out loud moments  it's just not that type of humour is all.However the dialogue is very quotable and funnier the more you know it and understand the lines.  What makes it feel much more imaginative is the many inspired scenes that run through the film  mostly dream sequences set up as big musical numbers  but also the sheer weight of unusual characters who come to life so easily and are very funny to watch.  Part of this is with the cast of course and they all pretty much do a good job.  Bridges is simply made for this role and fills it so easily.  Goodman gives a great performance and steals many of his scenes while Buscemi does good work but in a much different role.  Character actors like Huddleston, Hoffman and Stormare all give good support while Turturro is incredibly memorable despite only having a few minutes of screen time.  I wasn't sure about Moore but she was OK and didn't slow things too much for me.Overall this is one of the Coen's most enjoyable comedies to date.  I know Intolerable Cruelty is out soon and I'll see what that's like, but so far this film just has so much creative energy and imagination that, although all a bit much and not a perfect film, it is very hard not to enjoy.",Null,7,15,19 October 2003
Unbreakable," Slow, thoughtful and clever -but the lack of traditional action or thrills may frustrate some
","A massive train crash outside Philadelphia kills 132 passengers and leaves only one survivor.  The survivor, security guard David Dunn walks away completely unhurt from the accident.  Some time later he is contacted by comic book collector Elijah Price who believes that comic books are merely exaggerated versions of truth and that some people are created weak like him while some are created strong in order to protect the weak.  David develops his talents with the support of Price and his son Joseph and, despite his cynicism, starts to try to use his powers to help people on need.The 6th sense was always going to be a hard show to follow up but Shyamalan has managed to make a film that is almost as clever, emotive, thoughtful and slow.  It even manages to end with a twist that is almost as good as sixth sense's was.  The story moves quite slowly, almost painfully at times, however I found this succeeded in making the film feel more thoughtful and less glamorous.  The director even shots the train crash in a very low key manner, as if to make the point that the film isn't about cheap spectacle or visual thrills.  Instead we follow David as he finds his abilities and gradually accepts them, all this side is fascinating although some of the side stories are a little dragged out.  The twist is only the icing on the cake and if you're into the characters the way I was then it is really impacting.  One bit of advice - don't think about it or try to work it out. Thinking about the twist will stop you enjoying the main story and will spoil the film for yourself.Willis is excellent - he doesn't set the world on fire, but he does a very low-key performance as a common man confronted with so much potential responsibility.  He doesn't ham it up but you know that there's things going on inside his head that reflect on his face.  Jackson is also really good - he maybe plays it a little too weird and should have been a bit more of a geek rather than an uptight art dealer sort.  Willis and Jackson should keep making films together from now on, cause even there worst collaboration so far has still been good - Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable, Die Hard With a Vengeance - it seems to be a winning partnership (Loaded Weapon 1 doesn't count as Willis is only in it for 5 seconds!).  A surprise addition to the cast is Eamonn Walker as Dr Mathison, it's a small role but he is a fine actor and deserves to be seen in big films (check him out in HBO's Oz for a real show of his abilities).Overall it's very slow and may frustrate some people, but if you got the 6th sense then you'll probably get this.  The story is moving and thoughtful and the final scene is merely the icing on a very fine cake.",Null,67,87,20 February 2002
Star Trek," Narrative-wise it has many faults but, in terms of summer blockbusters, it is accessible, fun, noisy and exciting with plenty of easy entertainment and spectacle
","Satirical news provider The Onion did a bit on their website the week this film came out with the headline that (roughly) read 'Fans slate new Trek film as 'fun' and 'accessible'' which not only allowed them to make fun of the previous Star Trek movies but also provide a good review of the new one. The new film doesn't deliver the goods when it comes to shots of men sitting talking around tables and other such Trek film standards but in fairness it could not do more to make it clear that this is a massive 'reboot' of the franchise that, with one thing or another, had stopped being of interest to a lot of casual viewers.The better Trek films have always been the ones that have a bit of pace to them and plenty of action (2 and 6 in my opinion) but even these have slower, duller moments that come with the territory. Mostly this film strips them out and leaves little but action across the running time, making it quite a spectacle to watch and why it is one of the summer blockbusters I decided to actually pay to see at the cinema rather than catch on DVD (Wolverine – I'll catch you when I can rent you). To borrow a worn cliché – the money is all there on the screen and almost without exception it looks great and it is very easy to get caught up in the speed and scale of it all. I particularly liked some of the more imaginative shots and techniques that it used, making it much more engaging and adding a further element of freshness (which, if we're frank, the franchise badly needed). I will temper this by saying that at times there seems to be spectacle for the sake of spectacle – such as the creatures on the ice planet and the silly car scene with a child Kirk at the wheel – and this does make me sit back a bit and see it as effects rather than something I should get emotionally engaged in but this is the minority of the film.Another injection is the comedy. While it is careful not to out and out mock the originals, there is much to laugh at with plenty of good lines that subvert some of the things we know from the original films ('out of the chair' being my favourite but there are plenty others). I can see why this may be a problem for some but it does make it a lot more fun to watch than the last few Trek films. That the narrative is not as good as the action or throwaway lines is not much of a surprise but it does still niggle a little bit, specifically when it has to rely on so much coincidence to keep things moving. The sheer entertainment value of the film meant that I didn't dwell on these things but at times the way the plot plays out does suggest a little bit of contempt for the viewer. Having said that, it is a smart move to have the time travel plot that allows for the time-line of events to come to be totally changed (a point that the film labours to point out in one scene, so that everybody gets it) because this allows them to make further films that focus on action over detail without the worry of messing up some existing Trek time-line detail.The cast surprised me in terms of how well they did – not least because the majority of them are not banner actors and indeed some of them I had never heard talk before (Urban's Bones is only known to me for his killer in the second Bourne film). Everyone does a sort of performance that allows us to know the character but doesn't get close enough to being an impression to be a worry. Pine fits the swaggering Kirk role really well and, although nothing here impresses me that much, he is very good as that. Likewise Quinto (Heroes) does a good job as Spock, managing better with the comedy impatience as well. Urban is as fun as Kelly ever was while Saldana makes for a very attractive Uhura (short skirt and all). Yelchin and Cho are quite fun but, as much as I like Simon Pegg, his wandering Scottish accent was so awful that it detracted from his otherwise funny performance. Both Greenwood and Bana add an older, tougher edge to the film, the latter being a particularly effective villain.The new Star Trek film may upset fans because it does jettison pretty much all of the existing story in favour of starting its own as well as throwing all its weight into action and fun at the expense of almost everything else, but for the vast majority of viewers this will be the film's big selling point. Narrative-wise it has many faults but, in terms of summer blockbusters, it is accessible, fun, noisy and exciting with plenty of easy entertainment and spectacle. Great summer blockbuster.",Null,7,19,29 May 2009
Fury," Singular and rather obvious (SPOILERS)
","This year has been a very busy one for me with time seeming to race by; indeed so much so that it did not occur to me it was getting close to awards season in early 2015. This thought entered my head a good part way into watching Fury; I was wondering why it was being the way it was and why it seemed so determined to be so very much one way, then I realized that this is one of many films that are mostly about awards success for all involved. The general narrative here is that we join an American tank during the final months of WWII, fighting their way as part of an assault into the heart of Germany. The small team are led by Don Collier, a tough and experienced commander, who has to keep his team focused, alive, and moving forward. A team where a death means that they are joined by green recruit Norman.This is the narrative, but really the film is not about a story so much as showing that 'war is hell', with lots of performances, speeches, gore, and predictability in the plotting. To say it is relentless in this is an understatement – it never stops pushing this message and if there is even a small chance to remind us, then the film takes us there. Every character will die once we start to engage with them; any character that the crew engage with will suffer and die, and so on. As an exercise in nihilism then the film does mostly work because it is relentless in how pointless it is, whether it be cruelty of man, child soldiers, the horror of random violence, the physiological effects of killing, or anything else, the film is really on point for these. The problem with it is not these aspects but rather than it pretty much contains nothing else.There is the feeling watching it that as well as a script supervisor and someone watching continuity, we also had someone making sure that every single 'war is hell' cliché was covered too. This continues through the film and to be honest the lack of anything else did make it less and less impacting as it went on – almost numbing, which in no way is the thing it was looking for. This is not to say that it is not professionally made and very authentic in its portrayal of life on the front, or the use of real tanks, but just that this cannot make up for the lack of content. Despite that so much of it is about the pointlessness of it all, the final section turns into a boys' own adventure where we see the SS mown down like we were still at war and this was a propaganda film showing the glory of death and sacrifice. It is such an odd change to the tone of the film, but at least it allows all of those involved an heroic Oscar clip death, and of course a brief (and ridiculous) moment of humanity to end the film on.The cast are all solid enough, but it is really hard to escape the feeling that they are all playing clichés to a certain extent. Pitt, Peña, Bernthal, Parrack, Isaacs, Henke, all do solid work but nothing really more than that in terms of characters. Lerman does as well as he can with a simple 'eyes of the audience' character. Technically the film is very impressive whether it be the use of authentic tanks, the scale of the film, or the sound and gore, which are flinch-inducing. None of this is an issue, it is just that there is little beyond it and as a result the film does feel like it is hammering the same point endlessly, rather than telling a good story and letting this come out of it.",Null,6,12,7 December 2014
Fight Club," Visually stunning, conceptually brave and only the odd sag
","Our narrator is a white-collar worker who has his life to a point it could be called normal.  His home is decked out in the pornography of IKEA catalogues and he is professional.  However he is somehow dissatisfied with his life as it is and drifts from various support groups faking disease just to get love and emotional outlet.  A chance meeting on an airplane with soap salesman Tyler Durden gives him pause and, when his flat is destroyed in an explosion, he turns to Durden for help.  Together they begin to move into a world that isn't commercially based, where pain helps them to feel more alive.  Together they start a small group called Fight Club where men can experience the thrill of a fight without the danger.  However the groups grow rapidly and begin to carry out subversive activities at large.  When confronted by our narrator, Durden disappears our narrator in charge of a semi-cult group that is operating without his knowledge.I didn't get round to seeing this film until it came to TV in the UK recently.  So over several years I had generally been told that it was a `great movie'  mostly by people who had HEARD it was a great movie rather than those who had seen it.  So I expected greatness and was taken a little aback by the fact that this wasn't a normal Hollywood film but something much more worth while.  The reason I'm surprised that it ranks so highly and did so well is that it requires concentration and thought.  The plot is basically a comedy, making fun of us.  That's how I saw it  that we are like the narrator but we must accept that this is our lives to some extent, to go to the other extreme is just as bad if not worse.  It is a very clever story and it only dipped in quality at one point for me  where the clubs first begin to become something more sinister (more!) and move into terrorism.Part of the reason it was so well watched is the stars but also the very cool direction that made it stand out to the student generation as something deep (even if they didn't get the film).  I think this ironic as they haven't hit the stage of our narrator and can't fully relate.  However the direction is praise worthy and Fincher was the best man for the job.  Full of clever shots and great images the film is a joy to see.  The one flaw I had was the sincerity of the film.  Many love it because it is anti-capitalist in nature, making fun of IKEA-love etc.  The film is preaching to us about this (and the other) extreme  but most people watching and making it will be living that exact life!  However this is minor and it became less as the film went on and mocked both ends of the scale.The stars do well and I wonder if they worried this would be too highbrow and flop?  Norton is simply a great actor when given the material and he delivers here.  Even with the more extreme actions (that aren't real) he carries them off as convincing.  Pitt enjoys himself well in the joint lead although his character is basically one dimensional (for obvious reasons). That said he is very strong and takes you with him as he gets more extreme. Carter is a weak link to me and I never really bought her character.  A shame as she is quite central but it doesn't spoil it too much.  Support cast are good, but putting a face like Meat Loaf in a very unusual role just made him stand out and distract from the role.Overall this is an excellent movie.  Even if you don't get it, it is still great fun to watch.  It is a brave story to try in a Hollywood film and it is superbly directed, acted and told.  Some may rave about it too much but it is well worth a look.  If only out of interest rather than to change your life.",Null,12,27,30 December 2002
Akira," Plot goes a little weird and drags at times but overall very good animation that set a trend
","In 1988 Tokyo is destroyed in a nuclear style blast.  30 years later the city has been rebuilt but has become troubled by youth and biker gangs.  An encounter with a powerful child leaves one of a gang, Tetsuo, injured and captured by the army.  They find his mind has powers that can be developed  however the lessons of the mysterious Akira are still fresh in their minds and the army know they must control his development.  Meanwhile Tetsuo's friend, Kaneda, fights corrupt politicians, a powerful military and the power of the opened human brain to get his friend back.When I went to see this film at a big cinema chain that I won't name, it had been over 10 years since I'd last seen the movie and could remember very little of it.  The screening was cancelled because the emergency lights couldn't be shut off (d'oh) but we were all offered free tickets for later. Coming back to it I hoped it would be worth the bother and, on the whole, it was.  This type of film is usually all visual flair and some messed up plot about demons etc.  Akira is almost that but rises about the average by being cleverer than that and by being one of the first of it's type.The animation is excellent  breathtaking cityscapes and futuristic effects. The violence is graphic but is nothing compared to modern Japanese standards.  It doesn't take away from the film and it all looks great.  The use of sound (or rather silence) is also effective with powerful silences at key moments really adding to the film.The plot goes a bit nuts at times and ends up with the body horror of many films of the genre.  However at it's core it is looking at the idea of humans using their full brain power and possible next steps for evolution. That doesn't mean it doesn't drag at all and several bits do go on too long  the ending in particular never seems to reach a closing point!  I felt it could easily have taken 20 minutes less and still done the same job.The only problem I had with the version I saw was the hammy American voice work.  It really made it feel clichéd.  However overall the film looks good and has some great action.  It may not be a classic film and the genre is a bit of an acquired taste but this is a solid film that (partly due to it's age) transcends many of the clichés the genre later acquired.",Null,4,9,24 November 2002
As Good as It Gets," A superior Hollywood piece of sentimentality
","Melvin is a romantic novelist who is a selfish manic compulsive who is rude and insulting to all he meets.  When Melvin's gay neighbour is beaten up and robbed, Melvin agrees to look after his dog.  The dog gives Melvin something to care about other than himself and his life is approaching normal until his regular waitress has to leave work to look after her asthmatic son and his neighbour wants his dog back.  Melvin starts to realise that his life needs others for more than just selfish reasons.The big Oscar winner for Jack is recent years is enjoyable if you come to it knowing what to expect.  The film is very sentimental but in a good way. The film is gently comic and amusing and the characters (although exaggerated) are winning and involving.  The telling is a little long winded at times and the film could have been shorter but it is still enjoyable.  It does tip over into sickly sentimentality at times and can be a bit syrupy but it comes with the territory.Nicholson is excellent and is the main reason it all works well.  His un-PC Melvin is funny but also a character that you can hate and pity on several occasions.  Kinnear is good because he is a solid understated character and not hammy or OTT like he can be.  Hunt is good but is left with the majority of the syrup and sentiment where the other characters get more share of the laughs.  Gooding Jr continues his trend of being good in over the top roles and is funny and happily avoids becoming a flaming gay stereotype.Overall this is a sentimental romantic comedy that is typical for the genre. The story wanders to it's point but the good cast, led by a great Nicholson, hold the whole thing together.  A superior piece of sentimentality.",Null,83,112,27 January 2003
Train to Busan," Solid horror which is intensely, well-paced, and does well with the characters, even if it is not as perfect as the hype suggests
","A lot of hype about this zombie film, and while I normally do not like these types of films (because they scare me), I decided to watch it. The plot sees a distant father escorting his young daughter back to her mother in Busan when some sort of outbreak occurs, and an infected gets onto the train. From there the film sees the infection spread across the train as an increasingly small group of survivors try to hold on in the hope that some stop will provide safety. In terms of narrative it is pretty straightforward, although at the same time it is a very limited space to make the action last for almost 2 hours â€“ particularly since the zombies are more or less unstoppable.The film uses some convenience with vision to give the characters some breathing room, but mostly it does this by making us care about the characters. While they are essentially fairly obvious genre standards in the main, they are reasonably well done to make us care for them and invest in their struggle. This adds weight to the stakes and the decisions made. The film uses this well, and delivers a pretty well paced film. I thought that it was just a touch longer than it needed to be, but it comes in waves, with nice touches of respite along with intense scenes of attacks and chases. With this the writing does well to come up with different ways to have the zombies almost about to attack quite often â€“ whether it be cracking glass, the dark of a tunnel, or so on. The emotional side of the film runs alongside this, and it is surprisingly affecting at times, although some key scenes at the end are a bit marred by the rather heavy use of music.The film does have blood and horror, but it is nicely light on the gore aspect; I dislike horror films which make a point of giving us real good looks at gore. Instead Busanhaeng lets the pace and tension and characters do the work, and I often found the pressure to be almost too much. The cast play well to this, whether it be the fear and regret of Yoo Gong or the gruffly likable Dong-seok Ma; even those playing more generic characters worked well enough to make it play. The film has received a lot of hype though, and this probably doesn't help it. It is a very good zombie movie, which does well to have plenty or horror but also delivers characters we feel for and want to survive, however it is still a zombie movie and mostly does just what you'd guess it will do â€“ albeit that it does it well.",Null,2,3,1 July 2017
Monster," Unpleasant and very little fun to watch but, despite some slips, it is a strong film and fair dramatisation of the story that is tragic, depressing and has nothing that will uplift you in any way
","Aileen Wuornos is a drifter and low rent prostitute. Turning up in a gay bar to spend her last $5 before killing herself brings about a chance meeting with the young and pretty Selby, trying to work out her own sexuality. While turning tricks for enough money for a motel, Aileen experiences a violent John, who she kills in response to a brutal rape attempt. With the money and the car she takes from him, Aileen takes Selby away with her for a life of partying and fun but, when the money runs out and the chances for real employment amount to zero, Aileen goes back out on the street. However faced with one more penis to sick, Aileen kills her John, starting a violent cycle of murder. A few months ago I saw Nick Broomfield's follow up documentary on Wuornos in which he followed her appeal and then her final days, hours and minutes before her death sentence was carried out. From that viewpoint I was left with no doubt that Wuornos was in no fit mental state to be executed even though she killed those men in cold blood  I suggest you see it for yourself because it is a film that will shake you deep about your sense of justice. Seeing Monster after that film puts me in a strange position where I felt that the film was unsure whether or not it felt sympathy for Aileen or judged her. I think it was a strength of the writing that it didn't seek to totally excuse or to condemn and ended up somewhere in the middle  acknowledging the totally sh*t life she had but never excusing her murders or making them less than the cold blooded executions that they were. In trying to dramatise this story the film just about manages to do it well, producing a film that is tragic, violent, idealistic and repulsive in equal measures. Occasionally I did wonder why I was watching such a bleak, depressing story when I'd already heard it from the woman herself, but it was worth it overall.The main criticism I would have was that Jenkins was making a dramatisation of this story, not a totally true one  so we don't know how brutally she was beaten that caused her to kill, nor do we know if she really wept and struggled to kill some of her victims; these are things that are added to the character that we can't be sure of, but I didn't feel they were over the top. As director, Jenkins is much better; she frames her shots well and she directs with style but without making it flashy over too obvious  some shots are so sparse and bleak that I felt they captured the tone really well. Of course the film is carried by a massive performance from Theron who, looks, sounds and acts just like the Wuornos that I have seen on the documentaries. So often trading on her looks and denied good roles, she takes to this with total enthusiasm and she thoroughly deserved the Oscar that she got for it. Ricci is equally as good but obviously is in the shadows for most of the film. Her character was never really explained and was treated more as our way in by Jenkins as opposed to being a major part of the story and the murders. Minor roles for Dern and Vince add interest but I did have to wonder why either of them were happy to accept such minor roles  certainly Vince is a much better actor and too well known to be given a role of 'John #5' and be given a hand job.Overall this is a powerful film that avoids swinging one way or another, although it is evident that, at times, Jenkins did find herself coming down on the side of Wuornos at some points  but happily never too heavily. The story is unpleasant and it is no fun to watch no matter what your view of the outcome is. It is greatly helped by two great performances, especially Theron, who I seriously doubt will ever get a role this good again.",Null,13,22,29 September 2004
Memento," A great film for directors or film editors
","Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is hunting the man who killed his wife. He has to do this while struggling with short term memory loss meaning he relies on photos of important things and tattooing important facts on his body.As everyone in the world knows the film runs backwards from the end for the majority - meaning that we, like Leonard see events without any knowledge of what has gone before. Like him we only have photos etc to help us. Unlike him we know what will happen and this makes it easier to follow the story. The film follows two streams - one where Leonard is telling someone over the phone about Sammy Jankis - a man who has the same memory condition. The second stream is the main narrative backwards.This film is amazing. If the story was told forwards then there would be very little here but the devil is in the editing. This is a director's film - the key lies in the editing of scenes and the many visual tricks that provide clues to the conclusion of the film. The main compliant everyone has is that the ending leaves too many questions unanswered - however on the first viewing this is not true. The first time you see it the ending is simply and devastating - the twist is not as breath taking as Usual Suspects or Se7en but it will profoundly move you. When you get over this you begin to pick back over the plot and the 'Sammy Jankis' section and you will find it difficult to come up with a water-tight solution. But to me that's one of the things to enjoy - the discussion with friends about the film and the fact that it stays with you for weeks after you've watched it.Pearce is excellent in the lead, I cannot believe this guy once was in Neighbours! He is a totally believable character and makes the audience feel so many different things throughout. Joe Pantoliano is excellent - but then he always is. Even Carrie Anne Moss is good. The strength of Moss and Pantoliano is that we don't know who they are - are they Leonard's friends, enemies, good, bad? - and they play on this ignorance wonderfully.The film is not in the top 250 because of the story but because of the editing. This is so different from anything else recently that it blows you away. It takes 15 minutes to get going but once you're in then you're in. This is worth watching as it shows how even a simple story can have a huge impact.",Null,9,17,29 October 2001
Inglourious Basterds," What it perhaps lacks in heart and total production it more than covers with tension in well-acted and well-shot scenes (SPOILERS)
","Looking forward to my viewing of this film I must confess that I expected it to be a particularly self-indulgent mess. It is an idea that has been mentioned since Tarantino first burst onto the scene and had a lot of choices in what he did next and it is not a short film and, to be frank, Kill Bill did not really do much for me at all. Basterds starts with more though because instead of the tiresome excess that Kill Bill Volume 1 brought with it, this film has much more patience to it. The plot is a bit of a mess and others are correct when they say that in a way he is referencing propaganda films of the period but it does run longer than perhaps it can really sustain. Having so many characters is one of the problems perhaps but in another way the length is necessary because most of the scenes do run quite slowly. Those expecting a big Hollywood action movie will be disappointed but ironically enough the film's main selling point is how well so many of the individual scenes are done.The dialogue sets it up because, whatever the language, it is mostly well written. Some is funny but mostly it works because it has a tension in each scene that is almost behind the dialogue – the ever present threat of violence or discovery or both. This makes you pay attention to each moment rather than being bored by the discussion taking place, because you know something is happening or something is being hidden behind the words, you're just not sure what will happen or who knows what. The cellar bar room scene is a perfect example because it does seem to have a lot of 'nothing' happening but while this 'nothing' is happening, the situation is feeling tenser and tenser. The same is true of the film's opening scene, the first face-to-face meeting of Shosanna and Landa and several other key scenes that have a real edge to them. Tarantino's direction is a big part of this working as well as it does on the screen. His shots are mostly very well framed and they add to the tension in a way that you notice because of how effective it is as a tool (although I suppose that could be taken as a criticism, if one is able to notice it happening). The dialogue scenes in particular are very well filmed because of the effect on the tension. The violence seems a little obvious and it is ironic that it is least effective when it is most gratuitous. Speaking of irony I would also have liked a bit more intelligence to the delivery of scenes where the viewer is clearly going to make a contrast in their head but yet the film offers nothing in the way of commentary or opinion; in particular this is telling where we are watching a Nazi propaganda film of Allies being gunned down to the crowd's delight, only to be put in the place of the in-film audience as we see Hitler and many other Nazis being gunned down and are probably having the same reaction.This lack of insight is sort of the problem with the film because it does feel like it is constantly of the moment and doesn't have a lot of heart behind it. The total film feels less important than the specific scene and, while this does mean that the running time runs by with lots of strong scenes, it somehow doesn't feel quite as good when you look back on it. A quibble perhaps, when it is so engaging moment to moment, but it is still the impression I was left with. The cast are not so prone to problems though and indeed they seem to work best because of the focus on the scenes and the dialogue rather than anything else. For all the names in the film, it is Waltz who dominates the screen. His insincere facade and his playful menace makes many of his scenes occur on the edge of a knife and he is great every time he is on. Laurent herself does very good work but her material is not quite as strong as she has to carry more of the 'heart' of the film – a 'heart', as I said, which is not particularly strong. Pitt has a lot of fun and his sections of the film add to the dark comedy of the piece. Brühl is enjoyable in his turn as well – doing good work with Laurent. The supporting cast beyond this is mixed but mostly solid enough to do the specific jobs they are asked to do; personally though I found Roth, Myers, Novack and a few others to be distractions rather than additions to the film.I went in to Inglourious Basterds unsure of what to expect from it and when I was finished I was quite pleased with what I had seen. It is a rather hollow film as a whole but it is surprisingly engaging thanks to how well the majority of the scenes are put together. What it perhaps lacks in heart and total production it more than covers with tension in well-acted and well-shot scenes with Tarantino's usual good use of music. Not a great total film perhaps but a very good demonstration of Tarantino's skills in how well it works as you watch it. Certainly an improvement on Kill Bill.",Null,9,18,9 December 2009
Underworld," Derivative stuff without too much of specific interest but does enough to tick the boxes for the teenage male target audience
","When their feared and ruthless leader Lucian is killed, the Lycan clan is scattered. The Vampires claim victory in the war but set out to hunt the remaining Lycans to the point of extinction. Selene is one of a group of vampire warriors grouped together for just this task. They stalk and kill Lycan but, when a simple trail into a subway station turns into a massive gun battle, Selene uncovers evidence of a possible pack living underground but, more worryingly, finds the Lycan were in the subway station to try and capture a specific human. Meanwhile Lucian is not as dead as rumoured and instead plots his next action in the war as Selene tries to figure out what the Lycans want with human Michael.The trivia entry on the IMDb page for this film states that it was sued for copyright infringement just before release. It also states that a sequel and prequel were greenlit on Canadian ticket sales alone. Both these things I can easily believe because at times the film is so derivative that many different people could have attempted to sue, plus it ticks so many boxes for what the teenage market wanted that the studios were bound to come back for more as long as it sold. Of course moaning that an action blockbuster is derivative is a bit like moaning that fire burns  it comes with the territory. The pitch about Romeo/Juliet is nonsense as the story contains very little of this and what there is is weak. The overall story is good enough to hold the action together though, even if it is nothing that clever or interesting.Current Die Hard 4 director Wiseman directs well enough, capturing the Gothic feel of it while also providing all the cool things that the target audience would be looking for. So we have lots of tight PVC (particularly around the bum of Beckinsale) and lots of action to get them in. The action is alright but it does feel like the Wachowski brothers could have also been reaching for their lawyers  particularly looking at the opening subway shoot out, which screams Matrix from every frame. The cast are reasonable good and benefit from some strange but effective casting choices. Beckinsale is in great shape and does the whole 'sexy, dark martial arts babe' thing really well. Shame more wasn't asked of her in terms of character but it is what it is. Speedman is too bland to really write too much about so I won't. Sheen is at a disadvantage with me because the last few times I have seen him he has been playing Tony Blair to the point where I find it hard to separate them. He is quite good but it is hard not to be distracted by him playing a leader involved in an endless war  particularly one who continues to be leader no matter what happens to his clan. Nighy was a good choice and is effective in his role  mostly because he really fits the look. Fellow Belfast ('I'm outta here') lad Brolly is poor. The rest of the cast features notable turns from Myles, Prison Break's Miller and Grevioux (one of the writers) with a voice so deep that I felt his lines before I heard them.Overall then a typical teenage-boy-targeted summer blockbuster. Monsters, sexy martial arts girls in tight clothes and lots of bullets = box office returns and the promise of more. If you are in target audience and just looking for this then this will deliver just what you expect it to. Just don't expect the story or characters to be anything that good or for anything about it to be different or better than what you would see in lots of other films all aiming for the same audience.",Null,1,6,18 December 2006
Amistad," Interesting and emotionally impacting  just not at the same time
","1839 sees a cargo of slaves rise up and take over the ship Amistad from their masters. They point the ship back in the direction of their homeland but only succeed in ending up in America. There they are taken into custody and charged with the murder of the crew. Those in favour of abolishing slavery pick up their cause but there are several other claims of ownership on this 'cargo'. As the abolitionists' lawyer Baldwin joins them he tries at first to make it a simple matter of legal possession, highlighting the fact that the slaves came from Africa and were not born into slavery  thus making them illegally acquired. However as the case becomes more complex and political, Baldwin turns to one of the slave, Cinque, to help build his case.Opening with the well-directed and fragmented overthrow of the Amistad, this film immediately steps back into a slightly more talkative state that continues for the majority of the film. Later in the film we flashback to the slave ships for a vivid and devastating look at the treatment and murder of the slaves during their journey but mostly the film is an interesting courtroom drama with this very intriguing case in history at its heart. As specific parts of the film, this is all well and good because there isn't really a weak part of the film but yet it tends not to hang together as well as it should. The courtroom stuff is interesting but you find yourself drawn into the detail of the case and forget the wider picture of the cruelty and tragedy of slavery. The film occasionally jumps back to that to remind us but it doesn't manage to weave this across the whole story. So I can understand the criticism of the film (or rather subdued praise) because it does at times lose itself into a polished drama rather than an emotional look at a period in history.Spielberg's direction is best when given moments of style or horror to work with but otherwise he delivers a nice sense of place and period while wrapping the whole lot in a rather sentimental score. It is a rather disappointingly delivery though because it is quite, well, 'ordinary' at times. The cast are impressive on paper and mostly good on the screen. Although he is way down the fame ladder at this point, Hounsou is impressive as Cinque. He brings a lot out with his face and body and he creates a character long before he has been given subtitles or a translator to aid him. McConaughey is reasonably good alongside him and supports the factual courtroom side of the film. Hopkins is a little bit hammy and overdoes the doddery nature of his character. Ejiofor is as good as he nearly always is, even with a comparatively small role. Freeman, Hawthorne, Paymer, Postlethwaite, Skarsgård and Paquin all add famous names and solid turns but the material doesn't really need all of them, although I suppose the worthy nature of the story made them easy to get.At the least though, this is an interesting film that is delivered in a professional and polished way. It has a few moments of searing emotion but mostly it is just interesting and is wrapped in a rather obvious score. Worth seeing for what it does well, but perhaps a little disappointing (considering the calibre of people involved) for what it does not.",Null,0,3,18 December 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The action and nostalgia help cover a weak narrative and under-developed/used characters (SPOILERS)
","The power of the Star Wars brand is significant to say the least, and it is this that carries this film, although to say it does it alone is to do it a disservice – although it is a prequel to the original trilogy, this is not 'the' prequels in terms of quality. Unlike those films, this one gets the action and impact right. It has been said it has been made for adult, and it has in so much that it is not aimed at children – although those are not the same thing.The plot dovetails into the original film nicely. There is a lot of nostalgic pleasure to be had seeing the various links to the original film, and there are plenty of direct references as well as 'easter eggs' in there to be had. This is different from the plot being good though, because mostly it isn't great. The action and movement covers for it, but mostly it seems to be a bit contrived in making scenes happen, and it doesn't really produce an organic feel to the end. In terms of tone it does have a good 'war movie' element – and the fact that pretty much everyone in it dies adds to this, but yet it didn't feel as dark as the content suggested.Partly this is down to the plot not being as compelling or tight as it could have been, but it is also down to the characters not really winning me over. In some cases this is because they feel really undeveloped (Jyn, Andor) or just underused (almost everyone else). The action is great, and has plenty of effects while still managing to stay out of 'cartoonish' territory. The recreation of characters from the original film is also impressive – still ever so slightly 'uncanny valley' but impressive nonetheless. Credit to the sets, costumes, and casting too – it really has the look and feel of the original film; not just in the recreation of the sets, but in smaller things like the abundance of British actors (and in particular the use of generally older British men in the Empire's crews).I did enjoy Rogue One for what it was, however at the same time I know that the nostalgia, branding, and big budget action did a lot to keep me entertained, even while the writing, characters, and narrative were all short of what they could have been. It is much better than the other prequels, but it is certainly not the Empire equivalent that some claim.",Null,4,6,29 March 2017
Captain Marvel," Fairly bland even if it has its moments here and there
","Probably doesn't matter that I watched this film after Endgame, as I doubt knowing that Danvers is not the solution hinted at in the post-credit sequence of Infinity War. Supposedly the most powerful of the characters, and the first major solo character to be a woman, it is surprising that the film doesn't do more or take more risks. That the character continues to disappoint in Endgame is no great surprise now, given how so-so this film is. It has all the budget, stars, effects, and production standards of the wider franchise, but it somehow doesn't come together as a whole - and I'm not entirely sure why.Larson is maybe part of it, as mostly she fails to have any genuine character. The narrative structure I think made it hard for her to do it, as she is never allowed to be human apart from very brief flashbacks. Outside of this she is powerful and in-charge, which just means she is pretty dull due to lacking humour, risk, danger, or edge. Same could be said of the film as a whole, as it feels incredibly 'safe' in what it does. Jackson and a cat are the high points, otherwise it is not a particularly good standalone film, and certainly does little in the context of the series. I was sort of glad I had not seen it between Infinity War and Endgame, as the moment of those was good, and this might have taken the wind out of it a little.It is too expensive and slick to be a bad or weak film, but certainly it is not a good one. Even within the MCU it feels like a hollow affair, offering spectacle and noise, but almost nothing in the way of heart, and little in way of humour and thrills.",Null,4,8,22 September 2019
Coraline," Dark and inventive film even if it is perhaps too scary for particularly young children who will not understand the context and only see images
","I had not heard of the book on which this film is based but the involvement of Selick was enough to convince me that it was worth a look even before the uniform spread of five star reviews of it starting appearing in the media. I wanted to see it even more when some of the same media outlets starting having 'complaints' from parents who had taken their toddlers to an animated film safe in the knowledge that NOBODY had ever, ever made an animated film that wasn't aimed at toddlers. Well, actually it turns out that, as well as countless other films, this is not a film for very young children – by which I mean children who are not yet old enough to be able to cope with a narrative and be able to take their heads into a story, there is not a specific age on that, which is why generally one expects parents to do the job of weighing that up on behalf of the humans they created.As I'm not a parent I'll not pretend to be able to advise others but I certainly know that the film will scare kids because it is dark enough to make me enjoy it on that level as an adult. This is not to say that it is not a family film though because outside of those being overly protective, this is the modern equivalent of a Gothic fairytale or a ghost story around a campfire – something that will chill and grip a child with a fear but not to the point where reason or hope goes out the window. As such it is a great film because the story is strong at the core with an engaging scenario that reminds me of the 'ideal' world of David Lynch, where the darkness is only just below the surface. So it is for Coraline where the supposedly perfect family behind the door turns out to be much more sinister. Throughout the telling the delivery makes it fun and engaging – with a patient pace that isn't ever slow but never seems to be rushing things. The 'message' isn't rammed down our throats but is there for children old enough to think through what they are watching.Although I didn't see it in 3D the film still manages to look great. Whether it is the warmth and softness of the perfect family home, the weird and wonderful creatures or the effects in the later reveals of the 'other' mother. It all looks great with the animation being technically impressive but the imagination also being a big part of it. Some of the images will be too dark for younger children but, aside from providing age-appropriate scares for older children, it is well pitched. The voice work helps things without being particularly distracting in the way that some of the 'who is that' voice work in other animated films can be. Fanning seems to have gotten past her precocious-sounding stage and does a solid turn in the title character. Hatcher is better though, capturing sweetness while being sinister and easily being evil later. Saunders, French, Hodgman, David and McShane all do good turns but again do so without being themselves, if you know what I mean.Coraline is not for everyone and should certainly not be seen as being for all ages simply because it is animated. It is an engagingly dark fantasy with content and imagery that provides an effective Gothic fairy tale for those older children able to process it beyond what they see. Of course it is another sign of quality that, in the absence of any child of any age, adults can still easily enjoy it.",Null,7,12,6 June 2009
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Sweet like candy but no more than that  unmemorable
","Against her father's wishes Pelagia marries her fisherman fiancé just before he goes off to war. When she stops getting replies to her letters everyone fears the worst but she holds out hope that he is still alive. Meanwhile the Greek's initial defeat of the Italian army causes Hitler to support a full attack that leaves Greece and it's island inhabited by Italian soldiers. Pelagia and her father find themselves housing Italian Captain Corelli, who loves music and is charming. While Pelagia hates Italians and loves her husband she finds herself falling for the Captain over time.At the time of release there was plenty of dating couple who went to see this film and there was also a boost in the tourist trade in Greece, accompanied by lots of television travel programmes talking about the islands and the film. These two things were in my mind when I sat to watch the film tonight and I quickly understood why they were the case. Firstly the reason so many travel shows picked it up is because the film makes the place look great! Each shot is full of warm colour and the locations are picture-book all the way through. The idyllic feel that the location brings is also part of the wider film with a story that is sweet but high on Hollywood gloss. I have not read the book and have no intention of reading the book but I understand from other's comments that the screenplay has lost some 'difficult' elements and focused on the romance in the story. Ignoring this (as many who have not read the book will be able to) the film is just like the landscape  sweeping, easy on the eye, nice and ultimately quite unmemorable.This explains why it was a popular date movie or, to use that expression I generally dislike, chick-flick. The romance is simple and sweet and it is enjoyable on that level; I can't say it touched me on a deep level (or any level) but it was sweet and I quite liked it. Towards the end it gets harder and more about the war than the romance but I felt this was too sudden a change that had been left too late in the game to fully work  it was too much of a sea change for me to fully go with it.The cast are mostly pretty and OK just like the landscape. Cage is too nice to be true but still tries hard; his Italian accent has corny 'mama-mia' moments but is generally OK. Cruz is fairly bland and doesn't bring a great deal to the film other that her looks (which personally don't appeal to me that much) and Christian Bale is given little to do considering how good an actor he is generally. Hurt is good value as always and the support cast fill in the gaps well even if few of them have anything approaching what could be called a character.Overall this is a sweet film that turns bitter for the final quarter of it's running time  a change in mood that is quite difficult when it occurs due to it's suddenness. However it manages to stay quite sweet and romantic despite running with a simplified script and a glossy approach to everything. It is quite unmemorable and I doubt I shall ever watch it again but I found it to be like the landscape  easy on the eye and rather pleasing to watch without touching me on more than a superficial level.",Null,10,21,31 May 2004
Shakespeare in Love," It doesn't always make sense but it's a witty comical romance
","In London in 1593 the theatre industry is shaky for Will Shakespeare.  He's lost his muse and is struggling to write his new comedy `Romeo and Ethel the pirates daughter'.  Lady Viola Lesseps, frustrated by the theatre's lack of women dresses as a man and lands the part but also Shakespeare's heart. With the production in motion Shakespeare must battle forbidden love, debts and troublesome actors to produce his play.A far cry from a traditional piece this sees a colourful blend of tradition, comedy, modern wit and a sheer abandonment of history in favour of entertainment.  Even the cast shows the mix of theatre and populist culture, in it's inclusion of stage actors and a range of TV comedians from such as `the fast show'.  The story is absurd, but happily Stoppard and everyone else knows it and lets us know it as well.  For example Viola's poor `man' disguise is revealed by a boatman who says to Shakespeare that it wouldn't have fooled a child.  (Although in fairness Shakespeare himself used this device on many occasions).The story is full of romance and comedy is equal measures and is really well pulled off by all the cast.  The problems of the laziness in the script are well handled - as Henslowe keeps telling us `it'll work out, it always does'.  For example, Queen Victoria appears in full gear in a theatre - but had gone unnoticed for the whole performance.The cast are superb and play the whole thing with a huge amount of fun that is befitting the material.  Fiennes manages something that he rarely does - he is good!  Paltrow is OK, but definitely doesn't convince in the scenes where she acts as Juliet in the play.  Affleck is better but you can't help but feel that both American stars are only there to make it sellable in the US.  Judi Dench is only onscreen for about 10 minutes all told and she isn't that good - she is very cold and distant, not really allowed to give her Queen any character.  She won an Oscar but lets be honest - she was given that out of sympathy for her not getting it for her superb Queen Victoria in Mrs Brown.  She didn't deserve it for this, but then I suppose most Americans aren't smart enough to work out that this was a different film! The rest of the cast are really good made up of quality stage names and comedians - Rush, Wilkinson, Callow, Anthony Sher mix effortlessly with Martin Clunes and Simon Day.It's all a bit daft but it's done with such a sense of fun that it almost carries it off.  Enjoyable tosh posing as theatre!",Null,2,8,8 February 2002
Dawn of the Dead," A great pace covers the weaknesses in plotting
","Returning from a busy day in the hospital, Ana spends time with her husband when a neighbours daughter comes into the house and attacks her husband. He dies before returning to life and attacking Ana. She runs and escapes in her car, driving through a neighbourhood rife with violence and fires.  After crashing her car, she hooks up with a group of armed survivors who take refuge in a mall.  The group settle in and fortify their position as an army of the undead gather outside.Before I start my review, let me just say that this will be biased as I am always easily won over by zombie movies.  The fact that they just keep coming (fast or slow), lack character and only want to kill really just freaks me out.  So I tend to get easily scared by the genre (even if `enjoy' is perhaps not the right word) and be easily more negligent towards their faults.  Despite telling myself that I wouldn't bother with this film as it would scare me, I went for it anyway in a fit of `confront your fears' type of stupidity!  The film starts with a creepy opening and pretty much manages to keep the pace up for the whole film.  It, like the zombies, moves fast and brutally throughout and is very, very tense.Others have complained about the lack of gore - however I found the graphic exploding heads to do that more than enough for my tastes!  Better than gore is the atmosphere.  The use of news footage is not original but it succeeds (along with the aerial view of the town) in creating the impression of a world turning to sh*t.  I don't know about you but this scares me and the film did it well.  The speed of the zombie attacks makes for a thrilling ride and it did make me very tense - Snyder managed to make the whole film a threat (especially for a first time director) and I honestly have a very stiff neck a day after seeing this simply because my body was tensed up for the whole film!The pace of the film also serves to cover the real problems in content and plot.  Unlike the original there is no satirical swipe on consumerism - the fact that the zombies are just wandering aimlessly around the mall like they used to in life is pretty much ignored here - but times are very different now I guess.  The plot itself also has quite a few stupid moments where the characters act in a way you know they wouldn't in real life.  For example people go on suicide missions for little real reasons and you can tell that the script is just doing it to create more action.  However, when you are into it, these things don't really seem to matter.  The film may be a little silly when you think about it but it does have a good ending - downbeat and realistic (or at least as realistic as it can be!) and left me with no hope of a happy ending - in this regard it is everything that `28 Days Later..' is not.The cast is good even if the script places their characters secondary to the action.  Polley is used to slightly more substantial roles but still does well here.  Rhames is lumbered with a religious background that is never explained, but he is a great presence throughout.  Weber is the standout role however.  His character is a slightly less cartoon version of Evil Dead's Ash.  He is the unwilling hero but yet he seems to accept all the obstacles he comes across.  He also manages to be one of the group that the audience cares about - most of them are fodder and we know it!  Phifer is a good actor but seemed too `gangster' to really be driven to this degree by his family.  The rest of the support cast are mostly just there to get eaten but they do OK.Overall this is not a great film - but it is an effective one.  As a film it lacks subtext, comment and plot logic. However as a thriller it is fast paced, gripping and tense with a satisfyingly bleak conclusion.  Snyder does a good job as a first timer and creates an atmosphere that is gripping even if it lacks originality.  Like I said, I don't deal with zombie movies very well and am easily scared but I reckon that this should satisfy many a Saturday night thrill-seeking crowd even if it does nothing for your brain apart from it's risk getting eaten.",Null,106,164,10 April 2004
Iron Man 2," Distracting blockbuster fare but lacks the spark and flow of the first film
","Although it was of course a summer blockbuster with all the flaws that came with it, I did really enjoy the first Iron Man film for what it did well. It was breezy, light and fun and it made it an easy film to like. I was hoping for more of the same from Iron Man 2 then and it is a little disappointing to find that it cannot quite replicate the same effect. Normally I would not be overly bothered by plotting in a summer action movie but for me this is sort of the problem with IM2. It is not that the plot is bad or complicated, it is just that it seems to lack a flow to it, meaning that it stutters along quite badly, robbing it of the light touch and sense of fun that the first film relied on.We have a Russian scientist out for revenge on the Stark corporation, Stark struggling with blood poisoning from his power source, Pepper Potts taking control of the company, Justin Hammer competing for military contracts, Stark refusing to share his technology with the US military (much to the chagrin of Rhodes) and Nick Fury continuing to try and recruit Stark to his Avengers initiative. In fairness the film is not as 'busy' as it could have been with all these characters and aspects bumping around, but it does give it a rather messy feel and the film never feels comfortable until the final action sequence around the Expo. At this point there are goodies and baddies and everyone is pulling together in the same direction and it means nothing distracts and nothing breaks up the motion in the way that happens through most of the film.This is not the same as saying the film is bad, just that it doesn't quite have that fresh feel of the first film. Stark's excesses are overplayed to the point where he is a bit hard to like. The first film balanced this well (thanks to a great turn from Downey Jr) with his wit and character taking the load, but here the first part of the film gets a bit tiresome as Stark is in one glamorous location after another without much for the viewer to 'like' about him. This turns around gradually but again never to the point of being as good as the first film. Downey Jr is still good though and he uses his laid-back charm to good effect when he gets the chance – it is not his fault that this film is 'busier' than the first in terms of characters, so he has less time to spread out as he once did. Cheadle is OK but I would have preferred Howard in this role; the former just seems too hard and one-note here. Paltrow is amusing in her minor role while Johansson plays to her strengths by being firey in her hair and eyes while wearing a cat suit – nothing to say on her performance as an actress but she seems happy being a sexualised action figureen so who am I to question? Rockwell is great fun though. He plays well against Downey and he brings good humour to his parts. Rourke is a nonsense but an enjoyable one, he has a good presence and his character is at least interesting, which goes some way to making up for his rather silly costume. Favreau's appearance in front of costume doesn't do much as his comedy moments aren't that funny, while Jackson is determined to keep showing up in things being 'Samuel MF'ing Jackson' over and over again. Shandling and Slattery are nice bits of casting.It isn't an actors' film though and it is mostly about the effects. The main CGI moments are great – free flowing, well delivered, quite exciting and technically impressive. Ironically some of the 'backdrop' effects (like where the cast are clearly getting out of a car somewhere in the world other than where they appear to be) are pretty poor – not quite 1950's back projection but still they don't look real, although it is just a minor quibble.Overall Iron Man 2 is a reasonably enjoyable summer blockbuster. It has stars, it has noise, it has cheeky humour and all your money is up there on the screen to be enjoyed. Unfortunately for the franchise it has too much clutter in it that breaks up the flow of the film and makes it too heavy to feel as fresh and fun as the first Iron Man film. It will still please the target audience and it will work as a Friday night DVD but the studio's efforts to pull the Avengers together has actually hurt this specific film, making it less enjoyable than the first film by virtue of losing sight of what worked there by piling too much on top of it.",Null,3,7,18 September 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Did we need a fouth?
","Following the disappointment of alien3's performance and the death of Ripley, it was thought that the alien franchise was finished, going out on a high - the completion of the films and Ripley, with Ripley dying in the struggle to kill the alien that had become her whole life.Once the potential earnings had been calculated, it probably didn't take very long to decide to piece together a sequel.  This was always going to be messy - can you do an Alien movie without Weaver? How can you bring your main character back to life? Alien v's Predator anyone?!  Once they pieced together a script and got Weaver on board it was all set to go.Let me lay my cards on the table - I don't like this film.  Yes, the direction is brilliant visually with some great set pieces.  The story is good  for some of the film, turning the conspiracy story up to 10 with aliens being bred in captivity, but after the aliens get out the story is mostly a chase and kill deal and then goes onto some nonsense about a new breed of alien that looks like milky bars!Apart from the visuals and the conspiracy angle this is pretty ordinary stuff, it doesn't deserve to be part of such a classic series.  As a stand alone film it is OK but an Alien movie can't be just OK.  The performances are so-so, Weaver enjoys the fact that her character is allowed to be more powerful than usual but this doesn't actually make it a better performance, the fact that Jeunet fills the film with the French actors from his other films makes it slightly more interesting but no less average.Just because Jeunet put the guns back into the Alien series doesn't make it good.  There isn't anywhere near the tension of the other movies and there's certainly no horror.  A good sci-fi movie but it could be any movies, there's nothing that really means it could only be an Alien movie here.",Null,25,44,17 October 2001
World War Z," Good large set-pieces but not so good at producing consistent tension and fear
","I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies, not because I don't like them but rather because they seem to easily have an effect on me, chilling me to the bone and staying with me for days (no walking into dark rooms for me). As a result I put off watching World War Z but I was still interested in seeing such a big budget zombie film. The plot sees some form of outbreak and, well, you know what happens. No sooner has Gerry Lane rescued his family from one city, than he is rescued by his old UN employers who want him to help lead a mission to try and find a solution by escorting a doctor to South Korea. No pressure, but the space for his family in safe haven does rely on him saying 'yes'.After some very brief character establishment (references to 'old job', happy family image etc), we get the first of many set-pieces as an outbreak sweeps across the city and, like many of the set-pieces, it is pretty good stuff. There is plenty of money on the table, lots going on and the scale of it all is suitable for a plot about a global outbreak. The problem is that it never really feels like more than this and the bits in between are not great. The biggest criticism that I can offer is that it did nothing to be other than make me watch the noisy scenes in the way I would with any big blockbuster – and I remind you that I am normally chilled by zombie movies. Here I felt that apart from once or twice, it didn't really do the tension or the horror well, it almost felt too slick, too expensive.To give a contrast, an outbreak in a closed car park in 28 Weeks Later was really horrific to me (in a good way) but here the one on a plane didn't bring that same feeling. It is hard for me to put my finger on it, but for sure something was missing here. The plot doesn't help – jumping around the world without much linkage and asking the viewer to just go with it; perhaps I would if I had cared more, but everyone apart from Brad Pitt seemed so disposable – just fodder for the attack shots, so I did get numb and also feel remote from it all. Technically it is great and it really is well shot and put together, but it is just the lack of atmosphere that hurts it the most.It is a big expensive movie though and as a blockbuster it works well enough to give it a go, but it really never works in the ways that would have made it a much superior film.",Null,21,33,24 May 2014
Seven Years in Tibet," The lack of character in Harrer is a problem and produces a film that is OK but doesn't do anything well (Minor spoiler regarding final shot of film)
","Fleeing the pressures of his family life, Heinrich Harrer joins an expedition to climb the Himalayas and raise morale in Nazi Germany by claiming it as a victory for Hitler. However, he and the others are captured by the British army during the climb and sent to a POW camp. After many attempts at escape, Heinrich and a group of others manage to escape. With his friend Peter, Heinrich reaches Tibet only to be turned away. They get away from their guides and return to Tibet in disguise and are taken into the Holy City. After some time Heinrich is granted an audience with the young Dalai Lama, beginning a journey of discovery for both of them that continues through peace and occupation by China.One of many films of the period that sought to raise awareness surrounding Tibet, this film is reasonably effective in that regard despite being deeply flawed in others. In terms of delivering a broad history of Tibet and China this film is reasonably OK and is interesting if simplistic. The focus on the (true) story of Harrer helps gives the film structure but also creates weaknesses of it's own. Focusing on this character makes the film more about him than Tibet itself and he isn't really very interesting (although early events in his story here are). The film fudges over his Nazi beliefs and would have us believe that he is nothing to so with any of it – a stand that many have attacked as simply not true but one that was needed to sell the film to modern audiences (and get Pitt on board!). I have no problem with them leaving this out; no, my problem with Harrer is that he is mostly bland and his tale is played OVER Tibet rather than being used as a gateway into the wider story. It is not uninteresting but it is a little overlong and the story is hard to really buy into emotionally because it is such a flawed mix.The direction uses the scenery well and also produces some exciting early scenes on the mountain, but the bigger battle sequences failing to really spark into life. In fairness to what the film was trying to do, a big part of the problem is Pitt himself. Early on he tries to play his character a little unpleasant (I assume to make his transformation more obvious) but he only comes across as his usual swaggering, slightly arrogant character. This doesn't sit well with me and I didn't rate his performance very much at all. And I don't care if his pronunciation of 'Himalayas' is correct, it's still hilarious and I was very glad when he stopped saying it! Pitt's failure to make a person of Harrer is a major reason that I wasn't ever engaged in the film and the final shot of him with his son was just a perfect example of how uninvolving his character had been. He is rather hammy, prone to irrational traits in his character and unsuited to the film.Thewlis is better but given less to do – however his flirting with Tsamchoe is not convincing. Wong is poorly used and his famous face in such a role is a distraction. Wangchuk is good as Kundun and is fun but how true to reality his portrayal is.Overall this is an OK film but it doesn't do anything particularly well. The stuff about Tibet is told in very broad strokes and will not tell most people anything that they don't already know. The focus on the character and story of Harrer also fails because he is not really an engaging character; part of this is due to a flawed script but a bigger contributory factor is a pretty poor performance from Pitt, who doesn't suit the role one little bit.",Null,5,7,16 May 2004
The Hunger Games," Surprisingly safe and sanitised – lacks the horror, satire and commentary it could and should have had
","There was a great deal of hype and fuss when The Hunger Games came out as a film and perhaps I should have known I was not target audience because up till then I had never heard of the book series (or indeed that a film was being made). Although with the usual hoopla that goes with any large film, quite a few critics I respect gave it surprisingly good reviews and I decided I would check it out at some point as it seemed to offer more than just a copy of Battle Royale for American teenagers. With all the fuss (and teenage audience) I was very happy to let it go by in the cinemas and instead I waited for the DVD.The film offers a lot of potential and this potential is evident from the start because it sets out its stall to be many things. Firstly there is plenty of room for satire by virtue of this exaggerated futuristic world where this annual murder is presented as both entertainment and also as a way of punishing the masses and keeping them in their place while those with the power enjoy the best of life. Secondly there is the opportunity to draw the audience into being a viewer of this very thing and then confronting us with the horror of what it really means so that there is at least a part of us questioning what we're finding entertaining. I wasn't looking for this to be some incredibly dark film that spits out an audience full of self-loathing and introspection, but I did expect it to be intelligent and impacting on some level to make it stand out from being just a teen-friendly adventure story.The film itself surprised me by falling far short of what it could have been and squandering or ignoring most of the things of the potential it had. In terms of the satire, it never convinced me of the world it had created – it seemed unnecessarily excessive and didn't have enough truth to it to make me believe. I got the impression that it wasn't particularly interested in making the world function as a real place either – just that it was on screen was enough. As a place for commentary or digs at real things, it wasn't that it picked easy targets or easy shots, it was more a matter of it not really having much interest in saying anything beyond a few very basic things. This is a problem not only because it wasted potential but also because the first hour or so of this film is entirely in this world.The second hour is within the games itself and as such it does have dramatic moments as one would expect (it is after all, an expensive Hollywood thriller), however these are fewer than I would have liked and also a lot less impacting – I watched most of it with a removal that I shouldn't have had. The delivery of children violently murdering other is only horrifying in regards how sanitised and unhorrific it is. I wasn't looking for it to be really gory or to revel in the blood, but it certainly should not have been something that I watch without any reaction. This lack of horror (even just emotional horror) leaves the game as a rather hollow affair which eventually turns into a standard thriller where we root for the 'good' kids over the 'bad' kids, even though it would have been stronger to have not drawn that very easy line.The performances are mostly solid even though the majority have little to work with. Lawrence is a good actress and she adds a weight to her character tat doesn't seem to come from anywhere but her. I liked her throughout – even terrible 'fire' special effects seemed unable to make her look bad. The supporting cast aren't able to bring as much as her to the table – even though there are plenty of big names here. The majority of the other children are carefully cast and given exits from the story that befits the easy-road approach to the plot.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I was surprised to find that the words sanitised, safe and standard were the ones that kept going through my mind considering I was watching a globally successful satire that uses the murder of children by other children as its core plot. As it is The Hunger Games comes off as a lot of ideas that have been done better elsewhere and any teeth it may have had are all smoothed down and buffed into a consumer friendly product that will undoubtedly become a smash franchise – my only hope is that the next film can deliver some of its promise and not just churn out something as safe, generic and frankly unmemorable as this one.",Null,7,11,3 September 2012
12 Monkeys," Imaginative, clever, engaging and very enjoyable  one of the best sci-fi's I've seen
","In the future humans exist underground, the surface having become uninhabitable due to the release of a virus years before in 1996. The ruling classes are scientists and large sections of the population are held as prisoners in tiny cells; prisoners who 'volunteer' to help work out what happened back in 1996 that killed off 99% of the population. Requiring information about the visit, James Cole is sent back to 1996 to gather what information he can. However, sent to 1990 by accident, Cole finds himself in a mental hospital where he meets From the very start this film marks itself out as being very much a Terry Gilliam product and those who hate his work will probably dislike this film for the same reason. However, pleasing people like that is not my concern and 12 Monkeys is actually one of Gilliam's most accessible films as it sets his imaginative style within a narrative that is satisfyingly complex and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. The story is not perfect though, the connection to the start is nice but the ultimate twist behind the virus just seems to have been thrown in to keep the film tidy; a minor complaint though because even then the main thrust of the story (Cole) keeps it together. The twisting plot plays with both Cole's and our sense of reality and it is genuinely gripping from start to finish Gilliam's direction is superb, whether it be the realistic world of the 1990's filmed with clever angles and shots or the wonderfully twisted world of the future, it is all excellent and was such a pleasant find in my local cinema at the time.The film benefits from great turns from the cast. Willis was having a bit of a career resurrection in the mid-90's when several films showed us that he could actually act  for me, 12 Monkeys was one of them. Willis is superb as he spins from madness to sanity and back again; he underplays all the way and is so much better than the wise-cracking everyman that he is better known for. Pitt is just as good but in a different way. Getting an Oscar nomination that he deserved, Pitt risks overdoing it but pushes his crazy performance as far as he can without being indulgent  I'm not saying he is perfect but I would could this as one of his best performances to date. Stowe is very much in the shadow of these two but she holds her own well. Morse, Seda, Meloni and Plummer are all good in minor roles but really the film belongs to the lead three  Willis in particular and Pitt in a great supporting role.Overall this is a great sci-fi; the story is great and is only helped by Gilliam's imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong, with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat, imaginative, engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam's films, it stands out as one of the best American sci-fi's of the past few decades.",Null,140,159,13 February 2005
Mississippi Burning," Maybe a bit too much of a film but still enjoyable
","When three young civil rights workers (two white and one black) going missing in the deep south of America, the FBI send two agents in to investigate.  Liberal young agent Ward and cynical local agent Anderson both approach the case in different ways, however both come up against a wall of silence and racism which seems to go all the way through the community, making their task near impossible.What do I mean when I say this is a bit too much of a film?  Well, the issues, history and settings here are all semi-factual and therefore should be quite an interesting film that attacks the heart.  Instead however, it is a thriller type film  and this becomes more and more evident as it goes on. The final 30 minutes set aside themes and discussion and go right for a thriller climax with enjoyable touches.  However it does lose sight of the issues, although, in fairness, it didn't have too good a grasp on them in the first place.The film never really sets out to do much more than paint the community as racist  and it does it rather too easily.  All the white racists are painted as inbred and monstrous (I'm not complaining!) while the black characters are all pretty much a silent group of extras.  I understand why the film did it this way, as to allow development of characters on both sides would have caused the thriller side of it to become baggier and less effective.  As it is, the broad strokes still work because I don't think many of us need to really be convinced that such racism is tolerable: it's easier just to cut out the debate in a thriller.The plot is pretty good and does paint the black situation pretty well.  It works best as a thriller though and early attempts to show the divide and so on are slowly moved to the back burner in favour of thriller touches.  Aside from a total lack of black characters and a tendency just to pigeon hole the white characters, the cast do a reasonable job, with plenty of well known faces.  Dafoe is good in the lead, despite being a little too wide-eyed for a FBI agent in charge of a major case.  Also, watching it now, it's funny at times because he sounds very like Agent Smith when he says `Mr Anderson'. Hackman overplays to good effect and he steals almost every scene he is in, although his romancing of McDormand is a little drawn out.  The support cast includes some reasonable turns from well-known faces including Dourif, Ermey and Tobolowsky.Overall this film has a reputation for being a quite powerful issue film. However it reality it is more a thriller which uses this setting of racial hatred as it's background and driver, rather than looking into it as a debate.  In fairness, it doesn't suffer for this and is actually an enjoyable film, which also serves as a reminder of a very common situation only a few short years ago.",Null,32,56,7 December 2003
The 13th Warrior," Some good grimy & gory action but mostly the film is uninvolving with no characters, a weak plot and poor dialogue throughout
","In 922 AD, Arab courier Ahmed is in the Nordic area of the world when a call goes out for thirteen warriors to come forward and help defend a town in the far North that has found itself under attack from a terrible form of evil. When it is announced that the gods have indicated that the 13th warrior of the group must not be a man from the north, Ahmed finds himself volunteered.Quickly he learns their language on the journey and he arrives to find himself in a battle against a species of bear-like demons who kill and eat their victims.I can only assume that the R rating really hurt this film as it came to the UK with no so much a fanfare as a whimper. The adverts were there more or less but the audience was not. I'm not sure if the reshooting helped or hindered this film as I have not seen or heard anything about what they redid or why they did it but I found this final product to be hardly spectacular but certainly an enjoyable enough swords & battles film. Based on a book by Michael Crichton, it was a surprise to me just how weak the script was (I have not read the book) although I could see enough plot to interest me if it had been written without so much clunky dialogue and maybe just given me even one character that I could get to know. Instead the scripts just seems to be trying to get to the next action scene and even makes the mistake of trying to inject a form of modern humour to the proceedings  failing in a quite unfunny manner.However what it does do pretty well is deliver battle sequences and solid bloody action even if they a little grimy and unshowy when you put them beside, say, Gladiator. However they are still enjoyable and the whole man/bear thing works a lot better than I expected it to; if only the script had been better then the action would have been more involving and therefore more exciting  as it was I found it to be enjoyable and bloody but I was barely engaged once. With such weak characters and dialogue to work with the cast are left just to try and look heroic and windswept  which is more or less all they manage to do. Banderas is quite a good presence but the rest of the cast are a mix of accents are really only serve to fill out the background without making much of an impact.Overall I can see why this film failed to capture an audience because it isn't any great shakes. The script is where the problems lie as it delivers mostly clunky dialogue without any feeling and manages to produce almost no characters that make an impression. The action is grimy and gory fun but without any involvement in the story I was left watching as opposed to being really into it. A watchable period action movie but no more than that and one that will fade from my memory pretty quickly I'm afraid.",Null,10,22,30 July 2004
The Impossible," Brutal at times despite its problems (SPOILERS)
","At some point there was going to be a big budget film about this tragedy, so to hear there was one was not a surprise nor something that upset me since it was always coming. The film is based on the true story of a Spanish family who somehow managed to survive the disaster, finding each other and making it home alive, although here the family are played as English but they are the focal point. We waste very little time at the start in setting the characters before they get hit by a wall of special effects in a sequence that is impacting, upsetting and incredibly tense.Visually there are some weaknesses in the effects but the camera-work covers a lot of them and the sound editing does the rest. In fact it is unfair to list the sound at the end of that sentence like an afterthought, because the sound in this sequence is amazing – it is everywhere and it is terrifying, even on a home stereo it still works. This is the real core of the film and it delivers because it stays with you the rest of the film as it should. From here the focus is more on the human tragedy, separated families, death, lack of information and so on. This aspects also works pretty well and is greatly helped by strong performances from Watts and McGregor but more importantly from the three boys, who are convincing throughout the film.It is not without problems though. The focus on one family and their (comparatively) happy ending is a necessary evil, but it is still an 'evil' in terms of the saying. The film spends a lot of time with holiday makers and westerners and not much with those living and working there; they are visible sure, but not much more that than. The decision to switch nationalities seems pointless and I'm not sure why they did it – they could easily have made the film in English with Spanish actors without it being less accessible and still appealing to the American market. This doesn't matter too much – but it does feel odd. Considering how well it impacts at some points, I also didn't understand why at other times it feels the need to really syrup on the emotion; the music is just what you expect and it comes up just when you know it will and it stirs upwards telling you what to feel; personally I didn't need it and it felt heavy handed too often.That said, it is still an impacting film and is worth a look. It does have problems but mostly it gets past them by virtue of the subject matter and the mostly strong delivery. This film was always going to be made and for sure it could have been a lot weaker than this.",Null,28,35,10 March 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Not wholly successful but a solid horror with laughs - fans of Spaced, Black Books etc will love it!
","Shaun is in his late twenties and works in a electrical store with teenagers.  He hangs out with his slobbish friend and spends every evening in the Winchester pub.  Fed up with this, his girlfriend dumps him, leaving him with the words of his other flatmate ringing in his ears - `sort your life out'.  His plans take an unexpected turn when he and Ed eventually notice that London's populace has mostly given into a virus that turns them into, well, the Z word.  Shaun and Ed devise a plan to keep safe and rescue Shaun's mother and ex.Although the makers were cursing themselves for the unfortunate timing of this film's release with the (much bigger budget) remake of Dawn of the Dead - however for me this served as a rather nice experience after the straight-scares of Dawn.  A point to note for all those moaners, is that this film went into production before the remake did.  Anyway, ignoring this issue it is important to note that the film is a very British affair and is aimed at a very particular sense of humour.  In essence, if you love Spaced then you'll enjoy this.  The film is NOT a spoof - it is a horror movie with laughs, not unlike Evil Dead in that regard.  The gags are good but not as fast as Spaced fans will be used to - instead they are put in with the horror rather than being forced over the top of it.The film has movie references, but not to the point where they become the gags themselves (Spaced's cutaways for example).  In place of that we have references to Deer Hunter and The Matrix that are funny but will not spoil things for you if you don't spot them.  I laughed throughout but it is important not to expect to be rolling in the aisles - the film is still a horror, not a Naked Gun style spoof.As a horror, the film is not really scary but does have a good gutful of gore to go around.  The zombies are slow, and this will not work for modern audiences, but it does hark back to the old zombie flicks and also allows the material to work.  I closed my eyes a few times as the film provided blood, and it does have the odd moment that is touching.  Of course the laughs are everything and, aside from a slow start and a more horror-focused ending, this is consistently funny.The one thing that it also does well is have a slight satirical edge to it. It is delivered rather heavily (early scenes of hooded youths lumbering around force the point home too heavily) but it is still true - having done my shopping in Asda just before seeing this film I can definitely contest that many of us lumber around in a semi-trance!  This is a nice touch - the Dawn remake lacked any of the comment that it's original made, so it is good to have some here.  Again however, non-Brits may not totally pick up on this as we seem to be one of the few countries that has this pub-orientated culture.The cast are great and will be full of faces recognisable from the TV series that this film will draw the majority of it's fans from.  Pegg is great, he is a slightly more advanced version of his Spaced character and he makes for a good leading character simply because he is so recognisable - this is not a Hollywood film with characters we don't know, but instead a bloke from a pub.  Despite the fact that I would hate Ed in real life, Frost is hilariously exaggerated.  He looks very different from Spaced but he does well with the material.  Ashfield is spunky and the only downside to her is that she would never be with Shaun in the first place.  Support is good from Moran, Davis and Nighy.  There are plenty of in-jokes for fans, including a great cameo from Stevenson, who also shows up with her own group of friends that mirror Shaun's friends in terms of looks and (pretty much) TV series background (eg Tim from the Office and Fran from Black Books).Overall this will not please everyone and I fear that some will not laugh as much as the adverts and hype suggested.  However it is a good horror comedy and easily the best British film of the year so far - fans of Spaced will notice the joke rate is scaled back but it is still very funny.  The humour of Spaced has reached the big screen and is doing good things for the British cinema industry.  The makers said they threw so much into the film (horror, comedy, romance, drama, gore) because they didn't think they would be allowed to make another film - I hope to god that is not the case.",Null,53,102,10 April 2004

Meanwhile Elizabeth's father arranges for her escape and she sets out to find Jack and Will.Having enjoyed the first film and applauded the Oscar nomination for Depp, I was looking forward to more of the same and went to see this film on the fist weekend. I was slightly on edge because of having of having to share a cinema with a group of chavs determined not to let anyone forget they were at the back, but settled into it. The opening of the film is rather heavy as it sets up the plot and it does rather lack the fun that the first film had  which is sadly how much of it turns out to be. It doesn't really help that the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense at times and that the film is too long but generally the main problem is that at times it forgets that first and foremost it is supposed to be entertaining. Others have wittily ripped of The Guardian newspaper by describing this as The Empire Strikes Jack, which is fine because it does have a good try at being dark and interesting, but it is at the expense of the fun.It does have moments throughout the film that are funny and entertaining but it puts too much emphasis on the plot (which isn't that great) and the darker tone. The latter is a problem then because the first film never took itself that seriously so it is a bit jarring as an audience member to be expected to suddenly buy into this film as the second part in a dark, sea-faring trilogy. The direction is still good and visually the film is very impressive; the sets, costumes and make-up are very convincing and the special effects look like every penny was spent (but they also merge well into the film and don't stand out for their own sake). Depp is as good as he was in the first film but here is sidelined by the many other characters and threads. It is a real shame and a big reason why it feels less fun than before  he has less to do and less to work with. Bloom is rather wooden and history may well remember him (assuming it does) as someone who lucked their way into two massive trilogies of the time before fading away. This may be a bit cruel but his performance isn't anything special and he is totally in Depp's shadow. Knightley is a bit better because she is feisty and fun. Nighy is a great addition  not only for his character but also for his performance, which is fun and slightly menacing; god only knows what the film would have been like without him because he does steal many of the scenes. Support from Skarsgård, Crook, McNally, Pryce, Davenport and others is mostly good but really the film could have done with a few characters and threads being scaled back to make for a brisker and pacier film. Harris was a surprise find and I was impressed she still managed to be sexual while under very ugly makeup.Overall then this is an OK summer film but those that loved the irreverent sense of fun of the original will probably feel a bit let down. It is still a solid film and the dark edge makes for a more rounded film  albeit not one that I actually wanted but still a good one. Visually it is amazing and I was never really bored at any point but I would have liked it have been a bit more fun than it was and also for the darker stuff to have had a bit more substance.",Null,7,11,4 August 2006
Rocky V," Not great  but a good story about father and son relations
","Immediately after his American/Russian bout, Rocky finds he has the shakes and discovers he has the beginnings of brain damage. He is challenged to a further fight by promoter George Washington Duke however he turns it down for retirement. A error by brother in law Paulie loses all Rocky's money to an accountant and the family move back to the streets of Philly. Rocky goes back to training at the old gym of his manager and finds a hot new hope in the shape of Tommy Gunn. However their relationship puts distance between Rocky and his son, and Duke shows a lot of interest in Gunn.This final (probably!) film in the Rocky series finds Rocky back where he started and looking after new talent. The story line is a mix of two main threads, the first is Washington trying to get Rocky back into the ring, while the other is the breakdown of the relationship between Rocky and his son. Both stories are component enough to entertain and actually this has more depth to it than some of the others (certainly this is much better than part 4).Stallone is dopey here  but he does well in a role he knows well. Again Shire and Young have little to do  although Young is good comedy value. Tommy Morrison is good as Gunn  although the change in his character is a little too sudden. Richard Gant is good value in a big send up of Don King.Overall this is not brilliant, but it has many levels  the father/son thing, the animosity between Rocky and Duke and a comment on the modern boxing world. It isn't fantastic but it's miles better than the woeful Rocky 4.",Null,7,12,14 May 2002
Argo," A rather straight telling, but the story is engaging throughout
","Argo interested me not only because it was rather breathlessly discussed by critics when it came to 'best film of 2012' time, but also because it was a true story that I knew nothing about – from detail to the ending it was all news to me. Watching it I still took it with a pinch of salt simply because I think it is wrong to approach any fictionalized version of a true story and assume that it is entirely gospel. The film walks a fine line between the dramatic and the absurd, almost to the point where if you left the cinema during one scene and then returned during another, you would be forgiven for thinking you'd come back into the wrong screen. It does this but yet it mostly pulls it off.The film opens with an American embassy in Iran being stormed and the majority of people taken hostage, except a small group who flee to the home of the Canadian Ambassador and are hidden. The story is then about the extradition of this small group, before the Iranians work out that they are missing and hunt them down; with options limited, the plan is to send an agent into Iran posing as someone scouting for locations for a movie – and then leave the country with the small group acting as his colleagues and peers. This involves doing more than saying it out loud as it has to pass muster with the Iranians – so the CIA works with a Hollywood writer and a producer to greenlight a film, sell it to the press and take their small production into Iran. In telling the story the film pretty much plays it straight and allows the scenario to be whatever it is – so when it is a press junket then it is amusingly absurd but while it is in an Iranian airport it is really tense and the stakes are apparent. This approach works pretty well because it lets the film have these extremes alongside one another without one undercutting the other. The downside is that it does occasionally mean that the telling feels quite 'ordinary' as it lacks an individual voice to the delivery – not boring by any means, but just surprisingly straight in the telling.This can be seen in the cast because mostly there are not really characters here, since the film focuses on events and doesn't leave a lot of time for the people (understandably). Affleck doesn't really work in the lead and I'm not sure why he cast him; he is OK but his presence is not all it needed to be in such a straight film. The various hostages in Iran don't really make an impression beyond them being just that, but there is color provided by solid turns from Goodman, Cranston, Arkin and a few others. As director Affleck does a good job to make the mix of content work so well, but the real credit to the production is how of the period it feels – there is nothing that really seems out of place, from office to street it feels like it was filmed back in the late 70s.Argo is an effective and engaging story that works partly because the telling is straight enough to let the events be however they are (absurd, tense, whatever). However this straight bat does also limit the film by making it feel a little ordinary in the delivery, without much flair or individual style to the telling, even if the attention to period is really well done.",Null,3,6,30 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Really good fun  doesn't take itself too seriously and is played to perfection by a wonderful Depp
","Sailing with her father as a girl, Elizabeth Swann, is on board when the military ship comes across a wreck from which they rescue only a young boy, Will Turner.  Elizabeth hides the boy's medallion in order to hide the fact that he is a pirate, she also thinks she sees the mysterious ship The Black Pearl.  Years later Elizabeth is being wooed by officers while Will is a blacksmith in her father's service.  When her  medallion calls out to another force, it brings the crew of the Pearl to the bay in search of the gold.  Elizabeth is kidnapped and Will resolves to go after her.  He turns to the only man he knows who knows the black pearl  incarcerated pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.  However how can you trust a pirate's word?I'll be honest and say that I didn't want to see this film  I had been totally turned off by the trailer.  The one attempt at humour in the trailer is that awful `try wearing a corset' line, it didn't get a laugh in the film or on the trailer.  However I did go and see it and, after Hulk and Matrix, I was very glad I did.  The plot is pretty enjoyable allowing for lots of fights but also enough twists and turns to hold the interest.  It doesn't all make total sense but, like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything.Unlike those other blockbusters I mentioned, POTC doesn't take itself too seriously.  It doesn't make fun of itself either, but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek the whole time.  This is seen in the vein of gentle humour that runs through it in the dialogue, action and characters  the film is basically having fun so it is easy for the audience to get with it too.As every other reviewer on earth has said, the biggest strength of the film is Depp's Captain Jack.  Playing him like a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft, Depp wrings so much humour out of every line, every scene and every little thing he does (`but why is the rum on fire?' being my favourite line).  It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun.  The only downside of his character (who makes his appearance on a ship revealed to be a tiny, sinking boat) is that the film sags a little when he is off screen for longer than 5 minutes.Bloom and Knightly carry the film's more serious core and thus have a less glorious job.  Both do well however and are good if not quite stars  certainly I was surprised to see Knightly with such a big role in a big film.  Rush enjoys himself as Barbossa and the crew also have fun.  The effects are used just as they should always be used  to compliment the film rather than be the raison d'etre!  The effects are good without replacing plot or characters  they are well blended into the flow so never bring the film to a halt by their use (although wine flowing through and out of Barbossa is pretty impressive).Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal.  Sure it is not a classic film or a perfect one, but it does exactly what a summer film should be  entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously and moves a long at a fair pace without ever lapsing into impatient editing or flashy visuals.  Having said that, if Depp was not onboard the film would be much the lesser.  His exaggerated performance enhances the tongue in cheek feel to the film and makes it a much funnier, livelier and all round fun experience.",Null,11,23,1 September 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," Is a perfectly fine blockbuster with lots of bang for your buck, but should have been more than it is (SPOILERS)
","It has been a few years since the first film in this reboot and I found myself coming to this sequel having quite forgotten the events of that film but generally remembering that I quite enjoyed it. Although I didn't know it going into the film, Into the Darkness is a 'new timeline' version of Wrath of Khan, which is probably my favorite of the original films. The plot sees Kirk going after a former Starfleet member when he launches a series of terrorist attacks on them; however in the process of their pursuit they discover that things are not as simple as they had been told by Admiral Marcus.This is the summertime so this means that the cinemas are essentially going to be full of noise, explosions and action because this is the season for it. With Star Trek this is also the case and from the very opening scene we have narrow escapes from massive CGI death and lots of lots of things moving around the screen very quickly. On this front I found the film to be mostly enjoyable with plenty going on, some laughs and generally plenty of color and zing. The plot in theory offers more than this though since the idea of terrorist attacks by someone that the Starfleet tried to use to help them defeat their enemies and the theme of not becoming as bad as those we pursue is very much informed by post-9/11 politics. This had the potential to be darkly interesting but it is an add find in a family blockbuster and to be honest it doesn't totally work because it isn't really explored so much as it is just used as a frame for the action. As a frame it is decent enough and I liked the way it had updated the original plot, but the lack of development of the idea was a problem and it did also produce some odd moments.In particular there is a scene right at the end where Khan flies a starship directly into San Francisco; it is delivered in such a way that one cannot help think of the 9/11 attacks and those feelings and images are raised but yet the attack is only used as spectacle in a CGI frenzy and I felt that it was a poor decision to invoke this as much as it did. That said, the spectacle is the thing here and the film does keep this coming with near-constant action which is only really broken up by quips, romance or manly staring. The references to the original film are quite nice but have the downside of making you compare them – and generally, although this film is much more technologically impressive, I found that in all other aspects the original film stood up as better.The cast also mostly fall short of the performances in the original Khan. Pine is OK but is best when he is allowed to twinkle his eyes, deliver a smart line then jump an impossible distant to punch someone; when he has to be emotionally wounded or conflicted he really doesn't convince. Much was made of his faceoff with Cumberbatch but the sparks never really fly here because the two men are not given space to have that tension for very long, Cumberbatch is a good bit of casting and would have been better with more speeches or dialogue but is not given enough to do because the next action scene is always pushing the current scene to be over so it can start. As a result I have to say I preferred the original Kirk and Khan and enjoyed their conflict more. Quinto is OK as Spock although it still just feels like an impression and not a character; he gets the 'KHAN' line but it is weakly delivered and doesn't compare to the original delivery by Kirk (or for that matter the delivery by George Constanza). Urban is cool and quite amusing while Saldana mostly hangs around in the background and Eve is used both as a plot device and also as an excuse to have someone in underwear. Generally the performances do what is required by the film and work as much, however at the end I was surprised by how infrequently I had heard some of the characters actually speak.Although I have been a bit negative here, Star Trek does work as a fun summer blockbuster with plenty of noise and action. My reservations about the way the ideas behind the plot are not really used stayed with me the whole film and the constant references to the original film caused me to constantly compare the two and find this one to be the weaker. However in terms of spectacle and bangs for buck, this is perfectly fine and professionally done, just a shame that it clearly could have been more than this.",Null,3,7,20 May 2013
Stripes," Not very funny but Murray is good
","On the same day as he quits his job as a taxi driver, John Winger's girlfriend dumps him for someone who has drive and a willingness to grow. Looking at their directionless lives, both John and friend Russell decide to enlist in the army to become men.  Despite hating the regime, both men do surprisingly well - a fact which leads them to a project in Italy.The plot here is pretty basic and has been done many times before and since - wise ass joins the army and mocks it before eventually making good in his own way.  The film is split into two; the boot camp being the first and the mission in Italy being the second.  The first part treads familiar ground reasonably well without ever being very funny.  The second part is absurd and is far too silly to really be funny.  Plot didn't so much matter to me as long as I was laughing quite a lot but sadly I wasn't and the scripted gags and scenarios just felt tired, daft or both.What saved the film from being bad was a great lead from Murray.  He shows himself to a great comic touch and this film was part of his breakthrough to films.  He doesn't have that many great lines but his delivery and his wise-ass delivery really does the job.  Ramis looks less assured and doesn't seem to be taking it very serious (but not in a good way).  He seems unsure of himself in front of the camera and gives a poor performance.  Oates is good and both Candy and Reinhold are pretty funny.  Young has a small role and isn't annoying - so that's good then!Overall this is a silly comedy that might win you over if you are really in the mood and happy to accept less.  However I found it to be rather too daft to be funny and didn't laugh at great deal.  If you aren't sold on the silly comedy during the boot camp then the second half with a mobile home acting as an urban assault vehicle will just leave you cold.  Murray is as good as he usually is but the film just ain't that good.",Null,2,5,11 January 2004
12 Angry Men," The material is slightly forced for dramatic purposes but the delivery is perfect across the board
","A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one 'not guilty' in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.I'm not a massive fan of the 'Movie You Must See' podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this 'mates in a pub' approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out 'films you should see' is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a 'classic' but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled 'racist', 'old', 'naïve', 'angry' and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has 'top-billing' but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the 'MYMS' group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",Null,10,15,27 April 2008
Beauty and the Beast," Classy piece of animation
","When an arrogant Prince turns away an old woman looking for shelter with only a rose for a gift, she warns him not to just take the surface appearance as being the all of a person; however he rejects her a second time  only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful enchantress. She casts a spell on him, turning him into a beast with the only hope of return being to fall in love with a woman and have her fall in love with him before the rose wilts and dies. Resembling a carpet stuffed with walnuts, the prince figures he has no chance and withdraws into his castle. When an elderly man wanders into the castle, the Beast holds him prisoner and only lets him go when his daughter, Belle, offers to replace him in the Beast's castle. With time running out, the Beast's staff hope that Belle will be the one to break the curse but the Beast cannot remember how.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However with this film I was quite taken by how classy the whole affair was, with great effort being shown in every area from the animation, to the songs through to the emotionally involving story whose telling is touched with a nice sense of wonder throughout. The story doesn't really hit many bum notes (I thought Gaston's sidekick was a bit too obvious and half cooked) and it is interesting and enjoyable for the vast majority of the time. The story and comedy is aimed at both adults and children  but the stuff for kids is not basic pratfalls, nor is the adult material just a load of references or suggestive jokes. Instead the two are quite well blended with good physical comedy and plenty of wit. Again, it is the sense of spectacle and wonder that came through that I really appreciated.The animation feels more impressive for the reliance on mostly traditional animation rather than computer effects  in fact the computer effects look a bit dated now, even if they do still produce the goods in some key scenes. Mainly it is the feeling that every frame has had a lot of effort and love put into it that makes the whole affair feel classy. The songs are also great and feature quite a few memorable songs that stick in the mind; meanwhile the choreography of these scenes is generally very imaginative (Be Our Guest was my favourite). The cast don't feature many big stars and perhaps this is good because the real people don't distract from their characters. That said, I thought that Benson, O'Hara, White and a few others were quite unremarkable even if they were good enough for the film. Orbach, Stiers, Lansbury and others provided comic work in the support characters and everything worked well.Overall this is a really classy animated film that shows the effort and care put into it in many different regards. It does suffer a bit from cuteness and sentimentality but I didn't think this was a massive problem or something that was not to be expected from Disney and generally I really enjoyed the film and see it as one of the films that define Disney for people of my generation.",Null,52,68,27 March 2005
The English Patient," Epic story that mixes lust with a mystery story  worthy stuff but a touch too slow
","Tuscany WW2.  Traumatised by the loss of anyone she cared for or loved, Canadian nurse Hana stays behind her unit with a dying patient, Count Laszlo de Almásy.  de Almásy is burnt all over and has lost his memory.  When a vengeful, mysterious thief arrives at their abandoned monastery with a past that seems to include de Almásy , and as Hana reads from his book, memories return regarding his past.  He relives his story of lust and love and the destructive force that forbidden passion unleashed upon his life.This is quite a modern epic.  It has the running time of an epic, it has the gorgeous cinematography of an epic, it has the acting of an epic and it has a story of love (lust) against the backdrop of major events in history. Even though it changes or leaves out a significant amount of the original novel it still manages to be a great mix of passionate desire and mystery. The mystery of the story is represented by the thief Caravaggio who casts light on what he knows of de Almásy's past (as he sees it) while the love story is unfolded as it develops in a passionate affair between him and Katherine, a colleagues' wife.  The story is compelling enough to carry the long running time, at times the pace seems a little slow and when I saw it in my local multiplex there were some moments where large portions of the audience seemed to be shifting in their seats.The love' of the story was interesting as it seems to be contrasted with Hana's relationship with Kip the bomb disposal expert.  While de Almásy's relationship with Katherine starts as lust and desire before growing into what seems to be love (or could be grief at the result of their affair), Hana's is portrayed as purer and more careful as she fears those she loves will die.  This difference helped me see that the film did want to show the destructive power of lust and affairs, however the fact that the central relationship was based more on lust than love took away from the emotional core of the story.The acting is almost impeccable.  Fiennes is excellent even when he is lost behind an unrecognisable mask of burnt flesh.  Thomas is actually very good, I find she tends to be very wooden in some things but this type of very English character brings the best out of her.  Binoche is excellent as Hana and carries the heart of the film.  Dafoe is truly excellent - his element of the story is the mystery and he does it well.  He is a great actor and deserves to be in things this good.  The support cast include plenty of good actors including Colin Firth, Jurgen Prochnow and Naveem Andrews.The film is beautifully shot - even though it's all a bit too picturesque to be real!  However the director can handle himself well with many different scenes - a tense bomb diffusal, a passionate love scene, a dangerous sand storm etc.  Overall the slow pace may frustrate some younger audiences but this is a really good film that draws it's values from classy sources.",Null,99,143,26 February 2002
Hostel," Deeply unpleasant on one level; thrilling on another  it works for what it sets out to do but is a very basic and cynical affair that will put many off
","Hostel was one of those films described as 'torture porn' and, with my low tolerance for gore, I decided to give it a miss at the cinemas and dismiss it if anyone brought it up. However as it came on TV a month or so ago I decided that maybe I was being unfair by not giving it a try. It did sit on my HDD for a month though as somehow I never was in the mood until I forced myself to watch it. It does what you expect it to do and there should be no surprise that it is very gory throughout. What surprised me was how gripped I was by it as I squirmed in my seat and had the emotional 'flight' response while sitting there. In that sense the film works because for all but the most hardened viewer it will have you feeling ill and get your heart beating. However while it did achieve this, it did it by simply going direct for being as sadistic and graphic as it possibly could.In a way there is a 'build-up' to the main gory bits but this is less of a decision so much as a necessary evil of having any sort of story. The first thirty minute or so are essentially the guys getting honey-trapped into this Eastern-European world of heartless torture and then from there we have gore for varying reasons (and here the makers give us nudity to prevent the male target audience getting bored). You never really care about the characters or the story because the tension is not about 'what is happening next' as it is about the act you are watching. It is a cynical horror movie in this way as it has a very simple atmosphere and a very simple target or gore. While you are watching it the sheer cruel horror of it might stop you thinking but ultimately it is a soulless affair that reminds me of the viral '2 girls 1 cup' video. You see both are the type of thing you want to watch but also don't want to see, both also are entirely about seeing horrible things from the remote safety of your home and of course both generally get a 'hands over eyes, open-mouth but yet unable to look away' response from viewers. This is all Hostel is going for and this is why I have real reservations recommending it because as a 'film' it is pretty poor.Those that love gore will love it though because in this area it excels. The effects are horrifically realistic and are delivered in clear, cruel shots. The actors do a great job of convincing in their pain, horror and fear and this is part of the gore voyeur aspect of the film. As characters though they are poor and can do nothing with the script other than be young and geeky/sexy/beefy/stoned* (delete as appropriate). Hoffman's portrayal of power is the only exception because, while a bit whacked out, he perfectly captures the sheer indifference to live that real evil has. Roth's direction doesn't show much in the way of subtlety but he knows what his audience want and how to give it to them. The lack of anything beyond this in his delivery or script can be easily seen in the way that the film doesn't even try to do something with the fact that we are getting entertainment from watching people torture/kill others for their entertainment. Normally in this sort of thing there would at least be some reference to this conflict but here Roth is part of his audience and sees nothing wrong at all with what he is doing  which is a problem for me, not that he needs to be 'ashamed' but just that a film should not just be a load of filmed gore with no heart or reason to care.Hostel is a gory horror movie that is entirely about being repulsed and thrilled by the graphic and sadistic acts portrayed with excellent special effects. Those looking for this will be pleased with it but the majority will be turned off. For some it will simply be too gory to watch and they will get no pleasure from witnessing hell on earth  I totally understand where they are coming from. However the majority of viewers will not be those that struggle with gore but just object to the cynical way that it is put on the screen without any real attempt at using it as part of the film or story  no, here the gore is the all and there is nothing else to watch it for. This factor alone makes me stronger in my decision to ignore this genre for what it is because being good at what you do doesn't mean that it is right for you to do it in the first place.",Null,47,66,18 November 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Impresses with CGI but not where it counts
","Sent away from the city to escape the bombing raids of the war, siblings Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find themselves in the large home of Professor Kirke. Although bored out of their tiny minds, the older children are not so bored that they escape Lucy flight of fancy about a magical world inside Kirke's wardrobe. They don't, that is, until they stumble into themselves. Initially enjoying the frozen world of talking creatures, things change when the family are betrayed from within and find themselves key players in a war between the forces of good and evil for the very world of Narnia.Ironically enough it was perhaps a certain amount of fatigue from the Lord of the Rings films that made me decide not to bother with this new film series, even though I had read all the books as a child. I watched it recently on television though and must admit that, in the overall sweep, it does work. Technically it is impressive of course, with the effects being realistic and convincing throughout (well  as convincing as Ray Winstone as a beaver can be at any rate). The battle sequences and the creation of Narnia is all equally as convincing but yet it was not the design and visual delivery where I had a problem at all.No. Where I felt the film lacked was in the areas of heart and characters. The material is fine and I personally was not put off by the obvious themes from Christianity  although I can understand why some others might. If anything I was surprised by how dark it was with many characters being 'killed' across the whole running time of the film. Problem is that it is only really 'dark' in these very specific actions  not even 'moments' but just in exact acts. This lack of depth sees the film be superficially enjoyable but offer nothing more beyond. Perhaps it is the comparatively short running time that does it but generally the film seems to be constantly moving forward but without ever taking time to sink its roots. For me this mean that I spent a lot of the film watching a spectacle rather than being engaging by a great story.The script is the clear weakness as it does focus on events rather than characters. In this regard perhaps it is telling that director Adamson has his background in visual effects and animated features rather 'films'. The casting process has not produced much to work with either, although in fairness the children do not have much to work with even if they had the range (which personally I do not think they did). Keynes, Moseley, Henley and Popplewell are all very English children and in this regard they suit the narrative and the style, however they do not have the range or material to deliver more than 'English children'. It is a shame because the film does feature a very strong performance from Swinton as the White Witch; she is a real presence and the film is never better than when she is on the screen. Broadbent, is OK; McAvoy is OK; Cosmo is OK; Winstone is fun; French is OK; Everett is a random but enjoyable touch but the best piece of casting is Madsen as the main wolf, his voice being very distinctive and mean.Overall then this is a technically impressive film that has plenty for the eye if you are looking for a spectacle. However if, like me, you are looking for something with depth, character and heart then this sadly is not the film for you. Having said that, I was not that impressed by the first LoTR film so maybe this series will find its depth with time and I will probably give it a few more chances to impress me with more than CGI.",Null,2,2,11 April 2008
Happy Gilmore," Average comedy with energy and a few genuine laughs (but mostly goofball ones)
","Frustrated ice hockey player Happy Gilmore will never make it into the sport despite his intense hitting strength and aggressive game.  When he is seen by ex-golf pro Chubbs Peterson, on a driving range, Happy is offered the chance to enter a golf contest.  When his Grandma's house is repossessed, Happy enters in order to make money quickly.  However soon it becomes about more than money as pro Shooter McGavin tries to show him up.Those watching an Adam Sandler comedy usually are prepared for the type of humour that they are about to experience.  I know I didn't sit down expecting clever, witty word play or an intricate, playful script that toys with my emotions. No, I knew that I was ready for the man-child's clowning and lots of dumb, silly jokes.  So I actually quite enjoyed my time spent watching this film as I knew what I was getting into.  The plot is simply dumb but of course that's the point!  The fun is supposed to be in watching Happy getting where he's going rather than wondering if he'll come out on top or not.The jokes are pretty run of the mill for Sandler.  They all have a certain quality that will raise a vague smile often enough to enjoy, but doesn't really ever make you laugh out loud more than a handful of times.  Of course for lots of times, Sandler's overacting (or overreacting!) makes things funnier and he does an OK job with the material.  The actual role is the same one he always plays and is not hard for him.  Guest is better with witty support but Sandler pretty much runs the film without ruining it.While it didn't totally grab my full attention and have me rolling, it was amusing and light enough not to have to concentrate on  which is what I was looking for on a cold Saturday afternoon.  Not really worth checking out if you can't stand Sandler, but neutrals on the subject (such as me) will find it passable enough comedy. Die hard fans will, of course, love it to death but fear not, for a vengeful God awaits them!",Null,7,12,19 October 2003
Madagascar," Very funny at points but it lacks heart and the main characters pale beside the support
","Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria all live in the New York zoo, where they are good draws and get regular meals. However Marty dreams of the wild and freedom and, when a crack group of penquins seem to offer him a way out, he takes it. His friends find he is missing and set out to convince him to return, catching him at Grand Central Station, only to get caught by the police. With the people convinced that the animals cannot return to the zoo, the four are shipped out to the wild but a shipping accident sees them washed up in a wilderness that their city live has not prepared them for.Looking a lot more cartoony than similar film, I decided to give Madagascar a miss until I saw the short film from the penguins and decided to give it a try. The plot is a worthy try to repeat the fun and heart of films such as Toy Story but, although it delivers the former, the latter is lacking. It tries to have some sort of moral by the end but it doesn't really come off and it would have been better not to try at all. However this is a minor problem because mostly it is very funny, producing some big laughs as well as being consistently funny. The biggest laughs come from the side characters such as the penguins, the lemurs and the two monkeys which is great but it means that the main characters are almost begrudgingly returned to the screen at times while the actual plot is where the sags come in.This is a bit of a problem and again robs the material of its heart but I didn't really care that much because I was laughing consistently across the whole film. The star cast work well. Stiller was actually pretty good while both Rock and Schwimmer were really well-suited to their characters and the humour. Smith was more 'there' than she was doing anything, but she was alright if unimpressive. However all four of them are put in the shade by the support cast  a fact not helped that the support have the best material to work with. Cohen naturally steals the show with an outrageously funny performance that had me in stitches and he was well supported by an unusually restrained Cedric the Entertainer. The penguins also combined to produce a wonderful subplot to the film and their planning and scheming was hilarious; likewise, although in a smaller role, the posh monkey was very funny.Overall this is a consistently funny film that survives despite the fact that the narrative and the four main characters are actually not its strengths while those looking for the heart of Toy Story will be disappointed. However it has more than enough laughs to be worthwhile and the supporting cast and characters are really where the film is at.",Null,5,6,11 December 2005
Bloody Sunday," The majority is good - conveying the chaos and confusion of the day, but the conclusion is pure fiction that degrades the film to a clumsy exercise in finger pointing.
","On 30th January 1972 Londonderry Ivan Cooper is one of the group of volunteers that put together a march against internment and campaigning for civil rights.  The march starts peacefully but breakaway youths start rioting against the military presence, throwing abuse and stones.  The march continues but, under the impression that the army have been fired on, the army open fire on the marchers.  At first they fire over the marchers heads, however the confusion and chaos builds and innocent civilians begin to fall. At the end of the day, 27 civilians are shot, 13 of them are killed, of all ages.  This is a dramatisation of the events that contains scenes and dialogue that are fictional.  The film is however based on documented evidence.Films about Northern Ireland tend to reveal what side of the fence people are on.  I'm from Northern Ireland (until a few years ago) and am a Protestant.  However I'm in two minds about this film.  The first hour or so is really good, the story unfolds in a series of scenes that fade in and out - this technique makes it feel a little episodic but happily doesn't go on for the whole film.  The main strength of the film is that it uses handheld cameras to create a great sense of chaos, confusion and disorientation. This helps show the events in a relatively balanced light.  It's not clear if shots are fired at the army or not - it's so noisy that some of the bangs could have been shot.  What is clear that the military were as confused as the marchers - however the film does allow the fact that many police and soldiers had been murdered in the run up to the march and at least it shows the IRA having an armed presence and returning fire.It also bravely shows civilians being shot - this is hard to accept but lets be honest (13 dead) this happened.  It starts to show it's bias towards the end of the march when soldiers are shown shooting marchers who are wounded on the ground etc, however for the most the chaos is palatable and the soldiers are shown as on-edge and a little too ready to react (however they were in a war zone - Free Derry was not the best place for anyone not supporting the IRA to be).The final 30 minutes of the film deals with the aftermath of the events. This is where it nails it's colours to the wall.  It shows the soldiers lying to the investigating bodies and making up things that didn't happen - these scenes are clearly the dramatised ones.  However if the film claims to be based on evidence then why does it totally ignore the testimony of the soldiers who claimed they opened fire on armed men?  Yes they hit civilians but the starting point may have been the IRA opening fire.  The way the film shows that the army are lying goes against the claim that it is based on documented evidence - if it were truly based on evidence then it would mix the testimony of marchers and soldiers.  I'm sure that the soldiers are not blame free but this is a clumsy finger pointing exercise.The problem is this - it wants to have it's cake and eat it.  It wants to be taken as a documentary style film (the director is a former World in Action producer) but it also wants to include fictional scenes.  It can't have it both ways - this allows the film maker to do anything he wants in the fictional scenes and back it up with the claim of documented evidence.  It's a shame because the chaos and confusion of the march is so well handled and manages to spread blame evenly without finger pointing.  However it blows it's credibility at the end by revealing a horrible bias.The cast are all quite good but the standout is James Nesbit in one of the best roles I've seen him in (I'm not just saying that because he's a fellow Coleraine lad!).  He starts out as a happy go lucky politician type but slows becomes a white-faced witness to the deaths on the day.  His horror looks so real and echoes the viewers emotions.  He helps us see that what happened was terrible, regardless of the circumstances (even if the civilians were caught in cross fire, it's still terrible) and that the horror on the day extends beyond religious boundaries.If you compare this with Sunday that deals with the same subject, this comes across much better and with much less finger pointing, but it's still as guilty of using fictional scenes to incriminate one side.  It's a shame that the film takes the evidence of marchers as gospel but ignores the claims of soldiers that they were under fire themselves.  Where did the IRA go on that day?  Free Derry was an IRA stronghold that was guarded by patrolled by armed men - it was a RUC and army no-go area.  The claim that they had an armed presence there on the day seems perfectly reasonable to me.  In fact the idea that they had no part in the day at all (apart from a few men chased off by civilians) seems ludicrous.Overall this is quite good - the march is well handled and feels chaotic and confused, leading to the deaths.  However the final half hour  is pure fiction and is an exercise is clumsy finger pointing.  With the enquiry still going on, why don't we wait just wait to see what the outcome of that is?  Why do filmmakers feel they have carte-blanche to rewrite history, using or discarding evidence as they see fit.  Worth watching for the harrowing depiction of events spinning out of control but please look into the evidence yourself - don't just assume that you can tell what is made up and which bits aren't.  6 out of 10 (but only for the excellent hand-held camera coverage of the march).",Null,21,42,22 February 2002
Us," Effective horror although the underlying subtext requires too much reaching and doesn't come off as smart as it could have been
","A lot of hype leading up to this film, the second film from Jordan Peele, and with a lot of expectation on it. I admit I too was looking forward to it after seeing the very strong trailer for it. Mostly the film met my expectations. It was not as relentless or as frightening as the trailer had suggested it may be, but it did still have its share of tense, horrific, and intense moments. The pace and style of the delivery makes it work well, and it builds pretty nicely in terms of scale. It is very much a genre film, but that in itself is not a measure of anything, because you can have good genre films and bad ones, and this is a good one.While it is a horror, it also manages to have a good streak of dark humor running through it. The political element I think was less successful; some have been full of praise for how smart and daring it is, while others react negatively to what they perceive as a 'woke' film pushing an agenda. Personally I found interesting ideas in here but they don't hang together, unfold as the film progresses, or really give you something 100% concrete to then think back over. The ideas are not nothing though, and it is still interesting to read thoughts and theories about certain points, because they are 'interesting' but in the context of watching the film I didn't feel they were there in a meaningful way, and afterwards it did feel like I was reaching a bit to find them.The direction and performances make a big difference in this. All of the leads are good in their own ways, mostly playing it strong in their two different characters. As everyone else has said, Lupita Nyong'o is by far the strongest in not only her two characters, but the range in which she plays the main one. I wonder if the various industry awards can look beyond the genre and see the performance(s) because it is certainly more worthy of awarding than some which are given to performances of 'worthy' characters. Whether she does or doesn't though, if there are other levels in this film, it is her that finds them more than any of the various political allegories in there.So not as smart or as brilliant as the hype would have you believe, but it is still a well-crafted, interesting, and engaging horror that works mostly as a genre film, but has plenty in the style, direction, and performances to make it a quality one.",Null,1,2,22 September 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Must see for fans  but funny and clever enough for a wider audience
","In the quiet little town of South Park Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny bride a tramp to sneak them into an R screening of the new Terrance & Phillip movie. They emerge foul mouthed and with attitude as a result of the movie and, while repeating a stunt in the film, Kenny is killed and sent to Hell. Kyle's mother leads a movement against the Canadian comedians that results in their arrest and sentencing to death.  Meanwhile in Hell, Satan and his lover Saddam Hussain prepare for the killing of Terrance & Phillip  the sign of the coming of the new time where Satan will rise again to rule the earth.  Can Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny save the comedians, stop the censorship movement that blames society for bad behaviour and prevent Satan and Saddam from destroying the world?I suspect those that hate this movie are generally those who hate the TV show, where those who liked it may not be those who watch the show.  I'm a fan of the show but I not such a fan that I blind to the lack of consistency at times in the show  some episodes are dumb and lack wit, trading on swear words and forced jokes.  However I fell in love with this movie from my first time seeing it.  The film is funny in the same sort of silly juvenile way that the series is.  It has the same strange sense of humour  witness Conan O'Brien having a `Judas' moment and throwing himself to his death!However on top on this it is imaginative.  How many other crude films would do it as a musical.  I'm not saying that this makes it more worthy than gross out comedies like American Pie etc, but it is cleverer.  The musical element adds to the film and helps it's stretched running time.  The songs are all catchy and are better than some of Lloyd-Webber's stuff!  They are choreographed well and just feel funnier due to the situation and the lyrics!  For example Satan's song `Up there' is excellent but hilarious because of who's singing it and the sentiments he's expressing!The irony of the film is not lost.  The accusations levelled at the South Park Movie are those that the mothers in the film level at Terrance & Phillip.  The story actually answers it's own critics while telling the story!  It's not perfect and it does go a bit over the top and maybe begins to think that it is cleverer than it actually is.The voice work is as excellent as always and Parker and Stone carry this the whole way home.  Guest stars add some interest but really all I need is Cartman et al and I'm set!Overall I am a South park fan and I really enjoyed this.  Not just because of the elements of the show that are reproduced here but also how clever it feels (even if it isn't always as smart as it wants to be).  This isn't a cheap TV spin off into a movie this is a film that is imaginative and funny. Haters of the show will hate this but this may win you over if you thought the TV show was juvenile and a waste of time.",Null,87,97,2 November 2002
Elizabeth," Period drama for those who don't like period dramas
","A biopic of the Virgin Queen Elizabeth's rise to power in England showing the corruption in her court with assassinations, unsuitable suitors, political marriages and treachery.This is very much a historical costume drama for those that dislike the dry, lifeless drama of other period dramas such as Merchant & Ivory etc.  This is a wonderfully vibrant piece, full of gaudy colours, comical and treacherous performances.  Director Kapur brings the air of corruption and betrayal to life in a story that is rich in detail and story.  The story is full of action and wonderful characters and holds the interest from beginning to end.  Kapur gives plenty of modern touches to the drama from comical touches of Elizabeth rehearsing her speech in very quickly edited sequences to filming her through a red-veil shortly after a murder that was authorised by her.  It is good to watch a period drama that is so very vibrant and colourful.Cate Blanchett is great as Elisabeth but the supporting cast are roundly fantastic - Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston the list of quality actors goes on goes on.  This is also completed by UK TV actors such as Cathy Burke and Angus Deayton.  Ex-Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona also shows that he made a good career choice by putting in a good performance in a small role as a member of the French court.Overall a great film that brings the period to life - warts and all.",Null,13,23,4 January 2002
The Girl Next Door," Poor plot, poor material, no laughs, forced titillation for boys and a crude air produce a film that will have almost no appeal outside of the male teen market
","Matthew Kidman is a geek; school president, hangs out with other nerds and generally doesn't have any luck with the popular guys or the girls. He can't believe his luck when a gorgeous girl moves in next door and seems happy to hang out with him. His illusions are shattered when he learns that she is a porn star and, unsure of how to act, he ruins things between them. But both seem reluctant to truly break it off but can they work through their differences.Even though I like to think that I have good taste in films, I did see the trailer and thought 'hmmm, could be sexy and funny' and decided to give it a go on DVD. However if I'd known that it would really be neither then perhaps I wouldn't have bothered. The plot is pretty simplistic and is really the ultimate teenage boy fantasy, but it is this at the expense of the issues that could have been put into the film. Porn is a complex and nasty business and those involved in it can easily have difficult relationship and lives, however this film doesn't do anything with this aspect of the plot (apart from Matty wanting Danielle out of the business). The lowest point was a throwaway line that one of the porn stars had lost her virginity at age 10. Sorry, but the implication that a woman got into the sex industry of the back of sexual abuse as a child (and all that brings mentally and emotionally) is not a joking matter and I was stunned that nobody had the good taste to remove this line. Of course this is a comedy so I wouldn't expect it to do this because it would take away from the laughs but, with this film, the writers have already taken the laughs away and replaced with crude material and ineffective titillation.For teenage boys then I can imagine this mix will work but for me it just didn't tickle me at all. There were no real jokes here and, instead, there are just jocular references to porn mixed with scenes of 'hot girls', semi-nudity and the inevitable (and increasingly boring) girl/girl kissing. I had hoped that it would have a fun sexy air to it but it really didn't, instead it was ground in crudity and the obvious sexuality of porn. Of course some of it was still quite sexy but generally it was for teenagers more than anything else. Sadly this also took priority over the material and as a result the actual romance is flat and unconvincing  we are meant to buy Danielle changing her life for Matt but their relationship is so thin as to not exist  and playful flirting at the start just doesn't didn't do it for me.Like many others, part for my motivation for seeing this film was 24's Elisha Cuthbert, but I felt a bit bad for her as I thought she was basically exploited. With very little in the way of material to work with she is reduced to spending most of the first half of the film just being, well, sexy! At times she seems to be trying to bring out emotions and conflicts in her character and I thought 'she's got something here' but she was let down by a script that was more interested in where the next half-naked girl was coming from as opposed to the inner workings of the characters. Hirsch is likable but just to wishy washy for my liking, but again the plot gives him little to work with. The two characters that the film does have fun with are Kelly and Eli and the two actors both have fun as a result. Olyphant is fun but it is Marquette that steals all his scenes  admittedly he has little competition but still. He is lively and funny and the extras on the DVD's are best when he is in character at the Adult Film conference. Dano is OK but is an easy geek, while the rest of the cast just plays jocks etc. Remar makes a brief appearance surrounded by lovely ladies and there are plenty of them  something that will keep the teenage boys happy  but the rest of us will probably wonder why we didn't just watch porn!Overall this is a pretty poor film but it has just about enough energy to be watchable in you are in a very undemanding mood. There are no actual laughs to be had and the rest of the film just tries to keep providing titillation every few minutes to cover the total lack of material. The characters are flat, the relationships pathetically drawn and I had stopped caring about the story long before the end. I wouldn't watch it again and I would not recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 or female.",Null,7,16,23 August 2004
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Distracting and sporadically amusing but far too patchy and obvious to do the job
","Having survived the advancing ice in the first film, Manny, Sid and Diego face a new problem when a conman's warnings about an apocalyptic flood turn out to be true, as the ice walls around their valley are barely holding back a mass of water. Leading the animals to the other end of the valley in search of safety, Manny frets about being the last of his species, Sid worries about not being respected while Diego worries about his secret fear of water. On their way they meet Ellie  a large mammoth that offers Manny hope for the future  if only she didn't think that she was a possum like her 'brothers' Crash and Eddie.Although I thought Ice Age was an OK film I must admit that I assumed any sequel would be one of those 'no star voices' affairs that go straight to video sale and wondered why they bothered to follow up such an unremarkable film. I still went to see it though but sadly I only found my fears confirmed by a film that is sporadically funny and lacks a good story to really engage. Like the first film, there aren't loads of film etc reference gags or really adult material so the pressure was really on the story to engage. Sadly it didn't and the main thread that involves the two mammoths was all a bit obvious and annoyingly sentimental. It doesn't help that the whole idea of Ellie being a possum and indeed her character, being irritating but even ignoring this the story is pretty obvious and slightly dull. The subplots are hardly there at all and, although Sid and Diego's parts are amusing, they contribute to the film feeling episodic and patchy. Scrat was the only reliable part of the film, producing the biggest laughs away from the plot, but he was relied on too much towards the end. It is a shame because the threat of the two fish monsters early on suggested that this would be a darker film with a real sense of urgency and peril  sadly this early promise was never delivered.The voice cast are mostly solid enough but nobody has enough of a memorable or fun character to really lift the material. Romano is solid but he hasn't the depth to bring the script to life. Latifah has continued her quest to become the actress I would cross a busy road to avoid by turning in yet another obvious performance that grated on me from start to finish. OK so her material is weak but her delivery is poor and she had nothing of interest going on at all. Leguizamo is cut away from the main film but is still fun and gave a few laughs. Leary is so-so again, trading solely off his tough, dark voice but not having anything other than that to work with. Peck and Scott are both pretty weak and don't add much but smaller turns are generally amusing from Leno, Arnett and a few others. Director Saldanha seems unsure what he is trying to do and is a bit all over the place in terms of mood  being dark one moment and then far too light the next, producing long flat moments before suddenly producing an inspired musical moment with the vultures! Overall then a pretty disappointing film. It has just about enough in the asides to be amusing but the sum of its parts is sadly not much. Scrat is funny but the rest is far too hit and miss and the obvious main plot will find many bored - adults and kids alike. A so-so film that does enough to distract then, but in a genre where the standards have been consistently set high, Ice Age 2 just wasn't good enough to cut it for me.",Null,2,3,19 April 2006
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Solid matinée fare but needed more spark, comedy, thrills and build to make it more than that
","I never played this video game but as an Assassin's Creed fan I can see how it must have played and, although games are always best played rather than watched (ask my girlfriend – she knows), lots of films have made free-running related action into quite thrilling sequences or films (Casino Royale, District 13 come to mind). The plot here sees a Prince fleeing after being accused of the murder of his father the King. With him he takes the beautiful princess of the city they have just sacked, although her reasons for coming along are less to do with him and more to do with the supernatural dagger he has looted, unaware of its power. As he tries to clear his name, he comes to realise that the dagger was the target all along and that someone has been after it from the very start.Prince of Persia was one of several blockbusters that I ignored in 2010, partly because of the poor word of mouth and reviews but also to do with my decreased appetite for overpriced cinema tickets just to watch rubbish marketed as gold. I cannot remember a lot of dislike for this film though, but it was just the lack of positive reviews that made me throw it to the back of my mind with a note to maybe check it out on DVD or happily wait 4 years for it to wash up for free on terrestrial television. Anyway, I watched it sooner than that but my attitude of apathy was the same as I was told it was the movie choice for the evening! However I quite enjoyed it for what it was. It has enough solid qualities to make it work and entertain for about two hours, even if it is entirely forgettable once you eject it from the player! The plot is clunky and obvious but it sets up frequent chases and action sequences that perhaps don't provide substance but at least provide distracting noise, which is good enough for a Friday night.Well, perhaps not Friday night but this is a really good matinée for a wet Saturday or Sunday afternoon – which in years to come will be where it plays well to a family audience. The action is solid, providing lots of near misses and close escapes and lots of impressive free-running. It isn't ever really thrilling though and the danger never feels real – no matter who dies around them, one never feels like the lead two are ever in real peril. This sort of flattens things as it misses this quality and at the same time it can apply to other aspects as well because the film does generally seem to be close but still lacking something. A spark perhaps? It has it at times because it has the comedy, it has the potential thrills, it has some good chemistry but it never quite makes everything work as it should, which is why it didn't thrill.I hate the franchise but the first Pirates of the Caribbean film got it right – fun, exciting and all just there to be enjoyed and not take too seriously; Prince of Persia has the same sort of feel but doesn't quite carry it off. I enjoyed Gyllenhaal even if his accent took a minute to get used to. He is fit enough to convince in the action and he gives us a bit of a cheeky swagger that constantly reminds us we are supposed to be enjoying the film. Arterton works reasonably well with him but never to the point where they had a real spark or energy from their pairing. Kingsley does his usual shtick without ever appearing to be working too hard but fortunately we have Alfred Molina bouncing around because he is consistently fun and adds an element of irreverent comedy into proceedings. The supporting cast are all decent enough as all they do is make sure and not be bad. Mike Newell was an odd choice for director and he doesn't really seem suited to it – his direction is solid but not thrilling, like the film as a whole really.Overall Prince of Persia will be coming soon to a Saturday afternoon slot near you and it will fit in there perfectly. It is a solid family matinée with action without real peril, death without blood, romance without sex or nudity ad all set in a fantasy world that is safe and distant. I can see why audiences generally didn't fancy it when it was being pushed as the big movie of that weekend, but it is good enough and bland enough to do the job when under less of a spotlight.",Null,1,2,13 March 2011
Balls of Fury," Amusing distraction but nothing more
","Nineteen years ago, Randy Daytona was the golden boy of the US Olympic team in Seoul. A child prodigy, he is a sure thing for the gold medal in the event of table-tennis. Unfortunately, Randy chokes and his father is murdered to make up for the significant financial losses that this meant for him and cruel gangster Feng. Nowadays the lasting shame of this has seen him trading his skills at matinée lunch variety shows to uncaring audiences. This might change though as the FBI need him to infiltrate the high-stakes and totally secret ping-pong tournament organised by none other than Feng himself. The chance to avenge his father is too great to turn down, but can Randy overcome his fear of failure and his rusty abilities? Another sport, another film with the humour of Dodgeball, Beerfest, Semi-Pro and so on  indeed so familiar is Balls of Fury that it needs to do very little to introduce itself since you pretty much know what you're getting into. In terms of the genre (for this is almost populated enough to be called a 'genre') the film is not anything special but it does just about do enough to be an amusing distraction. The plot is straightforward and is used to produce the usual comedy but without as many laughs as I expected. There are some really funny and clever moments but they are in the minority and mostly the film concentrates on moving the plot forward with a generally amusing air.The casting has lots of familiar faces and generally everyone does well. I've not really seen Fogler in much else but on the evidence of this he is reasonably suited to the 'comedy big man' role but not much else. Lopez and Hong support him solidly enough, while Maggie Q does what she does best  look thin and pretty. The rest of the cast features a surprising amount of faces  few of whom have a great deal to do. Walken could have done more with better material to play up on his type-casting but at times he does look a little pained. Patrick, Crews, Lee and Bader are tiny additions who don't add more than a few laughs each  special mention to Tyler though, who does the 'stunning Amazonian' thing and makes it look easy, again a shame that the film doesn't give her more to do with it.Balls of Fury is not a great film by any means. Even by the standards of its genre it is only an amusing distracting  which will do for some but for the majority of viewers will be able to find funnier films based on essentially the same ideas.",Null,0,3,4 August 2008
Ted," Really depends on whether you like Family Guy or not (SPOILER)
","The plot here centers around a bear that magically came to life due to the wish of a young boy. After a brief introduction where we see this bear be a celebrity and the world be captivated by him, we jump forward in time where the world has gotten used to it and life has gone on and now the boy and his bear are still friends but friends that some week, work in low-level jobs and try to get their lives together. In terms of plotting this is focused on the relationship between John and Lori in regard how Ted messes it up – it is a very simple plot that allows for lots of crude yet funny escapades along the way. A sub-plot about another family who wants the bear seems to exist solely to provide a dramatic conclusion and doesn't really fit.This very simple plot means that the film will stand or fall based on the viewer's sense of humor. If you like Family Guy with its non-PC characters, crude tone and constant reference points then the film will more than likely work for you, if not then it probably won't. The reason for this is because the wit and humor is very specific; it is unfair to suggest it is not intelligent just because it is crude, but it is worth saying that this isn't Woody Allen any more than it is as basic as pratfalls or fart jokes. The majority of the jokes come from the creation of Ted – specifically that he is a teddy bear who says terrible things, does drugs and hangs out with hookers – it is a simple character in that regard and the humor follows that pattern. The delivery is what makes it work though.MacFarlane may be rather one-note, but that note is a good one. His writing and delivery of lines is generally very funny and it is telling that I never even once thought about what a good 'special effect' Ted was (although he is) because I was too busy thinking of him as a character. Wahlberg also deserves a lot of credit; as daft as the film is or as demeaning as some of his performance is, he always goes with it and his performance with his invisible co-star is really good whether it is in dialogue scenes or in the more physical scenes. Likewise Kunis goes with it really well and manages to do enough to carry the actual plot while also helping the comedy.It isn't a brilliant film though and even fans of MacFarlane will acknowledge there are bits that don't work or that really force the point. For example as a child of the era, I loved the Flash Gordon references and the silly extent to which it takes them, but mostly it wasn't particularly smart so much as it was wonderfully silly and as a result I imagine many others will see it as tiresomely silly. The plot is simplistic and messy, the humor is mostly crude and the references are generally heavy, but it had me laughing and the performances from the lead three are all strong as they 'get it' and their delivery really helps the whole thing hang together.",Null,3,5,10 November 2012
Coffee and Cigarettes," A very mixed bag but fans of Jarmusch will enjoy it and it does have a certain curiosity value to cover the weaknesses
","In hundreds of diners each day, people meet up for a chat, a cup of coffee and perhaps a cigarette. In this film we see a handful of such meetings involving all sorts  famous singers, cousins, twins, strangers or even just people by themselves. As in real life, the moods, aims and directions of each meeting are different and end different ways for the characters involved and, well, that's about as close to a 'plot' summary as I can get! As a lover of short films I was looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed to be a collection of shorts made over quite a period, rather than being a collection of vignettes as in, say, Blue in the Face. However it quickly became evident that these segments would mostly not stand up on their own in the way a good short film would and they are much more just like sketches rather than shorts. Anyway, aside from the issue of definitions, this is still a very hit and miss affair with the majority being near-misses of half-hits, only a couple of them would I watch again on their own. Strange to Meet You is not that good; Twins is interesting and was a curiosity to me for having two of Spike Lee's siblings in it; Renee didn't do anything for me; No Problem was cool but pretty empty. However I did think that Somewhere in California was strong; Those Things Will Kill Ya was obvious but quite enjoyable; Cousins was interesting and engaging; Cousins? was sharp and enjoyable while Delirium was strangely comical although I probably enjoyed it more for the people than the content.The cast do reasonably well within the material but I think some are better than others; as you might expect, I was more impressed with the acting in the shorts that I found most interesting  although I recognise that that is probably an unfair judgement of the performances. The direction is fairly static but also quite stylish and with a nice sense of place in each location; the black and white perhaps adds it more credibility but other than that I didn't see the reason other than maybe adding a consistency in colour that the material didn't provide.Overall this is not as good as I had hoped but in fairness maybe I had my hopes unreasonably high. It does do what it claims to do by being a mixed collection of sketches; all of them are good enough to fill their short running times but not all of them are worth seeing. The weak ones and the good ones come pretty much 50/50 and you need to decide for yourself whether or not those odds make it worth your while. Fans of Jarmusch and 'offbeat' films will likely enjoy it but I reckon the casual viewer may end up left a bit cold and unimpressed by it.",Null,5,8,22 April 2005
Oldboy," Dark, stylish, engaging stuff that will appeal to modern audiences even if the lack of depth is a problem
","Having been collected in a drunken state from the police station by his friend, Oh Dae-su vanishes from the street and awakes in a locked room. Months later he knows nothing more about why he is imprisoned and is brought food. A year later he has been framed for the murder of his wife but still is none the wiser why he has been imprisoned or by whom. Fifteen years pass by and Dae-su has spent most of them driven by rage an a desire to get free from his prison. A month from breaking though the wall he is gassed and dumped on a roof garden inside a suitcase.Being, in essence, a wuss, I took my time getting round to watching this film and braced myself when channel 4 trailed it with warnings for brutal violence, torture, sexual scenes and 'a scene where a man eats a live octopus'  suffice to say I was ready that this film wasn't going to be Disney. That said there is a feel of graphic novel about this (I think this is where the material has come from) and for all its brutality there is a dark sense of humour running across it. The plot is engaging mainly due to the level of mystery in it and I was held unto the end. The conclusion is drawn out for a bit too long but it is still quite clever and satisfyingly downbeat. Viewers should brace themselves for a certain amount of lack of logic across the plot  this comes with the heavily stylised territory and doesn't damage the arch of the film that much.It is of course violent; there is no disputing that, and I did have to look away from the screen on several occasions. The torture scenes and such are within a dark context though and I found it a lot less violent than some Hollywood films that draw pleasure from gore and death  here it is dark and unpleasant and rarely exciting. Park's direction is impressive and the film has a great fell to it with plenty of style and clever touches but not to the point where it dominates proceedings  the style is the polish, not the whole show. The cast work surprisingly well considering that the depth of the film and characters does rely heavily on the rather convoluted and unrealistic setup. Choi is a powerful heart to the film, starting as a flabby drunk, transforming with rage and hate to the point of looking totally different while also making other significant shifts. The film very much belongs to him but he is well supported throughout. With perhaps weaker characters to work with Kang is good as Mido while Yu turns in a compelling and sinister character without ever losing touch with what has been driving him all these years.Overall then an impressively dark and compelling film. The violent scenes (and one intense scene of animal cruelty) will put many off, as will the fact that the film doesn't happen in a real world but regardless it is stylish, engaging and compelling.",Null,17,69,23 November 2006
Spider-Man 2," A damn near perfect summer blockbuster
","Two years on from defeating the Green Goblin, Peter Parker is having a harder time meeting the ongoing expectations of the public. On top of this the double life is taking its strain on his job, his personal life and his ability to even cast webs. Parker decides enough is enough and throws it all in  after all, he is only one man. Meanwhile, A brilliant scientist, Dr Octavius sees his life's work on a fusion reactor explode  killing his wife. Wife the protective device on his computerised arms broken, Dr Octavius loses his grip on sanity and starts to rebuild his reactor using money and materials from crime. With him seemingly intent on destruction, Parker must decide if the needs of others outweigh his own.With many blockbusters falling at the opening weekend this summer, the title of 'summer's best' was still up for grabs when I arrived at the cinema to watch Spiderman 2 (having only the week earlier given it the miss in favour of lighter fare). Two hours later I emerged having enjoyed one of the most entertaining popcorn films I'll probably see all year. The plot is more than able to fill the running time and, although the action scenes often have large gaps between them, there are no moments where I was bored  even if there are a few moments where the film slightly slows. The complexity of the hero is the main thing  he is an unwilling hero and the strain shows well on him. Even the potentially ponderous thread with Mary-Jane plays pretty well for the most part.The villain of the piece is similar to the Green Goblin of the first film in that he is a scientist driven to madness by 'voices' who we want to lose as well as feeling for  more tragic than evil. Where Dafoe was great as the Goblin, the silly costume hindered the actor, here Molina has no such obstacle and does very well  carrying off the 'voices' scene without it looking silly  it is only a shame that he has so little screen time as a person (he has little time anyway  but the vast majority of it is throwing cars around). With these complex people as the fronts it is any wonder that the script has no problem being surprisingly strong for a summer action movie. You could read meaning into most of it but it is hard to not see the New York people on the train carrying the prone body of Spiderman backwards as having a bigger significance  a surprisingly poignant movie after a big effects-driven scene. The script also throws in a real mix of emotions  perfect for a film that is more about being an exciting ride than a piece of art. Plenty of it is very funny, some of it is touching, some of it is about character and some of it, well, some of it is about cars being thrown through windows! And of course the latter is what we have come for.In terms of action, the several big action sequences are very enjoyable and put the skirmishes from the first movie very much in the shade. Part of this is down to the increased intensity of the fights due to the close combat nature of the character but it is hard not to be impressed by the impact of the vastly improved effects. In the first movie I struggled occasionally to get past the fact that some of it (not all but some) looked very much like an average playstation game. Here the effects are great; sure, you can still tell when a mid-shot of a character is real or CGI but they are much more convincing and they are used a lot better  making it easier to accept them as real for the purposes of the film. Of course what really makes the action sequences is Raimi's great direction. He is very able in the smaller moments but he is fantastic in the massive action scenes that he pulls together. At times his direction is very clever and my favourite 'reference' scene is also the one that surprised me that it was rated PG. In a very clear reference to Evil Dead, doctors are hammered by Dr Octopus' arms for the first time  dragged screaming (ED's trees) and tackling it with bone saws (Ash's chain saw). It was a very intense scene and, with it being in a PG, it acts as proof that the BBFC are not as strict as the moaners would have us believe.Working with this direction, the cast all do really well. Maguire takes the pratfalls, the moral questions, the romance and the action equally as well. He is very much the likable everyman that the film needs Spiderman to be and he is good throughout. Dunst has talked about her desire to do more than just this type of film and, from this, I can see why. Although she has some good scenes, generally she is sidelined and it is to her credit that she does as well as she does with comparatively little to work with. Molina is given too little time and lacks a really strong scene of emotion in the same way that Dafoe did in front of the mirror but he still does well. I didn't feel his pain as much as I really should have done but that was more down to his low screen time rather than his performance. Franco is good but a bit too one-dimensional; given that the third film will be very dependent on him I'm hoping he can step up to the plate more than he did here. Of the support cast, once again it is a wonderfully OTT Simmons who steals every scene he is in  he is so good that I never once saw him as his Oz character  an association I never thought he'd be able to break but he did  and he did it hilariously. Cameos from Campbell, Raimi and Dafoe are all enjoyable and add to their scenes.Overall this is not a perfect film and I am bemused by its appearance in the top 250 list here but it does basically everything it sets out to do and does it in a manner that puts this years' other blockbusters in the shade. The script is clever, interesting and involving; the characters are complex and pretty well drawn while the film delivers laughs as frequently as it does action. With improved effects and some very impressive action scenes this is definitely the movie to sue in a summer full of misses and average thrills.",Null,89,146,23 August 2004
Billy Elliot," Over-hyped but a low-key effective story about being true to ones self
","While his father and older brother are involved in the miner's strikes, Billy is still at school. When the ballet class has to share a room with Billy's boxing club he becomes interested in the class and joins it secretly.  When his family find out they go spare and stop him going, but Billy meets secretly with his teacher Mrs Wilkinson and continues. Eventually Mrs Wilkinson decides Billy may be good enough for auditioning for the Royal Ballet School in London  but how can he do it without his father's permission?It seems that any British film that isn't rubbish gets hyped up and spread all over the place like the new Messiah.  Billy Elliot was one such film and it suffers a little from the weight of expectation this puts on it's shoulders.  Like many recent British hits, this is a low-key story that is a slow burn rather than a Hollywood `wow' film that needs to be hyped up because it's all about spectacle and not story.  Here the focus is all on the simple theme of `to one's self be true' (just like Babe!).  The plot develops slowly, sounds simple but encompasses the miner's strikes etc in compliment to the central tale.The strength of the film is not in the telling but in the characters.  They are allowed time to develop and they change in ways that would be comical if they were just one-dimensional but, because they are fuller people we believe them and are taken in by them.  It's not flawless and some of the characters are a little weak  Billy's cross-dressing friend is a little too heavy in the film's `be yourself' message.The acting is all very good.  Bell is excellent as Billy  bringing out the anger, freedom and bashfulness.  Lewis as his father and Draven as the brother are better in some ways as they must keep their emotions just visible under masculinity, only letting them out occasionally.  www is OK and does her usual working class routine that she does so well, but Bell is easily the best, holding our attention effortlessly.Overall this film suffered from being overhyped to the point that most people expected to be totally blown away.  It isn't like that  it's more a slow, simple story that will involve you bit by bit so that you're fully involved for the low-key emotional finish.",Null,3,6,9 January 2003
The Fifth Element," Plot wise it is weak and rather silly but, for all its weak points it is great fun with a good sense of energy and wonderful design
","Three hundred years ago, the powerful weapon of the fifth element was removed from Earth. Three hundred years later and pure evil has stirred in the far reaches of space  and is heading straight for Earth, with traditional weapons unable to stop it. When the Fifth Element is returned, the ship is attacked and seemingly lost  but scientists are able to recreate the fifth element and are surprised to find it is a beautiful young woman, Leeloo. When Leeloo escapes custody she is helped by ex-army taxi driver Korben Dallas. Korben takes her to the priest she names, but he finds that everyone wants her for one reason or another  then he finds that both the army and the priest need him to go on a mission to reclaim the missing four stones and save the Earth from evil.I have seen this film several times and will usually come back to it if I find myself in the mood  but yet I also find myself thinking of its flaws whenever anyone asks me about it. I can't understand why I do this because I really do enjoy this film even though there is much I sort of dislike about it. The plot is one of the weak points; generally it is quite good as an idea but it has many weak points that make it seem rather silly and overly busy. While this is not enough to really damage the film I know that it has put some people off in some audiences, but for me it was only a minor problem as these rather silly bits were all part of a film that had a great sense of fun running through it. Some of it didn't make much sense and at times I got the feeling that the film had more ideas than it really knew what to do with, but the majority of it worked well. The action is good but you should be prepared for the fact that, like much of the film, it is done with a certain amount of tongue in cheek humour. Suffice to say I never found it dull and it has plenty going on for the majority of the filmVisually is the area where the film is strongest and I could watch it for this alone. The effects are great and are full of imagination as well as looking very impressive. The design work of Dan Weil is very well used and compliments the effects used  the film looks lavish and rich all the way through and matches the wonderful costumes from Jean-Paul Gaultier. Of course much of the praise goes to Luc Besson who has managed to pull this together really well to produce an endlessly impressive film, which manages to be a fun and exciting sci-fi.The casting also backs this idea up and features many performances that are spot on with tongue in cheek performances that match the tone of the film perfectly. Bruce Willis delivers the same, great mocking performance that he tried in Hudson Hawk but here he does it in a film that is better structured and less silly than that one and it works a lot better. He still delivers the goods as an action lead but he puts his tongue just far enough in his cheek so as to be there without hurting the film! I don't want to overdo it (after all  he is Bruce Willis!) but I thought he was very well cast here. Oldman is very hammy but this also works as it matches the humour of the piece. Jovovich had a very difficult role and it is easy to laugh at her baby talk etc but I think she made it work well and gave a good performance against the odds. Holm is pretty good and brings humour to his role as well. Tucker, sadly, fails to do the same as these and his overblown performance doesn't even fit well within this film (god knows where it WOULD fit!) and he only succeeds in being shrill and very annoying throughout  not all his fault, his character is a wholly unnecessary part of the film. The support cast is roundly good and features a raft of famous faces in minor roles including Lee Evans, Brion James, Tricky, Luke Perry and Kim Chan. Generally the cast seem to be right on the same page as their director and compliment the material and tone perfectly.Overall this is far from a perfect film and some may find the humour to be at odds with the sci-fi action; but for my money the fact that most of the film backed up this tongue in cheek tone made it all work. Some of the plot has too many ideas or unnecessary elements but most of it is really good and, combined with mostly good performances and stunning designs and effects make for a film that I will watch many times even if I cannot help but see the weaknesses that many others cannot get past.",Null,83,155,10 July 2004
127 Hours," A bit over-hyped for what it is, but Boyle and Franco make it really engaging and convincing throughout
","There are two things that could or might work against this film. The first thing is that this is the first film from Danny Boyle since the runaway success of Slumdog – so he is a 'big' director now and accordingly the posters for this are everywhere and awards are being muted, the star of Pineapple Express is in the lead and audiences are making it their Saturday night choice. The second of them is the plot in which essentially a rather arrogant and spoilt character gets himself into trouble and gets out of it by learning a 'lesson' about the error of his ways. This plot could easily be on the Hallmark channel daytime schedule right now complete with corny 'I'm learning to be better' music and warm, safe colours everywhere.The problem with the first thing is that, while these things are true, 127 Hours is essentially an independent movie, not a massive blockbuster and it is the sort of smaller fare that critics love and audiences discover – it isn't the film I expect to be on every other bus shelter. So, while it is really good that he made the decision to do a project he wanted to do rather than cashing in with the 'big' Hollywood movie, it may lead some to expect something that the film never pretends to be. Having said that though, in regards the second challenge, thank God that this is a Danny Boyle film and not something picked up by the TV networks or less imaginative director, because this could have been corny, obvious, sentimental and cloying. In fact, Boyle appears to be working against that as much as humanly possible.We have very little time in the film before our character is alone, down a hole and trapped alone. Most of us will know where it is going and the question is how will the next 80 minutes be filled? The content of the film is indeed the character beating himself up a bit over who he is, struggling with hallucinations and become more and more fevered until he decides that he has to do what he has to do. It is really well scripted though and Boyle really delivers in terms of putting it on the screen. I thought the idea of 'self-revelation flashbacks' sounded cheap and obvious as a device, but Boyle does it really well, making them partially remembered, flashes and even when our character is 'in' them, he is still 'in' his current predicament – hard to explain perhaps but it worked much better than a complete scene as a flashback. The one problem that his direction does cause is that I never felt trapped with Aron, because the camera was moving out and around so much – I know they shot it in deliberately confined setting but this didn't really come through. That said, I think that this loss is a price worth paying because it does visually engage and these flourishes and style adds more than it detracts. The soundtrack is odd a times but mostly works really well.Franco is key and this did worry me since Bole says he cast him after seeing how excellent he was in Pineapple Express – a sentiment I really don't agree with, although I though he was likable in a story that was not so likable. Here he is really, really good. He has to do a lot of thinking on his face and he makes this work while also letting his character change over the course of the ordeal. Perhaps we don't get his full character but in terms of the film the performance was really engaging and convincing.Overall 127 Hours is not the big Saturday night drama that it is billed as, it is an indie film that is very contained and not an easy sell if we're honest. However, it is also a very good film with Boyle really making it his own to the benefit of the material, avoiding the traps of sentiment that so many would have fallen into and producing an engaging situation while Franco matches him with a strong performance that easily holds the attention.",Null,9,18,16 January 2011
"I Love You, Man"," Delivers what it sets out to do with an easy to watch comedy
","Paul Rudd has managed to do a good job of delivering a solid 'normal guy' comic lead in comedies that are amusing if not particularly amazing. This is not a criticism though because I do find the films he has been in recently to be perfectly enjoyable, with a consistent comic air and a good handful of laughs spread across a plot that, while not engaging or amazing, is not offensively simple or crass either. This track record is what brought me to I Love You Man because I felt like I knew what to expect from the film and also that I was fairly confident that it would meet my expectations and maybe even be a bit better than I expected. I'm not trying to say that if it was weak that I could enjoy it because I thought it would be weak and was prepared for that, but just that the film needs to deliver what it proposes to do and satisfy on those terms – which given how many poor comedies and blockbusters come out of Hollywood, is not as easy as it sounds.Fortunately, ILYM does do this and it does it in a way that will please the majority of viewers. The plot is simple and sets up the obvious gags but does also produce a solid 'bromance' narrative, which is enjoyable while not saying much more than the basics about the nature of modern men. What helps it a great deal is that it is funny. The tone of it is well maintained and it did keep me in the mood to laugh, which is half the battle. It manages this through the main characters being likable in the most part as well as having plenty of pretty funny asides or episodes based on plot or character, which are again delivered well by a cast containing endless faces that will be familiar to anyone who watches US comedy on even a semi-regular basis.I'm not sure that Paul Rudd is close to being an all-round leading man type of actor but certainly this type of film (like some of his other recent turns) plays to his strengths. He is comically awkward but yet also keeps the audience with him by being easy to like – helped by the film being light on crude or crass comedy, which can put me off some characters. He works well with TV comedian Segel, who is perhaps a less engaging and likable character but does convince within it and is funny. Beyond the two of them everyone else is pretty much in a supporting role and, as well as having lots of famous faces, they do mostly deliver laughs in 'asides'. Pressly and Favreau are both very good at this and steal a lot of scenes. I liked The Office's Jones turn as the fiancé as I generally like her delivery. There are many other faces to recognise (such as Simmons, Samberg, Curtin, Chaandrasekhar, Ferrigno, Wilmore) and some of them do provide value even if others only provide a face.Overall though, ILYM delivers what it sets its stall out to do – which is a gentle and funny comedy that is easy to watch and entertaining even if it is fleeting and not particularly memorable as a film in and of itself. Rudd plays to his strengths and provides the thin plot with a likable and engaging core, while the material is very funny at best and amusing at worst. Not a classic by any means but it has laughs and it has charm.",Null,7,12,20 August 2009
Batman Returns," Entertaining, but far too much focus on spectacle over content
","Evil land developer Max Shreck teams up with sewer dweller The Penguin to plan to take over large areas of real estate.  When Shreck's employee Selina Kyle discovers his plans he kills her, only for her to survive and develop Catwoman as an alter-ego.  Gotham City's regular defender Batman, steps up to battle the villains while, as Bruce Wayne, he begins a romance with the sexually charged Kyle.The second of the Batman series had the possibility to go one of two ways. 1 - it could go darker and look at the character of Batman in more detail and bring out the ambiguous nature of him more.  Or 2 - it could take the blockbuster elements of the first and up the ante.  With Burton on board it was always possible that it would go darker and complex than the first, however instead it panders to the mass audience.  In fairness the studios had a lot of money to make from the films and merchandising so couldn't risk the sequel turning people off.  So here we have a plot that doesn't really matter.  At times it's not really clear why any of the villains are doing what they're doing, the thinnest of reasons suffice - the Penguin simply wants revenge for being dumped in the sewers at birth.With the plot noted on a matchbox, Burton seems happy to concentrate on the set pieces.  With the characters set up in the first film, he now can just jump in at the deep end.  The end result is a endless run of explosions, gadgets and fights.  Keaton is not so effective as he was in the first - mainly because his character isn't developed because we concentrate on the baddies instead.  De Vito is a good Penguin and he doesn't ham as much as Nicholson did.  Pfeiffer is definitely a better female role than Basinger was, but she isn't fully explored.  Walken is always watchable as a bad guy, but here he can't rise above the material.Overall this film bottled the opportunity to build on the dark original. Going for the `bang, bang, boom' audience it throws all it's energy into action and fights.  Overall it's an uncoordinated mess - the name Batman deserved better.",Null,30,62,28 January 2002
Finding Nemo," The now-traditional mix of adult wit and kiddie laughs  although less sharp than usual (but still very funny)
","Scarred by the loss of his wife and eggs, Marlin has over sheltered his only child, Nemo.  However when Nemo's first day at school comes about, that mothering leads Nemo to swim out to the open ocean where he is caught by a scuba diver and be put in a fish tank far away.  Enlisting help from the forgetful Dory, Marlin tracks the boat and his ocean adventure begins.Now as much as a tradition as national holidays, the latest Pixar animation arrives in the UK on a wave (d'oh!) of hype and marketing.  Officially the biggest summer film in the US and all over buses and Happy Meals (which seems a little perverse when you think about it) it is hard not to want to see it or prevent your kids from demanding they see it.  Happily the well establish benchmark of being kiddie friendly but fun for adults is maintained and the film does exactly what you know it will.  The plot is a little like Toy Story's quest but is fleshed out enough to be interesting and the themes of `letting go' and loss are actually quite well handled and will speak more to adults than kids.The slight problem with the film is that is does do just what you expect and the `animated film with adult wit and kiddie characters' stuff is hardly cutting edge anymore.  However this is a picky flaw as it is still very good fun.  It may not be the strongest of this genre, indeed some bits flag and the sentimental core, while a break from cruel humour or sarcasm, does then to slow things down a bit at times.The adult references are all good but not as frequent as I'd have liked  they seem to be separate from the main flow where I wanted them integral with all of it.  Clever homage's to Jaws (Bruce was the pet name of the rubber shark) and The Birds are distracting and make you feel good about yourself, and the banter is mostly witty if lacking a real sharpness at times.The voice cast are all good are quite an all star bunch.  Brooks does a workmanlike job in the lead  it must be said I didn't think he distinguished himself but then he did have to carry the moral weight of the film.  DeGeneres is much better and her dippy character is a delight at times.  The support cast is not as deep and fun as in other films  Janney and Dafoe are both fun in the tank (as are all the tank characters) it's just that none of them are really consistent.  My favourite characters were the one word seagulls  `mine?'Overall I have been unfair to this film in my review.  If I saw this in isolation I would be praising it to the roof, however using the others as a benchmark this does have a few weaknesses that show signs of wear and tear in the genre.  Not to cancel everything I have said, these weaknesses are all things that I realised after I had watched it  while I was watching it I was too busy laughing!  Biggest downside for me though  no comedy outtakes, booooooo!",Null,11,20,30 September 2003
Blade," Enjoyably stylish flick that gets the dark tone almost right
","Blade was only a foetus when his mother was attacked by vampires and left for dead.  When he is born he is born a half-breed.  As an adult he has been joined by Abraham Whistler, a vampire hunter, to fight the secret war against the vampire culture.  He hunts the impure-blood vampire Deacon Frost who plans to summon La Magra - the Blood God.Now approaching it's second sequel, this film was a dark surprise to me as I didn't expect too much from it.  The plot sees Blade hunting a dangerous vampire seeing to unleash the power of La Magra and take vampires from their shadows into the real world; we also get a bit of back story as well. This plot gives all the best lines to the vampires and not enough good scenes with Blade himself.  I like Blade for the same reason as I like Batman - they are both messed up superheroes of a sort.  The film tells us how Blade was created but it doesn't delve deep enough for my tastes - only once or twice did I really get a feel for his cruel, darker nature (`Please, I only work for them').  I suppose this was to be expected and it certainly manages the darker tone much better than the Batman films did (in the long run).The action is good although it never really gets to the peak of the opening nightclub scene but is good nonetheless.  Some of the effects in the final fight are a bit lacking and they make the usual horror movie mistake of showing too much and having it be less effective than the build up and suggestion of the monster was.Snipes doesn't exactly display a great emotional range here but he is good in the title role nonetheless.  He is a commanding presence and physically good at the action stuff.  Dorff is pretty good as the main vampire - he is slick and plays it well to be a good representation of the `new breed' as the script requires.  Kristofferson is cool and Wright is sexy while still being a good actress!  The support cast contains no real standouts; Lathan is no more than a cameo and isn't really good while people like Lords only stick in the memory due to their name and not their performance.Overall this is an enjoyably slick vampire/action movie.  The end product may be more style than substance but the character of Blade is darkly interesting, even if neither Snipes nor the film really give too much away in terms of his inner workings.  I have yet to see the sequel but I would hope that it keeps the same dark tone that makes this film stand out.",Null,33,44,20 January 2004
Superbad," Still an obvious genre comedy but rises above this to a point thanks to some imaginative 'geeky' touches

However when Seth gets invited over to a party with a girl in his home economics class he makes rash promises in regards buying alcohol for the whole party. To Seth, Evan and friend Fogell the biggest challenge initially appears to be buying alcohol with a rather unconvincing fake ID card but this soon becomes even more difficult than they imagined due to a robbery, a car accident, inept cops and several other obstacles.Superbad came out shortly after Knocked Up and the hype surrounding that sort of continued to wash over this film. At the time I didn't bother with it because I wasn't sold on the trailers but after thinking that Knocked Up was quite good I decided to check it out. What I found was a film that doesn't want to be a simple genre movie but mostly is just that. The plot betrays this more than anything else since it is a bit of a geek fantasy with plenty of action and parties. So far so genre and indeed those that actively dislike the genre will not be won over by this, however that doesn't mean that it is just a basic genre film.What makes it a bit better than it could have been is that the comedy does have some nice imaginative touches thanks to the writing of Rogen and Goldberg. This is not to say that it is brilliant but just that it is informed by a modern feel that connects with those in the generation who do talk in pop-culture references and such. This aspect of it does raise it above the rather obvious narrative and I did find myself chuckling along to it regardless. The cast help it a great deal. Cera dominates by bringing his 'Arrested Development' awkwardness to the role. Hill a bit more obvious as he fills a more traditional genre role but does so with good 'fat kid' humour. Mintz-Plasse is very much a simple physical gag but he is an enjoyable one and works well with Rogen and Hader despite their thread being one of the dumbest parts of the film.Overall then a reasonably enjoyable genre comedy that benefits from the writing of current 'men of the moment' Rogen and Goldberg as well as Cera being in the cast. Not good enough to get those who don't like the genre to enjoy it and not the brilliant comedy it was hailed as but it is still a pretty good entry in a mostly so-so genre.",Null,5,11,25 May 2008
Creed," Rides the formula well and is professionally done, even if the finale is not as thrilling as it needed to be
","A lot of hype and buzz around this film, with it mentioned around the Oscars to the extent that one could almost forget that it is just a Rocky sequel. This is more or less what it is though, albeit that the film does it well. The formula is played out as you expect as we have a journey which is both physical and emotional, with plenty of montage moments, and of course the traditional big fight at the end. In doing this the film is nicely judged to play on the emotions not only for the film but also for the previous ones. The writing is unsurprising throughout, but it benefits from a good cast – in particular a very fine lead from Jordan, who is likable and engaging.Those wringing their hands over him not being nominated for best actor perhaps are mistaking charisma for acting – he has both but it is not a brilliant performance, although he has some in his past and probably many ahead of him. Stallone plays the nostalgia and sentiment well, adding to the charisma, while Thompson is sparky and fun albeit in a hugely familiar role for this type of film. Mostly the film rides the clichés well, making the film work thanks to the stars involved. The writing limits it, with scenes mostly spelt out for the viewer, but it hangs together well. The boxing action is mostly good, with the single tracking shot bout being the most engaging. The finale is solid but is a little lacking in thrills, even if it does do the job well enough for the level which the film is mostly pitched.",Null,0,1,2 July 2016
The Great Dictator," An impassioned and funny satire
","During the first world war, a clumsy Jewish soldier saves the life of career soldier Schultz but in the process loses his memory. Many years later he recovers and returns to his barber shop but the country of Tomania has changed from what he would remember (if he could remember it). The Dictator Adenoid Hynkel has laid claim to the country and is mercilessly persecuting the Jewish people. While Hynkel continues his political persecutions (which will next extend to brunettes), the unassuming barber finds himself in the midst of a form of resistance movement.Although it is considered a classic, I had never actually seen this film. At the end of a week where I had not only seen Little Man but also Norbit, I felt like perhaps my film-watching choices were not the best I could be making and decided to come to this next. I don't normally like to step into context when watching a film because my enjoyment of it (or not) is based on a modern viewing, but with Great Dictator it is important to note that Chaplin did not decide to do this film in the political climate that we now associate with Hitler and the Nazi party. At the time production started even Britain was not at war with Germany. So one does have to appreciate the career risks that Chaplin was taking by mocking an European leader so far from America. Of course time quickly showed his instincts to be correct and the film has lost none of its relevance.Being his first all sound talky, I was impressed by how Chaplin does so well with the comedy from the dialogue as well as the physical side. The film is very funny although it should be noted that those expecting the quick-fire of gags associated with his best silent shorts will be a touch disappointed because it is more of a 'proper' film with a plot and events rather than just setups for jokes. In regards the plotting, it is not always as effective as it could have been but this is understandable with the nature of the film. This is best seen in the concluding speech, which in regards plotting is not a great ending but in terms of using the film to make an impassioned plea to the world, it is hard to criticise. As an actor Chaplin does surprisingly well as the barber, with a real sense of pain and longing in his turn. As Hynkel, he is funnier but not as smart in the style of comedy. The supporting cast is mostly very good. I was very impressed by Goddard's performance but of course my favourite one was Jack Oakie's wonderful Napaloni.The Great Dictator is undoubtedly a film of significance in regards cinema history but this does not mean that it is not interesting and funny at the same time. The nature of it means that it is neither as strong a story nor as funny as one would hope but as a total package it is hard to fault. There are funnier Chaplin films from earlier in his career but this is one definitely worth seeing.",Null,1,2,15 June 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The noise and effects may distract but otherwise it is a fairly empty blockbuster that doesn't really engage on any level
","If you remember a week or so before this film was released anywhere, the news outlets were reporting that a work print of the film was being downloaded by tens of thousands of internet users around the world. This copy was only partially finished and was missing a lot of music and finalised special effects, with safety lines etc still being clearly visible. The usual talking heads bemoaned internet piracy, Hugh Jackman said he was disappointed that people would watch a film that was not yet what the makers wanted it to be and the FBI were supposedly involved in the investigation of this leaked copy. Having finally seen Wolverine for myself I have to look back on all this fuss and wonder why so many people bothered downloading an unfinished version of this film (other than to make a point that they could do so) because given how average the completed film is, I cannot think of much worth seeing if the effects are unfinished.Wolverine is a summer blockbuster and a film that you could fairly expect to be heavily reliant on action and special effects and you would be right, because there is not a lot else here for the viewer. The plot has its moments but generally there is no atmosphere to it. The brother relationship leads only to two hairy men running at one another – there isn't any real tension or drama between the characters beyond the superficial level needed to trigger the action sequences. Surprisingly, considering how loved Wolverine is by fans and casual viewers alike, there is very little in the way of excitement about seeing this character develop and become the weapon that he is when most of us met him for the first time. What we do get though is a straightforward narrative which produces lots of action sequences and parades a lot of comic-book characters in and out for those that care about such things (which, although I recognise many of them with ease, I don't care if they are just there for the sake of saying they are there). As such it does enough to be passable and set up the action sequences which are, after all, the only reason the majority of us are here.Shame then that these too feel very average in the whole. Technically I'm sure it is all impressive but none of it really has much in the way of excitement or immediacy, leaving me watching things explode etc without ever being emotionally involved. It is definitely a film from the Mummy Returns school of action film-making in this regard and like this franchise, one never forgets that the visual effects are just that – computer creations that aren't real and pose no threat. It is not that they are 'bad' effects but just that the use of visual effects is across the entire film to the point where green screen sections are so apparently green screen creations that it does hurt the film and act as another barrier in how one gets into the action. Like I say, given this is the deal with the final film I wondered why anyone would have stuck with the film in an unfinished state.The cast and characters are varied. Jackman does his usual stuff as Wolverine; grizzled expression, tough stare, toned and muscular stance. The film gives him a few moments of emotion beyond the basic rage used in action sequences but he cannot do anything of real interest. Schreiber has a better time of it because he does have an evil glint to his performance that makes him more interesting and dangerous. Huston plays Striker reasonably well and offers up a solid bad guy. The addition of the other characters/cast is where the problem comes from. I am not a real comic fan but I can understand why those that are would object to the treatment of some of their characters here. Not only are some of the characters wheeled in for almost no reason (Gambit, Cyclops) but some characters are changed for the worse (Deadpool) and others are simply played by bad actors (Will.i.am is not a name I want to see on the credits of another film any time soon).Overall Wolverine stands as the film that it appears to be a first glance – a blockbuster with plenty of spectacle but not a lot else, which of course feeds back into the action as it detaches the viewer, thus making it feel even more like empty spectacle. It isn't as bad as some say but there isn't a great deal to recommend it for once you take it out of its home turf of 'heavily promoted summer global release', where the scale, newness and noise may have done enough to impress.",Null,3,6,19 January 2010
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Silly fluff but not without some entertainment value
","Andie Anderson is a writer for women's magazine Composure. For her next 'how to' article she decides to write about how to lose a man in 10 days, by picking up a guy and then doing all the bad stuff women usually do (calling loads, being clingy) to drive him away in less than a week and a half. Meanwhile Ben Barry is a slick advertising exec who has just been beaten to a big diamond contract by two female colleagues. He challenges them in front of the client by saying that selling diamonds to women is just like selling love to women and proposes that he make a girl fall in love with him before the sales pitch in 10 days  if he succeeds then he wins the contact. However his colleague Spears spots Anderson and, knowing about her proposed story, points Ben in her direction. So begins a short relationship where Ben tries to win over a woman who is actively trying to push him away.Early on this film is very forced in how it sets up the actual plot, which is perhaps understandable when you think about how very unlikely the whole thing is. However once it manages to swallow this very big pill, it moves forward with good humour by only focusing on the moment and trading on the charisma of the stars. Of course by doing this it means it never gets beyond the superficial and silly, not a major problem since it is quite fun at times. Of course it is very predictable and anyone who doesn't know where it is going probably hasn't long come out the womb! The predictability of the story does mean that, when it does have to bring the film to a close, it isn't that great and losses the fun of the main body. Fans of clichéd rom-coms will love it because it serves up just what you expect and does it with solid laughs.The cast are a big plus because the lead two work well together and almost (almost) carry off the near-impossible task of selling their weird character dynamics between them. Neither McConaughey or Hudson are people that I would make much effort to seek out (although the former is OK) but here they work well together and have a nice chemistry and delivery that is funny and convinced me that maybe they did have a spark below all the betting and game playing. Support from Goldberg and Lennon was amusing but underused, while Michele and Harlow make for good turns and eye candy.Overall this is a predictable and obvious stuff that romcom fans will probably eat up. For the rest of us, it is probably too simplistic and forced but the middle section is fun and maybe even fun enough to get you into in and past the clunky ending that we all knew was coming. Silly fluff but not without some entertainment value.",Null,1,4,28 May 2006
That Thing You Do!," Lacking a bit of depth but breezy and enjoyable with a nice sense of period
","In small town America, a group of friends gain a new drummer in the shape of Guy Patterson and a new band name in the 'One-ders'. Getting the crowd going at their school competition with their catchy number 'That Thing You Do', the One-ders get offered a gig at a local bar. The local buzz takes a few minutes to get going but soon their song is the talk of the town's youth and they decide to print the record up themselves. When a small time manager picks them up they get a few more gigs but things really start to move when they get signed by Play-tone and manager Mr White. However with increasing fame comes the adrenalin rush of success but then tensions, creative differences, distractions and all the stresses of their 15 minutes.Acting as writer and director, Tom Hanks draws on the idea of fame and the setting of the mid-sixties to create a film that is fun even if it never consistently has the depth that it needed to make it more of a memorable affair. The plot is the rise and eventual fall of the band  this is not a spoiler as the point of the film is that they will be a one-hit wonder; it is enjoyable on this level because it has much that is recognisable and easily referenced to the experience of real groups down the years. It doesn't make these references in a heavy way but mostly with good humour and pace; only really towards the end does the script stumble a bit as it seems to realise that it needs substance to make a good ending and then tries too hard with too little. Outside of this though, it mostly moves very slickly and made for an enjoyable watch even if it isn't that memorable. It was amusing without ever being hilarious; well set in the period without ever having a lot of style to it and interesting without ever really getting beyond the basic pigeonholed characters (goofy one, creative one, girlfriend of the band etc).The cast helps by matching the breezy feel for the film but they do tend to struggle when anything more is asked of them. Scott is a point in case; he is asked to carry the film, which he does do when it is all slick but the attempts at substance see him seemingly unsure of what to do. Tyler is in the same sort of boat but is still a good presence. Zahn is funny without being annoying; Schaech has a clear character and plays it well and Hanks makes sure he has a good support role for himself. The support cast has lots of faces in there with minor roles for Cobbs, Ribisi, Theron and others.Overall this is an OK film that is enjoyably breezy and 'nice'. It references well enough to be recognisable but it doesn't have a great deal going on just below the surface that it could have done with to really make it memorable. Like the Wonders themselves, it is fun and slick when it is on but when it is over you'll find yourself quickly moving on to the next film with not too many memories.",Null,5,10,23 April 2005
Alexander," Director's Cut: Not as bad as everyone says but certainly flawed across too many aspects
","The story of Alexander the great, the King of Macedonia who sweep across much of the world as it was known at the time. With flashbacks to his relationship with his father King Philip and mother Olympias, we follow Alexander as a boy taught by Aristotle and his rise to power and first conquers all of Persia before moving eastward into deeper Asia as he attempts to reach the Ocean to return to Macedonia. However this road is tough and his men struggle with his methods of ruling his conquered territories and with the seemingly never-ending quest.Despite the fact that this was slated (maybe because it was slated) I decided to give a try for myself. The only option available to me for rental was the slightly shorter Director's Cut, so I took that one and my comments are based around that  how different it is from the original release into cinemas I'm unsure but it was what I had. Taking the eagle of the early scenes as my guide and looking at film from a great height, it is actually not too bad. Cosmetically it all looks good with lots of money spent on the CGI, the battle scenes, the cast, the costumes and so on. However the reality is that every audience must watch this scene by scene and deal with it line by line and it is at this level where the film doesn't really work.To give it its dues though, the overall sweep is good and the battle scenes are impressive even to this post-Lord of the Rings viewer and it is fair to say that the money is right up on there on the screen. Talk about the narrative, the script, the performances, the delivery though and it is a different story. Whether the story is historically accurate or not I cannot say but, like with many of these things, I am happy to take the overall story as reasonably educational while also recognising that much of it will have been either made up for the sake of the telling or simplified for the same reason. The problem for me was not with the accuracy but more with the script. It is written like speeches rather than conversations; nobody seems to talk so much as proclaim. This makes the characters harder to get into and comes over like the writers were forcing themes rather than building them into their characters.I actually liked the flashback structure as it gave us both elements of Alexander building towards the conclusion of the film. That said though, it is a bit laboured at times and not every timeshift works as well as it should have done or contributes as much as I suspect it was supposed to. Stone's direction is impressive in regards the battle scenes but it is as writer and deliverer of the story that he falls down; even his 'cut' contains structural problems and failings.Without a good script the starry cast mostly struggle. It doesn't help that the themes are mostly handed to the cast in clumps rather than being woven into the dialogue and the characters. Unlike many reviewers I didn't really mind the use of Irish accents; it was a bit funny at first but I got used to the device of the accents representing a certain people. Farrell is left exposed by his director. I do not mean the shot of his balls but more the fact that he seems rudderless in his performance, never being consistent and swinging wildly with each scene. It doesn't help that each line he says is delivered like it is 'the most important thing ever'  with this in mind I didn't care what he looked like, it was more fundamental issues I had with him. Leto, Meyers, Beattie and others provide unremarkable support but the bigger worry is in the A-list names that misfire. Contrary to what some have said, I thought Jolie did a pretty good job with her manipulative character; it is not her fault that she is too young for the role and I'm not entirely sure why she was cast as I can think of a handful of older actresses who could have risen to the role. More disappointing was Dawson who offers little apart from a nude scene (which is an absurdly comic sex scene in itself). Contrary to what my girlfriend might say, I do think Dawson is a good actress and although the male part of me appreciated seeing her naked, I cannot help but wonder why her real talents were wasted in a role that gave her nothing to work with and very little to do anyway. Hopkins is a good narrator and as a device he holds the film together well. Blessed provides a slice of his usual ham then disappears, Plummer likewise while Kilmer does an OK job as the father of the piece.Overall then this is not as terrible a film as the critics would have led you to believe but this is not to be confused with me saying that it is 'good'. The overall sweep of the film is OK while technically it is professional and impressive but the script is poor, the characters delivered on a basic 'and here's the theme for this scene' level, while the performances are either weak or, at best, well-meaning. Like I say it isn't as totally valueless as some have claimed but what potential there is, is mostly missed.",Null,5,7,4 September 2007
Hot Fuzz," Wonderfully witty film where Bad Boys meets Vicar of Dibley
","Nicholas Angel joined the police service and quickly made a name for himself, achieving an arrest rate 400% higher than anyone else and breaking many service records. Unfortunately this makes his colleagues look bad and he is 'promoted' to Sergeant, not in London but in the leafy village of Sandford. Bitter but with no choice, Angel finds himself in the crime-free village and, although he tries to continue his work he finds the only criminals he can arrest are kids and a drunk-driver who turns out to be his new partner, Danny. However the accident rate in Sandford is surely far too high  a fact brought home to Angel when a series of grizzly 'accidents' occur. But will anyone listen in a village where everyone knows no crimes ever occur.It is perhaps unfortunate that Hot Fuzz came out in the same week as gun crime was the main story in the UK and politicians were falling over themselves to 'take action' (because although black people have been being shot for years, the fact that 'good' black people are dieing now means that the Government will act  fantastic). However it is testament to how much fun the film is that no tabloid jumped on this film in the way perhaps they would have knee-jerked against others. The film does glorify the American Hollywood action movie though, which indeed is the joke and entire reason for the film.It does this very well by taking the conventions of the genre and putting them into rural England. The former is really well done and is never as lazy as some spoofs where such conventions are explained then spoofed  here they are part of the film and it works better for it. It is worth noting that they also do small village life to a tee as well. The obsession with keeping the image of the village and intolerance for outsiders is well used within the narrative and will strike a chord with those that know. The action is kept for the final third of the film but is better for it because, for the majority of the film it is witty, but the action is more silly humour  it works, but it is best that it is limited.It is not a perfect film though and those expected a fantastic action movie with loads of laughs will be disappointed. The humour is more about wit and references rather than being a laugh a minute affair. Personally I found it very funny but then some people hated Spaced so I imagine they will also hate this. The direction from Wright is really good. Some of the cuts were a bit frantic at times for my liking but mostly it all looked good and played very well. The cast is roundly good and blessed with stars. Pegg mostly plays it straight and it is an approach that works as the script feeds a lot of the sillier lines to Frost, who delivers them spot on. The two have a great sense of semi-homoerotic camaraderie between them that really fits the action film idea. At first I did worry that the parade of British stars would distract but, aside from the early appearance of Coogan, Nighy and Freeman, it didn't really. Dalton was huge fun, Broadbent fitted his character like old slippers and support is roundly strong from Considine, Woodward, Bailey, Colman, Spall and others.It won't be to everyone tastes then, and those expecting to be rolling in the aisles may be building it up too much. It a witty and English take on the staples of the Hollywood action movie. It is a bit long and gets silly at the end but mostly it is a lot of fun and the same audience that enjoyed Shaun will find this just as much fun.",Null,6,12,26 February 2007
The Mummy," Raiders of the Undead
","In ancient Egypt high priest Imhotep is having an affair with Anck-su-namun, the mistress of his Pharaoh Seti.  When discovered Anck-su-namun kills Seti but both she and Imhotep are captured.  Anck-su-namnun kills herself but Imhotep is caught and mummified alive.  In 1923 adventurer takes Egyptologist Evelyn and her brother Jonathon to the city of the dead.  While searching for the Book of the Living they accidentally release Imhotep who plans to bring Anck-su-namun back to life and to rule the world from beyond the grave.This is very much of a mix between Sam Rami's Evil Dead and Raiders of the lost ark - Raiders of the Undead, if you will.  However it never reaches the level of those.  The plot is so full of holes that even when played tongue in cheek it's still hard to swallow.  The film moves very fast through a large number of action scenes and you never really get the chance to notice the holes until it's finished.  The action scenes are well handled and the special effects are really impressive.Fraser is not a great action hero - he's a great actor, but here he just has to be a wise-cracking hero.  Weisz is pretty dire, she doesn't have much to do and takes her role way too seriously.  Hannah deserves to have better roles, but at least he knows to mess around for the whole film.  Vosloo is good and the support cast are OK.Although the film's all a bit loud, but it's good fun throughout and there's much to enjoy.  Overall it's just another Hollywood blockbuster - loud, brash and clumsy, as long as you don't expect anything more then you won't be disappointed.",Null,0,6,4 February 2002
Constantine," A nice dark try with good effects but the writing and uncertain delivery is a problem
","John Constantine is a gifted man  he can see demons and is responsible for sending them out of our dimension when they break the rules. When he tackles one exorcism where it looks like the demon is actually trying to enter the earth rather than just possess the person, he feels something is up. Similar incidents start him asking questions and finding answers that he doesn't like. Living within the demon underworld and knowing that his only destiny is hell thanks to his attempt at suicide earlier in life, John is bitter and angry. Meanwhile police officer Dodson looks into the suicide of her gifted twin sister and finds a path that leads her to Constantine and into his world.I got the chance to look at this film recently and was looking forward to it because it looked like it would be a dark, cynical thriller with action as well. For some of the time it gets close but it never really hits the mark with any consistency. The plot is simple but the manner of delivery didn't help it; it had far too many moments where it wasn't clear what was happening. I wasn't being thick, a few moments where you are left with questions are fine but to have it happen quite regularly was off-putting and broke up the flow of the story. Without this flow the impact of the story and the scenes is reduced. It is still interesting but it can't settle on a mood that helps. The dark, cynical edge is good but it doesn't go far enough; meanwhile the action misses the Hollywood mark by not being that exciting, despite it mostly looking good and being stylish.The strong effects do help this and they were impressive across the board, supported by some nice touches from Lawrence. At times it gets close to being style over substance but this was a problem that I go into any comic book adaptation expecting to have to forgive (or try to anyway). The cast suffer a bit with the story and also the script, which really doesn't support the dark vision of the director. I don't care if Reeves doesn't look like the comic book character, but I do care that he tried to play it like a darker version of Neo, I wanted more bitterness, more bile, more self-hate  Reeves could say the words to suggest these things but he couldn't convince me he believed them. Weisz is better but she isn't given that many chances to shine. Support from Hounsou, Rossdale, Vince, Stomare, Swinton and others is all OK but the material is where the problem is. I give it credit for being darker than your average comic book Hollywood film but it isn't thorough enough and often it only looks dark, rather than being ingrained through the characters and story.Overall this is an OK film but one that doesn't get close enough to what it should have been. It is dark and impressive on the surface but the story is badly told and the characters are not convincing enough within this world. I still enjoyed it due to the tone but I can fully understand why many people also dislike it and see missed opportunity, because there is plenty of that around too. Worth seeing but you will be asked to forgive a lot as well.",Null,4,9,11 August 2005
The Others," Not that surprising or clever but still an enjoyable and effectively chilling ghost story
","There are 50 doors in Grace Stewart's house and she insists each one must be locked before another is unlocked. Her two children (Anne and Nicholas) are photosensitive and the curtains must always be drawn before they enter the room. Together Grace and her two children live in constant pray that husband and father Charles will somehow return safely from the war. Into the house comes new staff  Mr Tuttle who tends the garden, the mute Lydia and housekeeper Mrs Mills. With her mother's strict teachings and religious slant, Anne confides in Mrs Mills about her sightings of other people, where Grace would punish her for such stories. However it is not long before Grace struggles to understand the noises she hears and things she sees.This review contains no spoilers but I would question why anyone would want to know more about this film before watching it; you know the genre and knowing more can only spoil it for you albeit slightly. I'm not sure why I never got around to seeing this film in the cinema but somehow it slipped my mind and I was surprised to find it on the television recently as it only seemed that it was out recently. Anyway, needless to say I watched it and at the start was a little put out by plot points which seemed to have been a little bit obviously forced in to provide the director with devices to play with (eg the darkness, the locked doors, the silence etc) but very quickly the film made me forget any reservations I may have had. The plot is a simple ghost story that is told with confidence throughout, with a consistently subtle touch from Amenabar; to me he marked himself out as being worth watching with Abre Los Ojos and this film has only made me sure that he can produce the goods. I didn't think the conclusion was as obvious (although it isn't as shocking as it should be) as others have said and, although it hardly shocked me, it was still satisfying to me  partly because it matched the quiet tone of the film.He plays well with the tools he has written for himself and also includes nice 'fake builds' with the music and plays with our expectations to good effect. The lack of gore is a good thing and, as Japan continues to show us, sometimes unsettling juxtapositioning images can be even more effective without just sudden gore etc. I was effectively creeped out by the whole thing. Kidman is very well cast and she plays very well indeed  bring the sense of fear to the screen and encouraging the audience to feel the same as her. The child actors avoid being too cute and cloying and are part of making the film rather chilling. Support is very good from Flanagan and Sykes, but you do have to wonder why Eccleston bothered in a role that is pointless for the vast majority of the film.Overall this is an enjoyable film that is quite chilling and is basically just a simple ghost story. There are no major scares and none of it will take you by surprise even if you don't see things coming but it does what it does well and without fuss. Some viewers will have issues with elements of it  and rightly so, but generally it is a very effective little film that you will enjoy the less you know about it.",Null,6,11,13 January 2005
Troy," If all you want is spectacle then this will just about do you  but it is dull, emotionless spectacle
","King Agamemnon sweeps across the land with his mighty army and his supposedly invincible warrior Achilles at the front. Meanwhile one his subject is brokering peace with the princes of Troy  Hector and Paris. When Paris steals the beautiful Helen from Menelas and takes her to Troy it sparks a battle and gives Agamemnon the chance to seize Troy. Inside the city walls of Troy the defences are build and the walls relied on to withstand the attack as they have so often, while on the beaches the mighty army of Agamemnon land and prepare for a long and bloody battle.Let us not forget that this film is a summer blockbuster and, as such, the important thing is spectacle and noisy effects rather than anything else  it's a sad fact but it is a fact. If this is what you want from the film then it has plenty of action, plenty of big bronzed men with swords, heroic deaths and big set pieces. If this is all you want then you are very easy to please and I salute you for that  I wanted more than just action and unfortunately I found Troy to be devoid of anything else of value. In terms of action and effects it all looks good and is technically impressive but the problem with the action, nay the whole film, is that it has zero emotional involvement to draw you in. I could barely care less who lives or dies, who wins or loses because these were not people  they were just big, larger than life blocks  the gods may have been removed from the story but they have been replaced by Petersen who views these characters as his playthings instead!I won't get into petty squabbles over the changes to the source material (I'm reviewing the film in itself) but it did seem to me that the loss of the gods is part of the problem. With the gods' meddling, all the fighting is their fault and we would have felt for the characters  they had no choice. Without the gods the whole war is silly and pointless, based on the silly crush of a boy on a woman who is known for her beauty more than her character (a beauty that will fade). For this reason I never felt for any of them because I wasn't sure who I was rooting for  I was against them all and only wanted it all to be over. But hang on Bob  aren't you missing the point? Well, maybe. I thought that myself  this is a sort of anti-war film after all so maybe the pointlessness of the whole affair is the message the film is delivering? Maybe, but I doubt it. The film tries to be anti-war by having several speeches about the futility of it all and how it never ends but then at the same time it revels in the battle scenes, the heroic deaths, the honour of the men and the roar of battle. It wants to have it's cake and eat it too but in the end all it does is undermine itself in both regards. The situation is silly and pointless and the film knows it  indeed it tries to move way from the battle for Helen as quickly as it can and make it a bigger thing  but it fails, the foundation is weak and never engaged me and attempts to draw me in later were poor. All the story manages to do is to slow the film way down between the battles  it gets the point where I found the film painfully dull and it all was full of it's own self-importance without having anything to actually back up this claim.The cast is deep in names and faces but very few actually have anything to do  like I said, these are not characters; just blocks to be moved like toy soldiers. Pitt is, well, Brad Pitt. He is very sexy, he looks pretty, he moves well and his body is well sculpted: if that is all you want then that is what he delivers. What he doesn't do is deliver a character or a performance. He plays his hero like an arrogant, petulant child and his woeful attempts to give him a personality or emotion in the final stages of the film are just that  woeful. As a blockbuster star he is OK and does what he normally does, but let us never think for a minute that he is an actor. Bloom shows the same acting ability that he did in LOTR, ie none. He is weedy and needy as a character and it needed a talented actor to deliver this, Bloom can't do it. Bana is a good actor (see Chopper) and he has a good presence here even if his material is weak  for my money he was the star of the film and he outshone Pitt. Kruger is beautiful no doubt but she brings nothing else to the table. Cox is good because he not only seems to be enjoying himself but also is sending the whole film up! He is not a kingly king, he is a modern one and his performance comes close to taking the p*ss. The rest of the cast features a large number of faces that add class even if they have no material to really do anything with  Gleeson, Bean, O'Toole and the ever-reliable James Cosmo.Overall this film looks great and will provide spectacle if that's all you want  but be warned that it cannot sustain it's running time and it gets very dull between all the noisy effect shots. The story is dull and lacking in any sort of emotional involvement  a fact that makes it duller and takes away from the impact of the action scenes. This is expensive and a big noisy film but it is so deeply flawed and pointless that I found it hard to get through. I'll leave others to debate the issues over the source material, all I cared about was if it was an enjoyable summer film or not  it isn't.",Null,13,26,28 May 2004
Dead Poets Society," Sappy but well acted  not my thing but I can see why some love it to death
","In an exclusive prep school in the 1950's, the focus is on grades and learning as sons follow their fathers' footsteps into the family profession.However, for a group of friends this changes when a new English teacher starts. As Mr Keating teaches them to express themselves and free their souls, the boys form a club for the reading of poetry and the discovery of beauty. However against an uptight background, tensions are formed and the boys learn more than they had expected.With my mother wishing to watch this film, I decided to stick around and give it a try as well, even though I had seen it before when it had come out. True to my memory the film is a quite sentimental coming of age story that does pretty much what you expect but feels quite classy. The story isn't overly moving but some scenes pull on the heart, albeit in a rather cynical 'swelling music' way. However, it does work even if I don't think the Oscar praise was totally deserving  if pushed I would say it was one of the better 'coming of age' things I'd seen recently.The cast are all pretty good and have mostly become more famous with time. Williams is his usual sappy self but tones it down a little here. Considering that his role is really just a supporting one, a catalyst for the boys' story, Williams manages to make a big impression with key scenes. I'm not a big fan of his but he gives a well-delivered performance here. Leonard and Hawke are both pretty strong even if it is hard to see them as young boys now  I can't help but see them as they are now. Support is good from Smith, Charles, Hansen etc but really the film belongs to Hawke and Leonard unless Williams is swinging in to steal his individual scenes from them.Very much a mothers' film this one  if you like the weepy, sentimental genre then you should love this. To be honest it is not really my cup of tea but I did quite enjoy it and felt the writing was pretty good  just a shame that it is never more than a crying boy away from slipping into bonding and sentimentality. A little syrupy and will put off those who dislike such things but fans of the genre will love it and will leave it buoyed up by the message of 'carpe diem'.",Null,9,18,11 July 2004
Brokeback Mountain," A bit too slow perhaps but engaging, beautifully filmed, well acted and touching in a low-key and repressed way
","1963. Two men meet for the first time as they enter the employment of Joe Aguirre to tend his flock of sheep as they graze over the coming months. Although forestry rules establish set camps across the land, Aguirre wants his flocks guarded against predators day and night so, while Ennis tends camp and prepares meals etc, Jack stays high on the mountain with the flock, returning only for meals. Few words are exchanged between the two as the weeks go by. Despite this though they develop an easy chemistry and, one night when they have both had too much whisky to go back to the flock, they share a bed together for warmth. One night of rough fumbling and spit-lubricated sex later and they wake the next morning with assurances of it being a 'one shot deal'. However, the first time done, it becomes easier to do it again and the pair become lovers. The season ends early due to impending storms and the two split with barely a word; Ennis to his marriage and Jack back to his rodeo riding. However the events on the mountain stay with them both.Perhaps it says more about me than anything else, but when I heard a year or so back that someone was making a 'gay western' I assumed that it would be a horrid attempt at camp comedy. As to why Ang Lee was doing it seemed beyond me (although he had done Hulk so anything seemed possible). However watching it I quickly caught on that this story is not beyond him at all and is in fact an area he has touched on in several of his films thus far  repression, desire and hidden longing from people trying to be one thing in public and another behind tightly closed doors. The film opens with barely a word and continues in the same vein, although it engaged me with this approach from start to finish, I must admit that I felt the story was a little slower than it needed to be and was being a bit self-indulgent with all its pauses and silences. However the viewers mostly likely to be put off by the requirement of patience are most likely to the same ones already put off by the subject matter.The story is simple and exists in the hearts of the two men. The film is enjoyable as it builds to the sex and, although unconvincing in 'how' and 'why' it happens, it gets passed it well and before long it has become more about the feelings than the sex. This makes the film last because it makes it work regardless of sexuality and regardless of the audience's view of homosexuality. Essentially it comes down to the effect on the two men of living a form of lie and this makes the second half of the film as engaging as it is heart breaking to watch. Again, going slower than it needs to (but still covering a couple of decades in about 80 minutes) the film shows Ennis and Jack trying to fill the gap left by the other but still finding nothing better than one another, despite the risks. There are no dramatic falls or even that many high-volume confrontations but it does just show the pain inside them really well and Ang Lee allows the actors the space and the wide frames to work within to show it.Ledger is excellent and dominates the film with a quiet pain that is tangible. Working with mumbles and few expressions of emotion, he shows so much with his eyes and his body language that it makes his character very easy to feel for. The times where the emotion does spill out is just as convincing and compelling. Gyllenhaal weirdly has a showier role but is less interesting. His story is less interesting and his more animated performance doesn't set as well as Ledger's does with Lee's direction and the restrained tone of the film. The two have a good chemistry together and have both done well to keep their relationship natural and easy to care about. Support is generally very good despite having a few famous faces in roles so small that I wondering if some of their material had been cut out (Quaid for example). Williams is very good, initially confused but gradually angry and hurt at being cut off; like Ledger she does a lot without saying much. Mara's performance suggests that should Julia Roberts ever break, we have a replacement already tested and ready to go. Lee's direction very much suits the material and he uses the washed out landscapes to give the film a cold feel that compliments the performances and contrasts nicely with the moments of passion and emotion experienced on the mountainside.This won't be to everyone's tastes and many audiences will not even try to get past the 'gay western' badge; likewise even some watching it might struggle with the glacial pace it consistently has. However the story and the pace is in the characters and they (and their relationship) are drawn out in painfully real terms. The performances are strong and, considering the pin-up credentials of both men, brave. Lee's direction is slow but the result is a story that is engaging, painful and quite touching despite the fact that everything is delivered in a very muted and low-key way.",Null,26,33,6 February 2006
Ed Wood," If you didn't laugh about it you'd cry - so Burton wisely takes the route of weirdly dark comedy
","Ed Wood is a frustrated actor and director who's small theatre productions barely can get a good word said about them.  When a cheap little production company advertises a project about sex change, Wood jumps at the chance and uses his personal fetish for women's clothing as the hook to get the job. Despite his final project being laughed out of the major studios, Wood now has the taste for it and starts to try and get funding to make his own films - aided by the ailing star Bela Lugosi who is desperate for work to help fund his habits.  With a collection of freaks and oddballs, Wood made what are now considered to be some of the worst films ever made.Some things in life are depressing and it is often the case that we try to look on the bright side and make jokes about the situation as an attempt to deal with it.  I'm from Northern Ireland and my humour is quite dark and gallows style simply because that is the kind of comedy I grew up with was draw from the background of murder and violence - gallows humour is an appropriate term.  This film may not be based on gallows humour but it is such a potentially depressing story that the only way to do it and make it enjoyable is to tell it with humour.  Burton treats his subject with a great deal of affection and thus makes this film a funny tale of a dreamer who we know will never see his dreams fulfilled in the way he would like.  The story is funny but not in the cruel mocking way that it could have been but in a fanciful way that is amusing and all the better for being based on truth.  This strand continues all the way through the film and helps us to like Wood even if it is impossible to defend his films - the ending is perfectly upbeat considering that Wood then ended his life an alcoholic making cheap nude pictures.  The characters are exaggerated but still quite true to the real life people they represent (I take this from comments made in documentaries).As director, Burton is excellent.  He gives the whole film an otherworldly feel that is very fitting for a tale that involves characters that are very weird indeed.  The affectionate approach that Burton has for Wood really helps - I wonder does he relate to the guy just trying to make the films that appeal to him or what it is that makes him feel this way towards him? Either way the end result is very good and it stands out as a film that is pretty much without flaw.  I questioned the film's inclusion in the imdb top 250 but then I thought well, what is wrong with it? I had to admit that almost nothing is wrong - the only thing would be that the story may not be to everyone's tastes and not everyone will buy into Burton's affectionate look at Wood.The cast is led by a magnificent performance by Depp who I have long maintained is one of the finest actors (or at least bravest) of my generation.  Here he continues Burton's affectionate approach by portraying Wood as a man filled with hope and dreams - even doing a good job of turning cross dressing into an amusing quirk.  The cast is truly all star but they all do a great job playing their characters.  Landau's Oscar may have had a touch of sentimentality about it but it was still deserved - he plays Lugosi really well and manages the difficulties of his drug addiction really well to make him both amusing but deeply sympathetic.  The support cast includes good turns from Parker, Arquette (quite interchangeable really!), Jones, Murray, Starr, D'Onofrio and Spradlin.  All the cast do well but it is those that play Wood's wooden cast members that do the best job - managing to do both natural performances outside of Wood's movie but also doing justice to just how bad their characters really were!Overall this is a great movie but the tale of a rubbish movie director who enjoys cross-dressing and hangs out with a group of weirdoes is likely not to be to everyone's taste.  Regardless of this, if it interests you then you should be pleased with a slick movie that takes an amusing and affectionate look at what is a fairly depressing story.",Null,9,11,18 April 2004
Chicken Run," Not as funny as you'd want for adults but very enjoyable
","In England a chicken farm appears normal on the outside but inside is a different story.  Inside the chickens plan for escape, led by the fearless Ginger.  However despite her best efforts she is continuously caught by the farmer.  This changes when an American rooster flies into the compound and Ginger realises that he can teach them to fly out of the farm.From the makers of Wallace and Gromit came this first feature which I was greatly looking forward to.  W&G manage to be imaginative and hilarious without resorting to smutty humour to please the adults, they really did transcend ages.  Chicken run takes the same approach but expands to 80 minutes or so.  The plot is very clever  imagine The Great Escape set on a poultry farm and you've got it.  The film isn't afraid to show the dark side of this life and it is quite obvious considering it's a kids film.  It's moves nicely along with the energy covering the plot sagging a bit in the middle, however in terms of humour it is a little of a let down.The jokes are mostly very good, whether it be funny movie references or the chickens falling around or being silly.  However at 80 minutes the stretch marks do so and it isn't as consistent as I'd hoped it would be.  That's not to say it's not funny (it is!) but minute for minute it doesn't match other Ardman films.  The movie references are all good  from the Colditz Story, The Great Escape, Indiana Jones and a wonderful Braveheart joke that heralds Rocky's arrival.The cast are good and really bring life to the animals.  Sawalha is well cast as Ginger and Horrocks brings a lot of laughs as Babs.  Gibson is pretty good as Rocky and sends himself up well despite wandering off in the middle for a bit.  Daniels and Spall are good rats but I felt their jokes were weak and more could have been done with their characters.  Richardson and Haygarth both hold well as the Tweedy's.Overall this isn't as hilarious as I'd hoped but it was still very funny indeed.  It is stronger for not being afraid to show it's dark side a little and the movie references only help to hold adult interest when the humour does slightly drop.",Null,1,2,5 October 2002
About Time," Not funny or smart enough to justify the sheer amount of sentiment it pours on
","When he turns 21, young Tim has 'the talk' with his father – although in the case of his family, the father/son talk is actually to reveal that all the men in the family can travel in time, back to any moment in their own life. Told of the downsides of just chasing money or just never working, Tim continues his life but determined to make the most of his talent to try and make sure he has true love. It doesn't work out great at first but a chance meeting with Mary starts a journey of a lifetime.There is a message at the end of this film that is essentially about living life as it comes and enjoying it for what it is – not necessarily everyone quitting to go and travel for the rest of their life (someone needs to work) but just enjoying the ride whatever that ride is. It is a commendable message but the irony of it is that it is being delivered to someone who has just not done that for the previous 2 hours. Of course going into the film I knew that this is a Richard Curtis rom-com, filled with the usual faces and of course doing the usual things, so there is an element of buyer beware, but I was curious about the time-travel angle.Truth is that, outside of some plot points and basically the same jokes done over and over again, it really doesn't add much to what is essentially a film so sugary it will give you diabetes. The shame of it is that it does have nice ideas and themes in here but it never misses a chance to overdo it. So the soundtrack is full of easy Coldplay-esque rubbish, the narrator explains it all slowly so that the film doesn't need to be work, the relationships are all soft and cuddly, the characters are all totally fantasy people who only exist in Curtis' films and generally the whole thing is overdone and hugely sentimental. I would lie if I said that it didn't still work as such, but it really was hard work to stay close to it considering how much it pushed me away.The cast match the tone of the film and I found Gleeson and McAdams to be overly cutesy and cuddly – not a rough edge on either of their characters or their performances. Nighy at least adds a bit of clout to the mostly empty emotion, while Hollander, Grant, Griffiths and a few others at least add a bit of grit or cleverness into the film. Mostly though the whole thing is so safe and smoothed that almost no character remains in it. Of course it is not awful – it is too professionally crafted for that, but what it is just didn't work for me. About Time taught me a lesson about time – that it shouldn't be used for films that I don't fancy much but might watch just because someone said it is 'alright'.",Null,9,19,11 June 2014
The Hustler," A good film but a disinteresting and lack-lustre middle section stops it being a great one
","'Fast' Eddie Felson is a pool hustler who is small-time despite his attitude and mouth. His attitude leads him to challenge the mighty Minnesota Fats to a game of pool, a game that lasts for over 24 hours and leaves Eddie broken and broke. Eddie dumps his manager and goes back to working small poolrooms for small change, hooking up with an alcoholic girlfriend who he met in a bus station and settling into life on the bottom.Widely regarded as a classic, it has been a few years since I last saw this film (well  almost a decade) so I decided to rewatch it in order to be able to review it properly rather than just writing off from memory. The film opens well with the scenes that are the strongest of the film  the hustling scenes in the poolrooms. However once the film gets past Eddie's emasculation by Minnesota Fats it enters into it's middle section where we watch Eddie slowly hit rock bottom before starting to try and get up again. It is this section that takes up most of the running time and it is this section that contains many of the film's weaknesses. As Eddie falls deeper, the film trades in its atmospheric style for something more akin to social realism. Given that this is the gut of the film it is a major problem that it really fails to engage to the same degree that the other parts do. It feels a little dated and obvious and, although it still works, it is not effective enough drama to be worthy of it's place on so many critics' top whatever list.However the real drama works well in the pool scenes and the related bits, these are delivered with style, good dialogue and atmosphere to boot. The characters spark off each other here and at times you can feel the silence in the room as if you were there  like Eddie himself says, silent like a church. It is in these scenes where Eddie changes both times and it is therefore here that the drama works best. Of course we needed the middle section to deliver a story and give us Eddie's whole tale as opposed to some cool and stylish pool (like Scorsese mostly did) but it is overlong (it didn't need to be literally a long night of the soul!).The cast perform well and really help the film. Newman is very good even if you can see that he knows this is a good role for him  the odd time you could see he was showboating a little but he mostly kept his performance accessible and under control. Laurie has less to work with and is merely a driver for Eddie's actions at the end and a comfort for him in their shared destruction; her performance is OK but she is left to carry the weight of the film's middle section. Scott is good despite only being in part of the film while Gleason and Hamilton are both fine in small roles.Overall I felt pressure to really love this film because it is a classic and so highly regarded by the majority of critics. While I did love parts of it and liked it on the whole, I didn't think the main middle section was really that good  it got itself bogged down and delivered too little over too long a time. It still works sort of but it isn't good enough as a story to be worthy of such high praise as it is often given. The pool scenes are really well done and it is here where we see just how stylish, gripping and interesting the film can be as the characters really spark off each other with a palatable tension but sadly, for me, these scenes only served to show up the middle sections failings all the more. A good film but for my money not a great one.",Null,17,34,10 June 2004
Spotlight," Engagingly told story of process, with a strong emotional core
","By coincidence I watched this film only a week after listening to the editor in chief of Huffington Post UK say that authentic writing cannot come from paid journalists, which is why they do not pay their writers (although Adriana Huffington seemed fine with the millions she got when she sold the website). This stuck in my mind when watching this very fine drama about how the Boston Globe reporters uncovered and exposed a mass cover-up of abuse within the Catholic Church. Also in my mind was a sense of disbelief that this true story is not too much more than a decade old – the mass abuse of children by Catholic Priests now just seems such a known thing now that it is hard to imagine a time when it wasn't.Perhaps because this is so well known, the film is compelling because it focuses on the story of the story, focusing on the journalism. This gives the film the challenge that in terms of action it is mostly people typing, people on the phone, and lots of talking. This it manages really well, building a compelling but robust drama that builds well and takes the viewer along with it. The subject matter means that the emotional side is not left behind either, and the film deftly reminds us of the people (not just the facts) in ways that are natural and integrated, not sentimental or manipulative.McCarthy directs with professional control, and standards are high – mostly noticeably in the casting. It is not easy to point out one lead, because so many famous faces are here, and all of them do their job in a way that integrates with the rest – there are no really showing moments, no moments where you feel someone is pushing for an Oscar; it is a real ensemble piece, with too many good turns to start to name them all. The end result is that strong writing, and respect for the process of journalism, combines with the importance of the true story and the strong delivery of all aspects to produce an engaging story which carries emotional and professional weight.",Null,3,4,6 March 2016
Terminator Salvation," A solid blockbuster but no more than that
","I wasn't too fussed about seeing this film when it came out initially. It just struck me as yet another big noisy action movie and, while that kind of comes with the time of year, I just wasn't really in the mood for it and the average reviews didn't help. A cheap matinée changed my mind in regards watching it but what I found was more or less what I had been led to expect. The film offers much, this is the first time in the franchise that the action occurs during the reign of Skynet – previously we have only had clips of the future. Like most people this is one thing that I was looking forward to seeing and it is one of the ways that I think the film first sort of fudges things.Instead of the depressing bleak survival that we knew of from the first film, here the future seems a lot more organised and, well, militarised. I'm not really going to get into the logic or lack of logic in the plot but it doesn't feel like mankind is on the ropes or is on the run – indeed at times you wonder how Skynet can miss this much activity going on. Anyway this isn't really much of a problem because it does allow for more in the way of action and explosions. In this regard the film does deliver to a point, because it is noisy, have good pace and has plenty going on. This is not enough though because I rarely cared about the characters or felt an urgency to the events on screen. It is hard to describe but the film didn't get my pulse going or thrill me – instead it was just distracting for what it was but nothing more than that.This is caused by the characters being lost in the middle of all this plot and action. We have some good actors in there but nobody manages to do much. Some have complained that the film lacks the fun of some of the other films but I can understand this given the setting for the fourth film and the substance of the film being about the nature of being human etc. However, if this is the excuse then the film should have been much more engaging than it was but what it actually does is wear the seriousness like a cloak without really doing much with it. Bale uses his deep voice and troubled look but he has nothing of interest to do with his very interesting character other than look troubled and be gruff. Worthington is better because he has a more interesting character, again the material could have done more with him but he does well with what he has. Bloodgood is cute, Yelchin looks like who he is meant to be, Carter distracts by being overly famous for her role, Ironside is solid, Common fails to make up for Universal Mind Control with his film and Jadagrace is just the unwelcome 'cute kid' even if she does it well. The effects are the biggest part of the film and generally it does all look very good and move very well, again adding to the film being 'solid'.And that is what it is – solid. Not spectacular, not thrilling, not engaging, not a great film and not a particularly good addition to the franchise. It is not a bad film by any means and it worked reasonably well as a noisy blockbuster but generally it has too little going on behind the noise and doesn't justify the serious tone that it has. Take a look but don't expect too much.",Null,4,7,9 December 2009
Insomnia," Solid thriller with strong acting
","Glad to be getting away from the Internal Affairs investigation in their department in LA, Will Dormer and his partner Hap Eckhart fly up to assist on a murder case in Alaska.  Will quickly makes the progress that his reputation led young officer Ellie Burr to expect.  However when a suspect is chased through fog, Will accidentally shoots Hap.  He covers it up and blames the suspect, conscious that IAD will assume that he killed Hap to prevent him cutting a deal with them.  However later he gets a call from the killer who saw the whole thing and is holding it over Will in return for him framing someone else.   With fewer options and Ellie investigating the shooting, Will finds himself unable to sleep in the 24 hour sunshine and getting increasingly strung out.Better known as part 2 of Robin Williams proving he can do more than just sentimental crap, I was looking forward to seeing it.  I haven't seen the original film so I can't contrast the two and say which is better - I could only judge this on its own merits.  I found the film to be a very enjoyable thriller that was very atmospheric.  The story itself is quite intriguing and is at its best when Will and Walter are playing cat and mouse games with each other.  The main investigation and the investigation into Hap's shooting all add to the intensity.Although it is quite slow at times it is actually well paced - some fast paced exciting moments but mostly dialogue driven scenes that are just as exciting.  The direction is excellent and the whole film has a bright crisp feel to it.  The final shot of the film is powerful yet still, with the protagonists frozen against a background of lake and mountains.The film's main driver is the strength of the performances.  Williams is excellent, I was never sure what to make of his character because Williams kept him complex enough to hold the interest.  Pacino is also great.  He actually looks dog tired progressively through the film.  Like Williams, his character has enough meat on it to be of interest and when either of them was on the screen, my interest was guaranteed .  Swank had a difficult task to play opposite Pacino in the majority of her scenes but she really holds her own.  Donovan is good but brief, but to be honest it is Pacino and Williams' film the whole way.Overall this is a classy little thriller that has more than enough going on to keep it interesting.  The plot is well written so that it avoids a simplistic good/evil approach and the performances bring the well-drawn characters to life.",Null,14,22,4 April 2003
My Neighbor Totoro," Very cute and colourful but the material is surprisingly childish and not as impacting as I had wanted it to be
","With their mother ill in hospital, Satsuki and Mei's father moves them to a new country house. The two girls are excited to find that their house is 'haunted' and has soot gremlins running wild. Bundles of energy themselves, Satsukie and Mei love the space and the large forest all around them. While her father works and the older Satsuki goes to school, young Mei finds herself in the care of her neighbour 'Granny'. However going wandering alone in the grass, Mei finds another neighbour walking by  a small little spirit creature that live in the woods, just one of three 'Totoro's' that she befriends.Having seen screenshots of this film and seeing how cool the Totoro's were I was looking forward to this film. I'd love to be a film snob and pretend that I have known Miyazaki for years, the truth is I have not and know him thanks to the success of Spirited Away. I mention this because I was hoping for the emotional depth in this film that I had with SA and this was another reason I was looking forward to the film. Sadly it was not to be all I had hoped it would have been and, although his films are generally 'critic-proof', it was hard not to be a bit disappointed with it. Part of the reason was that it was a lot more childish than I expected it to be and it took a long time to really get going and, once it did, it was over. Although the Totoro's are the selling point, the film is really about the humans and how the girls deal with their reality. Perhaps it was the Disney version I saw, but I felt this was badly done and the emotions weren't well developed  rather they came out only in certain scenes and seemed artificial and were unengaging as a result.Visually the film is professional and polished in the 'human' scenes but Miyazaki's imagination and style comes out with the Totoro's (which are very cool) and the cat bus (which is weirdly cool). As characters they are both very much side issues though. This is a bit annoying because of how cool they are, but it is actually distracting because of how underdeveloped the main material is. For children I imagine it will be great fun as they will love the girls and the creatures and won't find the story too simplistic. Adults will also love the charm of the creatures but many will struggle with the story that seems to be focusing on the emotions of the family but somehow fails to do it that well. Adults might also find the girls tiring as they are unbelievably cute balls of energy; personally I thought they were fun but I think they would wear me out totally if they were mine! In the Disney version the Fanning sisters do a pretty good job with the voice work. I cannot be sure if the failure of the material is Disney's fault or not but the Fannings do what they can. They are polished and cute but they cannot get consistent emotion in their characters and, when they do, it seems artificially condensed as if the writer had suddenly remembered that his characters had these worries and fears in their little hearts. The Totoros are very cute and quite funny but they are not emotional characters and I was a bit frustrated by them not contributing more to the experience than just being cool.Overall this is cute, cool and quite fun but those looking for it to even get close to the emotion and depth of Spirited Away will be disappointed. It seems to forget the heart of the story and is all too keen to just frolic with the Totoro before rushing the emotion in an unsatisfying conclusion. Fun, colourful and good for children but, aside from some moments of magic and cool creatures, many adults won't find the material to be strong enough to fully engage with.",Null,2,7,3 September 2006
Juno," Walks a fine line between being clever and smug but mostly is smart, funny and touching with more to it than just superficial quirkiness
","Juno is a sassy but geeky teen who is 'sexually active' at age sixteen. When she gets pregnant with friend Bleeker, she decides to have an abortion but somehow the clinic just doesn't feel right and she goes for the adoption route instead. With 'perfect' couple Mark and Vanessa Loring set up, the father kept secret and Juno's family supportive, it is only a matter of the seven or eight months between now and then to go.Juno had me a bit worried and I wasn't really planning to see it. Indie-spirited and described as 'this year's etc etc' I didn't feel sure that it was being praised because it was good or praised because it was just a bit different and quirky. It took me about twenty minutes to get an answer to that because, although very cool, the opening credits and soundtrack selection do scream 'quirky' and 'kooky' as if it was having a sale of those qualities. Indeed this does continue across the whole film as the dialogue is smart and rapid, the characters 'off-beat' and the music slight and quirky. With this sort of material it is very easy to fall into the trap of just getting by on being cool and quirky and other similar films have done so. Fortunately Juno just about makes it work even though it walks a very fine line at times.For this director Reitman owes writer Cody a drink because the script produces great characters and interesting scenarios across the ensemble approach. Ultimately it will feel too insubstantial and quirky for some viewers but for me I was impressed by the way it drew out the various characters and twisted things to be more downbeat and realistic rather than the upbeat, sassy stuff that makes up the majority of it. Not that there is anything wrong with this though, because it was the quirky touch that got me into the film. In this area Reitman pulls it all together really well and, aside from the cosmetic touches, brings out good performances from his cast. Page dominates the film and seems to find sassy Juno effortless; however she is also good in the harder, more emotional moments  my favourite being in the basement scene where she betrays her fragility. Cera is currently hot so makes the poster but really his role is small and mainly relies on him looking funny in shorts (which he does). His Arrested Development father Bateman is good and I liked how he held his character constant while allowing circumstances to totally change the perception of the audience. Garner does the same but in the opposite direction and her damaged, stressed character is convincing and real. Janney and Simmons are both strong in smaller roles on the 'quirky' side of the material while the rest of the cast tend to be well observed minor characters (eg Su-Chin, Vijay, Bleeker's mum) that continue the quirky independent feel.Overall then, Juno does walk a fine line and I totally understand why some viewers will find it unbearably smug and full of its own cleverness but for me it actually has enough going on within itself to avoid being just a load of quirky characters, songs and dialogue. Page is great in the title character and the ensemble cast all turn in good performances while the script gives everyone plenty to work with. Not the second coming that some proclaim it as but certainly not the superficial quick-fest that others say it is  the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is very enjoyable and effective while performing this balancing act.",Null,6,15,17 February 2008
L.A. Confidential," Simply a wonderful film that respects it's audience
","In the gritty LA of the 1950's, stardom is the boom industry and all is about appearance and visual image.  However under the surface drug use is rife, prostitution is rampant and the police officers are violent thugs.  In the middle of this are three officers with different aims.  Ed Exley is an ambitious young officer who will do anything to climb the ranks, Bud White is a muscle man and gets the job done while Jack Vincennes is only concerned with celebrity busts and getting his face in the paper.  When the three come together on a coffee shop killing that brings in elements of cases they are following they solve it together.  However each has suspicions that something is not right.I'm sorry to say that I didn't pick up on this at the cinema and it wasn't until the Oscars brought it to my attention that I first saw it.  Since then I have seen it several times and have enjoyed it every time.  The plot is slightly complex (although maybe not by the genre's standards) and it isn't simplified for the audiences sake  it respects the audience enough to trust us to keep up with it's pace.  The film is split into three strands dictated by the characters, they are not quite distinct but are mostly intertwined the whole way through  coming together in the final hour to great effect.The pace of the telling is great; it has moments of drama, of tension and great action.  Hanson has done a great job with the direction, he has a great sense of place and time to his 50's Hollywood  whether it be the stars' lives or the black suburbs  but he directs each scene with a sense of tension and urgency that the material deserves.  The final twist is OK if not great but it is more the telling of the story that is enjoyable, not just the denouncement.The casting did a great job of getting growth names and established qualities but no one huge star who could dominate the film.  It is the Australian stars that stand out here.  Pearce is excellent with a subtly changing character but it is Crowe that sticks in the memory with a very strong character and a performance to match.  Spacey is as quality as he ever is (or at least, was for a few years either side of this film) and the support cast is as good with De Vito, Basinger, Cromwell, Rifkin, Strathairn and Guilfoyle.There is nothing I really dislike about this film.  The longer than average running time is not a problem as it easily fills it without dragging at any point.  The film oozes class and has a great tough plot from Ellroy where nothing is as simple as right/wrong and everything comes together at the end.  A real classy film with brains and brawn which continues to be one of my favourites of recent years.",Null,18,25,23 November 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Clichéd, illogical, unscientific but the first hour really delivers even if the second hour is like the 1970's never happened
","After years of warning about global warning, Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.This film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.The clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.The script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.Overall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.",Null,292,426,31 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Forgets to be fun and is overly serious, plodding, dull and weakly acted while Depp is sidelined for reasons best known to the makers (spoilers)
","There are some films where I must concede that maybe I'm just not getting it and am not seeing what everyone else in the world is seeing because with this third and final film in the Pirates series, I find myself reading the reviews and looking at the ratings and juts shaking my head. Did everyone else sit in the same film as myself? From my point of view I might as well repost my review of the first sequel because all the same problems are there (which I suppose means if you like that you'll like this). The first film surprised me by just being good old fashioned fun carried almost wholly on the back on a wonderfully risky performance from Depp that rightly earned him an Oscar nod.However that key part of the first film seems to have been forgotten in the sequels as 'fun' is very thin on the ground as the conclusion continues an 'epic' story that is built on characters I found hard to care for and a narrative that stutters where the original just flowed along with a wink and a grin. It is all to serious and full of ideas and threads that go nowhere. I found it endlessly frustrating that the film would ask me to follow the character connections only to have them go nowhere of value. The most laughable example of me was the building up of 'Calypso' only for her to turn into a load of crabs and produce a bit of a whirlpool that doesn't seem to bother too many people in the final battle scenes.With this story, Captain Jack (surely the only character anyone likes) is almost made a marginal character in his own film. Having been carried by Jack in the first film, the focus seems to have shifted to Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, both of whom resemble their own cardboard cut-outs you see in the multiplex lobbies. Their 'romance' is annoying and I found their battle-scene marriage to be hilarious (although I suspect this was not the intention). One or two scenes are amusing but mostly it is all too earnest and heavy and I found myself bored and caring less and less with every passing scene. The effects continue to be good but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should; ignoring this we end up with all sorts of silliness ending up with a dizzyingly daft series of fights as the camera spins all around the place.The cast is deep with familiar and famous faces and in theory they should benefit from having a script with so many interactions, betrayals etc. Of course the script does leave many of them hanging but the biggest failing for me was the way the film is put on the shoulders of the two people least able to carry it, namely Knightly and Bloom. In the first film it was obvious that they weren't really up to the task but they are left really exposed here and can't raise their game to the task. Depp is good as he was in the other films but he is very much sidelined and he only has a handful of moments where he gets the material to work with. The support cast are actually OK but they mostly drive the film to the more serious side. Nighy and Harris are handed bigger characters but left in the lurch by a script that was using them rather than utilising them. Davenport, Pryce, Skarsgård and others are all fine. Rush is a bit too hammy to fit in the newly serious film; some add some nice comic touches but a cameo from Keith Richards is a painfully pointless affair that is at least mercifully short.Overall then, another step away from what made the original film so good  fun. With little of that on offer I was left with an overly heavy plot, average performances, impressive but OTT special effects and performances that ranged from the serviceable (the majority) to the weak (Bloom and Knightly) while someone seems to have decided to barely use the best weapon in the arsenal and mostly sidelines Depp's wonderful Jack Sparrow. This was my first of the 2007 threequels and I hope they get better than this.",Null,10,16,31 May 2007
Deadpool 2," Pretty consistently entertaining despite a few bumps
","The first film did more than enough to make me look forward to the sequel, even if the film itself was not as good as the promotional work ahead of it. So it is again here, as very funny adverts and promos got me excited but at the same time meant that the film didn't quite deliver in the same way. To be fair, this is because it is a two-hour film, so not easy to do the same as a few minute spot or bit. This can be seen in a few bumps along the way of the film - plot points which need to be delivered but do take the film away from joking or doing action, which is really where it works best.Outside of these bumps though, the film gets the mood right, with irreverent humor and solid action sequences. It is pretty polished and professional, which does take away from its attempts to appear to have rough edges, but it works nonetheless. The comedy is broad and knowing; mostly this is at a level which is amusing but it does periodically have plenty of good laughs or clever moments. Likewise the action sequences are rarely thrilling, but they do have enough about them to inject energy and plenty of noise.All told, a pretty consistent and enjoyable film which steps up from the first film while still keeping what made it work.",Null,0,4,27 August 2018
X-Men," Dark comic book adaptation
","In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them 'mutants', the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly. The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto, and Professor Charles Xavier into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called 'X-Men' to stop him.  Two mutants with dangerous powers, Logan and Rogue arrive at Xavier's retreat seeking refuge.This is one of the few comic book adaptations that delivers fully.  Ignore the fact that this takes liberties with the comics by changing costumes and leaving out characters.  The changed costumes are better - darker colours making it feel more realistic rather than bright spandex, the missing characters maybe a disappointment but the film would have been too packed for any characters to come through.  The basic story is exciting and allows plenty of room for great set pieces.  The mood is perfect, Singer delivers a dark vision of the near future.The script is pretty clever, taking the US's natural reaction to mutants and putting it onscreen - this is a country that doesn't accept other nationalities readily, of course some senator would try to make political points out of hatred.  The fact that both Magneto and Xavier are both flipsides of the same coin, trying to deal with the same problem makes it very clever - not merely a bad guy and a good guy set-up.  The action scenes are the best though and are very stylishly done by Singer - it's clear he likes his  characters and their powers.The cast are roundly excellent.  Stewart and McKellen add great class in the two fatherly roles and both give good performances.  Hugh Jackman is the best of the rest, it was here that his star started rising.  In fairness it helps that he has the best character in the whole film in the dark, mysterious Wolverine.  Does anyone else think he looks like a young Clint Eastwood?  Paquin is good as are Janssen and Berry.  The bad guys are OK in terms of looks but they don't really have any character - they are merely henchmen.  Given the screen presence of Ray Park when he did his recent heavily made-up bad guy his Toad is a bit of a disappointment.Overall this dark comic book action movie is excellent for a blockbuster. It's main problem is that it is far too short and really leaves you wanting more.  Hopefully for X-men 2, Singer won't take the Batman route and lighten the mood to make `Happy Meal' merchandising deals easier.",Null,4,8,4 February 2002
Spider-Man 3," Average multiplex stuff at best with weak writing and a frantic overuse of effects (spoilers)
","Revenge is a powerful and rarely a good one. For Peter Parker it is clearly something to be avoided as it has turned his former friend into his most deadly enemy. However Peter himself finds himself sucked into the web of revenge and violence as it emerges that the man who police now believe killed his uncle has just escaped. A simple feat to bring him to justice? Perhaps, but Flinto Marko has also stumbled into some sort of experiment and has been transformed into the Sandman. While battling these two foes, Parker finds a use for a black, symbiotic substance that has attached itself to his Spiderman suit, giving him great power. But is the power from this alien source as innocent as Parker hopes?After seeing the third Pirates of the Caribbean films and being very disappointed and bored, I decided to keep my toe in the summer blockbuster pool (what choice do I have?) and see the third Spiderman film. Having been impressed by both of the other two Spiderman films I was quite disappointed to find an overly busy film that offered me very little apart from special effects. These were impressive as always but (as with Pirates) the ability to do so much on screen should not mean that so much has to be done. Sadly here the effects sequences are overly busy and frantic and it was hard to feel involved in the action or build a tension  in a way it was often little more than a swirling video game sequence.The knock on of the effects is that the whole film does feel quite superficial  something to be expected to a point from a summer multiplex filler but not something that should be embraced in the way it is here. The most glaring issue is the volume of characters in the film because this causes so many other problems. Flow-wise each of these characters has to be introduced and mostly this is done by handy coincidence and lazy writing; eg Venom hits Earth just as Parker is in the woods and doesn't jump him until he happens to be in his Spiderman suit, or how, guess what, now Marko killed your Uncle, or Eddie Brock happening to be in the church where Venom leaves Parker etc. One of these is forgivable but there are so many of them that it reveals the whole thing to be build on easy narrative devices that lack sense. The writing problems continue in the way that the theme of revenge is dealt with; it could have been a real strong base for the action but instead it is very superficial with no meat on the bones; the killer for me being when Harry forgave Peter simply because his butler said 'oh yeah, forgot to mention, your Dad died of his own wounds  sorry for not mentioning it sooner', at that point I nearly laughed out loud.The lack of meat in the script but an abundance of characters also means that it flows at a basic level and a lot of the fun is gone. There are still some funny moments and JJ is still a great side character but it doesn't have the buzz and energy of the other films. The cast struggle with this as well. Maguire works at the same level as the script and his inner turmoil is just as superficial and seems to be switched on or off in each scene. It doesn't help that his 'evil' look is that of a spotty emo in a mood with his parents but he can't find anything in himself to improve matters. Dunst and Franco are equally as basic and they act knowing that there are no 'real' people on their pages, just cardboard cutouts. Church is rubbish for the same reason and his final scene was as bad as he was. Grace was a weird find but his fall to revenge was too quick and easy and it robbed his end of any meaning. Simmons can do no wrong for me and produces one of the funniest scenes, although another one belongs to another Campbell cameo who is wonderfully 'French' in the background of one scene.Overall then it probably has just about noise and popcorn appeal to pack them in and indeed it has broken opening weekend records in the US but this does not indicate a good film, which this certainly is not. With too much going it the potential is wasted and the ideas and themes are sketched rather than detailed. This knocks through into everything else and produces little more than a video game with cut sequences. Not terrible by any means but a massive drop in quality compared to the previous two films.",Null,5,11,31 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," A little too polished, but very entertaining and fun
","This was the second Marvel film I watched this week (Homecoming being the other), and it reinforced what the franchise does well - which is to entertain. Not all the films achieve this, but Thor Ragnarok certainly does. It takes its lead very much from the stylish and retro fun of Guardians of the Galaxy, but it has an awkward humor that is very much its own. This is really its main selling point, as the film displays great comic timing throughout, with plenty of very good moments drawing good laughs and fun.At times the film feels a bit too engineered and designed. It is such a change from the previous Thor films (which didn't embrace this silliness quite as much) that it does stand out for its difference, but yet at the same time the accessible entertainment value makes it fit very well beside the more recent Marvel films, in particular the comedy tone of Guardians of the Galaxy. This carries it well, and it does own it surprisingly well; it helps that the cast all get it throughout, there is no feeling of everyone working in one direction while a different direction was trying to be found. The silly tone works, while not detracting from the general plot, which is a frame at best, but yet works.The times it tries to have weight don't really manage to stand up, but otherwise there is a lot to like in a film that is entertaining, slick, well timed, and with everyone aligned to what it is trying to do.",Null,1,4,24 March 2018
Match Point," Only a partial success but still interesting and engaging on the whole
","Chris Wilton is a former tennis pro, who was a regular on the circuit but never really good enough to get anywhere in the game. He retires into a coaching job at a club and meets the wealthy Tom Hewitt. Through him he meets Tom's sister Chloe and also Tom's American fiancé Nola. The latter he finds sexual exciting and dangerous while the former he finds 'nice' but available. With Eleanor by his side Tom finds opportunity and advantage entering his life and it is a matter of time before he marries her, while also starting an ill-judged affair with Nola.It is fashionable to moan about Woody Allen's output over the last few years and this is perhaps understandable but for me Match Point is a commendable, if not perfect, film from him that doesn't sit with his usual genre. There is no laughs to be had here, no character for Allen or even a character like Allen but it is similar in regards its exploration of love, lust and money. The setting in the English upper classes makes for a cold setting that suits the relationships, which are as much about position and breeding as about genuine love. In this regard the film is engaging as we not only have a love triangle plot but we have questions of what we would do, the power of those at the top, the desire to stay on top and the practicality of relationships. It is longer than his normal work but Allen has no problem filling it with material that I was surprised to find him wholly responsible for writing.It is not perfect of course and the very cold edge does mean that the fire of passion at the end might leave some viewers disbelieving. Likewise the speed with which it is all sown up might seem all a bit convenient to some, even if I felt it a fitter comment on the nature of power. The cast mostly work well with the material despite the fact that I personally don't care much for either of the leads. Meyers is suitably conflicted between lifestyle and love. I did feel his range was limited though and did think that someone better could easily have been cast. Likewise with Johansson, who is very playful and does pretty well with the later emotion but yet never made me shake the idea that she is here due to her fame not her talent. Mortimer is solid as is Goode, Cox and Wilton; although mentioning the last two leads me to mention that the film also contains minor turns from Kaye, Fortune, Salmon, Bremner and Nesbitt  none of whom are 'bad' but their presence was a distraction that the film could have done without and I have no idea why so many famous faces were cast in minor roles; Allen might as well as set off bangers and fireworks at each showing if he wanted to distract the audience that much!Anyway, despite this and the cold, slow pace, the film is engaging and interesting in its themes. In terms of story it doesn't totally work towards the end but up till then it is questioning and interesting. Not to everyone's taste and only a partial success but good to see Allen expanding himself and doing interesting work.",Null,2,3,30 March 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," Very basic genre film that puts the absolute minimum of effort put into character, story, atmosphere and impact
","The survivors of Racoon City have fled but the T-virus has moved quicker than anyone could have predicted and soon the entire world has fallen. Humans are not the only ones infected as all the creatures fall as well, destroying ecosystems and leaving little in their place. A small group of survivors travel across the Nevada desert, surviving one day at a time. This group is rescued by Alice, herself working on a plan to get to Alaska where isolation has supposedly protected an area form the T-virus  if only they can evade the infected to get there. This is not their only problem though, as the Umbrella Corporation is working on a treatment for the virus involving Alice's blood and, having located her, are setting out to capture her dead or alive.Approaching the Resident Evil series of films is a bit like living with an unreformed junkie, which is to say that, when you come home one day and all your stuff has gone then you are probably being naive if you're surprised. So with this third film I already had set my expectations pretty low because it is unfair to expect it to have changed since the other two films. Film three opens up the action into a world destroyed by the T-virus, with small groups of survivors fleeing Racoon City into the desert to live out a Mad Max style existence. It is also unfair to complain about this being 'unrealistic' but I'm going to do it anyway but I'm going to do it within the context of the film. You see most films are not 'real' situations but the important thing is to create a world that is convincing within the context of the story that you are telling  when you can't do that you leave the viewer on the outside from the very start.That is what happens here because the development of this world has gone no further than the pitch of 'the world is infected and small groups are surviving' and it never really rings true. OK, so this is the first problem but if the rest of it works then maybe this won't matter. The next thing is the actual plot which, as before, has the potential in the shadowy masters of the world (a corporation with their own interests at heart) and the dangers of the infected. Sadly the plot again does little with these other than create a simple little event-driven story that allows for lots of gore and running. Again though, playing devil's advocate, that will be what the majority of people have come to the film for  gore and running. But guess what? Yup, I got another problem here.You see for me this film should achieve a lot with very little because I am a really easy target. I get easily scared and gripped by the zombie genre due to my fear of their base desire and unrelenting drive to satisfy that desire  even the Nazi Zombie sub-game in COD5 makes my skin crawl. However with Resident Evil 3 I found myself sitting there totally apathetic throughout. The effects were nice and some of the scenes were well conceived even if they were a bit derivative (the crows has a clear inspiration but is still a good sequence). What is missing though is a sense of real danger, a reason to care about the characters and a genuine sense of horror and fear  not gore, but fear. Without these what we have are bloody action sequences that concentrate on just delivering gore to satisfy those who have come for that and that alone. As such the film does do OK and might work as a Friday night DVD for young men staying in with friends and beer.The cast fit into this because the majority of them know that their roles are just part of genre cliché. Please form an orderly cue: the ethnic tick-boxes, the sexy young women, the one who gets secretly infected, the power-crazed scientist, the sacrificial hero, the non-threatening teen and so on. Jovovich does her usual stuff and prevents herself looking bored even though she has little to work with. Fehr is a rugged and good looking 'hero'. Ashanti is stunning. Larter is feisty. Glen is thoughtfully nuts. Epps is 'comedy' relief and so on. It is not really an actor's film and it shows in their performances, which tick the genre boxes but nothing more.Resident Evil 3 is not much cop but it does rather depend on your point of view. If you are target audience and happy with the gore being the be all and end all of the film then it will probably do enough to satisfy. For the rest of us though the film is little more than a very basic genre film that ticks the boxes with the absolute minimum of effort put into character, story, atmosphere and impact.",Null,0,1,1 February 2009
Midnight in Paris," Can you forgive an old man his whimsy? If so then this is a good film, not a great film, but a fine piece of comedic fluff.
","It has been quite a few years now but still every new Woody Allen film is greeted with praise of 'return to form' just as surely as the next film will also be greeted the same way. Midnight in Paris is one such film although I wasn't so sure and although I like Woody Allen, I never got moved to actually watch it until recently. The film opens with a visual feast of Paris – which is a beautiful city but one I find too expensive and, contrary to this film, it is no fun at all when it is chucking down with rain. The opening shots are more than just to get you in the mood for a film that loves the place and the history, it tells you a lot about the film itself because this is a romantic fantasy where Allen loses himself into whimsy and lightness.The tone throughout is typical Allen, with the intellectual humor played out in the style you expect. I will not pretend to get all of the references but at least knew enough about the characters and their work to be able to keep up with it (ironically some of the people I know because of Allen's other work). It is never more than fluff though, so to enjoy it you do need to go with it and forgive the film for being what it is – if you are not in the mood for this then I think it will grate on you heavily. Personally I enjoyed it because of how light and easy to enjoy it was, but I did still need to forgive it its fantasy and muddled nature – the conclusion of the final few scenes sort of contradicts itself and is all too silly and romantic, but by that point you'll probably have warmed to it or switched it off.The cast buy into the whimsy pretty well. Wilson leads the cast well and his natural style actually fits the Allen-impression that every leading man ends up giving in one of his films. McAdams is really enjoyable next to him – again she fits that role that you see so often in Allen's films. Support is good from Cotillard (who really is a lovely presence as required by the character), Sheen, Hiddleson, Stoll, Brody, Bates and many others. Everyone has that light touch that fits so well with the tone and place of the film.Overall Midnight in Paris is not some wonderful return to form but it is a light and enjoyable piece of whimsy that fans of Allen will enjoy and forgive – but even they will need to have some forgiveness because it is fluffy and light. Those that dislike the man and his style will find a great deal to hate here but for me I liked it once I got into its tone and pace – it is as charming and as make-believe as the places our main characters jump to, but it works for what it is. A good film, not a great one unless you're in the mood, but it could be a fine comedy. And then Hemmingway punched me in the mouth.",Null,0,0,15 November 2013
Zodiac," Convincing crafted and engaging even if it does require patience from the viewer due to the nature of the material
","Several people have already been murdered by the time a series of letters are sent out to San Francisco newspapers from someone calling himself The Zodiac, claiming responsibility and providing details to prove it. Providing a series of ciphers with clues to his identity, Zodiac taunts the police with more letters and murders. On one paper introvert cartoonist Robert Graysmith and journalist Paul Avery start their own investigation, overlapping with police inspectors Toschi and Armstrong. Weeks become months become years and the periodic killings and letters continue while the investigations continues to be one inconclusive lead after another.It is understandable perhaps that this film did not do that well in the US because it is not an easy sell to audiences who are used to serial killer movies going a certain way most of the time. It probably didn't help that Se7en was mentioned in almost every review of Zodiac because the two are very different despite sharing the serial killer theme. Zodiac is not quite as good as Se7en although it is close, but the challenge is the way it is a good film because it is a much less obvious product. The story covers decades and lacks an ending that 'traditional' serial killer movies normally have  the difficulties in delivery are obvious and it is to the film's credit that it still manages to be interesting and engaging.The script is not perfect and I did think it could have more in the way of layering and less of some other things but the most impressive thing about it is how well it flows forward and hangs together. The captions vary from 'three hours later' to 'one year later' but even with the constant jumps in time, it still works well and never feels fragmented or like we're missing something in the jumps. The script develops the case well and manages to bring out a realistic feel that is refreshingly downbeat and different from other cop thrillers and in doing this it is engaging but, and I stress the but, it does require patience. It is slow and the strength is in the detail rather than a fast-paced, exciting thriller plot, which I found rewarding and interesting but I can also understand why many viewers turned away from it for the same reason. It doesn't feel like 160 minutes very often and there are only a few aspects that I felt could have been removed totally (Graysmith's wife is a character that could and should have been lost to 'artistic license').With a solid script in place a lot does rest on the delivery to make it more than an 'OK' story. Fincher's direction is as strong as one would expect. He matches the material with a realistic eye and when he does use special effects they are well done and befitting the tone of the film. He excels at some points, producing murders are truly horrific and haunting. He draws strong performances from almost the entire cast, although it is Gyllenhaal who tends to dominate the film with an assured performance that subtly builds from geeky fascination to one nearing obsession. He is well supported by a typically solid Ruffalo who nicely moves his character from a working detective to a man broken and tired by the whole thing. Edwards was a surprise find and was good support but, while I enjoyed his presence, I did think that Downey Jr pushed his performance a bit too hard as it clashed with the more downbeat characters played by the others. Sevingy is handed a difficult character and can't make it work within the film, even if there is nothing wrong with what she does. Koteas, Cox, Terry and others provide good minor turns while Lynch is quite chilling as one of the possible suspects.Overall then, an interesting and convincing account of the failed investigation into the Zodiac killer. The challenges are obvious but are mostly overcome thanks to a strong all-round delivery but it is worth noting that it will have no traditional climax and does require patience from the viewer.",Null,13,23,12 July 2007
Milk," Doesn't quite get into the man but does a great job or representing his importance and impact within a movement
","I finally got round to seeing Milk after the Oscars gave it a bit of a publicity boost by virtue of Penn and the writer winning awards. It was not that I hadn't wanted to see the film (I had) but just that the cinemas had suddenly been overwhelmed with 'award-worthy' films all trying to get publicity and eligibility at the same time. The film itself is best approached outside of all the hype and praise though, because it is not this perfect film that some would have you believe (although this is not to say that it is bad, just that all these films get talked-up far too much at this time of year).Milk covers a lot of ground and it is to its credit that it does it in a way that has a good narrative flow to it and mixes the professional and personal Milk into the tale. Where I think the film works best though is in the way it manages to capture a movement and a time. Having been to the Castro a few years ago, it is hard to imagine the world as it was at the start of the film and yet this is made real and convincing thanks to the use of news footage and also an air or atmosphere or intolerance that is much more effective than having 'big' moments (although it has those as well). Out of this, Milk's achievements and part of overall progress of the movement is clear and engaging. The slight downside of this is that the man himself is a little lost in the midst of this.OK we do get some personal stuff in there but it is very much by-the-by and not as interesting as the bigger picture. Don't get me wrong though, this is not a major problem because I felt the mix was appropriate for what the film was doing and I did like the balance it struck  just I can see why some of those familiar with Milk (I wasn't) may feel like he as a person isn't that well done. This aspect is helped though by Penn being good in the title role. He brings determination and vision to the character and, at the risk of being overly blunt, he 'does' a gay character without turning it into a caricature. Personally I don't think he was anywhere near as good as Rourke but the issues within this film had particular political importance in California in the year before these awards and this will have played in the film's favour Oscar-wise.Van Sant's direction is very good. There are clever shots and movements but never to the point that feel done for the sake of it or that they distract. His direction is well folded in with news footage from the time and it is to the credit of the costume and set departments that the film feels very of its time  even when set alongside this actual footage. The supporting cast also includes some very good turns. It is not Brolin's film and his material is too limited to allow him to really impress but he does go very well with his character. Likewise Franco, who is much better than I expected him to be. These are the standouts but generally the cast are convincing, with only one or two weaker turns that I felt did get close to caricature or cliché.Milk is not a perfect film and I can understand why those really familiar with the subject would have issues with the grand sweep of it and the lack of detail and perhaps development of Milk as a person. However it still works very well and accesses the importance of the man and the movement while also accurately capturing the sense of time and place. Perhaps not as emotionally impacting as a result, the film still does make a very good job of taking an important part of modern history and making it into a flowing and accessible piece of drama.",Null,3,6,9 March 2009
The Prestige," A very well told story despite the lack of shine in the final reveal (spoilers)
","Magician Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow magician Robert Angier, allegedly by positioning a lockable tank of water below a trap door that Angier fell as part of a trick. With the prosecution pushing for the death sentence, Cutter, experienced mentor to both men, relates the history between the two men. Starting as friends working as plants to support an established magician, their friendship turns into professional rivalry at first but a tragic accident sees the two enter a personal battle.Like everyone else, I want to be liked. I want people to think good of me and perhaps respect me; I don't think it is an unnatural thing and, no matter what they say, most people feel the same. However I have never pandered in my opinion to the majority voice and the IMDb's ridiculous 'was this comment useful' voting system will not deter me from questioning why this film is so highly thought of. On one level I can see why because it is a masterful piece of story-telling that weaves flashbacks within flashbacks as easily as moving between concurrent scenes set in the present (whenever that is in regards the narrative). In doing this it doesn't produce confusion as to when we are but rather makes the story much stronger and deeper. Nor did I have a problem with the sci-fi ideas being put into Victoria times; no, although the 'cloning' machine is a jump, it is only a jump because my head is stuck in the period and not accepting such an idea as I would in another film.No, the problem I had with it was the build up to an ending that I had to spend a lot of time thinking about. I didn't think so much because I didn't get it  I thought about it because I didn't think it would be so straightforward (in sci-fi terms of course) and predictable. The boards are full of debate over whether the machine works or not, but I think that the reason for this is that many are keen to find a twist and trick that isn't really there. This was a letdown for me and the delivery of the final scenes suggested that I should be taking it as a twist or surprise, but really it isn't. To me this stops it being as good as everyone else seems to think it is, but I still can see the strengths that kept it interesting for two hours.As said the story-telling is very strong, even if the conclusion isn't all I would have liked. Visual themes (clues?) are run throughout the film in a way that isn't clear until after the plot becomes clear. Ahead of this stuff though, is an engaging story in regards the characters, which was what drove the majority of the film for me. The flashback structure compliments the narrative well and produces characters sucked under by envy, hate, bitterness. With this to work with both Jackman and Bale give strong performances that really drew the script out and made this aspect so interesting to me. Caine is a class-act as he often can be but some of the other casting is questionable. Serkis I have no problem with in a minor role, but Bowie is always a risky prospect (see Fire Walk With Me for proof  or rather lack of proof since he was cut down to a minimum to the detriment of the film). Here he isn't terrible but he certainly isn't any good. Johansson I'm not sure about as an actress. She is pretty as a young woman but her acting isn't always up to scratch and here she is pretty average at best.Overall then, not as brilliant as everyone would have you believe because the conclusion is nowhere near as strong (or surprising) as the delivery and build-up within the film would suggest (far less the gushing praise and theorising herein). The manner of telling is masterful though and works so well that perhaps it accounts for my problems late in the game. The lead pair respond well to this, both turning in very strong performances. A very good film then, just not as wonderful and flawless as the praise on this site would have you believe.",Null,7,13,12 July 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Beautiful to behold but the average plotting and characterisations balance that out to make a solid and entertaining blockbuster
","Despite his best efforts, the work of the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defence is still secret, with Hellboy unable to be more than some blurred photos leaked onto the net and Agent Manning stressed out about the difficulty in controlling his team. Behind the scenes, internal relationships between Hellboy and Liz are strained, with Liz keeping a secret that will change their lives. They quickly have to focus on much bigger problems though as Elf prince Nuada returns from his self-imposed exile to take the throne of his father and awaken the legendary Golden Army to break the long-held truce between his people and humanity. So begins a race against time for both sides, to recover the three pieces of the golden crown needed to awaken and command the indestructible army of 4900 golden machines.The Hellboy series has yet to really excite me as part 2 left me with the same overwhelming feeling of it being 'OK' that the first film had done. In reviewing the first film I had said that if it carries on then I doubt it would get much more than one more film unless it addressed these issues and mostly I felt that the film didn't look to the core of the weakness. This is in how unengaging I found it and it comes from the plotting and the characters. Here we have a solid enough plot that offers another opportunity to force Hellboy down a 'you with them or with us?' line as well as 'developing' the characters by way of changing relationship dynamics. These things are all done but they are not really 'delivered' so much as just put on the screen like you would put books on a shelf. This pure functionality in the writing is pretty much what keeps me from really getting into it and in this regard it is just like the first film, except this time it can't be covered by the 'introduction' format and it stands out a bit more than it should So what we are left with is actually quite a 'normal' blockbuster in regards plot and characters. We have the world in danger, we have a grumpy hero with an arsenal of guns and one-liners, a good looking woman, sidekicks, nasty villains and so on. As a result we do get a reasonably solid film but it does help that for all the lack of imagination in his script, del Toro has brought his A-game in the design and realisation of the creatures. As a work of visual creativity, the film is wonder of weird creations that are fascinating and inventive. The problem is that perhaps the rest of the film doesn't deserve this level of creativity in this aspect because the rest of it doesn't fit.The cast mostly find themselves working within the parts that are not as good as the design. Perlman is always a bad-ass presence and as such is welcome in the character, but he can't do much with it other than be 'big' and 'mean'; what few chances there are to do more are awkward because it doesn't fit with the majority of what he is doing. Blair is a better actress than this film would suggest and again she is handed a 'development' subplot that isn't actually developed and as a result she doesn't convince - doesn't always look the most natural in busy FX scenes either. Goss and Walton are not the best villains but they are engaging enough to carry their parts. Jones is the usual good 'man in a suit' across several characters and brings physical presence to those characters well. Tambor is left with a comedy role that is not actually that funny, while the addition of the character Krauss is a nice one.Hellboy 2 is not a great film but it is still a solid and engaging one. To look at clips or still though, you would expect so much more because visually it is wonderfully designed in the creatures and sets that are throughout, but this imagination and creativity is lacking in other aspects such as characters, script and plotting. It never bored me or made me hate it but at the same time it never really excited or engaged me as a total film. Almost worth seeing just for the visual extravagance of it but disappointing for the rest of it being rather ordinary by comparison.",Null,6,9,15 October 2008
Cloverfield," The gimmick in the delivery is effective and impressive in the midst of the action but the characters and narrative take away more than they add
","A group of young New Yorkers are holding a surprise going-away party in Upper-East-Side Manhattan, with the only excitement being revelations about the relationships between some of the friends. However a massive boom brings the party to an end and everyone heads to the roof in time to see further explosions, culminating with the head of the Statue of Liberty hitting their block. They attempt to flee Manhattan along with everyone else on the island while the military flood in from the other direction but a phone message from one of the group sees them heading back to try and rescue her as well.The first 'big' film of 2008 deserves credit for what it does very well indeed, which is its marketing strategy. Although I failed to see any of the trailers until the week before release, even I knew about it a year ago. Given the extent of the hype surrounding the film, it is hard to fault it in this regard. However when I got around to actually seeing the film, the way it had been sold was not really a factor in my enjoyment (or not) of it so I put this all to one side. The film opens slowly with an introduction to the characters and establishing of the party for later but after what does seem like an age we get the 'attack' finally happening and with it comes the panic and hand-held chaos that the trailers gave us.The next twenty minutes or so of this are great as we are thrown right into the middle of it and the effect is dizzying but yet very real. Many have compared this to the Blair Witch Project in its gimmick (the discovered 'real' tape watched after the event) but this is not the gimmick that I think Cloverfield is built on. Instead the film relies heavily on the fact that we have all watched the news in the last two years and will have experienced many 'real' events through the eyes of camera-phones and shaky-handed survivors as they are replayed on the network news programmes. This is a clever and effective gimmick and it is one that is at its strongest when it is making the action and attack the focus.Sadly the gimmick does not work as well when it is trying to hold a narrative together because this is not what we are used to. Of course it doesn't help that the story is not that great. I didn't really want a mission back into the city and it did feel like the plot had been come up with to try and ensure ongoing action in the danger-zones rather than everyone running away. Massive coincidences ensure this feels more clunky and obvious than it should and, outside of the most intense scenes, you do feel it. The fact that I didn't like the characters was probably a bit of an obstacle to me as well. It is not just that they are young, it is that they are impossibly beautiful people who live wonderful lives in a wonderful city; it would not have hurt to have had a bit of diversity in the group to try and reduce this but then I suppose the makers know who their target audience are. The cast of mostly unknowns deliver well enough in terms of running and being frightened convincingly while looking attractive but the film is not about them and they are annoying at the times when the detail of their problems become the focus. I did like that the film treat them all as equally disposable though.Reeves directs the action really well though and is helped by tremendous special effects that manage to feel real whether it is the destruction of buildings or a massive lizardy creature being fired on by jets. Indeed this is what the film is best at as it recreates the feeling of fear and destruction that we all experienced on television on 11th September 2001. Overall then this is why it is worth seeing  for the parts where the city is being destroyed and we are simply stuck in the middle of it all; just a shame that the characters and story seem to get in the way more than that they enhance the experience.",Null,2,5,17 February 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Well directed gothic fairy tale
","In 1799 Constable Ichabod Crane is sent from New York to investigate a spate of murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow.  The townsfolk believe that the murders are the work of a headless horseman who beheads his victims but Crane believes it is a matter for logic and science.  Crane investigates however his faith in science and logic grows increasingly threatened when he is confronted with things that cannot be explained away by modern police work and logical ways of thinking.I'm a Tim Burton fan, only finding a few of his films to be misguided or poor.  I greatly looked forward to this film, hoping for a nightmarish fairy tale feel to it and for the most part I was rewarded for my expectations. For the majority of the film we are treated to the horseman gleefully wrecking havoc while Crane delivers humour as well as being our wide eyed observer.The plot itself is pretty free flowing until the last 20 minutes where it becomes a more standard detective mystery of sorts.  Many feel this is a letdown and in a way it is mostly because it is a change of pace and style. However it delivers well and has good action and stunts with a good pace. The tidy ends may go against the nature of the film but I still enjoyed it. Up till this point it is very dark and bloody and Burton has stamped his vision all over this.The cast is full of well know faces and is mostly very good.  Depp is funny and deadpan and carries the central role well.  On the downside Ricci is pretty poor.  She looks good but she has no chemistry with Depp and is pale and fails to make an impact.  A support cast of Gambon, Jones, Richardson, Van Dien, Lee and Griffiths all do well and deliver interesting characters. Walken may be limited in terms of screen time but he is an inspired bit of casting and has a strong presence as the horseman.Overall the majority of this film has Burton's vision stamped all over it. He carries the film well with gleeful bloodletting and a good humour.  The end may be all a bit mystery-solving but even it is delivered with some good action scenes.  Not Burton's best film but an enjoyable gothic fairy tale.",Null,2,3,11 November 2002
Hotel Rwanda," An imperfect film but still a devastatingly emotional one that cries out to be seen (mild spoilers)
","In 1994 tensions are high in Rwanda between the ruling Hutus and the Tutsis rebels while the UN tries to broken a peace agreement. This is of little interest to Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu with a Tutsis wife whose position within a leading hotel means he has to curry favour with many officials and smoothing over any potential problems at every turn. When the Hutu president is assassinated, a massacre of Tutsis begin  adults and children alike. With the UN unable to take action due to the indifference of the West the murders continue and Paul finds himself with a hotel, evacuated of important whites but full of Tutsis refugees as the Hutus seek to finish the job they started.I'm not entirely sure how one can review this film with a clear mind because no matter how good or bad a film it is, it is near impossible not to left shaken by the events it depicts. The plot follows the story of Paul Rusesabagina, who pulled all the strings he could to protect the Tutsis refugees who wound up in his hotel during the genocide by the Hutus. In this regard we are given a way into the atrocities through this specific story and this is both a strength and a weakness in the telling. The strength is that it gives us a focal point and a point of emotional connection that we can relate to and see a human face in the way that the terrifying numbers do not. However the downside of this is that it makes the story smaller than it could have been and puts the scale of atrocities outside of our direct view for the majority. It also means that it produces a 'happy' ending that leaves you with a sense of some respite (not to mention the obligatory 'African' song). This was a problem for me because the film had succeeded in gutting me at points and I didn't want to be left with any upbeat note  I wanted to go away feeling just like the foreign photographer did; 'f**king ashamed'.However considering what the film does well, it is petty and unfair to make a bit issue out of the fact that the narrative is occasionally a bit clunky and perhaps that the depiction of the genocide doesn't go far enough. Even without graphic violence and more than one scene of actual horror the film still sickened me to my stomach, had me almost shaking with anger and fear while at the same time failing to prevent tears rolling. Like many viewers I knew little more than a genocide occurred and couldn't have told you which side was killing the other  this is not ignorance on my behalf but just the fact that the West ignored this and stood by while it occurred while the media gave it little or no coverage. The film depicts this very well giving us enough horror and enough human emotion mixed with an understanding of the West's attitude to produce an impression of an event that is indefensible and truly, truly horrific. The characters are quite broadly painted but they do enough to give us an understanding of what occurred. While I do feel that the film could have shown more and been wider, the close focus on the hotel and the Rusesabagina's means that we are never far from understanding the true extent of horror and just how much of a reality death is  Paul does not discuss how his family will survive if the hotel is stormed, only how they will die in the least horrific way.Matching the tone of the film are two performances that blow away everyone they were nominated with at the 2005 Oscars. Cheadle's accent in Ocean's 11 was the worst cockney this side of Mary Poppins but here he gets the accent and mannerisms just right and made me forget that he was an American. His character changes throughout the film and he copes with it really well, producing a character that is easy to get behind and provides a very human face to the story. Okonedo is superb and is almost impossible to watch without being moved to tears more than once. Nolte is effectively gruff although he is less a character than he is a symbol of how ineffective the UN was at the time. In a similar vein Phoenix is excellent in a small role although really I could have done with a few less starry cameos as they tended to distract from the main material. Outside of the lead two, the actors are not given as much to work with as the lead two but Cheadle and Okonedo are superb and match the emotional impact of the material.Overall this is not a perfect film; it didn't quite go far enough and the focus on a small group tended to conceal the scale of the genocide. However this is a minor complaint because the film is devastatingly effective and is impossible to watch without feeling lost, helpless and utterly ashamed for our inaction. This is not an easy watch and will not be a fun night out for the audience but for many reasons it deserves as large an audience as possible.",Null,18,25,31 March 2005
Once," Not as brilliant as the lavish praise would suggest but still natural, charming and refreshingly free of sentiment
","In Dublin, a guy works in his father's vacuum-cleaner repair shop while also pursuing his musical aspirations by busking on the streets. Late one night he meets an immigrant girl selling the Big Issue who likes his songs but also has a vacuum cleaner that needs fixing. He helps her out and gets to known her, finding she has talent on the piano as well. He has an girlfriend that has recently moved to London without him, while the girl has a husband back in Czechoslovakia and a young child with her in Dublin. While she helps him musically look to achieve his dreams, something more intimate and personal may or may not be developing between them.I first heard of this film when it showed up on various 'best of the year' lists and added it to my rental list and got it posted to me shortly after the film won the Oscar for best song. The first thing that I should say that is that it is my opinion that this film has been overly praised  this is not a criticism of the film but rather a defence, because the hype works against this film being what it is. That is to say, Once is a very low budget film that has it strength in the general charm and sweetness but it is not, to my mind, a fantastic film and certainly its inclusion on IMDb's top 250 just further serves to take away any remaining relevance I give to that list.Narratively the film is simple as it mostly trades on the songs and characters, with the love story very much unspoken and on the edges of the picture all the time. In regards specific actions there are few and the characters don't develop much beyond where they are shortly after they are introduced at the start of the film. What tends to hook the audience (and me) is the way that the film is so raw, natural and charming and, in this way, it flies in the face of many mainstream romances with their contrived stories and sickly sentimentality. This 'breath of fresh air' quality helps it a great deal and the Irish charm does easily appeal to many audience sectors I believe, because some of their work is done beforehand with their idealised view of artists within that country! That shouldn't take anything away from Hansard and Irglová, both of whom are natural and convincing as people  although the slight downside of this is that Hansard's 'Guy' is a bit of a jerk early on, while it can be painful to see them never say what is in the background. Carney's direction of his script is solid; OK it is all very shaky and low-budget but it fits the material while also being admirable for making the film despite the challenges.Overall then, this is a charming little modern love story that is refreshingly natural and free of sentiment. It is not perfect and it won't knock you off your feet in the way that many reviews may lead you to believe but it is certainly a lovely little film that is warm, musical and charming.",Null,6,10,4 May 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A tad confusing in the telling, but excellent in the tone
","There is a certain snobbery with films that require more than a small amount of attention – an opinion that if you even ask about a small detail that you missed that you should then go watch Transformers and leave real films to the grownups. It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot, even if some bits of it did lose me.I've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC mini-series, so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this two-hour film, but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson, because there is a constant tension to the film – cold perhaps, but very tense at times, certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.This is not what he does best though, because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness, of an unnecessary function and a pointless 'war'. This feeling is in the characters, in the set-decoration and in every shot. The men we follow had the height of their import many years ago – now it appears they are mainly fighting their equal numbers on the other side simply because they exist. I really liked this overarching sense of smallness that sat across the film and I enjoyed finding it being employed in even the smallest detail – in the attitude of a minor character through to the cheap 'do not unplug' text scrawled on the wall (those that work in older offices will know this feeling). Alfredson is bang on the money with this feeling, it is part of the story and it is brilliantly delivered throughout.Speaking of brilliant delivery, the cast is deep in British talent and unsurprisingly they deliver. Oldman may not have won the Oscar but he is great here – working with restraint and doing so much. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. He is the lead here but alongside him is a cast that is hard not to just list – Cumberbach, Hurt, Jones, Firth, Burke, Graham, Hardy and so on; British all perhaps but it says a lot that almost all of the supporting players here will be recognised internationally. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing.Overall, this is a great film albeit one that is not as easy to follow as those impatient snobs would have you believe. It is OK to struggle with some aspects and it is still easy to enjoy the film. The plot engaged me but what stayed with me more than anything else was how it all seemed so unimportant, how those involved were all working to ignore the irrelevance of their work and how very tired this world seemed – this aspect was very well done and made the film as much as Oldman's strong central performance.",Null,129,151,8 April 2012
The Hateful Eight," Seems setup for tightness and tension but then combines it with slow pace and sweeping scale, which don't wholly work together
","Although I am not blind to his weaknesses, I do confess that I enjoy Tarantino's work and in particular love his writing of pulpy dialogue and the way he can draw tension from even the most innocent conversation. His films are littered with examples, and it is this element of his work that drew me to The Hateful Eight. The combination of a single location with a load of actors capable of delivering the material, made me assume we were in for a film where tension built across the whole film in the way he has done with individual scenes before.The reality is that the film partly manages this, and for sure there is pleasure to be had in his combination of dialogue driven scenes with sudden violent interludes. However at almost three hours, there is simply too much film and not enough content. Considering that the film is more or less set in a single room for most of the film one wonders why it also tries to be such an epic in presentation. Okay the opening hour is mostly on the trail and has some great sweeping landscapes and vistas, but even then the real action is inside a wagon. This duality did work against the film for me because it feels so sprawling, but yet the actual narrative seems to be driven by scenes that require a tightness and tension, and it doesn't wholly come together. The setting and the spread of characters occasionally has some interesting things to say about race and politics, however it is too saggy in the delivery and takes way too long to deliver everything, that it does tend to lose impact in many ways.Those that like his work (as I do) will still find a lot to enjoy (as I did), but Hateful Eight is a flawed film. The cast really enjoy their performances even if they don't quite have the presence of equivalent characters or scenes, whether it be moments that invoke Reservoir Dogs, or Tim Roth for some reason playing a version of Waltz's character in Django. The film looks gorgeous and has a great score, but it is the writing that brings in the issues. The lack of discipline in the delivery robs the film of a lot of the power it should have had, and in the end while it should be a satisfying resolution to the mystery, instead it because loud, bloody, unpleasantly mean-spirited and surprisingly unengaging and lacking the tension all the parts suggest it should have had.",Null,5,13,7 February 2016
Catch-22," Lacks character development  but those familiar with the book will find much to love here
","During the second world war Captain Yossarian decides he is fed up with flying missions of ever increasing numbers and tries to get grounded on the grounds of insanity.  However Doc Daneeka informs him of a catch  all he has to do is ask to stop flying, however if he doesn't want to fly he must be sane and hence must fly!  This mother of all catches is catch-22.  With this still in his mind Yossarian finds a world of death, madness and profiteering of both a financial and political nature.  The war has gone mad!Based on my favourite book this had the potential for me to hate it or love it.  The book is fantastic as both a character comedy and a satire on war  I have read it over 10 tens and still love it.  This helped me with the film because I know the characters so well.  The `story' is very fragmented and moves quickly, if you don't know the characters then you may find yourself having trouble keeping up.  However the film manages to bring most of the characters to life  although many are either only mentioned (hungry Joe) or have brief scenes (Major Major).  This is excusable as the film concentrates on the point of the book  the insanity around war  and carries that off well.The film jumps around between scens and though time  however Nichols manages to tie it all together well and creates a sort of structure out of a difficult situation.  The cast are brilliant and full of now-famous faces. Arkin is a marvelous Yossarian  hats of to casting!  He's world weary sort of manner is a credit to the character.  Art Garfunkel has never been a good actor, but he seems to fit as the naive Nately.  In fact all characters seem to fit  Gilford's Doc is bang on, Blasam and Benjamin are great as Carthcart and Danby and Newhart's Major Major is as it should be  if only he was given more time.  Martin Sheen is good in a small role with a nice cameo from Orson Welles.  The two main actors are Perkins and Voight. Perkins' Chaplin is stuttering and shy as he should be and Voight's Milo Minderbender is absolutely insane inside a sane body  his full story isn't told but much of his madness is included.The quick flow of this film means that the characters and settings come and go quickly  that's why this never manages to be as good as M*A*S*H*.  If you've read the book then you can fill the rest in yourself, but without that knowledge then you may not fully get it and be left cold by the speed and lack of character development.However Nichols has done well.  The book was always going to be difficult to adapt and stripping it to the bear characters and key events it has managed to keep the point  that war is madness.  Not a perfect film  but for lovers of the book this is a great chance to meet all those great characters in the flesh (sort of).",Null,4,12,19 April 2002
We Were Soldiers," Mostly good war movie despite being too long and having a tendency towards sentimentality
","When Lt Col Hal Moore is drafted back in to lead a new platoon of men he didn't know that he would lead them into the first major battle of the Americans' entry into the Vietnam war. This is the story of that battle where the unit was dropped into the middle of the action, mere miles from the main base camp of the enemy and was immediately attacked by a prepared enemy who had a better knowledge of the terrain.Although I have seen many Vietnam movies, I would certainly claim no understanding or knowledge of individual battles or tactics and to be honest, the main interest I have in battles of the period would focus on the military action in my own country of the time because I think it is important to know your own culture and understanding who you are. However I am interesting and will certainly always appreciate a war film that tells it like it is and isn't just a gung-ho, flag waving glorification of death. Looking at the cast list for this film though, made me think that perhaps it would be the latter and thus I didn't bother with it in the cinema. Having now seen the film for myself I must admit that I was partly wrong because the film is not all glorification but the mix of trying to do too much perhaps weakens it and does make it tend towards this at times.In some ways the film succeeds because it is interesting in the way it focuses on one particular battle and does convincingly capture the horror of death during war  it is impossible to watch this and not be moved by the sheer waste of life it shows. Indeed the director is at pains to make sure we see the impact back home, even to the detriment of the film as I understood the loss without seeing crying families. The director also seems to be making great efforts to cover all bases and present the whole picture in some regards but yet fails in others; so we have balanced views of the enemies and the dialogue is clear of ethnic insults and lingo but yet at the same time we never seem anything that would condemn the war  hence we have no friendly fire incidents or really any deaths that are less than noble. This is a weakness of the film  it can't help but slightly glorify or sugar coat the total product; hence the start and end lack the emotional impact of the battle scenes and although the film is about the loss of life and waste of youth, it still hits a 'noble' and 'worthy' note that some may feel undermines the message the rest of it seems to be putting out.Even though this is my gut reaction, I know I'm being a little unfair because, when portraying real men who died younger than me, then why not give them the dignity they deserve, but it is a difficult mix to carry off and, while good, I'm not sure the film totally managed to do it. The cast have the hardest job and many of them don't do anything beyond the predictable. Gibson is all very heroic, noble and courageous and he does the job but the rest of his men are a lot less effective in pigeon-hole roles. Elliot is good but obvious as a gruff Sgt-Major, Kinnear is a heroic fly-boy, Klein is the young father and so on. The women have less material to work with and are left with the histrionics to deliver  Stowe is the lead in a collection of good but mostly unnecessary performances. While none of them really have strong characters to work with, the majority do enough to pass muster in this film and I was pleased that Gibson was a lot more human than Braveheart suggested he would be.Overall this is a solid war movie that manages to mix the horror with the nobility of war  a difficult trick to pull off and unfortunately a mix that will niggle sections of the audience who came for flagwaving and got depressing reality and vice versa those that came for gritty horror and got too much sentimentality. The cast are better than the names involved would suggest, even if they don't have much to do and some do have 'movie soldier' dialogue to deliver in unconvincing ways (eg 'I'm glad to...die....for...my...country') but it is still worth seeing even if there are better Vietnam movies.",Null,10,18,19 April 2005
Molly's Game," Well-paced for the most part, but a little long, and doesn't find the heart much
","The true story of Molly Bloom, who begins the film being arrested by armed FBI agents. From this teaser we jump back to see the path that led Molly to organize an exclusive high-stakes poker game for sports stars, Hollywood royalty, and, eventually, Russian mobsters.Opening with a downhill skiing incident which is broken down in a snappy and slick presentation, Molly's Game is very much about the slickness and snappiness of the whole piece. This is perhaps not a surprise from Sorkin given his style, but it makes the film mostly very enjoyable as it moves well and suits the confidence of Molly and the exotic nature of her world. The narration adds to the film and it moves well for the most part. It does run a little long and towards the end I started to feel the length in a way I had not up till that point. Part of this is that it doesn't totally find the heart within the character - Chastain is very good when it comes to convincing of this young woman moving in such circles, but less good at why we should care for her. Another part of this is the way the film brings it home, because it has moments which don't ring true and seem overly convenient (the return of the father for instance).Overall, the content and the slick way it is all delivered makes it engaging and worth watching, but it does have weaknesses, and it runs longer than it can totally stand.",Null,1,4,27 August 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Weak on suspense, plotting, atmosphere and characters but has some great set-pieces and is enjoyable for its constant movement and noise
","Like many others, I grew up on the Tintin books although I didn't really have strong feelings about this film one way or the other; I didn't see the character as something to be protected nor something to get excited about seeing in a film, although I was interested. Happy to wait till I could get it at home (and then some) I watched this recently and did so with the knowledge that the commercial and critical response to the film's release last year maybe hadn't been all everyone was hoping. The plot sees Tintin buying a model ship that several people seem very keen to get their hands on. This simple purchase leads to murder and soon he is caught up in a race to uncover treasure before the mysterious Sakharine can find it first.The film offers a decent story with core parts of it coming directly from the original books but mostly it doesn't do a great job of delivering it. There isn't a strong base to the plot and there isn't really anything that made me invest in what I was watching. This was ironically caused by what the film did pretty well, which was to deliver near constant movement. The film does have some very well constructed and delivered set-pieces which flow really well and look great in terms of the spectacle and the way the 'camera' moves around them. There is the problem that there is almost too many of them and at times the film feels too frantic and with too little peril or investment. It is not because it is animated, it can happen with films where the characters just seem to never really be in danger. It is very good as a family- friendly action movie though and although I found it not to be particularly memorable, I did find it enjoyably light and fluid.The animation is quite amazing in terms of how realistic it looks. There is still a very odd look to the characters, where they are realistic enough to forget they are animated but not so realistic that they stop looking a little bit weird. This would have maybe been a problem if the film spent long on the characters but to be honest it all moves so fast we're never lingering long on the characters. The voice work is OK but most of them struggle because they don't have a lot of character or fun dialogue – even Haddock is a little less colorful than I expected. Bell and Serkis are solid while Pegg and Frost are perhaps a bit too obvious. I liked Craig as the villain as he had something about him as a character which was added to by the voice-work, but mostly this seemed to be a film about movement and as a result the performances never seemed particularly important.Tintin got a bit of a bad reception but it is a perfectly fine family film with some great set-pieces and plenty of movement. It is weaker when it comes to suspense, tension, plotting and characters and it is hard not to see those having an impact, but generally it is enjoyable for what it is.",Null,0,0,1 September 2013
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Western? No  but a warming and funny gentle comedy
","Cassidy and Sundance are part of the Hole in the Wall gang.  However the West is becoming harder for criminals and soon they find themselves the target of a posse.  Wherever they go they are followed.  Eventually they travel to Bolivia to escape the heat, but can they manage to go straight?This is one of the slightest and flimsiest westerns of modern days.  Even Young Guns has more cohesive plotting than this.  However that's not what this is all about.  For all it's lightness it is really, really good fun. To all intents and purposes it's a comedy regardless of the period it is set in.  The plot does little but provide some funny chases and ample oppourtunity for the two stars to play off each other to great effect.Ross is good but really this is only Newman and Redford's film, and they play it well.  Both have a great rapport with the other and it adds to the bickering etc.  Their lines are all great and the film lives and dies with them.  It has slow portions and bits that don't really work too well, but as long as Newman and Redford are on screen then fun is never too far away.Overall this is not a great western, but as a classic buddy comedy it's bang on.  Funny and warming every time you watch it this is a great film.",Null,6,11,2 August 2002
Moana," Great story and songs
","It was my daughter that meant I watched this film - and it was her that has meant that I have watched it at least 20 times now, albeit not always sitting and focused on it as it deserves. The plot sees a non-traditional Disney princess setting out to save her island by crossing the sea to return the heart of a deity and heal the decay. On its face it had the potential to have plenty wrong with it - it could have played heavily on the social inclusion of the non-white princess; it could have been heavy with the environmental message; and it could have been generally too sentimental. Instead it gets the tone completely correct in how it produces an exciting film, with great music, focused around a really strong title character.As a story it has plenty of incident and action, but yet carries off a personal development story just as well as anything else. The most obvious are the two leads, with Moana in particular growing and developing through the film, but I liked very much how little details and touches fill out other characters and created a bigger sense of character. The one that sticks with me the most is the father figure as even before we know anything about his experience at sea, there is an early song with the quick line 'in time you'll learn, just as I did', which tells us about a certain amount of 'acceptance' in his life at one point. It is a great line a in a great song and it speaks to the depth and quality in the design of the film.The writing is very good, in dialogue, in narrative sweep, and in the songs. It all comes together with very good voicework from everyone involved, with the high quality of animation making it a very accomplished film. I'm always surprised by how it has the capacity to move me even though it is a children's film that is usually on because the daughter wanted it. Well worth a look even if you don't have children, because there is a lot to recommend about it even for adult viewers.",Null,0,3,22 September 2019
Ocean's Twelve," Reasonably entertaining but the messy plot and lack of cohesion really suck the fizz out of it  even if the stars appear to be really enjoying it
","Several years on from their job in Las Vegas and Danny Ocean's crew have been sold out to Terry Benedict, who has visited each of them to give them two weeks to pay back the money they stole, with interest. Too hot to work in America, the crew head to Europe to pull off a series of jobs to earn the money but find themselves outsmarted by another 'master' thief who is willing to pay off their debt if Ocean will indulge him in a challenge to see who is the best thief. So, with Benedict and Interpol Detective Isabel Lahiri breathing down their necks, the crew come together to pull off the job.With the remake of Ocean's Eleven, things seemed to move so quickly with such flair and style that substance didn't matter that much and it managed to pull off the trick and come across as fluffy fun. The sequel clearly tries to pull off the same trick but it cannot manage it and, although it has some fun moments, it ends up being pretty messy, lacking slick pace and failing to really please the audience in the way that its predecessor did. The plot feels like it has been forced and it cannot cope with the messy detail nor move fast enough to distract us from it; whole sections make little sense and, when the final twist comes you will struggle not to feel betrayed by how you have spent the hour before. Instead of a nice narrative flow the film is more like a series of set pieces  few of these really work that well and some of them fall quite flat. Even when they worked I couldn't shake the feeling that the cast were enjoying it more than us; certainly this appeared to be the case with the whole 'look-a-likey' collection of in-jokes and several of the other scenes.The cast are enjoying themselves but that doesn't mean that the film uses them well at all. Clooney and Pitt are good because they have plenty of screen time and ooze cool for the majority of the film. Damon cuts his way into the screen time with a nice line of joking about 'coming up' but Roberts and Jones are really pushed to the edges of the film even if they do have some things to contribute. Affleck, Caan, Garcia, Qin, Mac, Cheadle, Reiner, Gould and Coltrane are all pretty wasted and are often just pushed out of the story for the sake of convenience (Mac and Qin are two very good examples). Willis is actually quite amusing, Cassel is not that bad and Izzard is pretty good in a minor role.Overall though the film is never better than average; reasonably entertaining at best. The plot is all over the place and cannot even distract the audience enough so that the holes are hidden until the end; as it is the second half of the film is a shambles and I couldn't help but be annoyed by it  hell, it doesn't even have the gloss, shine and flair of the first film. The cast appear to have enjoyed themselves but many of them have next to nothing to do and it all just feels a bit too cluttered for most of the time. The first vehicle was fun and slick; this one tries to keep up but stalls way too many times.",Null,5,9,13 February 2005
Crash," A flawed narrative cannot put a dent in the strength of the characters, themes, acting and all round writing
","A minor car accident is the end of the story. It is here where a group of strangers of all races and classes connect, whether they know it or not.It is a simple premise that sets up a Short Cuts style story of multiple characters and stories that only have brief narrative connections but yet, in this film, have significant thematic links. In this case it is race and this is what the film is about  not a car crash but a personal picture of a city that is split along lines of race, class, wealth and, simply put, the fact that people are people (bad and good) no matter where they fall in these categories. For this reason some people may find the story itself to occasionally be contrived, it goes to extremes, it pushes the action beyond what can easily be swallowed and every link in the chain is about colour. However to me this was not a problem because I understood that this is what the film was about and the focus was not this story, not other aspects of the characters lives (eg not a political thriller about a cover up) but about their views on race and the impacts they have.As such it is relentlessly interesting and thoughtful and Haggis has crafted a screenplay that works on so many levels. It tackles many issues and it doesn't pander to any one ethnic group  doesn't allow poverty to be an excuse or privilege a let-off. The film is in the characters and again it is impressive how well Haggis has, with so little time on each, avoiding clichés and created characters we care about and are able to easily understand. Haggis doesn't give answers  everyone gets their space to be complex, everyone gets their chance to struggle. If I did have to take a message it would be that 'people are good or bad no matter what colour they are' but writing this sounds so corny and I assure you that if the film does deliver a message, it certainly doesn't force it down your throat. Yes the coincidences are all very tidy and unlikely at times, while the action does go to extremes to set things up, but if you are focusing on this aspect of the film to the point where it bothers you, then you are probably not allowing yourself to think around the theme  which is what Haggis is focusing on after all.The cast are impressive on paper but few scream out as superb leading actors, so I was surprised by how many were actually very strong, and kept the script from creating clichés (even covering the extremes of the narrative well). To pick one for praise is hard but Dillon works well with a complex character that you hear on the radio phone-ins all the time, that forgotten, oppressed minority group, the poor white man. Dillon doesn't force his point, he is honest to the character and he is excellent  you hate his views while also agreeing with them. A slimmed Bullock is also very impressive, she is fully in touch with her frightened, angry character and the script trusts her to do a lot herself  which she is more than able to. I have never knowingly liked Howard but here he is very good, bringing the conflicts within his character to the surface without being so crude as to use words to spell it all out (a compliment that applies to most of the cast actually). He is supported well by Newton, who has a smaller role than I expected but was still impressive. Fraser is solid and reliable, which is all the film asks for; he won't win awards but with such talent around him, it is no surprise not to have him shine. Cheadle is as good as he is proving he can be of late  his character is flawed regardless of colour and he is the key to a lot of the point (he is also blessed with the funniest line in the film). One of the biggest surprises to me was Ludicrous, a man whose music is so unashamedly unpolitical and booty-worshiping that I expected very little of him. However he avoids cliché really well and turns in a performance that deserves to be noted in the face of so many of his peers churning out offensive and demeaning 'ethnic' comedies. Phillippe is another guy I just don't rate but even he is good here  his character is the 'good guy who sees no colour' but assumes the very worst when pushed and is left with nothing to cling to; it was a challenge and I was very impressed by how well he pulled it off. Tate is more relaxed but he is natural and that is what was required. Support from David, Esposito, Finchtner and others is all good and helps give the feel of a film deep in quality, which it is. I know I have missed some of the cast out  but I have a word limit and I can't do them all justice within that.Overall this is not the film to come to looking for a simple, acceptable narrative because it is here that it is weakest. All the stories play race issues as their central theme and the events are often extreme and unconvincing. However this is not the focus  the themes of race, empathy, flawed people (not races) and other issues are what we are there for and the script does well to address those without forcing them down our throats while also avoiding cliché and making good characters with very little time. In this area he is helped by a great cast all hitting the target producing a flawed film that is also very strong indeed.",Null,5,17,8 September 2005
Snatch," Style without substance
","A Diamond heist by Franky Four Fingers is carried out and he flies into London on a stop over.  He goes to Boris The Blade for a gun and Boris tells him to go to the bookies for him and put money on a fight in exchange. Boris then sets Frankie up and has a group of men waiting to rob the bookies and Frankie.  The fight in question is also difficult because promoters Turkish and Tommy have promised local villain Brick Top that they'll put up a fighter.  Said fighter is put in hospital by a gypsy Tommy buys a caravan from (Mickey).  Putting Mickey in the fight makes things worse when he not only refuses to take a dive but knocks the fighter out  to Bricktop's displeasure!  Meanwhile Frankie's boss flies into London to find him and the jewel while Bricktop tries to catch the men who Boris sent to knock over his bookies.I had seen Lock, Stock and enjoyed it to a certain degree.  It had problems but it was fresh and had energy and style.  It re-launched the British gangster film with some good ones and some bad copies.  One of those copies was Snatch  admittedly a copy by the same director!  This film has all the style and energy of the Lock, Stock and borrows heavily from it.  However it is clear that the plot is both weak and over-plotted (if that's possible!). It is weak because it is so full of cliché and silly occurrences and it is over-plotted in that every scene needs more plot in order to explain the new thing that just happened!What keeps it watchable is Ritchie's style and energy.  The plot may not work but it moves along with pace that almost (almost) covers it's lack of substance.  So we get the same old cockney gangsterisms, dark humour, Vinnie Jones being tough with a few good lines and so on.  It felt to me like Ritchie just didn't have any other ideas in him.  It's all very samey but his style saves it as he intercuts and delivers some really inventive shots. In tune with this style and energy is the casting.  The film is much better cast that it deserves!Statham and Graham are the least colourful characters in the piece and Ritchie knows it  so despite being the leads, they often play second fiddle and only act as the catalyst.  Ford, Reid, Jones et al all enjoy delivering tough old stereotypes and do well enough considering what they're there to do.  Pitt is a great bit of casting  and here he is DELIBERATELY doing a bad Irish accent (unlike Devil's Own where it was an accident!).  He is funny and seems to enjoy playing out of type.  Likewise Del Toro and Farina can only help add class to the film.Overall though this is a victory for style over substance.  It's visual style and general energy will carry it for the running time but when it was over I found it had failed to make any lasting impact on it and I really could remember very little of it  it had just seemed noisy and in a rush to get somewhere.  Sure, I enjoyed it while it was on, but as little as 10 minutes afterwards I realised that I'd been taken for a ride by the style and flair of Ritchie.  At time of writing it is 199 in the top 250  you gotta be kidding me!",Null,28,48,30 December 2002
BlacKkKlansman," Uneven and messy but heartfelt in what it is trying to do
","A new Spike Lee film is usually good news for white liberal-leaning viewers such as myself; and one that goes after the Trump-infused rise of white nationalism is doubly so. Knowing myself target audience does tend to temper the viewing experience though, because I know I am more prone to like it for the familiarity of camera movements, scoring, and political slant - and all of this can distract from the film itself. Many critics seem to have done the same, because this is not as strong a film as many would have you believe.Set within a true story, the guts of it is engaging in its focus on character and place. There is a certain irony that the true elements of the story also tend to produce what feels like plot holes, and these do tend to distract. The quality of the delivery helps carry it too, because generally the writing is not sharp; it is worthy, it is important, yes, but it is not crisp or clever. The thread through from the past to the modern day doesn't totally work because it plays the KKK characters as pretty low or obvious types, sometimes even enjoying a laugh at their expense. The link from that to the real death of a person last year feels hollow - the end is powerful, but it feels dropped in, not part of the whole.In moments and in sequences, the film engages and offers much to enjoy in the quality of its director and cast, however as a total product it doesn't come together. The uneven tone, the messy approach, and the inconsistent delivery aren't compensated for by the message or its importance. There is stuff to like about the film, but it is not as good as many would have you believe.",Null,3,7,9 March 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Enjoyable, entertaining, and slick with plenty to engage
","I watched this film a day or so after watching Wonder Woman, a film which had disappointed by how meh it all was throughout. I came into this one expecting it to be yet another by-the-numbers superhero film, but was reminded by it how well Marvel have delivered their franchise. By all rights, this film should be a disaster. It is the third reboot of the character in recent years, it is part of a massive infrastructure of characters and stories, and it enters a very heavily saturated marketplace. How then does it manage to seem so effortless in what it does?I'm not sure but it benefits from the confidence that all the other films in the franchise do. It sets out its stall well, doesn't waste time on an origin story even though it does start early with its character. It has a solid plot with interesting characters, and produces lots of good action with humor throughout. It is an entertaining film that justifies the cost, and unlike Wonder Woman, the effects are consistently impressive and seem natural. It is a bit too slick and polished at times; some jokes and elements are a bit too knowing for example, and the cast has far too many recognizable faces in it that really only deliver a few lines. All of it has a quality feel, but at times it does feel a bit too manufactured within an inch of its life. Well worth seeing though, and yet another enjoyable film in the Marvel universe.",Null,0,1,24 March 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," As funny and as sharp and as relevant as it was almost 40 years ago
","When US General Jack D. Ripper orders wing attack plan R into operation he sets his plane on an irrecoverable bombing run into Russia.  Powerless to stop them with the relevant three letter access code the President of America and his advisors plan to warn Russia as best they can to prevent as many of the planes reaching their targets as possible.  However when the Russian Ambassador warns of the doomsday machine  a machine that will destroy all life on earth in response to a nuclear attack things become desperate.  With one plane making a desperate run to it's target things look bleak.Now well respected as a superb satire on the arms race this is one of my favourite Kubrick films.  It is less cold than some of this later work and is genuinely funny without losing it's point.  The story focuses on three main areas of the attack  the military base where one crazed man launches the attack, the war room at the pentagon and the plane making the bombing run.  All these have comedy inherent in them  although thew war room is by far the best.  The story is an satire on the futility and danger of the nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue.  It may not sound funny but trust me  it is.The characters are all great and well done by the cast.  Peter Sellers excels in each of his roles and shows his quality.  As Mandrake he is funny in a very British way, as The President he has great one sided conversations with his Russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including the legendary `Gentlemen you can't fight in here  this is the war room'. However as Dr Strangelove he is hilarious  the character himself is a swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies.  Sterling Hayden is great as General Ripper  he delivers his madness with a straight face throughout (or maybe no-one told him it was a comedy!).  Slim Pickens is good and has the most famous scene from the film that has been copied in many things including Homer's fantasy in The Simpsons.  However for me the standout is George C. Scott  not exactly a comedy actor he is frantic and over the top with his communist paranoia.Overall this is a classic and deserves to be.  It is sharp today as it was then and even more relevant.  The comedy is still fresh and the dialogue is great  quite simply, when Scott implores the president to act quickly as `we must not have a mineshaft gap!' then you've arrived!",Null,103,169,9 June 2002
The Beach," Looks good but is a little hollow when it comes down to it
","American back packer Richard is one of millions of travellers all looking for an unique experience.  When in Bangkok he meets the slightly deranged Daffy who leaves him with stories and a map to a beach on a remote island that can't be seen from the sea.  Taking with him 2 French travellers, Richard sets out to reach the island and finds it inhabited by a mix of people living as a small ideallic community.  However internal conflicts rise up with their arrival and a copy of the map that he gave to some friends threaten to expose the paradise community for it's darker roots.While I know that the critics were a little hard on this film when it came out, my main reason for not going to see it was a feeling of total apathy towards it.  I wasn't interested in the story, have never read the book and didn't feel I had to see it because of either the big name star or the famous British team behind it.  On television (for free) though, is a different matter and I gave it a go.  Firstly the film does look great; I know there are tales of environmental damage to the area but it does look like paradise and is very lush.  Director Boyle's direction is visually good too  whether it be drawing style from scenes or contrasting the city with the island or doing imaginative things like computer game style images, he does work well.The plot is good on paper but isn't as well brought through.  Richard's journey and initial settling into the island is involving and interesting but the main plot is really in the second half which is also where it becomes a weaker film. The film clearly is building into a teenage Hearts of Darkness type story where the DIY civilisation leads to cruelty and madness  this aim can be seen in an early scene where tourists sit watching Apocalypse Now in a waiting area.  However his descent into madness is less well done and less convincing than Brando's.  It all happens to quickly and, although with brutal consequences, it really needed to be seen to be more of a gradual distancing from the norm rather than a sudden leap into an abyss.DiCaprio is not an actor that I particularly like or enjoy to watch but he is pretty good here.  The fact that this film did as well as it did (in terms of box office) is probably mostly down to his star power, but he also gives a good performance.  His madness is well portrayed and it's not his fault the film requires him to suddenly switch the way he does.  Swinton is better as Sal, her `madness' is more subtle and is continual rather than sudden.  The mix of multinational unknowns in the support roles are all good  even if, with so many good looking young people, it does feel a little like a music video shoot at times.Overall I enjoyed the film even if it never got as involving as I hoped it would.  The story lacks punch and point  a fact that can be seen in a very weak ending which was a real wash out in my opinion  but it is still good enough to watch once.  The whole thing looks great and DiCaprio's star power and charisma helps keep the audience with him, it's just that the actual story doesn't quite have the rich feeling or depth that the tourist-film location does.",Null,84,113,1 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Muppets in space! A good film but weak by comparison with the two before
","Han Solo has been captured by Jabba the Hutt, but C3P0 and R2D2 come to rescue him with some other help too.  Once free from Jabba, Han joins with the Rebels to prepare to launch an attack on an all new Death Star being produced.  Luke goes for further Jedi training with Yoda but is later captured by Vader himself. Battles rage in space but also on the moon of Endor as the Rebels try to prevent the Empire taking over the Galaxy.This should have been the best of the series  the Jedi striking back after getting a kicking in part 5.  Indeed the battles and plotting suggests that it could have been.  Certainly the final confrontation between Luke and Vader could have been even better than the end of part 5, however it just doesn't feel as good as it could have been.The focus is very much on Luke and how he has changed since his discovery of this father.  Now he is dressed all in black and seems more ruthless than before.  This is explored reasonably well but it isn't as dark as it should have been  I never really believed that Luke could go to the Dark Side. The rest of the story is spoilt by one thing  Muppets.  This was supposed to be the big climax of the `three' films, we get that but we also have lots of puppets.  The Ewoks are OK as characters but the whole film has far too many puppets in it to be good.  Coming off the back of a much darker empire, Jedi is like walking out of a dark place into the light  it's just too bright and cheerful.  It should have had layers.Hamill is good as Luke but I wanted more depth  that said was good here but not as good as in Empire.  If you watch his three films together then you see him change which makes you appreciate him more.  Ford has little to do  it's like we've seen his space cowboy act before.  Fisher is the same but has more to do.  Ian McDiarmid is good  but again I appreciate his character even more now that I've seen parts one and two.  Yoda is cool but after Empire his screen time seems cut down (mind you part 2 made up for that).  Darth Vader is interesting  it's a bit sad but how many other characters have been played by three people (at the same time  not at different ages).  Vader's body is Prowse, his voice is Jones and his face is Shaw.Overall this is good  simply because it's a Star Wars movie and has plenty of action and thrills.  The muppets and brighter mood stop it being as good as the two before but at least now the Phantom Menace has shown us what a bad Star Wars film is like, now we know that Jedi isn't the weak link in the series.",Null,9,20,30 June 2002
Fast & Furious 6," Knows its audience and works well as a result
","There is something for films that know their place in life. Sometime blockbusters will try and dress themselves up as something more worthy or important than they are but with this sixth film there is no risk of that accusation being made about the Fast & Furious franchise, because this film certainly is no under no illusions about what it needs to do. As a result we get a very simple crowd pleasing film with plenty of big ridiculous action, very easy characters and plotting and plenty to look at. This isn't to say that it isn't nonsense or that it performs in any way other than the very limited parameters it sets for itself, but at least it is honest with itself and the viewers.To speak of the strengths first, the action is not only well executed but it is also enjoyably silly in how OTT it is. At times it hurts itself by trying to make a serious moment out of a ridiculous one (such as Dominic's mid-air Matrix moment with Letty) but mostly it goes big and doesn't do anything to hide that it is just having fun and we should too. The plot really only exists to create some frame for the action and to be honest the film could have benefited from losing 20 minutes of plotting and making more room for more of what it does best. There are too many scenes of discussion between characters; in a normal film I may complain about action pushing these out, but here I think more should have been cut as really I cared for nobody and it added nothing. The plot is also full of nonsense; the 25 mile long runway is the one that people mention, but there is loads of stuff that makes no sense but mostly, like the runway, you go with it because it is dumb fun.The cast are best when they remember this too – but too often the material pushes them to try and 'act' and few of them can. Diesel continues to lack charisma but in a way it is nice he has found something to do. Likewise Walker, not a man with much range, he seems very at home in this franchise and he is pretty I guess. Johnson is a walking mountain who has a lot of charisma and presence even though his character makes no sense. Gibson is fun, Luda is so-so and Kang is fine but oddly tragic throughout. In terms of the female roles, although there was still some gratuitous shots of models, there seemed to be fewer and less of a sense of objectifying. Rodriguez is OK but I liked the presence of Carano – not much of an actress but good physical presence. Gadot is gorgeous while Brewster is wisely left out of it as the abundance of character baggage is obvious.This is not a good film by any means – it is ridiculous in its action and really doesn't care about the plot at all, but if you feel the same way then there is much to enjoy. It could easily have lost 20 minutes of narrative and be been for it, but when the action is going on it is very easy to switch off the brain and enjoy it. Yes it is aiming its sights low and simple, but sometimes it is nice when a film is honest with you and then delivers all it promises.",Null,0,4,14 September 2013
The Expendables," Solid boys-own action but could have done with a few more thrills and a bit more in the way of comic relief
","With the cast it had it was no surprise that The Expendables was being hyped long before it arrived in cinemas anywhere. 'Could it be the greatest action movie ever?' some magazines breathlessly asked themselves, assuming perhaps that the cast could somehow just produce a good film by virtue of all just being in it. The answer of course is 'no' and I doubt anyone expected it to be any other answer. However the real question was can the film produce the boys-only, 1980's action movie fun that the 2010 summer season needed. The answer to this question turned out to be 'sort of' because The Expendables has plenty to enjoy about it but yet somehow falls short of what it could have been.The plot is essentially a small group of mercenaries heading into a tropical island in order to take out the dictator and his ex-CIA puppet-master: so far, so 'one man against endless ethnic army' 80's style plotting. And indeed so it is, complete with unnecessary violence and overblown physical actions and seemingly indestructible heroes. It plays out just the way you expect it to do and those looking for action sequences will enjoy the many fights and scenes where everything blows up (Terry Crews in particular demonstrating to the world why Infinity Ward were out of their minds to make the AA-12 a 'secondary' weapon in Modern Warfare 2!). The downside of the action is that, while it is enjoyable, it doesn't deliver enough of two key things.The first of these is genuine thrills. It comes close and there are good moments but generally you find yourself sitting back watching the mayhem for the sake of mayhem, whereas I would prefer to be sucked into and really gripped by the action - I wasn't really here; instead most of the action is of the video game style – where the enemy just keeps spawning in front of you and getting chopped down by powerful weaponry. The second thing that isn't as prevalent as I wanted was comedy. We get the odd bit here and there, but really Jet Li's 'because I'm small' speech is probably the high point. What was needed was more comedy mixed in with the action. There were a few kiss-off lines but nothing memorable or even 'good'. These are important because it makes the excess easier to enjoy as just part of a fun package – the film not having enough suspense or thrills makes the lack of this 'fun' all the more obvious and notable of a gap.The cast do help though and not just in terms of having big names in there. They do have an easy charisma between them and they all play off each other well – whether it be Stallone and Statham or the brief cameos from Willis and Swarzenegger. Crews isn't used particularly well but otherwise I liked everyone else in it, even if there were probably too many of them to really do much with – I thought it was a good move, despite appearing to be an ensemble piece, to put most of the focus on two of them rather than spreading it evenly around. Of course looking at it fairly, the film is not great – the plot is obvious and full of 'groan' moments that we have to have simply because of the genre plus it is hard to shake the feeling that the film is more for the stars benefit than it is about the viewers, like perhaps they enjoyed it more than I did? Overall though The Expendables is a solid enough 80's style action movie that does everything you expect it to do but nothing more. Personally I preferred The Losers to this simply because it delivered action and comedy blended well to make for an enjoyably silly actioner, whereas this doesn't really do that and perhaps takes itself a little too seriously for its own good. A solid genre film and enjoyable as that, but it doesn't do enough to justify the sheer volume of big names in it.",Null,10,15,18 November 2010
Scary Movie 2," Unfunny, crude, puerile and obvious nonsense that will please dumb teens but nobody else
","As part of an experiment into the existence of an afterlife, Professor Oldham brings a collection of teenage massacre survivors to an old house on a hill where a year earlier there was supposedly a violent exorcism. The group get together at the house and sit for a meal  but the work of housekeeper Hanson puts them off a bit and sees them all go off for an early night. During the night the presence of a supernatural presence is evident and is gradually getting more violent. With Oldham's assistant pleading with him to end the experiment early, the others start to twig that their lives might just be in danger.Some how or other this series has now reached four parts and, although I'll acknowledge that part 3 was an improvement on the first film, the second one is just as crude and stupid as the first. Sadly this really put me off and I honestly felt like giving up having watched a poo joke followed by loads of fake vomit in the first, very obvious, five minutes. Sadly this is followed by loads of very obvious spoofs very loosely held together in the 'haunted house' plot but mostly it is loads of penis and sperm jokes that were not funny and were actually pretty unpleasant to watch  not something I wanted from a supposed comedy. It gets no better and I can't remember laughing once, it relies far too much on gross-out stuff that I just found puerile and painful  but I suppose that if you like that sort of then this will do the joke  I don't and this didn't.The cast match the material by being sick and childish. For many of them I can understand why they are happy to work at this level but I can only assume that James Woods got a massive wodge of cash in exchange for demeaning himself in the opening scene. Faris is weak and the Wayans brothers are uninspiring and obvious. Hall and Robertson are both sexy but this is all they are used for. Elliott is gross and not funny while Curry turns in a very simple lecherous performance. Nobody is able to lift the material and everyone just swims (literally) in all the bodily fluid gags.Overall a dreary and crude film that I didn't find funny once. Maybe I'm getting older but I didn't even find it offensive  just puerile. The cast can't do anything to make it better and generally the whole thing falls down thanks to the low aims of the Wayans brothers as writers and director; they are happy with the lowest common denominator and they aim right for it.",Null,4,8,19 April 2006
MASH," An enjoyable, episodic comedy but not the classic many claim it to be
","And then there was Korea.  In an understaffed and overstretched medical camp Lt Col Blake puts an order in for more surgeons.  Dispatched to him in a stolen army jeep are Captain's Hawkeye Pierce and Duke Forrest who immediately start chasing the nursing staff and annoying their tent mate Major Burns.  When chest cutter Trapper John McIntyre joins them in the camp it starts a working practice that ignores authority and tries to find as much fun as possible in the middle of their bloody war.I had watched the TV show for a long time before I finally got to watch the movie - I prefer the cynical comedy of the film although I have always loved the more sitcom style approach of the series.  Many critics have hailed this as an anti-war film that exposes the brutal effects of war; to some extent I suppose that is true but it is far from being a part of the main narrative - even to call it a theme would be generous! It does have some scenes of blood and gore but it is far from having anything substantial to say about the cruelty of war.Instead I always find this film to be a very episodic, freewheeling comedy, some bits of which work and some others don't.  On the whole it is pretty funny and uses the sort of sporadic dialogue and action to move it forward. At times it is based on imaginative banter between Trapper and Hawkeye and at others it is out and out slapstick such as the chaotic game of American football at the end of the film.  The downside of this is that sections of it just don't work - Painless Paul's dilemma is pretty uninspiring at least - however, on the whole it is energetic and very funny.  Altman's use of overlapping dialogue and his usual use of overlapping scenes as opposed to a traditional narrative flow is good here but it would have been better if it had been toned down somewhat.The cast is what really carries the film - the plot is weak and they have no characters other than what they create themselves and, although the dialogue is good, I couldn't help the feeling that the cast did as much as the writers.  As such the lead two of Sutherland and Gould stand out as great comedians with great witty touches, their characters are the largest and their lines are the funniest.  Skerritt starts out as equal to them but quickly becomes a third wheel despite still giving a good performance. The support cast are all a good mix of characters whether they be played by actors such as Duvall and Kellerman or less well known faces such as Burghoff or Bowen.Overall, I am still unable to see what those who call this a `brutal anti-war film' see but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as a comedy.  As such though, it is very episodic and really lacks a solid narrative flow meaning that any 10 minute period could be good or bad.  Aside from this lack of substance it is a funny, enjoyable comedy but it doesn't deserve the classic reputation that it has obtained.",Null,65,133,8 February 2004
Pan's Labyrinth," Not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006
","Carmen has married Captain Vidal and, pregnant with his son, travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man, perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the 'smallest cinema on earth' (it wasn't but it must have been close). Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which, contrary to the marketing, is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging real-world horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where, like the real world, she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but, as much as I want to see this, it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story (although less so the real parts) and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the 'horror' part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door (in the UK this was rated a 15). At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story (again specifically the fantasy).By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue (albeit subtitled) interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything. I also liked the references scattered across the narrative, such as Alice in Wonderland to name one in particular. He directs his cast well too, drawing a very good performance from Baquero in the central role. López could have hammed it up but, while he doesn't really make a person here, he avoids being a pantomime baddie. Verdú is strong as Mercedes while Gil is good but left with little to do outside of suffer and worry. Jones does well within his creatures to deliver the potential within the design.Overall then not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006. Visually impressive and very well delivered, I'm afraid I just found it hard to get over the disconnect between the two aspects of the story no matter how much I wanted to find it.",Null,48,82,24 January 2007
Final Destination 2," I probably missed the point but I found this generally lazy and quite offensive
","One year on from the events that followed the destruction of Flight 180, Kimberly Corman and her friends are on a trip. On the road Kimberley has a vision of a horrific pile up and stops her car, blocking the access road. When the accident occurs Kimberley survives and has saved many other drivers. However when the survivors start to die in mysterious circumstances, Kimberley contacts Clear Rivers who survived the 180 flight and finds that death is coming after each of them in turn.I saw this with family and had no voice in the choice. I only semi-enjoyed the first film and couldn't see this being any better. The start of the film (i.e. the crash) is powerful and pretty well done - it is horrific, scary and very unsettling. However after this the film settles back into the rut it was in the second half of last time. In place of genuine scares the film goes for gore by killing each person in increasingly unlikely and gory ways. If this is your thing then you'll enjoy it, however I wanted more than just effects and gore. There is no tension and no scares - as a horror it works in terms of gore but nothing else.The characters are simply meat and nothing more - the film could have been 15 minutes long by cutting out all the pointless plot and just having the death scenes together. I felt no interest in any of these people and the majority of them were just given enough presence to make an impact when they were killed. I find this type of laziness really annoying - the makers just wanted the cinematic equivalent of a slaughter house, no substance or meaning, just a production line of body parts. I usually write a little about the actors and their performances when i do reviews but here it would be a waste of my time as no-one actually gave a performance worth talking about. They stuck in my mind only because of how they died. Only the Candyman added interest in a minor role.Even as a horror movie this is a messy failure. It has one good scene that is terrifying but after that nothing - just one more protracted list of red herrings leading to the eventual gory death scene. I found it offensive that someone felt I would want to spend 90 minutes watching people be cut up and killed in gory ways without having anything else to offer. No characters, no plot (other than a rehash of the last film), nothing new, no spark, no flair, no good performances, few real scares and basically a real lazy and unnecessary sequel. Like I said - I found this gory film to be offensive, dull and quite unpleasant to watch. Avoid it or you'll only be encouraging the producers to come back for a third one - and no one wants that.",Null,3,10,5 March 2003
Blade II," Enjoyable dark style with solid action, OK plot and good cast
","Having rescued Whistler from the grasp of the vampires and acted quickly enough to combat the vampire virus in his blood, Blade reforms his team. When his base is infiltrated by two vampires, he is offered a temporary truce that Blade accepts. He meets with the vampire council who ask for his help to track and kill a new strain of the vampire virus called the Reaper. The Reapers feed on vampires and humans, are immune to garlic and silver and threaten to rapidly multiple. Blade agrees to join forces but fighting alongside those he would hunt puts him very ill at ease.Opening with the same style that made Blade enjoyable, it is immediately apparent that, if you liked the first film then you should enjoy this one just as much. The plot has quite a few major holes but I can't help eel it's a little unfair to attack a vampire horror movie for being a little illogical at times! What remains is a series of fast and stylish action scenes, held together by a reasonable plot and a nice few little twists and turns to keep it engaging. While the plot may only be average it is probably the dark action that you came for and it is as enjoyable as in the first film. The wirework was pretty good, mainly because the cast members involved could actually do it without looking like they had become members of Thunderbirds! The CGI stuff is not very good and the computerised characters, despite looking good, don't look or move real and thus take away from the energy and impact of the fights. Director del Toro handles the action well and also brings the same dark feel that he brought to Cronos and Mimic.However generally the fights are good  good moves but still rather rough. Snipes has certainly worked on his body to the degree that he can perform these moves with a natural feel, only the WWF style moves came across as being rather silly or ill fitting. As a leading man he has really come on since reinventing himself as an action hero, and Blade is his best character in that regard. This film scales back on the complexities of his character and it damages the film a little bit but chances are that isn't what you came here for! Kristofferson is good but his character isn't really used well here. Perlman uses his screen presence well and he holds his own with Snipes. Varela is quite sexy but again the script doesn't use her relationship with Blade as well as it could do. Goss is very good in this role and it bodes well but I'd need to see him play a character (as opposed to a monster) to be able to judge if he has real ability as an actor  all the makeup also helped forget his Bros personae too. Jules is a very strange find but he looks good. Donnie Yen was, as he often is, poorly used  he has one small fight scene but considering the amount of martial arts action in this movie it would have been better to have actually used him in more of the action; wisely the film uses him better as the main fight choreographer.Overall this is an enjoyable action movie with a horror twist. The plot is OK and has enough to it to be engaging despite having several themes that it should have done more with. The action is solid and enjoyable and not too hurt by the odd bit of poorly used CGI. A good cast helps and the action flows reasonably consistently to produce an enjoyable two hours of dark style.",Null,35,49,16 May 2004
The Way Back," Solid story that looks great but is told with far too much reverence and respect – to the point of being hard to engage with emotionally
","A group of men break free from the security and barbed wire fence of a Siberian gulag in search of freedom, however the guards are very small beer to the real prison – the ravages of nature itself and the great distance which must be crossed before they can be truly free.Given that the focus of the film appeared to be one of endurance in the face of great suffering, this film is a bit of a hard sell for the casual viewer looking for something to watch of an evening; certainly for me this was part of the reason it took me a minute to decide to watch it. While it was an OK film, I'm not entirely sure if it was worth the two hours plus that it took to watch because it gives the viewer very little to engage with in doing so. The story is impressive in terms of the toll and also the sacrifice involved and accordingly the film wears it very seriously indeed. Hollywood excess is avoided and any crass sentimentality is absent, both of which I appreciated being omitted and restrained, and Weir documents the journey with a solemn air throughout. The first problem is that it feels like you're in a church – bowed with reverence witnessing things of importance but not really engaging with them because you're not really worthy. This feeling of worthiness really kept me at arms' length from the characters and the challenge they faced, to the point where it felt a little indifferent towards any specific one of them – not in a cruel way, but the feat appears to have been the focus rather than the people.This is still able to make an interesting film though, because the feat is quite a thing and, as I said, the film is very careful to do it justice and not sentimentalise or trivialise it. This is my second problem with it – it probably overdoes it in this regard considering that so much of the story is questionable. I try not to let 'facts' get in the way of enjoying a good movie because as a Brit I am used to seeing Hollywood twist history to make it more sellable to the mid-West etc. Thing is though, it is hard to accept that this is a good story when the film emphasises that it is true and also treats it with such reverence and respect for fear of getting it 'wrong'. Quite how one can get it 'wrong' when so much of it is in doubt is anyone's guess, but the film takes this route and it hurts it in the process. It still makes for a very sturdy film but there without caring about the characters or really feeling in their trial, it didn't do a terrible lot else for me and I was surprised by how much of it I was just able to watch with very little involvement other than my eyes and ears.One thing the film does do really well though is the delivery (visually speaking of course). The locations are immense and are put on the screen by director Peter Weir and cinematographer Russell Boyd in such a way that captures not only their natural beauty but also the sheer, uncompromising size of the places. It looks great throughout and I was surprised when I looked it up to find that Boyd didn't even merit an Oscar nomination for his work here (although it is an award category that has yet to give one to Roger Deakins so no surprise). It perhaps contributions to the 'look at this epic story' worthiness that the film has, but in the case of the looks, it is worth it.The cast also match the worthy tone and don't have a lot of time for character in between portraying hardship and perseverance. Sturgess struggles to really make an impression but he is OK in a central role. He is fortunate though to have Harris, Strong and Farrell with him, because they both bring presence and charisma in a way that looks easy. The rest of the group are good as well, but they also struggle to make an impression in all the worthiness.The Way Back is an interesting film that looks great, but it is also overly worthy and serious to a point that it is hard to really engage with it because it is hard to reach the characters on the pedestal that Weir puts them on.",Null,14,20,24 July 2011
Knocked Up," Doesn't live up to the massive hype but is still enjoyably fresh and funny despite the rather dodgy moral message under the surface
","Alison Scott is a production assistant on E! Entertainment who finds herself offered a spot in front of the cameras. She goes out with her married sister to celebrate in a club and there she meets the friendly but terminally unemployed Ben Stone and his stoner friends. Drink + music = a one night stand where Ben clumsily misinterprets an instruction from Alison and has unprotected sex. The next morning sees Alison faced with a curly haired, flabby man washed up in her bed and a brief breakfast leaves her in no doubt that she can do much, much better. However two months later and Alison is throwing up much more than she used to and finding she is pregnant decides it only right to get in touch with the man totally unprepared for the news that he is to be a father.Hearing about this at the time of release you would have thought that it was the second coming of the Messiah. I was in New York during its run in theatres there and could not avoid posters hailing it the film of the year and the hype continued when it arrived in the UK. Not really being into teen comedies, I sort of dismissed it and moved on. When it hit DVD I decided to give it a try and found something that is not totally worthy of the hype it received but certainly better than the crude teen sex comedy that I had the image of it being. What it actually is is a pretty natural and engaging comedy based around people who are, if not 'real' then at least recognisable. The dialogue is quite snappy and the comedy mostly avoids being broad or crude and on the contrary manages to be really well observed at times (the rather bitter woman in Alison's manager's office being a favourite of me and my partner).The characters do help and for some will be really recognisable. I don't really know people like any of them but the feelings and actions mostly feel genuine and real to me and I did care about them to sufficient extent that my interest was maintained even when laughs were not to be had for a bit. Speaking of genuine actions though, the one thing I would say that struck a sour note was the rather strange moral decisions taken where two people stumble into this relationship due to the child. I appreciate that it is not a subject for this film so much as a plot device to set up the story but it still didn't ring true to me and wasn't helped by seeing the topic being handled much better in Juno (where it was also not a big political message either). That said Apatow's script does bring out valid themes and it is these that see the film be convincing and feel quite real. Dissatisfaction in long-term relationships, fears, worries, the passing of youth etc are all there to be seen within the characters and, while not a searing comment, the film is smart and natural with it.The cast mostly respond well to this although it is clear that the vast majority work best with the comedy material. Rogen is not totally up to the task of leading a film, but he is funny if nothing else. In the more demanding aspects of the role? Well, I'm not totally sure. Heigl is charming and beautiful but almost to the point where the central relationship is made less convincing. I would have preferred a less stunning actress in the role as it would have covered for the lack of doubt in her character and also been more interesting in regards Ben's choices. Anyway, she is quite amusing and she is more comfortable in the more dramatic moments in the film. Mann is OK but Rudd is better. The support cast of stoners etc are mostly funny but my favourite turn is from Wiig who is wonderfully bad at concealing her tired bitterness while also going along with the bosses to keep her job.Overall then, Knocked Up is an enjoyable and fresh comedy that is funny while also having natural characters that I either cared about or recognised enough to be interested in. Not totally convinced by the fudged morality of the film or the way the central relationship goes but Apatow's script is funny and interesting enough to cover up for the weaknesses he has also created. Don't believe the hype but it is still fun.",Null,2,5,28 April 2008
Megamind," OK but too much plotting without enough heart and character and, frankly, not as funny or as child friendly as it should be
","I'm sure the recent subpar offering of Cars 2 eased their pain, but Dreamworks must feel the pain more than anyone else when Pixar give us Wall-E, Up and the like while Dreamworks give us solid animations that always seem to get close but no cigar. Reminiscent of The Incredibles (albeit in superhero theme only), Megamind unfortunately joins the ranks of 'OK but no Pixar' films in my mind as despite its obvious cost, it fails to deliver on its full potential. The plot sees us joining the perspective of supervillain Megamind who has time and time again been thwarted by his opposite number (Metroman) only to escape his jail and try again.The first most obvious problem with the film is the plotting – because there is loads of it. I'm not suggesting that it needed dumbing down but it felt like there was almost too many scenes where developments were occurring or things were being laid out and it seemed to push out other things. Specifically it pushed out time for character and heart because it lacked both of these. It is hard to describe perhaps but most of the Pixar movies seem to effortlessly bring a sense of engagement that makes you care about the characters in the film, with Megamind I was following the story but had no real investment in them. The second thing that was weak was the laughs because I was surprised by how few of them there were. I laughed enough times to justify the film as a comedy but again there seemed to be too much time where 'plotting' was happening and not enough 'asides' or comic aspects were put in – when they were they were funny but it was not often enough.The plotting and the nature of the plot also limited it in its appeal to all audiences and, ironically for a cartoon, it felt like younger viewers would be the ones left out in the cold. Not only does the time spent on 'things happening' push out other stuff but the plot itself is fairly dark and it isn't particularly made accessible for younger ones. The death of characters is the best example of this but there are others that were key to what was going on but would either be difficult or go over the heads of children – even my girlfriend turned to me during the film and said 'this better have a happy ending' (she is guarded about such things since I upset her with the animated film 9 recently).The film is naturally loaded with names when it comes to the cast and this tends to be the way with Dreamworks. In the lead roles I understand it but the star names go all the way down to smaller characters with barely a word to say. Ferrell and Fey cannot help but disappoint because, although their delivery is good, they are nowhere near as funny as they have been elsewhere, just not even close. Pitt seems an odd choice for a voice-only roll and indeed I can think of others who could have done a much better job with the rather hammy, clean-cut hero type. Cross on the other hand is more than welcome and has the delivery and the material with his funny support character, while Hill has character in his voice and does well also. I'm not sure though, for the value they bring, why they bothered Stiller, Simmons, Theroux and others to crowd the place with names.Overall Megamind is a decent enough film. The plot is good in idea but lacks heart and characters to bring it alive and engage, probably in part because it has too much going on and not enough time to let us care about it. Laughs are compromised too and, while funny, it is only sporadically too and all three of the children (below 10) I know who saw this were pretty bored by it. Decent stuff but yet again one cannot help but compare to Pixar, and things like the Incredibles that simply highlight the failings of things like Megamind.",Null,1,2,13 July 2011
Alien," Classic horror
","The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is 'born' the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level.",Null,245,346,16 October 2001
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Knows what it is and to its benefit it doesn't worry about being more than this
","Benjamin Barker returns to London with a hatred and vengeance in his heart that can only have come from lost love and false imprisonment. On his return he meets the crazed makers of the worst pies in London  Mrs Lovett  and a plan is hatched to use his barber show (now traded under the name Sweeney Todd) to extract revenge on those that ruined him. However as revenge evades him and his blood lust rises, his murderous rampage and his solution for getting rid of the bodies threaten to expose him or drive him to destruction  whichever comes sooner.It took me some time to get to see Sweeney Todd as it hadn't appealed to me in the cinema and I kept putting off renting the DVD. Whenever I finally did get round to it recently I was quite pleasantly surprised to find how well it worked. The reason for this is that it functions perfectly as a big dark musical. The musical numbers are all strong because they are the film rather than being things that the film launches into and they fit the dark, blood tone of the film as the music is constantly brooding and, even when it soars you get the impression that any hope or beauty in the music will soon be sucked back down into the mire. You can see what attracted Burton to this and his Gothic sensibilities are perfect for this. His crew deliver a great set and costume base for him to film in and around  it feels dark and awful but yet also has the sense of unrealism that the film needs because ultimately it is a dark musical fantasy and it has no business feeling 'real'.The performances match this as well because they are mostly very good 'musical' performances, rather than dramatic performances built on small things. That said, Burton does use the camera very well to get closer to his characters and give you views (both physical lines of sight and also insights) that you would not get viewing this from the floor. Depp is impressive and he gets the 'dark quirkiness' required  he looks the part, uses his face and body well while also delivering a great singing performance. Bonham-Carter is also good but her heavy 'cockney' stuff is a bit distracting and did get in the way of me enjoying her in the way I did Depp. Rickman is a great central villain  although he has little time his presence does it all for him. Spall I was not so sure about  his character jarred with me and I didn't think his delivery fitted even though he was trying to do the same thing as everyone else. Cohen was a nice find and an enjoyable part of the film while Bower, Sanders and Wisener all deliver strong performances despite their ages and the cast they are starring beside. Special note to Wisener as well considering how infrequently I see people from the Coleraine/Ballymoney area of Northern Ireland show up in things.Local loyalties aside though, Sweeney Todd works much better than I thought it would simply because it knows what it is and it sticks to it really well. This same approach will put off those who do not like musicals and the bloody effects may put off those who are musical fans but overall it is a Gothic musical with a rich comic vein running through it and it delivers on this.",Null,3,4,20 February 2009
Blades of Glory," Not as hilarious as I wanted but amusing nonetheless, and with some good moments
","In the world of male solo figure skating, two US giants are ahead of the pack. Jimmy MacElroy was raised from a boy with the single goal of being a champion, with the millions of champion-maker Darren MacElroy behind him. Chazz Michael Michaels is the opposite of MacElroy's perfect presentation  a rough and ready man with a sex addiction but yet undeniable talent. The two have battled for years but things come to a head when they share gold medal position. On the podium a fight breaks out between them and the pair are banned for life from the sport. Years later they are both doing nothing but getting by until MacElroy's stalker approaches them with a loophole in the sport rules  they are only banned from single events, not pairs.Undeniably silly this thing but yet quite pleasing at the same time. We have seen this sort of sports spoof several times over the last few years and the quality has ranged with some highs in Dodgeball but others not totally working as well such as Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Blades of Glory falls more in the latter camp as it is not brilliant but still has fun if you are in the mood. Considering the idea behind it I was rather surprised that it was not constantly off-the-wall material but mostly it had me amused throughout. The plot is straightforward but serviceable. The skating is outrageously silly (although some of the effects do push it) and overblown in a carefree way. The script does have some really good lines but too often I found myself looking for more than the dialogue was giving me.Ferrell is good in the main role and he works the fact that, ignoring everything else, he is still a very unlikely figure skater. Heder is very much secondary to him because of the differences in the characters but he is good value for what he gets to do. Arnett and Poehler do tend to steal any scene that they are in, while Fischer is an enjoyable addition. Fichtner, Nelson and others fill out the cast well. As with Dodgeball, I enjoyed the commentators and the script does make good sport of them, but I would have liked them to have been more a part of the film than they were.Overall though, despite it not being the most hilarious or clever thing you'll ever see, it does have plenty of laughs and did consistently amuse me even it did lack that many really good moments.",Null,2,4,28 November 2007
The Doors," Worth seeing once but it is sadly all over the place in many regards and almost totally failed to engage me
","Starting out on his poetic journey as a film student in LA, Jim Morrison meets Ray Manzarek, who he would go on to form The Doors with. With an immediate following and good songs, they get picked up by a label despite them being pulled off stage for Jim declaring his desire to 'f**k his father'. With their music, Jim's creativity and their infamy The Doors become big but Morrison himself becomes bigger and refuses to play along  bucking the system, getting arrested, upsetting the establishment, doing drugs and sleeping with every woman he can. However as time goes on he becomes increasingly erratic to the detriment of the band.Although I like the songs of theirs that I have heard, it would do others on this forum a disservice to describe myself as a fan. However I was interested enough in them to give this film a try, although the fact that it was by Oliver Stone would have been enough for me to try it out. What is immediately apparent though is that Stone has been overwhelmed by the supposed poetry of the period and the laughable idea that Morrison was some sort of visionary who was guided by spirits in his creativity  it is surreal and hilarious to see the constant presence of a Native American wandering around in all the scenes. It is this forced mysticism that really spoils the film, forcing it down our throats rather than telling us a story and letting us take what we will from it. The story is dragged out by scenes of drug taking etc and it makes the film too long for the material to support, making it dull  surprising if you consider the subject matter!Stone's direction helps keep it worth seeing, using different techniques to deliver a visually interesting (if slightly uninspiring) telling of Morrison's life. However, having given him that, Stone was also shoulder much of the blame for the major flaws in the film  the overdone mysticism I've already mentioned but even poorer are the half-assed attempts to take meaning from a childhood that we are told nothing about. The fights over whether or not this is a true story is one that I will leave to the fans but for my money I immediately discarded most of what I was being told once the Indian started walking around! After that stuff started to become a big part of the film I just watched it as a film as opposed to a true story. The music is all good and the recreation of shows are pretty enjoyable and, if not accurate, certainly felt of the time to me. It's just a shame that the films narrative is rather weak and just not good enough to make this an engaging film.The cast is deep with famous faces and most do OK. Kilmer does a great impression of Morrison's voice during the shows but outside of these he is lumbered with a sort of Jesus-like character as directed by Stone; he does try really hard and he is good it's just that I never bought Morrison as the person that Stone would have me believe he was. Meg Ryan is a strange choice and she works as the loyal, girl-next-door type but when her descent happens I was not convinced by it for a second. Support is generally good from MacLachlan, Dillon and Whaley, while the background is filled with well known faces  some in roles, some very hard to spot because they move so quickly. Madsen, Idol, Quinlan are the most obvious but there are a range of small roles (some extras) for Studi, Westerman, Kelly Hu, Mimi Rogers, Crispin Glover, Eagle Eye Cherry, Jennifer Tilly and Stone himself. However a busy cast doesn't guarantee great performances and, while Kilmer is pretty good in the lead role, it is the script that gives nobody very much to really work with that takes away from the cast  the film is about Morrison, having so many people in support just cluttered the film unnecessarily.Overall this is not a rubbish film it is just not a very good one. It's lack of involving narrative makes it feel overlong and the whole mysticism thing is a total dud that got laughs from me at several points  I don't know how much of the story is true or not but I'm content to believe that all that side of it is just nonsense! Stone directs well and makes everything look interesting (particularly the gigs) but his script takes away from the very thing he was trying to do. By the end of the film (when it arrives) I was bored and really beyond caring. If you really want to know about The Doors then there are plenty of firsthand accounts in books etc rather than relying on this film where Stone just seemed to make up aspects to suit himself. Could have been interesting and, although it's just about worth seeing once, it fails on it's potential and comes across as a rather confused and dull mess.",Null,4,16,10 June 2004
The Polar Express," Perfectly enjoyable little festive fantasy with impressive animation
","A young boy goes to sleep on Christmas Eve, steady in his disbelief of Christmas and determined to prove it all a hoax this year. His vigil is interrupted though by the arrival outside his door of a massive steam driven locomotive, The Polar Express. Tentatively he boards it with the friendly but gruff conductor and finds himself in a carriage full of other children heading to the north pole. With the mystery of what awaits him at the back of his mind, the boy and his new friends get into a series of adventures on the rails.This is a family film designed to be watched at Christmas in front of a warm fire with a family including young children. Some reviews have forgotten this and have made a big deal out of the weaknesses inherent in it. The fact that the animation was so cutting edge seemed to also suggest that perhaps these weaknesses were because the majority of work was put on the computers and not the writers but personally I do not believe this is the case. Lets be honest though, the plot is a simple one where a boy goes to the north pole to meet Santa (maybe), that is essentially it. On the way there are several train-based adventures and lessons learned.It is quite fun though and I enjoyed the sense of wonder and adventure that it produced. OK I'm not going to watch it with a group of my peers on a Friday night but that is not the point. The simple story fills the running time really well with the journey structured around mini-adventures to good effect. The message is a little bit sentimental but again it comes with the territory I suppose. The animation is impressive though. I think the claims that real actors will be redundant within years is nonsense but then nobody really thinks this will happen  it is just a way to get publicity through headlines. What it does do though is shore up the wonder by producing some great sequences and shots that would not be possible without computer technology. The cast is mostly solid although this is the same as saying that Hanks is good since he does most of the voices but Gaye was pretty good as well.Overall then an enjoyable little fantasy that delivers a sense of wonder across the story and animation. OK it is probably only going to work while on the home turf of Christmas but this is what it is for and I didn't have a problem with it working just as it proposes to work.",Null,0,2,27 February 2008
Malcolm X," Sadly one of Lee's flattest film but still a story worth hearing and features a good performance from Washington
","Malcolm Little was a young man when his father was murdered by the KKK and he and his siblings were taken from their mother and separated.  As a young man he became a hustler and eventually a full robber with his friends, before eventually getting 8-12 years in prison for his crimes.  While inside he learns the ways of Elijah Muhammad and coverts to Islam.  Once released he rises in the ranks of the Nation of Islam to be an uncompromising leader of the black movement , tackling white oppression head on.Lee does not want any question about the tone of this film.  Opening with footage of the Rodney King beating projected onto an American flag that chars before bursting into flames while Malcolm's `American nightmare' speech is played over the top, Lee leaves us in no doubt that this film will not step back from being provocative and incendiary.  Unlike many reviews on this site, I will not review the politics of Malcolm X but I will try and view this as a film.  I do not need to agree with the stance of X to be interesting in this film - I did not watch this film to fight with it or get annoyed by it, I watched it to listen to Lee tell the story of Malcolm X.Substance wise, the film is too long - Lee did not allow the editors to be as ruthless as he should have been.  I can understand why though, this was a labour of love and he must have felt that he needed that long to do the job. As a flow it works reasonably well, although it is too baggy quite often, but it is an interesting story nonetheless.  Many critics have lambasted the film for it's bias.  In that regard the only thing that surprised me was that they genuinely seemed surprised by this fact - what did they expect from Spike Lee?  However, I don't believe that this is a fair accusation to make at Lee.  He tells the story in a fair light - he doesn't hide the double standards of the Nation of Islam nor does he spin the anti-white teachings to paint Malcolm in a better light.  Of course Lee is going to bring his own pro-black politics to the film, but that is his right and he doesn't rewrite history to serve himself.In fact I admired some of Lee's touches as they actually produced a more balanced view.  For example, where Malcolm is talking to Betty about his thoughts on women, Lee cuts to Malcolm being told the same opinion (word for word) by Muhammad - a brave move that implied the spoon feeding of his views that I didn't expect from Lee.  Of course the other way to look at it would be Lee excusing Malcolm's stance on women by pinning it on Muhammad and in fairness to that view, Lee does tend to gloss over the NOI's view on woman's place.  The film is a little kind to Malcolm but not to the point where the absurd claims about bias and spin would really stick - well, for the majority anyway.  I did feel that, although it wasn't spin, that the final 5 minutes of the film really went too far with the little kids all standing up saying `I am Malcolm X', parallels with Jesus and then Mandella being wheeled out...now THAT bit I found to be unnecessary as it was not from Malcolm - it was heavy politicing from Lee himself in further evidence that he was knocked off his usual style by the weight of the material.In fact, this stands out to me as being one of Lee's least stylish and slick films - only the early, freer scenes of Malcolm's crime, drink and dancing seem to be directed by a Spike Lee using the camera and the space.  For the most part, Lee sits back and watches - apparently in total reverence of this subject and afraid to take away from the supposed importance of what the film is trying to do.  It is a shame because the overly long running time means that it desperately needed a spark at times and I did expect Lee at least to bring the film alive with visual flourishes.  Sadly, like I say, Lee's respect for his subject causes him to do nothing and, worse still, he includes some bits that just don't work - Muhammad's appearance in the cell is worst but Malcolm's trip to Mecca doesn't work as it is overlong and forced (again, as Lee stresses that Malcolm dropped the anti-white stance). In regards this, critics have unfairly accused Lee of trying to lessen Malcolm's stance and make it more acceptable (ie change history) but those of us who are a bit older know that we will learn things over our life and will not hold the same opinions as we did when we were 18, or 25, or 30. In the same way Malcolm lost his harsh teachings with age - this is the case, it is not Lee trying to trick us.For all these reasons, the film is greatly in debt to Denzel Washington. If it weren't for his engaging and powerful performance then this film would be very bland for the majority.  Happily then, Washington rises to the role and deals with it's changes and development really well. He makes a charismatic leading man and it is difficult to imagine that anyone else could have done a better job with this role - or that the film would have worked without him.  The names of those involved is impressive, but not all their performances are.  Bassett varies between being a shy little woman and having raging fights with her husband, in neither mode does she convince. Freeman is also pretty comic - but part of the blame for that lies with Lee's portrayal of him (floating in a cell is not a good look!).  Hall, Lindo, Randle, McDaniel and Lee himself all do reasonably well in minor roles but the film belongs to Washington and it is just as well for the film's sake that he is up to the task.Overall this is an interesting film that is worth seeing as an INTRODUCTION to Malcolm X - however if you take your opinion from this film alone then you are doing yourself a disservice.  As a Spike Lee film it is surprisingly flat and lacking in the usual visual style that he brings, it is a real shame but this labour of love is not one of his better films (although it is not among his worst) - it is rather pedestrian, overlong and, were it not for a charismatic performance from Washington, would be a lot duller than the subject deserved.",Null,19,40,13 April 2004
Nacho Libre," Mildly entertaining and distracting but not that strong, quirky or funny
","In a Mexican orphanage run by priests and nuns, one priest is continually berated by his peers and left to do simple domestic chores such as cooking. In his heart though, are dreams of more and these dreams are realised when he discovers the world of wrestling. Donning a mask and teaming up with homeless Esqueleto, they learn that they get paid even for losing their matches and soon set out to improve the lives of the orphans and themselves.Aiming very much for the weirdly comic approach that Napoleon Dynamite had, Nacho Libre takes a comedy sketch and tries to make a film out of it  and the strain is obvious. The plot isn't really strong enough to hold everything up but this shouldn't really matter as the laughs should be the thing that holds the interest. Sadly in this regard the film is not really that funny. It is amusing of course because it has an edge of imaginative and silliness that works well but it simply doesn't have the depth to fill out even 90 minutes. The character produces a couple of jokes and these are repeated once the material runs dry. I suppose if you can get into the silliness then it will make you laugh but for me it just seemed too basic to really be worth repeat viewing.Black is a big plus in this regard because he really gets into the character and does all he can with the simple script. Likewise Jimenez is amusing and works well with Black. De la Reguera is perhaps a bit weak but she is key in providing a bit of a foundation for the story. Hess directs with a good feel for the tone of the material and it works, if only his script had been stronger to have matched it.A solid follow up to Napoleon Dynamite then but not actually that strong or funny and understandably it struggled to find its audience. Those looking for quirky will have been satisfied to some degree but this is not a 'Jack Black' comedy as it was billed as the laughs are too infrequent but likewise the material is not strong enough to get by without constant audience laughter. Distracting but nothing more than that.",Null,1,2,12 May 2007
The Town," Solid crime thriller that works even if significant aspects of it don't
","There was a lot of positive press for Ben Affleck's The Town when it came out in the UK - a lot of journalists keen to write pieces about how Affleck had grown up and matured into a gritty and responsible director etc etc. I was fine with this as I had been quite taken by Gone Baby Gone, but ultimately I was still coming to The Town as a fresh film. Based on the book Prince of Thieves, I understand that Affleck's first cut of the film was double the length of the released version and I can only assume that there must have been a lot of characterisation and the like in this longer version because, although some remains here, the film is a fairly straightforward affair of bank robbers being closed in on by the FBI while also planning 'one last big score'.Although plot summaries and descriptions of the film focus on the side of the film that sees 'criminal with a heart of gold' Doug starting a relationship with bank manager Claire (one of his victims and a possible witness), this doesn't actually make up as much of the film as I thought it would – the majority of it is tension between the main characters and of course the robbery action sequences. This is probably for the best because the 'relationship with witness' aspect is probably the weakest and never really convinced me whenever the film relied upon it and the only time I really appreciated it was when it was a plot device or when it added to the film's main function as a thriller. This is a weakness to the film but yet it does still work because the thriller side to the film is solidly done and engaging for the most of the time.The action sequences are well put together without ever making the viewer feel like they are watching a Hollywood action movie – they are noisy and overblown for sure, but they are done in such a way that you sort of accept them as being rather low-key and gritty (although this might be as much of a comment about Hollywood excess as it is about this film). These are the heart of the film but the foundation of it all is the creation of this part of Boston complete with characters with low aspirations, thick accents and attitudes handed down through generations. In this regard it works well and the cast mostly deliver on it. OK they are still very much playing 'types' rather than characters but their performances are not limited by this necessarily. Affleck is solid in the lead, perhaps a little too sappy and unconvincing but he is still decent enough to do the job. Renner is better as he has none of this 'good guy at heart' stuff to worry about, likewise Hamm is allowed to enjoy himself without worrying about the details too much. Hall relaxes as much as she can and focuses on having sufficient chemistry with Affleck to make her character work – she can't make it work but she does the best she can with it. Notable names in small supporting roles point either to deleted scenes or to the pull that Affleck has – Postlewaithe, Cooper, Garber and a few others are in there as it goes.Overall The Town is a solidly enjoyable crime thriller with believable roots in Boston. Unfortunately not all aspects of it are as believable or as engaging because some of it just doesn't work particularly well and ultimately none of it matters as much as it would like to, but it does entertain on the way thanks to good performances, gritty presentation, solid action and an understanding of how the thriller works. Not as brilliant as some of the hype at the time would have you believe but still a decent crime thriller.",Null,0,1,1 May 2011
Closer," Well acted but too extreme, convenient and lacking the development that would have made the characters people I care about
","After a chance meeting at the scene of an accident, Alice and Dan start seeing each other and fall in love. When Dan has his photograph taken for his new book, he meets Anna and kisses her  starting a desire for her that continues even when a practical joke sees her happening to meet Larry. Anna and Larry fall for one another and start seeing each other while Dan and Alice continue their relationship. However desires, the truth and complexities in modern relationships all see things falling apart as easily as they first came together.Perhaps it says something about the majority of films released in the cinema these days but, whenever we get one that is dark, adult and edgy it is almost a given that the critics will fall over themselves to praise it and many viewers drawn to it will go ready to appreciate it no matter what. So it seems with Closer: an adult, bleak, dark look at the selfish and fleeting nature of 'love' that is deeply flawed despite being still worth a watch. I heard one critic say that he disliked this film because he just wanted to get up on the screen and slap all the characters for being stupid  I don't totally agree with him but the problem that made him say that (I think) is pretty much the same problem that I have with it. That is the narrative and the lack of development. You see, the film jumps years at a time without ever telling you it has  and it jumps from one 'complex situation' to another with nothing in between. Therefore, although much of it is well written and convincing, it is never happening to real people or even characters we know or care about it  it feels like you're standing in the street watching a couple fight, you have no involvement but it is of some interest.Like I said, a lot of it is convincing; yes these people are stupid in love, driven by desires and unlikely to ever be happy but then that is what a lot of people are like to a lesser extent. The exaggeration and the lack of inner development within the story combines to damage this and it does regularly lose this convincing touch because it goes too far or does things in a lazy fashion (the heavy reliance on coincidence early on is an insult to the audience). For example the final twist in the film is very interesting but yet we are given nothing to help us understand the character it involves or even care about it retrospectively. It is a real shame because the cast try so hard and are so good that it is hard not to like their performances. Roberts is very low key and, perhaps deliberately, underplays a lot compared to the others. Owen is the standout  playing a nice guy on the surface but much more just under the surface; it is difficult to 'get' a simple character sometimes but here he does this complex one justice. Like me, Law may not have totally understood his character and didn't cope as well with the complexities within him but still does well with the role. Portman is difficult for me to judge because I do have a lot of time for her and it is hard to be objective. I didn't feel that her character was well done at all but that she as an actress had done the best she could with it regardless.Overall this is a dark, edgy and adult film and it does make a change from the constant action movies and teenage thrillers in the multiplexes but these factors alone do not make it a fantastic film, even if it does make it an interesting film (it is certainly not a 'triumph' as the poster proclaims). The narrative only concerns crisis-points, sometimes years apart, without putting anything in between and it exaggerates things to the point where it is hard to really let them touch you even if a lot of it is pretty convincing and realistic (at least in the heart if not actions)  this leaves us without characters we care about and just performances to watch. The cast are roundly great but it is hard to really care about it enough. I didn't want to get up and slap the characters but the film was a bit like watching a couple fight  interesting, realistic but neither requiring nor allowing any emotional involvement from the viewers.",Null,11,21,17 January 2005
Battleship Potemkin," A gripping story told with style and passion as well as a 'must see' piece of cinema history
","With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",Null,105,119,19 September 2004
Elf," A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz
","Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.",Null,71,88,16 November 2003
Taxi Driver," A wonderfully engaging and convincing slide into a modern madness from a director and actor showing some of their best form
","Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night and just ends up travelling around. To try and use the time effectively he becomes a taxi driver. Things start to look up for him as he works nights and slowly starts to live a little bit. He meets a girl, Betsy, and arranges to see her a few times despite the fact that he is a little bit out of the ordinary  a quality that seems to interest her. His connection to the night allows him to see young prostitute Iris being bullied by her pimp Matthew and he begins to see his role to perhaps save her  him playing his part in cleaning up the sewer that he feels New York has become. However when his view of normal life puts Betsy off him he starts to retreat more and more into the night, looking for meaning in his life and growing more and more outraged by the world he is part of.Hardly the most uplifting of films it is engaging and impressive and truly deserves the reputation it has. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have produced a film that convincingly portrays a man cut out of society who has the slightest connection to normality before finding it eroded away. The script is brilliant because the detail is engaging but it is this descent into a very modern type of madness that drives the film forward. Travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy to go along with the rest of his madness. A major part of this is getting the feeling right about living in a cesspit; a city that seems to have forgotten its way morally  New York is the strongest example but elements of it could be parts of any city I suspect. In painting this world in such a real way, Scorsese has made Travis all the more convincing and, to a point, all the easier to follow in his fall. Like I said it is not a film to morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair. There is no redemption in this modern world and although it appears that the violence at the end somehow redeems Travis in reality by showing 'society' accepting his action it drags the rest of us down nearer the world that he hates and has become part of. I love King of Comedy for the same reason albeit in a different world.Scorsese injects a real understanding of the place and a real sense of foreboding into even the earliest scenes. He inserts clever and meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight and his choice of scene and shot compliments the script is depicting Travis descending into madness. What makes the film even better is De Niro showing the type of form that makes his recent form such a major disappointment. He is outstanding as he moves Travis from being relatively normal to being eaten up from the inside out. His eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as the gradual slide he depicts over the course of the film. Although he dominates it, others impress as well. Foster stands out in a small role, while Keitel makes a good impression as the pimp. Shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as the others so it isn't all down to her. Regardless, the film belongs to De Niro and although the quotable scenes are the ones that are remembered it is in the quieter moments where he excels and shows genuine talent and understanding.Overall an impressive and morally depressing film that deserves its place in cinematic history. The portrayal of a city and a man slipping into moral insanity is convincing and engaging and it shows how well to 'do' modern madness and the effects of the moral void of parts of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like 'modern classic' because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label.",Null,145,175,13 February 2006
Shutter Island," Overlong but engaging b-movie psychological thriller
","When a dangerous patient/prisoner manages to escape a secure and remote mental institution, US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner are sent to investigate. Arriving on the island they begin their investigation but find oddity and suspicion everywhere. As their investigation stalls and is hampered by those in charge, Daniels starts to realise that not everyone is who they claim to be, and that not even he has been honest about his motivations for leading the investigation.Shutter Island came and went and it got mixed reviews. My girlfriend watched it on a plane and disliked it, so it took me longer than normal to get around to watching it. What I found was a solidly enjoyable b-movie thriller which treads a familiar path but mostly keeps the viewer guessing right to the end. Those who have seen more than one film involving an investigation in a mental institution will not be surprised to learn that things are not what they seem, and the film does well to buy into this tone and embrace the rather OTT sense of reality or unreality. The soundtrack is full of heavy horns that compliment this atmosphere further. So in terms of what it is doing it all works really quite well but the problem is that it is overly long and needed to be tighter with a shorter running time. By being in excess of two hours, I was still held by it but at the same time it felt that it was a bit excessive and the longer it took to get to its destination, the more likely the audience were to be pulling at it to move faster.The performances are good. DiCaprio marked quite a 2010 with this and Inception, both roles that are genre films but with which he was able to do a lot more in terms of his character's psyche. Here he keeps the mystery alive and he takes the viewer with him really well. Support is strong from Ruffalo, Sir Kingsley, Levine, Mortimer, Clarkson, Koteas and others – all playing things close to ensure that there is this air of menace and mystery maintained. Scorsese directs with excess in a good way – striking images are used and I liked the way that there are no obvious visual triggers between reality and hallucinations/memories, this works well and I enjoyed the blurring for the viewer.Shutter Island is not a perfect film by any means; for what it is it is excessively long and takes too much time at the risk of the viewer getting impatient with its pace. However it does engage and it does work well with the material thanks to strong direction and performances. Well worth a look as a b-movie thriller despite the big names involved.",Null,9,15,23 January 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Plenty of entertainment and action, with a topical and involving narrative even if it isn't as smart as it suggests, and struggles with some character clutter
","The superhero genre is getting more and more crowded with different franchises, crossovers and solo films all coming out in a strategic package, so there is a high risk of the audience getting turned off yet another big empty film with just noise and indestructible guys falling from great heights. In some cases this is the way, that the selling point are the noise and special effects, but Winter Soldier remembers that it is important to draw the viewer in because if they even sort of care about what is happening then the film will be better for it. It does this by having a plot that is made to appear smarter than it is by way of being topical (protection v freedom), and then building lots of events and plotting around it, and, when in doubt, finish every scene with either a dramatic pause or an action sequence.It is a formula that mostly works. Okay, it is a genre film at the end of the day and the money is all up on the screen with great effects work and technical design which produces some noisy and exciting action sequences, but it is the rapidly moving and building plot that helps keep the viewer engaged rather than just pushed back in the chair as an observer. There is still an element of this though, and there are aspects of the film that feel too busy with so many characters coming and going, and so little time to really take a minute without guns and shouting. The broad topicality of the plot helps this but in addition the writers have just about scattered enough character and banter through the script to help that side too.The cast are part of this and mostly they judge their performances right in that they have to appear to be more than caricatures, but at the same time nobody is looking for great character development here. Evans is likable in the lead, while Johansson, Jackson, Redford, Mackie, Grillo and others all know what they are doing and by the sheer force of presence, they help the film feel more robust than it is. Most importantly, even when the cast do essentially just become special effects, they do not feel like they are.Winter Soldier is a big entertaining film with plenty of action and event, however it is still a genre movie and has its limits. The plot is not as smart as it suggests but gets by on topicality, while at the same time we have almost too many characters and plotting kicking around â€“ most notably the character of the sub-title is more about setting up another film and not delivering in this one. It still works though, with a good pace and action throughout, delivering good summer entertainment.",Null,0,2,5 October 2014
Capote," Hoffman is great but his character is so difficult to like that it cries out for a wider focus in the material, which it has but not as strong as I would've liked
","Truman Capote is an author and journalist who spies his next project among the stories in the paper  the apparent motiveless murder of a family of four in Kansas. He goes to the town along with Harper Lee to try and do an article about how the callous crime has affected the town but realises that there is more to this story than just an article and decides to write a book. When two men are captured and quickly convicted for the crime, Truman helps to get them better lawyers for their appeal in return for unlimited visitation rights with the two  specifically Perry Smith. While Truman wins the total trust and friendship of Smith, he also knows that for his own good he must get all he can from Perry to make his book as good as possible.With all the Oscar hype over Hoffman's performance and all the awards he is up for I decided to go and see this for myself despite not having read any of Capote's work or indeed knowing more than the documentary I watch a week prior had taught me (which wasn't much). The film opens with the aftermath of a cold and cruel murder and sets the coldly detached air that the film carries consistently really well. It is as much a presence as Capote himself and indeed the two compliment each other as they overlap. However this also backfired a it on me because the film never shirked from highlighting how mercenary and exploitative Capote was towards Smith; it may have made out he couldn't forgive himself at the end but by the standards of the Hollywood biopic redemption, that was very small beer. But by nature of Capote being so hard to like I found myself looking for a hook to the film; the story itself is good but as Truman is the focus he undermines it by repelling the audience. To counter it I thought the film would make more of the theme rather than the man by looking at the role of journalism generally in terms of being able to coldly report on subjects while also getting close to them, however although it did do this through Truman, I didn't think that it did it as well as it could have done.So for this reason I felt oddly detached from the film and like it wasn't sure how to totally engage the audience. That said it was still very strong because the repellent nature of its subject (the person and the crime) easily held my interest even with the cold approach it took. Hoffman's Capote is fantastic of course. Yes he has the voice down pretty well but his performance is more impressive because he gives a convincingly selfish and horrible little character that is still interesting. He plays him with such layering and conviction that I think he deserves the praise he is being given. Keener has perhaps a smaller role but she is as reliable as ever; as indeed are turns from Cooper, Greenwood and others. Collins Jr is oft-typecast in banger roles so it was good to see him in a better character and he does well despite not really being given the time to get to the heart of his character  which is fair enough I suppose as he is not the focus of the film.Overall this was a worthy if not easy film to watch. The performances are good and the subject matter intelligent and interesting. The nature of the main character makes it hard to emotionally get into the film but generally the interesting material makes it easy to get into even if I do think more could have been done with the interesting theme of journalists getting too close to their subjects and their motivations for doing so.",Null,3,6,19 March 2006
Life of Pi," Runs longer than it needs to and the spectacle hurts the substance, even if it looks good while doing it
","Life of Pi was one of those books that interested me and was constantly on my mind to read but, being quite a lazy man, I never actually got around to it. The story is one told to an American writer by a man called Pi Patel and it involves a ship wreck where the only survivors are himself and some animals which were also being transported on the ship – the most notable of which is a tiger called Richard Parker. Pi relates his struggle to survive, the things that happened to him and ultimately seeks to make the writer believe in god.Although there is an establishing period early in the film where we discuss god and then also see young Pi and his various religions, the majority of the film occurs once at sea and for most people this is the film they came to see. The posters, the awards and so on all point to this film as a spectacle and to be fair it is. Throughout all the animal sequences it is pretty much never unconvincing; the animals look real and look like they are right there in the same scene. Where bigger sequences occur they are also impressive and technically the whole film looks great. I saw it on 2D on only a television rather than the cinema, but it still worked apart from bits of personal preference – I never like those 1950's style scenes of 'poking audience with stick' – they seem in service of technology than story. Anyway, technically the film works.The problem is that it works too well. It becomes so much about spectacle that we forget all the work in the early part of the film – all that talk about god and ultimately Pi's statement that he will make the writer believe in god. This comes back at the end in a way that is actually quite satisfying because although not as smart as it thinks it is, it does make you think even if it is pretty bleak. The thing is though that this seems stuck on to a special-effects movie, not that a movie about religion had effects in it; so the irony is that the substance of the film really doesn't work as well as it could have done. The need to make the spectacle also means that the film runs much longer than it needed to do if you really were focused on telling the story.It is still a well made project though and the work of all involved is really up there. From the cast, Sharma is great in his first film – convincing in the emotional and physical sides. He is well represented by the older version of his character by Khan (although I did keep hearing his In Treatment character in his slow tone). There are other good performances in here but generally the film is all about Sharma and it is impressive that he isn't lost in the special effects or scale of the scenes. Life of Pi is a film that works best as something that it is not – a big, technically impressive, spectacle. The downside of doing that so well is that it is runs longer than the narrative actually needs and makes it feel like the substance is the thing that is a bit out of place in the film.",Null,2,5,8 June 2014
Over the Top," Has some good moments but is basically just a clichéd and sentimental 'father/son bonding' drama that fits in well in the daytime TV schedules
","Lincoln Hawk is a lonesome trucker who is trying to get his life in order having walked out on his wife and son about twelve years ago. With his ex-wife in a terminal condition, she asks Lincoln to collect Michael from his military prep school and come to see her  hopefully allowing them to bond at the same time. Despite the resistance from Michael's grandfather and a less than happy Michael not interested in his dad, the journey begins in Lincoln's truck. Along the way they win money through Lincoln's arm wrestling and gradually father and son start to develop a liking for one another. After Rambo and Rocky movies, Stallone must have seen this film as a way to showcase his acting ability with a more sensitive and thoughtful family piece but really this film is far from being anything new and is just a fairly clichéd and uninspiring sentimental drama. The plot sees a snotty brat teamed up with his working class father and, after initial reluctance, they gradually win each over. In each movie like this something needs to bring them together and here it is a road trip and arm-wrestling. The arm-wrestling produces some muscle-bound action for Stallone's traditional fans as well as being the plot driver. However it never manages to rise above the clichés of the genre and it is all a little dull and overly sweet.The film has regular 'pop video' moments that up the saccharine count without adding emotional involvement but at times the script does allow actual chemistry between father and son. A heavy handed subplot about Michael's Grandfather trying to steal him back seems out of place.Despite the sentimentality the cast do well enough for an average film. I've always considered Stallone to have determination if not talent; here he tries hard but he plays Lincoln as far too worthy and nice  the script even helps him by simply brushing over the reasons for him leaving his family in the first place. Mendenhall is rather annoying at the start but this is part of his character and he does work away from that well. Loggia is just there to provide a 'bad guy' to simplify the film for Stallone's fans and Blakely simply talks quietly in her few scenes. None of them really do that well  partly because the material is too basic but at least Stallone and Mendenhall have a sort of chemistry.Overall this is a fairly ordinary film that seems to be trying to be too many things but just ends up being a clichéd sentimental father/son drama that, 15 years later, has found its natural home on daytime television. Worth a watch once as long as you can accept it on these terms but otherwise it ain't much cop.",Null,1,3,23 August 2004
Ocean's Thirteen," problems throughout but the cool style will carry you if you switch off your brain
","When Reuben is double crossed by hotel and casino owner Willie Bank, Danny Ocean comes to see if he can appeal to Bank's code of honour and make him do the right thing. When this rather naïve approach fails, Ocean calls in his gang to organise an incredibly elaborate sting on the things that Bank cares most about  his money, his awards and his reputation.The Eleven remake was like a guilty pleasure  all slick and stylish but with no substance but yet still fun and effortlessly enjoyable. Twelve was more of the same but a messy plot did suck the life out of it and meant it was significantly less fun. I came to Thirteen off the back of good reviews, but then that was the same story with Twelve so I did have some degree of caution. Thirteen sort of sits in the middle of these two films, not quite as messy as Twelve but not quite as slick and fun as Thirteen. The reasons for this are many but I must stress that the film more or less still works as a popcorn movie that is a welcome sight after the parade of rubbish threequels so far this summer (Shrek, Spiderman, Pirates).The problem I did have with it was that it seemed a little bit less like they had come up with a cool narrative and then build around that with as many stars as possible. Rather, they knew the stars were there for it and it was a matter of coming up with a plot. Sadly the plot doesn't totally ring true because there is too much in it that I questioned. Of course the first film wasn't set in the real world but it had the pace and cool points for me to just go with it. Here the whole drilling thing was an issue for me and the 'con' was too elaborate  even by the standards of this film series! A little too much going on in that area does rather mean it sags as soon as it takes its foot off the pedal  even if that is only for a second or two. Mostly the material here just retreads the ideas from the first movie, but makes everything a bit bigger to try and make it have the same effect. It doesn't totally work as you can see the stretch marks on it and how worn some of it feels. It does lack freshness and it is telling that the only bit I thought was really quite imaginative and original was also pretty amusing was the wonderful absurdity of Virgil's part of the scam stalling as he leads a fight for worker rights.Of course it helps to have Soderberg on board as director because, as his own cinematographer, he makes the film look great and the post-production draws on this with great music and effects which really make the whole thing look and feel like it is being project onto the finest silk. Even when the material is weak (and at times it is very weak), the style and the slick delivery really carry it. Of course for many viewers this will be far from enough but, as much as I hate to admit being won over by style without substance, it does work here.Helping build this feel yet again is a cast list to die for. This is obviously a big selling point of the film but it does have its downside. Mainly this is in how little everyone but Brad and George actually has to do or say and this has the knock-on effect of making the film feel a bit like a red carpet parade rather than a story. Pitt and Clooney are great in it and show why women everywhere love them; they are slick and smooth throughout and have the lion's share of the film. Damon's material is weak and he was only OK as a result  he didn't convince with Barkin and why he was wearing the nose from The Hours I'm not sure. Pacino is a good addition and works well on screen without really trying  however it might have been more fun to give him the material and let him loose. Cheadle has scaled back his accent and also has very, very little to do or say. Qin is OK, as are Gould, Mac, Affleck, Caan, Reiner and a few others  nobody really ever threatening to steal the film. Izzard did well to get as many scenes as he did while Julian Sands managed to not be the kiss of death than he is known for being (although he was hardly in it) I thought Ellen Barkin looked great (not 'for her age'  just great) but the material given to her is weak as her strong and sexy character is reduced to stumbling around panting by some unknown chemical. Garcia wasn't used that well either but compared to the pointless bit for Cassel he is the heart of the narrative.Overall then, this is pretty much what I expected and I quite enjoyed it when it was slick and fun but it is hard not to see where the lack of substance is causing a void that sucks everything else back a bit. Eleven was a mindless pleasure and although Thirteen is not quite at that level it is certainly better than Twelve.",Null,2,4,15 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Mis-sold as a hilarious comedy where really it is a poignant character piece
","Bob Harris is an American movie star at the end of his career who travels to Japan to do whiskey commercials.  Charlotte is the young wife of a hot new photographer who finds herself stuck in the hotel room as her husband works. Both of them struggle with the different culture and language barrier, however they slowly get to know one another and find friendship in each other.The one flaw I found in this film was that it was totally mis-sold as a hilarious comedy.  On one hand this was to it's benefit as the film performed well in the cinema with the multiplex crowds, but on the downside would be that much of the audience expected to be laughing all the way - even to the point that some forced laughs at bits that were only amusing (I hate that!).  I had my doubts as the Coppola's are not well known for their joke writing and I was pleased to be found right but to find that the lack of the promised `hilarity' was replaced by a bittersweet tale of two people.The film is pretty slow and requires patience at times, but for the most part it is paced very well and is driven by the two characters.  The way the two find a sort of understanding between themselves is slowly moving and goes way beyond the rather clumsy jokes about how Japanese people pronounce words differently from us!  Both characters go on a journey - it is hard to describe as it is better experienced than described.  It is touchingly sweet and manages to be both low-key and intense at the same time.Director Coppola does an excellent job, even if her style is more suited to art house than multiplex.  The movement of the camera is very natural and nearly every shot was imaginative in some way - whether it be the camera movement or the close up framing of the characters.  She managed to give the film an unique visual style that I found very appealing despite the fact that I suspect it may not come through totally on video.  Coppola is blessed by Bill Murray in two ways.  Firstly, his presence alone means the film has clout and can be easily marketed as a `hilarious comedy' for the Saturday night lot.  Secondly, and more importantly, he is very, very good.  I wasn't won over at the start as he sort of controls the dry humour, but later, as his character grows, he shows a real ability.  I forgot he was an actor, I forgot he was a character, he just seemed to speak so naturally and from the heart that it was hard to believe he was only delivering scripted lines. I suspect the Academy will only honour him with a nomination but not buck the trend, but I believe his was one of the best performances I have seen in this award year.Johansson is equally as strong and does a surprising amount of acting with her eyes and mouth.  I loved her character and again, it was easy to forget that this was not a real person but an actress delivering lines.  Ribisi is always interesting but has little to do.  The support cast delivers the laughs but I must admit that it was almost a relief to meet Charlie et al - Japanese characters who weren't just used for laughs even if they weren't developed to go anywhere.If you buy the marketing and expect the onslaught of hilarity and belly laughs that the trailer suggests then you will likely leave the cinema wondering what the fuss was all about.  However if you go in with an open mind it is very hard not to be consistently amused as you get to know the characters and bond with them at the same time as the characters do with one another.  The end result is more art house than multiplex but it is all the best for it.  Warm, humorous, touching and very well filmed, Lost in Translation stands out of one of the best films of the year - and it's only January.",Null,5,9,18 January 2004
Doctor Strange," Distracting, with impressive effects; but no more than just an okay film
","Another Marvel film. It doesn't matter how many well regarded subtitled films I have in my queue, or how much I suspect that any given Marvel movie will have the same strengthens and weaknesses as the others I've seen, I will watch these quite quickly when they are available to watch at home. That includes characters I have never heard of before, such as Ant-Man, and this one. The plot here sees a talented surgeon get in an accident, lose full control of his once talented hands, and seek out some power that may be able to cure him. That power turns out to be much more than this, and soon he is fighting pan dimensional forces to protect Earth from destruction.There is plenty here that reminds you that you are part of a massive franchise of films, although to be fair Doctor Strange bares that weight pretty well, and mostly it just focuses on what it is doing and not so much on having a lot of connections to these other characters. Watching it as its own film, there is quite a lot to enjoy. The high-profile cast for instance; they bring a lot of quality even if some of them have little to do, and/or caused controversy by their casting. The special effects are probably the big thing though. Not only are they technically impressive (like almost all big blockbusters) but the nature of them is quite pleasing in the way it twists the world around. They are not enough to carry the film, but they do make a mark. Finally, the light humor works well, and helps it not take itself too seriously.Sadly, outside of the cast and effects, what we have is an origin story for a character I have no reason to be interested in. The effects may be impressive, but they also limit how I could connect to the action. It all plays out with noise and movement, but the familiarity of the content meant I never really got into it. On one hand this is what I come to the marvel films for – so on that front the effects, humor, and noisy action all were present; however, as a total package Strange was only an 'okay' film that could have been much more.",Null,0,2,29 March 2017
Interstellar," It doesn't all work, but it is beautiful in its efforts
","I'd heard fairly mixed things about this film, and often heard praise for elements that I think one shouldn't lead with, so I did put off seeing it until very recently. The reason for this mixed reaction I guess if that it is a very mixed bag of a film, and I can see why people love it, hate it, and a bit of both. The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever.To get it out of the way, there is a lot not to like about the film. It runs very long, and at some points this almost seems deliberate – like it has to be a certain length to be able to be called an epic. It also has variable pacing and plotting across this time, with some elements not making logical sense without even having to nitpick on technical details. However, while it doesn't all come together, the film is no less beautiful for what it does while it is trying to do it all. The visual effects are stunning, with believable space travel and worlds created, to the point that although a lot of it is technobabble, you do tend to go along with it and accept everything being laid out. Just as important as the technical, visionary stuff, is that the film has a very human heart throughout. It is surprisingly emotional, even when in the context of pure sci-fi elements; you do tend to buy characters as people, with their flaws, their pain, their motivations – it is surprising how strong the film is in this regard.Part of this working is that the performances are universally strong, although to just pick one – Mathew McConaughey is really great throughout. His down-to-earth elements bring the viewer into the film, while he completely nails the emotional content, which again helps convince us of the reality of the situation and passage of time – because we see how it hits his character, so it must be real. The director marshals all this in a feast for the eyes, heart, and brain – it doesn't all work, like I say, and it is far from being the perfect, flawless film that some would suggest, but it is engaging, thoughtful, heartfelt, and very well made.",Null,7,11,19 July 2015
Full Metal Jacket," A good (but heavy handed) anti-war movie that has an enjoyable vein of black humour
",A bunch of young men join a marine training camp to prepare for war in Vietnam.  However before they can face the enemy they must make it past the rigours of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Once past the training they face a war where many may not return alive.  They learn that the dehumanising effects of war run through every stage and are complete.This is Kubrick's most accessible film and I suspect that contributes to it's high rating on the imdb.  There can be no other reason why it would rank so high on it's own merits.  This is not to say it's a bad film but it is certainly not one of the best anti-war films ever made.  The plot is a game of two halves  first the training camp and second the actual conflict. The point that both halves hammer home relentlessly is that war dehumanises those involved.The first half is enjoyable pure and simply because of Emery's Gunnery Sergeant.  His is a witty character despite the inherent cruelty in his actions.  However eventually his screen time is ended and the film continues to make the same point over again but in a different setting.  The problem is that it hammers it's point home so heavily that it doesn't allow us to work things out for ourselves.  Even things like Platoon and the like allow us to work it out ourselves!  The film's strength is it's wonderful streak of black comedy that runs right the way through  it is the reason for watching and makes it feel a little different from other hardcore war movies of this ilk.Kubrick is always going to be watchable but this is not one of his best. His cold direction is usually excellent but here it is alienating and clinical when we should really be getting to like the soldiers involved. The film is still good but I felt that the flaws are too much here.  Emery is undoubtedly the main reason for watching this film.  He gives a great performance that is a mix of improvisation and script that works well and guaranteed him work in the same role for many years.  Modine is suitably wide eyed as our guide through his experiences but he is like most of the other marines  just blank characters for Kubrick to work around.  Only D'Onofrio (Pyle) came out of this as a real person.Overall this is a good anti-war film but not a great one.  There is no doubting the power of the message and Emery easily carries the film till the war itself.  It is still a very good film but I suspect that the fact that this is Kubrick's easiest film to get into explains why it is rated so highly.,Null,10,18,26 October 2002
Pacific Rim," Enjoyable monster movie that doesn't pretend to be anything else
","Part of the reason I have started completely sitting out the summer blockbuster season is that I just got fed up going to crowded noisy cinemas to be disappointed by films that promised much but deliver just basic effects and little else. With Pacific Rim though, it is hard to feel this way because it is a film that has never pretended to be anything other than a Japanese inspired monster movie where big robots hit big aliens in a way that pretty much never makes much sense when you think about it. The plot is explained very quickly at the start of the film and we then jump into the future where the war we just learned about is reaching a peak. From here we have some doubt, some lessons to learn, barriers to overcome but really what we have are big special effects punching each other. And it works.It is easy to wring one's hands and say that blockbusters are the death of film, but all things have a place as long as they are done well and this is at least an honest and fun film. I say honest because it has no pretension to it – it is plain and simple a monster movie with a very big budget behind it. The effects are good, with good monster design and generally a sense of fun and energy to the deliver. Of course it is just effects hitting other effects but it works for what it is and at least does this well – unlike other films that would aspire to more but yet can't even do this with any skill. The action sequences are large and fun throughout and the soapy drama doesn't get in the way at all. The film is loaded with references which I mostly got – the voice of GLaDOS being my favorite one.The cast are not particularly famous but it doesn't matter since the effects are the stars here. That said I thought they did a good job, in particular I enjoyed seeing Elba, Day, Collins, Kikuchi and others in their various roles. Del Toro continues his love of all things geeky with this film and in terms of direction it looks good, with plenty going on but never not being clear and engaging.It isn't a brilliant film by any means but it is a straightforward one that is honest with the viewer. Robots punching monsters – that is all that is promised and on that it very much delivers. If this sounds like your thing then this will hit the spot no problem.",Null,8,12,3 November 2013
American Sniper," The events driven approach limits the film to being a very one note and simplistic film and character piece
","I have seen a lot of Awards Season films in my years, and at some point I suspect that I will take the approach that I take towards summer movies now – which is to let them and their hype pass, and come back to those that outlive their publicity and marketing. However, with American Sniper I was intrigued to see it for myself on the basis of the reported controversy; with some slamming the film for glorifying someone who killed so many people, while others saying that the hero marks the life of an American hero who put himself in harm's way in the service of a mission given to him by his country. I approached the film open to whatever it chose to do of these, and curious as to what others were seeing, but the odd thing is that the reason that the film is accused of both extremes, is that it does both of them.As a narrative the film is events driven, starting in childhood, training, deployment, tours, and finally a return home. It is understandable in its structure and it is not its fault that these places and experiences almost feel too familiar now thanks to video games and films making heavy use of them as entertainment. The film focuses totally on Kyle, keeping the camera very close to him even to the detriment of other characters and situations. In a way this makes the film more engaging because we do stay involved with one person rather than the fog of war, but at the same time it also limits the scope of the film to his perception, his actions, his bottled up feelings. In this way it really plays it so straight that you can take it how you want to find it – which was maybe the aim of the film. So if you feel Kyle was deeply affected by having to kill women and children in a war without end, and threw himself into his mission rather than confront his own actions, then the film doesn't do anything to dissuade you from that; but if you think he was a square-jawed hero doing what he needed to do without question, then the film also gives you that. So the extremes of the argument get to be happy with the film – or unhappy with it (which to watch them fight, you would be fair to assume is the same thing).The problem then is that for anyone who is not coming in with an agenda to feel a certain way, the film actually does very little, because this 'straight shooter' approach provides very little of interest. Cooper does what he can with his face and body, while Miller plays it reasonably well; however it is all very straight and there is no nuance or room for thought or extension. In his direction Eastwood delivers good tension and action on the ground; okay he uses artistic license quite heavily to build in a specific narrative tension, but it works for what he wants to do. With his characters though, he cannot find much outside of scenes that exist specifically to perform that function – of which they are generally late in the film and as functional as they sound.There is lots of online fighting about who Chris Kyle was, what this film does, and what it is trying to say; part of this does come from the way that the film doesn't really take a stand, hinting at things, avoiding others, muddying other aspects to produce a mostly event driven film that broadly tells a tale, but never really gets anywhere close to the person, people, or place.",Null,14,30,31 January 2015
Glory," Worth seeing for the emotional sweep and impressive battle sequences that cover the somewhat basic characters (minor suggestive spoilers)
","Coming from a family of wealthy Boston abolitionists, Robert Gould took the opportunity to rise through the ranks to command the Civil War's first all-black volunteer unit. Childhood friend Searless joins him as a private in the unit while the majority are slaves, seeking freedom and the chance to fight alongside the white soldiers. Although there is no real political will to see black soldiers on the battle field the unit's training begins while Gould struggles with prejudices and resistance from his superiors and peers as well as from within his own unit.I approached this film with a certain amount of trepidation as I braced myself for a massive slice of sentimental revisionist pie. And in a way that is what this is but it somehow manages to stay just on the right side of things to make for an effective film. The plot pretty much writes itself as we go through training, see everyone learn lessons and eventually get to the final battle scene; saying it like this perhaps demeans the material but this is essentially what it is about. The script is weak when it comes to characters. Aside from Gould, the other characters in the regiment are all fictional and mostly they are stock characters that are mostly pigeonholed into easy slots. While this does weaken the depth of the material it does not limit the emotional sweep  which is pretty much what Zwick seems to be after. Lessons are learnt and characters formed and, although it is rather superficial it is engagingly professional.A lot of the credit for this belongs with the actors who perform better than some of their material deserves. Broderick leads the cast well although at times he is all a bit too dignified and worthy. His support is better in the regiment, which includes a typically solid turn from Freeman (was he ever not the 'old wise man' type?), Washington is fiery and engaging  a touch too modern perhaps but still with an effective performance. Elwes works well with Broderick and helps balance his character out a tad. Braugher shows the class that would later mark him out as being head and shoulders above his H:LOTS peers while the rest of the cast features turns from faces such as Gunton, Saunders and others. Zwick's direction in the battle scenes are impressive and it is depressingly convincing in how people are cut down. If I had one complaint it would be the sparing of main characters for the majority of the film; although I understand the cinematic reasons for this, it does rather undo the brutal and random nature of the violence. Having said that though, it is hard not to be impacting by the intense battles and the emotions of loss.Overall then an impressive film even if it is not one that I think deserves the amount of unquestioning praise that is lavished upon it on these pages. It does have weak characters and it is a touch revisionist and sentimental but it more than makes up for this by producing an effective sweep of emotion, an engaging basic narrative and convincingly brutal battle sequences combine to produce a strong film that is worth seeing for what it does well.",Null,5,10,23 November 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Amusing and convincing creation but the narrative is too obvious (minor SPOILERS)
","In an attempt to gain experience to try and get her dream job in journalism, Andy Sachs applies for a job with fashion magazine Runway. Naïve about fashion and seeing this all as just a filler job, Andy finds herself seconding Emily as the assistant of Runway's editor-in-chief, the fearsome Miranda Priestly. While Andy tries to take it all in her stride, she sound finds herself forced to buy into the world she now works and also running to keep up with the unreasonable and regular demands of her new boss.My girlfriend now has Sky+ and, despite the fact that she could tape anything and hold it on the drive to watch when she is home, she never does and the question still gets asked 'what's on?' to the answer 'nothing'. So in an attempt to have a library to dip into, I recorded a handful of films  one of them being this film. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have bothered with it, since I never did in the cinema or on video. Watching it I found it to be quite enjoyable in the same way as I had done with Ugly Betty when I could be bothered to watch that. What I mean by this is that the b1chy world of the fashion magazine is well captured and fun to view from the outside. Outside of this though, the film is not that strong particularly where it has to try and come up with some sort of plot to give the film somewhere to go.In this regard it does rather fall down as I cannot imagine anyone is surprise to see that Andy changes, hurts those closest to her and ultimately has to re-examine herself and what is important to her. It does exactly this and it offers nothing to surprise or challenge along the way. Fortunately the world of Runaway is amusing enough to carry the film and here is where Streep carries it along. Her performance isn't the most complex of course but it s wonderfully done nonetheless, making a strong central character. Hathaway is OK and does enough to act as the fresh eyes of the viewer in this world. Blunt is a bit too stiff but I suppose this is more her character than her performance. Tucci is enjoyable but I found Baker and Grenier to be creepy and wet respectively.Overall then a short summary of the fashion world that will save you watching the lacklustre Ugly Betty to get much the same. The plotting is weak and as a result the film can only be so enjoyable but the b1tchiness makes it an amusing distraction.",Null,2,5,3 March 2008
Rocky II," A good sequel that repeats the successful formula
","Immediately after Rocky's close contest with Apollo Creed, he is drawn into fame only to find it is a temporary thing.  As the money fades he finds personal crisis is never far away and is tempted into a big money rematch against Creed.  Meanwhile Creed, who should fight other fighters, is plagued by suggestions that the first fight was staged to go the distance.  Things build to the rematch.Stallone proves that he has got a money making brain in his head by basically remaking Rocky.  The story covers similar themes  it's a soap opera with a fight at the end.  Here the soapy mush is mostly about his loss of money and decline back into the gutter, while we have children and comas thrown in for good measure.  This is all well and good, and Stallone doesn't let it get too mushy.  The script has some good scenes and mixes in comedy  my favourtie line being where Rocky is advised to invest his money in condominiums, to which Rocky replies `condominiums? But I don't use them.'This comedy helps endear Rocky to us despite being a bit `punchy'.  The fight however  that's where the money is.  As in the first Rocky movie, the fight is a huge thing, full of emotion and welling music.  The fighting is, of course, nonsense  even sillier than the first film, but with the raw emotion and use of music you can't help but get involved  even if you don't want to!  At times it goes a bit far and may look a bit like ego-massaging by Stallone, eg the scene where he is out on his training run and is followed by hundreds of supportive children!Stallone is good in all his roles, the playing of Rocky as a working class bum made good is bang on.  Shire doesn't have much to do but she's good beside Stallone.  Young is good and Meredith easily repeats his tour-de-force as the grizzled trainer.  Carl Weathers is good as Apollo Creed and this is one of his best roles.Overall this isn't a classic but by repeating the basic formula of the first movie and taking Rocky back to the gutter, this remains an entertaining soap that is driven by mushy, if formulaic, emotion.",Null,38,50,27 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode 1 but so is getting kicked in the n*ts
","An attempt on the life of Senator Padmé leads to Jedi knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker being assigned to protect her. Further information on the assassin leads Obi-Wan to travel to a distant constellation while Anakin and Padmé go undercover to travel to her home planet for safety. While Anakin and Padmé begin to fall for each other, Obi-Wan discovers a factory planet producing a clone army for the Republic. With events appearing to be being controlled by powerful external sources the Jedi's find themselves faced with a battle against a further force within the Trade Federation.Basically think of all the areas where the Phantom Menace failed and write them all down  too dry plot-wise, too childish, no comedy or fun, poor characters, no drive, Jar Jar Binks! Now just imagine that Lucas had had a ham-fisted attempt at improving on them and actually did an OK job of it. Where the original Star Wars films got darker with the second instalment so to does Attack of the Clones. This dark element comes through in many ways. Mainly we have Anakin's shift towards the dark side as he begins to wander from the code of the Jedi by displaying anger, arrogance, impatience, lust. His descent into violence due to personal circumstances marks a dark moment in the film. Also we have the Jedi beginning to lose power while the dark side continue to grow in influence. This makes the whole political sub-plot much better than Phantom Menace where it was dull and going nowhere but doing it very slowly. Here you can see the strands come together as Darth Sidious continues to influence events with the help of Darth Tyranus. The fact that all the pieces are being to fall into place makes this even better  we can see actions begin that cause the situation in Star Wars 4, and we have the beginnings to things that will see the downfall of the Jedi in episode 3; this at least makes the narrative more interesting and, because it implies bigger things, more engaging.However this dark edge is tempered by a new concept to those only familiar with episode 1  occasional fun. The romance subplot is a bit clunky and unconvincing but it doesn't slow it down as much as the trailers suggested it may. Although the romance turns dark it makes for a nice contrast with Obi-Wan's more action story that occurs at the same time. The film is funnier for two main reasons  firstly Obi-Wan is allowed to be more relaxed and adventurous, and two  the droid versions of Laurel & Hardy return in the shape of the ever great C3-P0 and R2-D2. The effects and battles are better here too but still suffer from Lucas loving his computer more than he does his characters; however as a summer blockbuster to pack multiplexes, the action works well. There are some bigger downsides yes it all looks good but some of it is a little silly. For example the 'car' chase near the start sees our Jedi heroes falling through the sky for 30 odd seconds just to land on another vehicle with perfect timingI know they have the force but that's pushing it isn't it? Likewise other bits just step over the limit of what is acceptable as 'real' even in sci-fi.The performances and the characters have improved but generally they are still delivering lines as if they were quoting God. MacGregor is better because he is allowed to have a character instead of a totally dry cut-out like episode 1, but it is still a bit of an impression. Likewise Anakin is much better here (could he have been worse?) and Christensen tries hard  at first simmering with arrogance but later letting rage and frustration become his master for the first time; he is still a bit too wooden and a bland actor for me but at least he is better than Lloyd. Lee and McDiarmid make very good puppet-masters, while Jackson clearly enjoys having more to do than in episode 1. Yoda is good (despite looking silly in his battle) and given the part he deserves while Smits is really underused. To continue the 'cool bad guy' strand Morrison makes a cool Jango Fett  as well as allowing the film to carry through the themes of parenthood and family ties through his son Boba. Unfortunately Jar Jar Binks is back in this but at least the film shows some irony in the fact that it Binks that basically opens the door for the creation of the Empire and the fall of the Republic.Personally the main improvement is the linkage are not only being made with the events of part 4 but that they are now heavily up on screen. Although it is all a bit basic and simplistic (no time for complex thematic changes with all that CGI to create!) it still has moments - the most powerful for me is near the end where massive events unfold before the watching Jedi council and the music smoothly moves into the dark Empire theme tune from part 4  showing clearly that this is one of the major leaps towards the breakdown of the Republic and the creation of the Empire. It may feed off nostalgia as much as be a genuine moment, but it did work. Overall an improvement on Episode 1 but still a bit weak in many areas. It all depends now on the final episode (as it always did) to raise the level again and actually make a strong film that really lets the series go out on a bang rather than just making these new films one big bad idea.",Null,12,25,27 May 2002
Romeo + Juliet," Brave film that works surprisingly well
","In modern day Verona, two large-family owned corporations battle each other in the board room -the Montagues and the Capulets.  This family feud has overspilled into the streets where bloody gang warfare is barely controlled by a police force unable to arrest the members of those most powerful families.  In the middle of this violence is Romeo who is sad for lack of love.  When he and his friends gate crash a Capulet party he meets the beautiful Juliet Capulet and the two fall in love  even though her father is arranging a most profitable political marriage to the Governor's son. Romeo and Juliet are married in secret but their love is fated to be engulfed in the violence of their surroundings.In the past so-many years Shakespeare adaptations of one form or another are more common place for the teen market (think O or 10 Things I Hate About You).  However even now the filming of an update of a Shakespeare tale, using the original dialogue (more or less) would be an incredible risk  as it was then.  This could easily have lost those who love Shakespeare (because of the modern setting) but also alienated the teens by using language that is difficult to follow.  Also Luhrmann's hyper stylised direction is also so very OTT at times that it risked turning the whole thing into a cartoon.However, it actually works.  The film opens on shaky ground  the first 10 minutes pass by before you are allowed to settle into the film and see how it plays.  The actual opening is a great introduction and works well  with the heavy music, sweeping cameras and the introduction to the main players. However the confrontation between the Capulet boys and the Montague boys at a petrol station is too hyper and silly and risked losing the plot if it were to continue like this.  Happily this scene is the height of Luhrmann's directive flamboyance and, although there are touches, it never gets this frantic again.  Once the film settles the lines work very well and the film really does a great job of setting old fashioned terms (dagger, sabre, sword) in modern ways  even replacing characters like Father Friar with a postal delivery service called Post Haste!The performances support the film  if they can't deliver the lines convincingly and create modern characters then the film is lost. Fortunately the majority of the cast deliver their lines well  not always following the OTT direction to get OTT delivery.  DiCaprio is soft in the lead yet does well with the traumatic scenes towards the end.  He even looks a little too young for the role of a young lover but it still works.  Danes is almost as good but is less convincing in the more extreme emotions.  The pair work well together  my favourite moment being that when they catch eyes mid-death towards the end.  For once Leguizamo's cartoon antics almost suit the role and he gives a bearable performance  I can't stand the guy so that's saying something.  The best support came from Perrineau Jnr who was given the indignity of being in drag for a bit of the film but delivers his lines well.  The support include mostly well known faces and the only weak links are the actors playing the Montague boys (including Jamie Kennedy).Overall this was a very brave film and it is easy to look back now and think it must have been a sure thing.  The modern setting is used well once the frantic direction slows down a little bit 15 minutes in and a mostly talented cast make the lines sound alive.  Not a perfect film but a great updating of a classic tale.",Null,3,6,25 May 2003
Forrest Gump," A reasonably enjoyable romp through recent history and pop culture  any more than that and it's a crass conservative message (spoilers)
","Sitting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump starts to take to those around him and tells a story of his life to date.  His is a fairly unremarkable life that spans recent history.  It begins with his childhood in Alabama and his growth from humble beginnings to take part in many memorable events in recent American history.I saw this when it came out and have seen it several times since then.  I haven't reviewed it until now because I've always felt that my views of this film were pushed one way or another by a) it winning lots of Oscars and b) everyone hammering it in comparison to Pulp Fiction.  It should be judged on it's own merits, so I watched it yesterday in an attempt to do that.  I felt that I could view it in one of two ways  either as a comical walk through recent history or as a message.As a special effects driven walk through recent history it is actually quite enjoyable.  It does get a bit tiresome to see Forrest meet one president after another, or invent popular songs/slogans/tee shirts/ bumper stickers etc but it still works quite well.  The subplot of his love for Jenny doesn't work as well in this context and actually serves only to slow things down a little and to create the cheesy climax to the film.  However this subplot is the basis for the film's `message'.  Jenny and Forrest both start out in the same place.  Forrest works hard without questioning anything, sure he gets some tough breaks but his dogged efforts eventually work out for him.  Jenny, on the other hand, gets involved in the other culture of the times  be it political rebellion, drugs, music, extramarital sex etc. Her fate is less than Forrest's  she dies and realises on her death dead that she should have just been clean cut like Forrest.  This side of the film smacks rather heavily  first of all it is all too sentimental but, more importantly, it is a clear attack on the counter cultures and a condemnation of those that are part of them.Of course the film's humour means that the two extremes of Forrest and Jenny are also played for laughs so even a flag burning, drug user may be won over by the film before it starts to deliver it's message drop and drop.  I tried just to enjoy the comic side of the film but it wasn't enough to fill the 2 hour plus run time and I started looking at the sub plot  and didn't like what I saw.The cast are all pretty OK.  I don't think for a moment that Hanks deserved his Oscar, but there's nothing more can be said of that.  He does do good work to play his `dumb' character so well but it shouldn't really have won no matter who else it was up against.  Penn is OK but only has to play `bad' for most of the film.  Sinise is pretty good value and his character is a mix, with the bitterness writ large on his life.  Williamson plays another `dumb' character but does OK and Field is alright as Forrest's Mom.  To be honest the cast all match the tone of the film  all good people who just keep plodding along and get good results.Overall I should take the film to be praise of an America where even those with 75 IQ's can make it, however this simply isn't true.  What remains once this is rejected is the comedy of seeing Hanks inserted into archive footage (to mostly amusing effect) and a crass and obvious attack on those who would go against whatever America stands for.  It's worth a watch but the crude message and effect driven humour simply didn't help me understand where all those Oscars came from.",Null,34,69,1 November 2003
Gone Baby Gone," Complex, engaging thriller with strong delivery from cast and crew
","When a young girl goes missing from a rough Boston neighbourhood, the relatives of the less-than-sympathetic mother turn to private detective Patrick Kenzie who they hope can help with his local knowledge. Kenzie instantly does two things  one being rubbing the police the wrong way with his involvement, the other being proving his worth by exposing lies the police have been told by key people. However, with the clock ticking, time is running out and the odds dwindling for finding the child alive.As many others have said, Gone Baby Gone understandably took its time to get to the UK given the thematic connection with the real life child disappearance that dominated the headlines for many months, not to mention the likeness that the two white, blonde girls share. Going into it I thought that it would be a very bleak look at child abduction or child abuse and it was quite pleasing to find myself in the middle of a thriller plot  albeit very much about the aforementioned subjects. I'm not sure if this has been marketed at all in the UK (not seen a single poster for it whereas Hulk is everywhere) but if it has I'm not sure how they would have done it because while it is engaging, it is certainly not a cheerful or lovable film. However this is a problem for the marketing people  not the viewer.For the viewer what the very dark tone also produces is a complex and engaging thriller that not only manages to hold the attention with a series of solid and unexpected twists but also forces moral questions onto you that have no easy answers (although do have 'right' answers). The two aspects of the film complement one another really well, with the thriller moving at a pace that does not detract from how grim it is. It is not perfect of course and some of the plot turns do take the odd jump and for the overall scenario as you understand it at the end, asking too many 'yeah but' questions will take it to pieces with relative ease. Fortunately though, when it does tend to be weak in these regards, it is delivering questions to the viewer (the ending being a perfect example) and these rather serve to prevent one from picking at the internal logic but rather focusing on the question instead. Working this way makes it engaging and interesting to watch and it was a lot better than I expected.Being' better than expected' is also a statement that be applied across the cast and in particular to the director. Affleck does really good work here with his cinematographer to gets loads of well-framed shots along with the realistic ones but he also does very well in regards tone and style of delivery. It may be a 'thriller' but the development is slow and, when violence comes, the gun fire has an abrasive crack rather than the satisfying thuds more favoured in action films. He draws mostly good performances from his cast as well. Casey Affleck turns in yet another strong performance; some have said he is rather flat but to me his restraint and internal conflict worked best for the film. Freeman has a small role and is essentially the sturdy pair of hands he is now known as. Harris is as good as you expect and it is nice to see Ashton in something again. Oscar nominated Ryan really should have won for a really convincing turn as the mother of the missing child but Monaghan is sadly not as good as she could have been and didn't work for me at key parts. Ironically the main cast member that stood out for me was one that did so in a jarring way, and that was Williams. We are treated to several lingering shots of his character before his name is even known (far less his minor part in the narrative) and I wondered why he was focused on like that. I imagine most people will not notice but it is hard enough to forget he is Omar from The Wire without having unnecessary shots of him.Anyway, before I start going on about The Wire again (watch it folks) I should note that Gone Baby Gone was not only better than I expected but also very good on its own terms. The narrative has weaknesses but these are helped over by the thread of moral questioning and how engaged I was in the overall film. The delivery is surprisingly good from Affleck as director and the cast is good with only a very few exceptions. Hard to market and not the most fun film you'll see but worth seeing regardless.",Null,4,6,2 July 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," There's more for kids than adults, but it's still got plenty of laughs for adults
","Monsters Mike Wazowski and Sulley are the best scare team in Monsters Inc. The company catches the screams of children to power the city of Monstropolis.  However Sulley's main rival, Randall Boggs is up to no good and is working the rooms after the factory is shut.  Sulley stays late one night to find a door has been left open and that a highly dangerous little girl gets trapped on the wrong side of the door.  With the contamination unit closing in on them, Mike and Sulley must get the girl back into her room and uncover Randall's plot.From the Toy Story producing Pixar comes yet another child/adult cartoon. The story here will satisfy adults and children but it feels like an excuse for things to happen rather than a story in itself.  Where Toy Story had layers of story this is quite straightforward.  That's not to say it's not good, but it is more aimed towards the children than the adults.Similarly the majority of the comedy is aimed at children.  The only consistent laughs for adults come from the original `one-eyed monster' (where was that joke!?) Mike - he delivers plenty of funny lines and his musical over the outtakes is the funniest thing in the whole film.  The problem is that it doesn't have Toy Story's spread of backup characters to deliver one-liners, here we have the three main characters and a couple of baddies, other than that there are no really good support roles - even Celia is wasted as Mike's love interest.There are still more laughs than many real comedies!  But it's unfortunate that it's only left to Mike to carry the adult humour.  The animation here has really advanced from Toy Story - just check out Sulley's hairy coat to see the detail.  At times you forget it's a cartoon - the characters and backgrounds just look so very real.  The final chase through the many doors of the factory is really exciting visually and is pleasing to all.A great voice cast includes Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, Buscemi, and Tilly all do well, but Crystal is the only one that has much to do and he comes away with all the praise.Overall it is aimed more at kids than adults and it's not near the heights of Toy Story.  However there is still lots to enjoy for all ages.",Null,7,10,11 February 2002
Ant-Man," Solidly fun even if it doesn't consistently deliver
","In many ways this is an odd addition to the Marvel universe. As the films seem to get bigger and bigger with each one, Ant-Man is surprisingly small (as the title suggests). It is not just the character, but also the plotting – it is not really a world-beating foe here, but just a simple robbery (albeit for an unique item). In doing so, the film gets to do what so many of the other films do (have fun at its own silliness), but it benefits by not having to deliver a massive universal conclusion too.In some ways the film plays to this well, and it has some very funny moments along with a general sense of fun; however at the same time it always feels like it is not quite firing on all cylinders either. Of course Edgar Wright famously left the film in the middle, and one does have to wonder how much more spark he would have brought to the final film if he had been allowed to. There is still a lot to enjoy about its silliness (the final fight on the train, and Thomas the Tank Engine himself being a great example), but too much of it seems ordinary, albeit with the extraordinary narrative device. It is expensively produced, and has some clever sequences, but the most fun moments do tend to highlight that not enough of the film is up there.The cast work hard and mostly do well. Rudd is fun, although when in shrunken action mode, his key appeal is less evident as he is an effect not a character. Peña is not the second name on the cast list by a mile, however he is one of the best bits of casting, and his comedic delivery produces some of the most fun moments (the story- telling montages). Douglas, Lilly, Stoll, Cannavale, Harris, Donovan, and others are all solid, but nobody really goes out of their way to make it their best work or even close. In the end Ant- Man is a fun blockbuster, even if it is not as consistent, nor as fun, as it should have been.",Null,1,5,26 December 2015
21 Jump Street," Occasionally amusing but is always trying too hard
","Being in the UK, I was only aware of the show 21 Jump Street retrospectively because of Johnny Depp becoming famous; other than that I had never seen it but figured that this would be fine to watch the film remake. The plot is as the show, two young police officers are selected to go undercover in the school system as students in order to crack open the drugs trade by befriending the dealers and then uncovering the supplier above them. As one would expect, hilarity ensues. Well, sort of.Billed as a comedy 21 Jump Street could never be accused of being high-brow or setting its sights too high. The tone of the film is not as low as gross-out comedy, but generally the tone is juvenile and consistently crude. This shows itself in the constant swearing, the noise that it brings with itself and the sense of it being a lot less funny than it thinks it is. It is a shame because it had potential; it has a nice tone of self-mockery but it is never done smartly enough to really take (it is spelt out in mile-high letters, ruining the impact it could have had). Along with some of this, there are specific jokes and moments that I laughed at (bits of Ice Cube's excessive delivery, the lack of explosions during a car chase etc) but mostly the humour is broad and wide and simple in the extreme. Part of the problem for me was that it wasn't sharp enough – it felt baggy and relaxed in a way that sort of suits the characters and the tone of the film, but doesn't suit the material. As a result the jokes feel softer than they should be and they are always worked harder than they can stand.By this I mean the time spent on each. Some are hit and move on and they work well for it, but too often we have the joke settling in and having too much time on it, so that the film and the actors feel like they are trying too hard with lesser material, which I guess is partially true at least. Hill and Tatum benefit from playing against type (to a point) but neither is great here – just noisy and boisterous. Larson has nothing to really do while Franco's main impact is to continually bug you about where you've seen him before (until you realise you're thinking of his brother). Riggle is a funny guy – I know this because I'm a Daily Show fan, but here he is just noisy (a little funny – but not too much). Ice Cube is OK but his one-joke performance really only made me laugh once or twice.21 Jump Street isn't an awful film by any means – it is just a very broad and unpolished one. The jokes lacks sharpness and the film feels like it is overdoing most things and trying too hard for too little return. There are moments and jokes that made me laugh but they were too few and far between, leaving distracting and slightly amusing noise to fill the rest of the film. So-so at best and it really needs you to be in a lazy, Friday-night mindset before you even bother approaching it.",Null,0,1,25 August 2012
Bridget Jones's Diary," Funny  but it's really just a feature length version of Ally McBeal in the UK isn't it?
","After yet another year of loneliness and disappointments in love Bridget decides to improve her lot and find love while keeping track of her progress in her diary.  She gets involved with her cad of a boss, Daniel, but also is attracted to the upright Mark Darcy.  Will she get either or loose both?Brought to cinemas on a wave of hype due to the success of the book this was well looked for.  I've never read the book  nor do I read those type of books so I had an open mind but feared I may not like it.  The plot is relatively straightforward but is quite amusing.  The jokes are funny and some of the situations are very good.  It also boasts the most realistic fight put on film (no fancy moves or punches  just two men swinging, kicking and scrabbling around).  What put me off was the similarities to the US TV show Ally McBeal.Like Ally McBeal the film uses fantasy scenes that only exist in our character's head and she has a troublesome love life.  This is OK but it does give you the feeling you've seen it al before somewhere.  The bigger problem is that the character suffers from the same problems as Ally  in that you want her to just get a grip and grow up.  For women this is different as they may see elements in the character that they can recognise in themselves (like many men could in High Fidelity's Rob Gordon), however for me Ally is irritating as she seeks perfection and is never happy. Bridget has the same basic character and it makes her hard to get behind  the only sentiment I can say I felt for the lead was pity rather than empathy.That said Zellweger still does a good job  her accent is good and she does manage to look a little frumpy and put upon.  Ignoring the question of why they couldn't get a British actress to do it (one word  money) then she does well.  Grant is funny in a harder role than usual  he still does hi usual stammering bit but at least he's a bit more of a cad than a fop. Firth is a bit Stoney but is good and the support cast (including Jim Broadbent) are all good.Overall this is funny but it is definitely for girls as many men will fail to sympathise with the character of Bridget.  I saw some of her in many of my women friends of the same age but I still couldn't get past the idea that she was a bit irritating.  However if you like the book and you can watch Ally McBeal without wanting to slap her then you'll like this.  Even if you don't it still has some funny moments.",Null,1,2,9 June 2002
Captain America: The First Avenger," Nothing special but at least it is an entertaining romp without too much Avengers baggage
","I'm starting to go off the endless churn of superhero movies that keep coming out – they tend not to differ from the others and I dislike the way that all of the Marvel ones currently have the unnecessary weight of linking to next year's Avengers movie, tending to make them cluttered. Having heard Thor called one of the better ones, and then not really caring for it, I didn't hold out much hope for Captain America being much cop. I was curious to see it though because I figured they couldn't make it as bad as the cheap and nasty one from 1990.The film does what they all do which is to step back to the origins story and go from there; this is often a good device and it works well here to, allowing the viewer to get in with the characters while also providing a solid storyline for the majority. Although I know that the Red Skull is a key villain within the Captain America story, I'm not sure if I would have rather seen him kept back for a separate film and maybe only alluded to here. He does provide a solid thread for the second half of the film but it did feel a little rushed and I thought the conflict between the two of them lacked a real edge or personal investment – he was just the 'baddie' and thus has to fight the 'goodie', more could have been done with the aspect of them being 'related' in terms of the creative process to add some teeth to them – but it wasn't.It does still work though, mainly because, unlike Thor, the film remembers that while it may want to pave the way for another blockbuster, its primary function is to entertain. I found it quite fun, it never seemed overly heavy and while it did try and stay away from the pantomime nature of its hero, it didn't try and force a lot of darkness onto it. It is daft and it doesn't have much in the way of substance but the effects are pretty good and I never really tired of it in the way I did with Thor. The film also benefits from the time it is set in as well as I liked the period touches and generally the advanced weapons were given a nicely dated feel to them (although some of the bigger laser cannons did look a bit silly in my opinion).The cast do a solid job with what little there is to work with. Evans is a solid lead and is likable enough – he keeps the heart of his character which is important and even when 'super' he never comes over like he is indestructible. Atwell works well with him and is easy on the eye while Jones shows that even when he phones it in, he is still a strong screen presence. Weaving as always is a good presence and here is no exception even though every time he spoke I thought of Wenger Herzog; he is a good presence though and again this was part of the reason I was sad to see his character only be part of the film and not made more of. Support is solid from Cooper, Tucci, Luke and many other familiar faces.Overall Captain America is not a good enough film to make me overcome my general apathy towards the endless parade of these Marvel superhero movies (we have years of these characters planned to come) but it was at least one of the ones that I enjoyed. The 'Avengers' clutter is mostly kept to the side and the solid origins story makes for a cheerful and entertaining romp. Not brilliant by any means but I did enjoy it for what it was – which doesn't sound like much but too often even that is a bar that some of these films aren't able to reach.",Null,1,6,6 November 2011
American Hustle," Runs a little long but is stylish, well acted and generally engaging, but you need to leave the awards hyping at the door
","It is that time of year again, the time of year where films are talked up for their awards potential, where good films are hyped as the greatest films ever and so on – so it is a time to be wary of publicity. This is the case to a certain extent with American Hustle because it is a film whose marketing doesn't quite make it clear what it is, but does make it clear that it is probably the most brilliant thing you'll ever see. Of course it doesn't live up to this hype and I can understand why many viewers going in with these words in their brains came out disappointed, which is why it is important to try to leave this in the lobby and see the film for what it is.This also helps because from the trailers it isn't clear what the film is; whether it is a slick caper movie, a comedy or a true-story drama or thriller. Part of the reason I think they struggled to really pigeonhole it when selling it was that it does rather sit across all of these genres and surprisingly it does so pretty effectively. The story is based on truth and this is something that the film makes pretty clear from the very start with the 'some of this happened' legend. The film is also effective as a comedy since the characters and rather out of control situations are often amusing and sometimes very funny. However more than this, the film is a drama because although you laugh, you are not laughing at the characters because they never lose the tragic cores that so many of them have. Although the film does not quite have the heart that could have added more, this aspect does draw you into the characters and it supports the drama as it unfolds. The story does build well even if it is a solid pace rather than a thriller; ironically the weaker moments of the narrative come towards the end and it maybe doesn't have the climax one would have hoped for.The strength of the film is the delivery. Much is said of the cast and they are all good because they do not let the period costumes, hair and narrative excesses turn them into caricatures. Instead all of them really seem to 'get' the comic-tragic mix and deliver on this very well. Bale does it the best and is really good in a subdued role, giving his best turns opposite Renner, who himself is very good in a smaller role. I've no great love for Cooper but he is also good here. The two female roles are both very strong too, with Adams impressing and my opinion of Lawrence only increasing. Russell's direction and indeed the whole style of the film is very much owing a debt to others – in particular Scorsese and Goodfellas. Although these influences are very clear, I didn't really ever feel it was a copy because the film made it work for itself. The costumes, hair, sets and all aspects of the production come together really well to create a very effective sense of time and place.The hype has not helped this film – well, maybe it helps for votes in awards but not for the viewer. It isn't as flawless as some would suggest, but it is still a well done film that walks a fine line and delivers a mostly engaging story. The mix of comedy with the tragic characters is very well done across the board, adding some grit into the film and preventing it from being just slick superficiality or comedic caricatures with big hair. Leave the Oscar hype at the door and you'll find this an enjoyable film for many reasons.",Null,6,10,9 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," A rich epic based on great performances - a little too lush but still a great tale of the corrupting nature of power
","Michael Corleone continues his rise within organised crime in 1950's America, by expanding his family's empire across hotels and casinos.  When an attempt on his life fails Michael proceeds with his dealings in Cuba with Hyman Roth, a deal that will not be as straightforward as it appears. Meanwhile we are told the story of a young Vito's move to American and his rise from the ghetto up into the world of organised crime.I don't know what I can actually add to the sheer weight of praise that has been heaped onto this film - it is as accomplished a film as everyone says and is rightly one of the few examples of a sequel improving and building on a film.  The plot follows two separate strands, the continuing rise of Michael that is as much detrimental to his family as it is beneficial to his pocket; the other thread being Vito's arrival in America as a child and his rise up within the Italian ghettos.  The two stories are not as intertwined as I had remembered - they are very separate and the film can go for quite a while before it switches over.  In a way this works better as it allows both stories to go ahead without fragmenting either too much.This film, as with many gangster films, has been accused of glamorising the life of crime and those involved in it, however, if anything Godfather II does this even less than the original did.  The film shows the moral collapse of Michael in the same way as the first showed his power.  In fairness it does contrast the rise of the two dons - showing how Vito manages to keep his family together.  Despite this I would still argue that Michael's path is far from glamorous.The two narratives are both excellent but for different reasons.  Vito's rise is very interesting and provides solid back story to the first film and we can clearly see the change in Vito from a quiet young man to the influential powerbroker that he became - we also sadly see the rise in his demons and his viciousness.  Meanwhile Michael's tread sees more powerful deals and double crosses as he continues to gain more power.  This was overly complicated for me the first time I saw it but, with reviewing it I have gotten more from it each time - more understanding and more enjoyment. The twin stories are both engaging and the three hour plus running time passes effortlessly - this is a saga and it never feels like the running time was anything more than what was necessary.The cast are fantastic.  Naturally the kudos go to the two leads, and they deserve it.  Pacino has a less showy role than in the first film as he has already done his falling - here we only see further proof of the corrupting nature of his power.  De Niro steals the film this time with a measured performance that parallels Michael's change in the first film - it is a performance that lacks a certain amount of personality but shows us the traits that the film is interested in.  As before the support cast are great, Duvall is reliable as ever, while the most improved role goes to Cazale, who's Fredo becomes more important to the story and almost becomes a biblical character.  Quality comes in waves with Shire, Strasberg, Spradlin, Kirby and many others with solid performances.  Keaton is good but she is not given as much time as I would have liked, even if her scenes are important and powerful.Overall this is a great film that is based on a classy pair of stories that bring the subtexts with them and a collection of characters that are well developed by a script and some great actors.  It may be a little too lavish and plush for my own personal tastes, but it is a rich story.  To a certain degree the production values and sheer class of this film could be accused of glamorisation, but generally those who say this have managed to totally miss the fact that this is a cautionary tale that shows the corruption of power.",Null,11,19,13 April 2004
The Bourne Ultimatum," Urgent pace and action makes it rise above the so-so plotting to be an efficient and exciting action movie (SPOILERS)
","Simon Ross, a reporter with UK newspaper The Guardian writes a couple of articles on the mystery of Treadstone and Jason Bourne  he has not definite answers but the detail suggests that he has a source deep within the programme. CIA Deputy Director Vosen wants to silence this source as it could compromise his black ops units around the world. Meanwhile Jason Bourne, last seen in Russia, also wants to discover Simon Ross's source. The race is on  Bourne trying to learn more of his past, the CIA trying to close the door forever.At the time of writing IMDb users have placed this film as #54 in the list of best all-time films and the sheer volume of praise for it is overwhelming. Now, on one hand, this film doesn't really deserve all this but I can understand why it has been the recipient of all of it because it has been a roundly terrible summer for blockbusters, trilogies especially. Thus when one that is enjoyable and effective came along it was no surprise that it stood out from the crowd. For this is what Bourne Ultimatum is. It is not brilliant nor 'one of the greatest films ever made' but it is effective and thrilling to the point where I was happy to ignore the weaknesses.And I disagree with others who suggest there are no weaknesses here because I maintain that the film (and the trilogy) is built on a very obvious narrative that offers few surprises but does offer plenty of opportunity for action. It is this action where the film excels and it is credit to Greengrass and his cinematographer for producing a film that feels urgent from the very start and most of the way through. I appreciate that some will dislike the constantly moving camera just as they did in Supremacy but for me it is the making of the film as it draws the audience so close into the action that the specific motivations for it become secondary. This means we can have an intense action scene in Turin where the majority of it does not relate to the bigger picture in regards the narrative. However I did find that the narrative could have done with a focus here and there as it doesn't explore the characters as much as I was hoping and the 'conclusion' of the film is weak. The globe-trotting aspect of the film is a bonus as well and you can see why many compare Bourne to Bond. However this isn't just a cosmetic title on the screen  the film really uses the locations to good effect and is all the better for it.The action is beautifully done though. The intensity and excitement of the action drives us forward; it does not need a pumping soundtrack or loads of obvious CGI, the camera does some of the work and the viewers do the rest. Witness the car chase in New York  nothing we have not seen before in terms of location but delivered with a documentary style that makes it feel all the more exciting. Another high is the fist fight between Bourne and Desh  almost silent and hard to follow but it is the proximity of the action that does the job.Within this style the cast mostly pitch their performances to be clipped and urgent. Damon does sterling work as the invincible action man even if the material leaves him a little exposed. There is only so many times that I can see him climbing out of impossible wrecks without losing touch with him as a character. It is disappointing that we did not get to see Damon have to work his acting muscles more though  the 'revelation' that Bourne volunteered for all he had done is badly handled and just brushed over  nowhere near the impact that it should have had that our 'hero' is a baddie himself, and not because of the programme. Stiles is so-so but fills the role. Strathairn, Glenn and Allen are all good in their various CIA roles  nothing surprising but they do it effectively. Considine and Finney are both good presences. It isn't really an actors' film but everyone does the basics well enough.Overall then this is a very effective and enjoyable action movie that benefits from an urgency and intimacy that comes from Greengrass' direction and total delivery. Far from the model of perfection that some have claimed but easily one of the best films of the summer (although for 2007 that is not necessarily a great recommendation).",Null,10,14,4 September 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," Funny, lively and enjoyable despite being a little predictable
","On his first day at a new school, Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford. However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister, Kat, is negative, bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable. Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be paid to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca - but things never go smoothly when it comes to love.I'm not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame, trading on the same old plots and clichés that have been around since Animal House and Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving rise to some poor films like `She's all that'.  The plot for this is basically `The Taming of the Shrew' updated - most of it bares little resemblance to the play but that doesn't matter - the core is interesting enough to stand on it's own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and it's fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that's not it.No - the film is funny, lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are genuinely funny, such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress. The jokes happily never stoop to the gross-out type and this helps it feel fresh and lively, rather than just scrapping the bottom of the barrel.Another strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in `She's all that' this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and he does well here - he doesn't over-egg his bad boy cake and his fall into love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles she has had of late.  Here she rises above the `outsider' cliché given to her and does good work - again being a likeable and believable character.. Gordon-Levitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two roles, likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three adult support roles really do well and are very funny -  Janney, Mitchell and especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a side role that doesn't play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in bigger roles but here she is a `minority face' in a predominately white film, just as she was in She's All That - maybe I'm being a little paranoid but that's what it feels like.Overall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was. It didn't sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may be predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen comedies you COULD watch, this is fantastic!",Null,109,124,13 October 2002
Fargo," A solid story is supported by a weird and wonderful array of characters and some sharp writing
","Jerry Lundegaard is a car dealer who has money problems.  Unable to ask his wealthy father-in-law for money, Jerry employs two criminal types to kidnap his wife and then split the ransom with Jerry.  However when a cop pulls over the two criminals, a triple shooting is the result and the police get involved.  With Jerry getting pressure from the kidnappers now that thing has gone sour and Officer Marge Gunderson making progress in her investigation, things are far from as straightforward as was originally planned.Getting past the whole `true story' nonsense, this is easily one of the Coen's most polished films as well as one of their most enjoyable.  The film opens with a bleak, snowy scene with a great sweeping score and pretty much sets the tone for a film that feels bigger than it actually is.  The opening scene between Jerry and his two contracted hoods is really good and is typical of the comic tone that runs all the way through the film.  The plot is cleverly written and so much more than another `job gone wrong' thing, however what drives the film is the weird web of unusual characters that we encounter along the way.  Setting the film in a part of American with Scandinavian roots was clever as it gives the characters funny accents before you even worry about what they are going to say with them!  The screenplay won an Oscar and it deserved it simply for the dialogue and the characters it creates.  It is a dark film but it is one that fans of the Coen brothers' universe will find funny.Of course it helps no end to have a great cast to deliver it.  McDormand won the Oscar despite only being one of several good performances in the film. Her Marge is funny yet relentless in her pursuit.  Macy is as reliable as ever and it is his increasingly frantic performance that is the best of the film for my money - weedy, pathetic and hopelessly out of his depth but funny with it.  Buscemi and Stormare are both very good for very different reasons and the rest of the support cast is comprised of many strange characters who are funny.  Only the very occasional bit hits a sour note, but this is very occasional and doesn't hurt the film one little bit.Overall this may not be a true story but that is not to say that it isn't fascinating anyway - who says truth is better than fiction?!  The roundly great performances do great work with a deserved Oscar winner of a screen play that fills a solid crime storyline with all manner of characters that produce a gripping and funny film that is one of the best and most accessible of the Coen brother films.",Null,5,8,18 April 2004
Rush," A well told sports story that was engaging and makes great use of sound to draw in the viewer
","On the day I watched Rush I had just been listening to a film review show from Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo from early January 2014 in which they had discussed an acceptable moratorium for spoilers. Kermode's reasoning for always being careful is that even if something happened in real life, it is unfair to assume everyone knows this, so it is worth avoiding details of the ends of movies. At the time it was a discussion I just listened to but it came back to me when watching Rush because many months prior in their review, the pair did not talk about the outcome of the story or the fates of the characters involved. This was important to me because I did not know of these guys apart from their names – I was born in the 1970s and really only watched F1 for a few years when Hill and Schumacher were going at it, so for me this was a real thriller and not just a dramatic retelling of stories I knew already.And I watched it as such although I acknowledge that for those in the know, perhaps the film will have a different impact. For me though I really enjoyed it because one of the main things it does is to show how totally life and death the sport was back then, how unforgiving the conditions were and how everything was being driven right on the edge of what was possible. As it is an American film there is perhaps more explanation than was necessary, plus the races themselves are really cut down to be a handful of sequences of overtaking and dramatics; again this may annoy some, but as someone who drifted away from the sport after watching one too many processions around a track, this was fine by me. That said, the racing action is shot with urgency and quick edits around the cars and the driver POV to put the viewer in the middle of the action, although this is not the main weapon, because that is the sound editing.By another coincidence I had recently watched a show with Idris Elba about his passion for cars and speed and one of my complaints had been that the sound of these powerful engines had been impacted upon by unnecessary music, losing a bit of the sense of the power and speed. With Rush the opposite is wonderfully true – the music can be easy to miss because the main soundtrack is that of the engines. I can only imagine the impact of seeing it in the cinema but even for me the sound effects were great. Outside of the races the creation of the characters is solid – not deep or detailed but more than enough to make the point and engage the viewer. Hunt and Lauda are shown in broad but effective strokes and their rivalry and begrudging respect is clear – this is important because although it is a race, the film needs us to be on side with both of them, recognizing the flaws of each but also respecting them.The performances from Hemsworth and Brühl both work well at this level. I don't know the people from real life but from the clips and summary at the end it seemed like they got it pretty well as it needed to be. The supporting cast continues the 'broad strokes' approach and are good enough to engage the viewer. Howards' direction is brisk and, although F1 purists may not appreciate the rapid edits and shots, I thought the approach helped build tension. I do think that knowing all the details of the true story will limit the impact of the film at a dramatic level, but I think it is strong enough to hold the interest anyway thanks to how well it tells the story full stop. It may not have a lot of depth and detail, but in the focus on the rivalry and these two men it is engaging with a good hatful of moments which were thrilling and moving.",Null,1,2,21 January 2014
Predator," A B-movie creature feature given the A treatment by a great action director
","A team of commandos are sent into a central American jungle to extradite US airmen that are being held by terrorists.  During the rescue attempt the airmen and the terrorists are killed and the commandos being to return to their pickup location.  However as they travel back across the jungle they are picked off one by one by an unseen assassin.  With his teams' numbers dwindling, Dutch decides to take a stand.This ranks as one of Schwarzenegger's best films, mainly because he doesn't ham up the one-liners etc and just plays it straight.  The story is pretty straight forward.  Once the issue of the airmen rescue is forgotten it is a straight hunt or be hunted affair.  The film manages to create a great sense of tension by not revealing the predator until near the end, this means we, like the commandos, are not quite sure what's doing the hunting.  If the tension was so good then this could have been a slasher style film with each character being bumped off in a series of gory ways.  However McTiernan makes sure that it never feels that basic.The action is good throughout.  But the film benefits from a strong male cast - not great actors but they all fit the parts well.  Schwarzenegger isn't wearing his star power on his sleeve like he does in other films and is good here.  The rest of the cast are filled out by what could be kindly described as B list stars (except maybe Bill Duke), but Carl Weathers and ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura do well.Overall this is a B movie creature feature, but it's carried out with such style and aplomb that it's hugely enjoyable throughout.",Null,107,148,8 February 2002
The Aviator," Beautifully told and with a great story  pardon the pun, but three hours flew by
","Having inherited his fortune from a tooling business, Howard Hughes seems intent in ploughing into his first film, constantly reshooting and reediting it, leaving the money worries to his business manager Noah Dietrich. His passion for flying leads him to invest heavily in his own domestic airline, TWA, while also making motion pictures and having relationships with some of the most beautiful women (and girls) in Hollywood at the time. Despite suffering from an obsessive compulsion regarding cleanliness, Howard seems to be on top of the world, but attempts to steal a section of the trans-Atlantic business away from Pan-Am proves to be a risky venture, following several failed wartime projects, leading to a high stakes battle.I must be honest and say that, although I watch a lot of movies I don't really care about the real life gossip behind the scenes and hence some elements of this film were news to me; details mainly, but even then I must admit that I knew very little about Howard Hughes outside of the fact that I had seen his name of many films down the years. Certainly I knew comparatively little about his airlines and his personal traits. For this reason I watched the film with some interest but also a pinch of salt as I was aware that these film rarely tell the whole truth. Ignoring this latter concern, I found myself swept along by a great story and a great film and, when it ended some three hours after I sat down, I looked at my watch wondering where the time had gone! The fact that Hughes himself is a very interesting character only helps a script that crams the film full of so much of interest that it is hard not to be caught up in it. At times it labours some points and at other times it will not focus on areas you would like it to, but it still works. I felt the obsessive compulsive thing was lingered on too much once or twice and some scenes featuring it could have been cut down a little bit, but they didn't slow the film much if at all, so it is more opinion that flaw picking. Also, as a fan of the cinema, I expected more of his films to be mentioned but I guess in fairness these are less interesting that his real work. On top of the story, the script is actually exciting and funny as well as being human and involving  a great combination and one reason the hours just went so fast.I have not seen Gangs of NY yet, so cannot say if this is Scorsese returning to form, but it is certainly a very strong piece of direction that screams class and is very much his work. Complicated shots, one take tracking shots across crowded rooms and so on, all make the film look great without seeming overly flashy. I'm not sure if he has used special effects (as in computer graphics) before, but Scorsese seemed very at home with the cgi shots of planes etc used  some may not have been 100% convincing but it's as close as dammit. Unusually for him, the one place he did fall down was with the use of music as I found the choices to be pretty obvious and a bit repetitive; happily it took little away from the film but it is surprising for a man who wallpapers his films with music well when he wants to. The sense of time and place is spot on, mainly due to great costumes, sets and a real attention to detail running through the whole film.The cast add to the feeling that this is a quality production, although at times they are a distraction. First off, DiCaprio is great  and I never thought I'd be allowed to say that again. The guy who showed so much talent early on before appearing to give it up to soulless projects is convincing here in many ways; whether suffering with a drive he can't overcome, being on top of his game or just being funny, DiCaprio does it well. Of course he struggles with the fact that he never ages (making it hard to see the passage of time in the film) and that he looks 16 anyway, but he tries his hardest to make us forget this and, for the most part, he does it. Aside from him, the rest of the cast are best seen as support or cameos and generally they are very good. With real, famous characters it is always a risk that actors will give impressions rather than performances but the likes of Blanchett and Beckinsdale are better than that and do both equally well. Reilly is good as always, Baldwin is enjoyable and it is always a pleasure to see Alan Alda, who happens to be great here. The only problem with the cast having so many stars in it is that they are occasionally distracting  for example Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Brent Spiner all have little to do other than providing a 'hey look it's ' factor.Overall though it is a very impressive film and one that is enjoyable to watch even if you start the film with very little knowledge of Howard Hughes (something that modern multiplex audiences will do). The script is interesting, exciting and funny by turns and the direction is stylish without being overly flashy. The cast are all good despite a few of them being more distracting than value-adding.",Null,3,7,13 January 2005
Léon: The Professional," Beautiful love story
","Generally a love story about a 40 year old man who lives by himself and a 12 year old girl would go down about as well as a porkpie at a Jewish wedding with cries of paedophilia from far and wide.  However Leon is just that - a love story, everything else is incidental or situation, and has become a modern classic.What makes this work is that Leon is the 40 year old but appears more naive and childlike, while Mathilda is the grown up in a 12 year old's body - a modern version of Lolita.  The love between them is a pure love, like the relationship between two children, where Leon protects Mathilda and cares for her and Mathilda provides a life that fills the cold existence of Leon's hitman-focused lifestyle.Portman is excellent in this role - she has yet to do anything better, Reno is well cast and handles the opening up of his character in a very believable fashion - he is totally convincing as a killer and a nervous child making friends for the first time.  Oldman overacts like a madman!  If you look closely at his shirt sleeves you'll see his cuff links are actually pineapple rings because he's such a big ham!  His performance doesn't sit well beside the others and he seems to be in a different movie at times. However he does bring a cold killer element with it that works well and offsets his eccentricities.A classic love story, look beyond the guns at the two central performances and you'll see one of the most beautiful relationships in modern films.  The ending will fill you with happiness and break your heart in equal measure.",Null,7,17,17 October 2001
Oblivion," Technologically impressive but lacking in punch and emotion
","I suppose credit is due to a big blockbuster sci-fi that it tries to have interesting ideas and not just effects – the best sci-fi's generally being those with the most interesting and engaging concepts rather than the biggest CGI budget. Oblivion has this in some regards because the setup is engaging (if familiar) and some later developments in the plot add complexity to the mix – but again perhaps not that much. There is potential here but it doesn't really come out or make an impact as it should.The film boasts twists and turns but in the end you've probably seen them all before and they will not surprise too many people with where it goes. What surprised me was how little I actually cared – I was carried along by the familiar noise but I was never really emotionally into it and I felt I really should have been given the plotting. Instead what I was left with was a decent story that is very expensively and impressively delivered. The film looks great throughout, whether it is the base station floating in space or the shots back on earth of a desolate wasteland. The blend between the effect and the real is pretty much seamless and it makes the film more engaging as a result as it is easy to suspend disbelief and join. It is a shame then that so little really gets meat on the bone, whether it is plot or characters.The performances sort of match this because everyone looks great but in terms of what they have to do it isn't so much there for them. I'm no great fan of Cruise but he does have that certain something that holds the attention. He is almost too clean cut and 'movie star' though, because he is never not Tom Cruise here and he cannot bring out much emotion in himself or from the viewer. Riseborough and Kurylenko both do solid work but generally what I remembered of them was how stunning they were – not how moved I was by their characters. Freeman and Coaster- Waldau and also good in terms of presence but less effective in terms of what they deliver, while Leo has little to do.Oblivion is technologically impressive no doubt , it looks good form start to finish no matter where it is. It doesn't have as much of a heart or brain as it thinks it does though and ultimately the story feels very familiar, which is even more of a problem when some of those films you'll think of are more moving and satisfying than this one.",Null,1,1,21 October 2013
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Average film that will only get better if you really like Williams' hyper comedy and overacting
","In the Vietnam demilitarised zone, the US troops are 'entertained' by the forces radio under the command of Sgt Maj Dickerson and 2nd Lt Hauk. Into the rather stale and censored station comes broadcaster Adrian Cronauer, who's impressions and crazy sense of humour immediately gets the support of the troops and becomes an instant hit. However his inability to follow orders causes major problems with his superiors; but things get worse as the Vietnam war starts to kick off with bombings and guerrilla warfare. Cronauer is forced to enter the reality of life in Vietnam and come out from behind his microphone.It has been many years since I saw this film and I remember laughing at it so much that I bought the soundtrack because it included snippets of Cronauer's radio broadcast. However then I was a young teenager and was maybe more of a Williams fan than I am now  and here we have the crux of the film, if you love Robin Williams' style of stand up then you will enjoy this film but if you aren't won over by that then there is little else to win you over. The plot mostly trades on Cronauer upsetting his superiors before eventually getting into a final 30 minutes of 'oh, look, isn't war awful' that is delivered with such an obvious change of pace that. The film should have had this aspect running through it with a blacker vein of humour (a la M*A*S*H for example) and it would have been much better; as it is, it is more like an hour of a stand up show which then tries to be an affecting war story. It is OK but it didn't really work for me because I didn't find the jokes that funny and didn't appreciate the sudden reality check at the end.Williams tries really hard and I was surprised that I didn't laugh as much as I did  maybe he never had time to get momentum up as his routines were edited all to hell and were delivered too fast. I have seen him in early stand up and found him hilarious so maybe it was a mix of delivery and material letting him down. The support cast is mostly pretty good and features some well known actors even if they don't all have that much to do.Whitaker has a good feel for the material and is nice enough; Kirby allows himself to be a fool; Wuhl is OK as a sort of comedy aside; Edson is OK and both Walsh and Willingham add clout in more serious roles. Tran and Sukapatana have much lesser roles and exist to carry the weight of the 'war is awful' message, they drift aimlessly enough for most of the film before getting to shout lots towards the end.Overall this is an OK film that rather averagely delivers comedy and a 'war is hell' message, but it was a problem for me that it seemed to deliver these is two different strands rather than being successfully mixed together. If you are a big Robin Williams fan then you should like this as his manic stand up personae gets a good run here but I imagine many viewers will feel that the 'message' is rather thrust onto them. Worth a look but there are much better wartime comedies that are darker, funnier and much more intelligent than this one.",Null,5,18,10 July 2004
American Pie," Funny but very crude and tasteless
","A group of high school friends make a pact to lose their virginity before the night of their prom.  Each has differing degrees of good fortune and goes after girls of different types (and ages) in their quest.  However the perils of that first time are all too evident.The next step in gross out teen comedies was a film entirely focused on dirty jokes and rude set ups.  The plot can be described in one line but really isn't even as complex as all that.  However what it does do is allow many funny scenes to be placed one after another  from the premature scene to the frothy beer to the pie itself.  The problem is that, unless you are in the mood for really bad taste comedy then you'll probably hate this.The jokes and scenes are all crude and it's hard not to get taste fatigue during the film.  There are lucky moments of refreshing available  the best of which is Levy as Jim's Dad  providing the innocent lines that are like a breeze in a smelly room!  The teenage cast are al alright but only Suvari and Scott standout as reasonable hopes for the future.Overall  very funny if your taste is somewhere between poor to non-existent. If you want wit, humour or subtlety then you'll be well served to go else where.",Null,17,32,16 July 2002
Burn After Reading," The Cohen's miss all their usual marks to produce an 'OK' film but no more than that
","Although I've seen True Grit recently, I am a few films behind with the Cohen's and watching Burn after Reading was part of me catching up. The film has a deliberately complex plot as innocent blackmail by two gym employees sees them accidentally mixed up with two couples each going through divorce and the CIA. Everyone's motives and intentions are misconstrued and soon confusion leads to messy and bloody misunderstandings. Although I had heard mixed reviews about the film, it did seem like rather an open goal for them since this was the sort of thing they had done before to great effect in Blood Simple and Fargo: small people in over their heads as a simple crime spins out of control.For some reason though, they get it wrong here and mostly their usual darkly comic is missing. The oddball characters are all here but the plot is far too messy and has far too many characters in the mix. This doesn't matter too much as the film passed the halfway point because by then it had a bit of momentum and all was clear, but as it laid out the plot everything seemed to be going nowhere and each character seemed to add little. Once the plot is clear the other problems start coming out. The first is that it is not as well written as previous films. The characters all have potential to be comic oddballs but they don't really come off and nobody here is a classic Cohen creation. The comedy doesn't really work as it should either and it didn't have that darkly comic feel that Fargo and other films did. It wasn't that I expected to laugh, but I just didn't have the otherworldly feel that they often give me.I know that part of the point of the film was that the plot was a complex mess but for me it was also a problem because this messy aspect tended to detract more than it added. The additions were the couple of great scenes with the two intelligence heads trying to get a handle on what was happening – these were funny and both characters were what I would expect. In the rest the mess is not funny or smart or engaging enough to stand up and, while amusing and able to hold my attention, still feels like it is the Cohen's underperforming. The many star names actually don't help as much as one would have liked. Clooney is amusing and works well enough but, while I liked Pitt's attempts at his character, I never once thought he was able to shake off the idea that he was Brad Pitt 'doing' quirky. McDormand is good though, this is the sort of stuff that she does and she does it well. Malkovich, Swinton and Jenkins all add to the feeling that there are too many people in the film who are their faces first and their characters second. Simmons and Rasche are great though – if the film had more scenes like theirs it would have been better for it.Overall Burn after Reading is a sub-par performance from the Cohen's. It has aspirations to be the darkly comic crime film that they have done before and, on paper, all the absurdity and characters are there, but they just don't work as they should on the screen. The mess is part of it, but it also detracts, while the characters are not that good nor the film smart enough, engaging enough or funny enough. The Cohen's on an off-day is still worth seeing, but they have done better and will do again.",Null,0,4,13 June 2011
Watchmen," Not a great film in and of itself but a very good physical reproduction of the book
","With something like this it is always worth knowing what the viewer knows of Watchmen in order to contextualise the opinions one gets. For example I would like to know if you own every possible edition of Watchmen and read it once a week and twice in the week you go to the annual Watchmen convention. Conversely did you not know it was based on anything and just went into this screening because you missed the start of Bride Wars by ten minutes and worried you would not be able to follow it. These things matter they don't mean anyone is right and wrong, but it has meaning. For example, for me, I like the comic book. Not enough to get snotty about people not calling it a graphic novel, but I enjoyed it, thought the plot and characters were interesting and thought that it did work well as a comic with the additional text sections providing a lot to the panels.I found that I quite liked the film then, because it sticks close to the book, and the book is of value and quality. Some things are dropped, some things done differently and some things changed but it doesn't impact much on the film, although I'm sure the message boards will be rammed with people who disagree. The problem with this is that the film itself is not great as a film which is how the majority of people will be coming to it. It sticks so closely to the source material that the characters retain a certain lack of depth that comes with it. Sure, they do everything required within the original material but they also feel a bit limited by it as well and end up a little stiff as a result. In line with this, the film also has a very serious edge that comes over as being a bit ponderous rather than anything else. This is a shame but it does generally come as a result of how fearful the film seems to be of moving too far from the source. Film is a different media from the graphic novel and it should be different in terms of how it does the same things (at least a little).Limited to the panels in the strip, Synder doesn't really manage to explore the themes and make the most of some aspects of the story and characters. The moral and physiological make-ups of our 'heroes' are not really explored or developed so much as they are laid out in a few moments. This is similar to the book of course but what works there doesn't work as well here because this moving, flowing version required a bit more development that we got. Likewise, other than making sure the film looks like an alternative 1980's and that the politicians look like Nixon, Kissinger etc, it doesn't do anything with the setting in terms of satire or commentary. Again this will not bother those looking for a straight reproduction of the film (although if you're that petty then the other changes will) but it does feel like it is all missing and I'm guessing that the casual viewer will wonder what the fuss is all about because there seems to be lots of characters and lots of plot but that it is all lacking depth and frankly takes itself all a bit seriously considering how stiff it is.Synder's direction is good visually though and for me I enjoyed being told a story I was already familiar with but on a big screen with the characters brought to life. OK he doesn't develop much of it but it still looks good and packs a punch. Occasionally he makes bad visual decisions (the sex scene in particular is awful) but mostly he is faithful and reproduces the material well. The use of music, it must be said, is awful. Not the songs themselves (they are good) but how they are used  when they work it is only because what they are over is working despite of the music (the opening credits are great even if the Dylan song is clunkingly obvious) but mostly they are just dropped onto the film without any impact other than being a recognisable song  many do not fit in terms of tone or period and it is jarring throughout.Generally it must be said that the performances are solid rather than impressive. Most of them fit the characters well and it suggests this was the aim of the casting process because in this regard it worked. Haley is a good Rorschach. OK his narration is limited in terms of material and delivery but both still work and he was the Rorschach I have in my head. The moral simplicity of his character does make his job easier though in the same way as Morgan's Comedian and Crudup's Manhattan are 'easier' to deliver straight. Akerman, Goode, Wilson, Gugino and a few others are not as fortunate though because their characters are more complex but they do not have the freedom to move within their material to show this or explore this. As a result they come off looking a lot stiffer even though they are no better or worse than the others. Again the main fault probably lies with Synder because one gets the impression that his direction of their performances was to point at the animated panels and say 'do that'.So as a moving, live-action reproduction of the animated sections of the book it is perfectly fine and I enjoyed it. However as a film it is only OK because it is limited by the lack of development and exploration of themes and characters, seemingly led by the fear of messing with the material to any great extent. Far from the classic many are hailing but yet also not the piece of rubbish that many will say when the backlash begins in earnest.",Null,8,19,9 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Clichéd but a solid, enjoyable thriller (spoiler)
","A man is dragged from the sea by a fishing boat with bullet holes in his back and a device containing details of a Swiss bank account in his hip. Unable to remember who he is or what happened he goes to the bank to find many passports, a lot of money and a gun.  When he leaves the bank he finds that he is being targeted by the police and another, more sinister force. As he puts the pieces together he realises someone is trying to kill him. But who? And why?I went to see this for free at the audience preview in Birmingham and I was genuinely looking forward to it and I pretty much wasn't disappointed.  The plot is nothing special and doesn't go anywhere too surprising but it still makes for an enjoyable ride and is quite thrilling.  The journey is good and it is fun to uncover Jason's past and skills with him.  The ending is OK but it has some elements that are dumb  like he's a killer (but he's a nice killer who can't kill kids!) and the usual happy Hollywood ending.I haven't read the book so I don't know how closely it followed that but I think they did a good job despite falling into several clichés along the way.  The locations are well used and the director doesn't go into travel agent mode the way many directors do when you give them European landmarks to film.  The pacing of the movie was a little too slow at times and there were patches where it dragged  but then the thrills did last for the majority.  The lack of explanation in the plot bothered me a little bit, but I suspect sequels are already in the pipeline.  Also I kept thinking of how much fun the Long Kiss Goodnight was!Damon was pretty good  he was convincing and cool, but maybe a little bland at times.  Potente I don't like.  She got annoying with all her swearing in German etc.  She did OK but I wasn't ever totally sold on her character. Chris Cooper is great despite being office bound for the majority.  Brian Cox was also good but why was he cast? Was it an in-joke that he was also in `The Long Kiss Goodnight'?  I don't know why Stiles was in this for all she got to do  maybe she had a free weekend to do some shots!  My only disappointment was the screen time of Adewale Agbaje.  He is a great actor (doubters should watch his 3 season performance in Oz on HBO), and I hoped he would have a big role.  Alas he doesn't have much screen time and his role is only his usual Nigerian stuff with no scope for showing what he can do.  Someone give this man a film vehicle to show his skills please!Overall this is a solid thriller.  The plot is a bit clichéd but it moves along well and is only occasionally a bit slow.  The ending is the price you pay for a Hollywood blockbuster but other than that it's harmless Saturday night fun and thrills!",Null,2,4,28 August 2002
Hot Rod," Silly little film that is unassuming fun as long as you don't come with high expectations
","Rod Kimble is an amateur stuntman, whose antics don't inspire the local population so much as they do amuse them. Always setting up stunts with his friends, things change when Rod learns that his step-father needs an organ transplant but has no insurance to allow it. Having never yet beaten his step-father in a fight and keen to humiliate him, Rod is determined to save his step-father's life (even if only long enough to defeat him fair and square). In order to do this he decides to jump 13 school buses in front of a paying crowd.When this film recently arrived on Sky I must admit that I had never heard of it and didn't give it much attention. A while later I ended up watching it for the lack of anything better (well, that's not true – it was more a matter of looking for 'lazy' viewing). Having this approach to the film probably helped me enjoy it because my expectations and my demands were low and what I found was a daft little 'sports underdog' film. Those expecting frequent big belly laughs will be disappointed because the film is not that good. However it wisely sets itself firmly in the small-town loser world that makes it have quit a low-key feel that is matched by the manner of delivery as well (so much of it feels 'homemade' rather than the big film production that it is of course). This allowed it to win me over a touch because I warm to it a little bit as one would to an indie comedy as opposed to the big star vehicle blockbuster.This doesn't completely redeem it though and it is never as funny nor as creative as it would like to have though. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty amusing across the whole film but it doesn't hit the high notes very often. The cast help to some degree. Samberg in particular has a sort of gangly charm to him and he is kept grounded by some nice 'going nowhere' characters from McBride and his other friends. Fisher is asked to be attractive, light and simple and this she does very well, making her aspect of the film work quite well. Of course she is helped by a typically good turn from Arnett – although I would have liked more time given to him. McShane is good in it and I really enjoyed the small turn from Parnell (30 Rock's Dr Spaceman).Hot Rod is not a great film by any means but it does have its charm. It is slightly derivative and not as funny as it would like to be but it is still consistently amusing and with a genial air that makes it hard to dislike. Best approached with low demands but it performs well enough if you do.",Null,2,7,12 April 2009
The Italian Job," Enjoyable but not as `fun' as I'd expected it to be
","After a daring gold robbery by stealth and cunning in Venice, a group of criminals celebrate their job.  However one of the group, Steve, turns on them, killing John and leaving the rest for dead.  The rest survive and one year later they find Steve selling the gold in LA.  They recruit John's daughter Stella, an expert safe cracker, in order to steal back his gold and thus get revenge.While I was writing a review of the video game about a year ago I spotted that this remake was in production.  I'll admit that my initial thoughts were `sweet Jesus' and `not everything should be remade', but I was still open to seeing it and, by now, those thoughts had subsided a bit.  The film opens hesitantly and the early scenes with Charlie and John positively stutter.  After the first job the film really picks up and gets enjoyable without every really letting rip.  The downside of this is that it never really becomes a feel good spectacle in the same OTT way that the original was.  Yes, some moments are funny and the final job is quite exciting and quite clever but it isn't `fun' in the way I'd hoped.Some scenes are really weak and I'm sad to say they are most of the ones that rely on Wahlberg.  His scenes (with  Theron and Sutherland) are quite dry and he fails to captivate as a leading man.  Thank God then, for a pretty good support cast.  No, I don't mean Theron, although she is used for her looks quite well, but the male cast.  The rest of the gang bring the laughs and the characters, they are not as emotionally important to the story as Charlie and are much better for it.  Statham does good work and is cool and funny, Green is as good as you'd hope he'd be  although his Napster stuff gets a bit tired after a while.  The highlight for me again was Mos Def  this is the second time in a few months he has been in a small support role but has lifted a film (Brown Sugar being the other).  All three do good jobs round the edges and help support the very iffy Wahlberg.I enjoyed Edward Norton even if he was clearly slumming it a little bit.  I detected a bit of mischief in his eyes when his character is placed second after Charlie by John  ironic as Wahlberg was favoured to play Charlie over Norton who wanted the role!The mini action is good as it doesn't use effects to a great effect  almost a good old fashioned car chase  but to say it compares to some of the other chases this summer is just silly.  Overall this is an enjoyable film but is weak at it's core and suffers as a result.  The film doesn't flow as freely as it should and it is only the enjoyable car chases and sterling work by the Mighty Mos et al, that lifts it to be better than the sum of it's parts. Not great but enjoyable.",Null,0,3,30 September 2003
Baby Driver," Very much a genre film, even if the soundtrack jazzes it up a lot
","A lot of hype around this film, and a lot of big names involved on either side of the camera - Pope and Wright on one side, and many famous faces on the screen itself. I left it a while and approached it without expectation, and I was quite surprised by what I found, considering the praise lavished onto it. Despite being on almost all 'cool' 'best of' lists for 2017, Baby Driver is not much of a movie, although it is a decent genre movie and a great Original Soundtrack.The plot does nothing to surprise or thrill, there are no twists that will knock you sideways, or developments that will feel new or fresh. Indeed it sticks very much to the basics without much added. Where the film works hard is with the production and style. In this way it does look good. It benefits a lot from having plenty of famous names and faces, as well as a comparatively big budget to work with. This budget ensures plenty of style and slickness. This is well combined with the music - which is not only great but frequently very well used; it flows like a musical at times, and I did like this aspect - although by itself it is not really enough to suggest it makes it a great film.Perhaps I was not in the right mood to watch it, but I certainly didn't see the great film that many claim to have - and while I'm sure it will feature on many year-end lists, it was just a solid genre film with plenty of resources.",Null,0,2,26 December 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very worthy but why didn't I find it fun too watch?
","Wizard Gandalf retrieves an evil ring from Bilbo Baggins he finds it's true nature and must destroy.  Frodo, a hobbit with a pure enough heart to resist the ring, is selected to make the journey to destroy the ring.The story here is very heavy and a good job has been made of trimming down the story to make it accessible to those not familiar with the story.  The characters are quite well developed - the beauty of the film is that it knows it will be a trilogy of films so it doesn't have to rush past characterisation where other films would need to get down to action quickly to ensure that it can get a sequel greenlighted.The visuals are fantastic, the special effects are brilliant and are mixed well with New Zealand's natural scenery to great effect, there's no doubting that Jackson can cope with such a grand canvas to work on.  The action scenes are also very well handled and the monster special effects are mostly good (only occasionally it is obvious that some are computer generated).The main problem with the film is that it isn't a lot of fun.  I know it wants to be serious but it also needs to be fun for the audience to watch, three hours is a long time to sit listening to lots of talk about family trees and ancient quests etc.  I didn't want comedy but it all took itself too seriously to be totally enjoyable.  Another problem with it is that the pacing is all off - the film has a set pattern that goes all the way through, first a talky scene with slow camera movements, then the music changes, the camera starts zooming around and we enter an action scene, then back to a talky scene, then an action/chase scene and so on.  It all gets a bit tiresome with it's continual cut between action/talking/action/talking with a relentless monotony.  There's nothing wrong with the content but it all gets a bit tiresome after a while.The cast are roundly great - almost totally well cast with the exception of Hugo Weaving who looks, sounds and acts just like his character in the Matrix - it makes it too distracting.  Wood as Frodo is a little too serious at times, gazing off into the distance and delivering straight dialogue. Bean and Mortensen are both great, Bean especially with his flawed character struggling against the ring.  The best character in the film is the ring! The film suffers from not having a bad guy to focus on (Christopher Lee is built up but he isn't the main source of evil).  Giving the ring itself the ability to tempt and manipulate and speak, this makes it the main evil character and makes the quest even more tense.Overall it's a big grown up blockbuster with amazing effects but it isn't very much fun to watch (not just laughs but basic enjoyment).  A good film but far from perfect - 4 out of 5.",Null,13,25,4 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Visually impressive but bloated and unwieldy
","As the city of Zion fortifies itself for defence against the influx of sentinels, the two remaining ships of the fleet prepare to return to the city.  Neo lies in a coma with the sole survivor of the attack on the fleet, however his brain patterns show that he is lost somewhere within the matrix. Trinty and Morpheus go to rescue him and return him to the real world. Back in the real world, Zion is under attack from the sentinels, Neo decides that he must travel into the machine city and confront the creator of the matrix while Niobe pilots the remaining ship back to Zion to take on the sentinels.I love the original Matrix, but can't help feel that the 2 overblown, over serious sequels have damaged it.  This film works a little better than the second sequel but not by much.  Where Reloaded left us with unanswered questions, Revolutions offers us the answers.  Sadly the 'answers' just left me confused and bewildered.  I didn't feel like the film even tried to explain what was going on, and the ending came about far too suddenly and with little explanation.  I know that a film is good if it leaves you thinking about things and I could sort of guess that Neo might have become some sort of programme etc at the end, but I still felt that the film should have helped me out even a little bit!The plot is very heavy going and it lacks the light imagination evident in the first film.  This really sucks the fun out of the film and makes it hard work - I have nothing against it being thought provoking and requiring thought, but it all seemed very laboured to me.  The opening hour is quite hard work and the whole 'train station' thing is never really explained and just seems designed to fill time or something.  The action all looks great - the attack on Zion is visually very impressive and is quite exciting. However some fight scenes are so overblown that they failed to inspire.  The shootout in the check room of the club is simply a tired retread of the groundbreaking lobby shootout but it is the final fight with Smith that shows what I mean.  Neo's showdown with Smith in the first film was great fun and very exciting.  Here (and in Reloaded) it is an excess of special effects, horribly overblown - visually impressive but not enjoyable.The film seems to have taken on the mantel of 'meaningful epic' where once it was a clever film with no assumptions.  Listen to the music - that's where the clue is.  Instead of the rock mix from the first film it has taken on big sweeping classical pieces that it scatters around liberally to try and give the film an epic feel that it doesn't deserve.  It is still worth seeing as it finishes the trilogy but it is hard work at times.  The acting continues the curse of Reloaded in that everyone thinks they are reading Shakespeare and gives their performance as if they were speaking words direct from God.  Even Weaving's Smith is a little too full of himself this time.  The dialogue is pretty bad as before - full of clichés and over wordy speeches of grandeur, it just gets tiresome before it gets engaging.In the first film we were told no one can be told what the matrix is, we must see it for ourselves.  We were then taken on a journey (with Neo), led by Morpheus into this world that was explained as we went.  Here we are simply dumped in the middle of an impenetrable plot and basically left to work things out for ourselves with little or no help.  Attempts to have characters like the Architect or the Oracle explain things are simply clunky and don't work at all. I'm not adverse to thinking, but the more I think about the film as a series the more i see unanswered holes.  I was hoping that Revolutions would tie things up from Reloaded and actually serve to make part 2 work better, but it didn't.  It took some positive steps but really the same weaknesses just continue.Overall I was glad I saw it to finish the story, and visually it had some very impressive moments.  However the feeling was of a film with no controls, spiralling out of control - with narrative flow lost behind half ideas and spiritual nonsense.  It is over indulgent, bloated and full of a sense of it's own importance - an importance it simply does not have and should not be wearing on it's sleeve.  The Wachowski's created a fascinating universe but, as they opened it out, their egos have inflated the material and their inability to control and tell such a massive story has shown and the last 2 films have really suffered as a result.  Worth watching for what it attempts to do, but ultimately very frustrating for what it actually delivers and, more importantly, what it fails totally to do.",Null,20,36,13 November 2003
Man of Steel," Engaging if superficial darker tone gives way to excessive special effects and noise later in the film – mostly works for what it is though
","When this came out in the cinemas I must admit I didn't really care; the years have left me less inclined to go and sit in packed cinemas full of code-of-conduct breakers only to be disappointed by yet more hollow noise. I had heard the promise of a 'darker' reboot, but the effects heavy trailers and the presence of Zack Snyder at the helm really made me doubt that. However, on a long flight it seemed like a good way to fill the time when I had little else to do, and so I gave it a go. In fairness it is actually not too bad and the negative things I had heard were mostly rather exaggerated and perhaps coming from other agendas rather than meeting the film on its own terms and judging it there.The dramatic opening on Krypton lets you know that this is going to be a film with lots of special effects thrown around but it does at least set the tone well. This continues in the first part of the film where the nicely done structure allows us to have key moments of backstory without the whole film having to go back there and work forward. This section of the film does have some weight to it but could have done more and be more heart-felt. Although it deserves credit for trying, it does feel rather superficial in its delivery, I enjoyed it for the content but would have liked it to be smarter and better. The second half of the film becomes more and more about the action and it is noisily dizzying. I enjoyed it for the spectacle and much of it was well done, but some of the very specific scenes of peril involving very specific characters, could have been cut with no great loss. It uses the dramatic music and dark tone well though to add weight to this – having its cake and eating it in some ways but ultimately it does just become a blur after a whie.The cast probably has too many famous faces but mostly they work while also being a parade of distraction. Cavill makes a likable Superman, although the material never tests his emotional range too much, but just enough to work. Shannon is a very good piece of casting as he brings a really good dark intensity to Zod (as he does to everything) and he adds weight to the character which remains even when he becomes a special effect rather than an actor. Adams is OK but a little out of place – you sense her light, pretty approach is there for the romantic or flirty moments. Costner is solid while Crowe, Lane, Fishburne, Meloni and others do good work. Too many recognizable faces do float around, but it is a big budget movie and this is the danger I guess.Ultimately Many of Steel was better than I expected despite doing just what I thought it would. The darker tone is rather superficial but still just about works although the second half of the film really is just one big effects showcase without too much else to be had. It is noise and distracting for this and it did the job even if I doubt I'll remember much about it when/if a sequel comes around.",Null,5,9,21 October 2013
The Color of Money," The Hustler 2 - did we need it?
","Fast Eddie (Newman) takes top-gun pool player Vincent (Cruise) and his girlfriend Carmen (Mary Stuart Mastrantonio) out on a six week journey to Atlantic City to teach them how to hustle. On the way he struggles with the love of the game that he once had.And that's about it, as a sequel to the Hustler, Colour of Money stands in the shadow of it's big brother as a lesser film. This deals with Eddie as an old man having given up pool for a quieter life. As a character study of Eddie it is quite good, you see his excitement when he's about to do his first hustle in years and his mood when his bitterness and disappointment come through again. The final lines are a little too twee for the film but do leave you with the feeling that you've followed this character as he's tried to come back to his first love. But this character study is not enough to carry the whole film.The rest of the plot relies on Cruise and Mastrantonio to deliver and unfortunately they don't do as well as they could. Mastrantonio is pretty good but doesn't totally convince as someone driven by greed (shown by her robbery background and her partnership with Eddie), she seems 2-dimensional but not shallow. Cruise is too simplistic to play the role of Vincent - he merely bounces between cocky and angry in the role. He didn't have the subtlety needed to pull it off yet. Ultimately he is more annoying than anything else. Interest is held by other actors playing small roles (Iggy Pop, Forest Whitaker, John Turturro) but it's left to Fast Eddie to carry the show.Scorsese piles the visual style on thick and it does help the film immensely. He generates such energy around the pool halls that you can't help but watch during the games (even if you don't fully understand the rules). This is very different from the smoky, shadowy feel of the Hustler but it is a real boost to this film to have him direct. Unfortunately you do feel like you just ate a very light meal afterwards - I got the style, but shouldn't there be more substance?And that's the problem - you do feel that there should have been more. There's tonnes of flashy pool games, inventive camera shots and good music. There's even good character development in Fast Eddie, but you do feel that you've just watched Paul Newman give a great performance in a 2-hour pop music video. This could easily be entitled 'The Hustler 2: Some Things Are Best Left Alone'.",Null,1,8,19 November 2001
28 Weeks Later," Effective horror movie with pace and gore but, surprisingly, not enough in the way of desperation and fear (SPOILERS)
","I'm not ashamed to admit that I avoided this in cinemas because I genuinely find zombie movies terrifying (and yes I appreciate that they are not zombies but infected people here), mostly due to the simple desire to kill and the way that everything we take for granted collapses in regards society, morals etc. It also doesn't help that I'm not a big gore fan either and that I had heard this film was pretty bad for that too. However, as much as it scared me I did 'enjoy' 28 Days Later and did want to see this. So on a windless sunny Saturday morning I finally got round to watching it. The opening sequence is why I both love and hate this genre  it is the utter fear and relentlessness of the infected. I was gripped by the simplicity and desperation of the situation and it very much reminded me of the first half of the original film not only in this regards but also in the way that the basic elements of society are stripped away (in this case self-preservation taking precedence over everything else).Unfortunately, not unlike the first film, a plot is required to move forward with and when this arrives in earnest, so do the problems. The first signs are good as we find ourselves in a scenario that is well constructed around Iraq  with the 'safe' zones etc. Superficially this is very clever and does allow for veiled digs at the US approach out there but wisely it doesn't force this point too much. The film somehow has to get the infection into this safe zone and as many have already said, it does it by making massive leaps of coincidence and absences of logic. The hope would be that these are overlooked because we do quickly get to the outbreak after a comparatively quiet first 40 minutes. However by keeping Don in it, the film actually continually reminds us that, even within the internal logic of the film itself, it doesn't actually make a lot of sense.Keeping him and his family as a thread no matter what is also a problem because the unlikely action takes away from the sense of hopelessness and survival that this genre thrives on. Instead, as we are with the main two characters, I felt a bit remote from this, almost safe  not something I thought I would feel with this film. I don't want to sound too negative though because there are plenty of individual moments are aspects that are very good. Those who have seen Fresnadillo's Intacto will already be aware that while effective story-structuring is clearly not his thing, he is able to direct stylish and slick action. He does it at the start and he does it throughout the majority of the film, even if it is not as good as I would have liked. In '28 Days' we hear about an infected in a crowd and it is a chilling description. '28 Weeks' attempts to show us this but sadly fudges it even if it does try. The outbreak and the loss of control is well done because again it does have that desperate air of fear about it but after this it becomes more variable again. At times we get 'narrow escape' action with 'red shirts' in the group being sacrificed  again keeping the fear a little remote. However at other times we do lose main characters in gripping moments. The design of some scenes is brilliant as well  the night vision journey underground for example.Mostly the horror comes down to being about gore more than fear and I understand why some will appreciate this. For me it just made the film feel a little bit like hard work and gore doesn't draw an emotion from me other than revulsion. You can see the increased budget here because the bloody special effects are impressive throughout. More impressively (for me) are the scenes of a deserted London  which are challenging no matter how much money you have access to. The cast are good but suffer due to the material. You can see why Carlyle was attracted; he delivers the guilt well and it is not his fault that the script keeps him around long after he should have been written out. Renner and Byrne are given more heroic characters and thus take away from this aspect but do manage to carry the basic narrative with solid performances. The two child actors avoid being cute and are reasonably good. I was quite surprised to find Elba and Perrineau (from HBO's The Wire and Oz respectively) involved and, although they have minor characters, they are convincing and have presence. As before, Murphy's score is appropriate and well used.Don't get me wrong by what I am saying  this is gory and quite exciting stuff that has potential in the Iraq parallels to be pretty smart. It is a success but it is a limited one partly due to the inability of the story to overcome some devices of convenience and some downright bad ideas. However for me the thing that was hardest to get away from that the absence of fear as a consistent emotion and, as much as I enjoyed the pace and the ideas, I wanted to be more involved and less of an observer.",Null,19,30,1 December 2007
Cast Away," Slow but engaging drama that is driven by Hanks' brave performance
","Chuck Noland is a driven employee of Fed-Ex.  He has a loving girlfriend and a lifestyle that sees him travelling the world.  When he takes an overnight flight across the Pacific, his plane crashes killing the crew but he escapes on an inflatable dingy.  Washing up on an island Chuck finds himself shipwrecked and must survive until he is found.I wasn't won over by the idea of this film when it came out at the cinema and gave it a miss.  However on TV I'm graceful enough to give anything a chance for free!  In this case I had no hype or bad reviews about the film to colour what I thought of it, coming to it fresh enough to have an open mind.  Fortunately I was in a patient mood and looking forward to seeing it, so it didn't bother me that the film was very slow, although I can understand why some audiences were straining at the leash for more pace. For me the story itself was interesting enough as a human story to defy `things happening' - it was Chuck I was watching the film for, not a fight scene or a dramatic rescue.For this reason the film succeeds - to me it was dramatic and engaging on a character level and, because things were always happening to Chuck, I didn't need some constant bit of plot to be happening.  The film is quite brave in that way and, while other reviewers have criticised the ending, I thought it displayed good taste and control - imagine trying to get that ending through a pitch or a preview audience!  Most films would have looked for a more positive and conclusive ending - but this one was very good.Hanks does great work to hold the attention for the whole film - he is barely off screen for a minute of the whole 120+ minutes.  His performance is good; whether he is acting normal or talking to a volley ball he is convincing and never dull, he makes it very easy for us to get into his character and his situation - which was vital to keep the audience interested.Overall I really enjoyed this film but I do feel you need to be ready for what you're sitting down to.  It is slow paced and, if you're impatient, then you may feel like `nothing's happening'.  Hanks does great to hold the audience otherwise and the film is grown up and lacking in the sort of syrupy smaltz that could have killed the film.  Not perfect but an great story well told if you're in a patient mood.",Null,3,7,30 December 2003
The Thing," Lacks the creepiness of the 1951 version but nevertheless it's a fantastic visual ride
","The staff of an Antarctic research post discover that an extraterrestrial is around that can replicate any living thing.  It's powers are extraordinary and the staff find themselves in a fight for survival.This remake of the classic Howard Hawks film `The Thing From Another World' takes the guts of that story - improves some things but loses others. Obviously the film greatly improves the special effects and frights provided by James Arness in 1951, however it does so at the loss of some of the suspense of the original.  This still has a great feeling of paranoia about it that filters through everything.  The story is basic but it has plenty of chills at the start, but once the effects start we see everything and it's more gross than chilling.That's not to say the effects aren't good.  They still look good now - despite being 20 years old!  It's telling of how much work went into this to reflect that effects wizard Rob Bottin was checked into hospital with exhaustion once the movie was finished.The cast are all pretty good.  Russell is a good lead, although this is more of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle.  The cast are gradually whittled down until they reach the ending that is not only downbeat but subtle and intelligent.  It's flawed if you think about it too much but it works really well after so much gore.Overall it'll never have the classic status of the original but it is definitely a good example of a modern sci-fi that is almost as good as Alien in terms of atmosphere and thrills.",Null,8,17,18 February 2002
Armageddon," Big dumb fun - but far too OTT and far too long
","When several eastern seaboard cities are struck by small meteorites causing significant damage and loss of life the Government look further into space to find a bigger meteorite the size of Texas heading for Earth.  The meteorite will destroy the earth, wiping out all life.  Oil rig owner Harry Stamper and his crew are employed by NASA to join the elite programme put together to destroy the meteorite.  The plan is to drill 800ft into the rock, plant a nuclear device causing the meteorite to split in two, with both pieces missing the Earth.  The team face a huge amount of challenges on the way to their goal.In the summer of two 'danger from space' meteor movies (Deep Impact being the other), this was the less thoughtful but the more enjoyable.  This is very much an action movie, from the first time we see Stamper chasing an employee round an oil rig with a shotgun, we know that we're not in for a thoughtful, reflective film.  Instead this is all about spectacle - New York is destroyed - in fact everything is destroyed!  The training section of the film is funny but again it is all OTT.  The rest of the film is all about action without reason.  For example the team stops at a USSR space station to refuel and blow it up accidentally - that's the way it works, everything they touch explodes.This gets a little tiring after a while and I got to the point where I was almost numb to the action onscreen.  The only breaks from the explosions are scenes of soppy sentiment that don't really work.  In all it never really gets anywhere near a clever film however it's still quite enjoyable in a summer blockbuster kind of way.The cast is superb!  They all play it with their tongue in cheek so they all seem to be having fun.  Willis is good, but his character is stupid and poorly developed.  Thornton, Patton, Buscemi, Wilson, Duncan and Stormare all add class and are good despite the material.  However Affleck and Tyler are both poor, he must be the heroic romantic man and he clearly can't do it (not his fault, his character is far too serious for this) while Tyler is forced to do all the emotional wailing and crying (again not suited to the dumb action stuff).  I could easily have done without both of them to make a better film.Overall, this isn't Shakespeare - it's a dumb action film.  It's constant explosions and stupid action scenes get a bit tiring but it's all packaged together in such a slick way that it's difficult not to enjoy it.",Null,5,10,15 February 2002
The Village," Without the twist there is nothing else to really get into and it is boring and false (this review contains major spoilers for this film and Dark City)
","In the late 19th century a small village lives peacefully in a valley surrounded by woods. The only threat to this peace is those who are not spoken of  a race of strange beast men who live in the woods. Over the years, a truce has developed between the two races where each will stay in their own area. However when skinned animals start to turn up within the boundary, and markings appear on the buildings show that the others appear to be breaking the truce for some reason. Meanwhile, with the death of one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt appeals to the elders to allow him to go to the town to collect medicines  however the elders want the village to continue to be protected from the town.Shyamalan's recent films have tended to divide opinion pretty successfully  with Unbreakable and Signs bringing both praise and derision in pretty equal measure. For the record, I quite liked both of these films but I left the cinema bored and frustrated with a film that offers very little aside from the main twist. The film suggests several narratives but none of them go anywhere but to the twist. The script is full of well-observed detail of the period and lots of character interactions but these are all for nothing because the film is only using them to fill and distract. For this reason the film drags quite a bit and feels a lot longer than it is  time spent on stilted, nervous romances is boring because we suspect (and later know) that they are only being used rather than being intimate background to the main story. With 6th Sense, Signs and Unbreakable I didn't feel that the twist was the whole ballgame  there was a story being told and the twist was the conclusion to it. With The Village I didn't feel the twist was a conclusion to the story  just a conclusion to a premise. In fact the twist can be seen coming and, even if it isn't obvious to you, it is delivered so flatly that it loses its impact  contrast it to the twist in Dark City, it could not have been weaker.Of course, the whole idea is good and it is interesting if you are talking about it  but not if it is stretched out over 2 hours. I watch a great many short films and, trust me, The Village is a short film  albeit a long short film that could run between 30 minutes and an hour. Shyamalan has come up with another premise that gives him his twist but has no substance to it. He adds substance the best he can but he knows that the twist is all and he only adds the substance that he needs to get there. I found this frustrating and rather boring; the characters were thin and only the beasts offer interest (and I suppose at least produce one or two jumps) but again they are nothing more than filler really, part of the twist to the premise  certainly they are not the focal point that the marketing and majority of the film would have you believe. No, they are removed from the film in one quick moment and are only brought back in the form of Noah in order to raise the tempo again and to keep the audience guessing about the twist that they know must be coming; sure, it is a scary moment but it is as fake as the village itself.Despite his failings as writer here, director Shyamalan and his cinematographer do well here and produce a film that looks great and manages to produce some images that are memorable and effective. The village looks great, the forest looks innocent but daunting while the beasts are fleeting and had potential. The use of strong colours is particularly effective thanks to the look of the film  so much of it is washed out that the reds do actually look bad and too strong to really fit in. However this is little consolation to the many of us who will have struggled through what was essentially filler in order to get to a rather unsatisfying twist. I'll accept that it works better when you think about it and that the premise is interesting but as a film it needs to work and it simply doesn't.The cast try hard but, with few characters to go around, many of them struggle  I think that it must have been apparent to them that they are only part of a loose premise to facilitate a twist, they are not meant to do anything other than get the film to the twist. Certainly Phoenix knows this. His performance is fitting to the slow tone of the film and he tries hard but he is betrayed and left with nothing to do. Howard steals the film. Her actions may grate as they seem so very unlikely but her actual performance is very good and she makes a good heart of the film once she is moved into that position in the second half. Brody is OK but is just a plot device to get to the twist. Hurt is strong and delivers well, but people like Weaver and Gleeson really deserve better; they have nothing to do and what little material they have to work with (eg Weaver and Hurt's affection) is only out there to fill and distract  as the twist approaches it is simply forgotten about as if it never mattered, which, I suppose, it never really did.Overall this is not a bad film  just a badly delivered one. The premise is OK but, as others have said, it is a Twilight Zone episode or a short film. Stretched to two hours means that filler is put in, red herrings are thrown in, characters are partially developed but only to fill the gap not as part of writing a good script. Given that the whole point of this film is the twist, I was surprised how very limp it was  at least Shyamalan had the guts to appear on screen himself (as the ranger) to try and justify some of the logic! But it is weak and, although it looks great and had potential, it all amounts to nothing and, unlike his other films that had substance and a twist, The Village has only a premise and then a twist  there is no substance of value here and many viewers will find themselves bored and annoyed.",Null,39,70,9 September 2004
21," Superficially slick but lacking in substance, making it never more than 'OK'
","Ben Campbell is a gifted maths student with dreams of getting into the best university and getting out of his humble Boston roots. The reality is that talent may not be enough and that the costs may be prohibitive. Regardless of his future plans, Ben's maths professor sees other potential and invites him to join a very unusual after-school activity  practising counting cards to beat the odds at the Blackjack table. Why? Well because Professor Rosa's group spends their weekends under assumed identities taking the casino's for tens of thousands of dollars a time. It all seems so simple but is Ben just naive to the risks?One can easily understand what it was about the story that appealed to the makers because, to coin a phrase 'it's Vegas baby!' - the city of women, lights, money, gambling and shows. Hey, if nothing else we have scope of loads of cool slow-mo shots of people walking in casinos, quick-cuts of cards and chips and so on - after all people watch poker etc all the time on TV shows so it is an easy sell. And so what we get in this film is lots of sweeping shots and glamorous locations, none of which ever make you forget that what we're talking about here is maths students using their skills to beat the odds and win money. The only outcome of getting caught appears to be a severe beat from Lawrence Fishburne and being sent on your way with whatever you got before being caught.And that is really the problem that I had with the film is that it didn't have a great deal to offer in the delivery to convince me that I should be interested in it. The true story is enough to make me watch but somehow it doesn't translate into a gripping narrative. The risks aren't all that tangible whereas the earnings are significant to the point where it seems a no-brainer. With this element stuttering the film really could have done with stronger characters to make for a good tale but, as it is, Campbell is a fairly dull subject whose changes are obvious and not that interesting. This just leaves lots of a card games but even without the card counting, blackjack doesn't lend itself to tension and mind-games in the same cinematic way that poker does (and even that is not done that well that often). So the film pushes the easy stuff and loads it up with the visual style that CSI, Oceans Eleven etc have conditioned us to associate with Vegas-set stories.The end result of that is that these scenes do have a bit of pace and energy to them but as soon as this goes away, there is almost nothing of interest to focus on. I was surprised by just how so-so much of the film was and it is hard to ignore that the weakness comes from the lack of substance for the viewer to get into. In the lead Sturgess does OK because his performance feels natural enough and I assumed that with a better script and clearer direction he could have engaged the audience more; as it was his was a case of nice but bland. Spacey does his usual turn and is a good presence but not much more. Fishburne is more realistic than the Ocean's Eleven style casino bosses/heavies but he also comes over a bit toothless at the same time and not that much of a force in the film. Bosworth is a cool love interest though, genuinely cute and works well with her fellow actors even if it must have been tough to generate chemistry with them within the film. Support from the remainder of the group is OK even if their characters are basic.21 is an occasionally slick and cool film based on a true story but it puts all its chips on the stylish and swish Vegas delivery and forgets to spread its bets by working on character, narrative and engaging the audience in more solid ways. This means that at times it feels fresh and cool but ultimately the minute you have to look deeper you find there is surprisingly little to work with. It is still 'OK' but never consistently more than that.",Null,1,4,28 July 2008
He Got Game," Flawed but always interesting
","Jesus Shuttlesworth is the number one hope for college basketball and has offers from colleges and sports agents ringing non-stop.  His father is in jail for the manslaughter of his wife but is allowed out by the Governor for 4 days with a promise of further leniency if he can convince his son to go to Big State University.  However Jesus has never forgiven him and this pressure, on top of everything else, is the last thing he needs.I'm never too sure what I'm going to take away from this film each time I watch it, as it does tend to try and cover a lot of ground.  Is the film about father/son relationship?  Is it about the commercialisation of school sports?  Or pressure on young athletes?  It's hard to be sure and I'm not sure that Lee is totally sure either.  As such it often leaves me searching for an adequate way to summarise what I just watched.  Regardless I do feel that the film manages to cover a lot of bases well.  The stuff about the sports system is well worked without ramming down your throat  the exaggeration (or is it?) of the characters and scenarios is good and makes for good satire of sorts.The central relationship between Jake and Jesus is also worked well through several key scenes throughout the film.  It leaves questions open during the film and at the end, but I guess there aren't always answers for everything and that's the way it is.  The dynamic between the two is good though and it makes for an interesting plot  even though it does often feel like a subplot behind the basketball stuff.  Other bits of the film don't fare as well.  The two romantic strands are not as good as they should be  certainly Jake's scenes with Dakota are less than inspiring.The cast are all pretty good.  Allen does OK but occasionally looks out of his depth with the talented cast.  The array of basketball players and associates all add colour whether as themselves or playing characters. Washington carries the majority of the film and shows his ability in a difficult role  he became the heart of the film for me even though I'm sure the intention was for that to be Jesus.  Dawson plays well despite being eye candy for the majority, she does have better scenes near the end of the film.  The support cast have a few Lee regulars including an amusing Turturro, a convincing Palagonia and a blink and you'll miss her Jennifer Esposito.Overall this is not a perfect film as it overstretches itself a little and doesn't manage to deal with everything as well as it could have done. Ironically the overstretching is also a plus point as, every time I watch it, it gives me something else to concentrate on.

The Revenant," Handsomely made, compelling in its brutality, but narratively a bit too simple
","It is good to be wary around this time of year because with the Oscars and many other awards imminent, there is a tendency for studios to release 'worthy' films – many of them are really good too, but a lot of them are 'worthy'. It is hard to say which one The Revenant is, but it does certainly seem like a film where everyone went through a lot of physical hardship. I don't read around films much, so I'm guess on that, but the on-location shoot and freezing conditions seem too tangible for them not to have made the shoot a long and challenging one. If so then it paid off because this aspect of the film is by far the strongest element – the brutality, the fight for survival, and the contrast of these tiny people against the vastness of the landscape.As such it is the technical delivery which is really the star. It is a consistently impressive and handsome film - whether it is the CGI bear of the opening 30 minutes, or cinematography which manages to have both nimble movement in/around the action as well as taking in the sweeping vistas as it reproduces the cold onto the screen. This aspect of the film carries it a long way, because for the most part this is a dialogue-free affair as Glass pulls himself from death to try and get revenge on another character. As a journey it is a tough slog and unfortunately it partly becomes that for the viewer too, because the film does have a slow pace and is essentially a slow crawl to its target. It does enough with the atmosphere to ensure the viewer is in the mindset where this works well, but it is not the type of film that one would throw on for a relaxing Friday night in. It is an odd feeling, but for me the time did not drag, and I was help by its single minded and consistent brutality, but at the same time it was not a story I felt gripped by in the detail of the character – more the overall experience.The story does have the constant theme of parents and children. Of course this is the motivation for the revenge plot, but it is also behind the group of Native Americans who are also integral in the film; and of course the bear attack itself is a parent acting in defense of its cubs. This element is interesting but it doesn't always work. In the main plot it feels just like a plot device (which it is) and the floaty other-worldly connection to the dead wife doesn't chance that. The other father, hunting his daughter, doesn't bring a great deal to the film in terms of emotional content and, being honest, the only parent/child relationship that I really felt for was the bear cubs left behind by the death of their mother (I know, typical liberal watching people die but getting teary over the animals).The cast match the sense of brutality, and they wear it well in their characters. DiCaprio of course gets the headlines, but others are just as strong and one could argue that Tom Hardy really gets the best of the film as he gets all the good lines, has the most tangible character, and where the film has standout scenes, he is mostly in them. The technical delivery is the overall star though, because it is a film that is handsome, very well made, and has a lot to like in the look, atmosphere and sound work throughout.In this way it is more than worth a look, and it is compelling in what it does, even if at the same time it is not as strong in the characters and their stories as it is in the creation of this atmospheric struggle to survive.",Null,3,5,6 March 2016
Pitch Black," Enjoyable  but visually a mixed bag and lacking in originality
","When something goes wrong in a deep space crossing, a passenger ship crashes on a desolate planet losing most of it's load along the way.  Once on the surface they discover signs of past human life and soon discover that the planet is populated by dangerous creatures.  They discover that the creatures come out at night to feed just as a solar eclipse begins.  The crew's only hope of survival is one of the passengers  a dangerous murderer with the ability to see in the dark.This film has the reputation as being Vin Diesel's breakthrough movie and I therefore expected it to be pretty good.  The plot is quite clever if you say the whole `seeing in the dark' thing, but really this is more of a plot device than a plot  the actual plot will not surprise anyone who's seen any alien movies before.  The cast are eaten one by one  you don't have to look at your watch to see if the film is nearly over, just count the number of characters left onscreen!  There are some exciting moments in the second half and the film manages to be enjoyable without being that good.I understood that Riddick can see in the dark, but didn't get why (at the start) he was walking round in daylight and the characters seemed unable to see him.  His being able to see in the dark is also a bit of a leap and all smacks of lazy writing if you ask me  it would have been better to not have this twist rather than making it feel like it was forced.  The actual aliens themselves are not well designed  when half seen they are fast and exciting, however seen in more detail they are quite basic or, as my friend said, look like Big Bird's cousin.The film is really over-edited which in one way works but in others doesn't. The thing I liked was the use of washed out film stocks to show different times of day and to give a different feel to every part of the film. However the constant jump cuts etc just got annoying and suggested a director who lacks confidence and has to resort to visual excess to compensate for his lack of faith in the film to carry itself.The cast are all pretty awful if you ask me.  Diesel does have a good screen presence, even if he is lacking in charisma (in my opinion).  He is just like a young muscle man actor but does quite well here I suppose.  At least, he does in comparison to the support cast who are all clichés who await their death scenes with impatient hamming and cardboard delivery.Overall this is an average film as it lacks any new ideas (other than the central one) and feels like a retread of other films.  Visually bits of it are impressive but then other bits just are over the top, edited to within an inch of it's life for no benefit.  I enjoyed it but really failed to see what all the fuss had been about in the first place.",Null,4,7,30 September 2003
Split," Feels like a first draft, albeit one with strong performances and decent premise
","It was the recent release of Glass that made me decide to watch this film, despite its so-so reviews; I wanted to watch the former, and it didn't feel right to skip right to it. The film opens with a creepy setup, and gradually plays out the multiple personalities of the main characters, while at the same time increasing the tension through the peril of the young women trapped somewhere. In terms of stakes and tension, it mostly does it well, with an escalation as the film goes, but the film is not tight enough to be event driven, and at two hours there is lots of material which seemed intended to do something, but mostly doesn't deliver.It is an odd film in this way, because there is a lot here to work with, but too much of it is superficial. It plays very much like a first or second draft; so for example there are elements so undercooked that it feels like the type of material that would have been taken out later down the road to try to make more space for other elements, or just recognizing that it adds time but not value. Casey's flashbacks add almost nothing - not because they are a bad idea, but because they are not worked through enough; the film would have lost almost nothing by removing them. Likewise, the battle within the main character doesn't have a sense of struggle really; it could have been much more, and thus the conclusion could have been more impacting, but it doesn't have much in the way of weight or emotion behind it. Again, there was much more writing and refining to be done here.It is a shame, because the cast deserve more than they have to work with. McAvoy is great as he slips between characters totally convincingly; he throws himself into this and almost singlehandedly makes the film worth seeing. Taylor-Joy is almost as good because of how she plays her fear; while the film doesn't help the viewer connect to her 5-year old self, the actresses seems to have found it, and there is more in her performance than the film lets us see. Probably the blame should be laid at the feet of Shyamalan; he wrote and directed this, and it is very his type of weakness - he wants the concept and idea to be the thing, but the depth etc he is not often able to find. The film running long and having too much in it is probably down to him too - editor Ciarrocchi seems to have his career thanks to Shyamalan, so he is unlikely to be tough in the edit.Split squanders a lot - a couple of very good performances, and a generally interesting concept and through-line mostly. It lays out its plot in semi-cooked chunks and then serves them up like an early draft - some of it needed chucking, and the rest needed improving; but it doesn't do either.",Null,0,1,22 September 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Solidly entertaining despite feeling a bit like it's in a holding pattern but helped by the very dark tone to this penultimate film
","Voldemort's power is increasing and has taken control of Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic. Those standing against him have fled to regroup in a safer place albeit at great personal risk to themselves in their attempts to protect Harry. When Harry decides to find the rest of the Horcruxes to be able to defeat him, his friends agree to join him. However as darkness grows in the world at large, the trio find themselves facing impossible odds as they discover that Voldemort is pursuing three powerful objects of legend in the world of magic.It took quite a few films but once the series moved away from the introductory stages and got darker, I have started to enjoy them a lot more. OK, I'm not into the story so much that I'm frantic for the final film to come but I am finding the dark tone and content to be much more engaging and satisfying than the more colourful opening films. So I come to the penultimate in the series – although it is the final book split into two parts, which is the better decision since this film runs a bit too long while only covering half of it! HP7a wastes no time in getting dark as we open with several scenes of danger and it sets the tone for the rest of the film where there are many sequences and events that will challenge younger viewers. As an adult (of sorts) I enjoyed this and found that it made the danger more real within the film and thus engaged me more. It needed to do this because there are longer sections of the film where the main characters are hiding out and the drama is between them; these didn't work as well for me because I have less of myself invested in them as people, however they are well interspersed with action so that it never really feels like it is sagging too much.Of course sagging (or rather, lack of conclusion) is a bit of a problem in the film because it is only half of it. The ending in particular does provide a cliff hanger but it doesn't manage to overcome the feeling that, like the lead three, we're waiting for something to happen for a lot of the film rather than actually having a lot happen. It does still work though and I mostly enjoyed it; it helps a lot that the film looks great and that the special effects work to assist the dark content. The cast are reasonably good although some of the dialogue in the character driven scenes I did find a little clunky. The lead three have grown into the parts and mostly they avoid melodrama when there is tension between them. The support cast are generally strong and made up of essentially every living British actor doing small turns to good effect.Harry Potter 7a is not a brilliant film by any means and it does struggle with the fact that it is waiting for the conclusion rather than being the conclusion. However it does provide frequent dark sections and action which keep it lively but have the downside of risking frightening away younger viewers. This dark tone does really make it for me as the film engaged me by just how bleak it was in terms of content and cinematography and, while it is understandably not as good as I would have liked, I did enjoy it and I am now looking forward to a conclusion that can keep this dark, adult tone but also bring everything to a close.",Null,1,2,5 April 2011
Cold Mountain," As a romance it stutters but it is a fabulous story of war
","In the months before the civil war, Ada Monroe moves to Cold Mountain, North Carolina with her father and meets Inman briefly before he goes to war. They fall for each other in this brief period and she writes to him constantly.  Injured in a major attack he receives a letter from her that her father is dead and she needs him to return.  He steals away from the hospital despite risk of being shot as a deserter.  At Cold Mountain, Ada gets the help of Ruby Thewes to run her farm and try to get by without a man.The trailer had failed to grab me and the mixed reviews hadn't exactly got me rushing into my local cinema, however a wet and cold morning helped me decide that it was a better bet than the January sales!  The film opens well with a great battle sequence that leads to flashbacks to show how Ada and Inman's romance began.  At this point the film stutters because the brief interaction between the two was not strong enough to get me totally behind Inman's quest to return to her.  If the whole film had relied on this then it would have been a problem - however it manages to keep moving as a story of the impact of war rather than a love story.The two strands of this tale work well as separates and the film seems to know this and doesn't labour the romance too much during the body of the film, preferring instead to let the stories work in their own right. Towards the end the film relies heavily on the audience caring about Ada and Inman, however this just about manages to work because I cared about them as individuals even if their love was something that hadn't been made real to me.The cast risk mockery with them having to all do accents that don't come naturally to them.  Law is very strong and he holds the attention as our eyes on the story.  Kidman is very good but she doesn't physically change as her emotional change would require.  Zellweger was a bit full on for my tastes but her character does help liven up her side of the story. Sutherland is good and the support cast of characters met alone the road includes Winstone, Gleeson, Hoffman, Ribisi and Portman - each of who does more than simply make an `oh look it's ..' appearance.Overall this was not as strong as it could have been because the film can't manage to develop a convincing enough bond between Inman and Ada.  Without this parts of the story stutter but what works regardless is Inman's journey though a country torn apart by war and Ada's struggle of women of the time left behind by the men who went off to die.",Null,6,11,1 January 2004
Kung Fu Panda 2," Enjoyable family film that adds a bit of darkness, and a lot of scale, to the strengths of the first film
","I'd not seen the first Kung-Fu Panda film since it had come out in the late noughties, and I hadn't seen any of the other ones at all until it my toddler started watching them and I picked up 2 and 3 for her. After watching the first one loads, I managed to move her to the second, for my own variety as much as anything else. The plot sees Po trying to settle into his new role as Dragon Warrior, at the same time as a banished son returns to the city to use a new powerful weapon to seize control of the city and country. It has a slightly darker tone than the first film, because it touches on Po's backstory, and it carries itself with more dramatic sequences than the first film did (where we only got to see the power and anger of Tai Lung in a handful of scenes - mostly the film was about Po's training).This slightly extra weight adds to the characters and the narrative, and at the same time the scale of the film feels bigger as we move into a city, with the stakes high. This means the action sequences feel like they mean more, and in return the actions is bigger, more polished, and fits well with the gravity-defying excess of the genre that the film is referencing and drawing from. It did this well in the first film too, but here it feels much more satisfying in the scale of it all. At its heart though the film remains funny, entertaining, easy for families, and with good moral messages throughout. As with the first film, the use of Chinese culture swings from mostly feeling well used and cleverly adopted, to being a bit cheap - but mostly it works well.Animation and production is of a very high standard, and the voice cast is even deeper than in the first film, with people like Oldman, Yeoh, Haysbert, Garber, Van Damme, and McBride joining an already very starry cast. Black doesn't always work for me, but he keeps Po funny but likeable, while Oldman manages to bring gravity to his performance and have good comic timing too.In my mind, the Kung-Fu Panda films were sort of 'lesser' films because I always saw Pixar's deeper content as being superior to Dreamworks stuff, however this second film lifts from the already good first, and is a very enjoyable and satisfying family film.",Null,3,3,2 June 2019
American Psycho," Not perfect but much better than the self indulgent book
","Patrick Bateman works on Wall Street for a major accounting firm.  He lives in a life that is material to the extreme and is more about where you can get reservations at than what you do with your life, where conversations never go deeper than music and the ultimate status symbol is the business card.  However Patrick Bateman is also a serial killer who mutilates colleagues, homeless people, call girls, anyone he can in order to try and feel something.  This film is his confession in his attempt to feel something.I must be totally honest and say that I hated the book.  I hated it to the point that, although I normally take old books to a charity shop, I simply put this one in the bin after I had read it as I didn't want to be responsible for anyone else reading it.  The concept of the book was good and it made it's sole point within the first few chapters.  After this point it simply made the same point over and over and over again in a very thick book that seemed to take pleasure from writing about increasingly violent murders.  At the end of the book I sensed that the author had long forgotten the point he had set out to make and was more concerned with shocking or sickening me.  So when the film came out I simply ignored it as I didn't want any more of my cash to go to this hack.However it came onto terrestrial tv recently and I thought I would give it a try, although I was ready to turn it off if I saw it going the same road. Surprisingly the film is good where the book was awful.  Both make the same point but one makes it in 90 minutes where the other makes it over hundreds of pages.  The film uses violence sparingly, mostly occurring off screen or in the imagination where the book lavished in it's increasing gore.  The effect of this is that the film is much more focused and controlled and works a lot better as a satire on the emptiness and shallow nature of our society.  It is set in the eighties but I feel it still applies today and Bateman could easily be any Western businessman whose concerns are so trivial on a global scale but so important to him/her.The film doesn't labour this point but is able to pick the strongest parts of the book to good effect.  Of course it still isn't perfect and it may seem a little hollow to some (but that is the point I guess) and some may miss the point.  The fact that a sequel has been made that is a straight slasher movie suggests to me that a large section of the audience missed the boat totally.  The main reason this film worked for me was a perfectly cast Bale.  He is a perfect Bateman and is almost otherworldly in his delivery, getting the dead eyed look of Bateman perfectly and contrasting it with his excited chatter on music and his sheer disregard for everything but himself. The support cast is surprisingly well known (Lucas, Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe) but it is Bale's film all the way and easily one of his best performances.Overall this film is not perfect and won't be to everyone's taste.  However just remember that I hated the book with a passion and I still liked the film.  The short running time makes for a more focused approach, the more controlled violence means it doesn't get distracted and a perfect performance from Bale keeps it all on track.  Much better than the horrid book from which it came.",Null,11,25,8 June 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," Imperfect but sweetly quirky and enjoyable (spoilers)
","Olive's family is kindly described as dysfunctional. Her father Richard aspires to be an inspiration speaker and writer with his 'nine steps to success' programme. Her brother Dwayne has taken a vow of silence until he achieves his goal of being a pilot. Her uncle Frank is staying with them because he has tried to kill himself after personal and professional issues. Her grandfather has been kicked out of his nursing home for heroin use and now lives with them. Olive herself has the ambition to succeed in beauty contests and her ambition appears to be close to fulfilment when the winner of a contest is dethroned, making Olive the winner and the entrant into a regional competition happening this weekend. With few options, the whole family board their VW camper van and head out on the road.Regardless of the hype the basic plot summary made it sound like a car crash waiting to happen. I wonder, will lessons be learnt and family barriers broken down during the road trip? Of course this occurs but the quirky sweetness is both the making of it and the breaking of it. On one level the film works so well because it manages to avoid the emotional traps of the clichés in the script by being so very different in its approach. This is true of the characters, the plot and the conclusion, all of them having a semblance of the cliché but yet developing along some sort of quirky parallel path. The downside of this is that at times it goes too far. Personally for me this was the actions immediately following the death of the grandfather  I found them too extreme and unlikely and the quirk factor was pushed too high.As it was though, the sweet quirkiness turned this around after a short time and we were back on level ground. It isn't a perfect film by any means but this approach did help make it so much more that it could have been (imagine the exact same plot delivered as a daytime melodrama to see what I mean about the importance of the tone and approach). The direction is good, again feeding the quirky indie feel with the music and framing of shots. The cast work well because mostly they manage to fit with the quirky approach but not totally lose their characters in there. Breslin is a wonderful little girl, effortlessly real and sweet but not in the sickly, precocious way that some can be. In terms of performances, the adult cast do dominate her though as they deliver more. I enjoyed the way that Kinnear and Collette worked off one another as the couple and they, rather than Olive, provided a lot of the heart of the film. Carell was not a total revelation but he wasn't far off  it is the first serious role I have seen him do and he did it very well. Dano is moody for the most but delivers when it is asked of him, while Arkin is a terrific character that brought a lot of humour to the film.Overall it is perhaps too quirky for its own good and it does really skate a fine line. Mostly though it works and the quirky sweetness (assuming you are into it) does carry it though the moments where it pushes the boundary of quirky and threatens to become silly or quirky for its own sake. Not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination and I do feel it has been hyped more than it deserves but regardless it is charming and enjoyably disarming.",Null,3,9,14 October 2007
North by Northwest," Classic thriller - I love it!
","Roger Thornhill is an advertising man.  However when he is kidnapped it is clear that he has been mistaken for someone else.  When he tries to find out what's going he is framed for murder and sets out on a cross country run to survive.  Along the way he meets danger, adventure and beauty in the shape of the mysterious Eve Kendall.  However when he finds the truth he is drawn towards a final showdown with the dangerous Vandamm.Rightly regarded as a classic and can more than compete with today's thrillers that too often rely on special effects to make up for the lack of genuine suspense.  Here the plot requires a great deal of faith, but it is brought off with such style and energy that it is totally absorbing.  The action is great and the several main scenes have become part of popular culture and are regularly spoofed on TV etc.  The romance works as well and Thornhill and Kendall exchange plenty of good scenes.The dialogue is great and the direction is faultless from Hitchcock.  Many thrillers run over 2 hours - but only the good ones can stand up to repeated viewings.  Northwest can take back to back viewings it is so good.  The plot may have been put together as shooting went (as was the case with at leastone key scene) but it all stands together well.  The acting is also perfect, Grant's rebirth as a thriller man is brilliant and is one of Hitchcock's best everyman characters.  Marie-Saint is yet another dangerous blonde but is very good. James `The Voice' Mason is excellent, while Landau adds great homosexual subtext to his character.  The ever present Leo G Carroll IS Mr Waverly but is still enjoyable and even support roles like Landis as Thornhill's mother is perfection!Over 40 years on this film has barely dated. Hearing the music is enough to make me want to see it again, while the direction, set pieces, dialogue and performances are all pitch perfect.  A wonderful thriller for young and old - no sex, no swearing, all thrills.",Null,72,99,27 July 2002
Knowing," So-so creepy thriller that has a good atmosphere that covers up its many other weaknesses
","When a time capsule is ceremonially dug up after 50 years in the ground, all schoolboy Caleb Koestler gets is a page with a list of number on it. He takes it home and by coincidence his grieving astrophysicist father Jon spots a pattern. He spends all night going through the numbers finding, among the meaningless numbers, dates and numbers that relate perfectly to events and how many people died in them. Almost unable to believe it himself, he is scorned by his friends until the next 'event' happens just as the list of numbers predicted. John tries to prevent the next event from happening while his son appears to be somehow connected to the predictions.Knowing got a fairly average critical response when it came out and it was sufficient to make me wait for the DVD to come out rather than shell out for a couple of people to see it on separate tickets. Perhaps this is why I was pleasantly surprised by the majority of the film. I'm not suggesting that the film is inherently a good one but it did do a good job of holding my attention for the most part. It managed this by producing a creepy air and tension throughout the telling that made me ignore the massive jumps the plot makes along the way. The effects help it because they are too 'harsh' to be 'fun' – blockbusters often show destruction but do it in a popcorn type way – here I winched while watching people burn to death screaming – not fun but it helps with the air of tension and drama. It cannot do enough though because the writing still is hard to swallow, with lots of convenience about the writing, from the obvious bigger picture stuff right down to niggles about why John appears to not read the remaining events until they become the next one to happen! The film tries to have this dumbness lead into a sort of religious conclusion that is religious but also not religious at the same time. It is a real love it or hate it ending and for me it was more towards the 'hate it' end of the spectrum. Not because it was religious but more because it just seemed so easy and a bit daft. Also it put me off that it couldn't decide to be religious or not, preferring to try and cover all bases by suggesting god, aliens, other planets, heaven etc without making a decision – this is why I didn't really like the ending. Normally I would not have bothered with this because of Nic Cage but he is OK. He is overly earnest for the most part but the film needs him to do that, helping the viewer get into the tension of it all. Canterbury is not much cop but fills the role without being a sickly sweet kid, which I guess is a victory or sorts. Donnellan does reasonably well while Maloney's still 'stranger' is effective in adding to the chill of it all.Overall though it is still a daft supernatural film that relies heavily on the creepy air and urgency to cover up how weak the plot is. The ending will please as many as it annoys I guess and ultimately the film is only an OK one – not a good one.",Null,4,8,20 August 2009
Coriolanus," Not a total success but engaging and well acted
","Not only had I never seen this Shakespeare play before seeing this film, I had never even heard of it and came to it with no lofty ideals or preconceptions about how it should be done or any protectionist feelings towards the text. I mention this because I have read several reviews from critics trying harder to show how intelligent they are rather than reviewing the film but mainly because I have no idea about what this film version has taken out of the original story, or how it has changed the focus, so please bare with me if I am incorrect in something as I only have the film here to go on.Not having ever heard of the play before did give me pause, because I assumed there must be a reason why it is less well-known and less performed than other Shakespeare work – perhaps it isn't that good or it is very difficult as a body of text? I didn't know but I think part of it may be that Coriolanus is a fairly stand-offish character throughout the story. Again, remembering that I'm not familiar with the text, it surprised me that Shakespeare doesn't really give his lead character any 'to-camera' dialogue whereby we learn more of his inner motives and feelings, it is normally such a common device that I wondered why it wasn't done here because at times the character seems quite closed off. In addition to this the character is very proud, which is the point of the tragedy and he is hard to feel for because he is so very trapped behind this wall he has made himself – unable to let even a slight offence pass and happen to burn his city to the ground due to an insult cooked up by media manipulation. It works but he is not the most engaging Shakespearean character I've seen.The contemporary setting is interesting as a background because it does seem to fit the story pretty well, in particularly the tribunes/journalists twisting the people to feel a certain way while the political classes both sneer at the people but say the right things. Some have commented on how timely the film in because it fits in with news footage of people rioting against their ruling classes, however I actually thought that this was an unfortunate distraction because the film doesn't work as a comment on real life nor does is it really able to do much. So while it is background all this is fine but there are occasions where I felt the 'news footage' aspects were being pushed to the fore where really this is about the handful of main characters – not about making a comment on current political unrest.The cast deal well with this distraction though and as is so often the way there are lots of good performances which help to make the material easier to understand thanks to the contextualising of their delivery. Fiennes is very tight and controlled in his performance which is part of his character's nature but it does unfortunately mean he is shut off from the viewer in the way others are not. Butler manages well with the lines but never doesn't feel like an odd casting choice. Cox, Nesbitt and others are well used but the most fascinating performance is from Redgrave as she is great in every scene she is in; I wanted more from her in terms of time and I got the feeling that background matters were pushing the film away from letting this central mother/son relationship be the core of the film.Coriolanus is a good film; it is easy to follow and has great flow to the dialogue but it does suffer from its main character being shut off by his pride and not having many opportunities to let the viewer inside. Perhaps this is why it is a lesser-performed play compared to others, but it does make it a little more difficult to go along with the film even if it overall is still worth seeing.",Null,1,3,5 June 2012
Hugo," Meandering but charming family film
","With Scorsese as director and it being a big adoption of 3D by a 'proper' director, this film made quite a stir when it came out and I always meant to watch it but somehow never did get to it. I finally did this weekend, although of course watched it in 2D and, to be honest, didn't see that I was missing too much by doing so. The film seems to have been a personal one for Scorsese as I remember him talking about wanting to make something that his grandchildren could enjoy while they were still children and in addition to this it is about a love of cinema, a love of wonder and making something that has this effect.Hugo doesn't quite produce the emotions that we see drawn from the characters within the film, but it is still a warm and charming film. The plot has the theme of making things work and things having a purpose and this is well enough laid out to have an impact and work within the narrative. The pace is sometimes a little bit too slow and the film could have been a bit shorter and tighter with a tad more ruthlessness with the editing, because it does occasionally feel like it is meandering a bit as opposed to getting where it needs to go. I did not mind this so much as I was enjoying the tone of it, but it was still an issue. Given the subject matter, I really appreciated that it never gave way to easy sentiment nor got soapy – it was honest in this way and I think a better film for it.The direction is good in the shots and movement of the camera, while the film feels like it has real passion and excitement for what it is doing, which comes over. Performances are engaging. Butterfield is really good in the title role and he works well with Kingsley in a delicate performance. Moretz was solid but left the detail to these two leads. Cohen provides some comic relief and I liked his wandering accent, while Winstone, Lee, de la Tour (!), Griffiths, Law, Eldon and others are all there to provide good small turns and add presence.Generally Hugo is a bit too slow and long for its own good but even with this it has a warm, consistent heart which makes for a charming film with good performances. It may not fill you with awe and wonder as the characters in the film are, but it is still a charming and cheering family film without a mean bone or a sentimental bone in its body.",Null,1,1,15 December 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable film
","In 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job.  He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him.  In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster.  Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them.  As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out.  In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters.  In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not.  However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor.  Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene.  However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc.  I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy.  The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology.  The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all.  Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it.  For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good.  In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good.  The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well.  Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else.  Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do.  The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time.  The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending.  I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch.  Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",Null,92,157,1 September 2003
The Orphanage," Effective chiller that builds the scares on the base of a strong story
","As a child Laura was in an orphanage until she was adopted young. Years later she has returned to the building with her husband and adopted child Simón with the aim of making it both their home and also a place for the care of special children.. Simón has his own challenges, one of which is his reliance on imaginary friends, but when he claims to have met one in particular, Tomás, things take a very dark turn for the worse.After a few weeks of listening to mark Kermode praising this film, I got myself along to a cinema to see it. What I found was not the amazing, earth-shattering film that some had claimed  but this is a common thing for good foreign films, they tend to be extra praised because they are foreign. Don't let my sentences put you off though because this is a very effective and enjoyable ghost story. Director Bayona uses the devices that you'll have seen other films of the same ilk using but the thing is he does it really well. The creeping camera is used several times without a related payoff, producing a constant air of tension that is almost a relief (in a perverse way) when a proper scare does come. As many others have said it is very unnerving rather than gory, with slow movement replacing jump scares and so on, all to good effect.The story is no slouch either and it is built on the desperation of Laura and the loss of her treasure. This puts a very human heart to the ghost story, engaging the viewer and making it easier for scepticism to be put to one side, even if only for a few hours. The narrative carries a satisfying arch that is ultimately as tragic as it is 'happy' and as relatable as it fantastic. To put it another way, when a specific scare was not happening/about to happen, I was still interested in what was happening and boredom never occurred. The cast deliver well too. Rueda is the heart of the film and she is convincing throughout. Cayo's Carlos is a lot less important but he plays his character well. Príncep's Simón is the right kid for the job as his matter-of-fact lack of fear adds to the story. The rest of the child cast are weaker but mostly their creepy silent presence is all that is required.The Orphanage is not anything new or brilliant then but it is very efficient and effective. The story is a strong base for a consistently creepy air that is expertly delivered by Bayona, who makes it all look easy.",Null,5,7,29 May 2008
U-571," An enjoyably tense war movie despite the obvious issues
","The Atlantic is a hunting ground for the German U-Boats as the British and Allied forces are unable to crack their codes and their convoys are easily picked off.  When a U-Boat is damaged it sends out a distress signal to Berlin for rescue.  The signal is intercepted and the Royal Navy is sent out in a S-boat to reach the U-Boat first, board it, claim the Enigma machine that allows the U Boats to translate the code, sink the boat and return to base.  They board the U Boat but the S boat is attacked and sunk by another U Boat leaving some of the crew on board the U Boat.  With no other way to transport the Enigma home they take control of the U Boat and make the perilous journey home.I approached this film on the back of knowing about the real life scenario and must admit to being a little snotty about the depiction of the men involved in this part of war history as Americans rather than British.  To get it out of the way, those involved were actually of the Royal Navy and these events happened several months before America got involved in WWII.  I felt that, because the film was an American film then let them do what they want  as long as they acknowledge the real situation (which they do just before the credits).  I'd rather the film was made and audiences inspired to find out more rather than way for the British industry to have the capacity to make such a film.So away from the controversy (which is understandable after all) the film is actually a solid war movie that mixes silent tension with moments of action (to keep the punters happy).  It is by no means a perfect film but it is enjoyable nonetheless.  It manages to move along quite well and do the traditional thing of having men valiantly giving up their lives etc for their country.  It is not as amazing as I'd have hoped, but I must admit that it is because I'm used to seeing American movie stars doing amazing things  so this felt very ordinary.  I countered this by thinking of English sailors doing the same and that enabled me to feel more involved in the film  perhaps a cast of unknowns (British or American) would have been better.  However I still enjoyed the film as a solid war thriller.The cast is probably too all star for it's won good.  It has a mix of well known named as well as familiar faces.  McConaughey is a good lead and has a more complex character than he might have had in a film such as this. Harvey Keitel has less to do than I had hoped, as did Bill Paxton.  Happily Bon Jovi is quickly forgotten and the American crew of the U Boat are all pretty good despite their lacklustre credits outside of this film.It may take extreme liberties with history and it may over-egg the action scenes somewhat (witness a destroyer go up like a firework factory with just one torpedo) but it is an enjoyable thriller anyway.  Yes the flag waving side of it may be wrong in terms of the flag, but at least it does acknowledge who really was responsible for this heroic part of wartime history, albeit it as part of the end credits.  Despite all this, as a film it is quite enjoyable and that's that.  Watch this as a movie  if you want the real story and the real people involved then there are plenty of good books and documentaries out there on this subject.",Null,0,2,13 July 2003
The Shining," A classic horror from a master director
","When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.",Null,163,234,29 October 2001
"I, Robot"," A clichéd cop thriller crossed with sci-fi but it is noisy, enjoyable fun - all a summer action film should be
","It is the year 2035 and the world has forgotten the lessons we learnt in the 20th Century from films like Bladerunner and Terminator. Robots are the new must have accessory, carrying out menial tasks for households and boosting profits for businesses that have workforces not requiring payment. While this is now the norm, Officer Del Spooner refuses to move with the times and, due to an incident in his past refuses to accept the robots as anything approaching human. When an old friend, Dr Lanning  head of the robotics company, is found dead everyone suspects suicide but Spooner suspects a robot that flees the crime scene. Despite the robotics company lawyering up, Spooner continues his investigations and, several more malfunctions later, he begins to uncover a much bigger problem with the robots.When the film opens with a flashback scene that cuts to a bitter, old-fashioned cop who dresses like Shaft and don't take no rubbish from his weary captain I immediately started to worry that this would simply be a clichéd cop thriller in fancy clothes and, in some ways, that is what it was. But it is also good fun and, along with Spiderman 2, stands out as one of the best of this years generally disappointing crop of blockbusters. The plot is interesting enough to keep the film going and, although it goes just where you will expect it to if you've seen Terminator (or had any involvement in popular culture) it builds gradually with an intriguing investigation leading to a very impressive climax. The set pieces are well directed and are mixed well with the drama and the film delivers just what I had come expecting  fun, excitement, effects and an involving story.Of course this is not to ignore the fact that the film has its weak points. The worn 'tough cop' clichés are heavy on the ground and show a script that hasn't put as much effort into its characters as it really should have  this is also seen in Calvin, who's background with Lanning is hinted at but never followed though. The film also hints at a very intelligent story around the robots but again it never totally follows through in as much detail as it could have done. The structure of the society is not clear  if robots have taken many jobs how can everyone afford a robot? Spooner lives in a poor, overcrowded area with graffiti on the walls but yet everyone owns a robot. While I accept that the film couldn't go into the whole universe behind the scenario, it could have shown us an underclass just as easily as it showed us what I suspect were the middle classes. Likewise the final shot of the film implies that there is more to the robot-ethics of the story but mostly this is put to the side in favour of running and shooting. But these are minor complaints when you accept that this is not art  it is a blockbuster and, in this way, it succeeds and is an enjoyable film. Matching the lazily written character that he is given, Smith plays it like Shaft. He eats pie and takes lots of sugar (but yet has a superb body  can't wait for that part of the future!), makes wisecracks and sneers a lot.He tries to bring something individual out in Spooner but mostly he settles for playing along with the clichés and delivers a familiar performance but one that fits well with the aims of the film. Moynnahan is a bit dry but actually works better than the usual screaming love interest that we get served with  thankfully the film resists the temptation to impose a romance on us. Tudyk looks the part and does a very good 'HAL' voice but he is constrained by his character and can only work within that  but he works it well enough. Greenwood is a good part, Cromwell's familiarity helps us care for a character who has died before the film even starts, McBride is the gruff, weary captain but basically the film is Smith's and his Shaft is quite fun. Outside of the real things, the effects are great  they look real and match the design of the future which is at the other end of the scale from the usual grim future that we all suspect will be nearer the truth! Alex Proyas may not be a great master of the narrative but he does OK here while also indulging his first love  the visual effects and style.Overall this is an enjoyable summer blockbuster and stands out in the crowd of average sequels and trashy attempts at blockbusters that have crawled in and out of our cinemas this year. Yes, it's full of the usual tough cop genre clichés and the sci-fi element doesn't get as interesting or morally complex as it should have done but this is an action movie and I found it to do all the things I needed to do to entertain me  set pieces, interesting story, fun, effects that are actually special and a film that builds to a satisfying (if overblown) conclusion. In the cold light of day it is an imperfect film but it is easily one of the better blockbusters of 2004.",Null,143,213,23 August 2004
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Creative, funny, engaging, and exciting
","There was a lot of hype about this film, which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it 'got' the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.Overall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms.",Null,0,0,22 September 2019
American Beauty," A bit pretentious at times, exaggerated at others but will still touch a nerve with those of us that look at our `stuff' but wonder where our happiness went
","Lester Burnham is stuck in a rut - he is having a midlife crisis, alienated from his wife and daughter, sexually frustrated and longing for a feeling that he had as a young man that responsibility robbed him of as an adult. When he meets his daughter's best friend it kicks off a realisation that his life needs to change, starting with quitting his job and acting less responsible.  Meanwhile the lives of both Carolyn and Jane Burnham begin to change in different ways as they also try to deal with the empty days that they seem to live.When this film came out it jumped almost to the top of the imdb top 250 list - much as many films that make a big audience think or feel something do. Also it gained award after award and was basically held up as a generally great film.  I saw it at the time and was very impressed by it as it touched a nerve in some regards.  Watching it several years later I still am able to take some thinks from it but am more open to the faults that are within it. The actual plot is exaggerated in terms of it not fitting in with the average audience member's experience.  However it's wide wings will mean that it will speak to a large section of it's audience.The points it has to say are very broad but are delivered in a reasonable manner - i.e. not overly veiled but not rammed down our throats.  I like to think I am a few years off a midlife crisis but I can see my life in Lester's feelings, as many of us can - hence the film's success.  This is not to say that the whole plot is perfect for it is not.  The film is slightly arty and, sadly, a bit pretentious.  I almost dare not say it as I know many audience members were very touched by the `bag scene', but I did think to myself that the film must be very good to be able to carry off a scene that is so full of cheese and pretension!  This happens at several points throughout the film in different ways and does take away from the film somewhat.  Likewise the film's lapse into `whodunit' towards the end doesn't really work either.  Happily the central plot and the classy delivery from director Mendes makes for a great film.The cast greatly helps and were appropriately rewarded for their work. Spacey may have been in the process of losing his edge by this point in his career (hopefully he'll get back to his best, but he hasn't at the time of writing).  Here he is great and his semi-comic delivery helps smooth out some of the unlikely edges on his character.  Bening is given a lesser role in terms of not being central to the story but her character is actually more emotionally real than Lester - she has to deal with life like the majority of us whereas Lester flees from it.  Birch is good and underplays well while it is nice to see Suvari in a film that isn't average.  Bentley has the least role of the film as his character is the most abstractly drawn and least realistic.  He is OK in the role but he is limited by what he has to work with.  Janney's role is small and one dimensional but her performance is great - it is hard to believe that this is the same woman that plays the super confident and talkative CJ in West Wing!  Cooper is as good as ever and small roles are well done by Gallagher, Bakula and Robards.Overall this is a very good film but I find it hard to accept that it has been consistently as high up the critics (amateur and professional) lists as it has been.  It has a good plot that has broad enough characters so that most viewers will find something to relate to, but this stretch also opens it up to problems that serve to weaken the film somewhat.  That said, this is still a film that is thoughtful, artistic, character driven and moving - and when a big Hollywood film manages to do that then it is a cause for praise, not complaint.",Null,11,25,10 April 2004
BASEketball," Disappointingly lame comedy
","When a sport played in front of their garage is picked up as a national sport Coup and Doug become professional sportsmen in a league where professionals mix with less professional.  When the owners of the Beers dies he leaves the team to Coup if he can win the next season.  TV executive wishes to gain control of the team and make the sport fully professional and more profitable and begins to work to cause the team to lose. This effort from the creators of South Park is a pretty hit and miss affair - unfortunately it's mostly misses.  I find South Park very funny and I thought the movie they did was great, similarly I love the Airplane and Naked Gun style of humour that David Zucker does so well.  So I assumed that I would easily like this.  The plot is unimportant in all these type of things - here it something about keeping ownership of a team in a meaningless sport - but it's the jokes that matter. Unfortunately many fall flat.  There are some good lines and some funny background jokes but the majority of it isn't very funny.  It's a shame because the funny bits are very good but I forgot them because the majority of the jokes are lame.  The best stuff are the background stuff like the team names (The Miami Dealers!) and a lot of the stuff that goes on in away from the plot such as commentators' comments etc.The performances are pretty pointless in these spoofs, but Parker and Stone do alright with mostly poor material.  Ernest Bourgine doesn't do himself any favours and looks a bit stupid (I'm too sexy!) but some of the other cameos are good.  Robert Vaughn has a great role and gets plenty of funny jokes, in fact he appears to have got the best role of the film.  Robert Stack, so great as Kramer in Airplane, again has several good scenes.  The rest of the cast is filled out by beautiful women, Yasmin Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy etc, who don't really have anything to do.  Unfortunately at times the most interesting performances are those of the beautiful, scantily dressed cheerleaders at the baseketball matches! Overall a disappointment which is a shame given the comedy talents involved. Most jokes are mediocre with only a hatful of real belly laughs.  Worth watching - but even South Park and Airplane fans will be disappointed with this.",Null,2,10,4 January 2002
Over the Hedge," Par for the genre course  OK for kids but only a handful of laughs for adults
","When raccoon RJ tries to steal the junk food stash of hibernating bear Vincent, he is given a week to replace it or become the food himself. RJ seeks out a new human community that has just been built. Meanwhile, a community of animals awaken from hibernation to find themselves cut off from the wilderness and separated from the neighbours by only a hedge. Despite the reservations of Verne's tale, the community of animals is convinced by RJ that they can gather lots of food from the humans rather than the wild. However RJ's impatience to rebuilt the stock of food for himself sees the neighbours taking action against the invading animals.When people rent a comedy or an action movie, they don't expect it to be good simply because of the genre it is in. They might expect it to be their cup of tea because generally they enjoy comedy or action movies but simply being in the genre is no proof that it is any good. Although it is not really a genre per se, the films that fit into the world of Pixar animation with plenty for kids and adults with famous voices have historically been seen as well worth checking out. However, although the standard may have been set high when Pixar first hit, their have been some weak examples  indeed some of them from Pixar themselves. So it is with Over the Hedge, which has its moments but does seem to have assumed that if it just does what everyone else is doing then it will make money.Which I'm sure it did  however this is different from the film being a good example of the genre. The plot is the usual morality tale with animals in it, which serves its purpose and allows for a 'message' to be taught. This I had no problem with but it was the fact that the script was not smart enough or funny enough. As opposed to being full of golden one-liners and references, the script is actually mostly dialogue and the film relies heavily on physical comedy. I'm sure this is fine for kids but as an adult I found myself not laughing that often. It was still amusing though and I did have a handful or belly laughs  perhaps not enough to make it stand out but certainly enough to make it distracting fun for the 80 short minutes it lasted.Following the conventions of the genre, Kirkpatrick directs with a steady hand and the film mostly looks good but he doesn't do a great deal that marks him out as special. It doesn't help that he is served with a terrible collection of songs that I personally found quite painful at times. The film also does the usual thing of loading the cast with famous voices but it seems to forget that really the casting should have focused on getting the right voice  not just the big name. This applies to a few but none more than Lavigne, who offers little more than her name. Willis is not offered much material but his voice is solid and his presence good. Shandling is good but does occasionally sound like he knows the material is a bit below him. Sykes is obvious and her character seems to be little more than her race. Carell is everyone's favourite, partly down to his delivery but mostly down to his material as he is easily the best character in the film. Nolte was well cast for his character, Church doesn't do much but Levy and Djalili are well used and give good performances. It was disappointing that the script did not make more references to Shatner as an actor  he was OK but the only time I was amused was his overacted 'death' scene.Overall then, an amusing if not totally successful entry in a genre that has seen standards drop of late. It has its moments, looks good, has plenty of famous voices and has a handful of good laughs but it is not as smart or funny as it would like to think it is. At times I did get the impression that it hoped that simply by aping others it would somehow just work. Good for kids and with the odd laugh for adults, it is amusing entertainment but just don't expect it to be anything other than par for the course.",Null,1,1,4 September 2007
Wanted," Silly nonsense that just about suffices as post-pub action fodder but nothing more than that
","Wesley Gibson is a simple office worker tired with his life and past the point of hoping for more. Before you can say 'hang on didn't The Matrix do this but better?' Gibson is approached by a woman claiming he is the son of a famed killer with near-supernatural abilities and that he has them too. It takes a few gun battles to make him believe the story, but Gibson is soon under the wing of the Fraternity, a group of super-assassins under the leadership of the shadowy Sloan, who kill based on the thread patterns sown by a magic loom (no, really). Gibson begins training for his ultimate task  taking down the man who killed his father all those years ago.Wanted was a Friday night rental and I cannot imagine it would work any other time than that. The plot is a mix between The Matrix and a warm turd (guess which side the loom is from) and it just about pulls a basic frame for lots of action, running, shouting, and gun pornography. There is not a point to expecting anything more than this because it offers nothing more, except maybe unintentional laughs at the sheer nonsense of the plot. This was not a particular problem for me in terms of words on paper but the delivery seemed to suggest that I should take it at least a little bit seriously and is a bit po-faced  to the detriment of the film, which really needed to be played for sheer fun.Because the action is reliant on the plot and characters to draw us in, it cannot save the film but it certainly provides a distraction. The excessive abilities of these humans is another turn off in regards 'getting into it' but on the flipside it does provide some action sequences that are so outrageous that it is hard not to enjoy them for the sheer spectacle. Director Bekmambetov is probably a reasonable choice if this is the only aim as he also made that superficial vampire success the other year, but he cannot draw anything from the talented cast nor draw the audience in. I feel a little sorry for James McAvoy as he has solid roles under his belt and was due his 'big action film' role, however this shows that when opportunity does knock you should probably answer with the door on the chain just in case. He has a fairly thankless role but throws himself into it well enough within the context of the film. Morgan Freeman dials in his performance but yet it still fits. Jolie has clearly just been told to pout and look sexy as much as possible because that is all she does. Personally I found her skinny frame to be alarmingly unsexy and wondered who she is surrounding herself with that nobody has taken her to side about how bad she looks in this film. The support cast offer little but their familiar faces and are a weird bunch of Stamp, Common, Warren and others.Wanted is a fairly basic film then but one that has enough money thrown at the action to just about make it appeal to the teenage boy in us all. However it is impossible to ignore just how very daft it all is and how none of it really gets the heart going. Instantly forgettable stuff but if you're looking for something noisy and totally undemanding then this would fit that bill.",Null,4,8,11 September 2008
Warrior," OK sports movie but overlong and doesn't deliver the story as it thinks it does (SPOILERS)
","I came to watch Warrior knowing that the general opinion was that it was a superior sports movie but also that a lot of people seemed to have been taken by surprise by how good it was, both critics and audience. So, imagine my surprise to find that in my opinion we had a potentially really good sports movie that is rather hampered by a flawed attempt to be more than just two men in a cage hitting each other. The plot is fairly obvious but this is part of it being a genre film; two brothers from a broken home, long since separated from each other and also their now-sober father. Trained as fighters as children, the two are now a high-school teacher who turns back to MMA to earn enough to save his home from the bank, while the other is haunted by his past in the Marines.If you do not already know that the two will meet in the final then I salute you and your lack of cynicism, but the majority of viewers will know this and this will only add to the sense of anticipation. In regards the fight scenes, they are brutal and engaging. I'm really not a fan of this activity and any attempts to watch it have left me cold, but this is shot really well, taking you right into the action with a sense of urgency and a sound design where you feel every impact. This is the reason that the second half of the film really gets going. Unfortunately when it is not focused on these conflicts, the film doesn't have the same impact. I can see the potential and i can understand that some loved the rather slow and mostly unspoken relationship backstory, but for me it was almost too slow, too unspoken and with too little in there to justify the approach. At times it gets close to being pretentious as it grinds out the clichés in an overly worthy fashion and doesn't provide the heart of the story despite having so much time to do so. Speaking of which, the film is painfully overlong and could easily have lost a good 20 minutes and been the better for it.In terms of performances, the film is generally good. Hardy shows us what a good Bane he could be and he is impressive in his body and performance; I would have liked to have seen him have more to work with than he does, but he does a lot with looks and presence. Edgerton has more of a human face and as a result it is him that the viewer feels more for; he is good here, both in the ring and out of it despite most of his material being a cliché. Nolte is Oscar-nominated here and I will say I am surprised. He has good presence and he does seem to get his character and deliver a lot of pain, but I didn't think the film valued him as much as it could have done, as he does rather seem secondary to most of it. The three men do help make the film better than it could have been, but they all deserved more than the script gave them.Warrior seems to be loved by the majority of viewers but for me it left me rather cold. The fights in the second half ramp up the drama and it does deliver as a solidly entertaining sports film, but the rest of it simply doesn't work as well as it should have done. The cast deserved better and, although they do a lot with their performances, the film moves too slowly and with too little impact any time the focus is on character and family. There is a lot of beef in this film for sure, but I was disappointed to find that there wasn't anywhere near enough meat.",Null,2,5,4 March 2012
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Builds on the strengths of the first film to be funny and fresh
","The New York zoo animals have decided to conclude their time on the island and return to their home in Central Park. Along with King Julien and a few others they board a retro-fitted plane designed and built by the penguins and set off. Things are going great for a while but it is not long before they run out of fuel and drop like a stone onto a reserve in Africa. To his amazement Alex finds he has returned to his birth home and has been united with his parents while the other animals all learn what it is to be part of a tribe and outside of the confines of the zoo community however it is not long before the friends find themselves being separated.The second Madagascar film didn't get great reviews off the critics, with it generally being met with a collective shrug with nobody having anything specifically bad to say or specifically good and, as a result I figured this would be fine on DVD rather than the cinema. I watched it last night and was pleasantly surprised to find that the film was an improvement on the first one  mainly because of lessons learnt from the first ones. I recall the first film as being significantly stronger in the side characters than in the main story and main characters and the same is true again here. The four New Yorkers are OK and they do drive the narrative which is better this time round even if it is a bit prone to moralising. One thing I did find a bit odd was a thread about how Alex could not tell Marty apart from all the different zebras  OK there was a bit of Rock joking about 'we all look the same' but having it be an actual thread rather than an aside meant it did clunk around there without being refuted that much  a weird racial thing to have in the film but I digress.The main step up in quality though has come with reducing how much running time this takes up and increasing that given to the 'lesser' characters. King Julien is a scream throughout and is a welcome return and of course the monkeys and penguins easily deliver good laughs without ever being asked to carry the narrative. The humans in the jungle are a bit of a necessary evil in regards the story but don't deliver much in the way of comedy  to me the elderly women is no more than n one-off visual gag, not a character. Mostly though the film is very funny with lots of good laughs but not too many rooted in pop culture references so that it will date quickly in the way other films have  and what references it makes tend to be more 'timeless' ones such as the great Twilight Zone gag. The voices are impressive in the amount of names involved. Stiller, Rock, Smith and Schwimmer all do good turns, fitting their characters pretty well but the lion's share of the gags continue to fall to Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Miller and a few others. The additions of Mac and Baldwin work well too.Madagascar 2 is not a massively new creation that deserves special mention ahead of anything else good in the genre but it is certainly not a shrug of a film by any means. It builds on the strengths of the first film (the other characters) and makes a stronger and funnier sequel that is still not a brilliant thing but is definitely funny and fast paced enough to satisfy both adults and children.",Null,3,6,8 February 2009
Salt," Messy plot but moves slickly enough to stop you worrying too much till after you have watched it
","Evelyn Salt is an agent for the US government – highly trained and highly effective. However, when a Russian defector brings news of children raised in Russia as Americans and placed into the US as sleeper agents in all manner of powerful positions, Salt is one of those named. Knowing she is innocent, Salt's first thought is to ensure her husband is safe and, unable to do so from the custody of her employers, flees – essentially admitting her guilt in the eyes of Agent Peabody, even if her boss Ted Winter is adamant of her innocence.The plot of Salt appears to be the standard stuff of a highly trained special agent out on their own trying to clear their name while being hunted by their own people. To its credit it is a bit more twisty and turny than that and it does make it more engaging that if it had just been played straight out. This is not the same as me saying it all works though, because to be honest if you sit down and look at it in the cold light of day there is a lot in the plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In particular there are narrative-conveniences that are done for the sake of it even if they are incredibly unlikely. The thing is though, the film carries them and, while you may easily pick holes in it, the chances are that the majority of viewers will be doing this after the film rather than during it.It is not just the specific action sequences that do it but rather the overall tone and pace of the film. It is slickly made and delivered over 90 minutes so that there is no time for the viewer to ruminate on specifics – instead we are whisked to the next twist or next moment. Living in the moment is the action/thriller film's friend and it works well in Salt, making it fun and quite urgent while you are watching it. Of course a lot of it doesn't make sense and normally I would be the first to call nonsense on such a film, but somehow Salt makes it work.Having a banner star is essential and, although I'm not a fan of Jolie, she does have a screen presence (quite how considering how stick thin she is, but she does it). She doesn't quite deliver on the potential of her character here as she only lets a humanity come through now and again, opting instead to mostly go with 'sexy indestructible spy', which is less effective and has been done to death for all but the most libido-led teenage boys. Schreiber and Ejiofor are both strong in support and add a weight to the film that it definitely benefits from. The rest of the cast are solid enough but the presence of Andre Braugher is a mystery to me – such a good actor and well-known face but yet here he is on screen for a few seconds and barely two sentences to say.Salt is not a brilliant film by any means and the sequel-friendly ending didn't have me excited to see the character more, but yet I enjoyed the film while I watched it. The slick delivery and strong pace help cover up the plot holes and convenient narrative devices and generally it is fun. Best enjoyed in a genre friendly setting such as the summer blockbuster season or as a Friday night DVD though as it is probably not strong enough to play well away from home turf.",Null,7,13,7 September 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Has its moments but it is not funny enough to support the running time and ends up being 'OK' but not much more than that
","As an grown man, Dewey Cox waits behind the scenes to go onto stage for the performance of his life. While the introductions are being done, he finds a suitably dimly light corner, strikes a 'troubled' pose and starts to reminisce about the life that he has lived that has brought him to this point. Fortunately for Cox the introductions are long as he needs time to start with his childhood and go through deaths, love, losses, betrayal, drugs, light entertainment, sex, more drugs, daddy issues and more drugs before he can perform with a clear head.I rented this film without actually realising that it was basically a spoof on Walk the Line, which I fortunately had seen some months previously. Without knowing this or having seen that film, I would suggest that you are probably going to miss a lot of the gags since some of them are funny mainly because of their similarity to the 'straight' film. It shouldn't be a massive problem though because it still does work as a comedy based on the rock biopic genre and as such is general enough to not require a great deal of knowledge. No, the bigger problem that most viewers are going to have with it is that it is just not as funny as it should be.The length is part of the problem as it pushes the two-hour mark. Fine if the film has enough to make that work but this just doesn't. The plot is just a frame for the comedy, so that will not help engage; all that will really do it is to keep the viewer laughing as the film goes along. And there are laughs  some good ones and plenty that made me chuckle  but they are spread thin and are often the type that are amusing scenes rather than killer lines or sight gags. One is not better than the other but really this type of film needs both, the former keeping a firm bed of amusement to engage while the latter type delivers regular laugh-out-loud moments. Perhaps if it had been shorter then this wouldn't matter but this plus the running time leaves it baggy.The cast try their best though and it was nice to see Reilly leading a film and doing a good job of it. The rest of the cast are second fiddle behind him but I did think that, laugh-wise, there were good turns from most of the main actors while cameos from Duffy, Ghostface and a few others added some laughs. That said though, Walk Hard is not a brilliant comedy so much as it is a reasonable one. It is rarely as funny or as inspired as it needs to be and the comparatively long running time makes this stand out all the more, leaving a film that is OK but never consistently more than that.",Null,2,4,8 January 2009
Duck Soup," A consistent delight
","For years Mrs Teasdale has been bankrolling the Government of the small country Freedonia. However when they ask for another $20 million from her she insists that she'll only give it over on the condition that the current leader step aside for the influential statesman Rufus T Firefly. And so it is that the people of this happy country cry out in gladness for their new leader even though he does nothing to endear himself to his Government. As he does just what he pleases, the neighbouring country of Sylvania sends in Pinky and Chicolini as spies to try and find out something about Firefly. However with such people is positions of power, anything could happen.Easily the best of the Marx Brothers' films, Duck Soup has the music and comedy that we expect from them but it also serves as a great satire on war, politics, religion, the justice system and many other targets from polite civilisation. The plot is thin if you are coming to it looking for a well rounded story with a start, middle and end but it does have these themes running through it and it means that it is never tiresome or repetitive. Of course at its heart the real reason we are all here is the great material that the brothers serve up. My favourite and most dominate aspect of the film is Groucho's material. He is so sharp and quick that it is easy to have one laugh after another drawn out of you. The musical numbers are stronger here than in other films  here they are funny and part of the narrative as opposed to other films where you get the feeling that they are playing instruments for the sake of it.Groucho is great value and does well throughout. He is supported well by Chico although I always found Harpo to be quite limited. Zeppo makes an appearance as one of the dull brothers and doesn't make much of an impression. Dumont is a good sport and good fun in a role that mostly involves coping with Groucho's barbs. The rest of the cast mainly support the manic humour with Calhern being another example of someone just soaking it up as a good straightman.This is a great film. Fans of the Marx brothers will love it as it is a sheer melody of irreverence, wit, intelligence and invention from start to finish. Everything works and it is a consistent delight.",Null,5,11,4 August 2006
Apocalypse Now," Redux: still brilliant - but now with new strengths and weaknesses
","In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy. Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad. Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny. However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.That Redux was going to be anything less than brilliant was never in doubt: it was never going to be so different from the original that it would destroy or significantly damage the reputation or impact that the film has. What was in question to my mind was whether or not Coppola should have just left well enough alone.  I have seen the documentary about the making of the original film, wherein Coppola derides many of his scenes and decides to cut them out of his movie even as he finishes shooting them - the plantation scene being one of the key ones that he felt just didn't work.  It was for this reason that I was interested to see what the additions and rejigging of scenes had done to the film.The strengths of Redux is that Apocalypse Now was never about the straight story, it was more about the journey Willard undertakes rather than a build up to a traditional conclusion - while the ending is big, it is no more or less important that anything that has gone before it.  So for that reason it is a good thing that, simply put, there is now more of the journey to be enjoyed!  `49 minutes of new material' my dvd cover screams at me; combine this with the movement of scenes and certainly it does have the feel of a different (albeit familiar) film rather than just a bit of spit and polish with some new CGI effects (yes ET, I'm looking at you).  However this increased material also brings with it the problems that not all the material compliments the film in terms of total quality.None of the added scenes or sequential movements are bad or even average, they are all interesting, but some just don't seem to really fit.  The plantation scene has some great dialogue (that strikes a real chord so recently post-Iraq) and it makes it's points but it just didn't seem to fit. I can see what Coppola was trying to do and, if you watch Hearts Of Darkness, you can see that it frustrates him that it doesn't work, but he got it right first time, it doesn't fit despite it's standalone merits. Likewise the playboy bunny scene intrigued me as I tried to get more from the bunny's semi-speech about being made to do things and the theme of objectification, but again it didn't totally work and seemed out of place.Despite these two major scenes not totally fitting, they are still interesting and, if you came for the journey, then that is what matters and they present themselves as a flawed part of that journey - but a part of that journey nonetheless.  Some of the smaller additions actually contribute a lot more to the film.  Little moments in the boat show Willard to be more relaxed as a man than the original did - and this greatly benefits my understanding and appreciation of his character.  How he interacts with the rest of the crew is also improved.  Other minor additions to existing scenes serve to enhance them, but improvement in some areas is difficult when it comes to this film.I won't go into details on cast, performances and the themes of the film as I have already done that in my other review.  Suffice to say that, if you loved Apocalypse Now then Redux will likely both enhance your enjoyment and slightly irritate you at the same time.  The film easily stands up to the longer running time - as another user said, I could easily give the five hour version a stab (well, maybe once!) as the journey is the all.  The additions may not be without flaw, but then that's why they were higher on the editing hierarchy than the rest of the stuff!  However they add interest and minutes to the journey - both of which are good things.Overall, it is very difficult to take `one of the best films ever madeT ' and make it better - and Coppola hasn't done that here, but he hasn't damaged it either.  It isn't a brand new film and it doesn't mess around with the original so much that it could be called a different film - so I won't compare the two as to which is `better'.  Suffice to say that, while I don't totally agree that you `can't have too much of a good thing', certainly an extra 49 minutes is gratefully received where it doesn't damage or cheapen but only seeks to enhance and support.",Null,31,38,27 March 2004
Apocalypse Now," Great interpretation of a good book to deliver points on the nature of war
","In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz.  Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy.  Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad.  Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny.  However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.It is a film everyone knows, and a `making of' story that is familiar to everyone on some level.  The problems with the military, with destroyed sets right down to Keitel walking off set to be replaced by Martin Sheen who then had a near complete breakdown during filming.  However the story itself is what keeps this so popular.  The original book is set in Victorian times and is similar only in the concept of travelling up a river and confronting something dark and changed in the shape of Kurtz.  The modern day spin on it makes it even more interesting as it looks at the madness that comes with power within war.The journey itself is at times comic and at other times brutal.  The overall feeling is one of soldiers not knowing why they are fighting or who they are fighting.  The feeling of confusion and fear is inherent in the film and is very well delivered.  Willard's journey never fails to grip and is interesting on whatever level you watch it  whether it be for the famous set pieces or for the underlying themes.The performances are excellent.  Sheen has never been better and now seems so distant from his character that he is a different person.  While some of the emotion on screen was real, he does a great job as our guide through the journey.  The best performance comes from a surprising source Brando. Despite the fact that he was difficult, horribly over weight and hadn't learnt his lines, his eerie performance is still haunting.  His mumbling and reasoning in the shadows show that he may be touched by madness but, in the context of war, he is also touched by cold logical reasoning.  Likewise Dennis Hopper fits in well despite his stoned demeanour.  The support cast include some names as Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Forrest and a young Larry Fishburne.Overall this will remain a classic on many levels.  The film itself is great and full of spectacle, the story of the making itself is interesting, the performances are wonderful despite everything and the fact that it has other themes makes it even better.  As an war movie it is great simply because it isn't about the war it IS war  in the words of Coppola `it isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam, it's how the Americans were in Vietnam.  We were in the jungle, we had too much money, too much equipment and, little by little, we went insane'.  Classic film on so many levels.",Null,9,13,1 July 2002
The Battle of Algiers," A balanced and fascinating historical piece with lessons that extend far beyond Algiers
","Sections of Algeria are seeking independence from France, but there is no political will for them to e rewarded it and, if anything, the French are unwilling to give it and must demonstrate their strength by holding onto it. The formation of the FLN sees the struggle for independence take on a violent edge as terrorists (or freedom fighters) strike quickly and unseen, killing policemen across the city. As the situation spirals out of control the French bring in the Foreign Legion to take over, under the leadership of famed soldier Mathieu.One of the few films where I actually care about its IMDb rating, this is a strong film that surprised me by how balanced and even-handed it was. I don't know the whole history of the situation (outside of what this film tells me) so I'm not really set up to say how accurate it is but it is convincingly realistic and the apparent lack of bias in the telling makes it easier to believe that the film has not been made with a significant political agenda for one side or the other in play. Filmed in a style that put me in mind of the French New Wave films, it looks very natural and uses real locations to very good effect. The violence shown is shocking because I never expected such scenes  perhaps they are not graphic in the way that Hollywood does violence to entertain us, but in a 'realistic' documentary-style film it is hard not to be affected by the scenes of torture.By focusing on the guerrilla warfare of the FLN and the French's military efforts to defeat it, the film continues to resonate today  which is why it was allegedly shown in the Pentagon and also why it continues to have a high rating on this site. Historians warn about learning the lessons from history and the concept here of the French defeating 'terrorists' by using methods that completely lose the battle of ideas and the famous 'hearts and minds'. It makes such points by simply allowing them to make themselves  ie the history is replayed warts and all and the lessons are clear (but sadly difficult to learn it seems).Overall then an impacting story that is very well told. Using a documentary style adds to the realism but it is the even-handed retelling and refusal to take sides that makes the film so strong and so relevant. With events in the world indicating that we haven't learnt much from even our recent history, this is definitely worth seeking out.",Null,4,8,11 December 2006
The Patriot," 10% historical drama + 30% flag waving sentimentalism + 60% Mad Max = 100% twaddle
","Although the British are engaged in war in neighbouring areas, Benjamin Martin sees no reason to get involved as he is a peaceful man now, despite his infamous military background. However when the British burn his home and heartlessly kill one of his young sons, Martin knows he must take a stand and enters the conflict. With great personal sacrifice he joins the bloody conflict for freedom and honour and the love of his country.In his episode of The Simpsons, Mel Gibson starred in a remake of Mr Smith Goes to Washington except Homer helped him to change it into a film that was closer to Lethal Weapon than the James Stewart original. That was a joke, but having just watched Mel Gibson turn the American Civil War into a sort of revenge action movie I considered that perhaps Homer had a hand in this one too and that the joke was on us for spending three hours watching it. It starts out with a bit of moral chat about the importance of peace etc but one dead son later and Benjamin Martin has become a one-man war machine, wiping out 20 British soldiers in a blink of an eye. It is the start of a morally simplistic film that offers little for those looking for a historical piece. In fairness the film never actually aims to be anything other than a modern action movie in a historical setting but having low ambitious doesn't mean it can't be criticised for being crap  because that is just what it is.So we have the pantomime villains of the English killing women and children while the good wholesome American people (most of whom employ blacks to pick cotton rather than use slaves) try to do the right thing but are drawn into a bloody fight for freedom and justice. It is as simplistic as it sounds and every time Emmerich fears that his audience are losing touch with who the bad guys are, he'll have them burn kill a load of women with gleeful glints in their eyes. It gets tiresome very quickly and the fact that it is three hours long (give or take  I'd prefer to take) just makes it worse. Visually it looks as good as you would expect a big budget production to do but substance-wise it is just nonsense, with overblown (if impressive) battle sequences which laughably include lots of John Woo style use of guns, slow-mo and catching weapons in mid-air before using them. The bits in between the action are no better as they are merely twists of an emotional knife that the writer must have hoped would make us overlook how simplified everything is; I was waiting for the scene where Col Tavington drowned kittens in a sack to demonstrate how evil he was. No, this is not a film to come to for debate because as far as Rodat is concerned, that is all done and dusted in the early stages and then completely dismissed as nonsense by the next 160 minutes of film. I'm not going to even get into the historical liberties taken because even ignoring them this is still a terrible load of rubbish.Once the film gets going, Mel Gibson only does a couple of things: he is either cocky (like Riggs), brave (like Braveheart) or full of indignation and swelling pride in his country. He flicks between these like someone was turning a switch in his back; he is never consistent and he is never a real person  in fact he is never anyone other than Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger gives a simplistic performance but with no material to work with, what could he do? I don't know why Richardson bothered to show up although I can appreciate that Karyo and Wilkinson have mortgages to pay just like the rest of us. I don't give the same excuse to Cooper because he always struck me as an intelligent actor who makes good decisions  he is really too good to be earning his money from this. The support all do what they are told but I don't want to be too hard on the majority of the cast simply because the material is not there and nobody can do good work with characters that would seem underdeveloped on children's television.Overall this is a good looking and noisy action movie and as such it might just please audiences that like lots of things blowing up and Americans being the good guys. However for the majority of viewers the simplistic material, stomach-churning flag-waving, emotional exploitation and dumb action movie clichés. It is nonsense from start to finish in my opinion and it is not worth 90 minutes, far less 170.",Null,61,131,19 March 2006
Edward Scissorhands," Visually wonderful but emotionally a little hollow
","On her rounds in suburbia, Avon lady Peg Boggs spots the old castle at the end of the street that she has never sold to.  Upon inspection she meets a young man who lives alone in the castle since the death of his creator.  He is a normal boy with the exception that his creator never finished him and in place of hands he has scissors.  Peg brings Edward to live with them. Suburbia greets him with curiosity at first then open arms when Edward's scissors turn out to be a gift when it comes to cutting hedges or hair.  As Edward begins to fall for Peg's daughter Kim, the community slowly begin to revert to fear of the different.Considering recently that he failed to really bring any spark of imagination or wonder to Plant of the Apes, it is worth remembering the impact that directors including Burton had and what they did.  Burton brought his own brand of weirdness to the mainstream cinema and must be given some credit for it's continued place in the cinema.  Of course I do not say he was a trailblazer but his style is quite unique in some respects.  Here he owes a nod of respect to David Lynch as it is he who's suburban picture Burton seems to have modelled his own town, although Burton gives his a much more surreal twist and fairytale naivety.  The community seems to be standalone as opposed to part of a large city and a castle stands at one end of the street  supposedly unnoticed!  The visual design of the film and the unique feel are the main reason to watch this film  it is full of invention as well as well staged cliché.  It's hard to describe but the suburbia-hell design are at once instantly recognisable but also inspired, visually everything has a wonderful `other-worldly' feel to it while still being very real.The plot is pure twisted fairy tale and is really a tale of the odd-one-out teenager if you pare it down to it's bones.  It allows for much in the way of strange humour and strange happenings but it doesn't totally succeed to bring enough emotion out of the plot.  It has the odd moment here and there which is touching but really Edward is too weird for us to totally get behind  I found myself supporting him but still with a edge of not really getting him.  Because so much is made of his appearance and his hands I didn't know much about him and therefore couldn't really feel a lot with him.Depp is good but is partly to blame for keeping Edward as a thin character, although not many other actors would have even tried to do it so fair play. He is amusing and few people can do weird like he does.  Ryder is good as the all-American cheerleader but the real wealth is in the support cast. The support is made up of a list of suburbia stereotypes all exaggerated for humour.  Wiest is strong in her role and I found Arkin to be absolutely hilarious in everything he did!Overall the film looks fantastic and this is enough to justify watching it. It is quite funny and is also weird enough to sustain the interest.  Only where it needs real emotion or a strong heart does the film feel a little hollow and incomplete  just like Edward himself.",Null,4,10,15 March 2003
Silver Linings Playbook," Solid performances but obvious direction and writing rob it of wit, intelligence and depth
","Beyond the nominations for Oscars, I hadn't really heard much about this film so I didn't have any preconceptions to speak of and came into it blind more or less. The film focuses on two characters who are each struggling with mental and/or emotional issues that manifest themselves in acting out violently or sexually. The two get together to work on a dance project which appears to help them deal with their issues to a point, however family pressures, emotional pressure, sports pressure and just generally life doesn't just go away.Given the cast involved and the awards it is up for, the one thing I did expect was for the film to be better than it ultimately turned out to be. It has a certain charm to it but mostly the film disappoints by being so very straightforward and never going really going anywhere dark or deep. Considering the backgrounds (and presents) of the two lead characters, this film is roundly safe and accessible. The mental and emotional struggles of the characters don't seem so bad – just bad enough to justify them as plot devices but never bad enough or real enough to really be an issue that would challenge the viewer or even make them uncomfortable. It isn't that it is comic so much, just that it hasn't got much meat on it. This continues throughout the film before finally it gives up any pretence of being more than just romantic fluff with an ending which does at least represent honesty from the makers – this is the film they were making all along. This is not to say that it is without value – because it is a big film with a lot of talent that is aiming to be accessible entertainment, and it doesn't miss that mark – it is just disappointing that it was aiming for the target generally, not the bullseye.The cast certainly deserve better than they got, although of course they are generally good enough to make the most of what they have. Cooper isn't someone who appeals to me much but he was solid here. Lawrence will probably get the Oscar here and, whether she deserves it or not, she is pretty good – everything asked of her she delivers which is why it is a shame that the film didn't ask for more. De Niro is enjoyable in his turn while there is decent support from others such as Tucker, Mihok, Stiles and a few others – nothing amazing, but solid. Nobody really shines though – but this is down to the material, not them. Russell as writer and director doesn't seem to have any spark, nothing really going on that stood out for me – it is professional, has some charm but mostly it was workmanlike.This is how the whole film turns out in fact; it is good in specific moments but it really plays a nice safe line throughout – ignore the subject matter, it may sound dark and interesting but it is nothing of the sort. A safe film that is consistently accessible and easy on its way to a conclusion that is at least honest about the type of film it is – it will charm many with the ending but the majority of the film doesn't charm or challenge, it just 'is', and I found that to be disappointing.",Null,21,37,23 February 2013
Van Helsing," A noisy effects show lacking tension, excitement or even fun; but then I guess some sections of the audience love that sort of thing
","Under the direction of the church, famed monster hunter Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to protect the remaining Valerious family and assist in their battle against the forces of evil in the country. Once there he discovers that only one member of the family remains alive; luckily for Helsing though it is the gorgeous Anna, who fights monsters with a sexy sneer and a pair of rather tight trousers. Never having fought a vampire before, Helsing soon finds himself fighting the original Dracula, who has a sinister plan involving the use of a werewolves and the late Dr Frankenstein's research into tissue reanimation to achieve his aim  but can he be stopped before it is too late? About six months or more before this film came out in the UK, film magazines were salivating over the cool posters featuring Jackman posing in a long coat against a Gothic, shadowy background; as usual hyping an unseen product. However immune I would like to think I am to hype I was quite taken in by it and starting to look forward to the film but, approaching release and having seen clips from it, I decided it wasn't something I would bother with and decided to put it off until I could get it in my own house without any effort. So it was that a cold evening after a tiring day at work saw me settling down to veg out in front of this film, assuming that it would give my brain no problem at all. I was right in this regard but I had really hoped that the film would not be the noisy effects show without atmosphere or tension that so many critics had claimed but sadly I found out that they were right. The story is less a narrative and more just a collection of set pieces and I never really got into the story and the attempts at subplots (such as Helsings past) just came over as filler rather than stuff I cared about.Another reviewer said that this is clearly a Steven Sommers and that that is no bad thing and, although I agree with the former, he is wrong about the latter because this is at best, an average thing thanks to Sommers. I guess if The Mummy and its sequel are your idea of wonderful films then this will probably do you but for me the action (and story) was just messy and lacking anything of interest or any style that was imaginative; the rule of thumb seems to be when you have a quiet minute in the film then just make some more stuff fall down/go on fire/explode etc. This approach robs the film of atmosphere, genuine tension and genuine excitement at almost every turns. The occasional jump due to things moving suddenly are lazy and easy and don't make up for a real good product with depth. As a cinema fan I did think it was a nice idea to pay homage to the Universal monsters but this was not the way to do it as not of them are really done justice. As with many Sommers summer blockbusters, the effects are always good but never seen to fit in with the real action, by which I mean they always look like, well, effects  again taking away from the excitement of the film because I can get into it when it seems so very artificial. Delivering a good atmosphere would have helped but Sommers is rather one-note and he cannot do this at all.The cast swagger around the best they can, striking poses and jumping around the best they can without really having depth or character to work with. They seem to have been left to work it out for themselves and, as with much of the 'real' stuff in the film, they don't convincingly fit in with the effects. Neither do they convince on the action front, but that is less their fault than the fault of the action that requires them to be thrown around like rag dolls with no consequences. Jackman is a good leading man but he cannot do it without help and here he has no script, director or anything to help him  he is cool and has presence but that is all. Beckinsale has a nice body  and by noticing that I am only doing what the film wanted me to do with her performance, use it as teenage boy fodder; she has no character and I saw close-ups of her bum in tight trousers more often than I saw anything approaching a performance. Wenham provides by-the-numbers comic relief but Roxburgh's Dracula is poor even if his 'brides' are good looking. Of the monsters the only one to make an impression was Frankenstein's monster, who was interesting and not just the roaring effect that the others were.Overall this is noisy, has lots of rather soulless special effects, an uninteresting plot and characters, attractive women and quipping heroes; for many this is all they seem to demand during summer months to pass as entertainment but I couldn't help feel that, amongst all the noise and sweeping sets that someone had forgotten to produce the fun and excitement to go along with it.",Null,4,9,27 March 2005
Monsters vs. Aliens," Fun but also acts as an example of why Dreamworks remains in second place to Pixar in all regards
","When she is stuck by an alien meteorite, summer bride Susan finds herself growing to enormous size and in possession of great strength – neither of which she wanted as the intervention of the US military does rather put a damper on her wedding day. Next thing she knows she is in a secret facility and part of a group of other monsters and mutants which the government keeps under wraps for the greater good. However, when an alien forces comes to Earth searching for the power that transformed Susan, the Government has no choice but to unleash their 'monsters' to fight back.The family animated film 'genre' is pretty crowded at certain times of the years. Since Pixar hit big with films that deliver plenty of adults and children, many have tried to do the same. Dreamworks has probably been one of the more successful and Monsters v Aliens is, for better and worse, a fine example of their output. The adventure story provides plenty of spectacle and, as two people in their 30's watching this without children, we were consistently engaged by it thanks partly to this. What worked mostly better for me was the humour. In the most case the film is pretty funny thanks to the characters and the dialogue – BOB and Dr Cockroach are probably the strongest and they provide plenty of laughs. In contrast I thought the Missing Link was only OK as a character. I was chuckling consistently when the main group were around and the only bits I felt were poorly judged were most of the stuff involving the President (which was a waste of Stephen Colbert – a very smart lampooner of politicians); his keyboard moment didn't work and is quickly followed by an inappropriate joke about soiling himself.Otherwise the voice cast is well used. Witherspoon plays it more or less straight and does a solid job. Rogen and Laurie dominate the laughs and their delivery is great. Arnett is capable of more although his presence along with Tambor makes for an amusing Arrested Development moment and of course Poehler is in there too. The Office's Wilson is fun as the 'baddie' of the piece although Sutherland, Colbert and Rudd are not really particularly good or well used for a variety of reasons.The one thing that this film cannot do though, is to deliver anything beyond the impressive visuals, smart lines and fleeting laughs. It doesn't appear to be trying to have more than this which is fair enough but for my money MvA does remind the viewer of the difference in class (generally) between Pixar and Dreamworks. Pixar films generally seem to be able to do all that this film can, but also deliver so much more – while Dreamworks seems happy with pop culture references in place of depth. That said it is harsh to judge this film against a very high bar of Pixar's best films, but rather it should be met on its own merits. So, yes, while there are things that don't work and also aspects that could have been significantly stronger, the film is generally colourful, funny and engaging for a wide age range. Not a classic by any means but it is still fun.",Null,1,2,7 September 2010
Save the Last Dance," Clichéd, but better than I expected it to be
","When Sara's mother is killed in a car accident she comes to live in a predominately black area in Chicago.  She is befriended by black Chenille and starts to fall for her brother Derek.  Derek teaches her the latest hip-hop dances to help her fit in and together they begin to fall for each other.  However a white girl seeing a clever black man is never going to be popular and the couple must overcome many obstacles to see their dreams and be true to themselves.Did someone say `a black Dirty Dancing?'  Essentially that's what this is, although the story is naturally a bit more urban than that film.  The story is about overcoming to reach your dreams, and it does it quite well  better than I expected.  The love story is nice without being too romanticised. The obstacles are the usual things in an `urban' film  the challenge of mixed race relationships, the temptation to back up your crew instead of getting out etc.  These are quite cliched but are still well done.My main problem came with the strength of black culture in the filmnot every black person (even in a poor area) talks like a gangstaand not everyone says `aiiiirite'  and why did Sara only become accepted when she started to imitate black culture and speak in that way.  It may be realistic, but I felt that Sara should have been allowed to be herself rather than be seen to be assimilated into the hip-hop culture (I don't mean that she shouldn't have got involved with the scene  but did she have to lose part of herself to get there?).  However these are minor side issues that many people won't even think about.The cast are good for MTV teens.  Julia Stiles is cool and Thomas is cute and charming.  The rest of the cast fall into so many black stereotypes  we have gangsta friend, baby mothers galore, useless baby father, jealous bitchy ex-girlfriends etc.  However they are just what you expect so I wasn't too upset.  Fredro Starr was cool as Malakai  even if the character was just one big hood cliché.The soundtrack is hot and the dance scenes are sexy  I wish I could do it! They are much more enjoyable than Dirty Dancing's scenes  although some day this will feel dated too!  Overall I expected another piece of MTV teen tat, but I was pleasantly surprised by a story that, despite being ridden with clichés, is actually very involving and enjoyable.",Null,41,51,21 May 2002
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Solidly told story that builds well and has a real visual impact thanks to direction and cinematography
","I'm probably one of the few people left who came to this film knowing nothing about it whatsoever. I never saw the original films even though I knew I should and, while I was aware that the story was some form of mystery with roots in history, I had more of a 'Dan Brown' type story in my mind and I wasn't sure if I would like it. The opening credits of the US version threw me even more as I wasn't sure what these visceral figures were about or if they were indicative of the film to come. Fortunately after the impact of the credits the film does settle down somewhat and more of a story begins to be told.I had been told that the film was hard to follow and I agreed with Blomkvist when he comments to Vanger that he will struggle with all the names, but the latter was correct when he says soon enough you'll know them. Accordingly the story does flow well throughout the film with the mystery unfolding in a way that takes the viewer with it rather than pulling it out of the blue towards the end, or demanding the audience do too much work. It does help that it is fairly superficial as a story when you boil it down to its basics, but it is presented with a lot going on and a sense of danger and darkness that I enjoyed. It is probably longer than it needs to be but it doesn't ever really drag; there is some time at the end of the film after the mystery has been solved that could have been reigned in, but in fairness they extend the character of Lisbeth so it wasn't time wasted. Similarly although the sexual material between Lisbeth and her new guardian is secondary to the mystery, it is worth it because it informs us on her.Having made Social Network, Fincher seemed to be a good choice for a plot that involves a lot of computer searching and pouring over old records – and indeed he was, to the point that he is the real selling point here. He directs with a real good touch along with Social Network cinematographer Cronenweth. There is little action but the shot framing and the feel of the film gives it a tension and an edge that suits the superficial feel it does have. This isn't a great aspect of the film but it isn't a major problem either since I felt that the delivery of the story does rather cover these weaknesses. I was fortunate to come to the cast without the need to compare with the original (having never seen it) and perhaps I liked them more for this. Mara is good but I never shook off the feeling of her lacking an edge and too often I didn't feel like this character was fully fleshed out in her hands – still good, but that feeling stuck with me. Craig is strong in the lead as he plays quite a bookish type. The support is deep in faces all doing good work – Plummer, Skarsgård, Berkoff, Richardson, Wright and others.Overall Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a solidly engaging mystery that is a little bit too long but mostly unfolds well thanks to strong delivery in the superficial aspects. The cast, the cinematography and the direction create a sense of darkness and danger that is effective at taking the viewer along. I'm not seeing the brilliant film or story that millions other around the world proclaim it as, but I did enjoy it for what it did well.",Null,10,16,19 March 2012
Rocky IV," Film making at it's most basic  but has enjoyable moments
","Rocky is rich and successful, however his friend Apollo Creed feels he has fallen out of the public eye.  When a Russian boxer comes to the US, Creed takes the offer of an exhibition match of goodwill.  During this fight Creed is killed by the might of Ivan Drago.  Rocky decides to travel to Russia and fight Drago in his home country to take revenge.This is where the wheels finally came off the Rocky band wagon.  It was never a really strong series anyway, but this reduces it to nothing more than two fights and some music videos.  Where I and II had soap opera stuff to back up the action, and III had the sub-plot of staying sharp at the top, this has very little.  The story is literally 1  Creed dies, 2  Rocky drives round to flashbacks of the first 3 films before training in Russia and 3  Rocky versus Drago.  Segment 1 is silly  we forget all the `staying sharp at the top' stuff of III and instead have Rocky buffing his cars, buying ridiculous robots for his son etc, and Creed's fight is done with little real drama but lots of `noooooooo' style acting!  Segment 2 is little more than a long series of music videos as flashbacks and training scenes play under rock music.  The fight in segment 3 is OK, but it is very, very far from realism and is maybe a stretch too far.The whole US v's USSR thing is a bit unsavory  the whole thing has a lot of anti-Russian feeling to it, despite Rocky's `message' to the two countries at the end.which to me said `lets all get along (but don't forget that America always wins)'.  Stallone does OK, but he doesn't have any depth that his character had developed in parts I-III.  Shire, Young and Weathers have very little to do, and Lungren is literally a robotic lump of meat for Rocky to overcome.  As for Nielsen  it is very clear from her performance that she only got the role because she was seeing Stallone at the time.Overall this is easily the weakest of the series.  The fight at the end is the only redeeming feature and even that smacks of cheese where other fights had been emotional, well designed to pull your heart strings (even if they were slightly exploitative).",Null,1,6,1 May 2002
In the Name of the Father," Ignores major facts to make its case but is still a good film and an effective piece about injustice
","Gerry Conlon is a small time Belfast thief who gets excluded from Northern Ireland by the IRA for anti-social behaviour and goes to live in England with his old school friend Paul Hill. They are in London when the mainland bombing campaign becomes more intense and they are both picked up for the bombing despite their claims of innocence. After more than week of beatings, abuse and threats, the two men break and sign confessions, longing for the beatings to stop and hoping the courts would see through the lies. However they are found guilty and, along with other relatives, sentenced to time ranging from 14 years to life. As time goes on Gerry and his father campaign for their case to be reopened until, eventually, the lawyer Gareth Pierce takes up the case.I came to this film having not seen it since its release in the early 90's, at which time I was still living in Northern Ireland in a mostly Protestant area. Given the subject matter the film was well received in this area. I decided to rewatch the film last night so that I could review it for this site and, since first seeing it, I have actually more of an insight on the subject matter since I had been held without charge under the same legislation that held the Guildford Four and had been taken to court twice before the charges were entirely dropped. I say this not as some claim to having a more valid opinion than anyone else but simply as a counter to those who will accuse me of being biased on the basis of being a Protestant.While I can see myself that the majority of reviews here for this film are slanted and full of political bias I will attempt to keep my review as free of this as I can (either one way or another).Despite the fact that the film leaves out glaring facts, none of these facts actually affect the film's main thrust  that these men were (for this crime) unjustly accused, tried and convicted. The facts that are ignored are those which would have made the film a bit more complex (eg Hill's membership of the IRA) and I can understand why the makers decided to just make the subject as clean cut as they could and not present the audience with anything that may cause them to be in any doubt about what they are meant to be feeling. I can understand why they did it  but that does not make it right and I would have welcomed a more complex film because those of us from Northern Ireland know that nothing is ever as simply as right/wrong, black/white  but Hollywood is not there to inform but to entertain and hence the facts get lost on the road to a good film. And it is a good film.It is frustrating that people take what it tells them as fact but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made, engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of political beliefs, the idea of a justice system that would do this is interesting and worrying to me, and the film does a good job (albeit it overegged) of letting us see the extent that the police went to to get, if not 'their man', then at least 'a man'. The film does well to deliver characters (although simplified) that are easy to get behind and they helped me get involved in a story that was already pretty involving in its own right. The direction feels professional and injects enough emotion and sense of anger into the film to give it a solid sense of pace without it ever really tipping over into sentimentality or out and out preaching/ranting. Of course the material also helps from a great cast that deliver well and do their bit to keep it edgy and not sentimental.Day-Lewis is a very good actor and he does well here making his Gerry go through the stages of being a cheeky young man, frightened, shell-shocked, defeated, angry and then driven without us ever thinking he is a different character. If anything it is a shame that the film did paint his character so clean because I think Day-Lewis could have easily handled the moral complexities that would have come with that territory. Postlewaite is the real emotional heart of the film in many ways and he does very well with a role that could easily have been cloying and sentimental  but Postlewaite plays it straight till the end. Thompson is all too simple and upright and her performance is little more than a cameo; this is made worse by the fact that the vast majority of English people are biased and corrupt according to the film  again, like leaving facts out, just an attempt by the film to simplify things to make the audiences' emotions clearer and stronger.Overall I like this film but it is not a perfect piece of cinema nor should it be taken as the whole story. The film has dropped facts and directed its presentation to ensure that we, the audience, are in no doubt over what we should be feeling and thinking throughout. This does not change the message of the film or the injustice of the things that happened but it doesn't do justice to the always-complicated situation that is my country. The film as a film is very good  well acted, well paced, well directed and engaging from the early realistic shots of Belfast in the 1970's through to the 'I'm going out the front door' finale that is no less impacting for us knowing it is coming.",Null,174,203,23 August 2004
Being John Malkovich," Just plain weird  but is clever and funny enough to last beyond the novelty value
","A street puppeteer, Craig, is down on his luck and gets a job in an office filing papers.  One day he discovers a small doorway behind one of the cabinets.  He goes in to find himself inside the head of actor John Malkovich  seeing and hearing from inside his head.  In an attempt to impress co-worker Maxine he shows her and they decide to rent the experience out to people.  However Maxine becomes obsessed with Malkovich and Craig tries to stay in Malkovich and work him like a puppet  despite the concerns of his girlfriend Lotte.It's hard to sell this movie without sounding nuts  in 40 years this film will be on the imdb message boards with people trying to work out if they dreamed it or if it was real!  Although the plot is insane it is actually a funny and moving film that is very clever.  The film has a moving desperation about it as each character longs to be someone else  the final shot is heartbreaking.  The plot may well be full of holes but it's so surreal you can't expect it all to make sense  even within it's own logic.Cusack is excellent and this was part of a very good run of films for him. He is delicate and weak, just as he's supposed to be.  Diaz is better than usual and is barely recognisable, Keener steals the show as Maxine giving an OTT sort of performance.  Malkovich himself is really good playing `himself'  he is the brunt of a few gags and he seems to love it.Overall this is worth watching simply because it is so very different to anything else you'll see in the multiplex.  Outside of the novelty value it still manages to be a moving, funny film.",Null,1,4,22 July 2002
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Mostly amusing and funny film that isn't overwhelmed by crudity even if it uses it
","When it was released I never got round to seeing this film and it started to drift away into the mist of my memory until recently when I made an effort to catch it. The reason for this was partly the good things I had heard about it and also the fact that it sort of was the film that started the seemingly endless parade of Judd Apatow films. At times I think this is a good thing but then too often I find his films to be pretty base and lacking the imagination and wit I would like. I thought that perhaps 40 Year Old Virgin would be different because of it being his first hit as director. Of course the title should have given me pause to think on that but I went ahead anyway.What I found was a film that has a bit of what I dislike about Apatow and also a bit of what I do. The plot is a simple one and does a typical soppy narrative that we have seen from him other places  crude laughs but ultimately love comes through. This allows for essentially a series of sketches where Andy attempts to break out of his rut with his 'friends' guiding him on the way. Some of these are pretty funny and some of these are quite weak but mostly they are amusing. The only parts that really fell flat for me were moments of comic racism between a black character and an Asian character  these were not funny and they gave me an odd feeling given they were written by white men. Outside of this the film does have the 'sex comedy' air of geek wish-fulfilment that again Apatow trades in  it does nothing for me this side of his work but I can understand why it does for others.Part of the reason I did enjoy the film is Carell. Unlike Rogen's turns as leading man for Apatow, Carell has more 'likeablity' to him and is also a much better comic. Where Rogen blunders Carell is subtle and clever. Of course we are still talking about a sex comedy so I'm not suggesting he is amazing but he is funny and his performance is bang on. Malco, Rudd and Rogen are good in supporting roles though and all three do this well. Keener works well with Carell to make this thread actually work reasonably well, while Banks is just left with looking hot and being sexy  which she does well enough for this film.40 Year Old Virgin got rave reviews and continues to be looked back on fondly but I'm not seeing it myself. The comedy is crude at times but mostly it is amusing with only one or two failures along the way. It isn't hilarious and it is very much an Apatow film (which means good things and bad things) but is helped by the cast playing to their strengths (eg Carell in the lead, Rogen in support) producing a generally amusing and funny film that dabbles with but is never overwhelmed by crudity or geek wish-fulfilment.",Null,4,8,26 March 2009
Face_Off," Preposterous fun  big, loud and exciting with a master at the helm
","Sean Archer is the head of a special unit set up to hunt down master criminal Caster Troy.  In an airport shootout Archer puts Troy in a coma and captures his brother Pollux.  Archer then discovers that Troy has planted a bomb in LA, yet Pollux refuses to reveal where it is.  With time running out Archer is offered a terrible option - to switch faces with Troy and have surgery to alter his body shape.  After the surgery Archer goes undercover in prison to learn the location of the bomb.  However when in prison, Troy awakes from his coma, forces the doctors to give him Archer's face, kills everyone who knows about the mission and assumes Archer's life.  Trapped in prison, Archer is forced to escape from prison and join with Troy's gang to expose Troy - mayhem ensues.This was Woo's third American film and it was the one he finally struck gold with.  The story is simply daft - don't try to pick holes in it because it's far too easy to do.  What makes the film is that the plot is glossed over by sheer spectacle and great action - you barely have a moment to catch your breath, never mind pick holes in the plot.  The action is fantastic throughout - plenty of trademark slow-mo, diving with two guns etc and all given such style.  In his other US films it all felt like Woo-lite, however here he is allowed to do just what he wants.  OK - the plot may not stand up in repeated viewing, but the action is superb!Travolta and Cage both have great fun playing each other - they mange to swap roles really well.  Travolta has the most fun as he gets to ham it up as Troy for most of the time, but Cage has the better role as he plays the `good guy' for most of it.  Allen and Gershon are both good as the protagonist's partners but have little to do in this man's world.  Really it's all about Cage and Travolta and Woo - nobody else really matters.Overall this may not be a great film due to the weakness of it's plot, but it is still a superb action movie.  Most action movies have poor plots - but not all can provide the huge amount of action and fun that Face/Off does. Fantastic!",Null,22,41,8 February 2002
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The movement sells it and makes it an enjoyable blockbuster
","There is a plot here, involving a secret organization trying to bring down IMF and encourage disruption around the world; probably at a high level it makes a lot of sense but outside of a two-line plot summary on IMDb, it is unlikely you watch a two-hour movie and don't get into the plot a bit more than this. Doing so does mean that things start to wobble quite badly, and the narrative does start to expose itself as essentially being lots of cool words spoken quickly and with lots of spy jargon. Leaps in logic, convenient writing, and generally a lack of anything beyond the superficial are all very much the order of play here.I won't pretend this is not an issue – because it is; but at the same time the film is a summer blockbuster action movie, and to a point you do have to come into that arena knowing what you are accepting as the norm. So the first question really is: does the film succeed on its home turf. In this way the answer is 'yes' because M:I-RN has strong movement whether it being in the many set- pieces it delivers, or in the dialogue sequences which frame them/ This movement is sustained surprisingly well for a film running to this length, and the action sequences are done with the right tone of silliness and spectacle so you can enjoy them and feel less inclined to pick holes in them (which is easy to do).The cast seem to get this too, so they are starry, do the action stuff well, and generally don't worry about much more than whatever moment they are in. Cruise continues to defy logic with his career – and he has a lot of presence throughout this film, often carrying it by sheer will of personality. Ferguson is a good support for him, while Pegg is not too annoying, Renner is solid, Rhames is like an old pair of comfy slippers, and Baldwin adds a sense of class. Harris is an enjoyable but perhaps underused villain.In the end it is an enjoyable film with plenty of action and movement which plays to the strengths of the cast and budget. The weak plot and sense of superficiality of course prevent it being more than a bit of fun, but if it is fine to be this and do it well, then I was fine to enjoy it doing it.",Null,0,1,26 December 2015
Spider-Man," It may be a summer blockbuster but it's actually quite good
","Peter Parker is a dorky kid going through adolescent changes.  However in his case they are changes brought on by a bite from a genetically enhanced spider.  In a difficult lesson Peter learns that his gifts bring him responsibility.  Meanwhile the father of Peter's friend, Norman Osborn is developing a hover platform and strength enhancers for the military.  When he faces losing the contract he takes the treatment himself  creating the Green Goblin, who wrecks havoc on the city  with only Spiderman able to stop him.With some comic adaptations the end results have been disappointing (The Punisher, most of the Batman films etc), however here this is one of recent successes including X-Men.  It may well make changes to the original legend but it's really only things that'll annoy geeks who spend too much time on the internet arguing over whether Iron Man could beat Batman in a fight! The plot has enough to it to distract.  The creation of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin are enjoyable over the first half.  Peter's `experimentations' in his bedroom can be taken any way you want it!  However when the Goblin and Spiderman being to battle it is nice and simple  there's no plot to take over the city, no plan to freeze the world or any silliness like that, it's a simple battle between a good guy and a baddie.In many bits the effects are surprisingly poor  not as bad as I thought they might be, but still bad.  There are many bits where the computer characters don't look real  not just in terms of their movement but more in terms of their looks, in places it doesn't even look as good as the computer game.  Having said that, for most they blend effects and live action together well.  The Goblin's suit doesn't match the comic and it looks a bit like something out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but they use it well although one scene with him does look like something out of Godzilla!The cast are actually what makes the film.  Maguire makes a good Spiderman  he's a goofy looking kid and a good actor.  He doesn't have Spiderman's one-liners but he makes a good character, even when he's behind the mask he manages to bring a certain amount of humanity to the role.  Dafoe ran the risk of losing credibility by being a serious actor who goes for the money and get dressed up in a monster suit for a FX movie!  However he is actually really good  you almost forget how silly it could have been.  There are some really good scenes where he's facing his alter ego and it could have been daft but he carries it off  shows what a good actor he is.  Dunst is good  she really isn't much more than a Louis Lane character but she is good and her character has a good background.  My favourite character is J. Jonah Jameson  he's exactly like he's meant to be and is very funny in a hyper sort of way!  The actor who plays him (J.K. Simmons) is probably best known for his role in Oz, the HBO series.  If you know him in that, then it's weird to see the actor who plays, well, basically the Devil, playing this type of thing  but hats off, he's really good and looks just like the comic book.  The support cast has some famous faces  like Bill Nunn, Ted Rami and a few others, and it's nice to see Rami's favourite actor Bruce Campbell in a small role.Overall I must admit I expected to be let down but, apart from dodgy effects this is a good summer movie.  Plenty of good action and fun but also good performances all round.  The only problem I see is that half this film was filled up with creating the characters  what will part 2 do to fill that time?",Null,4,14,27 June 2002
Jarhead," Avoids the usual clichés and is interesting, amusing and quite different from the norm
","Lost on his way to college Anthony Swofford finds his way into the Marines where, one quick haircut later, he is assigned to be trained as a scout sniper. He quickly learns how to kill silently from thousands of yards from his target, how to camouflage and how to efficiently carry out orders. His experiences in training are not all wholesome and fun but he is easily hooked by the part of the marines that he has joined. When Saddam invades Kuwait the US moves to defend the oil, sorry, the lives of the Kuwaiti people by mobilising the troops. As part of Operation Desert Shield, Swoff and his colleagues are bored out of their minds with the constant drills, routine and total lack of action, however with Saddam refusing to back down, and Operation Desert Storm about to commence, surely it can only be a matter of time.Although I have never read it, I understand that the point of the book Jarhead is that nothing at all happens of any significance and that Swofford's 'war' was eventless and ended without him firing a shot  something that he had trained endlessly to do. So credit to Mendes then he has just about managed to produce a film that engages and moves forward while not losing this central core aspect. The film does this by focusing equally on the nature of the war and on the effect of this modern warfare on the soldiers. Most of the time the latter works well and it was only sections about Swofford's cheating girlfriend and him losing his mind that didn't ring true. Most of the time the film works best by just being a series of scenes where nothing happens  some of them funny, some of them depressing and many of them just 'there'. This worked for me because it held my attention regardless which it was doing. Occasionally it has digs at the modern Iraq war but it does this sparingly, which is just as well because none of them really work that well.Mendes quickly dispenses with the 'war is hell' genre by taking away the impact of both Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter in two scenes that are interesting for very different reasons, and what he is left with is 'war is dull'. This may not sound like something as worthy or as interesting as 'hell' but the film easily shows it is. It shows the men being ratcheted up for killing, only for their training to come to nothing. Several of them say about the Marines giving their lives meaning and direction and it is interesting to watch them being stripped of this point as their time in the desert goes on. It doesn't always convince though and the cracks show where you get the impression that the film is starting to cover ground for the second time but generally I liked how it worked. As director Mendes creates some great scenes that visually stick in the mind while also drawing out performances from his cast that manage to rise above the war movie clichés  in fact only the drill sergeant at the start smacked of being a lesser copy of Full Metal Jacket (although in fairness everything stands in the shadows of Ermey's finest screen moment).The cast mostly work well with the characters, which is important as, with no significant action to speak of, this is where the vast majority of the film takes place. Gyllenhaal is good in the lead character and is able to convince as someone who gets pumped up with his colleagues as well as someone who has a bit of intelligence about him. Foxx is as solid as I have surprisingly come to expect him to be. He gradually takes his character from 'ho-ha' simplicity to a point where his frank discussion with Swofford is convincing and part of a natural softening in his character. Sarsgaard has an interesting character and he brings it out well  with small touches and the breakdown that we know will come to someone eventually. Support is good although nobody really has to do that much in terms of character; minor roles from Cooper and Haysbert were reasonable but not that worthwhile.Overall an impressive war film that is interesting for avoiding the 'war is hell' clichés and producing something different but just as worthy. Swofford's memories are done justice as the film provides just enough structure to prevent it becoming dull but not so much that it forgets the whole point of the source material. Not one of the great war movies but certainly well worth seeing and yet another interesting film from Sam Mendes.",Null,2,4,6 February 2006
Collateral," With patience it is a very effective thriller whose plot problems are covered by a great director and a strong cast
","Max thinks his day is looking up when he gets a beautiful fare who gives him a tip and her business card when she gets out. Resting on his laurels, Max nearly misses his next fare; Vincent, in LA for just one night to close out 5 deals, get signatures and then fly out by 6am and he offers Max a few hundred dollars to taxi him around for the night and then drop him at the airport. Max agrees and takes him to the first stop, only to discover that Vincent's job is actually to kill a list of 5 people and, now that Max has witnessed one killing, Vincent has no choice but to keep him with him.I loved this film; there is no point in trying to hide that fact, but I am not blind to the problems that it has: too many reviewers have either loved it without exception or overly criticised it. The plot has holes  there, I've said it. The plot relies on some actions that don't ring true and other times rely on coincidences or just write things in to move the plot. However this is not a massive problem because it is still very enjoyable and gripping and its other strengths cover these problems. Of course, even with the holes it is still very enjoyable but demands your patience because, although it is tense, it isn't a roller coaster for the vast majority of the time. It has very fast moments but a lot of it is talky and patient  not a problem for me, but I can see why some multiplexers may have had itchy feet waiting for action. However even with this patience, the film is still very tense  helped by some very sudden moments of violence that come out of nowhere and help put the audience on edge. Much was made in Heat of key moments where opposite characters find common ground and in this film it is the opposite but done to similarly interesting effect. Here Max and Vincent are opposites who get under each others' skins over the course of the night; their relationship is very strange and I think the script does well to bring this across even if it is hard to understand at times (part of this is their relationship getting tied up in some of the plot weaknesses).A big part of the plot problems being covered is due to the strong direction from Mann, who can shoot a city like nobody else. As others have said, the fly-overs look great but for me the surprise was to see Mann add digital film to his cannon. This allows him to mix very rough, intimate shots with film to bring the audience in closer. I also noticed that he seemed to do very close angles and frames with 'proper' film as well, all increasing the feel of being 'there' and intimately involved. Of course, on top of this we still had Mann's usual shooting of LA at night  fluorescent lighting, empty streets and so on  nothing new but it is still very effective and great to look at. If it weren't for the very heavy cast involved here then Mann would be the main star of the film but, as it is, his direction is just part of the film pulling together to produce the goods.The cast is impressive and those who have come on the basis of Cruise alone will be surprised to find so many well known faces who are very able. Cruise wants an Oscar and he has done several of the Oscar tricks to get one  his most recent attempt here is to play totally against type. He does it pretty well, making for a convincing cold killer on the surface but still able to reveal an empty core when he is pushed. If he had been allowed to do this more then maybe he would have been more impressive but he isn't and the end result is just a good performance. Of course it doesn't help that Cruise has to play opposite Jamie Foxx delivering one of his most assured performances yet. Based on seeing him in stuff like Booty Call and his own comedy show, I was worried when I saw him due to star in this movie but it turns out that he can act! In fact he dominates the film with a quiet role that runs a gauntlet of emotions while Cruise mostly sits in 'cold killer' mode, meaning that, in most scenes, Foxx is the one we are watching. The support cast is surprisingly deep and the amount of familiar faces makes some moments of violence all the more unexpected. While none of them are really given the time to shine, there are quality turns from Smith, Berg, McGill, Hall, Henley and Ruffalo and it gives the (albeit false) impression of an all-star ensemble; although why Jason Stratham bothered to turn out for the one day of shooting he must have done for the airport scene is beyond me. Overall this is a very effective film. The atmosphere is just right and is helped by the script, the cast and the director  all combining to provide a patient pace that still manages to be very tense and exciting. Mann's direction is great, mixing film with digital to good effect and Cruise is very good playing against type with a good support cast of well-known faces.However the genuine surprise of the film is Jamie Foxx; better known for clichéd ethnic comedy roles, he steps up here and just about steals every scene he is in.",Null,46,63,19 September 2004
Dark City," Darky & moody movie
","John Murdock (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a city full of stillness. He has no memory but it appears he is a serial killer on the run from the police. As he attempts to build back his memory, he finds he has a wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly), but is pursued not only by a police Inspector (William Hurt) but by a group of unworldly shadowy figures with mysterious powers. As the city changes around him he is told by Doctor Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) that he has special powers (tuning) and can defeat 'them'. All the time he longs to return to his happy childhood of Shell Beach.Can't explain too much plot because the strength of the film is that you don't fully understand everything until the very end of the film. The tension and excitement you experience is similar to that of Murdock being pursued and this drives the film. The city is dark and gothic in a 1930's style America - Alex Proyas's direction is so dark that it adds to the mystery and tension of the film.All the performances are strong (Yes - even Connelly and Sutherland) and add to the believability of the whole thing. But really the mystery plot is the key to this dark film. It is a frightening look at humans, memories, what makes us who we are - but it is all tied up in the mysterious workings of the constantly dark city and the shadowy Mr Hand (O'Brien).Don't underestimate this film. Imagine Se7en, The Matrix, Planet of the Apes all twisted into one dark nightmare and you'll get this film. This benefits from being overlooked as each viewer feels they have discovered it and that it's 'theirs'. The plot constantly surprises you and when the truth is eventually revealed in all it's totality it's as powerful as any of the big movie twists of recent decades.  The only bad thing is that the twist is hinted at all the way along and you may work it out - but even when it is revealed the film still goes on for 10 minutes to tidy up all the loose ends, it should have ended on a more dramatic note.Seek this little beauty out and watch it. It's never as good once you know it's secrets but it's a fantastic ride right up till it's natural stunning conclusion.",Null,4,8,6 November 2001
Dunkirk," Tense and engaging, but paper-thin and doesn't really do the scale of reality justice
","I heard many good things about this film, and was looking forward to seeing it - although I had heard mostly things about the technical delivery rather than character, history, etc. From the start this is true, and I might as well get it out and say it - I don't think this film deserves to be as highly rated as it is. However, to say the positives about it; it is impressive in terms of how it is put together - if it is computer generated then I could not see it. Dog fights, huge crowd scenes, explosions, shots inside sinking ships - all of it is immersive and convincing in how it looks and sounds. As almost every scene is one of build-up or delivery, the film manages to have this engaging tenseness which is sustained through a consistent throbbing soundtrack. As a technical package, it is a great piece of construction.More than that though, it is not. I echo the complaints that there are no characters to speak of - only some recognizable faces that we are therefore meant to connect to. This is understandable in such a big film, but it is not like the film did not include soapy character moments (such as the additional boy on the boat heading out), so it is not like it is above them; but when it tries they don't really work. In terms of engagement, it is just the soundtrack and the tension that did it for me - there is nothing to the heart of it. This doesn't just mean 'tearful death scenes' but rather the film didn't deliver the scale of the Dunkirk rescue, the tragedy of the losses etc. By keeping it really focused and limited to a few planes and boats, Nolan is able to keep the film tight, but the price paid is that there is not an understanding of how big this was, nor a sense of pride and history by the end.For what it does well, Dunkirk is worth watching. However it is surprising in how limited a lot of it is in terms of reaching the audience, engaging it with something more than surface, and ultimately moving us with the weight of history; it doesn't really do any of this.",Null,4,5,22 December 2017
Cross of Iron," An effective if superficial anti-war film
","Corporal Rolf Steiner returns from a skirmish on the frontline with his small group of men to find that the broken and dispirited Captain Kiesel has been moved to one side and that he is now under the command of Captain Stransky. Stransky has specifically requested reassignment from France to the Russian front in order that he may have an opportunity to win the Iron Cross before the war is finished. While the Russians get ever closer, Steiner finds his legendary status among the men no help in him saving them and he comes ever more into conflict with Stransky.Opening with a wonderfully smart title sequence this war film never pretends to the audience that this is going to be anything but an anti-war war film. Those in any doubt are put through several pointless and bloody battle sequences where losses are all around. In a way the film is a rather blunt weapon because this message is writ large across every battle scene and I found myself remote from the specific individuals involved and merely left with Peckinpah's overarching interest in the futility of the whole thing. To a certain degree it does of course work and the film is convincing in its depiction of the conditions and the battles are engaging and understandably chaotic. The problem I had with it is that it doesn't have a huge amount beyond this. Early on I assumed that the nature of the characters Steiner and Stransky meant that the film would create this miniature drama within the bigger picture. This element didn't totally work for me though and there was not much in the way of depth to the characters and the story. That said the film does still work on the level it stays at and fans of Peckinpah will be pleased.The cast are mostly good even if I didn't think that they had enough material to work with in their characters. Coburn holds the film with ease and makes for a strong presence while Schell fits his character well; they work well together but individually neither manages to find any depth. Support is roundly good with starry turns from Mason and Warner as well as faces I didn't recognise such as Lowitsch, Glowna and others.Overall then a solid war film that is unmistakably a product of Sam Peckinpah. I would have liked more depth in the characters and the narrative but for what it is it still works well and produces a collection of scenes that have no touch of glorification to be found.",Null,3,6,24 February 2007
The Machinist," Enjoyably dark but lacks development and the conclusion is less than satisfying (mild suggestive spoilers)
","Trevor Reznik is a machinist in a typically greasy and intensive factory. For almost a year he has not slept and the effects on his health are clear for all to see as his weight has fallen off to leave him so thin that he barely exists and so worn looking that he looks steps from death. His tiredness also feeds his paranoia  although it may be that he is rightly paranoid in this case as someone seems to be putting him under pressure over something that he cannot figure out. An accident at work turns his colleagues against him; a mystery man who nobody else knows seems to be stalking him and someone is leaving notes on his fridge door  playing a deadly game of hangman with him.The premise for this film sounds brilliant and many who love the weird thrillers that recent years have seen will be flocking to this hoping for more of the same. In this regard the film will offer great hope to such viewers from the opening minute onwards because it gets the atmosphere spot on from the get-go. It all feels very tense and edgy and we are never in doubt (like Reznik) that something is going on and we want to uncover what it is. This mood is created and supported by great direction from Anderson, who paints the film so dark that it was sometimes hard to see  even the bright outdoor scenes feel like they have had the colour bleached out of them.That the film lacks atmosphere is not a problem that this one ever has to deal with, for it has it in spades. No, the problem begins as I started to want to build on this atmosphere and start to give me more intrigue and development as it builds to a strong ending. Sadly it didn't do this aspect well enough  the film never really tells us anymore or makes much more happen; red herrings along the way are dismissed mere minutes after they are started and they don't provide a wider story. When the answers come, they come all at once at the end  a delivery that isn't helped by the fact that the conclusion is actually not that strong and pretty much does what most of us would have expected even if the detail wasn't guessed. This is a shame because the air of dark mystery was so well done that it really had me interested and the way that it didn't seem to have much to do before the ending acted as a bit of a let down.However, this is not to say that it was terrible because it was far from being that. Although I'm not one for style over substance, here the atmosphere really carries it while the material provides just enough movement to keep me interesting  it was just a bit frustrating that it didn't do the latter better. The atmosphere is only helped by a wasting performance from Bale  an actor whose massive weight loses and gains can only help his reputation generally. He is sickeningly thin, haggard throughout and convincingly paranoid; he is the core of the film and he is a big reason that it works. The support cast features plenty of well-known faces but few of them are well used and seem only to have been cast in order to throw the audience in different directions. Leigh is good, Ironside is a presence and people like Gilliard and Sanchez-Gijon do well; Sharian is a strange menacing presence but does it reasonably well but really the film belongs to Bale and it is hard to imagine anyone managing to steal it from him.Overall this is an enjoyably dark thriller with a wicked atmosphere and mystery within it. Such a shame then that the story doesn't build on this and instead just seem to plod along with the odd red-herring here and there before rushing it all out at once in a plausible but strangely unsatisfying ending. Director and star both do their damnedest to make it work and it is to their credit that it nearly succeeds but it is an underdeveloped script from Kosar that proves itself to be lacking when called upon.",Null,6,13,30 March 2005
The Intouchables," Shamelessly feel-good and sentimental but it works despite how simplistic it all is
","I'm not sure how I came to be watching this film; I had heard of it some time ago and added it to the queue without knowing too much about it other than it was successful in its home market. Supposedly based on a true story, the plot sees a rich quadriplegic employ a rather colorful young man to be his new live-in caretaker. We open the film with a flash-forward but quickly go back to the start of the relationship and quickly are let in on the ground floor regarding how this film will be. Basically Philippe is uptight and locked within himself mentally almost as much as physically, while Driss is carefree and very different from those in Philippe's world. Will the odd-couple become friends and perhaps benefit one another's lives somehow? Well, only time (and the genre) will tell.Of course this is pretty much what happens but you know this from the odd-couple comedy/drama feel that it has from the getgo and it is fairly shameless about doing it. There isn't really a depth to the film but rather a superficial but entertaining pace and plot. It feels cynical for the most part but yet somehow it works if you can get through some cringe-inducing 'heart-warming' moments. A big part of it working is plain and simply the two actors in the lead roles. Neither gives a brilliant performance individually but together they have real chemistry and their banter and shared moments do have a certain genuine and intimate feel that is all down to the delivery. By themselves Cluzet is solid and Sy clowns it up for all he is worth, but yet both are quite charming and likable all the way to the end.Ultimately it is fairly shameless crowd-pleasing fare which airbrushes life into a series of fun set-pieces. It really never touches a real nerve but it is still enjoyable thanks to the warm tone and strong chemistry between the two leads.",Null,3,6,4 December 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Darker and thus better than the first two but still far too baggy and slow
","Its Harry's third year at Hogswarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry and he returns there in a rush having accidentally used magic at home. Forgiven for this by an understanding Ministry, Harry learns that the murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and is supposedly coming to finish his killing spree by murdering Harry. With the cruel and ruthless Dementors circling Hogswarts looking for Black, Harry resides in fear until he learns the truth about Black and longs for to find him and extract his own revenge.Meanwhile many other secrets await exposure within the hallowed walls.I was able to see the first two films of the HP series on video at a friend's house for free, which was fortunate because I certainly hadn't been interested enough to pay to see them in the cinema. However, having seen the first two and enjoying them more than I expected, I decided to go and see this one; before I talk about the film let me rant for a minute. First, how very cynical (but unsurprising) that this film has the longest run of adverts (not even trailers) I've ever seen at the cinema  all during them I could hear children bothering parents that they 'want that'  it just confirms that many studios see these sort of films as big seller rather than films. Secondly, this is a dark film with a plot  if you have a group of children who are all younger than 5 then this may not be the film for them; you know that, so why bring them  just say no! Third, if you do bring them then try to control them  chances are they will not be able to sit still for 2+ hours so bring them a colouring book or a soft toy  don't just let them run up and down the stairs. Anyway, as you may have guessed my viewing experience was made more difficult by children who shouldn't have been there but I stayed calm and remembered it wasn't their fault.The film itself is darker and therefore I enjoyed it more  the change of director has made a great difference in that regard. The plot is also more interesting and is based more on characters and tension that the other films. However this is not to say it is great; because it isn't. No, the film has all the flaws of the earlier films and it is far too baggy and long for one thing. I know fans of the book will cry that it should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in and I wouldn't mind any running time if the film can support it; sadly this film cannot even support two and a half hours and it feels like it is dragging at times. The plot is good but it's delivery could have been tightened up a great deal just by minor snips and the further simplifying of the story  it is meant to be entertainment and, if the long running time takes away from the 'fun' it delivers then it has failed and needs to be trimmed further. The effects are better used here and the darker tone is delivered well in many ways; I enjoyed the shadows and the crueller characters even if some of the aforementioned children clearly didn't want to be in the cinema for much of it!The cast suffer from the same problem as they did in the other two films  being too heavy in names who are mainly underused. Radcliffe is better again and seems to be taking the film with him as he matures. Watson has less to do than in the other two films and I didn't think the film served her well; Grint is comic relief and pretty much that's all he does. Oldman needed the work and has said that in interviews but I still thought he did a good job even if his performance is too much one way then the other (as the plot requires him to be). Thewlis is a temporary addition and it is obvious to even those of us who have never read any of the books that he will be a key part of the film  but his performance is mostly good. The rest of the cast is cluttered and mostly not really used very well, although the impact of this is minimised by them being in a series rather than just being underused in one film. Rickman has almost nothing to do, Gambon is a poor man's Dumbledore, Smith barely says a line, Coltrane just does his usual stuff, Emma Thompson is funny and hams it up a fair bit but Spall is poor and it is annoying to think he is a key character. The rest of the cast features well known faces in (deliberately) small roles including Lenny Henry (doing his usual rubbish accent thing), Dawn French, Paul Whitehouse, Mark Williams (who looks like he'll say 'which was nice' at any moment) and special mention to Ingleby who will be loved by all Spaced fans as the thug who doesn't know where 'it's too orangey for crows' comes from in the funniest episode of that great sitcom!Overall this is an OK film but no more than that. I enjoyed it and felt that the darker tone made it a more interesting film even if it chickens out from going very dark in terms of content and feel. The plot is too rambling and the whole film needed to lose another 20 minutes or so to be a tighter more enjoyable film but I can forgive it that, even if I was bored at times. The cast are mostly wasted again and the film is more a product that an actual film but I was still glad I saw it and will watch the next in the series with the ongoing hope that they will improve. Not great but maybe worth watching once and certainly an improvement over the first two in the series.",Null,7,13,21 June 2004
Ratatouille," Lacks the usual quick-fire one-liners of other Pixar films but is up to the usual quality in every other regard
","Evicted from his home and separated from his family, rat Remy is living the dream as an unwelcome guest in the kitchen of the famous Gusteau Restaurant in Paris. His passion and gift is cookery and a series of events sees him with soup that had been messed by garbage boy Linguini. Chef Skinner is ready to fire Linguini for his meddling until the customers love 'his' improvised soup. Skinner keeps him on but Linguini knows the truth, striking a deal with Remy where the latter provides the cookery and the former provides the 'looking like a human' bit.Although it won the Oscar for best film, Ratatouille got mixed reviews from critics on release. Watching it for myself I must admit that it exposes the long-term value of the 'best animated feature' aware because it is not a film that should show up as 'best' unless it is in a very short list (which of course it was). This is not to say that the film is no good though and indeed it is a perfectly good story told in a very slick, amusing and engaging way with all the usual quality one would expect from Pixar in regards animation. The story has the usual moral about the importance of the heart over appearance and in this regard it works really well, with a touching character at the core. I refer of course to Remy, because Linguini is all a bit wet as a character.This doesn't matter too much because Linguini is rarely the sole focus in the way that Remy is. The story develops well across the running time and I was never bored once but, and here's the thing, I didn't laugh that often. For me the story was strong enough so that the lack of really good consistent laughs didn't bother me but I can understand why it is an issue for others. In many ways it is because Pixar are victims of their own success and we now expect the strong heartfelt story to be underlain by constant quick fire gags and one-liners. The lack of the latter is not a weakness in the film but it does slightly disappoint until you get into the story.It is not without laughs though but they are more general and less smart than you might expect. The big colourful action is amusing and entertaining and it all drives the good story forward effectively. The voice cast for once is not filled with famous A-list names but you don't feel their absence. Oswalt is the best main character and is better served than Romano with material. Holm is nearly unrecognisable but good, although I'm not so sure about Garofalo's mixed attempt at accent. Dennehy and Sohn are fun in support while O'Toole is a real good piece of casting.Overall this is a really good film that delivers a consistently engaging story with heart and humour. It is not the usual quick-fire one-liner stuff one might expect but it is still an very enjoyable film that both parents and children will enjoy.",Null,1,1,5 May 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," Sterile
","When this reboot came out it felt too close to the most recent series of films and generally it looked uninspired so I gave it a skip but the upcoming release of the sequel made me think that maybe it was worth me checking out. In terms of the plot the majority will be familiar to most people since it is not only a famous character but we only really had this same plot a few years ago. The second half of the film has a different villain than the previous film but really it will all feel like very familiar territory – and this is just one of the problems that the film never totally overcomes.The feeling that the whole film is unnecessary is one that never goes away; it feels superficial and hollow from the very start and even the introductory origin material doesn't scan – it is unconvincing and illogical and this continues all the way to the bite. From here the development into Spiderman is not particularly well done, with a comic tone that isn't warranted or supported by the material. The focus on Peter and Gwen Stacey offers potential but it doesn't come through because it also feels overly superficial and keen to be where it wants to be without actually doing any work to get there on its own. This continues for the remainder of the film as it never really has any heart or any sense of real danger or thrill.The effects do cover for it and there is a natural flow and movement to the characters who are wholly CGI but to be honest, without any real reason to care about what was going on, all I could think was how little you could get these days for over USD200MM. There isn't any grit to it although the bigger surprise to me was that it really wasn't a lot of fun either. Okay we get the wise-cracking Spiderman of old, but it isn't particularly funny and there isn't any wonder, mischief or fun to the character or the action. The performances are fine but mostly wasted because the material isn't there for them; Garfield is fine but Stone doesn't convince and just feels overly flirty. Ifans fails to bring out the tragedy of his character in the way some of those in the previous series managed. Generally this film never stops feeling unnecessary. The story is overly familiar and this telling is uninspiring and uninspired; it has the money on the screen in terms of the effects but otherwise it is disappointingly hollow and Corporate, with no edge, no fun, no spark and no real reason for it to really exist beyond the profitability of the character. I was genuinely surprised by how totally sterile the entire film was.",Null,1,3,13 April 2014
54," Reasonable story with strong sense of period covering the weak characters
","In the 1970's Shane and his friends go out in New York to see if they can get into the exclusive club 54.  Shane gets in but his friends don't, and he immediately falls for the glamorous life.  He gets a job in the club and gradually works his way up from busboy to barman, getting more money, drugs and sex than he can handle.  However as relationships crumble and the excesses become the norm, things are bound to break eventually.
With the success of Boogie Nights, period films from the Seventies were suddenly good business if you could pull them off.  54 is set in the `legendary' nightclub of the same name - although I must confess that the news of this `legendary' place never reached me in rural Northern Ireland, although I was aware of the place before I saw this film.  The lack of introduction to the place put me off a little bit - it expected the audience to already be in awe of this great club without it doing anything to win us over.  From this point in the film takes the narrative on a basic downward spiral of drugs, sex and general excess to act as a sort of cautionary tale against the period.  It does this a little heavily where I would have preferred it to trust me to get the message fro ma straight telling.The character of Shane is the main focus, with him acting as our eyes on the other characters, particularly club owner Steve Rubell.  While it tries to paint a big picture of all the excesses and broken dreams, mainly it only manages to do Shane well and the rest are sort of in the background and not as well drawn and involved as in Boogie Nights.  It still works but it lacks the tapestry effect that would have improved it.The cast are still pretty good.  Generally I hate the bland and expressionless Phillippe, he is not a good actor and he generally leaves me feeling cold by his performances.  Here, partly because he is our entry to the film, I thought he was better than he has been before.  Myers is good although his presence may have been part of people turning up to the film expecting a crude comedy.  He delivers his lines well and seems to enjoy having a straight role to play.  Hayek is OK but Campbell has very little to do.  The supporting cast are OK but the material doesn't fill them out beyond people who we know we will see the `curse' of 54 played onto, much like the `characters' at the start of Casualty who we know something will happen to.Overall this is an enjoyable film that trades off it's good sense of time and place to cover the fact that the material is not as well written as it should have been.  The action is too simple and the characters are not real enough. I hate to compare, but Boogie nights deals with a similar tale but does it much better.",Null,2,5,28 March 2004
The Lego Movie," Doesn't quite have the heart the message needed, but it is still energetic, clever and funny
","It was approaching the end of the year when I finally joined everyone else and enjoyed seeing the Lego Movie, a few seasons after it was released. Although I try not to pay attention to hype and critical response, it did seem like a positive that the same people sneering at Transformers for being a pumped-up toy commercial, were perfectly in love with the Lego Movie even though it is entirely reasonable to point out that it will do that product absolutely no harm to be literally the building blocks of a bright, colorful film where one of the messages is to be creative and mess around with things. The plot is quite light – a perfectly ordinary construction worker who spends his life following instructions and order, suddenly finds himself declared the Special One by a group called the Master Builders, who are racing to prevent Lord Business from destroying the world as they know it.It is a bare bones plot but the flesh put onto it is actually pretty good. With access to a range of characters and franchises, the film has a lot of fun playing with the Lego brand but also the many other brands and characters that it can draw in; this produces a busy film with lots of opportunities for pop culture references and jokes – a lot of which it takes. This is accompanied by lots of frantic action, which is well animated but perhaps just too busy to be fun all the time (often I struggled to really see what was happening amid all the rapid colorful movement – again the type of comment thrown at Transformers but less-so at this). All of this makes it entertaining and the novelty of the Lego is well used to add to the comedy.Towards the end there is a nice development which I thought was pretty clever and well done; it also opens the door to bring heart into the film by virtue of making it more than cat poster messages and snappy one-liners. It has a reasonable try at this but it was a case of leaving it too late, and it hadn't manage to get this aspect to work through the film in the way that it really needed to have done to sell it totally. Still liked it for trying, but it is an extra at the end, not part of the overall being of the film. This feeling of it being very about the moment, slick and polished is ironically not helped by reading the cast list, since it is a great list of names all sharing the time. The positive of this is that off the page, they are all very good in the film itself, even if many of them are basically doing what we know they can/will do. So Pratt is fun and personable but basically is just doing Andy as a Lego figure. Ferrell, Neeson, Banks, Arnett and others are all good while I enjoyed the many smaller turns ranging from Day and Hill through to Daniels and Billy Dee Williams.All told it is lively fun, with plenty of crafted dialogue and delivery, but it is the area of heart where it doesn't totally hit home; leaving it entertaining but perhaps not quite worthy of the hype.",Null,9,14,30 December 2014
Aliens," Classic action thriller
","Starting with an excellent scare twist this film picks up years after Ripley's first encounter with the alien. It transpires that the planet where the first alien was discovered has been populated by a science colony. Ripley is sent with a military unit to discover why the colony has lost contact with earth.Cameron really took a risk here in following up one of the most famous sci-fi's ever.  However he takes Scott's vision and expands it to bring in more terror and more plot.  This situation sees more aliens, more action and introduces the sub-plot that the Government would surely be keen to capture any creature capable of killing enemies.  It's a terrifying thought in itself - all the more terrifying because it is very likely to be true!In terms of the action scenes the film tries to stay close to the atmosphere of the original and the terror of the aliens.  In this it succeeds, opening up what we know about the creatures and keeping the scenes darkly lit and moody.  Even though we see more of the creatures the shadows still keep the feeling of the unknown.Weaver is good and is surrounded by several well known character actors (Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser) but there is little room for character development.  The fact that Ripley has slept while everyone she knows has died is not really investigated that much.  However this is a minor complaint about a classic action movie.It was never going to be easy to follow the original but Cameron does a good job.  However where the original movie was a sci-fi horror movie this is a main stream sci-fi action movie with guns and explosions taking away from the horror.",Null,4,7,17 October 2001
Dallas Buyers Club," Consistent and engaging story told with a strong lead performance and a refreshing lack of sentimentality
","This film came to the UK with the usual awards hype that seems to accompany any number of bigger films that are released around this time, but I had made an effort to avoid it and didn't know too much about it other than McConaughey being talked up about his performance. Indeed I had ignored it as much as I could and to the point where I really knew the barebones of the plot – which was to say it was a true story of a guy who got HIV and, frustrated by the lack of medical treatment at the time, decided to start running effective drugs unapproved by the FDA across the Mexican border into the US. With this very basic grasp I did worry that the film would be sentimental, making a hero of the main character, playing up the plight of the infected and generally being the sort of film they wheel out for awards at this time of year, ticking all the topics off that gets voters onboard.Happily the truth is that, although there is an element of this, the film doesn't overplay to this side of its nature and instead delivers a remarkable straight telling without too much excess. The character of Ron is a hustler first and everything else second and this doesn't change once he finally gets through the 'bargaining, anger, denial, acceptance' stages of his diagnosis. As a result his efforts to bring in the drugs are not done out of some selfless act of wanting to help others as he prepares to meet his maker, but rather as part of his own fight for life he hits on a scheme to make money – and for the majority of the film this is the case. This central truth to the character really works to rob the film of sentimentality of him and therefore of the wider situation and it makes for a better film because we are engaged because we are interested rather than becomes a sweeping musical score or 'Oscar clip' moment tells us to feel something. It does still do this and it does still bring out the sense of people struggling to live while the structure supposed to help them does little about it, but it does so in a way that is refreshingly free of smaltz.Although this is a strength, it should also be said that the film doesn't manage to bring it all together as well as it should given the subject matter. It just feels like it falls a few steps short of greatness in terms really delivering an emotional punch that informs on the individual and the bigger picture at the same time – it does do this, but it is more consistent rather than building to this. Despite this it still works and although it lacks these real highs of delivery, it was functional and successful and I appreciated the lack of easy sentiment. The performances match this and in particular McConaughey gets the tone of the film and by return sets it. He is great, not because of the weight loss but because he delivers an unsympathetic character and convinces as him whether he is raging in denial, hustling or hurting. He is the heart of the film and it works as well as it works thanks a lot to him. The support characters are never more than supporting though, but of course Leto is strong in his role – not because he cross-dresses, but because he is the character and he makes Rayon about much more than the appearance. Zahn, Garner, O'Neill, Dunne and other recognizable faces all do solid work but primarily this is McConaughey's film.Dallas Buyers Club may not be perfect but it is consistent and it is engaging. I appreciate that it never resorts to easy smaltz or cheap sentimentality and it seems perfectly fine with its flawed character being flawed throughout the film. It is a well told story which links well from the individual's story into the bigger picture, even if it doesn't quite impact at that level as it could have done. Within the solid and effective frame of this story, McConaughey then seals the deal with a really strong lead performance as he takes yet another massive leap away from being that guy leaning against the title on the bus poster.",Null,12,15,8 February 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Mildly entertaining stuff for teenagers  hardly exciting or dramatic enough
","A gang of drivers are pulling off high speed hijacks of trucks and stealing their cargo.  Undercover cop Brian O'Conner is sent in to infiltrate one of the numerous street racing crews who are suspected of the crime.  He wins over Dominic Toretto, the head of one such crew and begins his investigation.  However the closer he gets to the crew and the more he gets into the culture, the harder it is to do his job.One weekend I was considering going to see 2 Fast 2 Furious but decided to go and rent the first movie before I see the sequel or else how would I be able to follow the plot and characters (oh  how optimistic I was!).  So I rented this film knowing that it had received better reviews than the sequel.  I expected stylish thrills and exciting high speed action with a weak plot  I was half right.  The plot was pretty weak and full of clichés  from the `going native undercover cop' to the `urban' lingo that everyone tries to speak in.It doesn't really make much sense and it is a pretty fragile house of cards that comes crashing down logic-wise if you ask too many questions.  However, to focus on the plot here is wasting my time and yours, as it matters little  this is an action movie, not a drama.  I expected the action to be slick and breathless given the speeds involved however I was really disappointed. Aside from a few directorial flourishes that make it all appear much more exciting than it is, the car action is actually quite normal.  Even the climatic hijacking is done with no feeling of `edge of seat thrills' although it looks impressive.  I'm sure many will be taken in by the sheer slickness of the thing, but I found the action to be soulless and lacking in any real excitement.The cast are a line of urban clichés who sound like every suburban teenager in the Western world tries to sound. Walker is bland and manages to make Vin Diesel look like he's acting hard.  In fairness Diesel was responsible for the only scene I found dramatic (where Toretto finds out who O'Conner is) by doing good work with his face  but for the rest he was simply a tough guy lacking in the charisma needed to do a likeable bad guy.  Rodriguez looks good but is better than this.  Brewster is surprisingly plain given the amount of eye candy on display and the rest of the support cast simply mug (Ja Rule included).  More often I found myself watching the crowds who were populated with beautiful girls who were cynically edited in at every chance to try and get the teenage boys coming back for more.  I'm not complaining, but it is hard not to feel a little exploited when the film has a lingering shot of two gorgeous girls snogging for no reason other than visual titillation.Overall, like the cars themselves this is a very slick vehicle but I found it to be ultimately empty and soulless.  The plot is meaningless and the script one cliché after another.  The action scenes are ordinary and it is a major failing of the film that it doesn't manage to translate the thrill of 140 mph races etc onto the screen.  If you want to see a road race done better I suggest an exciting scene in the Jackie Chan 1995 film `Pi li ho'  that I found exciting, this I just found to be hollow and noisy.",Null,3,6,29 June 2003
Control," Good but doesn't really get inside the focal point of the film in the way it needed to
","Ian Curtis works at an employment exchange in Manchester where he deals all day with the unemployed and perhaps unemployable. An off-beat and quite cold character, he does have a creative side and it is this that ultimately leads him to become the lead singer for a band called Warsaw. This happens at just the right time as local television presenter Tony Wilson starts promoting local music and a local promoter becomes the group's manager. Joy Division (as they are now called) are born, sign to Factory Records and start getting bigger locally and nationally. However Ian's challenges with depression and epilepsy become greater as he feels his life slipping out of control.I came to this film with two conflicting things in mind. Firstly that Control had been praised by most reviewers but then, secondly, I don't know much about Joy Division as my age put this just on the wrong side of my interest in music and popular culture. So in some ways I was perhaps protected from some of the criticism of the film but then conversely I was not exposed to weaknesses in the material that I would not have known. When it came to watching the film itself I found myself perhaps shielded in this regard because I didn't feel the lack of parts of Curtis' life mainly because I was not informed enough to spot omissions. However there is no denying that there are omissions and that perhaps the film doesn't deliver that well even within the bounds that it sets itself.For me everything I know about the period and the band has come from documentaries on Factory Records and from 24 Hour Party People so for me I didn't really want or need another film that covers the period, hence my interest in Control. So focusing on Curtis himself was a good move but it does then mean that the film needs to engage simply on a character that will be real to some viewers but not to others. For me I found enough of interest but never really felt like I had gotten to the heart of Curtis in regards his conflicting and contrasting character traits of needing but yet pushing away, depression, fan pressure and creativity. It does well at certain points but mostly we are on the outside, seeing Curtis as difficult without really getting past that. The music adds appeal to this approach while the character of Deborah adds passion and emotion that is surprisingly lacking in much of it.The city of Manchester has been noted as being absent but again, having never been there, this wasn't an issue for me as it was for others. On the contrary I thought the locations were fine even if I didn't really get a sense of period (although all the right cars were sitting around the streets). The cinematography blesses it all with a crisp black and white look and Corbijn's direction was solid without being particularly flashy. Since Riley has already been praised there is no pressure on me to heap it on him as well. He is convincing (speaking as someone seeing his character as just that  a character) but I never got inside his head. Morton for me is better mainly because of how much of a lift she gives the film  her performance injects energy and gave me somewhere to put my emotional interest in the story. The supporting cast are good with turns from Kebbell, Parkinson, Naylor and others all solid and enjoyable.So as a fresh pair of eyes Control is both strong and weak. Without any knowledge of Curtis beyond documentaries I was less protective or critical of a portrayal but yet I was left on the outside of his character  which is a problem considering he is the film. The events around Curtis, the period and the emotional core in Deborah help carry it, allowing the good aspects of the portrayal to come out but not to the point where the weaknesses were totally covered. A good film, but perhaps not as brilliant as the British media (understandably) hyped it to be.",Null,1,3,28 May 2008
Now You See Me," Slick all-star nonsense is still nonsense
","Now You See Me starts out really well. A group of illusionists are brought together and within a year they are playing Vegas together and appear to rob a bank in Paris remotely. This draws in the FBI and Interpol but how can they prove anything when it all seems so impossible and so hard to prove? This setup offers a twisty and engaging plot but sadly it is one that never gets delivered upon. Instead what we get is a constantly moving film that is loaded with stars, money and special effects but nothing of nay real substance.This approach works really well when it comes to the slickness of delivery and how polished it all feels, but it is so very unsatisfying as a whole product. The twists and turns of the film are almost all nonsense – slickly elaborate and delivered with pace for sure, but with nothing behind of any substance. As a result I stopped caring about the plot or about working out what was going on behind the theatrics. Movement appeared to be the all and after a while I tired of it. The slick delivery is all well and good and it is added to by the cast – so many faces, so many quality actors all getting handsomely paid but doing very little. It felt like a waste.It isn't a terrible film by any means; the pace and slickness makes it work on that level but it does very little else which is engaging or memorable. It is fluff that fills the time but leaves you with nothing after that.",Null,3,4,26 October 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Enjoyable and satisfying blockbuster thanks to engaging narrative which is well delivered by all
","I don't remember being overly taken by the previous X-Men film, although I may be wrong because it has mostly slipped from my memory after it took quite some time for me to get around to watching it in the first place. Days of Future Past came out in a busy summer season and it did strike me as just another superhero blockbuster in a very crowded marketplace. Although it of course has much in common with other superhero films, X-Men doesn't directly take them on at their own game and, although it has the odd touch here and there, it deliberately avoids the knockabout comedy that The Avengers film and some of its offshoots has. Instead we get a darker plot that begins in the future where mutants are either enslaved or killed by robots designed specifically for that purpose. The plot device that triggers the time-travel is as easy to accept as anything else in the film, and it is delivered fairly straight which also helps. This gives us a plot where we know the stakes and the film plays it very well to keep things dramatic.Having very recently been disappointed by the superficial thrills of Godzilla, I pleased to find that Days of Future Past was an engaging and satisfying film to watch – although I personally think that its current very high rating on IMDb is partially down to an overreaction to low expectations set by First Class. The plot has some good twists and turns and it connects the future and present well. Special effects are well used throughout, with plenty going on that is visible (I'm looking at you Godzilla) and most importantly, is connected to the plot; so yes the film has spectacle, but it is spectacle that the viewer cares about rather than passively watches.The cast helps give the material some weight and, although some of them have comparatively little to do, they all do well enough with what they are given. Jackman is as good as presence as ever and there is a reason he and this character remain so constant through the series. Fassbender and McAvoy have good material to work with and they engage and convince as to their connection to their future castings of Stewart and McKellen. Lawrence is surprisingly good and although she seems a bit out of place at first, it is her performance that makes her character work. Dinklage is always watchable and he fits in well amongst a cast that includes many famous faces in roles small and big. The balance of all these names and faces is down to how enjoyable the script is, because even though we barely see some people, it makes sense within the context of the story being told, so doesn't feel like they are wasted (although I could have done with a few fewer in the final scenes).Days of Future Past is perhaps not as amazing as the high IMDb rating suggests, but it is an enjoyable and satisfying superhero movie with good edge and seriousness in the plot, which is all played straight aside from a few moments, helping it carry it off and keep the viewer engaged.",Null,4,6,5 October 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Good narrative base, which produces good action but doesn't have the heft it suggests it wants
","I was not overly taken with the previous Avengers film, but I have enjoyed the Captain America series – although, being honest, if I watched them unaware of the title, I would not be able to tell one over the other with much success. This one in particular feels like an ensemble piece (as they all do) although the return of the Winter Soldier and the focus on Captain America does make it fit. The plot as themes of vigilantism, of revenge, of anger, all of which spin around each other with an air that suggests the film is trying to blur moral lines between the characters.In theory it does this reasonably well – or at least to describe it out loud it sounds like it must work. In the film though it doesn't seem to push for this aspect so much as just use it. So the film is driven by this, and all the characters have equal validity and tragedy to their motivations; however this is not the same as it being done with a lot of brain and heart. In this regard it doesn't deliver, although it does provide a more interesting base than the usual 'global threat from beyond' that some of the other films have had. On this it builds good action; for sure they are often large and with plenty going on, but many have good fluidity of movement and dramatic delivery – the action has some weight to it, rather than feeling like watching someone play a video game.The performances are all well-judged, with good mix of humor and dramatic presence. For sure it is not a film where the actors will bother the awards season too much, but they sell their characters and their threads well. There are perhaps too many characters for them to really do them all justice (Spiderman for instance feels rushed into the film, and more about making another film I think); by contrast a cameo for Antman was enjoyable. Mostly the focus is kept reasonably tight on the main few, and the new characters generally add to the themes (Black Panther).It isn't brilliant but it is an enjoyable blockbuster with an interesting narrative base, enjoyable plotting, and action which does more than just wiggle its CGI in your face.",Null,2,7,18 September 2016
Gandhi," Deserves to be as highly regarded as it is
","As a young man, Gandhi travelled to South Africa to take up a position as a lawyer. However when he is thrown off the train for refusing to get his 'black arse' out of the first class carriages, he finds that he has become a third class citizen. With the blessing of his employer, Gandhi resolves to create a stir and get the bad treatment of Indians in South Africa changed to be equal in the law to the English people. Burning passes is the first step towards a life spent in peaceful protest, massive social change and ultimate assassination.Taking on the unenviable task of doing justice to the life of Gandhi in a matter of three hours, Richard Attenborough has produced a professional film that presents the story in an engaging, easy to follow way that sees the hours slip effortlessly by. It is easy to suggest that the worthiness of the story tells itself but in reality this must have been a nightmare to script and then to edit into a film that has an impact, flows but yet still does the subject justice  that it does all these is to its credit. The story picks the highlights of his life and moves it forward well; one criticism is perhaps the fact that it doesn't totally convey the sacrifice of a lifetime given over to the struggle but in fairness it gets as close as it was ever going to get. Starting at the end the film shows us the growth of Gandhi and it does it very slickly. Attenborough's direction is strong and the use of locations is impressive  the film never really loses the sense of place, time or people that it creates from the very start.The cast greatly helps this sense of place and they are led by a fantastic performance from Ben Kingsley, who marked this film as the one he will always be best known for no matter what else he does. It helps that he resembles Gandhi and that he can do the accent but his performance is still suitable for the man and manages to come across as a person without losing the saintly air he has around him. He is well supported by a host of Indian actors (Om Puri, Jaffrey etc) and extras as well as Western stars including Fox, Gielgud, Mills, Sheen, Hawthorne, Griffiths and a young Day-Lewis; however there is never any doubt that he is he star of this film and he never disappoints.Overall this film has a high reputation and nothing I can say can add to it. It is highly regarded and a simple viewing will tell you why  it looks great, does a great job with period, a great job with condensing the story and generally very strong performances with Kingsley deservedly winning many awards for it. Well worth seeing, especially if you don't know anything about Gandhi's life.",Null,6,14,6 February 2006
American History X," Not perfect but still very strong
","Years have past since Danny saw his neo-nazi brother, kill several black males who were robbing his car.  Since he has been in prison, Derek's legacy has grown among the white gangs of the area and Danny has followed in his brother's footsteps.  When he writes a racist paper for school, his teacher makes his write a new paper, focusing on recent history  that of his brother and how he influenced him.  Meanwhile Derek leaves prison a reformed man with only the desire to repair the damage he once did to his family with his beliefs and his hate.I was looking forward to see this film as I missed it at the cinema and am a firm believer that Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is always worth seeing (even if some of his films have given less than he deserves).  It was maybe better that I only saw it recently as I was able to enjoy it without all the hype and fighting over who did what to who, or all the comments from director Kaye as to his opinions of the film.  Having seen the pompous fool interviewed several times, I find it quite self assuring that I don't agree with his opinions of it!The plot is a mix of flashback into Derek's hate filled past (told in b&w) and the present (colour) where he is desperate to save his brother and family from suffering anymore from his `sins'.  As a basic narrative the film struggles at times to make a solid story and seems to be trying too hard to create confrontations to up the drama within the film.  It still works mind you but this is not it's best asset.The main thing the film does well is to be a very true representation of white male disillusionment.  The film avoids painting these people as monsters straightaway (although makes no bones that they are confused, misled and wrong).  The arguments and discussions they have in the film are not so far from reality that the characters seem fiction  the characters and the film's world seem very real.  The film's message that hate is no way to live no matter who it is directed at may be a little simplistic but it is a valid point.  One particular weakness which I felt was a little hamfisted was Derek's `road to Damascus' experience in prison  it was OK but was far too easy given the character we had just seen brutally kill several black men.The other main selling point the film has is a performance by Norton that simply ensures he steals nearly every scene he is in.  In b&w flashback he is at his best  a larger than life character who is never allowed to just be seen as a thug.  Norton acts out the various stages of his life well and makeup ensures that he looks younger when required.  In the present he is less dominant but still is very good giving a different performance. Furlong is also very strong, although he only has a few scenes where he is able to be outside of Norton's shadow.  Support from Balk, Gould, D'Angelo and Brooks is mixed  Gould's Jewish character is only in the film to allow for one scene to occur, while Brooks' righteous teacher is simply a `morally upright teacher' with no meat on his character.Overall this is a good film, which occasionally struggles when it forces the issue in the `present' scenes.  However for the most part it is a powerful film which owes a lot to well captured themes and an excellent performance from Norton.",Null,36,53,8 November 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Fresh faced, extremely cool and slick  yes it's shallow but so what? Eat popcorn and enjoy
","Freshly released from jail Danny Ocean begins to recruit key players to put together a job as daring as it is dangerous - the safe that holds the money for 3 casinos belonging to Terry Benedict.  As well as splitting the $150 million between the gang, Danny also plans to steal back his ex-wife Tess who is currently dating Benedict.The first movie wasn't exactly brilliant - only really interesting because it brought the whole rat pack together onscreen for the first time.  This could have easily fallen into the same trap - trading purely on the stars' names rather than an intrinsic entertainment value.  However it manages to take what worked from the original and give it a great modern shine.  The story is daft of course, but it moves forward with a sort of slick illogical cleverness that appears wonderfully clever but is, of course, highly unlikely!  The story unfolds in an entertaining manner, the build up is great with no dull moments as we meet the characters and find out the details of the job bit by bit.The job itself is well handled.  It is so slick that you don't mind that it couldn't possibly work in real life, but instead it just appears so clever! The romantic subplot I found to be a little redundant and I didn't think that Clooney and Roberts had good chemistry - compared to Clooney and Lopez in another great Sodenberg film `Out of Sight' where the screen crackled! However it takes up little screen time and compliments the heist quite well. Sodenberg handles the film well and doesn't allow his direction to be slick without substance - the editing is clever and Las Vegas internally and externally looks great.Clooney is fantastic in the lead - his strength is that he has great charisma which means he doesn't have to ham it up.  Instead he does his stuff but allows others to try and shine while he is comfortable with a constant warm glow.  Pitt does likewise - he doesn't try to hog the glory but hangs around being smooth for most of the time.  This allows Pitt and Clooney to be the two leads without taking away from the ensemble feel - they also have a good relationship going here.  Roberts is OK but didn't convince me that Clooney would risk so much for her.  Affleck and Cann are good in a sort of comedy double act role - they don't have a lot of scenes but they are funny.  Old hands Gould (so good to see him on the big screen) and Carl Riener effortlessly steal all their scenes and Matt Damon seems happy to be on a smaller part than the other stars and has a rookie sort of role.  Andy Garcia has a poor role as the bad guy and doesn't manage to bring him to life - although he does make him unlikeable when next to Clooney.  However, Don Cheadle, a great actor, needs a real kicking for ruining things with a terrible cockney accent that makes Dick Van Dyke sound genuine.  Happily he doesn't actually have that many lines - and he only has two scenes where he has to say more than 2 sentences at a time - but really he is just terrible.  Someone please explain - why his character is English? Then someone explain - why they just didn't get an English star to play it?Overall any criticisms against this are minor and are missing the point. It's not meant to be a classic or get Sodenberg more Oscar nominations. Instead it's a slick little package that is kept afloat by a starry cast, a cool soundtrack and a nice (if silly) plot.  Sit, watch, chill, enjoy, forget.",Null,95,110,26 February 2002
Spirited Away," Beautifully animated story with good characters and fantastic story of love and friendship
","While on their way to their new house in a new town, Chihiro and her parents take a short cut down a side road and come to a dead end with a dark passage way in a wall.  Despite her fears, Chihiro goes with her parents to see where it leads.  They come out in open space where they find what looks like an abandoned theme park.  Chihiro's parents find a stall with lots of food prepared and start to eat while Chihiro refuses and goes to investigate a working bath house.  As it suddenly gets dark she goes back to her parents to find they have been turned into pigs and suddenly shadows draw over the stalls.  Chihiro hides with the help of a boy called Haku.  He helps her to stay in the bathhouse by getting her a job (as dictated by Yubaba) and she settles into the resort for Japan's gods and spirits.  However she still must work out a way of getting her parents back before they grow fat and are eaten.The first I had heard of this film was when it won the Oscar (sadly this was the one part of my combination bet that I had got wrong and hence won nothing).  Since then the film has had world-wide promotion and arrived in the UK several years after it had first been shown.  Despite the worrying `Walt Disney' legend at the front of the credits, this is very much a Miyazaki film and the mouse has not turned it into something else.  My second worry was that the American team involved in the version I saw would bring out sarcasm in the same way as they (Lasseter) does in things like Monsters Inc etc.  I enjoy that style of humour but `Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' was much better than just that.The plot involves the quest to recover Chihiro's parents from a spell that made them pigs, but the world in which the film is set is what makes it so enjoyable.  The world is imaginative and filled with all sorts of characters. Chihiro's journey explores themes of understanding, trust and friendship  all around the central quest, and in this way it is good that some parents I know have been taking their kids to see this film even if it isn't tied into a Happy Meal marketing campaign.  The characters are all pretty well developed and are interesting.  Chihiro is afraid but brings bravery from inside herself, Haku is a mystery but appears trustworthy, the mysterious noface could be a friend or foe.  What the film doesn't have is characters who do nothing  they all drive the story forward or provide the comic relief in some way.The American cast do good jobs dubbing the characters.  Usually dubbed films are so poor that I always seek out subtitles, however here the job was as it were meant.  Chase is very good in one of her two Oscar nominated films that year and Mardsen has much more to do than in the X-Men films!  Support voices are all good and involve plenty of recognisable voices such as Chiklis, Holly, Ratzenberger and Stiers.The film is a lot more accessible than much anime  sure there are still monsters and spirits but there are no major battles and way out visuals to deal with, kids can watch this (and should).  In fact I did quite like the simplicity of the tale.  Whereas kids movies recently tend towards the more sarcastic, cruel humour as much for adults, here the film is more about spirit (no pun) and moral courage.  It is also worth noting that, although there is magic, this is not some spectacle film like Harry Potter  Chihiro uses her brain and her heart to deal with things, not spells.The animation is fantastic  while CGI has been used, it never feels as totally computerised as Monster Inc etc does.  This isn't BETTER because it was hand drawn but it does fell a lot warmer and a lot more recognisable in terms of style.  The use of both techniques gives much to the look of the film.  As always the world and the characters come to life on the screen and are fantastic, creepy and beautiful all at once.I don't mean to gush but I did enjoy this film for all it's simplistic plotting.  The quest is a straightforward plot device and would be a problem if that's all this film had to offer.  Happily the central story is supported by characters who are wonderfully drawn (both animated and developed) and set in a world that is visually impressive and imaginative. I looked at my watch and wondered where two hours had gone.",Null,3,5,21 September 2003
Pearl Harbor," The action impresses, the romance plods, the dialogue is horrible, the characters are cardboard and the clichés grate
","Contains Spoiler!! A matter of weeks before he is due to leave for England having volunteered to fight with the RAF, Capt Rafe McCawley meets and falls for Evelyn Johnson.  He leaves very much in love with her but, when he is supposedly killed in action, his best friend (Danny) has to tell Evelyn that he is dead.  As they turn to one another for support and healing they gradually fall in love.  When Rafe is found alive he returns to America and finds his best friend in love with his girlfriend.  This complex love triangle is made even more complex when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour and draw America into World War II.You can see why they made this film - a major emotional centrepiece, around which a Hollywood love story between beautiful people occurs; sounds like another Titanic right? I do not understand why that film became so very popular and showered with awards, but I do understand why Pearl Harbour did so badly critically (but it sadly still did make several hundred million dollars - something the gloaters tend to forget!).  The good thing about the film is the action - it seems to be the only thing that Michael Bay can really do well. You can see where the money was spent and it is pretty exciting.  The only reservation I had about it was that Bay cannot help but deliver the action like Bad Boys rather than Saving Private Ryan - in other words the sheer horror of the attack is lost in a sea of glossy special effects, slick camera movements and big bangs, it looks great but it is difficult to really be shocked or moved in the way that the events really should have.  Sure, the shots of bodies and the hospitals sort of bring it home but you can't help but feel the majority of the action is rather soulless.  Of course, very like Bay, he doesn't know when to end and after the attack he follows the action to America's retaliation - where Rafe `shows 'em what for' - here the action is silly and just far too simplistic for the subject involved.I think it was the other `qualities' the film has that made it such a hated film.  The romance that is supposed to engage us with the three main characters is horribly banal and only serves to make the film's first half feel significantly longer than it really is.  The romance fails for two big reasons.  First of all, there are zero characters; they are plodding cardboard creations with all-American qualities and strong jaw lines. They were never real people to me and I swear this film could have ended with each of them being torn to bloody shreds by Japanese bulldogs and I would have struggled to care less - even the almost constant use of Hans Zimmers' score can't make this emotionally involving.  Secondly the script is a woefully inept piece of rubbish that makes the Telebubbies feel like the pinnacle of modern writing.  At best the lines just seem clunky and unnatural; at worst they are heavy with cliché and just smack of lazy writing - when I'd heard Afflect shout `get me in a plane NOW' for the third time or Hartnett announce `world war 2 has started' (oh - so it didn't in 1939?) I was already starting to feel my ears bleed.  Basically if it is not all clichéd tough talk then it is corny romance dialogue - neither work and only serve to further destroy the foundations of an already weak film.The acting fits perfectly with the standard of characterisation and dialogue and is roundly average despite having a pretty impressive list of names in the cast.  Affleck is not a leading man and nothing he has done since Good Will Hunting has convinced me that he can carry a film: like it or not, DiCaprio was part of Titanic's success - Affleck is part of Pearl Harbour's failing.  He is nothing more than a rugged face, square jawed hero type American boy - the only silver lining to the film is that at least a good script wasn't wasted on his flat and uninvolving delivery.  Hartnett is no better but least is pretty to look at; it's just a shame that that is all he is.  Beckinsale is a nonentity who is given nothing to do and therefore does almost nothing.  Why (or how) these two men fell for her was never made clear.  Gooding Jr is so poorly used that I wondered why the film even bothered to keep him in it. He is poorly fitting to the period (talking in modern ethnic clichés - a further sign of lazy writing) and he exists to give us a vague focus on the ships and also be the first black soldier to get a medal (`but not the last' the film reassuringly confirms).  As poorly used as they are, at least it is interesting to see faces like Jennifer Garner, Dan Aykroyd, Adam Baldwin, Sizemore, Voight, Tagawa, Everett, Diehl, Coates and Fichtner.  The only shame is that most of them have little to do and that some of them just seem really out of place (Aykroyd and Tagawa in particular).Overall, compared to the mix of spiteful or unfairly adoring reviews that are around, this might seem a balanced one but understand that I really do consider this a waste of film and time.  Bay does the action with style but sadly missing the soul that the situation required.  The romance is awful and is a major problem since this was supposed to be our foundation and the script shows a complete inability to develop characters or put anything other than clichéd dialogue into their mouths.",Null,33,54,5 May 2004
Duck You Sucker," A typically strong Leone film with added interesting political content
","John Malloy is an IRA explosives expert, on the run in Mexico. Juan Miranda is a Mexican bandit with no interest in the political upheaval in his country and only a dream of hitting the large bank his father once failed to rob. When the two meet, Juan sees John's explosives as the way into the ban, but John has no interest and it is only when Juan frames him for the murder of some senior soldiers that John relents. Arriving in the town, the bank looks like a simple hit if they can find some way of distracting the masses of soldiers that now control the small town  luckily the revolution is in full swing and rebels are in great demand; but it is not long before Juan's idea of a simple bank robbery sees him up to his neck in a struggle that he has no interest in.Many reviewers have said how strong the Leone formula is and I won't be able to add much to their words but for me this is a fine film mainly because it takes apart yet another of the cinema myths of the noble revolutionary fighters and has a fascinating thread of political commentary running all the way through it. It doesn't open this way though, rather it starts with Leone's usual brand of wit and confrontation between John and Juan and it all feels like it will be similar (and just as good) to some of Leone's other westerns. However, about an hour in, it becomes more interesting thanks to the rather shocking portrayal of the revolution (on both sides) and the ripping into the ideas behind it. It only adds to the basic plot and, when it becomes the main focus, the film is stronger for it, although Leone's Marxist views may be a little hard to swallow for some viewers in the west. That said, it does still work as a typical Leone western and fans of his will still love this film.The cast is good but you gotta wonder how those accents would have been mauled if the film had not been as roundly good  certainly Coburn's attempts at an Irish brogue are not the most convincing I've heard. Other than that though he is good in the lead role, coping well with making an IRA character 'likeable' without damaging the cynicism and regret that exists within him. His flashback scenes are convincing even if it is not that important to the main thrust of the film. Steiger is less serious at first but develops his character well, despite having to cope with a 'road to Damascus' moment as part of it. He is consistently amusing as a character and he does tend to dominate his scenes to good effect. Support is fine but really these two men are the film and they do it very well, coping with the laughs, tension and political commentary equally well.Overall, a typically strong film from Leone that has all his usual formula touches as well as plenty of commentary of value. The direction and use of music are as good as always and the cast cope well with the demands of the script. Reviewers who have taken this as an attack on John Ford's idea of the revolutionary Irishman are perhaps a little off since the film only confirms Ford's usual pointing out of 'printing the myth' but it still has plenty of value and interesting political commentary.",Null,36,47,6 June 2005
Underground," Clever satire with a wicked black humour  but drags once or twice
","Starting with the German bombing of Belgrade in 1941 this film follows two men who are hailed as heroes for their actions during the war. Marko hides people in his basement during the war and they produce guns for the war effort.  Petar a.k.a. Blacky is a real war hero and an inspiration to his people, but after his capture and torture he is taken to the basement for safety.  After the war  Marko doesn't tell the people that it's over and profits from their arms production.  As years do by Marko rewrites history to suit him.Winner of the Palme D'Or, I still didn't expect too much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It starts well with the bombing of a zoo etc and has several big set piece scenes.  It also has a healthy rash of black comedy (witness Blacky polish his shoes with a passing cat without comment!) but it drags at times.  The story itself is about how heroes are made and how history is rewritten, but nothing changes.  The people emerge from the basement to find the war over, but a new war has taken it's place.As a satire on this I can get it, however I'm not familiar enough with Yugoslavia to fully understand some of the underlying currents.  The humour is quite dark but the points are there to be seen.  Another comment said that he couldn't understand the whole thing with the people being in the basement for so long..you have to wonder what he thought he was watching!The final redemption is a nice comment on war, but really it suggests that the film is deep and meaningful.  However epic or clever it appears I suspect that it isn't as deep as it would like to be.Overall the cast are good, it is funny, clever and has some good points to make about different types of people through history.  But at times it drags and appears to think that it is more meaningful than it is.  On the whole and good film and a worthy winner.",Null,7,16,30 March 2002
Tropic Thunder," Although it is right on the edge of disaster, the film is actually pretty funny and smart if you go with it
","When an all-star Vietnam film is put in the hands of a first time British director, the results are an ego-dominated shambles that is a month behind schedule after only five days of shooting. Director Damien Cockburn makes a decision that the experiences of 'Four Leaf' Tayback will be best captured on film by dropping the basic cast in the jungle and forcing them to experience as close to reality as possible while catching it all on camera. Sadly when Cockburn is killed by a mine mere minutes into the mission, the cast are left in the middle of a dangerous jungle, not entirely sure of whether this is real or not.When I went to see this film I hadn't expected it to be much more than a basic comedy but the reality is that this is a pretty smart satire of Hollywood and movie acting that also produces silly laughs one would expect from a Ben Stiller film. The 'black-face' issue has been mentioned in regards the film walking a fine line between being funny or offensive but to me the bigger tightrope act is between being funny and being stupidly silly. Here and there it gets very close to falling over that line (eg all of Tom Cruise's stuff) but if you are with it then it manages to just about stay on the right side of the line. The daft plot allows for micky-taking in regards big studio action movies, spoilt actors, bad projects, studio executives and so on  it is never sensible but it is mostly very funny. I think the film doesn't always succeed though because it sort of straddles two stools and those who want one or the other will have reservations while the smaller number who recognise both stools will perhaps see flaws on both. To explain that better I should probably say what I mean rather than referring to furniture and backsides. See as a satire it is undeniably broad and clumsy with the digs being made in clever but still quite obvious ways and you do have plenty of laughs that are knock-about that don't sit with those looking for smart satire. On the other hand you have those who love the silliness of it but don't really 'get' it when it is trying to make digs even if they laugh their heads off at a character eating blood in the misunderstanding of it being a special effect. Somehow though it just about works by just going all out for it and things like the racial issues, anti-Semitic stuff etc all hang together sufficiently.The cast are a big part of making it work. Stiller is solid throughout and works his character as well as he makes fun of him. Downey Jr is very impressive as the deep-method actor who produces the controversy. Black is a necessary evil but at least his character's drug addiction makes him of value within the satire even if his performance is still a fat guy shouting. I liked the support from both Baruchel and Jackson, who held their own alongside the starry cast. The rest of the cast include solid turns from Nolte, Coogan, Maguire (great superhero movie reference), Pollack and others are all in the shadow of a great Tom Cruise who to me is the one we should be talking about when it comes to controversy tightropes. He is always about an inch away from being embarrassingly silly but yet he pulls it off.Tropic Thunder is not a perfect film by any means. The satire and the knock-about humour don't compliment one another that well but somehow it all works and the majority of the risky moves are pulled off even if it is not quite as clever as it would like to be. To some it will be the stupidest thing they have ever seen, to others  the funniest; the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is enjoyable for it.",Null,76,143,15 October 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Walks a very fine line but just about manages to carry the film with good laughs and a great sense of style and design
","I heard a lot of gushing about this film's originality and brilliance so I approached it with caution. At the same time I was aware that some hated it and that it had underperformed at the box office – and again I had tried to put this out of my mind and just see what it did for me. Having watched it myself I have to agree that I can see the arguments from both sides but only partial agree with either. The film is not awful, but nor is it brilliant – but what it does do is know its intentions really well and all parts of it work to that goal.The end result is a film that will play strongly with target audience and maybe some outside it taken by its freshness, but that will leave many casual viewers cold and perhaps a little hostile to the meaningless bombardment that I imagine some will feel this film is. I understand this because the film walks a very fine line because so much of it is reliant on the style and energy of the delivery and to some, if this doesn't work, then the rest will fall flat. The entire film is wrapped in pop culture but mostly the influence on the design and delivery is that of Japanese animation, comic books and old school video gaming. While the gaming part of it speaks to me most, the rest is delivered with such consistency and energy that I found it refreshing and clever in how it is done.What helps it a lot is that it is all done with real warmth and heart – it is not a cold exercise in mimicking styles, but rather a nice little romantic comedy delivered as such. It is frequently funny and light and, most importantly, the consistency allows it to convince within its own world. Had the film had moments outside of its approach (eg scenes specifically to move the plot forward) then it would have knocked the legs away, revealing that it is 'doing' this approach rather than 'being' it. Fortunately it doesn't do it this way and the consistent and note-perfect delivery is really well done, bringing the viewer in and keeping them in this world so those that 'get it' will not question it.The cast get this too and they are great at matching their director's vision for the film. Cera is strong in the lead and plenty of the material exercises the comic timing and smart wit that fans of Arrested Development loved him for before he became a bit of a pastiche of himself with his many awkward roles. Ramona is the type of girl that would annoy me in real life, but yet Winstead makes me like her (or at least not dislike her). The support cast are generally good and most of the seven 'ex's' are colourful and bring a lot of fun to their parts. Wright's direction is great though – I would love to see the story boarding for this film just because it was so well done that it must have been planned out to the smallest detail to make it as steady as it was.Scott Pilgrim is not as brilliant as some would have you believe but nor is it as bad as others would try to convince you it is. For target audience it will be like catnip, for those totally removed from the world it uses then it may be awful apart from feeling fresh and energetic. Personally I felt that its short comings were compensated for with how inventive, consistent, enjoyable and warm it all was. Although it is mostly about the style of delivery, it has enough heart and comedy to avoid being a case of style over substance – it is perhaps close, but it is on the right side of the line.",Null,2,9,18 November 2010
The Usual Suspects," A twisty classic
","After a gun fight on the docks leaves only one survivor with the majority dead, NYC agent Dave Kujan flies in to ensure that ex-cop Dean Keaton is really dead.  During the questioning the survivor, Verbal Kint, tells of how events came to happen.  Five criminals are brought together in a line up and decide to use the events to plan a job.  However another survivor tells an extra story  one involving master criminal Kyser Soze.  Kint reveals how the gang were forced into the fateful job by Soze  however who is Soze and why did the men try to steal what appears to be a ship load of drugs that didn't exist?When I first saw this I saw it in the cinema  the very next day I went back and watched it again.  The plot starts with a cliff hanger and appears to gradually answer the mystery  - however what it actually does is create more questions for every answer it appears to give.  It does this without frustrating you or without confusing the issue  in fact you don't know right till the end that you've been caught in a story teller's web.  The plot unfolds like a normal thriller but it is anything but.The strength of the film is in the writing but it is the direction that also manages to create a great mood.  Singer uses clever shots weaving the story into a believable web of deceit.  The cast add quality to every single line, every single scene.  It's hard to imagine that the film could be the same with any one person changed.Bryne is great as Keaton, his world weary cop drawn into a plan he can't control  or is he the master behind it all.  Spacey gives a great performance as our eyes and ears as he retells the events, he deservedly won an Oscar for this role  before he got all soft and started becoming a starring man.  Baldwin has the film of his life (albeit not hard!), he's really good and should be lucky to get another good role.  Even the minor roles in the gang are great  Del Toro's performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way.  Likewise Pollack will never have a better role  he has genuine tension between him and Baldwin (even in later interviews the dislike still seems real  with things like Pollack telling Baldwin he's sorry that his brothers stole all the food from his table).  Palminteri does a great performance and is totally convincing.  Postlethwaite is good despite playing an Asian (?) lawyer.  Suzi Amis is good in her brief role and Esposito is as good as he always is.Overall I could talk for hours about this film.  It's rare for films now to have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it  it's still twisty and impressive no matter how many times you watch it.",Null,46,66,4 July 2002
Inside Out," Smart, insightful, moving, and fun
","By the time I finally got to see this film, I had already heard lots of praise for it, lots of talking head mulling over whether it has a shot at Best Picture (not just animated), and lots of other things that told me this was supposed to be a great film. Of course, even without this, the film still has the weight of other great Pixar movies down the years, so it already has a high bar to clear even without the additional hype. Watching it for myself though I was surprised by how little I thought of such things, and how totally I just enjoyed the film on its own terms. Ironically, I did this because of how accurate all the positive reviews and buzz were, because Inside Out is a really great film.Constructed on a reality which all parents of older children will no doubt connect to, the film takes the emotional change of a girl into a young teenager and puts it into a comedic adventure story set inside her head. The world inside her head is not only engaging, but incredibly smart – how accurate it is to the real world of psychology (if those words fit together) I do not know, but it is impressively constructed and also designed to make sense, be accessible, and also create a world for colorful characters to delight on an adventure level while also carrying the emotional punch to deliver a much bigger story (although also a very personal one too). It is as moving as it is funny, and as insightful and as it fun, and it is impressive how it is all put together. The animation is topnotch as ever, and the voice cast are not just famous names but well cast famous names who fit their characters well – with Poehler being a strong lead, while Smith, Black, Kaling, and Hader all doing great work (along with many other supporting characters – not least of which being Dias as Riley herself).I doubt voters would be able to bring themselves to vote for it to win Best Picture while being 'just a cartoon' but at the same time it is hard to imagine that 2015 will produce a better, smarter, and more effective film.",Null,5,23,18 December 2015
Die Hard 2," Good action film - but no where near the original
","John McClane is in Washington to meet his wife as she arrives at the airport.  However as he waits for her plane to come in terrorists seize control of the control equipment and keep the planes circling.  They plan to rescue captured dictator General Esperanza by landing his plane at the airport and making their escape.  However as the terrorists wait the circling planes get shorter and shorter on fuel, leading John McClane to take what action he can to regain control of the planes.This second of the exciting die hard series has a hard act to follow.  The first film was amazing and broke the mould relating to action films, it showed that action could occur in everyday locations, caused English actors to get lots of work as bad guys and set many other copycat films in motion (die hard on a mountain, die hard on a bus etc).  However this is nothing special.  The plot tries to be similar to the original but it lacks as much originality as the first.  The terrorist plot is not quite as likely and it doesn't have the same flow as the first.  Story-wise the main flaw is in McClane's involvement - in the first film he was very much trapped and forced to take action, in fact his first instinct was to run away from the terrorists.  Here the same is not true, Willis tries to make it seem that he doesn't want all this again ('how can the same **** happen to the same guy') but really he throws himself into the thick of the battle.  This takes away from the image of him as an ordinary guy put into a difficult situation.The action scenes don't help this problem.  Yes all the action scenes are good and exciting, but many of them are too big.  In the first the action occurred in short standoffs, usually with McClane running away or sneaking around.  Here there's too many of one man v's the world style action with Willis running in against a large number of terrorists and winning.  Again this takes away from the tension and claustrophobia of the other film and makes it feel like a Arnie blockbuster.  That said the action is still good and won't disappoint action fans.The main failing of the film is that it tries to be like the first film without success.  It retains the same set-up (McClane trying to rescue his wife from terrorists), brings back the same Christmas time setting and music, it even wheels back in as many repeat characters as it can (Veljohnson as Sergeant Powell, Atherton as Thornburg) but it loses the most important item - the set parameters of the action.  Die Hard was great because it had very tightly set locations for it's action in the office block.  Here the action can spread out all over so a lot of the tension and claustrophobia is lost.  The decision to make the second film so similar to the first can only lead us to comparing the two and seeing the inferiorities.The performances are quite good generally.  Willis can almost do this type of thing in his sleep while the other repeat characters simply redo their roles.  Unfortunately many of the repeat characters don't have much to do and seem out of place.  The 'new' characters fill the stereotyped shoes of previous actors.  Dennis Franz takes on the mantle of incompetent cop standing in McClane's way by going by the book, Sheila McCarthy takes on the story hungry journalist role etc.  The bad guys do have a lot to live up to by replacing Alan Rickman and they don't quite reach that standard.  William Sadler is good as Colonel Stuart but doesn't have any style of his own, anyway it's good to see Franco Nero (cult star of western Django) in an American film.The film has some nice twists towards the end but it just doesn't come close to the atmosphere of the first film.  By trying to be similar to the first film, Renny Harlin shows that he's not as capable as McTiernan in creating a mood of tension mixed with the action.  The result is a great action movie but one that cowers in the shadow of it's better bigger brother.",Null,6,10,28 November 2001
Flashdance," Memorable images and a few catchy tunes do not a good film make
","Alex works at a steel plant during the day and as an exotic dancer in the evenings to try and make money to get by.  Her ultimate dream though is to get into an exclusive dance school and train to become one of the top ballet dancers.  Even though it seems impossible her boyfriend encourages her and she trains hard and sticks at it to make her dream come true.The reasons why this film was so popular and has remained so well known are bewildering to me.  The film's main selling points are the few catchy tunes (`what a feeling' being the most memorable) and pop music video images, these are the things that have stuck in the mind (and been repeated in other music videos) but the film itself lacks anything of substance whatsoever.The plot is very weak.  Another user compared it to Saturday Night Fever with the genders swapped but that is just unfair, Flashdance has no plot to speak of and, when it does try to act events and depth to the characters it just doesn't work.  Instead it frequently just falls back on dance numbers in the strip club or footage to music of Alex welding or somewhat.  The striptease dances are a total joke - I'm not sure what they were seen as then, but now, when lapdance clubs are the mainstream for men and women, the over-designed things that go on in the club here are just silly and certainly wouldn't draw the club of working men that supposedly pack the place out.Beals is pretty poor apart from looking good semi-dressed.  As a welder she looks so out of place it's funny, and delivering her lines she feels just as unnatural.  I would love to say that she did such a good job dancing but a lot of that was picked up by Marine Jahan (who clearly didn't do enough for a credit!).  None of the rest of the cast make any impression at all - Nouri's boyfriend is bland and all the rest are working class clichés to a man.Overall this film is all style and no substance whatsoever.  Why it was so successful or has remained so well known is a mystery but must be down to a few memorable scenes that stick in the mind and work as music videos rather than anything else.  If you haven't seen this film then what would probably be preferable for you is to track down the video for Jennifer Lopez's `I'm Glad' (she released it on dvd single) - it is basically the film of Flashdance with all the memorable scenes put into a montage for the one song.  It is shorter than the film, sexier than the film and has almost as much substance.",Null,4,8,28 December 2003
Resident Evil," Of course it isn't great, but it does enough to please its intended audience
","The Umbrella Corporation is one of the largest companies in the world; nine out of every ten homes has at least one of their products, usually health-care, medical or otherwise. However their main profits come from military projects and weapons research, with one such facility being The Hive  an underground series of secret labs, employing 500 technicians and controlled by an AI computer called the Red Queen. When the computer detects a viral outbreak in process she seals the Hive and kills everyone. A team are dispatched to find out what happened and shut down the computer; along the way they collect Alice and Spence, sentries to the Hive entrance, who have lost their memories and a cop. They follow their mission but quickly learn that things are not as straightforward as they had planned for.Although I like to think I'm a cinema elitist, I am pretty much a sucker for dumb action movies but when this came out at the cinema I just couldn't bring myself to go and see a video game movie that seemed to be universally slated by the critics. Also, I am easily freaked out by zombie movies and these factors all meant that I didn't bother. With the film coming onto television recently I decided to give it a go and found it to be as weak in certain areas as I had expected but was surprised by the way I actually enjoyed bits of it. The plot is interesting on paper but in reality is used just like a video game  the characters working though each level with some getting picked off on a regular basis. As a story it is no use but it does enough to set up some exciting moments. The film's big corporate edge and sense of foreboding is good at the start but as the film relies on gore and effects it becomes increasingly ineffective right up till the usual big monster at the end.Of course this is not to say that it is a wonderful film, because it isn't. Rather it is a derivative piece of noisy trash that is aimed at teenage boys and those that just like things to go 'bang' regardless of the narrative but, as such, it works, pushing all the right buttons for people who enjoy this sort of stuff. The cast are average at best, thanks in part to the video game direction and lack of interesting lines/characters. Jovovich is usually worth watching and she is a fairly enjoyable action heroine here but she has nothing more to do than that. Likewise the support cast features some solid, gruff performances from Rodriguez and Salmon but the others just about do what is asked of them. The creatures are not that scary, only gory and the direction fails to provide consistent scares; trust me, I'm easily scared by zombie movies and this one failed to do anything for me  especially when they end the film chased by what looks like a mix of bad cgi and rubber.Overall this is not an awful film, just a fairly average one that will only really appeal to its target audience. Outside of teenage boys (and their adult equivalent) the weaknesses here will be too much but for those of us that just want a bit of mindless action without being too demanding will find this watchable if hardly brilliant.",Null,4,11,31 January 2005
Avengers: Endgame," Plot holes and other blockbuster weaknesses, but it is impressive in how well it lands this huge beast in a way that satisfies and delivers
","Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.",Null,6,8,2 June 2019
Dirty Dancing," Relies on cliché, platitudes, easy sentiment and a great soundtrack but it sets out its stall, knows its audience and delivers well
","It was the summer of 1963 when the Houseman's went to Kellerman's resort, where the wealthy enjoy dancing and light entertainment. The dancing is very safe and the Kellerman's youngest daughter 'Baby' is more taken in by the more upbeat and wild dancing that takes place over in the staff quarters (much to the disapproval of Mr Kellerman). When one of the dancers gets 'in trouble', Baby tries to help even though the dancers (particularly Johnny) distrust her motives and dislike her spoilt background. As she learns to dance with Johnny though, Baby wins them over while also growing up in several ways during the summer.A recent Orange 'don't let a phone ruin your movie' skit at UGC featuring Patrick Swayze reminded me that I had never actually gotten round to seeing this film. Strange as it sounds I could tell you the plot and knew it from the music videos and general cultural knowledge but I'd not actually sat and watched it. Well, anyway, I did recently and found a basic but effective film that did just what I expected along fairly predictable lines. For those who hate sentiment this will be a big problem and they should not even bother but for viewers that love this sort of thing or can get caught up in it then it is pretty much spot on. The 'learning to dance' device asks you to accept a bit of a stretch in credibility but generally it is well used to follow Baby as she goes from a teenager into a young woman. It isn't the deepest of affairs and is built on cliché and platitudes at times but generally it has the heart to make it work.Ardolino milks this sense of passion pretty well and delivers the film pretty straight. The cast don't have a lot of depth to work with but they do generally have what it takes to make this sort of material work. Grey was surprisingly subtle with her character and I was quite taken by her deepening  it is not her fault that the script asks her to do a lot quickly. Swayze has a more obvious character but he is sexy and convincing in his character's strengths as well as his weaknesses. Below them nobody is actually that good (although Orbach is a solid presence) but this doesn't matter too much as the central chemistry is what carries the story.Overall then a fairly obvious but effective film that will easily win over fans of the genre. It relies on cliché, platitudes, easy sentiment and a great soundtrack to do this, which does prevent it being deep and realistic enough to win over the sceptics but it sets out its stall, knows its audience and delivers well.",Null,4,10,19 November 2006
Quantum of Solace," Solid & enjoyable even if a lot of it could have been a lot better than it was
","I was looking forward to seeing this film but I'm not sure I was excited to see it. This had been tempered by some average reviews and also some negative ones that suggested that it was simply, not very good as a film - a lot of which have come from ideas over what a Bond film should be. People praised the 'reboot' but apparently QOS is unacceptable? I do not think that the Bond films cannot change it up, but if they tried to do a Bond that was a romantic comedy I would be the first to come to this site complaining about 'what have they done to Bond?' so I'm not totally for change.QOS is not that much of a step away from the Bond tradition and it is just more of an action movie than a Bond movie. Yes I thought it was strange that the traditional opening was saved for the end of the film but the absence of gadgets, innuendo, comedy etc didn't bother me one bit  these were what I hated in Die Another Day in particular. Some have had the issue that QOS follows directly on from the previous film and that the narrative flows directly rather than restarting with a new threat. I liked this though as it cuts away the need to establish everything fresh and instead we get the development of the Quantum organisation - a thread that is good for several more films I suspect. Others have complained that the story made no sense (Kermode in particular went on about how little sense it made) - personally I didn't struggle with the overall flow. The specifics of some scenes or characters perhaps were lost on me, but this was mainly because the film didn't spoon feed me - and I'd rather it made me think. It is not a traditional Bond story though but it worked and those scoffing about the exploitation of one country to make money and get power as a trivial plot by the series standards are not seeing this as a part of a bigger, powerful organisation.Where the 'story' side of the film falls down is in the development of the character as Bond  it could have been any character doing the running and jumping. Don't make me wrong, it is not terrible but the title credits made me hope for more. You see, the names I recognised that made me think something would click were the following - Daniel Craig (arguably the best 'actor' to play Bond), Paul Haggis (Oscar winning writer - and not for action films but for films where story, script and characters were the whole show), Marc Forster (Kite Runner and Monster's Ball - again, more about characters and material than action). I wasn't looking for QOS to be a no-action, all character affair but I did hope that these talents could do great things with the new, darker character of Bond. But they don't. Yes we have the general continuation of this tough, violent man driven by some twisted sort of vengeful love but it makes very little of it. The scenes between the action do well enough to built the story and connect the action but ultimately they are only 'the bits between the action'. The cast are still good - but just feel like more was possible. Craig is a good Bond, rough, fit and attractive with dark menace in his very heart. Amalric may not be a typical Bond super-villain but that was the point. Kurylenko is stunning and fits the modern Bond girl role well. Dench does what she does with quality but Arterton offers nothing but a clumsy Goldfinger reference while Jeffrey Wright's performance suggests an interesting character that the script never produces. Giannini's character produces a moment of emotional and superficial coldness in Bond that is good but otherwise I could have done with him or his character.The action is what the film is about and, while enough to entertain, is never as thrilling or engaging as it should be. This is a problem and it's a problem that Bond struggles to solve - the Bourne problem. I know some people hate rapid editing and tight shots on principle because it causes motion sickness or 'you can't see what's happening' but, done well (as in Bourne) it can draw the audience into action and make it a lot more intense. However, it is not something that happens in the editing room alone. For Bourne this approach compliments and is complimented by the choreography of the action and also the filming style. With Bond it feels at times like this style is an afterthought - some of the action scenes work with it but in the majority it only detracts from the scene. It is still noisy enough to do the job and I do like the brutal edge the scenes have but the editing was not a good call here. Otherwise the action is 'good', great locations, fast cars, big explosions - just a shame that nothing had me on the edge of my seat.QOS is different from the traditional, Christmas-afternoon-telly Bond; but clearing away a lot of clutter doesn't bother me as much as it has some viewers. The film works well as a solid action movie but falls short of being anything special. It is so conscious of Bourne that, in imitating aspects of that film, the makers forget to see if it works with what they are doing. The lack of depth and development in the character is also a disappointment given the talent involved in key areas. It is still a solid and enjoyable film that is worth seeing even if it is hard to ignore that most of it could and should have been better than it is.",Null,17,24,11 November 2008
Independence Day," Big crowd pleaser that takes itself too seriously
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When global telecommunications are disrupted by strange atmospheric occurrences, investigation reveals that they are spaceships positioning themselves around the globe and taking positions above the major cities. As President Whitmore attempts negotiations, cable maintenance man David Levinson spots a signal that appears to be counting down to an attack. When the attack comes, major cities are lost and military response significantly weakened and unable to defend.  When the survivors come together and plan a fight back to defeat the attackers.When this first came out I rushed to see it when it came out and was blown away by the spectacle.  The second viewing (without the hype) revealed a pretty average film with big effects and, seeing it last night, the film doesn't really stand up to much seen years later - even the effects look dated.  The plot is a simple remake of about 100 different sci-fi movies, all the clichés are there and in full effect.  The film is basically in three parts: 1) aliens show up and kick ass, 2) humans wonder what went wrong, mourn and regroup and 3) the humans strike back on the 4th July.Parts one and three both rely heavily on spectacle and, in fairness, it delivers this well - killing millions in grand ways and showing landmarks being destroyed with ease.  The aerial battles are impressive but really just a montage of fast moving dots.  It is unfair to compare apples with oranges - but the attack on Zion in Matrix Revolutions just p*sses on the effects here.  Even without the comparison there is some pretty shoddy blue screen work that must have been hoped would be missed in the middle of all the action.  Aside from that it does mostly look good enough to pass an evening.The plot is, of course, utter nonsense and I won't even waste my time mocking the many, many failures in logic that abound here - it would be like kicking a child.  However suffice to say that the finale is just plain daft and the whole idea of everyone in the world missing the attack signal except a cable guy who was married to one of the President's top people just smacks of very bad and lazy writing.  The writing really is exposed whenever nothing is blowing up.  The script tries to set up basic characters but only in the same way a disaster movie does - basic enough to care vaguely about when they go out in a blaze of supposed emotional glory.  The section without explosions is awful and hard to watch - I couldn't care about characters that the script could barely be bothered to develop past lazy stereotypes and that is just the easy stuff.  Worse than that is the horrible flag waving - lets not kid ourselves, this film is not about us, it's about US.  In other words this is not earth v's the flying saucers but rather America versus the flying saucers.  It is hard not to feel the need to suppress a gag when the President gives his final address to the nation and leads the world to defeat the aliens by following the US's example.Of the cast, none are any good.  Smith does his usual style stuff where he thinks attitude involves saying `yo ass' and `sh*t' as punctuation on his lines.  Goldblum does his usual stuff of being smart and pausing a lot, but he is slumming here.  Pullman plays the President that the US must wish it have - he is such an idealised character that I felt sorry for Pullman having to deliver a role that must have just baffled him in it's simplicity. Hirsch is such a cliché that it's almost offensive, while McDonnell is merely an emotional event rather than a character and Fox, well, she's black right? So lets have her play it with sista attitude - I love her work and it's sad to see her giving such a lazy role.  Quaid is awful, Loggia is OK, Fierstein is horrible, Baldwin is OK and Spiner takes a small step from Data.  Lets be honest - this film is not about the actors, it merely needed some big names to add to the box office draw (and the audience profiling could not be crasser than the casting of Pullman, Smith and Goldblum - so obvious it hurts).Overall this is a big dumb blockbuster that will amuse the audience. However it is way too long and requires you to view without your brain. If you can do this then this is a big dumb sci-fi with more spectacle than anything else.  It's just a major problem that the plot, characters and script are all lazy, crass, basic and unashamedly flag waving to the point that syrup was coming out of my ears.  Vivica Fox looks great in stripper gear though!",Null,14,26,11 January 2004
The Dirty Dozen," Great fun movie with a great cast
","During World War II, Major Reisman is called to a high level meeting to discuss his next mission  to train a group of soldiers and prepare them for a mission behind enemy lines.  However the `soldiers' that Reisman has been assigned are all sentenced to death or life in prison for their crimes.  The mission is a suicide mission on a French chateau where German top brass will be, the aim being to kill as many as possible.  But before the mission, the group must pass a training to be considered for pardoning.Well known by all men everywhere, this is less a serious war movie and more an enjoyable ensemble romp through a training camp, with the final third being the mission itself.  This is the film's strength  the training sections are very enjoyable and good fun to watch.  The mission is punchy and dramatic and works very well as the conclusion to the film rather than the whole film itself (which other `mission' films have to do).  The training is slick and enjoyable, not only it is occasionally quite funny but it is also consistently amusing and exciting at turns.The film's main selling point (increasingly so) is the all star cast, all of whom do really good work.  Marvin is tough in the lead and he is well supported by Borgnine, Kennedy, Ryan and Jaeckel playing the other officers. Of the prisoners Cassavetes steals the show with his cocky Franko although he is not short of famous support.  Sutherland (although not well known at the time) is good comic relief, Savalas is a little too heavy for the film but adds menace, Bronson is good value, Brown is strong and is well known due to a weepy Billy Crystal!  The rest of the dozen give good performances, but I'll be honest and say that the famous faces stuck in my mind more.Overall this is not a wonderful film and, as a war movie it isn't the best `mission' movie you could find (simply cause the mission is quite short and straightforward.  However it is a fun movie that never drags despite the slightly longer than normal running time for this type of movie.  The training section and the mission itself combine to form an enjoyable film that is driven by a great cast playing good characters.",Null,67,99,14 November 2003
Alien vs. Predator," An OK film if you want monsters punching each other, but if you want anything else then you'll be out of luck (SPOILERS - as if it matters)
","When a satellite belonging to the Weyland Corporation picks up a heat trace on a remote island in the Antarctic, investigation reveals it to be some form of pyramid, hundreds of feet under the ice. Putting together a team to go under the ice, Weyland leads a group that includes an ice climber environmentalist, pyramid experts, people who date stuff, drillers and a couple of really big guys with guns. When they come to drill they discover a perfectly formed shaft at 30 degrees going down to the pyramid and take it down as the easy way. However reaching the bottom they quickly get separated by the shifting structure of the pyramid and it is all too late before they realize that they are not alone and may only be a side issue in a bigger story.It is ironic that, in the year that marks the 50th anniversary of Godzilla, I found myself sitting in a multiplex watching two men in monster suits punching each other. The acting may be (marginally) better and the effects cost more but that it basically what this film comes down to, and to enjoy this film it is important you get your head around that as quickly as possible. If you come here expecting plot, acting, scares or quality then you are maybe best to just go somewhere else. But if all you want is two men going 'BOSH' and 'BANG' while wearing monster suits then you've pretty much hit the motherload with AvP. This is not to say that it is any good whatsoever because it really isn't, but if all you want is very basic action then you'll find it passing the time (albeit only a very short 80 minutes). I didn't hate it  and that's about as good as I can say about it.The actual action has no real scares or jumps to it and fails to have anything approaching a palatable tension. The effects are pretty good and some of the fights are alright despite the editor cutting them so quickly that it is hard to really see what is going on. Outside of the spectacle of the film there is really not a great deal else worth turning up for. The plot is delivered by characters who seem to be able to work out what is going on very easily so that they can tell us  if it was me I'd be running shouting 'WTF' but these guys take the time to explain to one another the story. This is clunky and about as annoying as it sounds and it creates a second problem  characterisation. The problem is that there is none. The characters are mainly killed off very quickly and we never really care about them because to us, like to the aliens and predators, they are only incidentals to the main event. Certainly the character of Woods seems to have been intended as a Ripley stand in but having her in a sort of 'mismatched buddy' movie with the Predator failed to get me interested and instead had me trying not to laugh at the whole idea! I must give credit to the writers for at least coming up with a vaguely good concept to make this film happen but beyond this premise the plot is no good at all and the script feels like it was written by someone who had never written a script before  it was a serviceable script but not a convincing one.The cast pretty much know that they are meat and many of them can barely make an impact. The casting is quite interesting because there are only one or two instantly recognisable stars but the majority of them are 'where have I seen him before' faces  eg the guy from James Bond, the guy from Braveheart etc. Lathan tries to be Ripley but fails; the only praise I can give her is she managed to keep a straight face no matter how stupid her scenes were. Bova is OK and is good looking but again has nothing to do. The last time I saw Bremner was a few weeks ago in a short about ME  in fairness maybe stuff like this pays his rent and allows him to do more interesting work but he can certainly do better than this. The rest of the cast are pretty much fodder that last 20 minutes if that, but special bile is reserved for Henriksen who really should have known better. The film didn't need him to tie into the Alien series and, for all he does, he really shouldn't have bothered  he did have some good stuff in other alien films but this was too much. The Predator is OK but has lost the vicious edge that made him compelling in the first film, but the Alien at least is a menacing character (well, apart from the silly lumbering featured in the final scenes).Overall this was not terrible, it was just not any good. Men dressed in suits throw each other around and CGI effects gallop up walls in the dark while things go bang. If that is all you want then this film just about manages to deliver that in a very basic fashion. But if you are looking for plot, dialogue, characters, genuine excitement or tension then you might as well just p1ss off home now because there ain't none of that here for you! How cheering it is though, to see that 50 years after Japan started the ball rolling, Hollywood is keeping up tradition of poor movies based solely on the idea of two men in rubber suits throwing each other around a set. And they say there are no original ideas left...",Null,4,10,2 November 2004
No Country for Old Men," Meditative yet tense, funny yet terrifying (SPOILERS)
","While tracking a wounded animal to finish it off, Llewelyn Moss comes across the aftermath of a bloody shootout, seemingly of a drug deal gone terribly wrong. The drugs are still there but everyone is dead apart from one man who will be soon. Llewelyn finds the money and an attempted get-away only a few ridges away and keeps it. Later that night his conscience gets the better of him and he returns to check on the dying man. Unfortunately he is too late but this time he is noticed by those also looking for the money and he flees, leaving his truck behind. Knowing this will lead the criminals to him, Llewelyn packs his wife off to her mother's and he sets off with the money. Following in his wake however is an man sent to recover the money, Anton Chigurh, for whom 'evil' is much more than a concept. Far behind both of them is aging sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who can only wonder at the daily violent outrages he has to witness.Many others have already said it so I can only echo when I say that this is a real return to form for the Cohen brothers after a handful of amusing but yet not that good films including The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty and so on. In something of a marriage made in heaven, the Cohens and author Cormac McCarthy have produced a great film out of what simply could have been a 'everyman dragged into job gone wrong' thriller if it had been given to anyone else. It is impressive how they still work within this genre and produce more than expected while also still working effectively in the areas one would expect such a film to do. I have listened to those who claim it was boring and far too slow and I am afraid I just cannot really understand the point of view  far less agree with it. Likewise I have watched those leaving the cinema ten minutes from the end, I can only assume because with Llewelyn dead then the 'plot' is closed for them and they might as well beat the traffic.On the contrary, for me this film worked across so many levels that I cannot imagine leaving at any moment other than the end, and even then the film will stay around for longer than that. The slow pace never feels anything other than appropriate as it is either doing or of two things, or both. The opening and closing scenes are a fine example of how meditative it all is and this suits the pace. The film is thoughtful on the subject of violence and evil, with the title and the material questioning whether things are worse or just different (cleverly it is also set in the eighties). I found this fascinating even if I didn't understand all of it. Working alongside this is the constant tension associated with the main plot. It is unbearably tense at times and the slow pace only serves to heighten this and make the moments of sudden violence all the more impacting. With these two things working so well together I really had zero issue with the slow pace.The Cohen's delivery is note perfect throughout with the characters and places being just that little bit quirky but not to the point where the violence or menace is affected in the slightest. They pace the material and perfectly balance the gripping with the thoughtful. I particularly liked the way that they handled scenes of violence  while thrilling, the viewer is never 'pumped up' by them or excited but rather sickened or just plain deadened. It suits the material again and somehow seeing the casual aftermath of, for example, Carla's death, is so much more meaningful than seeing it occur. The cast respond well to this direction and turn in solid performances across the board. Brolin (who suddenly seems to be in everything) is a firm 'everyman' character who we root for but not to the point where we lose the other two main characters. Jones is perfectly still and reflective and his 'good ol' boy' mannerisms are underlain with an increasing sense of bewilderment and frustration that makes his scenes work so much better  which was important. The most impacting turn comes from Bardem, who simply personifies evil with a performance that made me want to edge away from him, far less the other characters. His scenes sparkle with menace and he represents everything that Jones' character worries over  even a simple scene in a garage is gripping due to his delivery and simple logic. Trainspotting's Macdonald gives a great performance and a great accent in her role, with a great scene late on. As per Cohen tradition, the smaller characters are amusingly quirky and fit the Texan world of small towns, with motel owners and so on all amusing in their (often fatal) interactions with the main players. Special mention for Harrelson who is so-so for much of it but is utterly convincing when he finds himself totally out of his depth in this world he tried to be in (his offer of $14k as telling as his reddening skin and panicked eyes).At the end the tone is downbeat but for me it is fitting as we close as we opened, on a meditative slant, sending the audience away thinking. It is a quite remarkable film that manages to be thoughtful but yet unrelentingly tense producing quirky amusement in some scenes but never at the expense of the impact of the violence, which is terrifying offhand at times. No Country for Old Men stands above the recent output from the Cohen's and easily stands alongside their greatest work such as Blood Simple, Fargo and so on.",Null,8,14,17 February 2008
The Love Guru," A star-studded, unfunny, embarrassing shambles
","When his wife left him for a particularly well-endowed rival, the Maple Leafs star hockey player Darren Roanoke's winning ways turn to rubbish and the team starts to suffer. Young and unpopular owner Jane Bullard turns to a relationship guru for help in fixing the problems that seem to be doing the harm. Guru Pitka takes the job with the aim of becoming the #1 guru in the country and claiming his rightful spot on the Oprah Winfrey Show, however the road to a solution where matters of the heart are involved are never straightforward.You can sort of see what Myers was doing with his character because in a very, very broad sense there is some comedy to be had from taking the mick out of modern self-help experts with their slogans and trademarks. This is me being generous though because this potential doesn't even come close to being translated into being a good film. The plot of the film is just an excuse for a patchwork quilt of poor 'comedy' moments and famous faces that are never actually that funny. That is the problem because any comedy can get over plotting issues if the audience is laughing most of the time, but rest assured you will not be here. The script is full of lazy gags, juvenile humour and basic mugging from all involved. A lot of the blame is on Meyers of course and in fairness to debut director Schnabel (who's limited resume on IMDb shows him coming up thanks partly to Meyers) but he was not going to take on 'star' Meyers and say 'you know what  this just isn't working'.The truth is though that somebody needs to because Meyers easy mugging is just lazy and unfunny, with a routine that once was fresh is now just lots of face pulling and 'pee-pee' jokes. He seems totally unaware of this because he includes a musical reference to Wayne's World thinking it will be a funny in-joke as opposed to a sad reminder of when he was funny. What is truly mystifying though is why so many stars are involved. Alba is moving past the 'starlet of today' stage and needs to get established before the next pretty young thing comes alone  she has done this well recently with award show hosting etc as well as solidly performing films but she REALLY needs to consider what her agent is doing to her  Good Luck Chuck was a job for a starlet and, while I understand from the names involved the Love Guru looked more attractive, reading the script should have been a clue. She tries to be light and funny but the film doesn't deserve her efforts. I can only assume that Timberlake did this because he wanted everyone to see that Southland Tales was not a failure because THIS is what a failure looks like. He tries and throws himself into a ridiculous accent and character that would have been great if it wasn't so silly. Troyer does his usual stuff yet again but far more excruciating is a terrible turn from Sir Kingsley who I can only assume really does need the money that badly or has completely lost any sense of judgement  his performance is pulling an cross-eyed face. End of story. Simpson, Kilmer, West and others line up to show their famous faces but what is more disappointing is to see two very funny and very clever men (Oliver and Colbert) taking part in this, although to his credit Colbert is one of the few slightly funny things in here.So I'm saying what everyone has already said, but I gave up 90 minutes for this thing so I think I've earned my say! I'm not sure how Meyers can turn it around but certainly having free reign and seemingly thinking that just turning up, pulling faces and kicking a midget in the groin will do it has not helped him. Not sure why nobody told him what a mess this is or why so many people were willing to take part but ultimately what we the audience are left with is an unfunny shambles of a comedy that is silly but never actually funny. I have no issue with silly films but I do when they are unfunny, lazy and frankly an embarrassment for most of those involved.",Null,1,6,11 September 2008
District 9," Not as insightful or intelligent as some claim but makes for an entertaining summer blockbuster
","There is a tendency for critics to do things to extremes. If you watch enough films you will find that, like most things, there is a massive quality bell-curve with the vast majority falling into the middle 'it was OK' section of that curve. When big blockbuster films shift one way or the other in that spectrum critics take the opportunity to put the boot into it or lavish it with praise depending on which side it is on, making it seem like it is further to the end of the scale than it is. This should be kept in mind when coming to District 9 because while it is a very good film indeed, it is still a blockbuster sci-fi with all the action, plot holes and noise that they come with.It is built on an interesting idea though, with political parallels and a setting that is for once not a major US city with landmarks and it does make it more intriguing and interesting than the obvious comparison of the summer which is the pointless Transformers 2. However this is not the same as saying it is as insightful or intelligent as some have claimed. Like the short film that I watched a few years ago, the metaphor is not really worked with as a subject but rather used as a base. There is nothing wrong with this but let's not pretend that the film is this wonderfully clever allegory that makes for the most intelligent subtext and discussion that we have ever seen – it most certainly does not.What it does do though is provide more in the way of involvement in the focused story that makes up the film. This is the story of Wikus joining with one of the Prawns to try to save himself and, along the way, seeing them on a moral level for the first time. It is not earth-shatteringly insightful but it is smart and it makes of a good base for a thriller/action plot that delivers for everyone. Amazingly made for $30 million this film has a great look and everything looks 'real' like it is really in the shot - unlike the technically impressive effects of Transformers. Like Empire Magazine said, Michael Bay has dreams that cost more than $30million! There isn't really a bit 'money shot' here and indeed it is easy not to be impressed by the effects simply because they don't feel like CGI in the way too many action films these days impress technically but don't grip. It is surprisingly graphic for the rating but it is not unpleasantly violent because the characters are engaging enough and the action thrilling enough for you to be carried along rather than focus on the gore.The film is delivered in a range of ways. It starts out as a documentary looking back but then starts to throw in dramatic scenes where no camera would have been there, before giving up on the idea and going dramatic with only bits of news footage etc thrown in to provide another camera angle and add to the realism of the scene (the action sequences at the end). This is not as jarring as some would suggest and, while it does feel a bit odd, it does mostly work because I don't think it has to be 'one thing' throughout the film. What works particularly well are the performances – or rather the lead one. Copley is not an actor but yet he is able to improvise a character that is convincing as a dorky bureaucrat and as a man fighting for survival. He isn't dropping one-liners and he doesn't have a total change from his 'anti-prawn' views during the majority of the film but yet he feels very real and not like someone giving a good performance. Likewise the Prawns feel real on the screen and the effects are more than good enough to allow convincing interaction with the human actors and also make them be characters rather than effects. This doesn't extend much further than that though and the head of MNU, the head mercenary and the head gangster are all fairly obvious pantomime villains – although to be fair this is what is required of them and they produce the thriller aspect. Speaking of the gangsters I will say that, while not a massive problem, it is a shame that Nigerians are portrayed 100% as they are in this film – it would have been just as easy to have a criminal gang in the role of criminal gang, there is no narrative reason for them being Nigerian in particular.District 9 is a great summer blockbuster. Like the short film it builds on a base of an interesting idea to deliver effects and thrills that are amazing considering the (comparative) shoestring budget. It isn't as smart or as insightful as some have said but the film never claims to be and it is just the critics and those expecting something that isn't there that have said this. Engaging and thrilling with an engagingly interesting idea at its core, this is well worth seeing and I hope that the sequel will be as good (which will surely happen as the numbers more than make sense – which is normally all that matters).",Null,12,24,15 September 2009
Mamma Mia!," If you think you'll love/hate it then you probably will  for the same reasons as those that feel the opposite way
","The critical and audience reactions to this film seemed to suggest that it was very much a Marmite of a film, with people either loving it or hating it. By the time I thought I should check it out, the 'biggest film of the year' had become a sing-a-long classic and I decided to wait for the DVD. Watching it myself I can totally understand why this reaction was forthcoming and it is not really down to the film so much as it is the viewers. See, those that hate it will do so for the same reasons as those that love it. Mamma Mia is a film version of a stage-show but it is not an adaptation in that it has been made into a film so much as it is a stage musical made into a film. What I mean by this clunky sentence is that all the standards of the cheesy musical have been left in  from 'big' action, colour and simple dumb cheer.For me personally this doesn't really appeal and nor did I particularly enjoy the film as it did feel all forced smiles and joys, scenes shoe-horned to fit the lyrics and fake fun in the actors and extras. By the end I had pretty much had as much camp fun as I could really stand and was glad it was done. Now others have taken that to mean that the film is rubbish, but it isn't  it just didn't work for you either. However for what it does Mamma Mia is actually very good because it knows who it is aiming for and what it has to do. Yes this means that it is daft and cheesy but that sort of 'big' cheerfulness is what the target audience want  they want to feel elated and lifted even if it isn't real in any form. In that regard the film delivers as it is built on beautiful colours in the sets and costumes and a cast that put their egos to one side and throw themselves into it.This last part is important because to my disinterested eye all the star actors came off looking daft. Streep is certainly not someone I expected to be doing this and to her credit she throws herself into it, showing a camp overacting side I didn't know she had. Likewise Walters, Baranski, Firth, Brosnan and Skarsgård all do much the same  albeit to varying degrees of success. If you're into it then the 'big' performances are all part of the fun but if, like me, you're not, then it will be endlessly embarrassing and it will be hard to shake the feeling that I was watching award-winning actors making themselves look and sound like muppets. Of course that is why they are 'good' in the context of what the film is trying to be and yet at the same time 'bad' if you are not in the swing of the film.What we are left with then is a film that we have seen plays really well to those that get it but leaves everyone else wondering why on earth people like Streep and Walters would make such nonsense. I personally disliked it but that does not make it a 'bad' film, only a bad one from my point of view. For what it sets out to do though, it is a winning achievement  full of cheerful cheese and lots of colour. In fact, it is such a targeted film that you will already know whether you will love it or hate it long before you press play.",Null,14,17,18 November 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Improves upon the first one just about enough to cover the weaknesses it shares with it
","After seeing the first Hobbit film I must admit that I could have cared less about seeing the second and indeed it took me a minute to get back into it and I was grateful for the film giving me a '12 months earlier' scene to sum up what I am supposed to be following. It wasn't that the first film was bad (it is too expensive to be bad) but more than constant action and movement with no consequences or realism to engage me, really left me looking at a video game that I had no investment in (and I say this as a gamer). I didn't hope for much better when I went to see this sequel and, as Theo Robertson has said, perhaps this helped me enjoy the Desolation of Smaug more.The plot has more to it than one encounter after another and connecting it to the later films was a good move that made me feel there was more content here – although I think that was artificial, I will not deny that it worked. The action sequences retain the same problems as the first film, which is that nobody ever feels like they are in real danger no matter how long the fall, how low the odds or what is happening. The good thing is that because the film isn't one escape sequence after another, I didn't feel this so often – although it is undeniably still a problem in these films. The characters were a little better than before although perhaps I was just more interested in them. Smaug in particular is a great creation – visually and stylishly; just like the first film where my favorite parts were the still and tense sequences with Gollum, so too here the high point of the whole film is where Smaug is toying with his potential victims and it is such a shame that this was not done longer.Visually the film remains a feast – although, befitting the time of year, it is a Christmas feast where everything is good but it is endless and eventually just feels indulgent and gluttonous. This remains the case because the film almost never feels like it was shot wholly on a location. I remember the LotR films impressing me with their natural beauty but here even a shot of people walking across a field seems to have been digitally enhanced and, as good as it looks, it does remove me from the film somewhat. Visual effects are impressive but it does really hurt to see Jackson leaning towards the George Lucas 'if we can do it then we should do it' school of effects management. The cast do solid jobs – I liked Freeman and McKellan when they were allowed to be more than just special effects The dwarfs made more of an impression on me this time but the elves not so much – Bloom remains stiff while Lilly sports the only unconvincing effect in the film in the shape of her ears. Cumberbatch was strong as the voice of Smaug and I enjoyed Fry and McCoy in supporting roles (shame the latter missed out on more time due to his Doctor Who efforts during the 50th anniversary year!).The Desolation of Smaug is a solid blockbuster; lots of action, a decent story and strong special effects – this is not the same as saying it is a great film though, but it does still entertain. The story remain distant due to the invincible characters and consequence free (but very seriously presented) action, which does prevent one being drawn into it. Of course I'll be there for the final film, but I really do hope than they focus on danger rather than spectacle and build the tension instead of just increasing the noise.",Null,99,144,28 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Beautifully filmed and haunting film that is classy, deliberate and engaging
","Robert Ford is an unremarkable and unmemorable young man who has long held a fascination with the outlaw Jesse James. When his attempts to join the James gang are rejected, Ford persists and is taken in by Jesse  perhaps because the latter welcomes the non-threatening adoration of the former. However as time goes on two things occur within both men  Ford becomes disillusioned and less in awe of Jesse, while Jesse becomes suspicious of his gang members and fearful of betrayal.It is best to get the common complaint out of the way and acknowledge that, in some vocabularies, this film is 'slow' but this is not the same as me agreeing with those that label it such. Rather I prefer to see it as 'deliberate' or 'gradual' because these describe the quality of pace in the same way but doesn't suggest that it is a detrimental or negative thing. So the film does move with a patient pace that is in no rush to go anywhere quickly. But yet it manages to engage and hold the attention with surprising ease. The reason is the quality in the tale  the narrative, the characters and the themes all come together to produce a film of quiet interest.I am not doing it justice in my description but the main story, taken at face value is an engaging story of the later life and fate of Jesse James, in particular his interactions with Robert Ford. It is a fascinating portrayal mainly because of the strength of the characters more than the specifics of the plot. James is as charming as he is violent and it this uneasy balance that makes him engaging. Meanwhile Ford goes from being starry-eyed to being bitter; both men are interesting individually and together. As many have said, the modern subject of fame is run through the film. The wonderful title alludes to it as it presents the story in the headline of spin (history may side with the celebrity against the 'coward' but we can see that the title is not necessarily true). Mostly it is in the background but in retrospect it is more important than I first thought  it just took the final twenty minutes to bring it all into focus for me in regards significance.Bringing the best from the characters are a couple of great performances, supported by good performances. The celebrity undercurrent very much suits the casting of Pitt but it is not just this that he brings to the role. Rather his performance is really impressive, mixing his usual charisma and charm with a convincing undercurrent of menace. Affleck was more of a surprise to me because he does come out with a nicely understated and powerful character that rightly never gets close to holding a scene in the way Pitt's James has to, but does all his work in smaller ways. The support has good work from Parker, Rockwell, Shepard and others. Dominik directs the camera and the cast with a steady and understanding hand but for me the real star is Roger Deakin, who's main misfortune appears to have been having two great products in the same Oscars season  essentially splitting his votes.The cinematography is breath-taking. The most obvious touches of style get the mentions of course, but across the whole film it looks great, with attention paid to the stark colours, strong use of lighting and focal points within the shots. Like everyone else though it is the wonderfully creative visual moments that make the film and stick with the viewer. The striking use of light and darkness in the early train robbery is one but the general design of the narrator-led sequences with clever use of focus, framing and colour. It is a breath-taking work and although I cannot comment on its worthiness versus 'There Will Be Blood' (I have not yet seen it), it is a triumph. It is rare that I would watch a film again just for the beauty of it, but this is one of those films that could have frames and sequences hung in a gallery.Like its title this film is longer than the norm, but it is also better than the norm as well. The pace is slow, but not in a way that is dull but rather a way that is patience and rewarding. The story and characters hold the attention easily and the thematic comment on fame only serves to add. Topping off the performances and direction is a wonderful piece of work from the cinematographer that greatly adds to the sense of importance of the film by making each scene a visual beauty that is a joy to watch. I get that it will not be to everyone's tastes but it deserves to be seen anyway  but moaning that it doesn't have the pace of Young Guns says more about you than the film.",Null,4,7,22 May 2008
Tigerland," Not exactly original but an engaging drama based on real life experience, gritty atmosphere and some good performances
","Tiger Land is a tough training camp for the US military.  In 1971 it is the final step before the squads go to the war in Vietnam.  In training before Tiger Land, one squad of young men is joined by troublemaker Roland Bozz, who continues his military trend of dissention and insubordination. However, his actions do not just affect him and he starts to change his ways slightly, but the stresses and the potential for death in Vietnam push all the men to breaking point.Sold as a war movie, this film is more like the first half of Full Metal Jacket than a full on war movie set in a combat zone.  As such it plays more like a drama than any sort of antiwar movie or outright thriller.  The focus of the film is the character of Bozz as told from the biographical point of view of Paxton.  The events of the film are pretty predictable for anyone who has seen this type of film before - the internal fights, the crazy soldiers, the domineering sergeant majors etc.  However it still manages to be enjoyable and entertaining even if it never really feels original or new. It is a pretty nondescript film with no specific edge on it - and that is part of the reason I think it really didn't do that good business when it was released here in the UK.  It relies very heavily on the characters to keep the audience involved in the story and preventing it being seen as just a collection of old ideas; this aspect is helped by the fact that it is drawing on original material, experiences and people.A much bigger part of the characters being engaging is the playing of them by the cast.  Farrell is the lead actor and is miles ahead of everyone else. This film is one of many that made him the star he now is, and he does deserve it off the back of this and he is really good here - coming across as likeable and difficult.  Outside of him, everyone plays well but are generally in their various stereotypes; aside from Farrell, Collins is the standout role - too often seen playing gang bangers and such on TV cops shows, he delivers a solid character and presents a believable breakdown over the course of the film.Keeping my habit of never paying to see an Schumacher film since Batman & Robin took the last faith in his talent, I waited for this to come onto TV. I was surprised however to see that Schumacher managed to do the film without spoiling it - in fact he came across as rather able!  He uses mainly handheld cameras and delivers a gritty feel to the whole film that is fitting to the material.  I hate to admit it, but he actually did a reasonable job here and he has now done a couple of films that he hasn't ruined in one way or another!  I may have to change my mind about not paying for his films - well, maybe not.Overall this is a rather undistinguished film but one that is enjoyable as a character driven drama, trading on the usual clichés of the genre.  It goes where you more or less expect it to but it goes there and takes you with it. Farrell makes a good leading man and on this evidence he is worthy of leading man status where he has good support.",Null,37,46,13 March 2004
Days of Thunder," Painting by numbers produces an average film despite the cast
","Eager for a winning formula, team owner Tim Daland puts together the inexperienced but naturally talented Cole Trickle and the retired but skilled mechanic Harry Hogge to hopefully bounce off each other to create a winning combination. After the expected bumps and friction between the two, they seem to blend well and start winning races. However, a major accident between Cole and his main rival, Rowdy Burns, puts them both in the hospital under the care of the professional and leggy Dr Lewicki. But will Cole be able to overcome the physical and mental scars that he got.The comedian Rich Hall did a great routine once where he summed up the films of Tom Cruise by basically saying that each of them involves him being great at his job (pilot, bartender, driver) before suffering a crisis of confidence but meeting a beautiful lady who helps him over it in time to come good  hilarious in the telling because he was right and, true to form, Days of Thunder sets its stall out in the same way. That the plot is formulaic (father/son stuff, macho posturing, love interest, final big race etc) and it is a bit tiring at times because it is nothing new and it produces large sags during the film. The father/son stuff is OK if hackneyed but the romance is so sudden and fake that it left me cool and never engaged once. The racing stuff is fun, noisy and fast which I suppose is what most of its audience want; but this is still not a great action movie but kudos to Scott for managing to make a load of cars going round a circular track appear exciting.The cast is more impressive on paper than they are in reality. Cruise plays his usual character and does it with no real charm or ability. He is trading off his fame here and his macho nonsense is rather tiresome. Kidman may have been Cruise's offscreen partner but viewers of this film will have seen their divorce coming because they have zero chemistry and she is poor throughout. It's not all her fault though, the script gives her nothing to work with. Thank god then, for Robert Duvall; he may be playing a fairly clichéd character but he does it well and steals every scene from his pretty but empty co-star. Support is good from Quaid and Rooker but Ewles is given too little time to make anything but a negative impression and Reilly had yet to prove his versatility and doesn't do it here.Overall this is very much painting by the numbers in many regards. The plot is easy and lacks any sort of spark or innovation meaning that, when the cars are off the screen, it is easy for the film to get dull. The action scenes are OK but, as with F1, I find many motor sports to be dull and didn't get drawn into the predictable races as much as I wanted to. The script gives the cast nothing to really work with, and only Duvall comes out with any real dignity even if he has a cliché as opposed to a real person to play. This has all the failings you would expect and the end result of so little imagination is an average film that is watchable but no more than that.",Null,19,41,23 August 2004
Remember the Titans," Quite enjoyable even if it is corny and rather derivative
","When segregation comes to an end TC Williams High School is created by the combination of an all-black school with an all-white school and, for political reasons, the white head coach Bill Yoast is replaced by black coach Herman Boone. This obviously causes a lot of conflict within he team and it is only to protect his white players that Yoast decides to stay on as the defensive coach. When the players go to training camp the conflicts are everywhere and Boone's first job is to bring the team together.Usually when movie premieres come onto terrestrial television they are trailed big time and are put in plum spots; so when this film was simply dumped into the daytime schedules at Christmas time I feared the worst and, for that reason, didn't get round to watching it until February. As with many films, there is plenty of good in it but it is dented a bit by its weaknesses. As you would expect it to be, this is a simple story of race conflict being resolved within a group of youths who then become a winning team and, in the telling, it doesn't do anything out of the ordinary. Now that is not to look down on the real story behind the film but the film itself cannot help but spoil it by always going for the easy clichés, the simple and corny bonding moments that summarise a difficult journey and, whenever possible, sticking in some mighty, swelling music to make sure we all understand how emotional that particular moment is.What this does is reduces the true story of a turbulent time to the level of melodrama and, while I admit it would have been hard to do it any other way, it cannot help but damage the film a little. However despite this it is still quite enjoyable and those that can forgive its self-indulgence will find much to like about it. However for me it was hard to get past the corn and I was only able to see an average sports movie with a core of a 'lets understand each other' storyline. The sports stuff is OK but never gripping and the characters are a touch too generic to be really involving. It is fortunate then that the performances are mainly reasonably good, certain good enough to keep the film lively and watchable. Washington delivers a good performance even if it lacks any subtlety or edge to it; likewise Patton is right out of the playbook and does what is expected of him. The support cast have some good performances and some corny performances but generally they all do well enough to match the tone of the film.Overall this is an OK film that is quite enjoyable but doesn't do anything special. While having enough to involve and just about entertain, the film still suffers from being overly melodramatic, corny and loaded with moments that come across as rather clichéd. If you can accept this then it is a good film, otherwise it is just an OK one that will grate on you occasionally.",Null,2,4,13 February 2005
Batman Begins," A great summer blockbuster  dark, interesting, exciting and more than an antidote to Schumacher's childish vision of the character
","Bruce Wayne is not a happy fella. Being trapped in a cave full of bats as a child left him full of fear, and he can only blame himself for the death of his parents at the hands of a typical street thug. However time has perverted this hurt into a bitter, hollow anger that has led him to the Far East where he fights criminals behind bars, seemingly to seek to quench his thirst for what he sees as 'justice'. Taken into a remote training facility for the League of Shadows by Ducard, Wayne learns the arts of deception, movement, combat and others but when he understands that justice is death for this group he leaves and returns to Gotham City. In his absence, the city has fallen into corruption and crime and, seeking a symbol of fear for the criminals, Wayne uses his skills and considerable assets to try and bring down this rule by way of a vigilante personae  The Batman. However, with few allies in this fight, will he be able to counter more than the smaller fish in the pond?Although I don't agree with those IMDb users who have put this film into the top 250 ever made, I do see why they did it, because after the decreasing returns of the modern Batman films I was almost relieved that Begins made a massive leap away from the childish mess that Joel Schumacher had produced. Although not perfect, Nolan's Batman is dark where Schumacher's was day-glow; interesting where the other was puerile; exciting where the other was tiresome; this Wayne is a person where the other's was a child's action figure; this film almost stays in the real world where the other was set in some fantasy world that Schumacher must see when he shuts his eyes. So I can see why people love this film so much  it is such a massive jump up in quality that it is easy to see it as the greatest film ever made; compared to Batman & Robin this IS Citizen Kane. The plot sounds silly at the start but the structure of flashbacks and desolate reality make you forget of the lack of logic (or even explanation) behind Wayne being in prison. From here the training is swift and exciting while more cuts give us the back-story we already know. Back in Gotham Batman truly begins and the build up is as good as the delivery  he is not full of quips, in fact at first he is barely seen. While building the usual 'baddie with a big weapon' story the film blends characters, other baddies, themes and action so naturally that it makes it look easy  but Schumacher will assure you it is not.Nolan's direction and the design of the film are big reasons for it working; although the material is fantastic, somehow it all feels like the real world and not like B&R for example. It feels gritty and it makes the characters more real and therefore interesting. Also appreciated is the fact that it is not only dark in visuals but also content. Personally I would have liked Wayne to have been more twisted and confused but what it did was good enough, more important though was how scary bits were  the Scarecrow, the paranoid visions, all combined to produce some dark images. Oh, and many thanks to the genius parents who saw this film advertised and thought 'hmm, a darker Batman film with a rating for over 12's  I know, I'll take my 4 year old to see that'; needless to say several families in my screening will not be aware of the ending of the film  who'd have though a 12A would frighten pre-school children? Tossers.The cast do well with what they have. Bale is a great Batman and I struggled to reconcile the man I saw with the man I saw a few months back in The Machinist. Although the script only gives him basic emotional building blocks and not a real inner struggle, Bale still does well with it and far from being the straightman to Batman's entertainer, his Wayne is the most interesting thing in the film. Neeson makes for a good trainer and his darkly interesting character does enough so that we accept the mythical body he represents. Holmes is OK, pretty good but really I could have coped without her character. Caine is a great choice for Albert and he seems to enjoy it. Freeman may have just followed the Alec Guinness model of taking the payday but he is also enjoyable Q to Bale's Bond (bet they wish their franchise had gotten him first). Murphy is interestingly creepy even before he becomes genuinely scary as his villain. Oldman does less than he is capable of but he is still a good addition  ditto with Wilkinson.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is a great summer movie and, more importantly, it is a massive improvement on the Batman that Schumacher gave us  everything that it failed to do, this does well. A worthy blockbuster that is engaging, dark, exciting, scary and fun  well worth seeing and probably one of the better blockbusters this year.",Null,15,25,16 July 2005
Twilight," Bland and surprisingly lacking in passion, excitement or breathlessness
","There is no point in pretending it – I'm a man in his thirties and I'm not target audience for this film. So the fact that I rented it is just a 'bonus' few pounds in the pockets of the makers since they clearly weren't aiming this film at me. Who they were aiming it at appears to have been the army of teenage girls who have been reading the Twilight books religiously – again. I'd never even heard of the books so this is really something off my cultural radar. Regardless I decided to give the film a try without really knowing the plot or what it was meant to be. What I found was the first part in a longer story about a human teenager who moves back to her small town and falls for a boy who turns out to be one of a group of teenage vampires who feed off the blood of animals rather than people.I have no problems with the teenage aspect of the story but somehow it really failed to engage me as it was not only too superficial but didn't even really do that particularly well. The film plays like it has been written around events without a great deal of depth, complexity or characterisation in it, which is a surprise considering the fertile ground the world of teenage love and acceptance is. Sadly it comes off all too bland and obvious for my tastes and I rarely could bring myself to care about what was going on. The direction is a bit too serious at times but it also lacks passion and the breathlessness that the material suggests it must have once had if it did captivate a teenage audience. Of course I could be just missing the point because perhaps the cast are a big part of it working and this is lost on me.Certainly the appeal of much of the cast is lost on me totally. Stewart has something about her but cannot translate it into something meaningful here, leaving her character feeling a bit one-dimensional. However compared to Pattinson she looks like one of the finest actresses of her generation because he is about as dull and vapid as he could have been without trying. OK maybe his immortal, unsleeping character has to have something weirdly 'dead' about him but this should not be a detrimental part of his performance as it is here. I shan't bother to list those below them because nobody really captured my interest in terms of their characters or performances.Twilight is not a bad film, it is just a very bland one that lacks passion, heart or excitement. Maybe the target audience will strongly disagree (I'd be shocked if they did not) but having watched this for myself I fail to see what not only the fuss is about – but why anyone would really consider this to be a good film.",Null,19,160,13 July 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," Retro-cool points for sure, but needed more laughs and more heart
","'It's the new Pixar film' I said to my partner, as we sat to watch this film recently, although it didn't take me long to realize that while Disney may own Pixar now, this isn't to say that they can suddenly produce films that have made that studio so very successful. Wreck-It Ralph has the high-concept idea and shades of Toy Story in its 'alive when the lights go out' motif, but it is disappointingly light in most things after this has settled in. The plot sees a villain in a video game setting out to be a good guy in other games so that he can return home with a prize to prove it and thus be accepted by his fellow characters.On the face of it the film has the potential to be emotional, moving and funny and you can see that it is aiming for the Pixar mould, but it just gets lost in its own plotting and forgets to do the key things well. There is a lot going on here – villains, glitches, a quest for a medal, a quest for a race, a quest to get Ralph back etc etc. All of the plotting takes time and offers little in return. The key thing for me though is that it simply isn't funny or fun enough; it has a few chuckles but nothing more than that. The characters and the jokes are pretty obvious – even the casting is easy to predict (for example the big joke around Sarah Silverman and McBrayer is that they are the characters we already know them to be in adult world). It is an adventure and will distract kids, but the laughs are too far between. The cool points are there from the start though – the 8-bit graphics, the gamer in-jokes and references, but they mostly aren't clever so much as just done and this gets old quite quickly. It is a film badly in need of genuine heart and warmth but this never comes either; we get sentimentality and moments like this but nothing real or actually moving.This is across the story, across the characters and across the jokes. It still gets cool points and it still has its moments but it is disappointingly lacking in wit and heart, leaving a lot of noise and adventure but nothing more than that. Worth a look but it doesn't even get close to the Pixar films that represent the high water mark to which it clearly aspires.",Null,2,4,17 February 2013
To Rome With Love," Fragmented and disappointing
","I recently watched Midnight in Paris and really enjoyed the light whimsy of it and how effective it was, so as a result I continued to watch To Rome with Love – the most recent of Allen's films to be greeting with cries of 'return to form' only for the film to generally be less well received soon afterwards. I had hoped this impression would not be the reality in the way Paris wasn't, but sadly it was. The film opens in busy Rome with many people coming and going and plenty of stories – a young married couple gets separated, two sets of parents come together to meet each other but inadvertently change the career path of both, an older man walks the streets and finds a younger man whose situation he recognizes and a perfectly normal man suddenly finds himself the focus of an adoring press.Amongst all these ideas are some nice ones and some less so ones. The film runs long (for Allen) trying to fit them in and it gives the whole film the feel of a fragmented sketch show where no one thing is done well enough to carry the weaker moments. I did enjoy aspects of most sections but generally I found myself underwhelmed with how they were delivered. The older man/younger man thread is a nice one but it seems stiff and lacking spark and inspiration. Allen himself as actor overdoes it and seems out of place a little – which is a shame to see, but the rest of the cast are mixed. Some are natural, some are 'acting', some are fun and some are not. It is a very mixed bag and again one that doesn't totally come together. Visually it is very appealing but I found the style a little bit fake and forced – perhaps I felt this as I have only been to Italy a handful of times and maybe don't have the same experience I do in France? Don't know but for some reason I didn't find too much of it to be charming which I guess was the hope.A shame; forgiving Allen fans will find some enjoyment in it, and it is not without its good aspects, but generally I found it fragmented and disappointing, lacking the charm it really needed to have.",Null,2,5,16 November 2013
Bridesmaids," Delivers the laughs but remembers to keep the warmth and heart in there too
","I'd not had my fill of Judd Apatow movies when it came to Bridesmaids being released, but to be honest I was wondering how he managed to get as much success as he had and I had not loved his films as much as everyone else; so, although he was only executive producer of this, it was enough to make me wonder if it was worth the money. I went anyway and was pleased to find that the film not only did his style of humour but did it in such a way that the viewer is along for the ride and cares about the film rather than being on the outside, which I had found can happen with some of his own stuff.Bridesmaids follows a group of women mostly in their mid-30's and focuses on Annie, who is semi-trapped in a f-buddy 'relationship' because it is at least something even though it is not what she wants. When her best friend gets engaged, Annie finds herself in a battle of one-upmanship with Lillian's new friend Helen (who is quite wealthy) in terms of showering the bride-to-be with love. At the same time as losing these battles, Annie's unhappiness also ruins other aspects of her life. It is a fairly relatable tale, even for men but more importantly it is very funny.In terms of the majority of the film what we have is a serious of comic misadventures for Annie as nice ideas turn sour; a pre-fitting meal turns into a terrible toilet-related experience, a fear of flying sees her drunk at 40000 feet and so on. All of it is pretty much par for the course (indeed the female characters even talk in the 'dude' language of Apatow's films) but yet it works because it has energy and imagination in its execution. The script is tight as a drum and the awkward aspect of the comedy is well used. What really made it work for me though, was that I felt the film had a genuine heart and warmth to it that isn't always there with similar films. I understood Annie and also cared for her, so I had a connection to the film beyond waiting for the next laugh. Although the comedy did involve nudity, sex, bodily functions and swearing, it never felt cruel towards the characters or that any of the characters were simply written that way to get a laugh. Even with Megan, she was a funny character, but she was still a character I liked rather than just being the butt of jokes. I laughed frequently throughout but at the same time still cared about the characters.The cast are all good even though it is the oddest cast selection I have seen in quite some time – so many odd sources, so many faces I know from TV (some of whom never even had a word to say). Wiig is really relatable and funny, with just enough edge of pained loneliness to carry that side of the film; OK she should pay 50% of her fee for this to Tina Fey because of how much of Fey is in her performance, but it works nonetheless. Rudolph is really natural and the rest of the group all have a similar air of realism. McCarthy is hilarious, even in little asides she is great; Kemper sort of repeats her Office turn to good effect; St Claire is funny in a limited way while Byrne is just a perfect bitch with money and fake smiles. The supporting cast beyond this are such an odd mix of names and faces that even a few days later I'm still thinking 'how did all of that come together'. Firstly the male lead is an Irish comedian famous for a UK sitcom; O'Dowd does a great job and I thought he had an easy chemistry that worked so well with Wiig, but he was still an odd find. Matt Lucas is here too, and there's Terry Crews in a tiny role (Everybody Hates Chris), and the N.General from Deadwood (Ajaye), and John Hamm, and Michael Scott's old boss David from The Office (who doesn't even get a word); it is an unusual cast to say the least but yet it works because everyone (even small roles) are on point.Bridesmaids is not too different from similar pack comedies that deal with grownup 'dudes' struggling with adult life, but yet as an end product it is stronger than these similar products. That the stars are women is neither here nor there, the difference is that although the very funny comedy is based on bodily functions, sex and exaggeration as normal, Bridesmaids remembers that it helps to like the characters involved and that it helps to give the film at least some heart and warmth. It is this sense of charm and warmth that made the difference for me – not only was I laughing frequently, but I actually liked the film for how nice it was as well.",Null,1,4,17 August 2011
Meet the Fockers," An extension of the original film done bigger but to lesser effect
","Firmly part of the circle of trust, Greg Focker is planning his marriage to Dina and has put off a big family get together for as long as he can. With no further excuses, Greg and Dina join Pam and Jack as they take their RV down to Florida to meet the Focker family. With an eye very much on his bloodline, Jack is keen to judge his future son-in-law by his parents, which spells problems when he finds himself living with two very liberal and touchy-feely Fockers.I'm in my thirties now and it probably is not very impressive that I can put words together in a basic sentence. Whereas for a two year old it might be a real surprise if they were to discuss their opinions on political matters as such with you. What is the difference? Well it is simply one of expectation. Coming to the subject of films, expectation can often make or break a film, with perhaps a poor Pauly Shore movie being better received by viewers than a poor Spielberg film partly because you expect that standard from the former but more from the latter. So it does help this film that with the very title you are informed that you are not about to witness the sharpest of comedies.With this in mind I went in with a forgiving eye, just hoping for laughs but I was not really prepared for how most of the film is unimaginative and base. In the first film we had Greg contrast with stern father Jack and hilarity ensues; here we have the same setup again but this time Greg is replaced as a device by his parents. What this means is that the film essentially aims at the same low targets as the first film and mostly hits them. To avoiding being too boorish on this subject I will admit that moments are funny and that the casting was a nice try but mostly I just found it obvious and dull. Toilet humour, a retread of the CIA stuff and so on supposedly provide the comedy while the drama is the same superficial relationship stuff as before.The cast mostly do their best to try and lift it. Stiller mugs along well enough but the real fun (such as it is) comes from De Niro and Hoffman. The former more or less just does his stuff again but is enjoyable enough, while the latter is at least having fun with a silly character. Streisand and Polo have lesser roles but still have a bit of fun, while poor Danner is just a plot device to try and the give the film some sort of centre. Cameos from Wilson and Nelson don't add much to proceedings and don't even get me starting on the annoying Pickren twins who are not only irritating but made more irritating by the way the film overuses them, apparently in the belief that 'Little Jack' is funny and/or cute when really he is neither. Roach's direction is nothing short of pedestrian  even the choice of theme music is obvious and easy.Overall then this is a film that people who really liked the first film will enjoy. Those that just 'liked' it may find that they didn't like it enough to watch it twice, which is what is happening here. The cast play it up as much as they can but really this is just an extension of the original idea done bigger but to lesser effect.",Null,14,18,11 March 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A visual feast but yet I wasn't gripped by the story or characters as much as I should have been
","When I heard that there was to be a film version of The Hobbit, I was quite looking forward to it as the big finish of Lord of the Rings was still in my mind and, unlike LotR, I had actually read The Hobbit several times many years ago. When I heard that it might be two films I wasn't surprised but the news that it was to be three did rather dampen my spirits as I don't know if I had the interest for this story to be concluded as 2016 rolls into town. Regardless I did of course watch the film because it is still a large blockbuster and, at a time of the year normally filled with overly earnest Oscar contenders, I did quite like the idea of returning to this world again.With this in mind I did wonder why I watched it with a surprisingly detached air and why I wasn't able to get into it like I should have done. I had some reservations with the first film in the LotR trilogy but this seemed different because it certainly wasn't a lack of action and forward motion that gave me a problem here. Quite the opposite actually because, once the first 45 minutes or so are out of the way then the action set-pieces come thick and fast and noisy. The opening hints at the power of the dragon to come before settling down for a gentle reintroduction to the Shire and then the characters we will follow; this section I found a little longer than it should have been and I could have done with a bit less noisy banter from the Dwarfs, since the film would provide much more from them. The majority of the film is the journey (or at least that bit of it that this film covers) and it produces plenty of action with great special effects really well integrated into the live action. So visually and technically there is plenty here. Problem is that little of it felt urgent or tense and actually the delivery of the constant action does rather detract from it.With Fellowship of the Ring, the group was smaller and the development of the plot better; additionally the action was more scaled down and comparatively simple. Here we have set-pieces where it feels like everything has been thrown at the screen and every inch of every frame has been filled with movement wherever possible. This tended to overwhelm me rather than draw me in though and in effect the noise prevented me really getting into it. Likewise by the time I had seen the characters survive impossible situations and defy gravity for the third or fourth time, the film sort of lost the ability to make me believe there was danger involved – which is a problem given I was already being pushed away by how busy and noisy it all was. Tellingly the scene that worked the best for me was with Gollum; this scene had tension, had uncertainity, had threat and did it all with small movements and dialogue; also worth noting that while Gollum is of course another special effect, you don't notice it in that scene because you are focused on the content instead of the visual.The cast sort of fit into this approach as well. While everyone is fine and does as required, at times they do tend to become part of the noise and effects rather than being characters. Freeman is a good Bilbo and his mannerisms work well (which helps negate his limited range) while of course McKellen is always welcome. The dwarfs didn't make much of an impression on me though, even if they all looked the part and delivered a few laughs. The rest of the cast are all fine but to be honest the effects are the main stars here and technically it is very impressive even if it is a bit overdone at times.I didn't dislike The Hobbit but at the same time I was disappointed in it. The action is noisy and busy but there isn't enough to draw me into the story or to make the action thrill me so much as it did overwhelm me. Hopefully the second film will see the characters and plots grow me on so that I am more emotionally bought into the films, but for this first one I must confess to being surprised by how much the film seemed content to have me watch from a distance rather than draw me in and engage me.",Null,222,305,26 January 2013
Before Sunset," Slight and fleeting but well written, sweet, natural and left me with a slight smile on my face even if it is all a bit idyllic and cheesy at times
","Six months after they originally met traveling around Europe, Jesse went to the place that Celine had agreed to meet him only to be left by himself. Almost a decade later Jesse has written a book based on this one night meeting and is on an European tour. At the Paris location, Celine arrives to meet up with him. Overjoyed to see her again but pressured to leave for the airport in an hour and a half, Jesse goes for coffee and a walk with her in order to talk and catch up.Its been almost 10 years since I saw the original movie and had a vague recollection of it but I wanted to go to the cinema to see a film. I was left with a choice of Spiderman 2 or this film and I plumped for Before Sunset (although I will see Spidy another time). The film opens with some flashbacks and a rather pretentious Jesse talking about his book before the film proper starts with the pair taking yet another walk. From here on in you need to be in at least a semi-romantic mood or the pace and tone of this film will just grate on you. For me, I was open to see where it went and, although some of it was a bit cheesy at times, generally I was carried along with it. The tone is quite natural and the romance is not forced, in fact it isn't really that much for a love story for the majority. The long conversations are enjoyable and engaging and it is these that gets us into these people's lives just enough to care about them. The wandering film continues to a conclusion that may frustrate some but was perfect for my needs. For my money it was the sheer amiable mood of this film that made it enjoyable. At the end of the film I had a little smile on my face and, although it was only a fleeting feeling from a film that won't stick in my head long, I did feel a little warm thanks to the film.Of course it isn't perfect and it will be easy for the 'real men' in the world to just dismiss it as nonsense and, partly, they are correct. The dialogue at times is very natural and seems to fit the characters but at other times it is very close to being part of a fondue set. Likewise the characters are not as 'real' as I would have liked  she's an environmental saviour and is pretty and friendly; he's a sensitive author type who has youthful good looks etc. At the start of the film the two actors played the characters very eager and all smiles and I hoped that they were doing this in the way we all do when meeting someone  putting on the pleasantries. But I hope that this would fade as hurt etc came out; it came but it was left very late in the film and the material was kept just a bit too sweet. Delpy is still good despite her rather self-righteous character but it took me longer to warm to Hawke who, although likable, was unconvincing as the man that the script told us Jesse had become. The two have a good chemistry though, and it is fun to walk through Paris with them listening to their conversations that are interesting, pretentious, flirting, funny and cheesy  but still enjoyable to sit through.Director Linklater does a good job using Paris as a backdrop without going for the really obvious locations or landmarks in a touristy film type of way. More than that though, I was impressed by the technical aspect of the film  long tracking shots in one take and an impressive moment where the camera follows them (from the side) up two flights of stairs. As writer he did OK and, if you're not able to accept a little bit of romantic dialogue and warm chat then you're in the wrong movie.Overall I enjoyed the movie but, had I been in the mood for action then I would have been less patient with it. At 80 minutes it is brief and sweet and left me feeling a little warm inside for a while afterwards. It is not the type of film that will stick in my memory for months to come but it did the trick for 80 minutes  I wandered round Paris listening to friends chatting. It's not all perfect  far from it, but it is fun if you're in the mood. As the final shot faded, the audience got up to leave with little smiles on their faces and everyone was polite and friendly as we left  I came out into the corridor as an earlier Spiderman 2 had just finished in the other screen and the place was packed with running teenagers, hyper kids, hassled parents  all a bit hyped up and bustling; in other words  for a calm, peaceful and warm Sunday afternoon I had picked the right movie to go to and, if that's what you want then try Before Sunset.",Null,9,19,30 July 2004
Non-Stop," Distracting but ultimately full of holes, laughable and forgettable
","Air Marshall Bill Marks is a troubled man – an alcoholic, an underachiever as a parent, cop and man, and really just has little going for him. Assigned to a direct flight to London, Marks settles in but within a few hours of the flight taking off he gets a message on the closed network that one of the passengers will die n 20 minutes if he does not arrange for a substantial amount of money to be transferred to a bank account. With time ticking down, Marks tries to figure out what is going on, but when the first death comes he finds himself isolated in the air in a high-stakes game where he can trust nobody.Although this film got pretty bad reviews I still wanted to see it since I figured that in fairness it is probably going to deliver at the low level I was expecting from it. In this regard it is actually quite watchable for someone who was recovering from a minor operation and just looking to have something to distract. The plot is as nonsensical as it sounds; I really wondered how they were going to make it all work, but the answer is that they don't. The writers seem to hope that you will not think forward or backwards in any situation and just focus on the moment, whatever is happening. This level of belief suspension is too much to ask though and the plot holes and narrative nonsense does come thick and fast at times, really just hoping you don't care enough to kick back against it.And in fairness I didn't care – which is not a glowing recommendation but nothing about it all made me care one bit. What remains from there are lots of professionally mounted moments of tension, with Neeson doing his new tough guy thing and the closed location doing its bit to add to the tension. It works at a very low level but I would be lying if I said I wasn't at least slightly entertained by bits of it. The problem is that it is a big deal film with a big cast and presence, and it is not unreasonable to hope that it would have been better. Ultimately though it is undone by its own lack of interest in the plot – it is only ever about the tension of the moment and the writing is roundly poor, from plot points to specific dialogue. It distracts at a very low level but ultimately it is full of holes, laughable and forgettable.",Null,1,3,3 June 2014
Man on the Moon," Lacks insight but is still very entertaining thanks to a great Carrey
","Andy Kaufman is a song and dance man who struggles to really be successful as a stand up in nightclubs as the audience are never really sure what the joke actually is.  When he is spotted by agent George Shapio, it allows him to get one of his characters onto a new sitcom.  With the success of the show he is given a stage to try different things - an opportunity that the studio regrets giving him when he varies wildly from a lounge lizard alter ego to a major show where he wrestles female audience members to the ground.As with many within the UK audience for this film, I only know Kaufman from his character in Taxi.  One thing I do know is that he was clearly a mystery with no-one, maybe not even himself, really knowing who he was or when he was being serious.  And that is what the film remembers - an enigma.  This is not the place to come for understanding, explanation or background; in fact the film skips from a brief flashback of Andy's childhood to 20 years later as a stand-up! In that regard, the film is a success because it nicely captures a man who it must have been hard to laugh at simply because he appeared to be more about having a laugh on his audience rather than at his audience.  On the strength of this film I quite like his style but am surprised he became so famous when it must have been quite hard to actually laugh at his work.The film may not do enough for those who know a lot about Kaufman's career simply because it doesn't cast light on anything - it only records some key events.  As I said, the film seems to be holding it's hands up and saying `look - we know about as much as you do' - it isn't even sure if Kaufman died for real or not.  I found it very funny though and it was an entertaining way of informing me about his career.Despite the lack of an Oscar nomination, it is Carrey who makes this film work so well - his performance is great, capturing Kaufman's routines as well as providing us with some tender moments.  DeVito is good in support even though it confused me as to who he was playing at first (Shapio or himself).  Love is not as bad as I feared she might be, although she has no character and she is still one of the weakest aspects of the film. Giamatti is as reliable as ever and is sterling in support.  Appearances from others as themselves are great and add class to the film - particularly Lawler, the cast of Taxi and several others.Overall I enjoyed this film but it engaged me because I knew so little about him.  For those who are familiar with him this film may not bring enough for them to justify seeing but even then it is lively, funny and centred on a great performance from Carrey.",Null,2,4,13 April 2004
The Princess Bride," Knowing modern fairy tale that sits between affectionate spoof and poor B-movie
","When a man visits his sick Grandson, he keeps him amused with a fairy tale. We find that the beautiful Buttercup has lost her true love and years later has agreed to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck.  She is kidnapped by three mercenaries but is later rescued by a mysterious masked man.  When she discovers the identity of the man she faces a dilemma between returning to her intended or staying with true love.  When the decision is made for her Wesley must fight (with a little help) to win her back.There is something about this film that requires you to be in the right mood to watch it.  The story is pitched as a standard fairy tale and it feels like a B-movie, if it was played straight.  Happily Reiner adds spoof and comedy to the mix that allows the fairy tale to follow the traditional routes while poking fun at itself.  The story is still nice, but really it's the knowing comedy that makes it.The comedy is generally consistent  gentle rather than cruel.  The film uses unlikely fairy tale mechanisms (like having the ideal thing to hand when needed or the idea of honour etc) with a knowing wink to the audience to let us know it's not serious.  It also uses comedy cameos by the bucket  some work well (Billy Crystal, Wallace Shaw) and some work less well (Peter Jones and Mel Smith are unused).  And the rest of it is full of absurd humour.  Most of it hits the mark  but if you're not in the mood of this type of silly affectionate humour then you'll probably dislike it.Elwes is good  he looks like a handsome B-movie actor and plays it like such, while also spoofing himself.  That's why he was so good in Hot Shots too.  A young Robin Wright does the wide-eyed damsel in distress so-so, but she doesn't get the same comedy as the others and feels a little dull. Mandy Patinkin is really good in a hammy role and has a good character. Shaw is hilarious in a small role and even Andre the Giant is good  if a little hard to understand at times.  The villains are well played by Guest and Sarandon  indeed they have the best characters as they don't play it for laughs as much as the others.Overall this is an enjoyable little film from Reiner  it doesn't have the development or the sharpness of much of his other, funnier work but as a gently affectionate spoof it works just fine if you're in the mood).",Null,6,13,16 March 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Excellent despite some Spielberg slips into sentiment
","During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed.  In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.What can I say  it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws.  The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war.  This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes.  The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done  it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown.  I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story.  Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often.  For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America.  Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well  although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits.  Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film  so of course they will focus on the American experience.  However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies.  I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful.  There's nothing wrong with focus  but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem.  It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's (ie  when America joined).However this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it's an American film  why be surprised when it's focus is Americans!  Of the cast Hanks is good  he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd.  He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc.  Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors.  Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up  although Damon has one of the simplest characters.  They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw  just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality.  Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be.",Null,182,325,11 September 2002
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Struggles a little early in the film and also with smaller character detail and emotion, but develops into a thrilling, exciting story with good danger and scares
","What I originally watched a few years ago as a fun Dreamworks animation with comedy, a moral message and cool dragons seems to have decided it is now going to be a trilogy and, in its attempt to make itself more than just a fun DVD to be put on for the children as a standalone but to instead be a franchise player, the second film takes a darker tone. It isn't one that is evident from the very start where we have minor characters involved in dragon races and Hiccup out avoiding responsibility, but it is not long until a plot involving dragon hunters and an enemy raising an army of dragon to capture and enslave other dragons. Gradually we get into a fairly dramatic plot that produces a lot of thrills, scares and probably tears before we get to the end of the film.It is a bridging film in the trilogy and as such it also bridges age- range as it reaches out to the audience that was four years younger when the first came out, tries to please the new younger audience coming in and also tries to make sure the adults are entertained too. In some ways it doesn't really manage this where in others it does. One of the ways it seems weaker is in the comedy; there are some laughs early on but soon the comedy is put to one side apart from a few hit and miss jokes along the way. It is also worth noting that for very young children, the action and its consequences may be too intense even if they are brilliantly done – for all Toothless' cuteness, some of the larger dragons are genuinely imposing and there are some dramatic scenes that will upset. That said, for the most part the action is thrilling and it is just a shame that it is so franticly edited so that it is dizzying at times. It does have a feel of danger and tension though and it is hard not to be moved by some of the plot.It is done with broad, thick strokes though; the film doesn't leave you with much doubt when you are supposed to have tears in your eyes, when to laugh and when to do a bit of both with relief that all is well after all. I guess part of this is a kids film but some of the dialogue seemed a bit forced and generally the delivery of smaller emotional moments lack realism and finesse – which is a shame because the much bigger moments are generally very well done indeed. Unfortunately for the cast these smaller moments put a lot of pressure on them, and it doesn't always work. I didn't care for Baruchel too much early in the film as he seemed unnatural but as it went on he was better with his material. Butler, Ferguson and Ferrera all did pretty good work although I really have no idea what Blanchett was doing – her character was pretty thin and the accent was terrible (all of them). Hounsou's voice helps his character have a lot of presence, which is needed considering how little detail there is to him; meanwhile Harington was a decent find in a role that teased about his impressive physique.HTTYD2 is not a perfect film but it is a very good one. It struggles with the broad, heavy strokes that it uses when it has smaller moments to detail, and also has a few misfires moving from being a comedy to be something more serious, but once it gets into the guts of its narrative it delivers a real ride of excitement and action and emotion that is worth seeing.",Null,2,6,10 August 2014
The Pianist," Far from cheerful viewing but an impacting and engaging film that helps keep history relevant
","Wladyslaw Szpilman is a musician living with his family in 1930's Warsaw. The rise of anti-Semitism starts to erode their civil liberties, making them have permits to work, requiring them to wear armbands that identify them as Jewish and generally treating them like second-class citizens and lesser people. This gradual slide becomes increasingly serious as all Jews are ordered into one small area of the city, where whole families are given flats with one or two small rooms to be shared among six or seven people. As the murders and control of the Jews continue, Szpilman is left to try and survive while the war rages across Europe.I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema despite the Oscars and rave reviews simply because I could never get my head in the right space to spend my time on a subject that was never going to be an easy watch. With it coming onto television recently though I decided it was worth a look and easily got into it, which the emotional power of the story doing enough to carry it along for the duration. At times it does feel like watching war porn, as Polanski wheels out one more shocking atrocity after another and occasionally feels like he is involved in a game of one-upmanship with other Holocaust movies (so we don't just have a man thrown out a window, but a disabled old man thrown out a window). This was a bit of a problem for me because I wanted more to the film that just the horror shown to me. However the film does do more than that and generally does enough to be as impacting in the study of Szpilman as it is in just yet again reminding us of the terrible things done in Europe barely 60 years ago.On both levels the film works while never being something you should try and watch expecting it to be a fun night in. Staying away from the front line of the war, the film focuses on the effects on the innocent, specifically Szpilman, who struggles to just stay alive. Up till this point the film had been a bit obvious, with bad things happening while the Szpilman's argue over what to do etc, with the film relying heavily on the shock and horror of what was happening. The rest of the film is more about him being left alone and hidden within Warsaw, which although slow is still impacting and engaging. At this point Brody also steps up and becomes much better than before, showing so much with just a horrified look but still containing enough of a character to be more than just our eyes. The rest of the cast are all good but generally it is Brody that carries the majority of the film. Polanski directs with a very good eye for the breakdown of this world and it looks totally of period and convincing.Overall then, not a film to come to if you are hoping for a cheerful night in but one to watch to gain a wider appreciation of the atrocities that can so easily be allowed to take place. Ethnic cleansing and wars continue even as I sit writing these words so those that think this film is just an unnecessary wallow in past horrors would do well to take a minute and think. At times it could have been better but it is impossible to ignore the power of the story and the impact of the delivery.",Null,4,10,2 April 2006
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Delightfully whimsical comedy adventure, with great design and fun performances
","I watch a lot of short films and you can tell that Wes Anderson has very much made an impact on up and coming filmmakers due to how often you see people trying to make what they call 'a Wes Anderson style film'. Watching these film is mostly interesting because of how often these efforts fall short. It is a reminder to me of how hard it actually is to do 'whimsy'. To make it work, you not only need to make it happen, but you also need to do it in a way that gets the audience into the space they need to be in so as to be able to enjoy it; without this it is often just annoying.I was thinking of this because GBH is a great example of this working. This is not to say it is brilliant cinema, because in the end it is a whimsical piece but it does do it really well. The structure itself tells you where you are, because this is a film that opens with a girl paying respects at the bust of a dead author, who we then jump to as he starts to tell the story that was told to him by another man – a story which is also that of a story being told – and it is this story which we see for the most part. It is a structure that allows for the exaggeration and elaboration of all told stories, and it allows us to go with the sheer silliness of the tale. I say silliness, but actually the film keeps a lot which actually engages in the adventure plot, but yet at the same time delivers enough decadence and invention to allow us to enjoy it as a piece of fun.The cast match this. In many films it would be a real distraction to have so many famous faces in one film, however here it works – again because the audience are mostly positioned just to go with whatever. Fiennes is the beating heart of the film, and if he does not make his character work then the whole thing would struggle; as it is, he makes it work really well, with such color and flourish. Revolori is equally good, and needs to be since the friendship and his link to the presence (or plural) is also critical to making it work. The rest of the cast contain so many famous names doing small but enjoyable turns that it is pointless to name them all – but they all add to the whimsy rather than overwhelm it. Technically the film is a beauty, with great shots, great design through, and a sense of second-hand wonder which fits the story-telling structure.All told, it is a quite wonderful piece of silly adventure. It works because it knows itself, and it delivers itself really well in a way that draws the viewer into the space we need to be in to really go with it. This is not easy to do, and Anderson does it really well here.",Null,4,6,6 March 2016
The Transporter," Vin Diesel can kiss my ass  this film is weak but at least it is FUN to watch
","Frank Martin is a transporter  a man who drives and delivers on behalf of criminals.  On one job he opens his `package' to find a young woman, Lai Kwai.  Despite this he completes the job and picks up another package from his customer, Wall Street.  On a break from driving his `package' then explodes.  He returns to his client and steals a car, unwittingly taking the girl with him.  Martin then finds himself the target of this gang and is put in a position where he must do the right thing.I'm not really a big action fan and the last few things I watched were disappointing, not living up to the hype.  XXX was a major let down for me. However the Transporter seemed to offer low-key action without a big Hollywood marketing campaign behind it.  First of all let me deal with the plot  it is nonsense from start to finish!  The film sets up Martin as a real pro in the exciting opening scene  but then expects us to accept that he opens the package and lets the girl escape scenes later, it just doesn't wash for me.  The rest of the plot sort of falls into place heavily and, when it needs to explain things, feels very slow and ponderous  it's better if you don't think about it.Despite the weak plot the film is very enjoyable simply because of the great action scenes.  They are a mix of well choreographed fights and OTT action. The OTT action is a little much but is enjoyable none the less (and doesn't look that OTT beside the excesses of XXX).  The fight scenes are very cool and Statham is very physical, doing some very cool moves.  It's these martial arts scenes that really make the film.  The soundtrack is pumping hip-hop.  It isn't great music but the pumping nature of the music fits well with the onscreen action most of the time.Statham is really good and is much tougher than Vin Diesel was.  Physically he is very impressive and he can really move when he wants to.  His cool, professional look is really good and had me hooked from the first scene.  Qi Shu is OK in the support and is quite playful, while Schulze is a standard bad guy.Overall this is the perfect film for a Saturday night.  It isn't great, the plot is weak and the ending is a little bit of an anti-climax with it's happy sunny ending, but the action is good and, more than some over hyped films, it is actually FUN to watch it  just don't expect all the bits to be good.",Null,4,8,2 February 2003
Seabiscuit," A professional feel-good true story that is entertaining despite lacking depth
","The country is booming and the future looks bright until, that is, the depression hits and near everyone finds their fortunes change for the worse. Rich families struggle to stay rich while the working men find themselves defining 'home' in an entirely different way than they once did. Charles Howard loses his son in the one of the very machines that he made his fortune selling and loses his way until he meets a new woman. The depression forces Red Pollard's family to let him stay with a horse-owning family so that he has a shot at a better life, while former horse trainer Tom Smith takes to riding the box carts looking for work. These three men cross paths years later when Howard decides to get into horses thanks to the influence of his new wife. Together they take on their undersized horse and over-sized jockey to go against the odds against the background of a country trying to get back on its feet.Despite being a best picture contender of a few years ago I never got round to seeing this film as it didn't really appeal to me but, screened as it was in the middle of the afternoon during Christmas it made for more of a proposition. The opening credits reveal how the telling is going to go as it all starts with a slightly sentimental approach of history around the depression. This continues with a rather sanitised view of history that focuses on the story surrounding this famous horse. The story is a simplified but effect one of 'losers' overcoming the odds in an allegory for the American spirit and the country coming out of the Depression. This is a big aim and of course aspects suffer as a result of it trying to be out so much. The emotions never get deeper than the superficial and sweeping but the film is glossy and professional enough to get away with this and produce a feel-good film with its hooves in a true story.The casting matches this by being impressive as professionals even if nobody really excels in their performance. Maguire is a good lead even if his character doesn't give him a huge amount to work with at times. Bridges and Cooper are better simply because they have stronger characters. All three of them are best in the moments where they get to look into the middle distance with a sense of pride while the music swells  it is that type of movie and they all work to that well enough. Support is mostly good but they are all doing the same. Ross writes and directs well; he can't find the depth in any part of it but the film looks great and is professional and slick  just what the material required.Not a great film then but an unsurprising nominee for best picture at the Oscars. It does raise the spirits and it works really well at the superficial level with a great sweep to it helping to compensate for the lack of depth within the story and characters.",Null,2,4,4 January 2007
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Looking, not feeling in a film where spectacle takes priority over all else
","There is quite a lot of punctuation in the title of this film and as one would expect there is a lot of action in the actual film itself. The plot here sees the entire IMF disavowed, leaving Ethan Hunt and his team to try and prevent a nuclear war with just the four of them (and loads of clever gadgets). It is an effort that takes them across the globe and puts them in constant danger.It has been over 15 years since the first Mission: Impossible film was made and it seems that the path the series is taking is set. For all its faults I enjoyed the original film because I thought De Palma's direction was excellent in regards several of the set-pieces, creating tension and a sense of actual danger. Jump forward in time to this film though and what we get is something that seems much more focused on the visual rather than the feel – perhaps due to the direction of Bird, someone who knows a thing or two about how things look. So, just like the first film, we get lots of set-pieces across the 2 hour plus running time and indeed many of them are cleverly put together and have a real look of the spectacular about them. Climbing the tower in Dubai is the most obvious, but a fight in an automated multi-storey car park is just as good. Visually it mostly looks great and this is why you will often find people telling you to go and see this on as big a screen as possible – because the images are by far the best thing about the film, so why not make them bigger (and therefore better)? The only caveat to this praise is that for some reason the back projection of images is awful throughout. There are some large sequences where the cast are on green-screen and all of them are badly done; no idea why, but they stand out all the more when in a film where the images and effects are generally good.To a point this works; to a point. A film constructed on such images certainly makes it very easy to market in a trailer which samples these many images, but when it comes to the two-hour film more is needed and unfortunately it isn't there. My girlfriend commented at the end that M:I-GP was basically lots of separate action setups but with nothing at all in between, and she is right because that is how the film works. There are some attempts at character-development or intrigue but mainly the whole film exists because of the collection of set-pieces that are evenly spread across it. In between there isn't anything worth noting, the plot is standard stuff, the comedy doesn't really fit particularly well and there is nothing but the feeling of time being filled. This time in between needed to be used to engage the viewer and make us care and because it isn't, the visual set-pieces remain just that – visual. I never felt the team were in danger, never felt there was a risk to what they were doing or that I should care beyond being impressed by the scale of the images in front of me.The cast are basically just points on the screen to be the focal point within bigger things to look at – there isn't really a 'performance' here to talk about. Cruise works hard but I am biased because I always find him cheesy and obvious – his final scene with his team is by far the best/worst example of this but throughout he is unable to convince for me (but I know others love him, so each to their own). Renner is capable of much more than this and, although he is a nice addition, he doesn't get much to do. Pegg is quite amusing but needed a bit stronger material to be better. Patton looks awesome – this is her task and it is a task she performs admirably. Various goons come and go without much to tell them apart – again they are furniture, not actors. Brad Bird's direction is strong in the action sequences and he is part of the film being as successfully visually as it is, however he cannot find much below this level and even when the words on the page are saying there should be more, it still doesn't come off.Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is not an awful film, indeed it is a fun film to watch on a Saturday night because there is a lot going on but yet very little attention or thinking is required. It is about the spectacle though – nothing else, sadly not even the 'action' because only once or twice did I find it exciting, mostly I just found it visually impressive. I watched this film – I didn't feel it. It is a big budget franchise so it will make money and they will make more of it and of course I will return for my fix of 'spectacle', but I do hope the next film puts some content in there and can produce the feeling of tension and danger, not just the look of it.",Null,1,3,1 April 2012
Revolutionary Road," Problems with approach and aspects of writing are covered by strong performances to make a generally convincing and engaging drama
","Revolutionary Road was another in the very crowded period ahead of the awards season, rolling into UK during a very busy January/February period for 'worthy' films. Some of them were genuinely good and some of them were perhaps cosmetically worthy but weren't as good as they were been touted as. I caught this one of the awards bunch after Oscar and Bata were out of the way so I wasn't really concerned by these matters while watching it. Being set in a suburb of America in the 1950's, it is no surprise to anyone to learn that people are trapped and perhaps a little unhappy with their cosmetically 'perfect' life Â– this is territory that has been covered before and covered well, to the point where it is hard to believe anyone in this setting/period was ever happy with their lot. Frank and April are a couple with young children, he is a salesman in a job he hates and she is a housewife. We are shown a little of their past and meeting but mostly we are put straight into the middle of a relationship that is being stifled and the two of them are short with one another at least. They plan a way out of the trap they feel stuck in but, while the details may not be obvious, you do sort of know the vague arch that the narrative is about to take.In itself this is not a problem because the scenario being familiar doesn't mean that everything about the film will be as well. In the sweep it is important to note that the film does work as being a quite realistic and depressing vision of long-term relationships. As such it engaged me and I did really enjoy the film and it seemed to move very quickly. This is different from saying it is brilliant and perfect though, because it isn't. The narrative arch doesn't allow much empathy for the characters and this appears to bleed into the scripted creation of them because I never felt like I was allowed to be inside the marriage at any point and that I was always watching things from the side. This problem is minimised though because both of the lead performances are very strong when they are given the chance. DiCaprio and Winslet play very well off one another and their convincing relationship made a lot of things work.It is almost a shame then that the narrative does tend to find bigger things for them to argue over other than minor comments or gestures, because in these moments the film and the actors are at their most convincing. When people feel trapped or want out of a relationship, not only do you have the big fights but you also have the pointless niggles and fights over nothing that are all fed by the bigger issue. The film did not create enough of these (the scenes after the play were the closest to this) and the bigger things do feel more melodramatic without these. It doesn't help that, to get the bigger thoughts of the characters across, the script uses Shannon's Givings to say things out loud. His performance is good but his character and his use within the film is weak and he never feels like a person so much as an easy device pulled in to help the writers.Visually the film looks good, It doesn't quite have the feel of the period in the way that Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven did but it still works. Costumes and sets deserved credit while Mendes and Deakins work well with the camera without channelling Douglas Sirk. Indeed Mendes does direct well but he doesn't seem to have much love for his characters, letting them go at one another with bitterness without really seeking to understand or feel for them. Maybe I'm putting too much at his feet in this regard but I did get the impression of him sitting back rather than being involved.Despite my problems with it, Revolutionary Road is still a good film, just not the brilliant one that much of the awards hype suggested. The ground has been covered before and there are problems with the approach and the script but it still engages and depresses as it should. DiCaprio and Winslet are both very good and, as a bitter cynic, I did enjoy seeing them acting out the logical progression of their 'love' in Titanic. Not a perfect film by any means but a good solid entry in the suburban-misery genre (and it must soon qualify as a genre).",Null,1,5,26 March 2009
28 Days Later...," Flawed but thrilling British horror movie
","In England a group of animal rights activists break into a research facility to free monkeys.  However the monkeys are infected with a new developed virus called rage which is contagious by blood or bodily fluid - at the same time Jim lies in a coma.  28 days later Jim awakens from his state to find London deserted and populated only by a group of those infected by rage. Jim is rescued by Selena and her friend who tell him what has happened and start a search for other survivors and a quest to find the cure, promised by a military unit stationed in the north.I excitedly arrived at the preview for this looking forward to a tense British horror movie to make me jump with fear.  I got pretty much what I wanted.  The plot is simple and omits much detail but not to it's disservice.  Details as to what the virus is or what it was created in the first place (by putting monkeys in front of TV's Clockwork Orange style?) but the detail is not important seconds into the film when we wake up with Jim.  At this point his fear becomes ours and what is important to him is not the detail but the bigger picture of the infected and the chances of survival.The plot is told in two parts.  First the big picture in London and then the smaller battle north of Manchester.  Both are well told but for different reasons.  The bridging section of the journey north is good as it helps us know the characters better.  Of course is it scary?  Well, not scary but thrilling all the way.  To me scary is things like Ringu - creepy stuff, but most will be freaked by 28 days later.  The infected are not zombies in definition or in action - they move silently and fast and with pure blood lust. I was always more scared by zombie flicks than anything else becomes they keep coming - here they do the same but fast!The direction is good for the most part.  The opening scene in London just shows how badly Crowe did his bit in Vanilla Sky.  Here it is clever and chilling to see much of London totally empty.  The direction is better when it is fast cutting and handheld style.  We see things like the characters would see them out of the corner of their eyes, a flicker, a shadow etc and it works to great effect.  The only downside is that, at one or two points, the attacks were signalled by a preceding talking 5 minutes, but this is minor.  The final rain soaked action is excellent - fast, gripping and paced.  This film doesn't rely on gore or special effects (although it is there) instead it has genuine tension and fear.The film is very British.  It is very low-key and realistic.  The survivors are not Mad Max style heroes but people clinging to life by a thread or setting up survivalist measures that simply don't work.  The ending is not as good as I had hoped but it wasn't bad and it fitted with the tone of reality that Jim had realised when lying on his back in the woods towards the end.  It's not without flaws but the film is a very good British horror film - Americans will wonder `where are all the teenager girls to scream' or `why don't they all have guns' or `why is there no real dah-dah music to tell us when something is going to happen' but that is because this is a British film and not Hollywood.Most reviews have praised the `unknown' cast.  Well I agree the cast did very well - but unknown?  Murphy certainly is not unknown (and won't be from now on) and he does Jim very well, from when the truth is first real to him, to his decision that he must learn to kill through to his transformation near the end.  Harris is excellent again, I say again as she did well in miniseries `white teeth'.  Her accent is British and she plays a younger role but she is a good actress.  Brendan Gleeson is good in a fatherly role but Eccleston seems clipped and at odds with his military role.  In fact all the military guys were laddish caricatures and only just did the job - but I never believed in their characters as I did with the others.Overall I was glad to see this early.  I really enjoyed it, the pace at times may have been uneven but to me that added to the tension - an attack could come at any time.  The eventual small scale focus helped the tension and pace of the story.  Thrilling, scary, tense and well written - even more surprising is that it's home grown!",Null,118,176,30 October 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Less a movie than a chance for more merchandising
","It transpires that a second site had been created as a backup to the original island, John Hammond sends a party out including Dr Sarah Harding to visit the island.  When Ian Malcolm finds his girlfriend is on the island he sets out (with his daughter in tow) to rescue her.  However once on the island the group find that a second group is also on the island, however the second group doesn't seek to study but rather to hunt the dinosaurs.  With the destruction of the groups' communication equipment they find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the islands inhabitants.This cash in title is also based on a Michael Crichton novel.  However it manages to have all the same problems of the original but doesn't have the same excitement in the action scenes.  The plot is quite stretched in an attempt to get everyone on the island.  Once there, there are some really good action scenes - the T-rex attack one the caravan and the raptor attack in long grass are pure Spielberg, but most of it falls a little flat (the final T-rex attack is lazy spectacle).  However it's loud enough and big enough to be enjoyable when it's on the screen though.I found the whole question of genetics a little hard to swallow - I can accept that dinosaurs can be recreated from amber encased blood, but no way on God's earth can Ian Malcolm's daughter be that black!  She is a lot better a child than those brats that were in the first film, but racially there's no way that she's mixed race!  Anyway - she is really good without being irritating.  Goldblum does his scientist stuff again and counts the money.  Julianne Moore is wasted - such a great actress, here she is reduced to running round in shorts!  Postlewaithe at least seems to know he's in a poor money spinner and gives his role a degree of dignity before just disappearing at one point!  Vince Vaughn and Peter Stomare are also good but only do the action man stuff when they are capable of so much more.Yes the action scenes are quite good - but at the end of the day this feels very much like a package rather than a film - see the film, eat the meal, get the toy!  Don't we deserve better than a 2 hour advert for a happy meal?",Null,5,11,8 February 2002
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Solid story with a strong central character delivered by great CGI (SPOILERS)
","Having given enough for my money to summer blockbusters in previous years, I decided to sit out all the massive hits of 2011 and pick them up on DVD later on down the road. So far my decision was proved to be a good one and I threw the new Planet of the Apes movie into the same pile – especially since I only found out such a film existed a few weeks before it came out. As it turns out though, Rise is actually one of the better blockbusters out this year – not because it has the biggest set-pieces but mainly because it builds itself on a solid character and solid story.I say solid because Rise is not an amazing film but it is an entertaining one and it benefits from having more emotional appeal to it than your Thors, your Captain Americas or your Transformers 3. Rise is the very definition of an origin story as it presents the first ape in the simian spring that will lead to the fall of man. It is pretty well done even if it does have to cover a lot of years (in which our human characters do not appear to have aged even a second of course). It isn't perhaps as smart as I would have liked or as full of commentary as it could have been but it does benefit from a strong heart in Caesar.While the human characters are mostly surprisingly weak (with the exception of Lithgow), Caesar is a great character and the special effects are well used to translate his feelings and thoughts to the viewer and I found that a lot of my interest in the story was because of my interest in him. How the film manages to do this well but mostly fail at all other characters and thoughtful commentary I'm not sure. We spend so much time with the detail of Caesar's situation that we perhaps lose developmental time for the humans and interactions that could have produced things of interest just don't happen. A key example for me is the final scene between Caesar and Will – there is loads of stuff between these two characters but nothing happens of note, a waste chance for some real meat and it is not the only one. It doesn't help that the human cast don't have a lot to work with. Fraco is a solid presence but too wishy-washy while Pinto may be easy on the eye but is too vague and unnecessary to bother with. Oyelowo is supposed to be a villain of sorts but is just a pragmatic businessman for the majority. None of them really have much to work with.The final third of the film starts to deliver a pay-off and in particular the effects and drama of the escape are well played out, but as much as I enjoyed this I did wonder why I went away from the film feeling that, while it was OK, it wasn't anything amazing. Part of this is the fact that the story here feels like such a small part of something much bigger and that just as it starts getting somewhere we are suddenly at the end of the film. I mean, this is a film that includes the fall of man at the hands of a virus but yet does it in the end credits (albeit with a well designed and effective visualisation of the spread). It is hard not to feel like we were forced by the telling to focus much tighter than the bigger picture deserved.Considering the rather serious tone of the film, the occasional throwback or reference to the original films is unwelcome. They are so obvious and in your face that even those who have not seen any Planet of the Apes movies before will recognise the dialogue and what it means is that they just clunk onto the screen bringing no benefit at all. The references aren't funny or clever and all they do is break the scene they occur in, which is a shame.Overall Rise is one of the best blockbusters of the 2011 season, which is fairly damning when you consider that it is only a solidly good film rather than something memorable. The effects are impressive and they are well used to create a strong central character well played by Serkis, but beyond this the plotting feels too focused and missing a bigger picture while also failing to deliver really interesting commentary and characters. It is a solid summer film, but nothing more than this.",Null,2,7,7 December 2011
City of God," A really slick and impressive gangster movie
","In the slums of Rio de Janeiro is an area called the city of God.  In this area children often do not make it to adulthood.  Rocket is a young man looking to use photography to get himself out of the slums and away from crime.  We follow his story from a child through the 60's and 70's in the slums where he is witness as children Lil' Dice and Bene grow up to become the heads of the gangs, using violence and murder to increase their power.I had missed this in the ONE art cinema in the city I live in and had to wait for the DVD to come out.  It was very much worth the wait.  I wanted to resist the urge to call this film `the Brazilian Goodfellas' simply because everyone else has said it - but it is a fitting description.  Like that film, this is a sprawling story of crime and violence across several decades.  And like Goodfellas it is violent, stylish and a great story that is engaging.  The overall plot focuses on the rise of Lil' Ze and the violence around him, as seen through the eyes of Rocket.Opening with a stylishly shot standoff, the film jumps back over twenty years and begins to introduce a range of characters who come and go throughout the film to give a back story of violence and crime.  The film jumps around quite a bit but it serves to build up a picture of the area and the characters involved.  The violence is not gory but it is sudden and shocking - children killing children, bloody sudden deaths and so on; but it is not sensationalised but rather very depressing and down to earth.The direction is very slick and the overall production and feel of the film is one of style and imagination.  The opening of a 360 pan around Rocket is an indication of the style than runs through the whole film.  It even manages to have a mix of styles - fast cutting edits work best in moderation, which is exactly what this film does.  The soundtrack is great and the film definitely owes a debt to Scorsese.The cast are very talented and very natural considering that few of them have any experience acting.  Alexandre Rodrigues is great as Rocket even if he gets overshadowed by Leandro Limrino attention grabbing Ze (in the same way as we all remember Joe Pesci over Ray Liotta).  The rest of the cast is almost perfect to a boy.  Even the young children are convincing and powerful and there are no bum notes in the performances - it is very impressive but the sad thing is that I suspect that for many of them, this was not a stretch as this is really their life.Overall this is a tremendous film - easily the best of the year.  It is slick and stylish but not at the expense of the story, which is a dizzy collection of characters and action.  If you like Goodfellas then you will simply love this film.  Hell, if you like cinema - you will like this film.",Null,9,18,25 December 2003
Cars," Good but not great film whose main failing seems to be just not hitting the bar set by its predecessors
","Lightening McQueen is a rookie racing in The Piston Cup and set to make history by being the first rookie to win it as it comes down to a three way decider between him, a retiring champion and the car who has been building his whole career to this victory. However while on his way to California for the deciding race, Lightening gets separated from his trailer and finds himself on the interstate and suddenly the thing he has never needed as a race car has become important  headlights. Lightening gets off the road and speeds his way through a small town where he is caught for speeding and sentenced to community service. While the small town people grate on Lightening, he knuckles down to the task, knowing the clock is ticking.For some reason Cars was not as well received by critics as some other Pixar films had been but I was confident that the studio could still give me something worth seeing. Watching it I can understand why the film maybe didn't go down that well but this is far from saying that the film is no good or even average. The film has a solid plot where we have an arrogant hero learning valuable life lessons from 'simple' folk and pretty much you know where it is all going to go and indeed so it does. The twist here is that the characters are all cars and I did enjoy the logic within this alternative universe and it was this that made the film for me because I didn't find the plot strong enough on its own. However the themes of the racing world, simple townsfolk, media hype and so on are better such as they are done.Two hours is probably too long to sustain though and the material does feel a bit stretched at times and it doesn't quite zing along in the way some other Pixar films have, where everything comes thick and fast. This is particularly evident in the laugh department because the film is not really that funny although it does manage to be consistently amusing  again it does feel a bit harsh to be criticising a film for this but I suppose the phrase is 'victims of their own success' when it comes to Pixar because it is hard not to compare with the previous films, all of which have set the bar very high. The touches are all fun (I loved the cows in this alternative reality) and generally it is all good stuff but personally I did miss the really strong 'one-liner' characters.This is not to criticise the cast because I did really enjoy Shalhoub and Quaroni in these side roles but just that the material didn't serve them as well as others have been. Wilson was a good bit of casting as his usual character fits Lightening well. Likewise Newman seems like a no-brainer and his voice is a great presence. Hunt is so-so and Larry the Cable Guy is good, if a bit one-note. Cheech, Lewis, Dooley and others are reasonable if not that great. Minor roles from Piven, Keaton, Leno, Schumacher and others add colour (well, the latter adds the colour 'grey' in his own unique style). Although Ratzenberger does have a small role in the main film, I did enjoy his contribution to the end credits.Overall then this is an enjoyable and consistently amusing film from Pixar and the only real problem with it is that it is certainly not up to their usual standard in regards mixing laughs with a strong plot. Not brilliant but I think it is a sort of backwards compliment to the high standards set by Pixar that a film that is just a solid 'good' comes over a bit disappointing.",Null,2,5,24 April 2008
The Little Mermaid," Colourful and fun; watchable and quite enjoyable for adults but really not layered well enough for my money
","King Triton rules the underwater world with his four daughter  all respectful and musical beauties, except youngest daughter Ariel, who has an unhealthy obsession with the world outside of the ocean. To try and make sure she cuts this out, Triton assigns his trusted aide Sebastian to keep an eye on her. However when Ariel visits the surface of the ocean she spots a beautiful prince on board a ship  minutes before the ship sinks and she is forced to rescue him. Naturally she falls in love with him from that moment on  much to the anger of her father. With his words still stinging her, Ariel accepts the offer of sea-hag Ursula to become human for three days and either a) make the prince love her and thus stay human or b) fail and return to the ocean and belong to Ursula.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However, having greatly enjoyed Beauty and the Beast the other night, I decided to give this film a try as well but must admit that I didn't take to it as much as I had hoped. The story is good enough to provide a narrative flow but I didn't buy into it emotionally as much as I had expected. The story didn't quite have enough of a sense of maturity or wonder as I needed and I didn't find enough else to distract from me. I was never bored you understand, but it was more that I could watch it with kids rather than really enjoy it and get something from it on my level.The songs are quite good and featured one or two that are pretty catchy and stuck in my mind. The animation is good but is very big and colourful, full of soft edges and non-threatening shapes; this results in the film having feel that it is really for kids rather than adults  an impression not really helped by the story that never goes deep enough into the emotional aspect for adults. The voice work is reasonably good and doesn't feature many famous voices  a practice that is not so common now but maybe helps from distracting from the material by spotting the stars. Benson is quite nice, Mars is firm and warm, Wright is good and the choice of accent in this film but it was quite nice. None of them are that distinctive and it is only really the late Buddy Hackett that stuck in my mind.Overall this is a colourful and enjoyable film but one that didn't do enough in terms of material and emotional content to really engage me. The film will be great for kids and provide more than basic laughs and I did enjoy it for what it did well but I did want it to do more  perhaps watching it in the same week as the much classier Beauty and the Beast was a mistake but this is a good film, not a great one.",Null,2,5,27 March 2005
Avengers: Infinity War," Works better than it has any right to do
","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.",Null,5,7,27 August 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A beautiful story of good v's evil and unrequited love
","When a mystical sword is stolen it sparks a quest to find the thief, who may or may not be the mysterious Jade Fox.  This not only causes the unrequited love between Master Bai and Yu Shu Lien to be further postponed by duty, but also signals the development of Jen Yu and her romantic discovery.  As the identify of the thief is gradually revealed a showdown looms with both Bai and Lien representing the good and the thief representing evil.A wonderful film in that it managed to make a whole generation of multiplex-only movie watchers that not all good things only come out of America.  However there is much to enjoy in this film that still will have been lost on such an audience.  The film mixes a raft of subplots around the main focus of the theft of the sword.  However we also have the development, romance and envious greed of Jen Yu, the conflict between Yu and Yu Shu Lien and of course the love between Master Li Mu Bai and Lien that has been put off due to duty.The stories all work well - the mystery surrounding the stolen sword and the search for Jade Fox make for a compelling mystery while the romance between Master Bai and Lien is beautifully observed throughout.  The story surrounding Jen Yu is very good as it follows her development throughout however her desert romance is perhaps a little too slow for a martial arts movie.  The only complaint about the stories is that they are a little heavy for a martial arts film - or maybe there is too much fighting for a well plotted movie?  Actually it's probably a brave mix that has some of the best of both worlds.The martial arts action is sensational - Yuen Wo Ping excels himself with one stunning visual treat after another.  The wire work is great even by Hong Kong standards - imagine the impact this had on an audience who thought that wire-work had been invented by the Matrix!  The standout scenes are the battle between Lien and Jen Yu and the Jen Yu's battle in a crowded barroom. The only complaint I did have is that the treetop fight near the end was not as exciting as other scenes and was also the least realistic and came across as silly at times.  In terms of visuals, the film is beautifully shot and picks up the gorgeous Chinese landscape well - the only problem being that this seems to distract from the main story.Michelle Yeoh is as impressive and as beautiful as she is in everything else I've seen her in - you can keep your Julia Roberts rom-coms, I want more of Yeoh's acting talents rather than pure star power.  Chow Yun-Fat is excellent as Master Bai and he works well in his scenes with Yeoh.  He even manages the martial arts really well despite not having made one before but I would have liked to see first choice Jet Li in the role.  The standout is Zhang Ziyi in only her second film.  She shines in the most difficult character and manages to convey so much and still be excellent in complex fight scenes.  And how does Hollywood reward her? By sticking her in Rush Hour 2!  That's like taking a beautiful flower and trying to plant it in the middle of a concrete slab!Overall it's a little slow for the martial arts crowd but it is a wonderful mix of Lee's art house films and the martial arts genre.

JFK," It may not be fact but Stone delivers with pace and easily grips for pretty much the whole running time
","November 22nd, 1963. Dallas, Texas. The 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy is shot dead as he goes through the city in his motorcade. After initial doubts about the official conclusions on the incident, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison opens up an investigation into the assassination. He uncovers clues to a conspiracy that seems to come from the very top but witnesses are hard to come by and the further through the looking glass he goes the more danger he puts himself and his family in.Watching an Oliver Stone film can be a wearying experience at times. Often the effect of his films can be like have him standing in front of you shouting for a couple of hours, however here his style is perfectly set with a script that, whether you believe it or not, pulls you along at a terrible pace.  As a piece of fact this film is bogus and it is up to each viewer to decide how much of it they want to accept or dismiss, but if you based your opinions on this film alone then you are too easily led.  What it does do though is present a vast number of questions for you to take away, and it does that very well.  The story relies heavily on theory, suggestion and characters who are combination of many, many small sources (combined for obvious reasons in the context of story telling).It is a problem that this is presented as fact but I can forgive Stone that as he delivers it in such a thrilling manner.  The story rarely lets the pace drop and the `facts' come thick and fast as we go deeper into Stone's `truth'.  It is a breath taking ride and one that benefits from great direction, fantastic editing and a great mix of footage and stock.  In the middle of this is a near-faultless performance from Kevin Costner.  As I write this it is the accepted norm to hate him and every film with him in it - I don't entirely know why, but regardless he is great here.  The perfect example of what he brings to the film is in the 20-minute courtroom scene where he is mesmerising.  Hate him or not, it is impossible not to acknowledge his contribution to this film being so gripping.Costner is supported by a great cast who do well regardless of their characters.  Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci have the least palatable characters in the film but they deliver them very well.  Oldman plays his patsy very well and Garrison's team includes performances from Rooker and Sanders that help the tension and pace.  Bacon is as good as ever, as is Sutherland and they stop you thinking that their characters are fictional. Turns from Matthau, Lemmon D'Onofrio, Vince, Candy and Knight are also great value.  There isn't really a weak link in the film - each performance seems to add urgency to the film.Overall, this film will put many off as it really appeals to those who are open to ideas or love conspiracy theories.  If you aren't one of these then the film may just irritate you but, whether you accept it as fact or not (I don't) it is still very interesting and is presented with such wonderful style and vigour by Stone and made all the better thanks to a series of good performances led by a real killer from Costner.",Null,8,29,13 April 2004
Behind The Candelabra," Not too much insight but plenty of energy and color in this broad and professionally-mounted film
","Although it got very good reviews I didn't watch this film when it was released (as indeed it was in the UK, where it got a cinema release). I really didn't know much more about Liberace than his name and reputation, and to be honest didn't see any reason to really know more. I still felt that way before and after the film but despite this I did think ti was a really well crafted film that is worth seeing. Based on the autobiography of one of the two main characters, Candelabra follows the relation of Liberace and his young lover Scott Thorson. In doing so we see what type of person we have and generally how things went.I say generally because it is never a film that really gets inside the characters and explores them so much as it explores the events and broad flamboyant strokes. On that level it doesn't have much going for it but in the broad strokes it is quite excellent. The basic narrative is full of color and is engaging throughout as we see Scott go down the well- worn path that it was obvious he always good. Seeing this journey and then the added conclusions of Liberace is what makes the film work and it has a lot going on, with a sense of the flamboyant and comical throughout.Stylistically the film embraces the period and the lifestyle, with great sets, costumes, characters and sequences. The cast equally latch onto this. Douglas is great; really good energy and presence, and he is able at least to find a person in there that the script doesn't do as much to help him with. Likewise Damon is very good despite the person getting lost in the broad strokes. Support is mostly equally fun â€“ particularly a turn from Rob Lowe, but the cast is deep in names and faces with Bakula, Aykroyd, Koechner, Reiser and others all getting the tone of the film.There may not be a lot of insight in here, but it is a film that has a great broad stroke and delivers it well, from the design of the film through to the performances. Well worth a look for what it does well, even if it is limited in certain areas.",Null,1,3,8 June 2014
Gone Girl," Trashy but expertly delivered (SPOILERS)
","When this film came out there was a lot of very positive reviews on it, and I also was aware that it was based on a book (which I then saw lots of people reading). These factors plus the names involved brought me to the film expecting a very high-brow affair with lots of soul searching and seriousness. I was very surprised then to find that actually this was a much more trashy affair – a thriller asking a lot of suspension of belief but rewarding it with a twisty-turny plot and a good strong sense of urgency.This latter quality is probably what makes it work so well, because it is a very well crafted film with a lot going on around the actual narrative. This is not to say that it needs it, because the central plot has plenty of forward motion to engage and intrigue. Fincher probably delivers it a little poe-faced for what it ultimately ends up being (the ending is enigmatic but seems a little out of place in terms of the 30 minutes prior to it) but it is hard not to like what he does with the material. The structure works very well, and there is a consistent cold atmosphere to it that sits well with moments of rage, spite, or out and out gore. There are interesting things here too; the media frenzy and involvement in everything is shown for what it is, warts and all, even though it is under control to not be more than a supporting thread. In terms of what it says about marriage, that we have basically got Fatal Attraction but from within rather than without, I'm not sure, and wasn't totally sure how comfortable I was with the way it worked that angle, but it did give me something more to mull.The cast are mixed but mostly strong. Affleck is probably the least engaging because he plays his character well. Awkward, conflicted, out of his depth, he seems like a tall wet rag at times, which I guess in the point but it does mean he tends to be second fiddle to whomever he shares a scene with. Not so Pike; she is fantastic throughout her twisty character – convincing whether she is weeping, coldly destroying someone's life, or conducting terrible acts with a cold, distant look. In support Coon and Dickens are very good and drew me in with their characters. Perry was an odd but enjoyable find, while Harris was solid playing away from the material he is famous (again) for. Pyle was probably miscast as she was a bit heavy and obvious for the media role; meanwhile the cast throws up some other memorable appearances – I was surprised by Ratajkowski being actually pretty good since previously I, like most of the world, only know her for her comfort being naked for Robin Thicke.In the end I am not sure it is as smart or worthy as the production itself suggests – with its cinematography, great score, big names, and overall presence; but it is still a very engaging and entertaining film with a twisty thriller plot, plenty of events, and lots that keeps the viewer on their toes.",Null,2,8,18 January 2015
Django Unchained," Works really well despite so much of it seeming to be at odds with itself
","Beyond the name and a cameo by Franco Nero, the story here has nothing in common with the original film series being referenced, although the genre and the design do of course have a lot of common ground. The story here sees a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter freeing a slave who can identify three men who have a considerable bounty on their heads. Despite being an one-time deal, the partnership works so well that the two stay together for more work, although the slave (Django) only has one overall goal – to find his wife and buy her freedom.The film opens with all the tropes that tell you that this will be an exploitation-style western; the music is of its time, the credits are blood red in that wonderfully gaudy manner and the camera movement is knowing but effective, and indeed this is what we get from the film as a whole – a bloody exploitation western that refers the grindhouse films that Tarantino idolizes so much. However to suggest that this is all the film does is to somehow miss the fact that it does so much more. Despite being trashy in some regards, it is brutally unsettling in others – some scenes of cruelty to slaves are very hard to stomach. On top of this we have the usual dialogue scenes that Tarantino is very good at – just like Inglorious Bastards had some incredibly tense scenes of just talking, Django has many great dialogue scenes – some are conversations with a bubbling tension, others are monologues delivered to camera in such a way that you are gripped by what the character is saying. Then we have the other thing Tarantino – sudden bloody violence, and it is very bloody here – excessive, OTT and very well executed. And just in case this mix isn't convoluted enough, the film also takes the time to have plenty to laugh at whether it is the flamboyantly written characters or the comedy set-pieces which include a clan raid having wardrobe issues. It really shouldn't work – I have seen other films trying to do several things in the same film and not make it work but yet here it does, and remarkably so.Credit to Tarantino because he really doesn't put a foot wrong here (aside from casting himself when he can't act). He delivers a great exploitation film that, much like Inglorious, allows the audience this bloody fantasy retribution with the underdog hero, but also has scenes of genuine tension, scenes of great dialogue and others of genuine hilarity – and most importantly none of them seem out of place. The length of the film put me off a bit because the cinema releases ahead of awards ceremonies all seem to run long as if that counts in their favor – but in the case of Django the time really flew. It helps that it is really well filmed too; the camera movement is powerful, the shot selection good and With such material to work the cast all give great performances – again despite so many of them having different aspects to deliver on. Waltz is a great presence, as he was in Inglorious – he fits the dialogue really well and captivates with his colorful character. Surprising to me was how much I liked Foxx – he downplayed when he needed to but yet was also able to step up into the exploitation hero when required. Di Caprio captures real smiling menace and again I was surprised by how well he did it. Samuel L Jackson isn't in the film till the final hour or so, but when he arrives he joins a very crowded screen of people all commanding attention – but his house slave is brilliantly loathsome and convinces as a man so long surviving that he has forgotten this is what he is doing. Washington has less time but she sells the emotional part of the film by being so convincingly brutalized. The supporting cast is almost too heavy in famous faces, but mostly they do not distract but rather add with their various turns.I was taken by surprised by how much I enjoyed this film and how the time flew. It mixes so much together that should clash and damage itself, but yet it all works really well (even the mixing of genre music and modern hip-hop!). I'm not always a fan of Tarantino's grind house and exploitation referencing, but here it works really well across the board.",Null,3,6,26 January 2013
Get Out," Enjoyably creepy and tense
","I heard good things about this film, but beyond that I really didn't know much about it - comedy or horror or a mix, that was about it. What I got reminded me of Black Mirror in terms of its tone and dark but yet slightly comic material. The plot starts with an oddly racial situation, where the family are well meaning and accepting, but at the same time not in a way where the black/white divide is not clearly present in some way. From here it starts to add gentle shifts of tension and a creeping sense of unease and dread across the plot. It is this element that works best because it provides engagement, leading to a reasonably short period of reveal and resolution - this final section working best because of the investment in the mystery side.The film is well paced to do this, and the plot is satisfying in the way that it uses race, but at the same time stands on its own feet without it being a theme if you don't see it or want it. First and foremost it is a horror, and it is an effective one. The cast work really well from top to bottom. Kaluuya leads the film well, and is convincing in all his moments. Williams is good, and holds her own alongside Whitford, Root, and Keener. Howery gets his performance just right - he could easily have been too much comedy, but he hits his marks importantly.Get Out is a smartly created horror/chiller where race is used as a strong foundation, but not in a way that the film forgets what it is trying to do.",Null,13,23,26 December 2017
Drive," An effective, engaging and stylish neo-noir that uses stillness and sudden violence really well
","I watched The American recently and I wasn't particularly taken by it. It tried to blend a standard thriller plot with a silent and arty reference to European cinema that just didn't really work. This came into my mind while watching Drive because, not only does it have a reference to a film being potentially called European, but it also manages to deliver an effective thriller within the skin of a 1980's modern crime noir skin. We join the action at the start where everything from the character's jacket, the theme music and even the typography and colour of the credits sets us in one of these films and it is a style that really sets the tone for the film.The style is important because a lot of the work is done there in terms of making this film what it is. The stripped down and silent delivery adds to the cool feel of the driving sequences but it also creates a stillness that translates really well into tension in the scenes where nothing happens, but something could happen. This becomes more obvious when the film becomes violent (and a couple of times it is very violent) because the realism of the situation is then always just beyond the stillness. The plot is fairly straightforward and could easily have been made as a direct-to-video crime movie with lots of shouting, lots of stunts and an ending where everything is tied up neatly. It is to the credit of the film that this very plot is turned into something that the majority of people would not have made.The story held me because of the manner of delivery. The score put me right into the frame of mind for a neo-noir type crime thriller and it held me in this state for the duration. OK some of the music is a little over used (the 'soft' music I have heard other places and it reminded me of them) but generally it is good. Refn's direction is equally cold and stylish – he sits back off his subjects in the main, giving them room in the frame, again adding a lot of visual silence which still looks good. He is helped by having a great cast because, as this is about delivering in the construct, presence is important and you need people who can do work with less. Gosling is getting lots of praise but personally I wasn't blown away – although he was good. He is cool and easy to like but brings out his darker side well (albeit rooted in kindess). Mulligan also does well because the two of them together convince of an affection that we have to buy into even though little is said. Cranston is a solid turn but perhaps suffers from now being too famous for his current TV role. Brooks and Perlman are both enjoyable tough and mean in different ways, their screen presence benefits their roles. Hendricks is in a small role but effective.Drive is a great little film that gets by on its style and delivery to make for an engaging and cool film. I watched Transformers recently and didn't like it for the same reason – it was all style and nothing of substance, so what is the difference? For me the difference is that with Drive the style informs the story and the characters, rather than just for the sake of it. Drive will not be to everyone's tastes (go to the message board for tales of those expecting something like Fast & Furious) but it is an effective, engaging and stylish neo-noir that uses stillness and sudden violence really well.",Null,4,9,23 October 2011
Bolt," An enjoyable family adventure
","Bolt and his owner Penny are superheroes, thank to a treatment from Penny's dad, Bolt has powers greater than your average dog and endlessly has to use them in big action sequences. Or at least, this is what he thinks. The reality is that none of it is real and it is just a TV show, with the facade kept up to ensure Bolt gives a great 'performance' each week. Chance separates Bolt from Penny though and sees him accidentally shipped to the other side of North America. Once free from his packaging 'prison', Bolt surmises that this is the work of his nemesis and sets out to locate and rescue Penny. The other animals he involves in his quest meanwhile, wonder how to break the news to him that he is, well, just a dog.There is a downside associated with Pixar making so many good animated films and that is that the bar is raised so high that 'good' films are judged harshly against criteria that they weren't really setting out to achieve. This happened to Bolt, although it fairness it doesn't help itself in the comparison stakes by essentially being the Buzz Lightyear part of the Toy Story films. It ended up being criticised for its lack of depth for adults and how the sentiment is just that, rather than emotion. This is perhaps unfair because Bolt came out in the same sort of year as Wall-E did, the latter film dominating all before it and rightly so.What Bolt delivers is a plot that allows for comparatively simpler emotion that is just about enough for adults without being too much for children, the message is simple and it is delivered well. The majority of the film though is about comedy and action. It opens with a greatly inflated action sequence from one of the bolt TV episodes that shows good awareness of the action-movie genre and entertains as such. From here it goes the familiar path of self-realisation along Bolt road trip back to Hollywood and this aspect is perhaps not as complex or as engaging as it could have been but at least it is entertaining. Most of this comes from the side characters as Bolt himself drives the plot more than the laughs. The animation is impressive of course and the direction is good, again with its visual references to other things and also the delivery of shots that would not be possible in 'real' action. I saw it in 2D so I can't comment on the 3D effects.The voices are good although the stars don't really steal the show as they can do. Travolta isn't anything special but does the job as Bolt without bringing a lot to the character that isn't delivered by the animators. Cyrus is OK and gets to sing the song in the film as well. Essman and of course Walton are the real good turns though, mostly due to them having the better material  likewise the pigeons, who are all good characters. McDowell, Bader, Lipton and a few others add colour but have smaller roles.Bolt is not Wall-E and in fairness it should not be judged by that yardstick. However, what it is is an enjoyable family film that delivers a good plot, great animation and regular laughs  and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.",Null,2,5,9 March 2009
Frozen," Not all you've heard but still enjoyable even though the musical aspect is a bit too Glee 'big smiles, lots of teeth' showy for me
","It was late in 2013 when Frozen came out and it was a year later when I finally got to watch it, although it did not feel like it was a film that had come out so long ago because it does seem to be everywhere: endless DVDs of it in homes with children, songs on CD in cars for children, sing-along versions released into cinemas for this Christmas, and many other things that make it feel very recent and relevant. This success is hard to put to one side, but I did, and I did not go into Frozen expecting it to be the film that so many fans claim it is; which is the right way to go because this is not the perfect film some claim, even if it is really quite good in many areas.The plot is one of them. The film starts a little awkwardly as we are introduced to two sisters, one of whom has magic ice powers, the other does not – we are asked to go with this and the events that follow because they set up the plot. Once over these rushed establishing scenes, the film settles down to be a story of two sisters; the romantic threads involving men are of course a big part of the story, but mostly it is about these two female characters – they are the leads and the story revolves around them rather than who they may or may not love. I like this as a theme and I also liked that it wasn't done as a overreaction – with male characters or any romantic subplot rejected, just that the writing was balanced and felt natural.The story plays out well. I was surprised that the comedy was lighter than I had expected, with fewer laughs throughout the film, mostly from Olaf. As a musical I could see why the songs and the setpieces have been so popular, but also why they didn't work for me so well. There is a real sense of Glee (the show, not the emotion) in all the songs and performances, with several of the bigger numbers reminding me of the type of things you see on America's Got Talent and shows of that ilk. This makes for big showy numbers, but also feels a tad over the top for my taste; catchy and 'big' for sure, but very specific to what they are doing. They worked though, and I didn't feel they were out of place in the film, just had to admit that they were not really to my preference. In the end it stands as an enjoyable film, with a good blend of story, musical numbers, action, and comedy. Is it as good as the popularity since release suggests? Probably not, but for the limitations of what it does, it does still work.",Null,3,6,3 January 2015
2012," The effects are there but the film has no real heart or tension to it
","The Mayans saw it coming long way off, but science has only just caught up as scientist Adrian Helmsley discovers that solar flares are having a physical impact on the Earth – heating up the core. It is getting worse and the only outcome will be the total collapse of land mass in just a few years. The politicians keep it quiet and begin planning for some form of survival of key people (and some from the private sector) while the remainder will have to be left to die as the species survives. As the physical signs of the end start increasing, one-time author and current limo driver Jackson Curtis is out with his children for the weekend and begins to put things together himself to get to a terrible conclusion.This was a big movie in the cinema and it continues to be so on video thanks to a massive advertising budget and like many others I was always going to watch it whether I fancied it or not. The film makes no bones about what it is and we are in on it from the very start. What we have here is another big budget disaster movie where lot of things are destroyed in detail before our eyes, while the narrative follows a small group of people as they try to stop/escape/survive the destruction. At its best this genre works by being thrilling and impacting but, when it is not working perfectly it is, well, 2012. The money is all up there to be seen and we have endless narrow escapes, lots of cars and buildings falling down and lots of spectacular forces of nature on display. Problem is though that all of it is computer generated and it is done in such a way that it lacks real heart or soul and never feels real. It also doesn't help that the narrow escapes and our heroes' ability to survive most thing stops us caring because there isn't really any genuine tension or excitement to be had.The plot has a stake in this too because it does what you expect from the very start. Of the main characters we focus on, the rich man was always going to get his while the 'normal' family survive (along with the dog, which always has to survive in this sort of thing). The predictability of it hurts it but it is hurt moreover by what it is doing – OK so the normal family that we have been following are together and safe (thanks to the cruel and pointless removal of Jackson's ex's current partner) but they are the only ones who have not been powerful, 'important' or rich enough to survive – we are meant to feel some sort of 'fairness' as we watch the Russian Oligarch fall to his death but even if the film tries not to mention it – the arks are full of more like him while billions of others (which includes everyone watching this film) have been left to die. Asking me to feel things is not a good idea when you've got this scenario and the film would have done better to not have had an emotional core.The cast cannot do anything of real value in the face of the technological onslaught. Cusack is an OK normal guy but this just makes it less believable, not more. He is not strong enough as an actor to make me care about his character or his family though, but then nor is Peet or McCarthy (although Wire fans perhaps will not be too upset by his fate). Ejiofor is far too good an actor to be here while Platt, Newton and Glover have very little to do – although at least they are not embarrassing in the way that Harrelson is. It is not really an actor's film though so I should not be too hard on anyone in particular but they did just take their money and do the basics.2012 is not an awful film but it is a very base example of the genre. It delivers the effects and the noise but none of it has any heart or reason to be thrilled by it and the details of the plot is not only predictable but also rather irritating (the 'happy' ending is that the rich and powerful survive while the normal overwhelmingly die). Make it an hour shorter then maybe it would be worth a look for spectacle but there is too little here to carry the near 3-hour running time.",Null,5,9,21 April 2010
The Number 23," Has potential but the foundation of nonsense is never overcome
","Lowly dogcatcher Walter Sparrow has his life changed when he comes into contact with a self-published novel by a mysterious author. Reading it, Walter finds eerie parallels between his life and the writer (Topsy Kretts  no, really) but more than that he finds that the fictional observations may well be true. The character in the novel claims to have stumbled across the evil power of the number 23  finding it woven into all aspects of life. Walter starts out just interested in the story but as he looks into this claim he finds it to be true and quickly becomes obsessed with getting to the bottom of it all.I like a good conspiracy-type film I do. My cynicism and bitterness sets me up to easily accept something much bigger than me ultimately working against me in ways that I cannot ever defeat. Sadly The number 23 is not a 'good' film by any means and, although it all looks slick and professional, it is really very weak when you take away all the protection of budget and packaging and look at it in the cold light of day. In fact, it doesn't even take the cold light of day to expose 23 for what it is because it is hard to take it seriously when you are watching it. The problems are all the way from the very idea through the script because it never convinces and indeed scenes where the number is discussed ('32  or 23 reversed') are just ridiculous and I was never able to get passed this and get into the mystery any more than this.It is a shame because deep down there is a nice idea here and I like the gradual twist but the delivery doesn't make the most of it. Perhaps lost in the silliness of it, the film cannot make the number thing work, even when it sort of becomes a side issue (in some small way). It all looks good and I thought the visual design of the film was quite impressive  as was the device of having Walter putting himself within the novel as he read it; not only does it make things easier for the viewer but it also points to the root of the obsession. Carrey is actually OK here despite my worry that he would be really badly miscast. He works and even while the audience is snickering, one can believe that at least he believes if even if nobody else does. Madsen was better than I expected although generally she was best 'within' the novel bits. Huston hangs round the edges failing to do much though.Overall then this is a professional enough film that is slickly put together and has potential in every way if only some other device other than that bl00dy stupid number had been selected as the focus. As it is, the idea of destructive obsession is lost as many viewers will be too busy shouting 'nonsense' at the screen while the script tries and fails to grip the audience with a thriller based on such tosh.",Null,12,23,30 April 2008
Velvet Goldmine," More a snapshot of a period than a story, but energetically enjoyable
","Ten years to the day after glam rock star Brian Slade staged a fake assassination live at a show and then vanished from the public eye, journalist Arthur Stuart is sent to do a `where are they now' piece on him. Unable to trace the man himself, he starts to interview old friends but, while building up a full picture of the past, his own role in the story begins to come back to him despite his best efforts to forget.When I first saw this film I was overly critical of the fact that the story was pretty thin despite a reasonable narrative potential.  However I was missing the point of the film.  While it does have a basic premise that is very much a glam version of Citizen Kane, this film is far more about the time and place and experiences rather than any specific story.  The plot works on the idea of a fictional version of fact and it works well.  It is of course exaggerated for effect but it works better for it.  The 70's are before my time (or rather I was born during them) but the effect of the film is to create a lasting impression that even young audiences can buy into - although it is apparent that the film is aimed at those who were teenagers during the time; and indeed those who were seem to like this film.The film is energetic and very enjoyable with an OTT pace and delivery. This makes it very easy to get into as it basically sucks you along.  At times it seems to be trying to shock (certainly a graphic suggestion in one scene where a school boy awaits buggery could have been removed or toned down), but for the majority of the time the excessive lifestyle and ideals only help to portray the sense of time and place better.  The direction is pitched to this and is flashy despite being a bit hollow; he manages to capture the glittery wonder of the time and his bias is not that bad a thing as he does show the bad side of the period (albeit in a pretty non-judgemental light).  The music is even better and it is that I enjoyed the film most for!The cast is pretty mixed and don't all succeed - mostly because the film is not a character piece or even, really, a narrative - it is more of time and place.  As a result the cast mostly play wide characters or could almost be accused of doing impressions.  Rhys-Meyers' Bowie-like star is good but is very much an impression.  McGregor is very good and his character is good. Izzard is tremendous fun in a wide character but has too little screen time. Bale has the responsibility to fit it all together and he does pretty well considering that the film doesn't serve him as well as it could have done. That said, he still does a good job of being the everyman teenager of the time.  Support from Collett, Woof and the like is good and they do well with what they have.Overall this is not a film to come to expecting a fantastic plot, but it is one to come to for a feel of the period, energy and good music as well as a talented cast.  It may be very much a matter of taste (and perhaps age) but I found it to be slick enough, interesting enough and, despite my age, easily enough identified to be enjoyable.",Null,2,5,18 January 2004
Ghost Rider," Roundly mediocre film that never really engaged me
","As a teenager , Johnny Blaze naively makes a deal with the devil in order to cure his father's cancer. When his father is cured but dies in a motorcycle stunt, Johnny lashes out at the Devil but ultimately accepts his fate. As an adult he has forged a great career for himself as a motorcycle stuntman thanks to his strange inability to be killed in any of his outrageous stunts. However when the Devil's son Blackheart comes to conquer the world, the Devil chooses his moment to summon Blaze as his 'Ghost Rider'  his demonic messenger  to stop him.At no point did I really expect this film to be any good but I did hope that at least it would be quite entertaining and thus I hired it on DVD. I wasn't prepared for quite how mediocre it would be though and I found myself losing interest more and more as it went on. The plot is the source of the problem as it does seem to plod along without any real sense of event or spectacle. At times it has its moments which are quite impressive (and were used heavily for promo and trailers) but it is the rest of the film that doesn't offer a great deal. The story doesn't grip or engage and it is quite dull at times; it doesn't help that there are no characters (good or evil) to really care about or root for and what I found myself left with was just a lot of special effects that play like cut scenes from a video game.The effects are technically impressive but they do lack heart and I felt almost no 'wow' factor on any level. At first it seemed cool but it got old quickly. It night have avoided this by making Blaze more of a person before he became an effect, but this doesn't happen. This leaves all the action quite cold in the delivery and I wasn't actually that bothered by it since I had never been bought into the story. Cage isn't able to find a character and just ends up delivery a rather obvious performance. He also fails to make his Rider have much in the way of character  it was never going to be easy but it didn't help to be stiff and unconvincing even before your head turns into an effect. Fonda is a reasonably nice bit of casting but has limited impact. Bentley lacks presence and threat as the Devil's son, which again undermines the action and story. Mendes suffers from a lack of material and we learnt here that she can only get so far with her playful brand of sexiness; true she is the most fun part of the film and she is a great presence but she has little to do and no real character to speak of.Overall then, a pretty mediocre and lacklustre film. It does the basics and has solid effects but where is the heart? Where are the characters or indeed any strong emotion of any sort whether it be love, hate, desire, vengeance or anything? Without any of these I'm afraid that the film pretty much fails to spark at any point.",Null,1,4,13 August 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Could have been stronger in the detail but is still a superior summer blockbuster
","When an American pharmaceutical company carrying out research on one very unique mutant discovers a method of producing a 'cure' for the mutant x gene, the effect on the mutant community is dramatic. Some embrace the drug in order to become 'normal', others protest the view that they have a disease that needs curing while others take a stand, seeing the drug as the first strike in a war. On the side of diplomacy are Professor Charles Xavier and his school for mutants; on the other is Magneto who is drawing his own army around him. The sides start to form while, although the government claims the drug will be voluntary, a weapons grade version is supplied to the army.The second sequel in the X-Men series has a title that suggests that it is perhaps the last. This may or may not be the case but the story suggests it is and it is as good a way as any to tie up what has generally been a collection of superior summer blockbusters. I was worried about the loss of Bryan Singer and even more so about his replacement with Brett Ratner but whether or not this is the cause of some of the weaknesses I can't say. I'll get onto my problems with it in a minute but they are not insurmountable and I actually really enjoyed the film on the level that many summer movies pitch themselves  special effects driven entertainment and action. However with this film (and indeed the series) there are more than just the bangs and the material offers much food for thought. In terms of the former aspect the action is great fun, looks great and is well spread out over the whole running time.Unfortunately the promise in the material isn't produced that well to compliment the action. The lines are blurred in this drama  we can see points in both mutant camps that we agree and disagree with while we also understand the human response. The ethics of it is well presented and is added to with lots of other plot lines and character issues  although this might be the problem, it is trying to do too much in a short time and, as a result, doesn't excel in any one thing even if it does many reasonably well. Having said that though, it is still much more interesting than many summer action movies I've seen over recent years. As director Ratner always seems more comfortable with the big action scenes and therefore doesn't offer much help to the interesting stuff in the script; this wasn't a surprise and at least he is good at what he does well.The cast is perhaps a bit too baggy (although the story helps solve that problem to a degree) but everyone is good. McKellen and Stewart are as reliable as ever in their characters and bring a lot of dignity to their material. Jackman is good but perhaps over familiar with his character  still good though and a solid lead. Berry has a small role with little to do and she is very much in the shadow of Janssen who is interesting even if her presence is part of the film having too much to do. Grammar is well cast. Paquin is the best of the young cast  others like Ashmore, Page, Stanford and others are OK but are less memorable.Overall this is a good summer action movie with good material, performances and action. It maybe isn't as strong as it could have been in different hands and with a tighter focus, but it is still a superior summer blockbuster and a strong end (?) to a generally strong series.",Null,6,10,14 June 2006
The Lives of Others," Mature, engaging and thoughtful drama across many aspects
","In 1984 East Germany is ruled by the Stasi, the secret police whose goal is to know everything and root out any signs of disloyalty to the ruling party. Whenever writer Georg Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria are placed under suspicion the Stasi are put on surveillance duty over his whole life, the task being given to one of their most trusted and experienced men, Captain Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler learns of the true motivations behind the surveillance and at the same time finds himself more and more drawn into the lives of Sieland and Dreyman from his unseen vantage point.The few critical remarks on this page have mainly focused on one aspect of the film  its pace. I will concede that the film moves quite slowly and that those looking for 'Enemy of the State' type thrills will be disappointed. However this is more to do with them as viewers rather than the film because for the majority of us the 'slowness' will be patience and the lack of action set pieces just leaves more room for character and plot development. What it then manages to do is all the more surprising for being the directorial debut of writer/director von Donnersmarck, the outcome is a solid and satisfying story that may not make everything clear as day but in not doing this it actually respects the viewer rather than disappointing them.At essence the story starts about the surveillance mission but, much in the same way as Wiesler is drawn in, the viewer find the attention then split between the characters, all of them on quite an equal footing. The themes of power and 'good' are explored within the characters in ways that I found to be interesting, challenging and very well done. It is usually a mark of a good film that one is still thinking about it a few days later (well, apart from some films that are so bad I'm still thinking murderous thoughts about them days later!). Donnersmarck has done very well as writer to build the themes into the nature of the characters and their stories so that repeat viewings or reflections on the film provide more of interest. His direction is strong as well, producing strong shots that stick in the memory and also make good use of the sets.The cast are roundly good. Mühe is the main one that people draw attention to and rightly so as his grey little man manages to fascinate with few words or direct actions. Gedeck is good but in a different way as her character carries much more of the weight in regards the pressure of the Stasi and also the thoughts over the morality of her character  she brings these out well. Koch is not quite the presence I had wanted as I found him a bit bland but yet still serviceable in the character. Support is suitably menacing from Tukur and Thieme and the cast doesn't really have a weak link in it.Overall then an excellent and mature film that deserves the praise and the awards it has garnered. Those complaining that it is 'slow' are correct in their statement but I do not agree with it as a criticism  just an observation of the pace. Instead the steady delivery allows for the gradual development of characters, story and themes that are surprisingly rich, engaging and ultimately satisfying. One of those films that provides food for thought for some time after viewing.",Null,2,4,17 March 2008
Hellboy," Had potential to be a really dark adult film and, despite being a bit entertaining, fails to deliver in most ways
","During WWII, Hitler turned to the dark arts to try and turn the tide, leading the Allies to create a paranormal unit to combat his attempts. An attempt by Rasputin to open a portal to another world is foiled by Bruttenholm and US solider  but not before a strange devil creature has come through into our world. Decades later, Hellboy (as he was named) has aged slowly into his early twenties and, under the guidance of Bruttenholm, has become a secret force for the government in their fight against demons. A new agent starts as Hellboy's handler and is immediately thrown into the deep end with the arrival of a beast in a museum. However this is only the start of a bigger plot by Rasputin and his immortal Nazi allies in their attempts to destroy the world.As most people seem to be at the moment, I quite like comic book films  I like the potential for action but also the complex characters that the better adaptations will bring out. For this reason I was keen to see Hellboy even though the trailer was filled with CGI and bad kiss-off lines  I should have trusted the trailer. The film starts well with the background for us uninitiated and then skips to the modern day. Using the standard 'new partner' idea as an 'in', the film then pretty much walks the usual tracks of romance, action, monsters and so on. The script never really allows the adult side to come through very well  there is nothing complex here and the dark side that I had hoped for seems to only exist in the sets and costumes.Without this I was left with just another summer comic book film and, sadly, not one of the better ones at that. The action looks OK but strangely failed to engage me  partly down to the overuse of CGI but also due to the director not injecting enough pace and urgency into them. The effects look OK but it is telling that the CGI beasts are not as impacting as Kroenen who is a much better bad guy  I think he should have been a bigger part and that that CGI been used more sparingly. Likewise, the characters are not as well developed or as interesting as I'd have liked. Hellboy himself is a fairly ordinary action hero  aside from the red skin etc, he has a cigar, is muscle bound and makes wisecracks; hardly breaking the mould is it? Liz and Myers are not used well at all, with their supposed romance not working; meanwhile other characters are just bodies rather than anything else.It is a shame because it was in the characters that I expected something more grown up to be delivered rather than just more effects and I did feel let down by the lack of this. It is still noisy and big enough to survive in the blockbuster world but I was surprised to see it already have a sequel planned. The cast will be happy with this, even if I was not entirely happy with them. Perlman is a good choice for HB and he does well in a rare leading role  it is not his fault that he has little to work with for the most part. Evans and Blair are fairly bland and uninteresting  partly the scripts fault but also a bit theirs too. Hurt's father figure is interesting, and Pierce delivers what is essentially an underwater Niles. Strangely he was not listed on the credits  unsure why he wasn't. The support cast is less interesting  the bad guys are no more than bad guys and only Beran is good value in his minor role. Tambor is not that well used but his presence is a good influence.Overall, maybe worth seeing once but, for all its potential it doesn't really stand up against the couple of much better comic book adaptations that are around (Spiderman 2 for example). The action is noisy but uninvolving and unexciting while the adult themes and characters just fail to materialise. Unless it sorts out these pretty major problems in part 2 I would seriously doubt it will have another chance after that.",Null,23,49,9 September 2004
Good Will Hunting," Entertaining piece of sentimental Hollywood tosh
","A rags to riches story where a working class boy is a mathematical genius who prefers a working class existence of bar rooms, fights and ball games to an academic life.  However when he is discovered by a professor at a trial for public disorder he is released into his care to have tuition and therapy.  Sean Maguire is brought in for the therapy while Will and his friend Chuckie go on with their normal lives.This is a quite hyped film (the rise of scriptwriters Damon and Affleck was already along the way before this hit - there's is not quite a rags to riches story for them), however there is much to enjoy here.  The story never fully explains how Will came to develop his talent or even how he came to know about it - was he born knowing everything about maths?  You feel that Will could have been given a little less arrogance - nobody knows everything.  However the story is quite interesting and it's given such a fairytale gloss that details are not important.The script also gives Williams a chance to do yet another tear-jerker role and get an Oscar for his troubles.  Affleck and Driver are also good in support but Damon is the lead.  His character has layers and he does have plenty of good scenes, but the main problem is that his arrogance is not shown as a negative trait and it tends to make him a little unsympathetic.Overall a good piece of Hollywood fairy tale gloss that does what it has to do - not a classic but it's a nice bit of sentimental tosh.",Null,6,12,4 January 2002
Room," Emotional and compelling stuff thanks to the tight focus on well written and performed characters
","Driven mostly by the initially intriguing concept, this film surprised me by resolving this around this mid-point of the film. Not having read the book or really heard anything specific about the film, it did catch me off guard in a small way, since I had come into the film with the specifics of the situation in mind. The first half of the film does make it more than this though, because I was drawn into a relationship which was emotionally raw and compelling. The film uses the limits of the room really well, focusing on the mother/son relationship and making us care about it while also being horrified by the specifics.The second half of the film manages to maintain that engagement, while flipping the characters in such a way that made the drama work in a much different way, and cast a different light on the first half of the film. It is tough in terms of subject matter, but at the same time it is easy to watch because of how well the film draws you into caring about the lead two characters. A big part of this is how well both Larson and Tremblay delivery; they are organic and natural performances, and are supported equally well by the likes of Allen and Macey. The writing and the performances make it, and in the end the film is a lot of heart and works as a result of this.",Null,2,4,2 July 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Has good aspects but generally doesn't seem to know what it wants to do and is only consistent in one aspect – its unevenness
","I'm not overly familiar with the source material but the name Walter Mitty does tend to mean something even to those that haven't read the story – and accordingly it is of a daydreamer, a man lost in his own thoughts and being ineffective. This film version of it using this as the starting point and from here we see our main character forced to overcome his inertia and take action and thus having the type of adventures that he would only experience by spacing out for a while. I remember seeing the trailer for this recently and both me and my partner came away with the same impression – we had no idea what this film was but for sure the trailer didn't make it look good at all. Sometimes this can be the case with difficult films though – because if the film isn't one clear thing, then perhaps marketing struggle to sell it and you end up with trailers that either present it as something it isn't, or just don't sell anything. As a result I decided to see it for myself.The answer is clear before you are too far into the film; the trailer doesn't know what to sell because the film doesn't know what it is. By turns it is a simple message to 'seize the day' to the target age audience of workers seeing their youth fade; but then it is also a travelogue of beautiful scenery in beautiful places; but then it is also a special effects film with big sequences of superhero fights and explosions; but then it is also much more introspective and character- focused; but then it is also a comedy with goofy slapstick and movie spoofs. All of this is in there in many different ways and almost none of it works when you put it next to another aspect – which is a problem in a self-contained 2 hour film. By the end the film felt so aimless and meandering that I wasn't sure why I should care Perhaps some people will be moved by the 'just do it' message, or the 'all ended well then' conclusion but these were so simplistic and unmatched with so much else that I really was left cold.Bits of it work in isolation and I did enjoy some aspects of the film, but the whole thing is uneven and seems to be lacking in consistency in its tone and its aims (if it even has any). I am all for films that can pull off a complex mix of ideas, emotion at different levels, tones, but this is not a film that pulls it off – this is just a film where a lot of things tend to exist very close to one another. The script seems to be the problem but I am not convinced that Ben Stiller knows what he is making here. His direction seems directionless outside of getting some great shots. This is even more evident in his acting; he delivers a performance that is whimsical and introspective but he does it in the middle of a film with nothing there to support that performance. Wiig is actually pretty good in a simple role, because she is pretty and likable without being so unreal as to become part of Mitty's fantasy herself. The rest of the cast are solid enough but again everyone is just acting out their scene in isolation.Maybe there is a beautiful, moving story in Conrad's script; it is impossible to tell here. The film will give you some laughs, it will give you some nice moments, it will give you some beautiful landscapes and it will give you some spectacle but it will not do anything consistently and this is what ultimately sunk the film for me. For once the movie trailer was accurate and honest in its reflection of the movie, because the film doesn't know what it is, and it doesn't work.",Null,5,9,17 January 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Vastly better than the first film - Jackson's Empire Strikes Back!
","The quest of the ring continues with the fellowship broken up.  Aragon, Gimil and Legolas pursue the orcs who took Merry and Pippin.  However they lose the hobbits when the orcs are attacked and killed by Eomer, nephew of King Theoden.  Merry and Pippin escape into the forest, meeting the keeper of the forest, Treebeard.  Aragon et al follow their trail into the forest to meet Gandalf the White who leads them to defend Rohan where Saruman's forces are preparing to attack and wipe out man.  Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, addicted to the ring and corrupted by it's power. They reluctantly allow Gollum to lead them to Mordor despite Sam's mistrust. Gandalf frees King Theoden from Saruman's spell and the King takes his people to the fortress at Helm's Deep where the armies of man and orc will collide.The plot sounds plain confusing.  And looking in the film magazines at the various maps and family trees that they published I did fear that the film would be even more demanding than the first and would almost require me to start ploughing through the book's appendices to follow it.  But no, that's the first thing Jackson has done well.  He has stripped down the detail and has made the relationship easy to see and the characters easy to understand. I'm sure much of the text has been lost but it works better.  On top of this the film's pace is much more even.In my review of the first film I disliked the stop/start nature of the talking/running plot and found it tiring and hard to enjoy.  Here the film manages perfectly with a good level of action and story that is consistent and builds to the battle for Helm's Deep as it's climax.  It makes for an enjoyable film rather than the pacing of the first.  Even the fragmented story line is dealt with well - it could easily have pulled the plot in 3 different ways and affected how the film hangs together but it really worked out well.  All three stories are told but none is lingered on longer than needed (with the possible exception of flashbacks of Aragon's love).This made it much more enjoyable to me - that the film was fun to watch and not hard work.  Also the comedy was inserted nicely.  Again the first film felt like it would be rude to enjoy this sacred story - but here we have nice laughs that don't cheapen the story or the characters.  The action is less chaotic than before and only the odd scene is a blur.  The special effects are excellent despite looking computer generated beside real things. The riskiest effect is Gollum - he could easily have been another Jar-Jar Binks in the way he didn't work well as a real character.  However the animation is superb.  Sure he doesn't always LOOK real beside Frodo and Sam but that's cause he's not!In terms of character Gollum was the best addition to the cast.  He is a real character - pathetic yet dangerous, funny yet treacherous.  After a few minutes I forgot that he was an effect and was as involved with him as with any of the others.  In fact the extent to which Serkis made Gollum watchable was shown by how held I was by his scenes with Frodo.  I found Wood to be too serious and worthy and hard to watch - Serkis' Gollum changed that and I was gripped.  The other good character is Astin's Sam who appears minor but is really the honest heart of the fellowship thus far, he is well acted and not allowed to be just a clumsy sidekick.  Pippin and Merry have minimised time which is good but their scenes are better this time round. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davis are all great and any scene they are in holds the attention effortlessly.  Mortensen is especially good and I can't understand why people prefer Bloom over him!?  Generally the acting is very good.  In the first film everything felt very tight, like the actors were afraid of upsetting anyone and read every line like it was gospel. Here they fit their characters better and seem to enjoy it which in turn helped me.Overall I pretty much enjoyed the first film but had big reservations about it - having to work to enjoy it and finding the pace tiring and ill-judged. In this outing all my reservations had been dealt with.  Sure it's not perfect but it is a very, very good film.  Epic in every sense but yet enjoyable and (thank God) fun to watch.  Just like Lucas improved Star Wars with Empire, so too has Jackson done much better second time around.  Lets just pray that The Return of the King doesn't turn out to be his `Return of the Jedi' - nope! It's unlikely - I can't wait!",Null,12,27,30 December 2002
Schindler's List," Powerful and moving if not exactly a fun night in!
","As Nazi Germany invades Poland, opportunist Oscar Schindler sees a chance to open a factory serving the military and using Jews for labour.  However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony.  It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves.  When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on.  This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally.  Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting.  True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much.  In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I.  Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky).  Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn.  A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen.  The support cast are all excellent right down to extras  if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones!  I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent. Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws.  A powerful, moving film that is moving for all the right reasons and not just because John Williams cranks in.  Difficult to watch but worth the effort.",Null,28,47,23 March 2003
Across the Universe," Despite visual invention, it lacks heart and ends up coming off like an expensive piece of pretentious amateur dramatics
","Liverpudlian dock worker Jude travels to the US in the 1960's to find his estranged father. Once there he meets Max, which in turn leads him to fall for his sister Lucy. While Lucy and Jude move through the 1960's involved in the peace movement, Max is drafted and ends up in Vietnam.So let me get this straight. I cannot buy The Beatles' music on iTunes but yet somehow permission was given to use that music in this film? If I'm right in that then the message from the owners of the rights is this: access to the original music = bad, music used in corny amateur dramatics = good. I know that is a bit of a simplification but it is difficult to see how this film came about in regards getting the rights to the music it so heavily uses. I can understand why some people love this film because it is visually creative and it aspires to create a large musical and artistic experience in charting America during the 60's and 70's all via the central love story of Jude and Lucy  few would deny that the film lacks ambition. However ambition is not the making of a film and the problem is here that it is not enough to carry it through all the problems.The film lacks heart. I know many will disagree having been caught up in the creativity of it all but then some people cry and corny school plays so disagreement should not be taken as fact. The characters are one-dimensional and they get lost in the grand sweep of the film. So, OK, perhaps the film is carried on the grand sweep of history and the bigger picture? Well no, because this history is simplified down to Broadway song and dance numbers and none of it has resonance in the way one knows it should. As a result of this the cast are mostly left without anything to work with other than making sure they hit their musical cues and stand in the right spot for the camera. What this ends up meaning is that the entire film feels like high school amateur dramatics where everyone is slightly cheesy but very sincere, the songs are familiar but not as good as the original and the numbers all have a 'lots of teeth and glad-hands' feel to them.The film is visually creative in its imagination and its reference points but without heart this again makes it feel am-dram and, in combination with the treatment of the subject, all a bit pretentious. By the end of the film I was grateful for release because it had offered me nothing. I didn't care about the characters, I didn't get drawn into the musical numbers, the sweep of history was delivered with too little meaning and only the pretty pictures distracted me  but they were hollow as a result of the other failures. Across the Universe is generally well-liked on this site, I genuinely have no idea why because, visuals aside, the film plays like an expensive and pretentious piece of amateur dramatics.",Null,1,6,16 February 2009
The Incredibles," Great film but forgets who its audience is
","Fifteen years ago the world was a different place; superheroes moved among and were constantly acting to keep us safe from danger and crime. However when Mr Incredible saves a man from coming suicide, he is sued for doing so, sparking a series of lawsuits against other superheroes. With the Government picking up the bill and public opinion turning against them, the superheroes retire into normal life incognito. Now, Mr Incredible lives with this wife and kids as Bob Parr, working in an insurance office and spending evenings with his friend Lucius (formally Fro-Zone) pining for the old days of daring-do. So when a mysterious offer of work as a superhero comes up, Bob jumps at the chance; but is everything as it seems on the mysterious island? Having left it as long as possible before going to the cinema to see this film in order to avoid the place being full of children, and I timed it reasonably well with the cinema only having about 40 other people in there and only about 15 children. The film opens well with some good action scenes and setting the historical frame for the story we are to be told  the wonderfully convincing soul-destruction of an 'ordinary' life. It paints this very well and uses it to get into a bigger story about Bob's loss of manhood and achievement that could have easily been about a middle-age realisation of the loss of youth as much as about as the glory days in regards superpowers. It is pretty adult and dark throughout and for me this is its main failing, in that it seems to forget that all the marketing for this thing has been fired at kids and most screenings will have very young children in it.Other Pixar films have got the balance spot on, but here we have a film that could easily have been PG for content but also has surprisingly little to keep children engaged. Most of them in my screening were shifting around or just sitting bored, with only a few laughs to be heard throughout the whole film. The content and material is much more suited to older children and adults but they are never going to do that with a film that can get the kiddie dollar and the pester power so why it wasn't made more suited for them is beyond me. However this is only a weakness if you have kids in the cinema with you, without them there is a lot of funny stuff, clever stuff and well written characters to get into; I did really enjoy the story and even found the action parts to be very exciting and very well done.Visually the film is great and Pixar have greatly improved their human characters  of course they are not photo-realistic but that is not the point. The backdrops seem set in a 1950/60's America of superheroes, although it is rather timeless. It references heavily to things like Bond, Fantastic Four and spy thrillers but it never turns into the sort of reference heavy joking that can (and I believe will) date so many animated features that live and die on the quality of their spoofs and in-jokes. The end credits are incredibly cool and I did wonder why they had saved such great artwork until then instead of the opening credits, unless it was to keep potential spoilers out of the front of the film. The characters are great fun and are very well written. Mr Incredible is a very human man who we feel for easily and the investment put into him covers the lesser job put in with his family. The film lacks the collection of good support characters that are often put in things like Toy Story etc but does have a great minor role in the hilarious Edna. Nelson does very well with the lead role; Hunter is impressive and even the children are pretty good even if Fox overdoes the 'all-American goodness' aspect of Dash. Jackson has a much smaller role than expected but is still very funny but I must admit that I found Jason Lee and his character to be annoying and unengaging  although I suppose it doesn't matter so much.Overall this is a very enjoyable film but it is not one that is aimed at children other than to make money out of them. The marketing may tell you it is but really the story, 95% of the laughs, the action and the design of the film all say that it is for older children and adults to really get the good out of  young kids will only like some bits and the noise, although I could see many being scared by it more than loving it. Well written, funny, exciting and consistently interesting for all sorts of reasons and yet another great film from Pixar.",Null,4,9,21 December 2004
The Mist," Effective and gripping modern horror (SPOILERS)
","A severe storm in the Maine area leaves a small town all getting supplies and equipment to repair their homes in case of another brace. The busy department store is thrown into confusion whenever a local man runs into it shouting about 'something' in the mist that has been sitting on the lake and mountains since the storm. Suddenly the town (and the store) is engulfed in the mist and screams can be heard from those caught in it. Nobody knows for sure what is happening although strange noises can still be heard from outside. An attack on the store by a hideous creatures leaves them in no doubt that they are in peril, even if the reasons are less clear  God's wrath, mass hallucination or what. As the noises increase, the tensions rise within the crowded store with factions forming and threatening to ignite the situation.If there is one thing that makes me approach a film with caution then 'Stephen King's' being before the title is one. Fortunately the reviews were positive enough to make me go along to check this out and, with some reservations, I'm glad I did. With almost no build up to speak of, the viewers find themselves trapped in the same department store as the characters with only the fact that we know this is a genre film to give us a bit more insight into what is out there in the mist. From this point what we get is an extended and professional film version of an Outer Limits episode where the monsters hidden inside the mist are of as much interest as the monsters hidden within the humans in the store. Darabont recognises that they are both of equal importance with his script and direction and some of the more scary moments are to do with the actions inside the store rather than those outside. This allows the tension to be raised on all fronts and it makes for an urgent and engaging horror film that skips across the two hour running time as if it was nothing.On paper the cast suggest this is a lesser film but this is not true so much as it being a lower budget affair. Jane is an effective lead and sells a lot of it  surprising to me since I've never been that impressed by him. Braugher was a bit of a disappointment to be in regards how little he does and how soon he leaves the film. Harden dominates the film with an really good performance that drives the film's subtext of criticism of religious extremism. She prevents it being hammy or aver-acted by the total realism she brings to it, you never take her less than seriously. Outside of these two it is very much an ensemble piece and pretty much everyone does just what they have to do in a cast that includes plenty of solid names such as Sadler, Holden, Owen, Jensen and others. As director Darabont does really well to keep things tense. The trivia section tells me he used the camera crew from The Shield and you can see the effect; technically I'm sure they are used to tighter schedules but the are also very good at making the camera a device to add the sense of urgency rather than just capturing images. Technically the weakness is in the effects, which is to do with the budget. However what helps this is that we never really get a good look at anything in particular and, when we do, there tends to be a lot of action to prevent us worrying about it.The film ends on a bleak note that prevents any sort of upbeat feeling. Personally I would have liked it to have ended without the final 'reveal' because I didn't think this offered as much as a bleaker, more open ending would have done (eg just Drayton walking out into the mist). This would have left us his anguish but also offered no wider hope for the world  as it is, his situation is diminished slightly in importance by the 'twist' being about the bigger picture. It does still work though and it leaves The Mist as an effective, bleak, interesting and scary horror movie. Goodness only knows why it did so little business in the US because, aside from some content that comes with the genre territory, this is a really effective and gripping film where the tension and horror comes from outside and inside with both given equal importance.",Null,4,9,13 July 2008
Driven," Fairly brainless stuff that may appeal to those just looking for effects and speed sans logic or realism
","Jimmy Bly is an up and coming name in Formula 1. He is leading the championship with rival Beau Brandenburg but the pressure is starting to take hold. To help out, team boss Carl Henry brings in old pro Joe Tanto to replace Bly's team mate Memo Moreno. Joe tries to reach Bly and give him the benefit of his experience off the track as well as his skills on the track. Meanwhile, off the track a tangled web of simmering romances, lost loves, friendships and past conflicts conspire to make the championship about more than the result of twenty races.This film seemed to do almost nothing in the UK cinemas but when it came to TV I caught it. I could vaguely remember a lot of talk about Stallone wanting to make a Formula 1 movie and as a semi-fan of the sport I knew he was often to be found hanging around the pits. This labour of love then, has created a film that is about as generic and obvious as you could want it to be. At the core of the story is a couple of old chestnuts about, well, an old chestnut teaching a rookie the ropes while the rookie undergoes a crisis of confidence. Obviously worried that these clichés wouldn't be enough, the writers load the film with lots of romances, conflicts and so on. Narrative-wise none of them really work since all of them are half-cooked and just designed to fill the time rather than do anything special.The action is what most viewers will be here for and I suppose it is at least noisy and 'high-octane'. Fans of Formula 1 in its 'pure' form will baulk at the overblown races and the absurd car chase and even those who find F1 dull will find themselves snickering at the silliness of the whole thing. With all this happening the cast are stuck in the middle. Stallone is a solid presence but is really just acting for his own sake rather than the film. Pardue is far too bland to care the film and seems to have little or no range to speak of. Schweiger has been told to 'do a Schumacher' and this is all he does. De la Fuente has heard a voice telling him to 'do a Van Damme' so this is what he does while a totally wasted Gershon molls beside him through gritted teeth. Warren is pretty while Reynolds doesn't convince in his scenes and looks like a man who has been pulled and tucked five too many times.Overall then this is movie-by-numbers time. There is nothing specific to watch it for really; the plot is delivered in basic blocks while the action may please some but is generally too overblown and silly to really engage or convince. Fun for Stallone to indulge himself while making it I'm sure but sadly nobody really seemed to be thinking about the audience that much.",Null,3,7,19 November 2006
I Am Legend," Excellent until it starts moving the narrative beyond a concept and stumbles and falls badly
","Cancer has been cured by genetically modifying the measles virus to benefit mankind  the results are impressive. However the downside is that the virus mutates killing 90% of humanity, turning 9% into light-phobic monsters and leaving only 1% untouched due to natural immunity. Robert Neville is one of that 1% and also the military biochemist charged with stopping the virus but he has failed and now is the only person alive in what remains of NYC. Working on a cure in his basement and broadcasting fruitlessly into the sky, Neville spends his days surviving and his nights hiding.Despite my fear of most zombie style films, I came to I Am Legend drawn mostly by the interest in the effects. Having been impressed by an empty London in 28 Days Later, I was curious to see what more money could do. In terms of impact the answer is 'the same' but in terms of scale it is 'much more'. New York looks amazing and even those who only know it from films will feel the emptiness of the place. The irony is that, due to the sheer scale of it, visually it looks 'unreal' whereas the smaller scale 28 Days Later was just plain eerie as it involved nothing generated by computer. This will sound like a criticism but it is not because I do think that this sense of emptiness is the thing that makes I Am Legend excellent for part of the running time.The effects are only part of it but roundly the delivery makes this aspect work. The plot sits back and lets us just be with Neville in his isolation and semi-madness; talking to manikins, treating his dog as a child and so on. This is greatly helped by a performance from Will Smith that is close to towering; he is utterly convincing in his character and the film brings us an understand of his situation gradually. As we get used to his eccentric lifestyle, the reality is brought home in a moment where he goes from sun to a sweat soaked scene in a dark room, a brilliant moment where we the audience experience the fear he is living with first hand.So why is the film itself not brilliant? Well, this comes down to the second half or so where the writers start to take steps to bring out a narrative that will go somewhere in the traditional sense rather than exploring the character of Neville as its sole reason for being. In doing this the script made many jumps that were convenient, illogical or just plain lazy and it is disappointing. Bear in mind that this is a film that had managed to convince me that the majority of humanity was dead due to Emma Thompson, the man responsible for finding the cure was one of the few left alive and that New York was completely empty  I never questioned any of this so how much of a dropped ball is it to suddenly introduce a narrative that has the audience looking at each other saying 'yeah right'? It is not as bad as I make it sound though because at this point the action steps up and provides sufficient noise and explosions that perhaps many viewers will find themselves distracted away from the problems with the story telling. However these are too obvious and too big and contrast badly with the patience and emptiness of the first half and, with the rush to a conclusion the film does really feel like the majority of the work was done on the concept and this plot was an afterthought. The writers don't help themselves with some of the dialogue anyway. Having got it so perfect with so little early on, a massive shoehorn is used to get Bob Marley in there  one of several things that conspire to undermine all the good character development that had been done in the first half.Overall though the film is worth seeing. The first half is very impressive thanks to patience, special effects and a very strong turn from Smith. Sadly the second half lets it all down as the plot devices used to provide a tradition flow and ending are clumsy and unconvincing and the noisy action sequences that are produced didn't manage to distract me from them.",Null,57,79,17 February 2008
A Quiet Place," Engagingly simple thriller although not quite gripping enough to make you blind to the odd weak point
","Much talked about, this near-silent film is set many months after humanity has been nearly wiped out by some form of creatures which hunt by sound. The Abbott family silently survive with their 3 children, and a fourth on the way; although the pressure to prepare for the birth and survive the day is significant. The simplicity of the film is its main selling point; beyond newspaper headlines there is no backstory or development of the situation but instead we have the rules and the stakes laid out very clearly in the first few minutes. Within this frame we have a family struggling to survive and stay together as a group despite terrible loss and situation; so it is making us care for the characters while also stripping out all the things that would take us away from them if we chased a bigger world picture.Mostly it plays it out very well, making for a tense and silent affair which doesn't resort to too many empty jump scares. Things get weaker as the film forces events and situations for the sake of drama, as well as being fine with plot holes/weaknesses that they need to make those things happen. The flooded basement is one example, but the ending is the one that bugs me most as it transforms the female lead character into something she isn't, and has an odd 'kick ass' tone to it that doesn't fit with the rest of the film. It is a shame because it is an enjoyable dark and lean film up till that point, but neither the handling of the baby or the ending really ring true within the context of the rest of the film. Good performances and well enough put together though - worth a look as long as you know it is not the classic that the hype suggested.",Null,1,1,9 March 2019
The Bourne Legacy," Takes a while to reset but is solidly good once it does – not up to the original films though
","I had no great hopes for this film when it was announced that they were extending the franchise after the third film and it was with low expectations that I sat down to watch it. To give credit to the writers I did like the way that they stepped back into the same world rather than picking it up later or earlier than the original films. The plot sees actions taken to kill off all those who could expose Treadstone (ie those directly involved in it) due to the actions of Bourne threatening to bring everything down around them. In this film we focus on another agent trying to escape elimination and as such it works pretty well in terms of how it folds into the other films.This allows it to be a rather inferior copy without having to deal with the accusations of it being one – because in essence it is a part of those films rather than a riff on them. The downside is that it does take some setting up; establishing new characters, linking them to the other Bourne movies, breaking it free from that narrative and then getting moving with this new thread – all of this takes time and it does show the strain within the first hour where it has a lot of words and very little action. This is a necessary evil but it does try the patience to a point in the first half of the film and at points through the second. A further downside is that it does stilt the flow of the film and when the action does come it feels rushed and that it doesn't have sufficient time to be consistent. It is still pretty thrilling once it gets moving but it is just the constraint of time and context – the ending also feels like a bit of an anti-climax as well, because we don't get the sense of the story going on from here (even though it clearly will). It does still work though and, although the action never gets to the standard of the previous films.I thought Renner was on a hiding to nothing by trying to fill Damon's shoes, but in fairness he does do a really good job; he has the presence and he uses it well and it is just the shame that it takes the film so long to become 'his'. Weisz is a classy bit of casting and the film benefits from her support – again just a shame that it takes so long for the film to be given over to her. Norton helps minimize this to some point by being the heart of the first half of the film and being a good presence throughout – he works well and I would like to see him and Renner closer in the sequel to this film.Overall Legacy isn't up to the standard of the previous films but it does still work pretty well. The writing is good even if it requires a lot of establishing before it can make the jump into this new film, but the starry and engaging cast help by virtue of their presences. It is in the shadow of the main films but it is still pretty enjoyable and I would be very happy to see this story be concluded in another film with the same cast and characters.",Null,4,7,30 December 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," An interesting true story made a good film with great performances
","Brooklyn, New York. Sonny, Sal and another man walk into the bank and hold it up.  Seconds into the job, the third man changes his mind and leaves. The job starts to go wrong when Sonny discovers that the truck he was told was dropping off money, was actually picking it up, meaning the vault is nearly empty.  Things get worse when the police arrive outside and trap the two inside with a handful of hostages.  As Sonny and Sal try to keep control, a circus breaks out on the street with the police, the public and the media all involved.I have seen this film several times but it has been a few years since I last had the chance to see it.  I watched it again today with the memory of it being good but not really as truly great as many seem to think it is.  The plot is all the more fascinated for it being true but it is not an easy subject to bring to the screen.  While morally most people can accept robbers in films as characters to support, it is a bigger step to accept the sexualities and complexities of these characters and to get behind them. However the film actually manages to make this quite moving and difficult - not only do we feel for Sonny but the film is fair to him and, more impressively, Leon. It would have been easy to turn this relationship into a joke but the script allows it to be done with sensitivity.  The rest of the film captures the sense of circus and media feeding frenzy well as well as being quite tense and enjoyable to watch.The film's strength is it's performances and, in particular, Pacino in a performance that is both showy and understated at different times.  He is a real person and it is to his credit that, no matter the revelations about Sonny, he never loses the audience.  Cazale is good here too but in a different way - a simple, sympathetic character.  His hit rate is amazing when you think that he was only ever in a handful of films and they were all pretty amazing, but it's hard to tell how good an actor he was really. Durning is good in support and the rest of the cast are pretty good but it is Pacino's film and he manages well with the shouting, the silence and the complexities of his characters.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is certainly a very good telling of this true story.  The film deals very well with both the tension of the situation but also the underlying stories and characters - even more surprising for the period it was made in, it makes a very balanced presentation of the homosexual characters.  The direction is very good and the performances are all good, but it is Pacino's film and he does very well with it.",Null,15,19,2 May 2004
School of Rock," Relies too heavily on Black but gets better near the end
","Dewey Finn is a middle-aged rock fan who hopes for big things with his band. However when one day brings both his band dropping and his flat mates threaten to kick him out unless he starts paying rent, he gets depressed. However when he pretends to be his friend Ned Schneebly he gets a job as a substitute teacher for a few weeks.  Determined just to hang in there and collect the money, Dewey changes his mind when he finds that his class can mostly play instruments and his thoughts turn to the idea of still winning the battle of the bands contest.The trailer looked energetic and funny, however the film isn't.  It seemed like a good idea - after all, Black's music obsessed character stole High Fidelity and his character here seems to be just an exaggerated and focused version of that one.  However the film then bases the majority of the film upon Black's abilities to drive it forward, and this is a problem.  The script is pretty weak and lacks any real belly laughs; it is amiable enough but it would be too generous to describe it as `funny'.  Only in the final quarter do things happen - before this it is just the basic pitch run over and over again (`guy teaches uptight kids to rock'), however the final 30 minutes is actually pretty good and, despite not really enjoying the majority of this, I still found the gig at the end to be pretty uplifting and enjoyable!Black is certainly a different leading man, but his performance here just grated a little bit after a while.  His overacting would have been more fun if it had been funnier - instead the material really lets him down.  It isn't that it is awful, it is just fairly average and unfunny for the most part - and the `energy' that was in the trailer isn't enough by itself. The cast of kids is actually very good - there are none that are horribly cute and they all give pretty good performances (although some are used better than others).  In fact had the film developed them more rather than pushing Black to the extreme fore it may have been better for it.  Cusack stands out in an amusing role in an adult cast that is really a distant third behind Black and the kids.Overall this film is disappointing and fairly poor for the majority.  When it finally does more than just deliver the pitch and actually has things happen it gets better, but by then it is almost too late.  I'll admit I was going to walk out after an hour as it just didn't seem to be going anywhere or doing anything, but I hung in there to find it got a bit better.  If you don't expect very much, and you're in the mood then this may well be enjoyable enough for you, but I was simply disappointed by how unfunny it was.",Null,4,21,7 February 2004
Kick-Ass," Entertainingly violent and care-free if not as smart or as funny as it wants to be
","Kick-Ass caused a fair bit of hand-wringing when it came out in the UK – and of course most of it was from the media outlets such as the Daily Mail where all their commentary only appears to have two modes – (1) hand-wringing and (2) smug superiority. Anyway, the issue appeared to be that this was a very violent film with very strong language and that it contained a child actor involved in all of it. On one hand one could question the decision by the parents to let a child do this even in play-acting, but to be honest the film is so gloriously over-the-top that it never takes itself seriously and is unlike to bring about the collapse of society that Tooky predicted in his review.This level of attack has unfortunately sparked the opposite extreme – where those that like the film feel they have to love the film and praise it as much as the detractors hate it. This is unfortunate because the film does not deserve to be either blamed for society's woes or to be praised to the high-heavens as if it were the most clever subversive film ever made. The truth is that Kick-Ass is very entertaining in an excessive and ridiculous way. Taken as a response to the darker comic-book movies of recent years, Kick-Ass revels in the ridiculousness of it all, having little pops at the genre clichés and taking everything to a silly excess. In doing this it is consistently funny and entertaining in a trashy way.The references will probably date it somewhat in time, but the nods towards other genre films and things such as Modern Warfare 2 will be appreciated by the target audience. The violence may be condemned for being excessive and gratuitous but doing so is a matter of taste since this is really the point of it – it is supposed to be OTT and it is weirdly enjoyable for it. I don't agree with those that would have this be something it is not though and it is not a film that makes full use of the potential to be smart and make comment. The potential is there though but if it does start out with some clever ideas, these are generally surrendered as the film goes along – it doesn't affect how entertaining it is, but it prevents it being as clever and as memorable a film as it could have been.The cast buy into the excessive nature of it very much and it is they that help carry it along. Johnson in the lead plays his geeky part well, although he was always going to be in the shadow of Mortez, who delivers with great presence and charisma throughout the film. True there is a strange air to seeing a child do what she does but this does not detract from her performance and it is not her fault the material did not make slightly more intelligent use of her character being in this excessive mode. Cage is the big name and is he good playing it for gentle laughs – his imitation of Adam West when in character is a great touch. Supporting is roundly good (and within the tone of the rest of the film) from Strong, Mintz-Plasse, Rispoli and others.Kick-Ass is not the anti-Christ but neither is it the wonderfully brilliant film that others would claim as it doesn't deliver on the potential to be clever and to be subversive. However the resulting excessive comic-book movie is still very enjoyable and funny and if this is what you are looking for then it does deliver on that.",Null,7,15,17 May 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," Great story, great acting and great fun
","Danny and Peaches are two officers in the British army who find themselves at a loss when their services are no longer required in Asia.  While blackmailing a local Raj, the pair are exposed by author Rudyard Kipling and brought before an officer.  They are warned but released.  Later the visit Kipling to get him to witness a contract for their latest plan  to become kings of a small country by training a village to conquer the rest of the villages and then leave months later with riches.  The conquest begins in earnest, but when Danny's vigour in battle makes him appear to be a god to the villagers new dangers are introduced.I have seen two interviews recently with the two leads (separately) and both time clips of this film were shown that made me think `I must watch that again'.  Come Christmas and the repeats on all channels gave me the chance to see it.  I had forgotten just how funny the film is and it really helps the film to be an enjoyable adventure to add to the dark edges.  The plot is from a Kipling story so it is of a good stock and stands up well.  The addition of humour is well pitched and really helps.It is a great adventure story, with a cautionary twist in the tale and can be enjoyed on all levels.  The directing is as good as you'd hope from Huston but what really made the film for me was the two leads on top form. Both Connery and Caine have a great chemistry and totally convince as the old school military types.  They bring the roles to life and make them enjoyable and get us behind them effortlessly.  Admittedly most of the support cast are only jabbering natives who aren't allowed characters with the odd exception.  Plummer is good in a minor role but this is the Connery/Caine show all the way.Overall this is a great story that is well told by director Huston.  The film is made even better by the gentle camaraderie between Connery and Caine and the good vein of humour that underpins the strong story and quite downbeat climax to Caine's story.",Null,37,52,30 December 2002
Unknown," Solid thriller with solid mystery but lacks desperation and claustrophobia in the delivery
","It is a familiar scenario in films to find an ordinary man pulled into a crime bigger than him and unable to turn to the authorities. Hitchcock did it several times (39 Steps, Lady Vanishes, North by Northwest), Johnny Depp did it in Nick of Time and now Liam Neeson gets a run at it. The plot here sees him in Berlin when a car accident puts him in a coma for a few days. When he comes to (without ID) his wife seems to not know him and indeed already has a husband of his name, and who also has full knowledge of everything he claims to know as well. Starting to believe maybe he is crazy, he rapidly learns he is not whenever someone tries to kill him.Having already punched and kicked his way across most of Paris in Taken, here we get a less action-orientated film in Berlin and the outcome is not quite as fun as Taken although it is a bit more engaging in terms of plot and ideas. The viewer is held pretty well by events on the screen and most of us will have hoped for at least a semi-decent solution to the mystery. Personally I didn't see the solution coming and, although a bit so-so, it was still good enough to do the job and kinda make sense within the internal logic of the film. However since the solution is reasonable simple (comparatively) and comes quickly, the film does spend a lot of time hanging around in the mystery, doing not too much till the solution comes. There are chases and fights but where the film fails is a sense of the world collapsing around Harris. He doesn't quite have the desperation that Harrison Ford had in Frantic (for example) and it is less engaging and exciting as a result.It still goes through the motions though and some of it is enjoyable as a basic thriller but the sense of losing everything and being desperate to get to the bottom of it all is only ever spoken – not really ever felt. The direction from Collet-Serra is part of it; everything looks professional and money has been spent but he doesn't find the claustrophobia that he needed to find in his scenes and, when it comes down to what the film needed him to do, he is by the numbers, letting the plot do the telling, not his camera. Neeson is a solid oak again – he doesn't have a lot of flair but considering he is 60 next year he convinces in the action roles he has had recently; he cannot find his character's panic though, which is a shame. Kruger is solid in support, as is Jones and Quinn. I liked Quinn here as he had a good character and played it well (but will he ever get away from the YouTube thing?). Langella is a nice bit of casting as he does have a presence naturally.Overall Unknown is a solid thriller that goes by the numbers, provides the solid solution it had to find and gets out with car chases and guns in its wake. It lacks a real delivery that would have made it great though; it is delivered without any great sense of what it is doing and the director never gets the desperation and claustrophobia that the mystery really could have done with to engage the viewer. It is OK to watch, but watching was all I was doing.",Null,0,0,17 August 2011
Ghostbusters," Iffy effects, good comedy, great Murray  probably remembered as being better than it is
","Three scientists at Columbia University lose their funding and are kicked out of their premises.  A contact with a ghost puts them onto a business idea of operating as `ghost busters' in new York.  They make the equipment and set up shop in an old firestation.  With their first customer comes fame and roaring business.  However one of their customers is reporting something about Gorzer and the group realise that she may be the focus of a bigger supernatural phenomenon.Everyone who saw this when it came out will have fond memories of it  be it the comedy, the `great' effects or just the cheesy wonderful theme song.  It was a great blockbuster at the time but it hasn't dated that well in some respects.  However overall it is still fun to watch.  The plot is average at best but allows for plenty of comedy and action  which is all you want really isn't it?The bits that have dated are naturally the effects  the beastly dogs are pretty ropy to say the least but are forgivable.  This is more than made up for by the energy it has and the comedy.  The film is simply fun to watch  it may not be a classic but it is enjoyable and will make you smile.  Most of this is due to Murray (who replaced Belushi who the role was meant for). Murray has all the best lines and has the most fun character.  Aykroyd is a close second but Ramis is much better behind the camera.Support from Weaver, Moranis, Potts and Atherton are all good and the ghosts are enjoyable if a bit dodgy. Poor Hudson looks as out of place at times as he apparently felt.  He isn't part of the trio and strugged off-screen to fit in, while onscreen his distance is evident with him slightly off to the side on many occasions.Overall many remember it to be better than it is because we saw it as children.  Revisiting it as an adult may bruise those memories but I was relived to find that it was still very enjoyable to watch despite being a bit more superficial than I noticed back in 84!",Null,4,10,19 September 2002
Coyote Ugly," Formulaic story with dancing girls  like a titillating music video but 30 times longer
","Aspiring song writer Violet leaves her New Jersey home and moves into New York, full of hope that a record company will pick up her tape and start selling her songs.  When she realises the reality of the situation she has run out of money and luck.  When she overhears three girls talking about how much money they made in one night, she learns of the bar Coyote Ugly, where the barmaids are so lively and fun that they draw the crowds.  She gets a job there  but will it hinder her chances of getting her big break?I, like almost all men, enjoy the odd music video here and there  it's not hard to watch MTV for longer than 20 minutes and realise that all the videos know that sexy girls shaking their asses will get the viewers watching their songs.  This is fine because a) the song may be good so that it's not all visuals and b) it only lasts 3 minutes.  The problem with Coyote Ugly is that it is basically a long music video and has the disadvantage that neither a) or b) are true in it's case.  The plot is very formulaic and everyone and his dog knows where it is going from the outset.  For large chunks of the film nothing of merit happens  even a love interest is thrown in to try and fill the running time out.  This leaves plenty of scenes of girls in tight/skimpy clothes dancing on a bar, covering themselves with water etc which is all well and good if that's all you want.  However for me, and this brings us to b), I want more from a 90 min+ film  I can get that in a music video.The running time just drags at times and few of the scenes do anything to help.  Scenes of Violet writing on her roof are just uninspiring and it's only the ass-shaking that ever woke me up out of the stupor that the film had put me in.  The film is just another slick little meaningless product from the usual stable  it has no substance but has plenty of enjoyable visual images for men to watch.  I just needed more than girls to enjoy this.The cast are average at best.  Perabo is dippy in the lead but is likeable enough to do the job.  Garcia is a poor love interest and always feels like an afterthought  no matter how hard the film works to crowbar him into the narrative.  Of the Coyote girls, none really manage to have any meaningful character and are really just there to sex the film up.  Of the three, Banks is treated the worst  her character leaves the bar but then keeps just randomly turning up with explanation.  I'm not complaining because I found her the cutest, but it was further proof of the film's focus on image over everything else.  Goodman doesn't manage to come out with any dignity either and I'm sure the only thing he'll remember about his part in this film will be how much he got paid.Overall  wanna see girls dance and be sexy? Then either go to a club in the real world or sit at home and fast forward to the bar scenes in this film. If you want anything more than that (plot, interesting characters, good story, substance) then you'd best avoid this as it basically has none of those qualities in anything other than very meagre amounts.",Null,4,8,1 November 2003
Gran Torino," Poor performances, weak material and clunky development  Eastwood being a gruff and watchable lead cannot redeem the many problems here
","Having been recently widowed, Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski finds himself all alone in a community that has seen all his former neighbours replaced with members of the Hmong community. Racist, aggressive, distant from his family, Walt is living out his days with beer on his porch, watching the world go by with a gruff sense of disgust. When he finds his neighbour's son trying to steal his car  a prize 1972 Gran Torino  Walt finds his hatred justified but, when he stands up to the gang that had forced Thao into the crime, he is hailed as a local hero by his neighbours and finds himself drawn into the life of Thao and his family.Gran Torino is one of the films that benefited from the Oscar buzz around one certain aspect. Much like Mickey Rourke's performance made people think that The Wrestler was perhaps a better all round film than it was, so talk of an acting Oscar for Eastwood has put this film into the public mind as being 'Oscar-worthy', even if that has been knocked into a cocked hat before it reached the UK. This perception is the only thing I can think of that has motivated so many IMDb users to vote so highly on this title (well, that and the fact that some users will vote 10 or 0 and nothing in between) because this is not a particularly good film by any means. If you read the boards all you will hear about is the standard of acting being a problem but for me the problems start with the script. You see this is a film that really needs convincing and careful character development to make it work. Sadly this is not what we get as the film is written in steps without a lot of attention to getting between these steps in a way that feels real or convincing. The overall arch of the film is engaging in these steps and I did not have an issue with the actual plot but too often it just feels clunky and clumsy in the writing and it gets weaker and weaker as it goes on. Those doubting my concerns over Walt's transformation being rushed and unconvincing can surely not have doubts over the minor characters  the priest talking to Walt towards the end of the film is perhaps one of the worst written changes in character I've seen! As director, Eastwood cannot fix the problems with the script but he is almost good enough to cover it in his own performance. He does this by being what we already know he is  a big gruff presence that can effortlessly fill a cinema screen. This makes him watchable but the material limits him and fortunately the Oscar voters have not been taken in by sentimentality on this occasion. By comparison though he is fantastic because the commendable idea of casting Hmong actors in their debut performances backfires badly with key players failing to deliver. Bee Vang's Thao doesn't have anything like the range required  he is OK when being natural but anything more demanding is flat. Ahney Her's Sue doesn't even really manage that and, while a 'nice' presence she doesn't feel natural and I didn't engage with her or see why Walt would. This problem is not so obvious in the rest of cast they are mostly playing clichés or just hanging around. One person without the excuse of language or inexperience is Carley who is pretty awful but in fairness is given probably the weakest material out of everyone.The whole thing is a really weak film that sums it all up perfectly with a terrible song with terrible singing from Eastwood. This is the final misjudgement of many but the root of it all is the script which takes a basic premise and delivers it in chunky blocks that don't really scan and pushes the viewer away when it should draw them in. Things that should have an impact don't really work because of this and, although Eastwood is a solid presence, he cannot find much to really work with. The performances outside of him are roundly poor and the main players lack the range to deliver when required. The end result is a really poor film and it is embarrassing to see so many users here stepping it claiming it as a piece of greatest  see it for yourself if you wish, but let me assure you it is nothing of the sort, no matter how much I tried to go with it.",Null,20,42,17 February 2009
Hero," A good film but a bit too worthy and lacking in pure entertaining value as it grasp exceeds it's reach, certainly not as good as the hype would have you believe
","For over a decade the King of Qin has lived in fear of assassination from a trio of powerful warriors in the unconquered regions. This time has come to an end with the arrival of Nameless, a middle-ranking official in his kingdom, who brings news that he has defeated them all. As Nameless claims his rewards in the presence of the King he relates his story of how he defeated the assassin Sky and used the love between Broken Sword and Flying Snow to defeat them. However the King questions some of the things that he is being told.It is pretty much impossible at the minute to get a balanced review of this film  there are a handful on this site and I hope that this will be another one (but with this film riding high on the top 250 I imagine I will be slated for not drooling over it!). This film seems to suffer from hype for two reasons. Firstly this is a foreign film and many viewers seem to be forgiving of a subtitled film than they would if the same film was a Hollywood blockbuster (I am guilty of this at times too). Secondly, there seems to be plenty of fan-boy fighting over this movie. For example you're not a real fan unless you've seen the 'blah' version and boasting of how early viewers had seen it  I dread when it is released officially and we'll have fighting over how you need to have seen the region whatever DVD to be a real fan! Sigh! Anyway, I am a fan of martial arts and I eventually decided that I could not wait till late 2004 before I saw a film with Li, Yen and Ziyi all together.I'm sure I will be told that I didn't see the 'right' version of the film, but I can only review what I had and not some wondrous director's cut or whatever. Anyway. Let me say that I thought the film looked great. The cinematography is impressive with use of locations, colours and good (albeit it obvious) use of CGI to add spice to some scenes. The fights themselves are very well done and, again, look impressive but, and here's the crux of my problem, they really aren't what you'd call entertaining. In fact the whole film for me lacked entertainment value because you could feel that it was trying so very hard to be a big impressive grown-up film that is oh-so-worthy. The plot starts well and is interesting but, instead of twisting to become more interesting and involving, it actually twists to become increasingly dull and 'worthy'  again sucking a lot of the life out of the film as it attempts to be important.The film has a message and it labours it. The message seems to be interrupted in several ways and there is a certain amount of anti-war message in there, but this is not the main thrust. No, the main thrust is about the importance of the many over the rights of the individual  it is a rather disturbing message and it left me cold no matter how much false sentiment was put into it by honourable deaths and sentimental music. It delivers it's message to the detriment of the plot and further weakens the ease with which one would get involved in the film. The lack of characters is also a big problem as it is hard to find an entry point  I mistakenly used the mystery behind Nameless' story as my way in only to find myself led down to a dead end. This is not to say that the film is rubbish, for it most certainly is not but it is far from the perfect film many would claim it to be. The main problem comes from it's aim to be 'worthy'. The action scenes are not really enjoyable because they are all very solemn; the plot's mystery element is lost in the rush to deliver a worthy message type denouncement typical of a film stretching to obtain some sort of artistic value and the actual substance of the film is really rather dull and uninvolving and, trust me, as someone who has been excited about this film for a while, this is hard for me to say.In terms of performances I will say that all the cast are very talented and natural when it comes to the martial arts side of the film. They make the wire work look a lot more artistic and acceptable than many Hollywood stars do (who often look like they are being pulled in very unnatural ways), however I'm not a massive fan of fight scenes built 100% around flying, floating and levitating. I have already said that the fight scenes lack excitement and an awe factor but they are still impressive and worth seeing  it's just a shame that I saw unmoved by such talent. In terms of actual acting the film suffers from the cast being mostly stifled by values of honour and sacrifice  ie they are not real people and suffer from lack of character. Li is not a great actor but he does what his character requires and does it well; he is really more about his other skills. Yen was a letdown with very little to do outside of his one early scene  I like him a lot and wanted more of a performance, although it was some consolation that his movement was impressive. Cheung is a fine actress but she is rather stale here I thought. I could see she was trying to bring a lot out with small gestures but the film asks her to be impassive and that's pretty much what she does. Ziyi has no character but at least she has plenty of raw emotion  something the film desperately needed. Chen is good simply because he is not bound by the 'worthiness' that affects the rest of the cast. Standout for me was Tony Leung, an actor I always have time for. He is able to bring a lot out of his character and he managed to involve me where the others didn't really.Visually the film is a feast  the landscapes, the effects, the fights, the colours, the movement, the costumes, the sets, the extras  they all look great and contribute to an impressive feeling film. It is just a shame that it kept stretching for something else that it never reached. It wants so desperately to be worthy and respected that you can hear it say 'look at me, look at me  I'm so much more than a martial arts film' in almost every scene! I don't wish to sound harsh but it is this aspiration to worthiness that really damages how involving and enjoyable it is (and I don't mean I just wanted fighting and nothing else  I can enjoy the most sombre of films, if it gets everything right).Overall I found this to be surprisingly plodding and to have tried too hard to reach a status that it never gets to. It looks fantastic and some may be taken in by this feast for the eyes combined with 'worthy' aspects and an emotional score, but I needed more substance and a more assured delivery. It is a good film no doubt, but it's flaws are obvious and I feel sorry for QT's minions hoping for this to be Kill Bill 3 only to find it to be rather dull (although I imagine they'll hype it regardless!). See it for what it is  a beautiful film with great choreography and cinematography but sadly not the plot, audience-involvement, characters or performances to really do the visuals justice. Good but no more than that.",Null,2,6,31 May 2004
Shrek the Third," Enjoyable even if it is rather overblown and lacks a real core of wit and story
","Shrek and Fiona are finding it hard going standing in for the King and Queen of Far Far Away Land but at least the end is in sight. However when King Harry dies and leaves the throne to Shrek (the only other heir is a high-school student), the problem of public appearances and endless ceremony appears not to be going away. So, despite the worrying news of Fiona's pregnancy, Shrek sets sail with his friends to bring Arthur, the only other heir, back to claim his throne (rightful or not) so Shrek can get back to his swamp. However, while he is away, Prince Charming lead a cast of villains on a coup d'etat on the leaderless land.The third Shrek film was rather beaten by critics when it was released, to the point that I decided not to bother with it in the cinemas (although the impact of a kiddie audience also helped put me off). This evening I decided to watch the films that LoveFilm had sent me and, as if to show that I do tend to watch a diverse mix of things I found that my viewing for tonight was the brutal IrrÃ©versible followed by this film (well, after a short recovery break). The contrast is different I'm sure you'll agree but I was looking forward to Shrek after that experience. So perhaps I forgave it some things that I wouldn't have otherwise as a form of release from the bleakness. In this way I found some of the film to be quite fun but even in this state I still have to say that the film is weaker than the second, which was in turn weaker than the first.The problem is again with the plot. In the first film the story was the core of everything and all the references and jokes branched off this. Here the opposite is true as the story seems to happy with lots of material put around it. The difference can be best seen in the fact that the plot mostly provides a frame for the film but the laughs and fun generally come in the asides and the support characters rather than the main flow or the main characters. This is not a massive failure, because the laughs are there, but it is at very least a weakness and after a while it became noticeable that I was not really that interested in Shrek or Arthur but just looking forward to the next scene with the Gingerbread Man. Ironically the plot is rather complex and will probably be over the head of the child viewers and it did make me long for a simpler but stronger story.The cast continue to do pretty well regardless. Myers and Diaz are both OK mainly because the film doesn't hand them great material to work with. Murphy and Banderas are both fun for the opposite reason while the supporting cast of Big Bad Wolf, Gingerbread, pigs etc all continue to be fun. Timberlake, Andrews, Everett, McShane and so on are OK but not great with only Python's Idle and Cleese standing out among the star names.Overall then an enjoyable film with just about enough laughs to carry it but still the weakest in the Shrek series. The plot is overly complex and the majority of fun belongs to the minor characters while the title roles are too tied up in the busy narrative to have time to consistently deliver the laughs. Shrek Goes Forth (or something like that) seems inevitable so hopefully the makers can take what continues to work from here and put right what has been falling down in the last two films.",Null,1,4,16 March 2008
The Hurt Locker," Has weaknesses in the story/characters but is mostly tense, urgent and engaging in its depiction of the job
","The Hurt Locker caught my eye while I was in America earlier this year as the worst review I saw gave it 4 stars and many seemed happy to give it the full 5. I never got round to seeing it then but when it came to the UK (to similar reception) I made a point of getting to see it in the cinema. Seeing it leaves with the conclusion that going off star ratings is no way to go about summarising a film because in some ways this is a quite remarkable and gripping film but then, in other aspects, it is surprisingly underdeveloped and wanting. The good news is though that the strengths it has outweigh the weaknesses and, while they remain in your head as an issue, they are not what you take away from the film.What you do go away with is a memory of very tense and engaging film that puts the viewer right into the action. Or rather, lack of action because the film is at its best when nothing happens because it manages to capture the sense of threat and urgency associated with having civilians who may be insurgents watching while the defusing is going on and time is of the essence. Quite how realistic it is when it comes to the specifics I guess is questionable (the forums are full of people discussing the minutiae of this scene and that scene) but in terms of translating the feelings to the viewer it is certainly very good. There is a tension to all these scenes combined with an excitement to be working against someone for the 'win' – that someone being the bomb manufacturer and the 'contest' being to see which person can achieve their goal for the bomb – defuse or go off. On top of this we also get the suddenness and pointlessness of death in this situation, where the enemy can come from nowhere and is hard to identify, leading to this constant edge that sets the film off nicely.Contrary to some opinion, the film doesn't really have much to say about Iraq and indeed the same film could be set in any modern conflict zone because of the relative unimportance of specifics. This is a good thing because it puts the focus on the men doing the job and, as suggested by the title card quote, what drives them to do it. Unfortunately it is in this area where the film doesn't quite work as well as it does when dishing out scenes of the job and the dangers inherent in it. The characters are characters and don't manage to become people for any length of time so, despite the more worthy goal of the film, we never really get into their heads beyond the obvious. Similarly the film doesn't have a great 'story'. This doesn't matter for the vast majority of the film because the tension of the job is everything, but later in the day we have several sections that don't work particularly well because they seem to be heading off from 'the job' as if in search of a character-development point or a direction to provide narrative flow beyond the episodic.I refer to the stuff involving Beckham and also the 'beyond the blast perimeter' stuff towards the end. Both of these are OK but both seem to occur without a lot of justification and don't seem to add a lot to the story or character. Bigelow direction matches the weaknesses in the material because she is at her best when dealing with the action on the ground. The cast manage more consistency in their characters to the point where I wanted them to have more opportunity to develop their characters because it was clear they could. I've seen Mackie many times before but this is the first time I remember being impressed by him as he is very good and has the 'most real' scene in the film. Renner plays the driven-part bang on but maybe doesn't have much to do to show his addiction, regrets etc – the scenes that do are generally pretty obvious. He is also strong though while Geraghty is a good third player albeit the film doesn't give him more than a few minutes to convey the feelings that are big part of his character. The supporting cast are solid as well as all of them play into the intensity of the film rather than the complexity (or lack of).Hurt Locker is not the brilliant film that many claim it is – it has too many gaps/weaknesses in the narrative and material to really stand out as that, but these are covered by the qualities that you will remember the film for. It is the ground where the film is strongest, where the threat (or perceived threat) is everywhere, where death is sudden and without any 'death scene' fanfare or trimmings and most of the movie is spent hoping there won't be action rather than just waiting for the next being CGI action sequence. The tension and excitement of these scenes are what the film is about and they do make the film worth seeing to the point where they carry it across the weaker aspects that come in the second half.",Null,14,23,6 September 2009
K-19: The Widowmaker," Interesting  if that's a good thing to say
","The Soviet Union's first nuclear ballistic submarine, the K-19 is being prepared for testing.  The aim of the test will be a show of strength to American spy planes in order to ensure that America dare not strike first for fear of retaliation.  For the test the submarine is captained by Vostrikov with second in command Polenin. During the mission the submarine experiences a malfunction in it's reactor which could potentially explode. The risk is not only to the crew but a nuclear blast may set off world conflict.  The crew race to avert disaster.I happily went to see this at an UK preview screening in Birmingham.  It wasn't due out for another month but I read nothing into this.  I didn't know the story or anything about the film so I was a clean sheet.  As such the film interested me as it is a story I didn't know and even if only half of the film is actually true then it is still a fascinating story.  However the film fails to deliver on the intensity of the story.  Instead we get a plodding film that is so concerned with being factual and serious that it forgets to be entertaining or involving.Director Bigelow takes a story that involves sacrifice, death, tension, potential global destruction and turns it into an overlong, dull film for the most part.  Only in the final half hour do we get a feel for the excitement and tension in the submarine.  Prior to this we have an dull (yet interesting) look at drills, life on board a sub and more drills.  It's not that the story is dull but it's told at a snails pace and really misses every opportunity to turn the screws. I noticed one of the production companies was National Geographic and I can see their impact.  This isn't a Crimson Tide style film, but instead a documentary that is so worthy and serious that it forgets it has to at least engage or entertain it's audience.Ford and Neeson together are good.  In fact some of the best scenes revolve around their relationship during the disaster.  Individually they are both strong with Ford's accent only wandering slightly the odd time  Neeson also slips into Russian/Irish the odd time.  The rest of the cast are OK but they don't stick in the mind.  The way we are treated to a little background information on each and a group photograph just makes it feel like the lazy character building done in disaster movies to try and make you care for the ones who may or may not die later.Overall this does have it's moments and it is a story worth being told, however if you're going to make a Hollywood film then at least make it a good one!  This drags it's heels all the way to a good last 30 minutes. There are some sparks but really it feels very pedestrian.  It is interesting  but is that enough?  What should have been a gripping real life thriller with the world as the stakes is turned into a slightly dull, overlong film that just feels so damn heavy and serious that though I like it I still couldn't say I enjoyed it.",Null,2,4,26 September 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Visually stunning and inventive, cool soundtrack and great love story  but John Leguizamo's cartoon antics must go...
","English writer Christain finds himself introduced to the heady pleasures of the Moulin Rouge burlesque and to the fabulous beauty of the tragic Satine. Christian finds himself in a case of mistaken identify when Satine seduces him instead of the Duke (the potential backer for Satine's chance to star in a play).  Before the mistake is realised Christian is in love and must struggle with envy while Satine plays along with the Duke in return for his money.  But will love win out?Maybe I suffered from the hype but I was a tad disappointed in this film. At the heart it has a beautiful love story between Satine and Christian which has added spice due to her commitment to the Duke and her potential death from consumption.  This side of the story plays well but the rest of it is almost like a cartoon.  The cartoon/comedy side is fun too but it takes away from the love story.The director is great  he did it with Romeo & Juliet and he does it here. He has such an imagination and the film is a real joy to watch  so clever, so inventive.  But he has also allowed characters in that create a cartoon feel  Toulouse-Lautrec and his fellow actors are prime examples.  I found that this took away from my enjoyment slightly as it pushed some scenes from being imaginative and different into being silly.That said I still enjoyed the film.  The central story is fantastic and visually it is amazing.  The music is superb as well  going from one style to the next, with absurd scenes to beautiful scenes (`Your Song' is my favourite scene, I could watch it 100 times!).  Occasionally it doesn't work but it is audacious in the attempt.The cast are mostly great.  Kidman and McGregor are both on top form and aquit themselves well  both in the singing and the acting stakes.  Jim Broadbent is good value as Harold, the club owner and Roxburgh gives a wonderfully smarmy performance as the Duke.  John Leguizamo was good in Romeo & Juliet, and Lurman should have left it there  nobody can get two good performances out of this guy.  His cartoon antics don't seem out of place in the first half of the film  but when the mood changes he is left mugging and being irritating.  He has some good moments  but I really think that the guy needs to only do serious roles until he loses that irritating habit of mugging.Overall I thought this was a brave, inventive film that has a wonderful story at it's heart.  However it is maybe hyped too much and I found that the cartoon antics of some of the characters were irritating rather than involving.  But I still really enjoyed it!",Null,2,14,30 March 2002
Meet Joe Black," Could have been charming and light  instead it's mostly tiresome, overlong and occasionally terrible
","Media magnate William Parrish is approaching his 65th birthday.  While dealing with his business problems he advises his youngest daughter Susan that she must find true love.  She meets a young man in a coffee shop and falls for his charms but leaves without him.  When the young man is hit by a bus and killed, Death decides to use his body to visit earth.  He postpones the death of Parrish in return for experiencing life.  However his influence causes an impact on Parrish's business and on his daughter.This is a rework of 1934's `Death Takes a Holiday' - four writers worked tirelessly to take that short charmer and spin it into a ponderous three hour slog.  The story is simple enough - Death comes to earth, falls in love, makes friends, is a fish out of water but must eventually go back' - however it's seriously stretched and delivered in very slow chunks.  The various strands (the business confrontation, the romance etc) don't sit well together and it's like the writers all took turns rather than working together.  At the start it is quite charming, but the longer it goes on, the less you care and the less charming it becomes.Why did it have to be so long?  There are so many elements of the story that could have been trimmed down.  So many scenes could have been told in a shorter time or removed totally.  It feels like nothing they shot ended up on the cutting room floor.  For example, Pitt shares several scenes (total about 10 minutes) with an elderly Jamaican woman, these scenes don't add anything to the film: more than that they are terrible - Pitt does a horrible, horrible patwa accent.  Surely the editor should have removed these on quality alone!If this had been good then it wouldn't matter if it was so long - but there's only enough to last for 2 hours at most.  That's 60 minutes worth of filler that could have been lost.  The performances are mixed, but are mainly as heavy and unwieldy as the film itself.  Pitt starts well - his human' role is really charming and I thought that he was already Death and thought he'd be that way for the whole film.  However when he becomes death he is totally flat and lifeless - obviously that's how Death would be, but it makes him really dull and wastes the charm that has made him a star.  His Jamaican accent is absolutely terrible and just shows he has no judgement. Forlani holds her own well beside an experienced cast but the romance between her and death is unbelievable due to Pitt's stony performance. Hopkins is good throughout and shows Pitt up to be a star rather than an actor.  The support is mostly good - but that old Jamaican lady has got to go!The film is far too long - at one point I thought it was winding up and that the end must be 10 minutes away - it was winding up (and did what I thought it would) but instead of 10 minutes it took 45!  Such luxurious running times should only be permitted to films that can sustain them.Overall this could have been a charming little film.  Instead it buries that charm in a three hour running time that it can't sustain.  I liked it but I wished it would end after the first 120 minutes.  Somewhere out there - it is still going!",Null,9,16,4 February 2002
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Some good aspects but mostly poorly delivered in a rushed and messy film (SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS)
","I'm not sure why I ended up watching this film since I didn't think they did anything good with the first rebooted film – but I think it did help that I was coming into the film with low expectations. It is disappointing then that even low expectations seemed hardly able to be met. It did not have to be this way; the film has interesting aspects, good aspects and clearly more than enough money than it needs to do what it wants to do. The problem is that it seems to have so much it does what to do that in the end it does none of them well.I don't know what it is with these films that they need to have so many villains and so much going on, but it is a negative in this case. The plot is bloated and has this stuttering feeling where no matter what it is doing in that moment, it feels like it wants to be doing something different (which it usually does within a minute or two). This ruins a lot of what might have been good. The relationship side is actually nicely done but is not given the time to really be what it needs to be; it is superficial despite the efforts of the lead two actors, and what might have been seen as a brave narrative twist in the later stages is actually horribly misjudged and wasted as it rushes from the key scene into the next bit. This applies to the smaller characters as well – we have no interest in them apart from being able to use them – so the rush is on just to get them to the stage where they are special effects. Electro/Max is one of the best example of this since he is really a tragic figure full of humanity but yet hurt and anger – the film shows us this but then does nothing with it whatsoever. Same with Osborn, the background of Parker's family, and many other details – although of course the total waste of a brave twist involving Gwen is probably the hardest to see.Visually the film has a lot going on but yet it matters so little. Some of the effects are really too computer-generated for their own good, while too many big scenes are just too big and noisy – rather than drawing the viewer into them, they are aggressive in pushing the viewer away instead. As a result I found it almost tiring that there was so many big scenes but yet I cared so little; the overused slow-motion stuff detracted more than it added and generally I found little of merit beyond excessive spectacle. The cast are mostly lost in the middle of this and the good work many of them do is just wasted. Garfield and Stone are good, but the film doesn't let them build this and when it really gives Garfield something to do, it moves on immediately like it was nothing. Foxx and DeHaan are both capable of so much more and indeed the tragic base of their characters is interesting, but soon enough they are just people jumping around on a greenscreen set.A third film is on the way and I'm sure on a plane or a wet afternoon or some other dead time, I'll put it on because it demands no effort from my side to watch it. I wish it was not this way but the second of the rebooted Spider-Man films holds out aspects which are good and could have been so much better – but instead loses them with no focus, too much of a rush, and too much stuff trying to be crammed in so it has really no room to breathe.",Null,3,7,1 November 2014
Ex Machina," Unsurprising in some ways, but still professionally and engagingly presented (SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS)
","A solid piece of sci-fi this, which benefits from jumping right into it from the get-go. The film opens with Caleb winning an employee lottery to go and work with the head of the company on his estate, and within minutes we are there, and down to a very focused film with only a few players. It works better for this, and the sci-fi benefits from being about ideas and people talking. The special effects are astonishing, but are more impressive for how they support the narrative rather than being the equivalent of a fireworks display (although that explains why this is one of the lowest grossing films to win the special effects Oscar).The ultimate destination is perhaps unsurprising, however the film unfolds well, allowing for the inevitable to occur but also dragging in other ideas too. It spells it all out a bit too much at the end, but it still works, so maybe it was necessary to do that. There is a palatable sense of tension across the film, as the character reveal more of themselves, and take their paths. Although we know where it is leading, the film keeps one engaged in the moment, so there is less time spent trying to guess the outcome. The effects are the headline perhaps, but the performances make it work. Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander are all strong in different ways, but it is their ensemble work that makes the film work.In the end the story has a familiar conclusion, and nothing it can do freshens that up; however it is still engaging and interesting stuff, thanks in no small part to some strong performances and very impressive effects.",Null,4,8,20 December 2016
Back to the Future Part III," Easy to follow and easy to enjoy but yet far from being simplistic or patronising Â– a great family blockbuster
","Stuck back in 1955, Marty receives a letter from Doc Brown that was written in 1885. Marty takes the letter to Doc in 1955 and together they discover where Doc in 1885 hid the DeLorean. However while uncovering the machine, Marty spots a gravestone that shows Doc was shot in the back and killed by Mad Dog Tannen a mere week after writing the letter. Using the DeLorean, Marty goes back to 1885 to save Doc by brining him back to 1985 where it all began; however on arrival he almost immediately gets into trouble with Mad Dog himself.Having done the future in the previous film, this final instalment in the trilogy goes back to the old west to produce and enjoyable story while also poking fun at the traditions of the western. Similar to the first two films it is a solid family film with an easy to follow time travel plot. It also continues similar themes around the main one of the characters trying to get 'back to the future' while we have other subplots regarding Biff, romance and so on. It isn't that deep or that complex but it delivers a solid story with a good heart that is never overshadowed by specific scenes of action and it is affectionate and fun. As director Zemeckis does a great job of pacing the film and providing fun that straddles both genres to good effect and the whole thing does look very professional.The cast continue to be be as good as they were in the other two films and mostly buy into the tone of the film and support it. Fox shows why he was a big draw when he was younger and is the real heart of the film. He just about holds his own alongside scene-stealing Lloyd (although his 'great scott' stuff did get a bit old after a while). Wilson does his usual routine but still makes it feel pretty funny, while Tolkan does the same in a smaller role. Steenburger is a nice addition and works well with Lloyd in their join scenes. Thompson is reasonably OK for all she has to do.Overall then a fun and affectionate film that acts as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. Easy to follow and easy to enjoy but yet far from being simplistic or patronising, it is a great family blockbuster that crosses genres and does so with a good heart.",Null,3,6,4 January 2007
La Grande Illusion," Offers sombre introspection but didn't win me over or draw me in particularly well
","This film was recently released on DVD and this was the trigger for me to finally get around to seeing the film I frequently heard referred to as a classic. I came to it not knowing what to expect from it – although of course I had some awareness of what others had said of it. Early on I was surprised by the fact that it jumps to the POW prison very quickly and that it doesn't have much in the way of action; I was also quite surprised by how much light humor there was in it – although this was perhaps more to do with the characters rather than the film itself. Indeed so surprised was I that I began to quite enjoy the film and be taken by the characters, the world of the escape attempts and the odd, chivalrous tension between the opposing officers.This turned out to be an error because soon the film starts to bring out the real anti-war message and the focus becomes on the pointlessness and emptiness of war, with the supposed rules and standards of behavior being little more than a paper thin construct of no real meaning. While many viewers find this engaging, I'm afraid that I did not – and trust me when I say that I wish I could, since it is always good to agree with the majority when it comes to 'classic' cinema, for fear of being labelled an idiot due to a differing opinion. While I was quite held by the mix of realism, humanity, drama and pointlessness, there are several point where the focus on the latter becomes too tight. I should have seen it coming when we only hear about the many escape attempts (rather than see them) but it is not long before the emptiness of it all is pushed forward without anything else to provide framing for it to exist within.Don't get wrong, there is still much to enjoy with what the film does, but it did seem rather obvious the more it went on. I loved the contradictions within the attitudes of the German soldiers at the end, but mainly because this was smartly done and not pushed in my face as much as some of the other aspects of the second half. The actors give into it as well, even if they are mostly still good. Gabin is a good lead while I thought Stroheim and Fresnay worked well off each other throughout. The direction is good although the tone and pacing seems a little off scene-to-scene and also as a whole.This is still an interesting film as it provides a sombre view of war with a sense of the hollowness and meaninglessness of the artificial rules and structures established by man, but it is not quite the amazing film that most viewers will come to it expecting. Perhaps a historical appreciation of the film's place in cinema is what I'm missing, but for me it just seemed to be rather obvious in what it did and it did this will rapidly dropping any allusions towards being entertaining that the first half of the film suggested. It is an engaging film even with this, but it is best approached by blocking out the claims of classic and high praise that everyone seems to have for it – then expectations will be more measured.",Null,3,4,23 June 2012
The Illusionist," Surprising dull affair as it misfires on various levels
","As a child, Edward fell in love with a girl who was outside his social class. The girl is taken from him and he is warned of arrest for himself and his wider family. Years pass with Edward travelling the world  the details of this varying depending on which story you listen to. Either way, he eventually remerges under the moniker Eisenheim the Illusionist and is a big draw as his blend of magic and the supernatural leaves audiences gasping. When he comes to Vienna, he finds the girl he loved has become a woman and is now engaged to Crown Prince Leopold.I was curious to see this having seen The Prestige simply because thematically they seemed similar. However, beyond the idea of using the magic, the period and the uncertainity between real and illusion, the story is quite different as it is much more of a romance-driven tale. Someone on the message board for this film joked that you can tell which of the two films you will prefer if you simply refer to your genitalia and in a way they are quite correct because I do see The Illusionist being of more appeal to women. Maybe I should pull that comment back a bit though, because, regardless of what sex you are, I suspect that you might find this to be as dull as I did.In theory what we should have here is a smart mystery that is driven forward by a romantic history that we care about. This should lead to a 'reveal' that brings everything together in the sort of way that those who have enjoyed The Usual Suspects will appreciate. However stage by stage it all fell down for me. Firstly we are handed a childish 'love' that we are asked to care about  understandably I didn't at this point but I looked to it to be made real for me in the adult stage of the characters. Of course it seems that the writers told nobody about this because the relationship is never convincing and as such this emotional hook into the film doesn't catch  it probably didn't help that Norton and Biel go as well together as ice cream and syphilis.So this left me with the mystery inherent in the plot. Sadly this failed to interest me either. The magic aspect of it took it beyond my interest simply because, by being set in the world where 'anything is possible or can be made to appear possible' I knew that the film could really do whatever it wanted to do. This was further reason why the narrative failed to draw me in and, not only that, but I actually found it quite dull as I found myself caring less how the couple made their getaway (I assumed) or what would happen. The final few minutes of the film is evidence of the failure to engage as we are given what was clearly intended to be an ending with the impact of The Usual Suspects  where the entire film is shifted in a 'reveal' that only served to make a good film even better. However here nothing is really revealed and it left me wondering what the 'solution' that so amuses Uhl actually was. Of course maybe I would have been more taken by the ending if I'd actually been made to care about the narrative (as I had with Suspects) but, as mentioned  I didn't.It is not that it is a bad film, just more that it was like a dud that never actually fired for me. Having said that though the one area where it did engage me was the cinematography. For a film dealing with what is real and what is not, I thought the decision to use bold colours was a good one as it made everything seem almost overly real and tangible in a way where real 'reality' is much more grittier and less impressive than that which is presented as such. Visually the rather stiff cast fit in with this visual creation but otherwise they do mostly come off dull and stiff. Together they are poor but individually neither Norton or Biel offer much. The latter was no surprise to me but seeing Norton failing to emote was a surprise since I do rate him as an actor. He is overly stiff and as a character he offered me nothing to engage with. I almost want to assume that this was a conscious decision because the rest of the cast match this. Giamatti is flat but next to the flop that is Sewell he does appear to be giving the performance of his life.A dull film then that really failed to engage or interest me. As a romance it fails as the chemistry is totally absent from the lead two while, as a mystery, the magic element actually works against it, meaning the Usual Suspect ending did nothing for me and certainly did not have anything like the impact that it was suppose to do.",Null,13,21,18 July 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Basic material creates plenty of dull sections that the technically impressive but rather uninteresting action cannot compensate for (mild suggestive spoilers)
","Since they got their powers, the Fantastic Four have also got something else: media savvy. Johnny is running out of room for sponsors logos and the oft-delayed wedding of Sue Storm and Reed Richards is the talk of the country. For these reasons the group seem a little distracted whenever a galactic anomaly seems to be affecting the earth. Undeterred, Reed continues with his plans to get married, although does take the time to build a device to track the anomaly. The device works of course but it does have the unwanted side-effect of bringing the 'anomaly' to the party in the form of an alien with great power on a surf-board style craft who it seems cannot be stopped in his mission to deliver worlds for destruction by his master.For some reason I decided to go and see this at a midnight screening (12:01) on the day it came out. I think that it was perhaps because I hadn't read any negative reviews (or any reviews really) that I hoped it would be good and live up to the trailer. Sadly it didn't. We start off with a soapy plot involving the marriage of Richards and Storm, which is dull. This continues as Johnny learns that he is a bit too self-centred and there are other such plot threads kicking around. Unfortunately most of this stuff feels written by committee as it is pretty simplistic fare. This has the knock-on effect of making most of the dialogue and narrative-driven scenes feel slow and, occasionally, painful to get through  which is a problem because there are plenty of them.The only slight exception is the story of the surfer himself, which does have a bit of pathos lurking in the background  if only the writers didn't seem to be working so far to show it with the least amount of effort required. This leaves the action sequences, which, let's be honest, is what we're all here for. Firstly, they mostly LOOK great  with only some of the stretching effects looking a bit weak. However there is a lot of time between the sequences and the writers seemed to be unable to really produce more than one or maybe two solid sequences  which again leaves us with the weak writing to fill the gaps in between. Personally I also found the action to be quite uninvolving; I never felt tension or excitement and wasn't drawn into the story by the action  which really I should have been. The initial fight with the surfer is good but you've seen all that in the trailer already. This leaves a bit more of the same in different locations (but with diminished impact) and the challenge of how to make a climatic battle against a massive space cloud seem exciting and be a great close to the action (and here's a clue  they can't. The ending is a big damp squib).With the weak material it is no surprise that the cast struggle. Gruffudd is actually OK as he has loosened up and seems more confident in the 'lead' than he was before. Evans is quite fun but he is unconvincing when the switch is flicked and he is asked to 'look sad and say d'oh' to convey depth that isn't there for him on the page. Chiklis is amusing but this is all the film uses him for and it isn't really fair on him that he has become no more than a comedy character. McMahon is OK but the script hands him such a weak pantomime villain that it is hard to take him seriously  he has no time to build and his plan is obvious from his first appearance on screen. Jones does good work yet again behind heavy makeup/CGI and he had a good physical presence. Fishburne's voice is a pretty good fit but he has little to say and thus no time to bring out character in his voice. Braugher was solid and Washington plays blind well enough. Which just leaves Alba  blonde again and bland again. USA Today did a piece on her last week, praising her female superhero for not being a male fetish character but being clothed in suits like the men and not in skimpy things. Obviously the usual 'becomes visible without any clothes on' moment suggests that the paper should have watched the film before commenting, but the bigger problem is that Alba is not a good actress, she is a very pretty model who can say lines well enough to convince in basic scenarios. And this is what she does  says lines without sounding like she is reading them  but not a whole lot more than that. So by hiding her body she makes herself a rather pointless presence; I mean, what do you remember about her from things like Sin City and Into The Blue? Her performance or how great her body was? I'm guessing very few people will say the former.Overall then, a pretty simplistic summer blockbuster that has no real depth or good material to adequately fill the gaps between the action and nowhere near enough really good action to make up for the gaps between one sequence and the next. I didn't expect Citizen Kane  but I certainly wanted more fun and excitement from it than I got.",Null,10,20,15 June 2007
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," The sci-fi story and environmental message blends together really well and produces an engaging film that is visually impressive and imaginative
","In the future the Earth has been decimated by the 'Seven Days of Fire' and the human population is clinging to survival in small pockets. Their main ongoing threat is the spread of the toxic jungle where the spores are poisonous to mankind and an uneasy tolerance exists with the creatures in the jungle  where they feel under threat the creatures attack with force and numbers greater that can be withstood. In one area called the Valley of the Wind, Princess Nausicaa strives to understand the jungle rather than fight it. However when her village discovers a surviving Giant Warrior, they are taken over by Princess Kushana and her men sparking a fight for not only the valley but the earth itself.I couldn't really care less whether this is 'officially' a Studio Ghibli film or not (I'll leave that to the 'hard core' fans to worry about), the main thing that interested me was whether I would enjoy this film in the way I have some other Miyazaki or if it would be one of the ones that I felt fell short of the mark, for whatever reason. Despite only being a few years after the disappointing Castle of Cagliostro, this seems a world away from that average film and is a well rounded story full of great animation that will appeal to adults and children. The sci-fi plot is engaging and has a solid environmental message at its core regarding the balance of nature and the lack of understanding we (man) seems to have of it all. At times it is a bit heavy and obvious a message but it is never to the point of being a turnoff or patronising. It helps that the message is woven in with the narrative so it is not as clunky as it could have been.The animation is great and again was a nice surprise considering how soon after the basic Castle of Cagliostro it came. The sci-fi setting makes for good use of Miyazaki's vision and imagination and it is a quite beautiful film to watch if you like the sci-fi genre. Whether it is in the aircrafts, the creatures or the whole environment, visually it is impressive and engaging throughout. I know there is always the debate over versions and dubs with these things but I can only watch what is available and I as happy that the 2005 dub of this was not the universally hated dub done earlier. However this is not to say that I loved Lohan in the lead role. She was OK for the most part but when the material asked more of her I occasionally found her wanting and a bit grating. Generally she was fine but it is hard to think she has the depth or range that the dub could have used at times. Stewart can deliver the phone book like it was profound writing and he is great value here, the only shame being his character has comparatively little screen time once it gets going. Support is generally good past these two from solid turns from Uma Thurman among others.Overall this is an impressive film that doesn't feel even one of its 22 years of age. The sci-fi story and environmental message blends together really well and produces an engaging film that is visually impressive and imaginative. I don't have kids but if I did then this would be on my video shelf in place of some of the recent Hollywood animation offerings churned out.",Null,3,4,3 September 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Technically impressive but the weaknesses in the material makes it a 'good' film  not the great one that everyone is suggesting
","Daisy has been on her deathbed for quite some time and her daughter Julia is determined to be there as she leaves this world. As they sit together, Daisy asks Julia to read from her from the diary, postcards and letters of Benjamin Button, a man she had known her whole life. His life begins by being abandoned by his father on the doorstep of an old people's home where he is taken in and pitied for appearing to be older than many of those at the end of their life. So it continues as the child Benjamin starts his life as an old man but appears to be younger physically as he ages. His story tells of love and loss, war and peace, life and death.Benjamin Button comes to the UK on a wave of Oscar hype and nominations and many critics here have given it an unquestioning five out of five stars and lavished praise on it. Of course I was keen to see it and went to see a preview as soon as I could  not expecting brilliance but just out of interest to see the film that is wowing them. The truth about the film is as to be expected these days about many 'big' films, which is that it doesn't really deliver on all the things you hear about it. Fortunately this is not a dull summer blockbuster that had all the money shots in the trailer and Benjamin Button is an engaging and enjoyable film  it is just not the 'soul-filling' 'visionary piece' or 'modern classic' that some have hailed it as. In the broad story of a man's life, the film is engaging and has plenty going on  as others have said the film doesn't feel as long as it is and in essence I was interested in what was happening and what was going to happen.The problem is that I was rarely that interested in what had happened and I didn't really feel myself being that engaged by the lives I was watching. In a way this is a positive thing because the film doesn't ever go for the easy emotions and it stays away from the sweeping musical scores and grand emotion that some directors would have milked as hard and as often as possible. This restraint is to Fincher's credit as it creates a more adult and worthy feel as opposed to the feel of someone frantically pushing 'cry' or 'laugh' buttons but it does leave me with the problem that I ended the film feeling like I had watched a 'nice' film  not a great one. Within the context of the narrative, the ageing backwards concept didn't produce what I would have liked. Here and there it gave me pause for thought due to putting a slightly different spin on a common situation but I'm not sure how much I was doing versus the film. Outside of the odd moment, the film follows birth to death and the direction of ageing isn't really that important in terms of the story being told, it makes it feel unusual sure, but doesn't actually deliver much with it. I was looking for a new perspective on things, something to justify the concept but it never really came. What this left me with was an OK film and I am left looking on at those weeping and proclaiming it to be one of the finest films ever and wondering, really, what am I missing? Technically I have no qualms with the film because the special effects are so good that you barely notice them. The 'old man' effects are one thing but it is really impressive to see Pitt looking younger than I've ever seen him but still unmistakably be Brad Pitt. This is true of the whole film as it just feels pretty real, whether it be the 'show piece' effects or just the way everything convinces as being of the period. Indeed in this area the film excels and I think it deserves the many technical etc Oscars I'm sure it will pick up. The performances are good but perhaps not quite as heartfelt as I would have liked. I do not mean I needed them to be obvious or weeping at the drop of a hat but they didn't have as much inside consistently as I wanted. Pitt is solid and has easy charisma but I didn't feel for him, I didn't think he put anything into his character's heart as a result of ageing backwards. Likewise Blanchett was only strong in a few specific scenes and didn't have much to work with beyond that. The support cast are good though as we have turns from Ormound, Flemyng, Henson, Swinton, Koteas and others all doing solid work.So perhaps it is just me. I suspect I will have the votes and the PM's to assure me how wrong I am but I cannot see this film as being more that 'pretty good'. No matter how impressive the technology is or how interesting the concept is, it just doesn't have enough about it in the material to really be engaging, insightful or particularly moving. It is in no way 'bad'  I liked it and time moved quickly despite the length but it is just now the classic that many are calling it. A good film that could and should have been much better  don't expect more than that.",Null,19,36,7 February 2009
Transformers," Noisy and expensive but offers little else
","The US secretary of defence calls together all experts at his disposal to try and decode a signal that will reveal who just wiped out a military base in Qatar in an attempt to hack into the central computer network. Had they known that a small group of survivors had made it out led by Captain Lennox, they would have known that the attack was a helicopter that changed into a robot and used devastating weapons to destroy everything. Meanwhile, back in the US, nobody officially knows anything so the fact that high school student Sam Witwicky believes his second hand car has a mind of its own, gets him nothing but trouble. But could he be a bigger piece in the puzzle than anyone knows?In the middle of a disappointing summer for blockbusters, I must admit that Transformers went from being one I was planning to see, to become yet another film that I had no desire to rush to be disappointed by. However my girlfriend took me along and I suppose it helped that really nothing about the film suggested that I should expect anything from it. With this in mind I found it mildly entertaining in a simple-minded and noisy way, but this is very different from saying it is a 'good' film.I sort of fall in a strange place in regards viewing the film because technically I should be a massive fan and very touchy over the details. I loved the toys as a child and got the weekly comic until it finished in the UK at issue 300-something but then on the other hand I really have few affectionate memories of them (and all the possessions are gone!). To a point I did think 'well, that's wrong' here and there but really I didn't care that much. What bothered me more were the countless weaknesses in areas I would associate with storytelling and film-making rather than the details of a fictional race of robots. First I suppose I should give credit to the effects, because this is what the film is all about. They are excellent and they were so convincingly real that I never found myself looking for the joins. The scale of them does mean it all gets a bit frantic at times and too often I lost track of what was happening.Too often though, the action didn't engage because I just didn't really care about the characters  human or not. This problem is nothing that any extra money spent on effects can solve because it comes from the writing, the acting and the total delivery of the film; I am finding it more and more  too many films are doing whatever effects allow them, rather than letting the film dictate the effects to be used. Anyway, the script is full of clunky dialogue and has all the narrative logic of a drunken argument after closing time. It is best not to ask too much about the importance of Witwicky etc because it has all the strength of wet tissue paper, obviously hoping that action will help cover up all the cracks.The dialogue is just as poor and nobody really comes off talking like a normal person. Of course with such a lacklustre collection of performances, it doesn't really matter so much what words they have to say. LaBeouf is so-so while Fox has a good body and a very impressive tan  neither of them would make me see one of her films again but I suppose pretty young actresses will never want for work (well, so long as everything is as tight as it is at age 21 I guess). Duhamel is bland and even Tyrese lacks spark. Voight and Turturro are both weak and seem even worse due to both of them having been much better than this. The voice work from Cullen, Ryan and others is a nice touch and mostly avoids being corny. The actors aren't helped by the messy direction from Bay. On one hand he is delivering a silly comedy, on the other it is an all-out action movie with a budget that could fund a small country. The comedy is more daft than funny and the romance side is just plain dumb. Action is delivered with a typical lack of restraint and lack of understanding for what makes engaging action  so instead we get the usual grand music and sweeping camera shots.Overall then, the film has loads of noise and lots of money right up there on the screen. However it doesn't have a good script, characters, performances, tension, excitement or memorable content. The summer crowd looking for noise, action and nothing else will find their boxes ticked, however those looking for more will find little.",Null,11,26,4 September 2007
Men in Black II," Quite fun as long as you know what to expect
","When alien Serleena returns to earth looking for `the light' that alluded her over 20 years ago, she takes control of MIB headquarters in order to flush out those who know where the light would be hidden.  Agent J heads out to recover Agent K, now living a normal live with no awareness of his past. K is the only person who knows where the light is and he and J follow clues he left years ago as he had removed the memory to protect himself.When I watched the first film I thought to myself that it was a film that looked like it was designed to spawn a sequel rather than be a film in it's own right.  A few years later and I was right.  This sequel basically tries to repeat the chemistry of the first film and to a certain degree succeeds. The plot is basically a rerun of the first film except with everything bigger.  Most of it works because it is short, punchy, funny and energetic  the jokes are mostly new and not straight lifts from the first film.  The characters have changed a little and it manages to pull off the same blockbuster humour that it had before.The effects are good but really it is the humour that drives it.  While much of it is amusing rather than hilarious, there are plenty of laugh out loud moments to keep it going.  Smith is slumming it here  he gives a sort of typical `urban attitude' play to things and says `your ass' a lot.  Want to see what money will do to someone? Watch him in 6 degrees of separation and then watch this!  Jones is the core of the film as he was before and is a great straightman. Smith carries 15 minutes and then wisely they bring back Jones.  Boyle is so-so, she doesn't have much to do to be fair.  Knoxville is alright I guess.  Dawson is good but I'm biased as I've liked her since Kids and He Got Game.  Torn and Shalhoub make good returns.Overall this is not rocket science  it is the original formula done again with bells on.  It won't win many awards for content but it is an entertaining, undemanding blockbuster that does what it says on the tin. Quite fun as long as you don't expect the world.",Null,0,3,19 April 2003
Wimbledon," Probably only of interest to die hard fans of modern British romantic comedies
","It has been many a year since Peter Colt was at the height of his powers. Now though he enters Wimbledon ranked 119th in the world and even the British public have given up cheering him. Deciding to retire out of the professional game after this tournament, Peter heads to London with hopes to go out with some dignity and maybe even get some column inches. On arrival though he stumbles into the room of American pro Lizzie Bradbury while she is in the shower. After some brief flirting they meet up later and continue, having fun before finding themselves in something more serious  but how will it affect their respective tournaments.Screened for the first time on UK terrestrial television during the 2007 Wimbledon tournament this romantic comedy had an element of the same easy scheduling that brought it to UK cinemas. In a way it is this sense of rather obvious convenience that pervades the whole affair because it is a bit like the writers have extracted elements of other British comedies and just rolled them into the British event of Wimbledon to top it all off. This painting-by-numbers approach does of course generate a reasonably OK film  just not one that really ever marks itself out as anything special. The plot sees a fairly unconvincing love affair being put as the base of a story that features a slightly more interesting (but no less predictable) rise of an Englishman making his way through the Wimbledon tournament. It pushes all the easy buttons and did produce a bit of interest for me and also the odd chuckle but nothing more than that.The main problem for me was the fact that I never gave a toss about the central relationship  not even once. The script is one reason for this but really one has to ask why Kristen Dunst thought that it was acceptable for someone of her fame to churn out a performance that any giggling starlet would be capable of. She is all surface and she gives nothing that suggests she is playing a real person  suffice to say she has no chemistry with Bettany. Which is a real shame because Bettany is actually pretty good and brings a lot of charisma and charm to the lead role. He makes his parts of the film interesting and I quite liked him as the leading man in this sort of thing. The support cast are mostly pointless, with Lindsay, Neill, McAvoy, Favreau and others just adding name value without actually having a lot to contribute as actors, although McEnroe was a good touch.Overall then a fairly obvious romantic comedy that doesn't offer much more than what you'd expect if you washed all the colour out of some of the better ones. Bettany's charisma does lift proceedings somewhat but there is little he can do with a poor script as his foundation and a smiley giggly sock showgirl as a co-star. One for genre fans only here.",Null,1,3,12 July 2007
Coco," Not perfect but colorful and with engaging themes and ideas - a bit too respectful and broad though
","My toddler means I don't watch a lot of films, but when I do then I tend to watch it over and over and over again. Over time I have tried to bump her to different things, even if only to get more diversity in the mix. Coco was one such film snuck into normal habits, and it was done because I'd not seen it myself. The film follows a young boy who is banned from playing music due to an ancestor who was a musician but left the family, and when he tries to steal a guitar to enter a Day of the Dead contest, he finds himself transported to the other side and needing the help of his family in getting him home.As is often the case with Pixar films, Coco deals with some difficult issues in a way that is accessible and not too challenging. In this case it is death and loss, and the film deserves credit for the way it gives messages of acceptance, of grief, and of memory. Coco is also notable for the cultural setting, which is unusual in such a mainstream film. The pressure of both of these things can be felt though, and while the film is pretty light and well balanced, it does feel a bit restrained by the pressure of being respectful and serious on its setting and themes. Perhaps related to this, the film is not as sharp in the narrative as Pixar at their best - it doesn't totally have the heart, laughs, or intelligence that an Up or Wall-E or Toy Story would bring to the table. For sure it is still a very good film, and is solid across the board, but it rarely rises above this - which is more than fine were it not for the film's own ancestors standing above it.",Null,0,1,9 March 2019
Lincoln," Patient and engaging while mostly avoiding sentimentality
","I approached this film with caution and did so for several reasons. First and foremost, this is Oscars season and this type of film is just what one expects to come out and be showered with Oscar buzz – and quite often these films are found to be lacking once they are out of this period and on their own. The second reason was related and it was that I didn't for a second think that this film would be able to go for more than two minutes without the heroic music coming up, a soft focus being slapped on the lens and someone giving a great speech about the morality of everything while the camera cuts to those around looking teary eyed and yet full of admiration. In other words I worried that this would simply be a more expensive version of The West Wing season 1.Although the film does rather fall into these traps occasionally, it is by no means seriously flawed since the majority of the film is patience and very well delivered. We focus on the final few years of Lincoln's life, specifically the period towards the end of the war where slavery was abolished by Constitutional amendment. As such the film is about political wrangling and the determination to stay the course with the goal even though it would be difficult and smart politics suggested to not risk the bigger prize (peace) at the expense of an aspiration. The film shows this very well and it manages to be patient without being slow – which is quite the achievement considering that the film is essentially men in rooms talking. The politicking was well delivered so that it wasn't dull but wasn't falsely sped up. The sentimentality is kept to a surprisingly low. It is still there of course and the camera frequently looks for a heroic frame and the music often reminds us the grandeur of what we are seeing, but it doesn't overdo it too much and certainly nowhere near the levels I feared.Day Lewis is perhaps a given for the Oscar. His Lincoln is certainly a spot on creation – he comes over as heroic and steadfast without being mythicalised by his own performance. He really gives an impression of the man's spirit throughout the film. The supporting cast is so deep in names and faces that it is hard to know where to start; being honest, at times I did find it a little distracting as a parade came across the screen – seemingly all from TV shows I watch or films I had seen, I suspect I could be quite far down the cast list before I found someone I couldn't place. Aside from this distracting a little, it does mean the cast is deep in talent and everyone does well. Tommy Lee Jones in particular adds passion and color to all his scenes and the film benefits from his performance. Field is perhaps not as good – although in fairness I didn't think the personal side to the story worked as well as the rest – and since this is her parts, maybe that is why I didn't like her performance as much. Spielberg's direction is very well paced; shots are very well picked and the camera is very patient in its movement.Lincoln didn't blow me away but it did quietly impress me. Part of the reason for this is that the film doesn't go all out for emotion or history or sentimentality, it simply lets it happen in the main and manages to keep these traps to a comparative minimum that really helps the film. It is long but never boring, respectful but never overly so.",Null,13,20,23 February 2013
Rules of Engagement," Interesting but too simplistic and lacking in courtroom sparks
","Years have past since Col Hodges and Col Childers were comrades in combat. Hodges is now retired while Childers is still on active service in the Middle East.  When he is called in to help protect and evacuate the US Embassy in the middle of a riot, Childers orders his men to return fire despite not having any definite targets.  With a crowd of 80 dead, many women and children, the authorities are forced to go after Childers to have someone to blame.  Childers turns to his old friend to help defend him.With a pair of real heavyweights in lead roles I was quite looking forward to this film.  It is quite easy to get into the film as the opening 40 minutes are pretty exciting and shocking in equal measure  it forces you to think where you stand on the action taken by Childers in both past and present.  However as the film goes on the moral debate becomes simplified and it is clear where we are being steered, as opposed to being allowed to think things out for ourselves.  The `debate' or thoughtful side is lost and we are left with the courtroom drama side of things.I'm not a big fan of courtroom thrillers as they often rely on unlikely twists at the end and lots of shouting in place of substance.  However I do enjoy the odd one if it hangs together and has energy.  However, the courtroom scenes here never really get off the ground and surprisingly (given the emotive subject) really lack energy and twists.  Even the conclusion of the film is a real damp squid, the verdict is simply delivered, so if you're expecting twists and turns and big revelations forget it.  Inexplicably, the film puts up two or three captions over the final shot to tell us more information  for some of these the film would have been much more exciting if it had worked these into the final 20 minutes of the film.  To have them as flat words on a screen is pointless (especially since this isn't a true story!).Jones and Jackson both do good work, as you'd expect for a pair of tough nuts such as they.  Jackson has the better character (until the script weakens itself).  Pearce is OK in support but the script doesn't give him too much to work with, his side of the case is easy of course, so the film stops him overpowering the court case at the same time as it simplifies it's stance.  Support from faces such as Kingsley, Archer, Greenwood and Underwood is OK but in some cases are so brief to be cameos.Overall this starts well, but it fairs to really involve once the moral debate side of the film is simplified and phased out.  The question `what would you do' is rendered null and void with each flashback Jackson has. The courtroom scenes barely fizzle let alone ignite the screen and the film putters to a poor ending that is badly done.  Worth seeing with good performances from the leads but still a pretty big disappointment.",Null,24,46,14 November 2003
Pi," Low key thriller that is interesting rather than intense or gripping
","Max Cohen is a mathematical and computer genius who seeks mathematical patterns in everything.  However he also suffers from intense headaches, dellusions and some paranoia.  He looks into patterns in the stock market only to find his ability sought by both a Wall Street trader, Marcy Dawson, and a Hasidic, Lenny Meyer, who both want the code for different reasons.Before I saw this I must admit I heard a lot of hype but no actual details  so I was half-expecting an intense `Usual Suspects' thriller mixed with maths.  So I was a little disappointed at first.  However once over my preconceptions I was able to settle into this.  That is, if you can `settle into' something like this.  The story is clever it plays on paranoia and delusion  in fact it may or may not happen.  Even at the end of the film I was left wondering if Max was a genius or if he was a nutter and all this was in his mind.  The film uses this paranoia to create some good scenes and the thumping base music ups the ante a bit.It's not an easy film to enjoy in the traditional sense, but it is an experience.  The subject matter is different enough to be interesting and the telling is clever  I for one can't wait to see what the director does with Batman: year one, it certainly won't be a camp Joel Schumacher film anyway!Gullette (who also co-wrote) is good in the lead and is totally convincing. Mark Margolis is also good and it's good to see him in different roles, I know him from his strong role in Oz although he's not as good here.  The rest of the cast are good  but really the star here is the director as he manages to put us in Max's mind and involve us in the paranoia so thoroughly that we're not sure what is real and what isn't.Overall this isn't as masterly as the hype suggests but it's different enough and compelling enough to be more than gripping for 90 minutes.",Null,18,26,28 March 2002
Children of Men," Engaging and exciting sci-fi that is interesting and technically impressive in its delivery
","It is the year 2027. For some reason mankind has gradually ceased being able to reproduce, with the last human born being 'baby' Diego in 2009. When he is murdered in a brutal attack it stuns the world, only further sapping the hope in a world where the aging population has given up, economies have collapsed, terrorism is rife and Governments are focused on control rather than improving anything for anyone. In the middle of this former activist Theo is approached to help transport a woman across checkpoints to the coast where the mysterious 'human project' is working to save mankind.Interesting to look back on some groups of films and see what they tell us about the times they were made in. The sci-fi's of the 1950's point to an external threat that is different from us and must be feared an conquered for example. It will be interesting to look back on Children of Men and other recent sci-fis such as V for Vendetta because already they seem so attuned with the world we now live in. Children of Men jumps just into the future to a world crumbling with no real hope for anyone other than those clinging to what little privilege power offers them. This is the strength of the film as it builds a futuristic world that is so palatable  remote from our own but yet so easy to believe. There are problems with the narrative in regards pitching it to a mass audience though. Many (including myself at times) will struggle with not understanding and knowing everything about this world.This did bother me at times but mostly the central story was exciting and interesting enough to engage  so what if the story doesn't fill in the whole history of where we are now, or if the film finishes where it does rather than giving us a firm conclusion? That is not the nature of the story and it is part of the telling. For something so downbeat and with these open aspects, the film does a great job of gripping. The background detail of this future makes for a strong foundation for Theo and Kee to move through, producing some interesting plot points but also a surprising amount of action. The ambush on Julian's car is exciting but it doesn't compare to the final scenes where Theo attempts to rescue Kee; not only is that scene gripping but it is technically very impressive as it is delivered in long, complex takes where you feel you get no respite. The script is not perfect though and some of it is clunky and not as intelligent as it thinks it is (lest we forget that this is script that calls the character holding the future of mankind 'Kee') but mostly it is very strong.Owen holds the film together with a central character that is hardly off the screen but yet we never tire of him. There are a lot of stars alongside him but he owns the film by far. Moore has a small turn that is effective albeit more because of her surprise fate rather than her amazing turn. Caine is amusing but is wisely kept to the sidelines while Ejiofor, Mullan, Huston and others all fill in the smaller characters. Ashitey is OK but not as strong as I would have liked; she didn't convince me in her skin and it was too easy to see her character as a plot device rather than a character. As director, Cuarón delivers the goods with an impressive group effort that makes this future so convincing and gritty. The sets are well done and London etc locations are subverted just in the right way to keep them real as well as different. Lubezki's cinematography is impressive throughout and personally, having seen both now, I think he should have had the Oscar that instead went to Pan's Labyrinth.Overall an intelligent and interest sci-fi that says a lot about the times we live now in how it views the future. Despite some issues with the script and total pot, the film is engaging and exciting, producing a credible and depressing future-view but also being a technically impressive film in regards the design and delivery.",Null,16,28,30 April 2007
The Football Factory," Convincingly real but mostly misses the interesting 'tribal' aspect that it could have explored  but claims of 'glamorisation' are really missing the point
","Tommy Johnson is just a normal bloke, working during the week for f*ck-all money, drinking his nights away looking to get laid and living for the weekend. At the weekend he comes alive with his involvement with his Chelsea firm. Kicking off against whoever, Tommy enjoys the sense of belonging and having that rush that the violence brings  but his life is headed for a change. Waking up in a girl's bed brings him into contact with her Millwall brother  only a cricket bat to the head gets him away safe. However when Chelsea draws Millwall away in the FA Cup it sets the stage for a great clash, but with guys after him and his dreams increasingly scary and unhinged, Tommy suspects the worst.When this film came out it was naturally met with the media coverage that comes with any film about this very English phenomenon and I decided to just avoid the hype and the hand-wringing and catch up with the film when I could approach it with a clear air. With its silent and unfussy release on DVD I decided I might as well give it a try. The film kicks off with Tommy's firm in a typically violent clash in which we learn of the appeal of the rush and the buzz as well as getting a feel for the characters. At this point I was happy enough because I was grateful that the film acknowledged the appeal of the hooliganism and to try and just pretend it has none would have been stupid. However no right minded person, even one that sees the appeal, could claim that it justifies it and I then looked for it to be more than just this. Although the film sort of starts to wander into the idea of the need for a tribe or a sense of belonging it generally just concentrates on the narrative rather than opening up the ideas.This is a problem because then all we have is a film that is some sort of drama around the world of football violence rather than a film that explores the lives involved. This is a shame because it could have been interesting but instead it just ends up wallowing in violence with only a vague subtext going on. This is not to say it glamorises it, only that it presents it as it is but fails to really critically analyse it. In this way it will still be as confusing and repulsive to the majority as it is when it is on the news, but to those involved in the real firms this will be seen as a great fun film  and that is a real shame.The cast are mostly just concerned with delivering swearing 'geezer' clichés and the film gives them no real opportunity to have greater depth than that.Dyer is a good lead who does occasionally bring out a bit of stuff with expressions and body language but mostly he fits the mould. Harper is just tough but his one scene of self-doubt shows he had more in him if he had been allowed to go further. The rest of the support cast just simply fall into cliché and lazy geezer accents with burberry for all!Overall this film was a disappointment in the way that it missed the deeper issues on the whole and just ended up being an depiction of violence without a great deal of depth to it. Worth seeing for a realistic depiction of football hooliganism but it doesn't do anything else beyond that. It may not glamorise or promote the life but it doesn't have the depth to criticise or analyse it in the way it really should have done.",Null,13,27,10 October 2004
Million Dollar Baby," A low key thoughtful piece that pleases by turning away from what we expect
","Frankie Dunn is a grizzled boxing trainer who tries his best to protect his fighters from the pressure of the big shot and prepare them as well as he can. When his most recent hope abandons him for a title shot Frankie is downcast to the point where he humours a hopeless gym regular, Maggie Fitzgerald by agreeing to train her. After a short time her potential is obvious and Frankie starts her out in minor bouts where she is so successful at knocking her opponents out that she struggles to get more bouts arranged. With the big time beckoning, can Maggie continue this trend to her title shot and can Frankie trust her enough to let her try?My plot summary makes this sound like a very tired and clichéd sports movie then that is intentional because that it how it sounded to me when I heard about it; having seen Girlfight recently I wondered why I should bother with what sounds essentially like a retread of that. And for the majority of the film this is what it appeared to be albeit it a pretty professional and enjoyable genre film. However at some point during the film it moves away from the genre formula and becomes something much more interesting. I won't spoil anything but the plot becomes much more low key and interesting  suffice to say this is not just a clichéd sports movie. However this doesn't mean that it is a brilliant film and I must admit to being a little bewildered by the high praise that everyone seems to be heaping onto it. Lets not forget that it is a genre film for the vast majority and only stands out due to consistent good touches and the different direction at the end making it better. It is all interesting and surprisingly low key but don't expect to be totally blown away  it isn't that sort of film.The acting is very good and I would suggest that Swank is looking at a second Best Actress Oscar for this simply because we is as good early on as she is at the end and adds character to her performance  a whole history with her family build in just one or two scenes, thanks mainly to her performance. Eastwood is the same  a clichéd character made better by hints of deeper issues; I would have liked more time with him in the film to get to know what has brought him here, but he is good considering the limits he is working within. Freeman is also limited to a very small role but is still pretty good although at times his narration was a bit too much and I felt it was over used  a small mercy was that, when the film became most thoughtful, the narration is significantly dropped to a minimum and we are trusted to think for ourselves.Overall this is not a perfect film but it is a pretty good one. It is 70% the sports cliché that you expect it to be and 30% something different that is a lot darker, low key and interesting. This is an uneasy mix and doesn't totally work  and changing 30% of a genre movie isn't enough to make me cheer from the rooftops about it but I did enjoy it nonetheless.",Null,7,25,17 January 2005
Garden State," Too knowingly quirky and a bit up itself but still entertaining with a heart visible under the 'kookiness'
","Andrew Largeman is an 'actor' in Hollywood, meaning that he has had a small part in a TV show and is currently a waiter. When his mother dies, he is forced to return home and see the father that has kept him medicated since he was aged 10. His return home causes him to examine his life even though he still cannot really feel anything; it also allows him to hook up with old friends as well as meeting new ones  namely the beautiful but strange Sam.It is perhaps ironic that the same qualities that attracted me to this film were the same qualities that I felt weakened it as a total film: these qualities were that it appeared a bit kooky and introspective. With several films of 2004 having mined this seam to great success, Garden State could be accused of being just an attempt to clone that by convey the malaise of twenty-somethings and, in fairness, it doesn't really help itself in the way it tends to overdo the aforementioned qualities. I do like films that are touching and introspective but they are best where they involve very real characters (or emotions); here the malaise is drug-induced and the situations all feel overdone and exaggerated. This is mirrored in the way the film knowingly does everything in a quirky manner and never misses a chance to make things more 'off-kilter'; for example our character drives an unusual vehicle, Sam has an African brother, there is a bottomless pit in Newark and so on. There is nothing terribly wrong with this but at times I did wish that it would tone down the 'kookiness' and just get down to looking at the characters.It still manages to do this but it does it despite the kookiness and not as a result of it. The characters are still well enough written that you do recognise them at least in small part and should be able to find part of their feelings that you can relate to or at least empathise with. When it works it works very well and I can understand so many moody youths have taken this film to their hearts; however at other times it doesn't manage to bring out characters or develop the story in a manner that will be as touching as it could have been if it had set itself in a much less kooky world. As writer and director, Braff must bare responsibility for these faults but then he deserves much more in the way of praise for all the things he does well  his direction is assured and has plenty of style, his choice of soundtrack is hardly earth shattering but suits his material and, despite the flaws, his writing is still an impressive debut. As actor though he is only so-so; it may be realistic for his character but am I the only person who dislikes raised inflections. He downplays his stuff and he does well, letting the rest of the cast shine.In particular Natalie Portman digs her way deeper into my heart with a great performance. At times she comes close to failing but mostly she even manages to keep her character really likable and not get buried beneath the quirks. Not only is she beautiful but her vulnerability is well delivered as well as her sense of humour and fun; when she is on screen it is hard to not focus on her. Sarsgaard is a great young actor who is building up a collection of good performances. This film gives him less to do than it really should have done but he is still watchable and does well with what he has been given. Support is good from Holm, Dowd and Method Man (yes, you heard me right) but really the film is Portman's and she takes to it with a light, natural air that made me forget that I'll probably have to cope with another wooden performance from her in Star Wars 3 in a few months.Overall this is a good film but not as great as people seem to think. The story is good and the characters are, in essence, well written, but it just feels like it was really pushing for the 'kooky' niche that had been hit by Lost in Translation and The Station Agent. At times it could have scaled back the quirks and concentrated on the characters to produce a better film but even with this flaw it still works well and will be enjoyed by fans of the aforementioned films and introspective young people.",Null,11,23,21 December 2004
Donnie Brasco," A good gangster film with strong emotional under currents
","In the late 1970's, FBI agent Joe Pistone poses as jewel expert Donnie Brasco to win the trust of ageing mob middleman Lefty Ruggiero.  As time passes Donnie gets tighter and tighter into the mob, rising up when boss Sonny Black gets bumped up.  While Donnie puts his life at risk, his real life crumbles as he never sees his wife or children.  As he moves upwards, his friend Lefty is bypassed time and time again.  As Donnie gets deeper, the FBI start to worry and want to extract him - something that cannot be done without exposing himself and condemning Lefty to death.Now that Pirates of the Caribean has made him a bankable star as well as a good actor I decided to dig out some of my old Depp videos and watch them. I have been a Depp fan since the mid-90's when I saw Arizona Dream, Ed Wood and Don Juan all in a period of 6 months -I realised then that this was not only a very talented guy but also one who seemed happy to do whatever interested him rather than whatever was going to make money.  This film is in a well known and fairly reliable genre - the Italian American gangster movie but has the strength that it is an engaging true story.  The plot follows Joe as he gets in deeper, is suspected, gets involved in battles between bosses and eventually starts to lose himself and forget what side he is actually on.  Even though this is a true story, it still basically goes where we expect mob films to go, but it manages to rise above the clichés by having some very good characters and emotional themes.The whole gangster thing works and is gripping, but it is the relationship dynamics between Joe and Lefty that made it more interesting.  The element of going `native' when undercover has been done plenty of times, but it is the combination of this being fact and Depp's great performance that makes it work well here; we feel for Joe a great deal.  On the flipside the film also allows us to feel for the mob, or at least one of them.  The majority of the mobsters are the usual stereotypes but Lefty is written with a great deal of sympathy - he is a middleman, taking the risks, doing the dirt but always passed over and having to beg money to keep his bosses happy. These are tragic characters and the film is not the slightly glamorous gangster lifestyle that Pacino has experienced in his Godfather roles.  These two characters are well written and it is their subplots that makes the film better than the central plot (which itself is also very good).Depp is good and his performance is solid even if it doesn't really rank up their with his best - he lacks his usual flair but he gives the material it's dues.  Pacino is of course, wonderful.  His character is a far cry from his Godfather work and he manages to bring such pathos to Lefty that it is impossible not to feel for him.  The support cast may not have as much in the way of character but they all do well in their roles.  Madsen, Kirby, Ivanek, Heche, Miano and others all give good support, but it is Pacino and Depp's film - which is a good thing.Overall, the fact that this is a true story makes it more interesting but, while I was watching it I wasn't really thinking about it and was just enjoying the gangster film itself.  The basic story is a well worn one but is still delivery well by Newell (who was a very unusual choice for director), but it is the emotion threads involving Joe and Lefty that make the film much more than just another gangster film.",Null,121,142,2 May 2004
Casualties of War," Some good touches but far too polarised, simplistic and at the end - cheesy
","`Cherry' Erikson arrives in Nam and is assigned to Sgt Meserve's unit. When they can't get into town to go to a whore house on the eve of a long patrol, Meserve kidnaps a Vietnamese girl to take on the patrol and use for sex.  Erikson is forced to take a stand in the face of rape and brutality that he can't believe  however what's a crime in war time?De Palma is a great director when he's on form  untouchables is a class film and Snake Eyes shows that he can rise above material to deliver style. However here he has no action set pieces to work with and the real drama is a moral one.  This causes him to fall down by painting too simplistic a picture of good and evil.  The story follows Sgt Meserve's hate driven unit as they capture a girl to service them sexually while on patrol.  New member Erikson is portrayed far too wide eyed and innocent and the gap between the two men makes it too much to accept  it takes away the very element of debate and merely tells us what we already know.The official denial of the event is helped by Ving Rhames explanation of justice, but other than this it's all too black and white.  The simplistic nature continues right up till the ending where Fox achieves some sort of closure by meeting a young girl on an university campus years later.  De Palma delivers horrible visions and disturbing scenes of rape and brutality  but outside of the shock value there's nothing to do but shake your head and say `how could this have happened'.Despite their characters the cast are good  Penn is powerfully convincing as Meserve and Fox manages to carry the wide-eyed youth easily.  The support cast is made up of quality  John C Reilly, Leguizamo and Rhames head it up and all three are on top form.Overall, it's a powerful film and you can't help but be moved by the cruelity and injustice inflicted upon the Vietnamese girl.  But with the moral debate of wartime atrocities reduced to a picture of black and white then it can get a bit dull at times.",Null,2,8,16 March 2002
Event Horizon," Haunted house movie in space  has good bits and bad bits
","When the space ship the Event Horizon returns, having gone missing, without it's crew a mission is sent to investigate.  However the location of the ship is a mystery and strange things begin to happen on board.  When more people begin to die and some begin to change character and hellish visions become rampant Captain Miller begins to suspect where the ship has been.The debut of Paul Anderson as director in Shopping should have told everyone that here is a man who doesn't need a good plot  he only needs flashy visual style to cover the gaps.  Mortal Kombat backed that up and Soldier showed that he can't always cover the gaps!  Event Horizon falls somewhere in the middle.  The plot and action is semi-lifted from various places.  The space stuff seems like Alien, the haunted house stuff and horror is Hellraiser.  That said it still has creepy bits and good bits.The problem is that it doesn't all work and what you're left with is a very gory movie with lots of cool stuff happening visually but not much substance plot wise.  The buildup is good but once it all starts going to hell (literally) in the second half and everyone stars dying, it just because style without bones.The cast help.  Neill is good but hams it up a it towards the end. Fishburne is great throughout and you can't help but like him  the rest of the film may be falling down towards the end but his parts are like stone  solid no matter what.  The rest of the cast are OK but can't compare to either of the two lead men  especially Lawrence.Overall this starts with some good atmosphere but later falls into gore without substance.  However it does have it's good bits and Lawrence Fishburne makes the whole thing worth watching with a performance that holds the whole damn thing together.",Null,8,15,6 July 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Wonderfully imaginative animation, fun & intelligent songs make for a great family film for all but the youngest children
","Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King Â– the creative genius behind the holiday of Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrible than the one before. However deep inside he longs for more than the horror and scares of Halloween Town, a longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes of which has evaded him all these years. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas all the time. But the others in the towns realize the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.With Pixar currently dominating the world of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film to the cinema using a much more traditional animation and a huge amount of imagination. The basic plot is a great little fantasy fairytale with a very dark heart to it that make it much more enjoyable for having that edge. Too often kids films (especially at the time and animated) are soaked in a sweet sentiment that simply forgets that kids are not stupid and indeed often prefer a bit of darkness in the story. The only downside of this darkness is that younger children might not 'get it' and just end up being scared by the Halloween images and imaginative images. Despite this the material will play equally well to adults and children because it neither panders to nor excludes one group over the other at any time. Regardless of the material, the film still manages to come off as charming and enjoyable thanks to a well-written script that never plays for the basic laugh or easy sentiment. Some viewers may come to this with Pixar in their minds and bemoan it for not being hilariously funny from start to finish, but they are missing the point andThe songs reflect this approach and are very clever throughout; whether it is the sorrowful longing of Jack at the start or the Cab Calloway-inspired song from Oogie Boogie Man, generally they are inventive and fun. The same praise can be laid at the door of the stop-motion animation, which is inventive and fun to look at from start to finish. All the characters have a great deal of effort put in and they add to the dark feel of the film. The voice cast may not feature a load of well-known voices in the same way as Pixar films generally do, but they still do a great job. Sarandon and Elfman combine to do a good job with Jack; Page is fun as Oogie Boogie; O'Hara is good as Sally despite not having as fun a character to work with but for my money it is Hickey (as Dr Finklestein) and Shadix (Mayor) that make the biggest impression, mainly due to having the most enjoyable characters.Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (with the same material) and never ignores or panders to one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairytale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered even as kids movie get smarter and fancier.",Null,103,115,2 November 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Fascinating film with great acting and directing that works as basic history lesson and social commentary
","The story of a young man ejected from the Air Force because he refused to disown his father for once reading a 'communist' publication comes to the attention of the newsman Edward R Murrow and his team at CBS. Despite the concerns of the corporation and the sponsors, Alcoa, Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly decide to run with it and attack the fact that there was no evidence, no proper trial and that the whole event is a knee-jerk reactionary piece of fear mongering from Senator McCarthy. This begins the conflict between McCarthy and the CBS team where all the pressure on Murrow and Friendly is to soften their reports and go with the flow.I always liked George Clooney as an actor even if I think he relied on that hangdog charm a bit too much to get him out of ER and into a cinema career. But with recent years he has impressed me more and more with his intelligence and his determination to do more with his chances than just churn out average action thrillers  not to say he hasn't done those too but recently he has sought to do more with his money and fame. It helps that I am more on the left of centre than the right but generally I respect his stance. This film is a good example because he has delivered a story that engages and fascinates as it educates and challenges. If this sounds a little full of itself then perhaps you are right because those with more of a right wing leaning will perhaps feel that it is being smug, overbearing and simplistic; as I tended to agree with its targets I cannot comment but personally I felt that it was no more or less critical than it needed to be.The story opens with a potted summary of the time and then jumps right into the start of the battle between Murrow and McCarthy. From here on it was intensely interesting and covered the action at the time while also giving plenty of food for thought for modern times (although not in an obvious or obtrusive manner). The narrative is fascinating and it does a great job of recreating the time and using archive footage blended really well. Clooney also handles the theme really well that the media and the people need to be able to hold their Government up for criticism and inspection and the inability to do that is totally against the idea of democracy; this is most obvious in the story we are being told (where it was easier to keep your head down) but you do not need to look too far in recent years to see how the story is still applicable now. As director Clooney is excellent and the only criticism is that he maybe over-directs, by which I mean that there is not a shot in the film where I didn't think 'they've done a good job with that'; but this is as weak a criticism as it sounds. The black & white looks fantastic, the lighting is great and the framing of shots is expertly done, mixing flowing motions with static long looks. The running time also shows a discipline in the production as it is at its best for being punchy  it stops it becoming preachy or labouring the point.The cast are excellent both on paper and in reality, although many have quite small roles. Stratharim is excellent with his convincing newsman  I don't know the real person but he really works within the film. Clooney brings his charm to the piece well but doesn't push himself forward like some others might have done. The support cast have limited time on screen but they are all really good and the number of well-known faces just adds to the feeling of depth. Clarkson, Wise, Langella, Downey Jr, Daniels and others all hit the mark just right and I was surprised by how deep with quality the film really did feel.Overall this is an excellent little film that gives a potted history of the period in a fascinating and punchy fashion while also challenging the audience to have a thing about the current state of affairs. It is deep with talent, looks great and mostly avoids the smug overbearing approach that a lesser film might have had. The ending is also encouragingly downbeat and makes sure that we know there are no easy answers to the problems and that a bigger change is needed than a few good men doing the right thing.",Null,3,5,19 March 2006
Big Hero 6," Big, bright and cheerful, even if it doesn't manage its heart well, and ultimately turns into another Marvel film for the second half
","I watched this film at a strange time in terms of its reception; before its Oscar win it seemed to be a film that most people enjoyed or really enjoyed, however once it won Best Animated Feature, there seemed to be quite the backlash against it. I tried not to pay too much attention to either camp and went into the film for myself. The plot is driven by a device that seems to be quite common and one that more children's films are using – which is death and loss. In this case we have the main character and main villain motivated by the loss of a loved one, and this is what leads them to their respective points. This is something that can be tremendously impacting and also done very well (How to Train Your Dragon 2, for example) but in this case I thought it was a bit too much, too soon – introducing darkness for children, but only being a plot device to adult viewers. I guess the good thing is that at least it occurs early in the film so is out of the way.From here we get some nice comedy with the lovable Baymax as well as a superhero origin plot, although by far the former is better than the latter. The film from here is much brighter and funnier than some would suggest, and I generally enjoyed what it did, even if it still continued to really be able to balance the heart of the piece. This balancing act is pretty much forgotten by the final third, where it becomes much more a Marvel film than a Disney one. Feeling a touch like Captain America or some film like this, the action sequence and rapid movement is engaging and entertaining, but it does feel like just another action movie whereas the first half of the film felt like much more of a family comedy. These conflicting tones and contents never really gel the way they should, but mostly it works.Technically the film is astounding. The animation is fantastic in its scale and detail, from the expanse of the city through to the smooth, soft likability of Baymax himself. Okay Hiro looks far too much like he is the lead from How to Train Your Dragon, but otherwise all the characters and action is very well delivered. The very high production standards, good comedy moments, and fast-moving energy in a simple frame all do produce a perfectly fun and entertaining film on the whole, but it is one I enjoyed watching rather than one I would rush back to see again and again. The use of loss and death never feels like more than a plot device, and the heart of the piece is a lot less evident than it would have been in a better film – which is not to say I did not enjoy it for the things it did, just that it is a lot more limited than we have come to expect from huge budget animated family films.",Null,10,19,7 March 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Distracting enough for undemanding genre fans
","With the virus breaking out of the 'secure' Hive, the Umbrella Corporation order Racoon City to be sealed off and isolated  even if it traps most of the residents inside with the undead infected. The Corporation's scientists are all evacuated, with the exception of one who has lost his daughter within the city. He refuses to leave and turns to the only member of the Corporation's staff still left inside for help  this person being none other than Alice. Joining a band of armed survivors, things don't look good with Alice running out of time - but then the Corporation take the decision, to protect their stockholders and executives, that the city will be destroyed by a nuclear strike at dawn. Meanwhile they take the opportunity to release the Nemesis programme into the city to test its effectiveness.Although the first film was not actually any good, it still did enough to please those who knew what they were getting into when they sat to watch it, and enough of the target audience must have gone to see it to justify a sequel a few years later. Despite clearly having a wider playpen within the story, film doesn't feel like a massive budget has been poured into it in some areas. Specifically the plot and dialogue are pretty weak; the attempt to escape Racoon City has a few things piled onto it to try and up the ante but none of them really ring true and it mainly comes off feeling like the narrative was an afterthought. This is backed up by the poor dialogue and total lack of characterisation in all areas. Of course if you are target audience for this film then it seems unlikely that such things will matter to you and it probably does what you need it to do. There are fights, zombies, big guns, things going bang and men in monster suits. None of it is anything special but it is noisy enough for the teenage male target audience.As with the first film, the theme of the big corporation is not used that well and, although it is stated how evil the company is, we are never really given a sense of them in the same way as some other 'sinister forces at work' movies have done. The direction makes it all look slick enough but forgets to add the horror and tension that it really should have had. Jovovich is pretty handy but throwing in the odd scene where she looks angry and hurt over her past is not a replacement for delivering a character. The rest of the cast are pretty low rent and make the cast in the first film look better. Guillory is a 'feisty action woman' who looks like she is from the same cookie cutter that produced Buffy, Charmed, Alias and a hundred others, she does the basics and no more. Likewise Epps, Fehr, Vavasseur and others just play their roles without having any real charisma or anything different, although Epps is actually quite amusing in the outtakes on the DVD! Overall this did what I expected it to do  it was noisy, uninteresting and par for the genre course at best. It has an audience of course and I guess some sections of that will enjoy it but not that many.",Null,3,8,22 April 2005
Mulholland Drive," Great for Lynch fans  but many will be frustrated at the (seeming) lack of cohesion and explanation and be frustrated at the amount of work that needs to be done to watch this film
","Irene is in a car accident and stumbles out towards the city as the only survivor and having lost her memory.  She hides in the flat of Betty's aunt as she leaves the city.  Betty is an innocent aspiring actress who arrives in LA to borrow her aunt's flat as she tries to `make it' in Hollywood. Betty tries to help Irene remember who she is and the trail begins with the large wads of money in her purse.  They follow the trail that leads to more confusion.  Meanwhile a director, Kesher, is under significant and sinister force to cast a certain lady in the lead of his film in a situation that goes beyond his comprehension.I had only heard good things about this film and was exciting to see it have a repeat showing recently at a local art cinema.  I knew that at some point in the film it goes haywire and is hard to follow, but I didn't realise just how LITTLE sense it would actually make!  I am still struggling now to try and piece it together  trying to work out how all the strands fit together and also which are real and which are not  if any!  This is part of the reason I enjoyed the film  it engaged my brain.  If you don't pay attention you don't stand a chance  even fully focused I was getting lost by the end.This is a typical Lynch film  weird, unsettling and not always making sense.  His direction is superb.  The whole film has a sinister, discomforting feel to menace to it.  From his flash edits to his use of Twin Peaks' style velvet curtains and weird characters, the whole thing feels uncomfortable and on-edge.  I'm not always a fan of his work but here I was spell bound.  The story is confusing, almost deliberately so, but the telling is masterful.  I felt like I was only in the cinema for an hour  it went so fast.  I was spell bound with a sort of breathless wonder as to where the story was going.  The downside was that it is slightly frustrating to be left with no concrete answers at the end.  For me the ride and the way my brain has been left working made it worthwhile but I suspect many viewers will either be bemused or frustrated by the incoherence in the film.  The more I think about it the more I see how cleverly layered the film is  I think I have found the `real' element of the story but I can't discuss it without spoilers and these pages are already full of ideas and theories without me adding to them.  Suffice to say that things in the `real' story echo through the rest giving you clues to the real bits.The two leads are very good.  Watts especially impresses as her character changes throughout the film well.  Bates is good but in later stages appears to be more focused on using her chest than her skills.  Theroux is a typically Lynchian actor and does well, but the real gold is in the raft of strange characters who float around most whose significance are never fully explained (if at all).  The tramp `who is causing all this', the cowboy, the guys in the diner, the sinister movie executives.  All add layers to Lynch's disturbing story.Overall I really enjoyed this film.  I enjoyed it afterwards, thinking about it.  I enjoyed surfing the net and talking to friends about it.  More than everything I enjoyed the sheer experience of watching the film.  The plot will grip you (but don't get frustrated  be patient and be ready to think for hours after) and the sheer unsettling nature of Lynch's direction will make you as uneasy and as frightened as the male dreamer in the diner describes himself to be as he confronts `the beast' which is the truth behind the whole damn thing.  Simply wonderful but not for everyone.",Null,9,23,9 January 2003
Grave of the Fireflies," Beautiful and haunting (suggestive spoilers)
","Being the only film from Ghibili film that Disney didn't buy suggested to me that this was either so bad they didn't want it or for some reason something that the makers felt was too special to them to sell off with the rest of the films. (This is not to suggest that the other Ghibili's have been cheapened by Disney because mostly I think they have done a very good job on the majority of them). Knowing the quality of the Ghibili studio, I had good faith that this would be a good film and I was pleased to find myself drawn into a small-scale look at the WW2 as it had its impact on two children living in Japan. Seita finds himself looking after younger sister Setsuko while his father fights and his mother is killed in a bombing raid. The story follows them as they try to survive alone while rationing and bombing limits their access to food.In a way it isn't that general a film about suffering in a war torn country because the story is quite specific but this does not limit its impact or value. The script and the deliver produce strong characters in Seita and Setsuko and they make it easy to get involved with them and care for what happens to them. In this regard it is a tremendously strong film because as it tears the hearts out of our characters it equally rips at the viewer. It is more than the basic 'war is hell' stuff and I must confess I appreciated just how 'human' a story it was. Setsuko is the type of wonderful child that I wish more American films could get instead of the precocious brats they mostly cast  she is beautiful and full of life (thanks in part to the voice work of Shiraishi) and it makes it all the more crushing to see her lose that spark as the film progresses. Seita is as good a character in a different way and he too is well brought out by Tatsumi.The animation is amazing and I did have to keep reminding myself that this was made over 15 years ago because it still looks impressive years later. It captures the heart of the character and has rich backgrounds and detail. It is easy to see why some reviewers have got so worked up over others referring to this as a 'cartoon'! Overall then this is an engaging and memorable film whose strength comes from many aspects  animation, characters, heart, all these things gripped me and hurt me. It doesn't make wider points about war and conflict, it simply focuses on the effects it has on these two specific children and it is all the more impacting for it.",Null,2,3,5 November 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Solid family-level film with a light touch but good impact
","It is odd to watch this film because all at once I felt it did a good job while also feeling that it was simply nowhere near as horrific as it needed to be. The story sees a young boy move into the country with his family, his father being a senior soldier in Hitler's Germany. At his new home the boy is bored without friends to play with, but meets a young boy on the other side of a fence who is sitting around in his pyjamas; over time they become good friends.The film is aimed at the family audience; parents with older children who can deal with the subject matter but perhaps are coming to it for the first time. As such it is very well pitched because it does unfold gently and it does explain things and show things in an accessible, understandable but yet still upsetting way. By focusing on the character of Bruno we get this perspective and it allows the rest of the film to be delivered in this same way – through a certain innocence and lack of understanding which comes with being a child. I mostly liked this approach because it is true that nobody is born hating or fearing anyone – these are things we learn or develop and Bruno is sitting in that area before this happens. The downside of this approach is that the film does feel a little softer than the reality and the general delivery seeks to upset but never shock, meaning that visually and tonally the film is a lot gentler than many adult Holocaust films. This is a flaw for an adult viewer, but it is a necessary flaw because it is aimed at a wider audience and as such it works, but it does feel weird to watch the film as an adult (knowing the reality) and yet find it accessible and innocent in its tone.The cast match this, mostly playing light and allowing suggestion to be their tool. Butterfield and Scanlon are very good; natural and chatty despite the material and convincing as children in the middle of this terrible hate. Thewlis is solid in the father role while Farmiga provides an accessible reaction to the horrors of the reality and as such is a key performance in the film to deliver this. The supporting cast are all decent but really the film is the two boys sitting with only man-made things between them.Overall this is an accessible and emotionally impacting look at the Holocaust, using the innocence of childhood well. This creates the flaw of being more accessible than the subject really should be in reality and I did feel a certain discomfort while watching, feeling that I shouldn't be finding bits of it easy to watch. This does pay off though by being easier for more viewers and by highlighting the innocence and in the end the emotional impact is the same. Not a perfect film by any means, but one that sets out its goal and achieves it.",Null,2,3,8 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Visually impressive, but surprisingly sterile
","I'd heard lots of good things about this film before coming to it; in particular with its darker tone being comparable to Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps this slightly hyped expectation is what led to the film being quite the disappointment. There is an attempt at darker material here, while also shadowing what has gone before, but mostly it feels like a production line film, rather than something made with real energy and risk. That feeling is not anti-Disney for the sake of it (I get most of my entertainment from massive corporations seeking to make money) but certainly part of that is the weight and ease of the franchise, and how it impacts the film.Picking up after the previous film, we find the rebellion on the run while a new Jedi seeks out an old master - so essentially Empire. Within this there is a lot of action and impressive special effects, but surprisingly little in the way of emotional impact - even the previous film has it outstripped on that front. I found the characters pretty bland in the most part, and was surprised by the use of the main characters to essentially do stupid things and waste everyone's time. The moments of conflict have some strengths but there isn't as much human drama there as one would have liked. The action sequences are good in terms of bang for buck, but they don't draw you into them as much as I would have liked.The cast are mixed. Driver remains good and deserves more. Ridley is pretty non-descript here, although the script gives her so little. Boyega doesn't quite have the spark he usually has, and his chemistry with Tran's Rose is pretty non-existent. Hamill is good and has the most to do. The other characters tend not to make much of an impact; majorly significant characters are forgotten or moved aside, and generally he plot goes where it wants to go. In this way the narrative is fine in the grand sweep, but in any specific detail or action it tends not to make sense or to be lazy in the writing.Last Jedi gives you lots of spectacle for your money, and there is enough to it to be entertaining for a few hours; however it is surprisingly sterile. It lacks emotional punch or weight, and plays out even its darker moments in a way that feels designed by committee and lacking rough edges or any sort.",Null,14,28,24 March 2018
Brave," Not Pixar at its best but still intelligent, engaging and entertaining
","I'm not sure why I let Brave pass me by for as long as I have. Perhaps it was the general impression that Pixar is falling off its game since the merge with Disney or just that the mother/daughter theme probably wouldn't appeal to me. Whatever the reason I watched it recently and, while not the bet that Pixar have offered, it is certainly no 'Cars' either. The plot sees a Scottish princess frustrated that her fate is one of marriage and goes against her mother's wishes to be more the self she wants to be. At this point the film employs a rather unusual plot device to force mother and daughter together and force them both to come together and accept one another. The device didn't really work for me but it was nicely done so I went with it.Although from here there is a lot of device-related action, it never loses sight of the central theme of the mother and daughter, in particular the daughter finding her own path but doing so with the mother rather than despite her. This is mostly nicely done and I was surprised by how some of it was quite moving. Again it doesn't bring the emotional punch that Up, Wall-E and others did, but it still works as more than what it appears to be on the face of it. The comedy is also refreshingly free of pop-culture references as well, which I do enjoy a bit of but sometimes it is nice to just get an entertaining and well told story without all the knowing nods and winks.The voice cast is pretty unimaginative in terms of casting since it seems that someone wrote a list of people with Scottish accents and then worked down that. That said, they are all good so this isn't a problem. Macdonald leads the cast really well and makes for a very positive wee character. Connolly, Coltrane, Ferguson, Thompson and others are all good in support and generally make the most of the material.Brave may not be up to the level of Pixar at its best but this isn't Cars or anything like that. It has intelligent content and heart, even if the narrative device didn't totally convince me.",Null,1,1,3 November 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Generally funny and entertaining, helping it get over the occasional more serious hump
","A lot of articles have been written about just how many comic-book hero movies there are in the market and planned for the coming years; they talk about viewer fatigue and market saturation and other such terms. They perhaps have a point but it is hard to really pay it much mind when the genre produces films which are fun and entertaining. With its massive success and the fact that it comes with association to already successful franchises, Guardians of the Galaxy perhaps looks like an easy film, but I do wonder how much people were taking a risk when they greenlit a sci-fi film based on an pretty much unknown comic book series, with a lot of things that could potentially have been really silly; seeing Howard the Duck in here is also a reminder of how something that is quite cool in theory can fail to connect to the audience. What makes it work though is that it is really light fun, easy to get lost in because you are laughing or smiling for the majority of it. It is at its best when the main characters are allowed to do their thing, with the best laughs coming from the banter between them (who would have thought that wrestler Bautista would have such great comic timing). The silliness is kept at bay by how tightly funny it is; it is sharp, daft, cool and engaging. The actors do well, with Pratt being charming fun, Saldana being more than just a figure, Cooper having a lot of presence with his voice, Bautista getting lots of laughs with his straight delivery, while Vin Diesel (who must have wondering if they were making fun of him with this casting) produces one of the most lovable characters with only a few lines of dialogue.While the cast have good timing, it should also be said that the film does too – for example cutting away briefly during an action sequence for one line to get a good laugh. The film unfortunately is not quite as strong when it has more serious or narrative driven moments. The opening of the film is a good example of this, but it is just as relevant during more intense moments or serious 'franchise' moments, because it still needs to be a film. The mix just about works, and the laughs, fun and cool silliness carry it across moments where it has none of this.It is not a work of art, and it is not as remarkable or brilliant as some would have you believe, but it is still very entertaining. In a genre filled with action-packed but overly serious films, or films that are just silly in a bad way, it is quite refreshing to be able to watch such a film, laugh all the way through it and come out having enjoyed it a lot for how well it balances, judges and delivers the humor consistently.",Null,10,16,15 November 2014
The Imitation Game," A good tale with a fine lead performance, even if it doesn't delve into details, or worry too much about historical accuracy
","I watched another film about the Enigma code recently, and it reminded me that I had not yet seen this one. It is a story I was broadly aware of – not to the point of having read the book, but certainly knowing the general sweep of the events. In a way this does suit the film, because it does brush across the main events in the life of Turning, rather than really delve too deeply into specifics. So we get key childhood moments, the stresses and moral conundrums of breaking the code, and of course his horrific treatment and death due to his sexuality.With this approach the film is actually very well structured as it mixes the global and the personal, as well as combining several running time periods (in a nicely edited construction). As such it is a solid and engaging story, which manages to fold together the central impact made by Turning, the roots of some of his character, and the sad treatment of him at the (early) end of his life. Of course as with any biopic, the film runs a lot together, simplifies wherever it can, and I guess probably will bother those that know the source material / real story inside out (as these things always do). For me I am always happy for such sacrifices being done in the name of a good story, just so long as the film does a good job of telling that story (it is not a documentary, and there are plenty of sources for that). In the case of this film, I think it works, because it is well told and engaging.The lead performance from Cumberbatch is the hook that a lot of it hangs on. He is convincing in his awkward difficultness but yet genius. He is perhaps not particularly well supported by Knightley, although to be fair this is not just down to her but perhaps more to do with how generic her character is. Outside of these two, the supporting turns are solid from those such as Kinnear, Strong, Dance, Goode, Leech, and others. Production values are high throughout, and the direction manages to get a lot of tension out of people in a room thinking – which is pretty hard to deliver as a cinematic experience.All told, it is a handsomely crafted film, with a fine lead performance, and a story that, although probably greatly simplified, is well told and engaging.",Null,0,0,26 December 2015
Caddyshack," Some funny moments  but really just quite vulgar
","At an exclusive golf club the staff are put down and underpaid.  Danny is underpaid but is looked after by the various members as he saves for college.  The arrival of the abusive Al Czervik causes tension at the club  but really it's just one of many crazy happenings.Everyone seems to have fond memories of this film  I know before I watched it recently I thought it better than it was.  It does have some funny bits but not the majority.  The plot is hidden so deep I can't really remember what Danny's role actually was in the film.  However plot doesn't matter much in this type of thing as it only matters if it's funny.  Some of it is. Carl's war with an absurd stuffed gopher is basic but works, while Rodney Dangerfield is always good if you like his brash style (I do).  However it is also full of vulgar jokes about vomit or floating turds.  To make it sellable we even get nudity thrown in  how very inventive!This vulgar streak takes away from a film that does feel quite breezy and fuuny at times.  Chase is good  yes, I said it!  Dangerfield is an acquired taste while Murray is funny, even if his wit is never called on.  O'Keefe is a lead forced into the shadows by his costars.  Even the gopher stuck in my mind more than O'Keefe and his animal house wannabes.Overall it is remembered fondly for no good reason.  The clever, funny bits are lost in a sea of lazy vulgar humour.  If you remember it as good then don't watch I again  just live with your memories!",Null,4,11,10 August 2002
The Evil Dead," An influential horror movie with some humour, loads of gore and some shocking moments
","Looking for a fun weekend away, Ash, Cheryl, Scotty, Shelley and Linda all head up to a cabin in the woods for drinking and fun aplenty. Having found it in the midst of the woods, they ignore the mysterious things they see and settle in. However, a clock stops and a mysterious trap door opens on its own and the boys go to investigate. Finding an old book and a tape recorder, they discover that something happened here but don't believe claims of the wood being alive. However when strange things start happening they find it is too late to try and leave and that they have awakened demons that will kill them all before dawn.I wonder if this film would have been as famous in the UK if it were not for the outrage that it got involved in with the whole 'video nasties' affair, I guess we'll never know but whatever factors helped it on its way it is undeniable that Evil Dead has been a great influence on many subsequent films. It is easy to look at the things like the tacking shots (done by running with camera on planks), the excessive gore and the 'cabin in the woods' setting and call it obvious and clichéd but that is to forget that some of these things have become the norm since this film, maybe even because of it. This is not to say that the film isn't cheesy, poorly acted and rather low cost but then that is a fair claim because it is all these things but it is actually more impressive when you know the limitations it was made under. The gore and effects may have dated now but they are still very effective  not because they are cutting edge effects but because they are delivered with a real nasty eye and a sense of horror and brutality that really helps the action. I will admit that ED2 is delivered with real comedy but this film is a lot nastier and I defy anyone to be amused by some scenes. Specifically the BBFC's excised 'pencil in wound' scene is hard to watch but is not as genuinely disturbing as the tree rape  this is not a funny scene but one that really delivers the horror of this film.Given that this is a low budget horror then I think it succeeds well because it is gory and, although not that scary (coming from a man who is freaked out by all zombie films) the gore is hard to watch at times and made me flinch. The performances play second fiddle to the director, who marks out the style that he carried with him on his way to becoming the director of blockbusters that he now is; his camera-work is clever and he has a sense for the manic and the brutal. The cast are mostly forgotten and it is only Campbell who has gone on to cult status, but even his performance is not remarkable here (much, much better in ED2) and the rest are just 'kids in a cabin' fodder.Overall this is a good film that is a low budget horror that works thanks to constant gore, clever and energetic direction and a real sense of brutality in the action. It isn't wonderful and many will dismiss it as just one of many 'don't go into the woods' horror movies but that is to forget how early it came in that cliché. People who dislike gore will find little else here and I personally prefer the horror comedy of Evil Dead 2 that is more or less a remake with a bigger budget, less brutality and more laughs but this is still an influential film that should be seen for that reason.",Null,46,66,27 March 2005
8 Mile," Not a great story  but has good moments and a good central performance
","Jimmy Rabbit is a white kid on the poor (black) side of town.  Growing up with this influence he has developed rapping skills but is too intimidated to showcase in the cruel `Shelter' battles.  Split from his girlfriend, Jimmy returns to his Mum's trailer park home and her young boyfriend.  He keeps his job in a pressing shop while working on his rhymes and trying to work out who, out of all the hopes and promises, will be able to help him work his way out of Detroit.After missing preview screenings and not being able to go when friends went, I eventually saw this a few nights ago.  I was maybe better prepared by this point because the hype had been watered down by a few bad or balanced reviews of the film in the media.  This helped me lower my expectations so that I wasn't let down.  The plot is, well, difficult to describe because there isn't really one narrative to speak of, rather it is Rabbit's story. As a result it is a little rambling with things just drifting through the film.  However that it still works is to it's credit.  The film holds the attention and the story still has enough in it to follow it.The telling is what does it the best I think.  The direction is good, with washed out cameras not willing to glamorise anything.  The biggest smart move was the liberal use of hip-hop through the film.  Occasionally we get a beat of a song but it isn't wall to wall music like many rapper's films. Even where a Eminem track is played, Em's voice is limited to a few broken up words  saving his skills for the climax.  Some of the film doesn't work  I got tired of several rap scenes in everyday situations and it didn't grasp me as reality (although in fairness I don't know if this is the norm in some lives).  Also there are a few too many scenes of meaningless violence that didn't come across as normal life for Rabbit but instead felt like the film trying to show Rabbit to be tough and ready for action.It is difficult to write a fair review after seeing the climax  which his why I left it a few days before writing this.  The climax is a series of short battles in the Shelter that are pumping and exciting.  Not to spoil it but some of the rapper's lines are cool  until Em takes his turns and rips the place down.  It was so funny and funky that I wished that he had made some of his own joints that sharp in his recent Benzino disses.  This is where he shines in the role but he also does well generally  maybe not worthy of an Oscar nomination but certainly very good.  He makes his character likeable but not easily, and he avoids being a sympathy figure.Phieffer is not as good and didn't convince me as well as I've seen him do. He can act but here he is not really a good character.  The support cast are all pretty good and are believable and only a few are clear stereotypical groups.  Happily the usual rapper cameos are minimal and not in your face too much.  There may be more but I only spotted Xhibit and Obi Trise and neither of them took anything away by their presence.  Murphy is pretty good  sexy yet trashy  but her character and her sub-plot didn't really have anywhere to go and just became another part of the wandering story. Basinger is OK but she isn't as bad as I expected her to be (or felt she needed to be).  She didn't need to be like his Mum in the songs, but a little less `victim of circumstance' would have helped buy into it.The message is worthy but heavily made and the story part of the film just didn't totally come off for me  instead it was a bit ordinary and not well written.  However the telling makes it worth seeing  the direction is pretty good and the liberal use of music is one of the many good touches, meanwhile Eminem ensures that it is always worth watching  whether doing witty disses in a car park, ripping the opposition in a battle or just being understated in a good role.  Understated!  Now there's a thing I thought I'd never say again about a rapper in a lead role of a film since Pac died!Like him or loathe him, Eminem prevents an average (at best) story being unwatchable by the sheer strength of his presence.  However those who aren't fans of hip-hop or Eminem may wish to avoid this, as there ain't too much else on offer.",Null,45,75,28 January 2003
Shrek 2," The references and some good performances keep it funny but the plot leaves a bit to be desired
","After their fairytale romance, Fiona decides that it is time to return home (to Far, Far Away) to get Shrek to meet her parents. Despite him thinking it is just one big bad idea, Shrek agrees but is proved right when the sight of two ogres is greeted with fear and dislike by the people and the Royals. Thigs get more complicated when the Fairy Godmother gets involved to help push Shrek out and get her son, Prince Charming, into Fiona's heart with the help of the King and some magic. Will true love out?Within seconds of this film starting it was apparent that the film would continue the mould of the first by being full of cultural references and in-jokes  indeed the title sequence contains some none-too-subtle attacks of Disney! However what was less sure was how the story would hold up when compared to the clever fairytale from the first. Sadly the story is the film's main weakness as it is just not as well written as it could have been  it still works well enough to support the film but too often it feels too busy and forced  it is still a love story with an emotionally warm ending but the plot is overly complicated and, dare I say it  convoluted. Like I said, it still worked well enough but too often a few moments pass without a laugh or reference and the plot is exposed as the deadweight that it threatened to be. It still manages to have heart and laughs but it shows the importance of good writing. I'm not sure if they can correct this flaw for parts 3 and 4 (supposedly already green-lit) but they gotta work out something with a better structure.Reference fans will love it of course and there are so many! Let me see: Little Mermaid, Mission Impossible, Spiderman, Zorro, Hawaii Five-O, Spinal Tap, Fabulous Baker Boys, Indiana Jones, Alien, Garfield, Cabaret, Flashdance, From Here to Eternity, Lord of the Rings, ET, Ghostbusters, Blazing Saddles, Wizard of Oz, Rawhide, Annie, Beauty & The Beast, Snow White  and those are just off the top of my head! Many of these are funny, some of them are just amusing but none of them fall flat. My only complaint about the many references is that quantity is not the same as quality and, in a way, some of them are too obvious and just not as clever as one would have wanted.The cast is yet another reason that the film works. Myers delivers a sturdy role  but he must be straining at the bit for more humour and improvisation. Diaz is again a bit flat for my money and she shows her limitations in bits that require more heart. Murphy is great in a role that has given him his best material for years  maybe it is his supporting function but he is free and fun and one of the main attractions. Banderas is great fun  his character is great and he has great lines all the way through. Cleese is OK but has little to work with  but not compared to Andrews, who simply is wasted. Saunders is so-so but could have been better; not all her fault though as her character is part of the plot problems. Everett doesn't match his Beckham-esque character but he is still good. The original fairytale characters are all funny but some 'local' talent would have been better kept with the US voices in place.Overall this is an enjoyable film but the plot is not as good as the original film. The weaknesses in narrative are partly covered by the increase in references but not all of them are as funny as they really should be. Still a very enjoyable film for kids and adults but they really need to put in more work on the plot rather than the 'knowing jokes' if they want to stop Shrek 3 becoming a series slide.",Null,10,25,19 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Very effective style but Volume II better bring something in the way of substance
","Four years after she was savagely beaten and shot in the head on her wedding day by her fellow members of Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, The Bride awakes from her coma, swearing revenge on those who killed her baby and tried to kill her.  She compiles a list and sets out after the first person on her list, Tokyo crime boss O-Ren Ishii.On the wave of to-be-expected hype comes Tarantino's latest film, and what a very mixed bag it is indeed.  The decision to split it into two parts is probably for the best for audiences who may not be able to cope with this for three hours plus, but it may also weaken the film in a way that I can't be sure of until I see Volume II. I enjoyed the film  and let me stress that for I know many seem to treat Tarantino's films as a `you're either for us or agin us' issue  but I have some issues with it.In terms of style, it is faultless. Whether it be the camera gliding over the tops of rooms or using black and white and animation to interesting effect.  In fact the opening of the film is so powerful that I actually jumped in my seat as The Bride's opening line was cut short.  However the emphasis on style has lost sight of any meaningful substance.  I hope that Volume II will bring this to the table and not just do more of the same  if it doesn't then this is a weak film, if it does then it should work as a whole.  I found it ironic that the only part of the film that became emotionally involving was the animated back story of O-Ren Ishii  ironic that the cartoon section should hold more substance than the main film. While I realise that we will discover much more in Volume II I still found it hard to keep with a film that was only interested in giving me visual stimulation.Speaking of visual stimuli  the fight scenes are clever and impressive. The total lack of CGI is refreshing and the wire work looks natural and never goes totally OTT.  My favourite scene is in the blacked out room in the House of Blue Leaves  a scene that lacks the gore but is visually uncluttered and stylish.  The gore does get a bit tiresome and some of it was meant to be shocking but little of it is (unless this is your first movie!).  One thing that bothered me in the cinema was some viewers feeling they had to laugh during the fight  as if Tarantino can only do violence if it is darkly funny in some way?!The list of homage's etc come thick and fast.  At times it works well (Sonny Chiba's comic relief chapter) but at other points it is so heavy and self aware that it is almost a spoof of the genre rather than a part of it.  The opening title cards before the film are quite clever but when Tarantino gives up his own style in favour of aping others then it is a bit much. Likewise the Rza's score is mixed in the same way.  At times his music is perfect  keeping the mood without losing his own style  at others the music is almost a lift from other films and it feels like a spoof.The cast are good despite not having much to work with in terms of characterisation or dialogue.  Thurman is strong and holds the attention, Liu is impressive but her character is at her most interesting when in anime form.  Carradine manages to be larger than life despite us only seeing his hands.  Chiba is a nice comic touch at the start of his scene and Chiaki Kuriyama is cool (despite herself being a walking reference).  Fox, Madsen and Hannah have little to do but will hopefully have more in Volume II.Overall I did quite enjoy the film but I was left a little cold by a mix of lack of substance and total visual onslaught.  It has clever moments and it never let my interest wane but I really would have liked a bit of heart to go along with the vast amount of guts (and limbs) it had.  Will I be there for Volume II?  A fantastic last line from Bill himself ensures that I will be.",Null,6,14,19 October 2003
Saw II," Enjoyably mean but the weak plot and lack of characters means it is a lesser beast than the original
","Having been taunted by twisted killer Jigsaw, Detective Eric Matthews cracks the clue that leads him directly to the hide-out where they capture the man himself. However Jigsaw directs Matthews' attention to a bank of monitors that show a group of people stuck in a locked house  one of whom is Matthews young son. The people in the house are breathing in a deadly nerve gas which will kill them in two hours, but they have the ability to solve puzzles to get out before then. While they try to solve the deadly puzzles, Matthews tries to break Jigsaw to find out where the house is.When Saw was a big success in the cinemas it was only a matter of time before a sequel was produced that tried to repeat the success all over again and duly this does feel like a film that has been produced to cash in. Of course this is not to say that it isn't any good but suffice to say that it doesn't quite match up the energy and tension of the first film. It does still produce the goods as a teenage style horror movie, with moments that made me cringe and look away all doing just enough to keep the film moving. Problem was more with the plot, which was never going to be as cool as the first film mainly because it couldn't be as simple and sharp. Instead we have a baggier and more contrived set up that doesn't work as well. The stuff with Matthews and Jigsaw doesn't really connect that well to the action in the house and, although part of the twist was reasonably clever, it did rather feel like it was more about setting up more sequels than producing a big impacting finish.The cast are mixed but limited by the material. Bell is good but, considering he is the heart of the story, he doesn't get much to do and is not as good a presence as he needed to be within the narrative (although the producers clearly feel the series doesn't need him so who am I to speak?). Wahlberg is cut off from the action and although he shouts well, he cannot develop the character that was needed in order to explain the plot and make the ending. The rest of the cast are so much filler and generally they run, shout, scream and die as required without doing much to make themselves stand out; basically when the most famous face is 'the guy from Speed' then you know you are in trouble.Overall then this is an OK Hollywood horror movie that has a nice mean streak running through it from start to finish. The story is a bit weak and doesn't have the impact of the original, a problem not helped by the lack of good characters. Fans of the original will probably still like it but it is hard to ignore that this is much lesser product than the first film.",Null,5,9,2 April 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," A film of 2 halves - neither very good
","Clooney and Tarantino are brothers on the run from the law.  When they spend the evening in a truckers strip club they find more thrills than they had expected.  This film was trading on several things - the success of Tarantino, Clooney's star power and the hot property of Rodriguez after Desperado.  Unfortunately these are the main things the film has going for it.The first half of the film is quite good and plays like a Tarantino-esque crime thriller, until they reach the club where it turns into a gory vampire b-movie.  The special effects are good but messy but it replaces tension and thrills with gore and makes the second half of the film a messy fight rather than a tension standoff.  The crime section is good because Keitel, Clooney and Lewis are good in their roles - Clooney deserves special mention as he plays a tough cruel killer, well against type and is the epitome of tattooed cool.  Tarantino however can't act, he's a good director and should do more of that rather than turning in performances like this.The film is a messy action movie, it lacks structure, tension or any emotional core - whenever the actors get turned to vampires you don't really care.  It replaces all these with gore and special effects.  It's worth watching to see Clooney playing against type but outside of that there isn't much else here to justify watching.",Null,13,29,17 October 2001
Jerry Maguire," Sentimental and exploitative but it is very effective if you are in the mood for a romcom weepy
","Jerry is a sports agent and a very good sports agent at that. However when he suffers guilt at the nature of his business he proposed that his company take on fewer clients and put more personal care into them and prints up mission statements for all his colleagues. It isn't long before Bob Sugar is telling him that he is fired. Jerry decides to go it along but only manages to get two clients and one employee to come with him, but quickly even his small successes start turning into failure.Famous for its success, its awards and its catchphrases, this film tends to be loved by a lot of people and hated by a lot of people as well. Now the truth is that it is more or less in the middle in terms of quality and it needs you to meet it on its turf because it won't be coming to meet you. I say this because the film rather coldly aims for its target audience and rarely misses a trick for squeezing out emotion from a moment. Few viewers seem to care that Jerry's epiphany doesn't really see him seeking happiness outside of the world of money but just seeking to chase it in a different way. Others ignore the fact that the central romance of the film seems to be built on slogans and weak spots and even more viewers accept the fact that the emotions and characters rarely run deeper than superficiality. Of course the only viewers that will really hate these things are the viewers that hate the film as a whole, because OK, it does all these things but it is ruthlessly effective in how it does them. You may not like the fact that it does it but you have to admit that it is very effective! It is hard to criticise it for what it does because it is so clear what it is aiming for and it really doesn't seem to be aspiring for much more than that. You can see this in the music, which is good but is used to maximum effect whenever it is needed (I love the Springsteen song but it is used with the subtlety of a sledgehammer) but nowhere moreso than the use of Lipnicki as the impossibly cute child who is never anything other than cute comments and toothy smiles. In fairness he goes as deep as Cruise himself does because he doesn't really go beyond the movie idol level. Sure he does some soul-searching of a sort but he rarely risks being anyone other than Tom Cruise. Zellweger is served up with a hard task and she can't manage it. She comes across as so weak and submissive that she makes their love even less convincing than the script already does. Gooding Jr is better than he has been since (although his career has sort of gone into freefall since this high) although his character is very much the sort of role he can easily play and not anything that deep or complex. Mohr, Hunt and King all fill in the edges.Overall then a pretty manipulative and sentimental film that pushes all the buttons it can get in anyway it can. Some viewers will hate it for this while others (the majority it seems) will just accept it for what it is and embrace its easy emotion and cuddly billboard life messages and slogans. Very superficial and manipulative stuff then, but ruthlessly effective in its delivery.",Null,7,14,11 December 2006
Clash of the Titans," Plenty of CGI and noise fills the time left by an absence of anything else
","The original film is a nostalgic mix of mechanical owls, Division One footballer haircuts and lumbering beasts in my head – no more than that. I'm sure if you put me on the spot to comment on it I would have fond things to say but perhaps this is only due to the passage of time. Perhaps the original Clash of the Titans was nothing more than a rather wooden effects movie like this remake is – but yet for some reason the 1981 film is given praise for it and this remake was battered for doing just that. Well, I don't have enough memory to be able to compare and contrast so I will just focus on what I watched last night.It is just what it suggests it will be by producing endless CGI beasts and effects in one serviceable action sequence after another. I only saw it in 2D (3D still not really attracting me) but I have to admit that the size of the creatures and so on was impressive even if only in terms of being to see all that money up there on the screen. Of course this is not the same as saying as the film is particularly good – because it isn't really - it is only 'OK'. Part of the problem is that it is a very hollow movie; everything looks pretty good on the surface of it technically, but there is nothing below this. I'm not suggesting that the film must be some worthy epic with layering and character depth, but to be honest I would have settled for a bit of fun or a bit of actual excitement rather than just lots of things to look at. As it is though the film is all about the effects and nothing else is really forthcoming.You can see this in the cast – not so much their names (because there are some big names in here) but more in their performances. Worthington is a solid actor and good looking guy – that is what he brings to the table and in this film he probably does enough with that. Neeson and Fiennes have nothing to do – Fiennes in particular looks awkward and uneasy with his character and it is clear this film is a 'job' to him rather than a project. Flemyng is OK under all that makeup while Atherton is pretty but pointless. None of this is a surprise though, it is not a film for actors but rather for effects.Clash of the Titans is a shrug of a film. If you are looking for undemanding noise that will not tax you one bit mentally but will provide big creatures and spectacle to stare at then this will do the job. It won't do the job particularly well, but it will do it and then move on – you'll have forgotten it within a week though as generally it doesn't have much special or of interest about it.",Null,8,10,18 November 2010
Jurassic World," Has spectacle but does rather feel like an unnecessary reboot/remake/sequel (whatever it is)
","It is many years since the summer blockbuster season excited me; I don't mean that in a snobby way, it is just I no longer really want to pay out such money to sit in a noisy cinema to watch so-so movies, where really I can pay less in the Fall when they can be rented for much less money and be watched in my own home. This is not to say I still do not go, and on this occasion it was Jurassic Park that caught my fancy. I'm not sure if it is a remake or sequel or reboot, because it has elements of all of those in here – basically delivering the same story as the first film with elements from the second thrown in; theme park, dinosaurs escape, two specific children are our focal point, etc.As such it all goes where you'd expect it to, and, in keeping with the times moving forward, there are now many more dinosaurs across the film. This adds to the spectacle, and for sure the film does have plenty of money on the screen in terms of the effects shots. In terms of story though, it is not so good. In the original, chaos theory was the handy device that kept it all moving forward, whereas here we have things that make even less sense but that we are just meant to go with. Really it doesn't matter the who's and what's of it all, because we know where we are here; it is disappointing though that it doesn't have more genuine tension to it, and that the set pieces are not as strong in that way as you would want. The film is also not helped by their being very clear replacements for many of the character types from the previous films – which really only serves to highlight them for being less interesting and more generic characters. By the end, most of the people were fairly unengaging as villains or heroes or whatever.With this in mind, it is interesting that the female characters get such a rough time of it. The female lead berated for the distance between her and her extended family (I could not tell you precisely the ages of my nieces/nephews without a bit of thought), and kept fairly cold and bland throughout. Many have already mentioned the quite hideous death of another, totally incidental female character – it is so bad that I do not think there was any judgement involved, so I don't think it is sexist, but it is unfortunate that it stands out as such a statement death. Otherwise, the deaths are mostly the standard anonymous type – they will shock children, but after a while they blend together and only shock by how sterile they become (torture sequence aside).As a whole, the film did entertain in a broad way, and it has enough spectacle to it to keep it moving forward. The detail of the narrative is clunky, the characters bland, and generally the set pieces are not as great as you would want, but it is a summer blockbuster and on that level at least, it does provide distracting noise.",Null,4,11,14 July 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Really dumb and lazy film  barely manages to be fun at all
","IMF Agent Ethan Hunt is sent on a seemingly impossible mission to capture a destroy the only existing supply of a deadly disease known as Chimera. However a group of terrorists, led by ex-IMF agent Ambrose also want the disease so that they can us it to infect the world as they have already got the only cure.  Hunt turns to jewel thief Nyah to help him by infiltrating her ex-lover's (Ambrose) group to spy on them.John Woo must have thought of the elements he needed to follow up the solid thrills of the original movie.  Big action scenes? Yes.  Slow-motion? Yes. Plot?  Characters?  Good theme music?  Logic of any kind?  Nope  won't be needing those!  Or at least that's how it felt.  The plot of the first film was clever despite being open to holes  the plot here makes the first one look like a watertight piece of genius!  The story only really serves to set up action scenes and the like  I can barely remember the disease and can only recall rubbish action scenes!For a director like John Woo I knew to expect slow-mo and OTT action, but I didn't know that it would all be so very superficial and weak.  For example the car chase where Hunt and Nyah meet is just ridiculous and very annoying. The robbery of the disease is a pale shadow of the original film's robbery scene and the final motorbike chase is good but only a hint of what Woo has done before.  The plot overuses the whole `face mask' thing  it must do it about 8 or 9 times  many of those time's there's no way Hunt could have made a mask of the people involved!  It's another example of how silly it is.While Cruise was cool in the first film, here he is slick and tough  an image that doesn't work.  He was much better in the first film.  Scott is non-existent as a villain and is pretty dull.  Newton is sexy but no more than that.  Rhames is good and Hopkins has an enjoyable minor role.Overall this film is an OTT mess.  The plot is a shambles and the action scenes are silly and often have no logical reason behind them!  The overuse of the face masks just points to the total lack of a good script and Woo's slow motion just feels tired and unimaginative.  Only the final action scene is enjoyable, but by then you're ony interesting in turning this off and watching De Palma's much better film instead.",Null,43,64,18 August 2002
The Adjustment Bureau," Yes the romance is nice but the idea is lost and presented with such blandness that it is hard to care
","This film offers an interesting idea regarding an unworldly force that nudges and directs the path all of our lives take, it could have done a lot with it but what it decides to do is make a romantic film within this plot. Now there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself but someone should really have a word with the marketing department who decided that a concept-thriller would be easier to sell, since that is very much the film they set their campaign around – not this one. Anyway, cheap marketing aside, I came to this film on DVD with the trailers a long distance memory and average word of mouth having lowered my expectations somewhat.The film starts with some spark and drive to it as we are introduced to the characters and have the curtains pulled back to reveal what is really going on and the power that 'they' have. At this point I was interested but as the film progressed this was slowly worn out of me. Some will say this is because I am not a romantic; while that may well be true I did actually like the romance between David and Elise, it was well played and the two had that sort of spark that was required to make me believe in them after so little time, so my problem with the film isn't that the central motivator for the events is this potential love between them. No, my problem with the film is with what it does with the idea itself – which is practically nothing.The film has very little pace and generally it drags itself along with the audience always looking over their shoulder to see where the film is – we're already 2 steps ahead and it would be lovely if the film at very least kept up with us. It doesn't though, it plays its spiritual card very early on and it never presents a real danger or threat to be overcome – the men in hats never come off as controlling or a threat or even anything close, at worst they come off as stuffy old kill-joys and in this way they make a poor 'opposition' for our protagonist. I'm not suggesting I needed this to be an action movie, but the lack of any sort of sense of threat or urgency really hurts the film because this 'idea' is the majority of the film, not the romance – so to mess up the basis for your film is not going to go well.It is a credit to the on screen presence and charm of both Damon and Blunt that the romance side of the film works well, they both held my attention and kept me interested even when the rest of the film was so very light and surprisingly bland. Mackie, Slattery and Stamp deserved better – all three of them seemed to be phoning it in without anything really going on in their performances, only the odd flutter of urgency gave them good moments but otherwise they are let down. And they are let down by writer/director Nolfi; this guy has been the writer on a couple of big money-makers but he has done himself no favours with this effort – he loses the idea and gets tied up with the romance, forgetting that the idea is the story, not the romance. He lets his cast down and he lets the audience down – it still all looks expensive and professionally done, but this is for little comfort when the story-telling is so fluffed.The Adjustment Bureau may well be built on a good idea (I will find and read Adjustment Team) but it does very little with it. The romance at the core is engaging but the idea is lost and is handled badly. There is little of interest, threat or pace about it; it isn't a terrible film by any means, it is just so average and lacking in edge that I really found it hard to care – and the fact that I was often ahead of it in regards narrative really didn't help either.",Null,7,12,6 November 2011
World Trade Center," Pretty good despite being flawed in some ways and also getting a head start emotionally as a drama due to the subject matter
","The morning of 11th September 2001 started just like any other for the police officers on duty in the Port Authority. However when a plane flies into one of the World Trade Centre towers, the majority of units are mobilised to respond. Sergeant McLoughlin and a small group of men go into the tower to try and rescue survivors from the floor above. Still at the foot of the towers when the first building collapses, McLoughlin's men are swamped and soon it is only him and rookie Jimeno left alive trapped in a small cavern below the rubble.Hard film to really review and judge this one. On one hand I was clearly moved and engaged by parts of it to the point where I did have to wipe away tears, but on the other hand, witnessing the death of thousands on live television and reliving those thoughts and feelings will hopefully always draw that reaction from me  not just for the deaths on the day but for the world we have lived in and the countless deaths that arguably happened as a result of this day. And that is pretty much how it was with this because I did find it hard to disconnect the wider topic from the story of the two men trapped. Perhaps this was the intension of Stone, to avoid replaying the footage we have all seen but instead make it a human story. If so then he succeeded but in doing so he didn't achieve the (perhaps impossible) task of making me treat this as just the story I was being told.This I found some of the flashbacks to be dull and quite unnecessary, filling in the lives of characters who really I already cared about  not as individuals perhaps but as receptacles holding a lot of other souls within them, while some of the family sequences were perhaps a bit too heavy and long for their own good. The film is at its best when it is depicting the scale of the losses while also highlighting the humanity of the response (well, initial response) from people from everywhere. It is unavoidably sentimental at times but mostly I was impressive by how it generally avoided mawkishness and really pushing buttons. I was worried for other reasons when I learned Stone was making the film  because of his track record of how he approaches subjects  but in the end the film is directly really well, handling the subject sensitively without reducing its impact and working well with the darkness and close-ups of the trapped men.The cast are mostly good and I do think that the same material delivered by lesser actors could easily have seen it plummeting to the level of daytime TV melodrama but you can see the effort the majority put into making this as genuine as they can. Cage gives a good performance and, these days, that should be sufficient praise. OK he is pinned and limited but he does what is asked of him. Peña I liked more as he had more expression and screen to work with. Shannon was effective and tough as Dave Karnes  and the film is kind enough to not explore his instant thoughts of war and revenge for fear it would leave a sour taste now that we are neck deep in Iraq; equally Dorff and Whaley give good 'heroic ordinary guy' late in the film. Being in the families was a tougher job for the cast as this is the side that could have been soapy. Casting Gyllenhaal and Bello seems like the best way of countering that and indeed that is just what they do, making real their characters.Not a perfect film by any means then, because it does drift into soap opera and it does rather feel that we never get into the focused story within the bigger one, no matter how tightly it pulls the narrative around it. Still good and better than it easily could have been, but the real events do help by providing the emotion and shock already built in to the audience.",Null,2,4,6 June 2007
Black Hawk Down," As an intense war movie it really works. But as a true story it is jingoistic and about as selfless and giving as masturbation
","In Somalia, warlord Farah Aideed controls the people and uses hunger as a weapon by stopping UN food supplies reaching his people.  The US military tries to usurp the rule of Aideed but, after 6 weeks, he is still in power and the US demands faster action.  When the military are informed of the location of two of Aideed's top men a mission is put together to catch them. However, when one of the Black Hawk helicopters is hit and crashes, several soldiers are left behind enemy lines, starting a battle for survival and rescue against the hordes of armed Somalis.While most reviews seem to be of one extreme or the other, I think it is important to try and look at the film in the two ways that it should have existed and weight it up on that basis.  First of all, as a war movie there is very little wrong with it.  It is realistic and powerful and you do leave with the feeling of having been in a battle.  The lack of characters is not a major problem as all is required that we know is that these are soldiers - not what family they have or what they are like as people.  However this film would have been much better if it had been totally fictional and had existed just as a flag waving tale to American bravery and dedication to the fight.Sadly this is not a fiction al story, it is based on a true story and it is a lesser film because of what it chooses to omit or spin in it's telling. Like I said, this was a very good film if you want a reasonably intense depiction of being in a battle, however it should have been an anti-war film, such were the lessons to be taken from the events of October 1993. However, because an antiwar film will never sell in post-11/9 America, the film cannot go down that road.  While it is generally regarded that the US attempt to launch an attack in this way was foolish and that the result was a `fiasco' none of that is shown here.  There is no room for comment on the wisdom of the action when there's cheering to be done.  In fact at one point one of the characters even explains the events by just saying `sh*t happens'.This is just one example of how blindly patriotic this film is.  Does this take away from the impact of the film - no. Does it take away from how good a film it is - yes, and it should.  The film never stops shouting about how heroic and upright the US soldiers are and, in fairness, those involved deserve respect.  However the film ignores the fact that a significant number of those involved in the rescue and the fighting were actually Malaysian (who here are limited to serving glasses of water to the returning US soldiers.  Given that the film lacks characters it would have been no problem to replace white US faces with Malaysian ones (they all end up covered in dirt and blood anyway!).  However, to do that would have required the film to suggest that the US needs external help to bail it out - again not an idea that an audience would take.While the film has no characters it is not a major problem, although I would have liked the US soldiers to at least not be all angels!  The cast were mostly good despite not really ever having to act, I was surprised how many well known faces were involved - Bana, Harnett, McGregor, Sizemore, Fincher, Sheppard, Bloom, Piven and Coates to name a few.  However there are no Somali characters to speak of (in fact - no Somalis at all! The extras were from other nations despite not looking anything like the people of that region).  The film early on has Harnett's character express respect and interest in the Somali people, but the film doesn't.  There is no back story about the country and there is nothing to suggest that this country is anything other than armed gangs of angry black people who are killing the good soldiers.  An antiwar film shouldn't really paint one side good and the other bad in a situation like this, and that was the point I understood the film wasn't trying to be antiwar - it was pro-US.It is a shame that the film spares no thought for these people - yes they killed the US soldiers, but the US killed over 1000 of them during the rescue mission.  There's nothing wrong with the film bigging up the US soldiers, but to just totally ignore this fact other than a caption at the end is basic.  The caption may as well have read - `1000 of them died too but they weren't American so f**k them.'  The film's core is the dramatic and violent rescue mission and I can forgive them making it an `all-US' operation given the fact that it is an US film.  However the film made a conscious choice to remove everything about the story that would be critical (which is a lot) of the US, for this reason it suffered a lot - a film that criticises politics and the whole idea of war does not have to do the same for the soldiers.  These men deserve respect no matter how they got there - but the film wrongly carries this respect over to the whole concept and situation. This was a mistake.I have gone on longer about the bad stuff than the good, so let me make it clear: this is a very good film if you are looking for a war film that is dramatic and very realistic.  Scott is a good director and he does very well to make the audience feel like they are in the midst of a battle.  I didn't want it to push an antiwar agenda but I didn't expect it to be as flagwavingly naive as this!  Of course it did well - the audience wanted a film that supports the military, it's just a shame that they didn't just make up a story rather than taking a real one and doing it so badly. There are other people in the world and they are still people regardless of race or beliefs - that this film fails to take that into account is a major failing no matter how exciting or realistic it is.",Null,47,89,18 January 2004
Rudy," Too sentimental but a good look at the American Dream
","Every since he was a boy, Rudy Ruettiger has dreamed that he would play football for Notre Dame college.  However his grades are low in high school and he misses out  ending up at his dad's steel mill.  When his closest friend is killed on the job, Rudy sets out to follow his dream and enlists at Holy Cross college to get his grades and takes on jobs within Notre Dame to make his dream come true.I taped this as I thought it would be the traditional sports movie where the underdog comes through to win the big game at the key moment.  Happily this film aspires to be more than that and is very obvious that it has no desire to be a football film, in fact the game isn't really shown until the final few moments of the film.  Of more interest is the look at Rudy's dream and how it is very difficult to reach, he has to work very hard to get his dream, it isn't something that he is entitled too or has dropped in his lap  it is an American Dream build on work and persistence.  The story is inspiring but is also mixed in reality  Rudy's dream amounts to one tackle and 8 seconds of game time.  This took away a little from his story, but also it made it a better ending  his appearance is in a game already won with only seconds left, but it's HIS dream.The film is way too sentimental and mawkish at times, but it's strong theme still makes it work and be enjoyable.  The cast do a good job on the whole but it is Astin's movie and he does a great job in the lead, maybe only being a bit too nice at times.  Favreau is OK in a small role, as is Beatty but Taylor has almost nothing to do and barely shows her face.  Dutton is good as always.  However the film does rest of Astin's abilities and he does it well.Overall this is a good sports movie except it isn't really a sports movie. Despite it being sentimental and slightly predictable it is still a good story of chasing a dream and fair comment on the fact that the `American Dream' is not just something that happens, it is something to be worked on and chased, and even then  not everyone's dream will result in them being rich etc, but, it says, in America, if you work hard and persevere, then anything is possible.",Null,10,12,3 November 2003
Prisoners," Dark and morally murky even if it doesn't have the courage of its convictions
","In the space of a few days both the male stars of this film were so heavily into promoting it that they both appeared on the Daily Show on different nights. This suggested that the film must be struggling either because of quality or because it is a hard sell – and it certainly seemed that the latter was most likely to be the reason for the sales push. The plot sees two young girls go missing on thanksgiving in a small rural town; a suspect is found and while the police try to figure it all out, the emotional impact on the two families starts to take its toll.This is a hard sell, even before we get to the meat of the story everything has a downbeat tone – even Thanksgiving seems a subdued affair with the grey skies and rain. From here it gets darker as the children go missing, the investigation starts and morality is testing in the actions of the characters. On this level it mostly works pretty well – mostly. The realistic tone to everything draws you into the story and it keeps you there as things start to get murky both in terms of the investigation but also the actions of the characters. This offered a much more interesting film than just a straight police procedural and for a lot of the time it does have real impact to it, but gradually it shies away from it – having its cake and eating it at the same time. This leaves the mystery which is also not as satisfyingly as I would have liked; it was solid enough but with the cast and the dark, adult tone to the film, I was hoping that the narrative would be brave enough to match it in many ways. It did a decent job, but it really did feel like it walked it back too much in too many ways. In terms of length it does run long and would have been better if the mystery hadn't included so many different branches within it.The cast justify the tone and everyone is excellent – to the point where I wished the material hadn't seemed to lose it in the final third. Whether this is a shot at Oscars I don't know but everyone is as strong as the castlist would suggest. Gyllenhaal has a straightforward character but makes a good presence from it; he has an intensity and presence that works for him and the film. Jackman does a great job with a changeable character – bravely ploughing into his actions with determination and as a result it is a shame for his performance that the film doesn't hold together as well as it should for the final third. Support is generally very strong as you would expect from Bello, Howard, Davis, Leo, Dano and others.Overall Prisoners is an engagingly dark and murky crime thriller. The mystery is flawed but still good, while the morality questions are well presented if not fully followed through. A shame for the strong performances that the film doesn't totally hold it together and deliver, but it is still worth watching for what it does well.",Null,4,8,17 November 2013
For Love of the Game," Clichéd and overly-sentimental but works much better in the afternoon daytime TV slot than it did in the cinema
","At age 40 Billy Chapel has a strong baseball career behind him as a Detroit Tiger and he still believes he can continue for a few more years of playing, even though he is not at his best and his shoulder is aching. On the day before the last game of the season Chapel learns that his one-time lover Jane Aubrey is leaving to go to London and the owner of the Tigers has sold them to a consortium that seek to trade Chapel to another team. Retirement seems the best option for him but he does love the game and doesn't feel ready to give it up just yet. These things weigh on his mind as he pitches against the Yankees and he thinks back over the career and life he has had up till this point.Short of adding another hour to the running time, you really couldn't lay the clichés any thicker on this film  even the opening credits are the formulaic mix of home movies and sentimental memories. If you can accept that, then you still have another obstacle to get passed  sentimentality. The whole two hours plus are spent wallowing in sentimentality in regards the present game, memories of baseball, memories of relationships and any other way it can wallow. For the majority it is very cloying but at times it shows what it could have done if it had managed to avoid these problem; occasionally the baseball game is enjoyable, occasionally the characters are realistic and their relationship interesting and engaging, occasionally the film isn't plodding. Occasionally. Sadly for the rest of it, the film does very little.The plot jumps between Billy's memories, meaning that they exist as fragmented parts of a story  making them feel even more clichéd than they already were and preventing us seeing the characters develop over the time. This still could have almost worked if the film had avoided painting the whole thing with sentimentality but it doesn't; instead it runs deep through the film be it via the music used, the dialogue, the little speeches on the mound, lots of little things. Sadly it doesn't and it turns this Hollywood sports movie into the type of sentimental melodrama that clutters up the daytime TV schedules  in fact this film had its UK television premier on a Saturday lunchtime. It is a classy daytime melodrama but it is a soapy melodrama nevertheless. Seeing that the director was Sam Rami, I was a bit surprised but then I suppose that this genre is hardly his forte.The cast can barely rise above the material although Costner comes the closest, hardly surprising since he has done this sort of role several times before. He is grizzled, does a far-off stare when he has to remember things and does look at home on the mound. He still can't do much in the face of so much sentimentality and he cannot carry the clunky lines he has to say, but he is good if you like him (although many people seem to dislike him). Preston is pretty poor and I think it is because her character is supposed to be a 'normal' person and she can't do that. Reilly, Cox and Simmons make the support feel classy but none of them actually have anything to do. The cast might also have some real players, commentators etc but, like the vast majority of the world, I don't know any baseball celebrities and have no real interest.Overall this is a daytime television melodrama dressed up in expensive Hollywood clothes. Although it is quite enjoyable on this level, the plot is overflowing with clichés and the film is scripted, directed, scored and acted with sentimentality flowing from every pore. The end result is an average sports film that will be enjoyed by those seeking a cheesy melodrama but not many others.",Null,0,2,6 June 2005
Logan," Succeeds because it makes you care, and gives the viewer grit and consequences
","This film has had a lot of praise, and I think most of it is deserved. However there is an element where comic book movies generally are not consistently interesting or engaging enough, so whenever one comes along that offers a bit more then we go for it; certainly I know I have enjoyed some of them more than they probably warranted on this basis. With Logan it is that there are consistent touches of maturity, character, and plotting which make it something that I actually cared about. There was scope for much more of this, and it was a shame the characters did not have more quiet moments in between the violence, but there were enough to make us feel for the characters and their relationships.I am not sure that the father/daughter side of things plays out as impacting as it could have, but certainly the relationship between Logan and Xavier is rewarding in its moments. These elements add to a feeling of grit, hopelessness, and grind, which the characters fit and the film embraces. I particularly enjoyed the consequences, the action had heft and impact and major characters suffer and die as it goes ahead. I will borrow a line from another commenter and say that the action scenes are justified or 'earned' by this base, because they don't just feel like mindless spectacle (even if they are very well done).While Logan is not as good as the high praise suggests, it does offer a lot of darkness, character, violence, engagement, and entertainment – very much worth seeing and it does stand above what the majority of this genre is doing.",Null,4,8,30 July 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Has energy to distract, but little substance to engage
","I am as much to blame as anyone for the rash of superhero films doing the rounds, since I do generally enjoy them as very expensive productions, with high energy, humor, and action. Essentially they are easy to watch and generally entertaining. Looking ahead to future years, more of the standalone films will continue to get sequels, while generally also they all start to overlap and involve each other – in particular in the two-part Infinity Wars coming in about 3 years. On the basis of Age of Ultron though, this is perhaps not too much to get excited about, because the film is not a great deal to get excited about.In terms of action, it looks great and has lots of movement and special effects to distract and entertain; but this is probably not enough for a film running over two hours long. The plot also holds out a lot with its additional characters and relationships, as well as morality questions about Stark and the Avengers themselves. If any of this was meant to play out to be something interesting, it really doesn't have the space or time to do so, and essentially the new characters are fairly one-dimensional, while the established characters generally get by on the fact that most viewers will have had a whole film or two to get to know them already. As it is the plot doesn't really hold out much of interest, and the very busy film and action sequences do not allow much room for the film to really relax. There are some good lines in here, dramatic and comedic, but mostly the film feels too full to be able to handle doing what it wants.Those who appreciate the bigger picture of the Marvel Universe probably love all the connections and in-jokes, and small mentions/sightings of familiar characters; however for the casual viewer it doesn't work as well. It remains too expensively big to be a 'bad' film, and I found the energy and action and noise to be a distracting way to pass an evening without having to tax my brain too much, but it is to the detriment of the film that all that energy does not have the substance to really match it.",Null,7,15,26 September 2015
Big Fish," Very sweet, imaginative story despite lacking a strong conclusion
","Will Bloom feels like he doesn't really know his father - his habit of telling exaggerated and untrue stories instead of the truth.  They don't speak for several years until Will hears that Ed is on his deathbed and returns home.  He hopes to find out the truth behind the stories but can only get more of the same without doing some digging.Even having watched the trailer I was unsure exactly what this film was about, but I trusted that Burton's imagination would carry it.  Having seen it, the film can best be described as being about story telling in that the film is more about the wonder of the stories told than the actual narrative in terms of start/middle/end.  In terms of the traditional idea of narrative, the film is not perfect - it is not as meaningful or as satisfying as I would have hoped, and this is shown in an ending that, although sweet, is not as neat as I would have hoped.  However the telling - that's where it is at.The stories told are wonderfully whimsical and amusing, like the film states the stories have elements of truth but also be coloured by Bloom to add life to them.  For me, it was very simple to get involved in the tall tales and I was held in the spell of Ed's stories easily - even thought it never came to a `real' solution I was still captivated by just how sweet and imaginative it all was.  If it sounds like I'm having trouble putting my words together it is because I found the film quite hard to quantify - all I know is that I found the whole experience to be very sweet and enjoyable despite it not really amounting to much in the grand scheme of things.  In this regard the film is a consistently imaginative fantasy film that is gently humorous and outright funny at times.The cast are pretty good.  I was originally a little put off by McGregor's Alabama accent and it took me a minute to get past it, but other that his performance was very good and he helped create the film's mood of wonder and whimsy.  I think both McGregor and Finney needed to have that sort of accent - I don't know why but it is a storyteller's accent and it does help the material.  Finney is good and manages to keep the spirit of McGregor's character going despite not being surrounded by the images to support him. The support cast works well whether they be tall giants or well-known cameos from Buscemi, Carter and Devito.  Lange, Crudup and Cotillard are all good but it is easily McGregor and Finney's film.Overall some will find the lack of structure and real substance to be a problem - after all, this is a film about tall tales and not everyone will be able to enjoy that.  However this is a wonderfully light and fun bit of whimsy that is a lot better than I expected it to be.  While it may not amount to a great deal more than that, it can still be enjoyed for what it is - a great fun story!",Null,81,148,8 February 2004
The Insider," Engaging and impressive across the board despite a few niggles
","Fired from his vice-president research job with a large tobacco firm, Jeffrey Wigand accepts a temporary consultation role for Sixty Minutes producer Lowell Bergman. During this comparatively straightforward role, Wigand catches Bergman's interest by clearly stressing what he can discuss and not discuss. From this casual comment, Bergman starts asking and learns of Wigand's opinion that the CEO of his former employer perjured himself because the firm is very much aware of the addictive effect of their product. When Wigand decides to move forward with Sixty Minutes and act as a whistleblower, pressure is very quickly brought to bear on him, his family and all the companies involved in the story.There appears to be little debate on this site as to whether or not this film is long and slow  it almost certainly is both. However where there is a lack of consensus is over the question of whether this is a problem or not. So we get comments saying how engaging it all is contrasted with those bemoaning it for its length and how boring it all was. I cannot say who is right or wrong, all I can do is add my opinion to theirs and say that to me there was the risk of this being quite hard work and I think it is credit to those involved that it is not. I was surprised by the fact that I still had not gotten round to seeing this film almost a decade after it was made, but in my defence the subject does make it sound like it will be dry as sand and as exciting as ironing. Still, given the stuff I do watch it is a real oversight on my part not to have seen such a high profile film.Watching it for the first time is to be impressed. As someone else has said, most people will know how it ends but yet the film still manages to grip the viewer. The story itself is fascinating not only in regards what happens but also its wider meaning. The script allows the viewer to understand the commercial forces on the tobacco companies but also on the news firms and this helps to make the film more interesting than just the very specific story of Wigand. However the central story itself is still interesting and it does fill the time with a steady (albeit slow) pace throughout. The liberal bias inherent in the telling is a little off-putting as the film seems to be aiming a bit too squarely for corporations and those making the money rather than just letting the audience draw their own conclusions. That aside though it is still a quality piece of work across the board.Mann's direction draws out strong performances and also puts the audience into the action even when, technically, there isn't any. He is greatly helped by cinematographer Spinotti, who delivers corporate blues and greys as well as alternating between a static camera in some scenes and a unsteady handcam that matches the increasing stress and strain being put on Wigand. The lead two are both excellent. Pacino of course chews the scenery but he does so in a way that is comparatively restrained to when he is particularly hammy  here he is just right, a strong presence but not to the point of being detrimental. Crowe is just as impressive but provides a very subtle performance that has the material but lacks the flamboyance of Pacino's performance while being just as good. Support is solid with turns from Hall, Plummer, Gambon, Gershon, Torn, Tobolowsky and Venora and the cast doesn't really have a weak spot.It is long, it has very little in the way of 'action' for those looking for explosions and such and the political slant on the telling is very much to the Left, but yet it is engaging and professionally done. The cast are impressive at best and strong at worst while Mann and Spinotti have produced a film that is beautifully crafted and uses the camera to engage the audience as well as the performances and story. Don't follow my procrastinating example and seek this film out soon.",Null,1,3,10 March 2008
Quiz Show," Polished and professional drama
","The ratings of 1950's quiz show `21' are in freefall due to the dominance of dorky Jew Herbie Stempel.  The sponsors and network owners put pressure o the producers to replace him.  When WASP Charles Van Doren comes to audition for another show they offer to ask him the questions that he already answered at the practice.  Herbie is told to take a dive and Van Doren becomes an audience draw.  However when Herbie starts making noise about a fix, a congress employee, Dick Goodwin, decides to go after the network.This is a glossy, professional piece of work that sadly was never as huge as hit as it deserved to be (probably not enough explosions for the US audience).  The story is based on a true story that happened in the 50's and it's used here partly as a bit of history but also as a look at television in terms of it's most basic desire to sell and entertain at any costs  if that means fixing shows or getting the `right' ethnic groups on screen then s be it.  It is effective on that level because it's hard to imagine anything has changed since 1950.  The actual human drama comes between Van Doren and Stempel  the film makes them both real people, neither good nor bad but having a bit of both.Turturro is the best thing in this film.  His Herbie has so many levels which he must touch throughout and he does them all well  whether it's humour, pride, anger or realisation.  Fiennes is good but at times I did find it hard to be sympathetic with a WASP born into a lofty family who gets more given to him.  That said Fiennes did him well.  Morrow was a strange choice  famous at the time for Northern Exposure, he does a weird performance here  almost doing an impression of what he thinks a tough Noo Yark investigator would be like.  The supporting cast is filled out with quality so deep that even the extras are famous now! (Calista Flockhart turns up briefly).  David Palmer and Hank Azaria are good as 21's producers, Christopher Mcdonald is good as the host  people like Griffin Dunne, Mira Sorvino, Timothy Busefield and Barry Levinson come and go, and Martin Scorsese has a wicked role as the money behind the scandal.It works on many levels  at it's most basic it is a true story of great interest, at best it lets you see how television works and how men with money can rarely be reached for any wrong doing.  Working on so many levels this is a polished professional drama that involves from start to finish.",Null,46,66,15 June 2002
Major League," Clichés galore and no real substance but it is amusing in an undemanding and distracting sort of way
","When her husband dies of a heart attack, former exotic dancer Rachel Phelps inherits the Cleveland Indians  a baseball team that has 'enjoyed' a 34 year slump. She immediately makes her plan clear  to make the team lose so badly that she will be able to move the team to Miami. Her first move is to bring in a whole raft of new players  deadbeats, former stars, no-hopers and such and then bring them under the management of Lou Brown, now working in an auto-repair garage. With all the players in place the team is naturally a mess and start the year as such. But can the misfits pull together as a team to make a hit in the league?With a plot that is pretty much just one long cliché this film was never going to be anything special but it isn't terrible and it does actually manage to be amiable enough to entertain. A couple of times the narrative tries to do something interesting with the characters but it never gets to the point where you could compare it to the much better Bull Durham and really it shouldn't have bothered. Outside from this there isn't really anything that provides consistent laughs but it does manage to have a vaguely humorous air to it for most of the running time. I suppose it depends how demanding you feel when you watch it but if you accept the clichés then you'll probably buy into the relaxed air it has. This isn't to suggest it is any good (because it isn't) but sometimes it is comforting to be somewhere familiar and you can't get much more familiar than the clichés on display here.The cast are quite impressive on paper and their collective charisma is part of the reason that the clichéd material actually is amusing. Berenger plays grizzled better than many an actor and is solid in the clichés despite not being able to do anything of value with his subplot with Rene Russo. Sheen and Snipes are both very young looking and play their roles well enough. Bernsen isn't the most convincing but he does alright (again not able to do anything with his more serious subplot though). Russo is totally wasted but Ross, Haysbert and others in the team are reasonably enjoyable while Whitton delivers her character well.Overall then, hardly the greatest film ever made, or even that good a film but one that just about does enough to be enjoyable if you are in the mood for it. Trading almost totally on clichés the film was never going to be anything special (and it isn't) but the sequels indicate that there must be a market for even stuff this derivative and I suppose that it pretty much delivered all I wanted on a very lazy Sunday evening where I didn't want to think.",Null,0,6,11 December 2005
The Dark Knight," Impressive blockbuster with dark tone, plot, characters and delivery making its satisfyingly 'grown-up'
","Batman has proved successful in cleaning up the streets and a fresh new DA, Harvey Dent, is keen to clean up the mobsters in one big conspiracy case. Naturally an unpopular move, particularly with the psychotic villain known as 'The Joker', who makes it his mission to unveil the identity of the Batman, before killing him. The Joker begins his reign of terror, forcing the citizens of Gotham to wonder whether or not it was worth having a Batman if this is the sort of chaos that his presence unleashes. With the stakes raised higher than ever, Bruce Wayne struggles to hold onto his moral code in the face of villain whose only aim is to unleash chaos and panic across the city.I waited a few weeks for all the hype to die down, but I was looking forward to seeing this film because Batman Begins had done a great job of repairing a character and franchise that was in tatters as Schumacher's gaudy and unlikeable Happy Meal-selling film had finished with it. I was hoping for more of the same as The Dark Knight did not disappoint as the tone continues to be dark and as realistic as a film can be when it is about a man dressed as a bat. The film is a summer blockbuster but yet it manages to at least get close to a really engaging and interesting plot  this is a joyful far cry from The Fantastic Four and the like, this feels like a film that is marketed to me, not my children. As such the plot does offer some good moralising and conflicts that are what I expected from the damaged 'hero' of Batman and the freaks he is up against. Again, it is not a 'proper' drama but these elements are effective within the bigger picture and they only help draw the viewer into the story and characters.The fact that it does engage also means that the action is much more effective. I watched Wanted the other night where everything was so simplistic and dumb that I never cared and the action was only effects. Here the tone is deadly serious and the action feels urgent and dangerous. This has produced the problem in the UK over the rating and I do think that it should have been a 15, although I can understand why it got a 12A. Problem for the certification body is that the film doesn't contain much in the way of graphic acts but it is the tone that is so very harsh and dark, thus making it feel much more violent than it actually is. For me this is not a problem as the film is not for children and I am not a child, but I can sort of see why The Daily Mail jumped on it as the destruction of the mankind or whatever they said it was going to do to our children. I do like the dark tone though and it is not just a visual thing or something in a specific few scenes but rather woven through the whole film. It starts with the characters and performances and of course comes across in the direction and cinematography, which is suitably dark and Gothic without being camp or unrealistic.The cast do good work but all are in the shadow of Ledger  not because it is fashionable to praise him but because his is a great turn and makes the film. I do feel sorry for Jack Nicholson because his Joker now looks like a childishly simple creation that is a bit of cheesy fun but no more. With Ledger we genuinely feel unnerved with him on the screen, his clothes and make-up being all part of this unhinged creation with his ticks and hair-trigger air; his performance is part of the film working as well as it does as he sells the character and the material. If he does get an Oscar nod, it will not (just) be for sympathy, but because he genuinely is that good. Bale finds himself a supporting player in his own film but deals with it well; not sure about his laughably gruff voice as Batman though  it just distracts. Eckhart is a good bit of casting because he normally plays morally dubious characters, so the contrast works at the start and he can work with the later stages. Gyllenhaal has her critics but she is much better than Holmes and stands up well with the all-male cast. The supporting cast offer the usual quality in Oldman, Caine and Freeman as well as other faces in minor roles such as Roberts, a returning Murphy, Carbonell, McFarlane, White, Fichtner, Lister and others.The Dark Knight is a great film. The dark tone, good plotting, strong characters, performances and overall design and delivery all make for a grown-up blockbuster that is heads and shoulders above its peers. Ledger is impressive and drives the film forward in an adult and engaging way. Parents with the legal ability to take their four year olds should think twice, because this is not a kiddie blockbuster, but for everyone else there is a great deal to enjoy here.",Null,10,26,11 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Dark, professional, engaging and enjoyable
","Another year begins for Harry with more challenges than ever. The Ministry seem intent on having him expelled and it is only some timely interventions that save him  but they come at a cost to those involved. Back at Hogwarts proper and changes are afoot with the addition to the teaching staff of Professor Delores Umbridge as the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Umbridge's refusal to actually teach the class sees Harry and his friends secretly practicing themselves but cannot stop her rise to power, displacing Dumbledore. This all occurs while the shadow of Voldemort looms over Harry's life.I've still not bothered to read any of these bl00dy books and I'm rarely that bothered about seeing the newest films but I must confess that the Harry Potter films are often pretty good when I actually do get around to seeing them. It is a surprise then that I'm not more into them in the way that some other series have held my attention but there you go. Anyway, Order of the Phoenix eventually came to me on DVD and I settled down expecting professional big budget entertainment. And this is what it delivers and it is hard to fault it for what it does  again its failure to really grip me across films is not one I can pin on any one thing and certainly not in this film.For my money the series has got stronger as it has gone along and it does feel like it has become more comfortable in itself and its audience but, rather than complacency that this guaranteed box office might produce the films have worked harder. Phoenix is stronger than Goblet of Fire, which itself was better than the one before (the first two films didn't really do a lot for me even if they were 'good'). Opening with a tremendously stylish and gripping extended sequence, the film marks out its darker material from the start. It continues with this pretty well and the happiness and carefree introductions of the first few films are pretty much gone. I imagine that this will not be to the pleasing of parents of young fans but for me the menace and fear is pretty well balanced out, although I'm not a great judge as for me I like the idea that films meant for children would have dark themes and not just be a collection of soft shapes and bright colours where everything is right with the world in every regard.The story provides some strong set pieces and the series has improved yet again in the area of effects. The final fight sequence producing convincing and engaging effect shots as if it was doing it just for fun. Yates' direction is effective and he holds well to the look of the other films but yet brings stuff of his own. He doesn't let it sag often and the film does feel tighter than earlier ones even if at times the 'bigger picture' was lost on me as we seemed to have very specific narrative threads going on. The characters are stronger and parts of the cast step up to this; Radcliffe in particular impressed me with his range and he genuinely (and literally) has grown with the role. The supporting cast is as usual deep in British stars but this was not as distracting to me as before. Fiennes is a great force in the background and his limit time is well used. Oldman, Rickman, Smith, Issacs, Thompson, Carter and others all provide quality even in small roles. Staunton is a nice addition and does well in what she has to do even if I felt the film gave too much time to her here and there. The young cast are good in some areas (eg Watson, Grint) but the non-speaking roles are annoyingly overdone with their facial expressions and they bugged me hanging around the edges of action ('ok kids, act INVOLVED!').Overall though this is a very engaging and enjoyable film that seemed to effortlessly fill the time. Something about the series is still failing to hold me to the long game and I think it is the development of really strong characters but this is getting better as it gets darker. Regardless though the film is very professional with strong effects, starry cast and a consistently engaging plot. More importantly it is better yet again than the film before and is a credit to the series at a time when most film series tend to fade rather than grow.",Null,1,4,12 April 2008
Annie Hall," Woody Allen begins to grow up one of his best
","A young comedian (Alvy Singer) has just lost his girlfriend, Annie and can't work out what happened.  He goes back through his past in one long flashback to try and work out why and where it all went wrong.Woody Allen's career started out making films that were slapstick mixed with surreal humour.  He later moved to making more witty films that sought greater characterisation.  The missing link in this was Annie Hall - a film that effortlessly mixes the two.  The story is essentially a romance, but it spans back to Singers' childhood to weave a background for him.The way Allen links all the flashbacks is very clever - most have a link in terms of dialogue etc so that the narrative isn't so iffy.  The various tricks he uses are very imaginative as well - people's thoughts are shown in subtitles, Singer gets solves a cinema queue fight in a very novel way and at one point, to demonstrate how he makes the wrong choices in love, the film turns to a Snow White cartoon.Allen is great in the character he has played so many times.  His writing is excellent - clever mix of wit and surreal humour and his direction is faultless.  Keaton is excellent and very familiar with working with Allen. The support cast is excellent and is full of cameos (from famous faces and faces that later became famous) including Paul Simon, Shelley Duval, Christopher Walken, Sigourney Weaver, Beverly D'Angelo and Jeff Goldblum (`I've forgotten my mantra').Allen's best ever mix of his standup humour and his more adult character pieces.",Null,5,8,30 January 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," Slightly sentimental towards the end but well controlled and involving
","After an apparent suicide attempt, Susanna meets with a physiatrist friend of the family who tells her she should go to the local mental institution. She signs herself in but soon after realises the enormity of what she has done  however she cannot leave until they let her go.  An outsider at first she soon befriends the aggressive Lisa and tries to come to terms with the institute around her.Despite being an Oscar winner I felt no great compulsion to check this film out at the time of it's release  I'm not sure why, perhaps I was put off by the (unfair) claim of it being a `female Cuckoo's Nest'.  However by and large it was my loss as much of this film is good.  The plot's central message that these people are just `normal' people exaggerated is OK and not too sentimentally delivered.  The film is not quite as moving as I felt it should be though  it went just where you expected it to and feel into too many clichéd moments and moments that do touch on the syrupy.  However it is interesting enough to overcome these obstacles and makes for a good watch.The cast is the main reason for watching.  Ryder is a little too wide eyed for my liking but still does a very good job (and her opening lines about stealing are very funny in retrospect!).  However the real scene-stealer is Jolie who brings a realistic energy to the film.  When she is off screen you really feel her loss as the film does dip a little into sentiment. Goldberg's character is the weak link as much of the sentimentality comes from her direction, she walks around with her assured smug air and you just know she's going to bond and hug with somebody.  Murphy, DuVall and Moss all do well in support (although I found Moss a little too sing-songy). Redgrave, Tamborand and Leto give small roles but good support as well.Overall this is not as good a film as Cuckoo's Nest but I think the comparisons are perhaps a little simplistic and unfair.  As it is this is a good film that only loses it a little at the end where it tips into a bit of preaching and sentimentality.  I think it bothered me more than it should because I know Mangold can control this aspect well as he did excellently in Heavy.  But these are minor complaints and it is involving and has a two strong performances in the lead.",Null,0,2,5 May 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Painfully slow at times, fascinating and exciting at others  an intelligent sci-fi that looks great and is engaging despite having some weak aspects
","A group of apes feed together as a tribe, fending off other apes. The discovery of a tall black monolith, the use of a weapon and the sending of a signal see us jump into the future where a mission is being sent to the moon. The mission is in response to the discovery of an unnatural monolith that had been deliberately buried under the surface. When the monolith emits a high pitch signal we jump 18 months forward to a mission on its way to Jupiter. Drs Bowman and Poole lead, with the rest of the crew in hibernation and the ship under the control of a HAL-9000 series computer. Things are strange enough with the mysterious nature of the mission but an apparent error in HAL creates more immediate worries.If you will humour me for a moment I will state my interpretation of the plot before looking at the film. To me the set up is about evolution of man, here being either guided or monitored by an alien race for reasons we can only wonder about. Obviously the monoliths mark times where we have advanced to a point where we can go to the next step, with Bowman's eventual journey just being the next step in man's evolution. Now what HAL's malfunction has to do with this is beyond me, in fact I'd say that it is actually unrelated but is just a separate part of the same story. However this is not a problem because both parts of the story are full of interesting ideas and strands that more than fill what is, lets be honest, a rather slow and unnecessarily long film. The pace may infuriate modern, younger viewers who have come to this as 'one of the greatest sci-fi's ever made' expecting it to be an Aliens or a Star Wars  it isn't, it is cold, remote, slow and built on ideas more than action.The film does have several sections that could have been significantly trimmed or lost altogether and it is hard to see why some of them were there other than to fill out the running time (the bit about the rumour of 'infection' on the moon could have been lost as we are told this much briefer in the meeting in the next scene; and the apes could have been shorter) and this is always a problem to me while those scenes are on. However, as an overall film it isn't a problem because the time does move surprisingly quickly considering how little happens at times  and it does this because it is relentlessly interesting. The evolution thread is never fully answered and, for that reason, is interesting throughout even if some viewers will baulk at the idea of being left to make their own conclusions and not having it all neatly explained for them. This makes up the beginning and end of the film, but the middle 80 minutes have little to do with it and instead are more about a view of the dangers inherent in a cold future where computers are given too much trust, credit and responsibility. Looking back, this view has only become more and more relevant and is now such a part of sci-fi that it is so easy to forget how influential this film has been. It is never fully explained why HAL goes (to quote the President in Strangelove) 'a little funny' but it works the better for us not knowing  it feeds our mistrust of him as a computer because it could have been deliberate, accidental, pre-programmed or just his application of pure, cold logic to an situation that, because it involves humans, can never be seen in those terms. I won't ramble on, but it provides so much food for thought that it more than makes up for the very cold, stretched plot and running time.Although it is easy to pick holes in it from our CGI-enhanced world, the film still looks great and, more than that is actually imaginative  something that CGI sometimes fails to be. Again there are probably too many long scenes of craft moving silently through space but generally they are interesting. The first cut form bone to ship to the Blue Danube is iconic and will be known even to those who have never seen the film; meanwhile the silence of space is well used. The Stargate scene is well known as a 'trippy' scene but even straight it works and (despite being overlong and slightly dated) is imaginative and interesting. The cold mood continues with the direction as Kubrick uses a lot of very static shots to tell his story  without the style and interest brought out by the movement it is WHAT he looks at rather than how and he manages to frame all manner of interesting shots within the ideas in the script. Performances are very much secondary in this cold film but Dullea is suitably restrained even if part of me wanted him to be more human in the face of HAL. Douglas Rain only provides a voice but comes out as the single most memorable 'actor' in the film as he plays HAL with cold, logical and unmeaning menace. Outside of these two nobody else really shines as they are never the focus, although it always amuses me to see Rossiter in there! Overall this is deservedly regarded as a classic and 'must see' film. It is not a perfect film as it is overlong, is not edited as tightly as it could have been and does sometimes focus on visuals while leaving us to work out the substance ourselves, but these are minor complaints as the film is filled with imagination both visually and idea-wise. Its status and reputation mean it is a 'must see' for cinema fans, it is just as well then, that it is a brilliant and intelligent 'must see' to boot.",Null,16,33,3 January 2005
Toy Story," Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit
","Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",Null,107,113,22 April 2003
Blood Diamond," Strong film despite the problems with merging a real horror with a traditional Hollywood narrative
","Separated from his family by rebels, fisherman Solomon is forced to work in the bloody diamond mines, locating diamonds that the rebels use to fund their war against the government. Danny Archer is a former mercenary who now smuggles diamonds out of the conflict zone into neighbouring Liberia so that they can be documented as legal. Maddy Bowen is a journalist, in the area to make a difference by exposing such illegal activity and the suffering it produces. When Solomon finds and hides a large diamond, Danny and Maddy both get involved in his life and on a journey into the horror of the illegal diamond trade.I wasn't sure how to approach this film because it is so clearly a 'message' film on a topical issue and Hollywood doesn't always have the best track record on this. However on the other hand it has been voted very highly on IMDb (one of the best 250 films ever made apparently) and generally well received by critics. Watching it you can see the duality at work within the production because on one hand it is trying to make sure we understand just how much suffering and death is associated with and supported by this trade but then it also needs to deliver a film to entertain the masses in order to get this message through. The meshing of these two aims is not always very successful but generally the approach works to a point. At some points it is quite shocking to see the casual treatment of life, the creation of child soldiers etc but then at other times it is more of an action movie, with Danny dodging bullets while women and children are hit. The story requires a plot and this doesn't really explore the reality of the trade so much as use it as a backdrop for a simple story where good prevails. Again I know this is a necessary part of getting the message to a mass audience, but it is hard to see where 'good' is in this story.So really I found myself wanting a much harder ride from the film  I genuinely wanted to feel angry and shocked by it but the approach maybe minimised that for me. This aside, the film is actually pretty good and it works well as a dramatic narrative within the setting of the diamond trade.Zwick can do 'epic' and indeed this is just what he does. OK, perhaps he is also responsible for some of the reality and horror being sucked out of it in the meantime, but you cannot really have an issue with his direction when it comes to the sweep of the film and specifically some of the bigger action shots. His cast are roundly good as well. DiCaprio does well with the accent, even if it takes a second or two to get used to. I liked that he never seemed to be undergoing a significant 'realisation' as the film went on  he was better than that and he knew his character. Hounsou is better and does dominate the film thanks mainly to the 'better' material handed to him; he is convincing and drew me into his character. Connelly doesn't do anything wrong but is only so-so, again due to her character's place in the script. Support from Sheen, Vosloo, and others is roundly solid.Overall then a strong film despite the problems with merging a real horror with a traditional Hollywood narrative.",Null,6,8,1 October 2007
Men in Black," Fun but totally unmemorable
","When NYPD cop Edwards pursues a subject that he believes was some form of alien he finds a mysterious agent believes him and offers him an interview. When Agent K offers him a position as a man in black he discovers an underworld of aliens that is regulated and hidden.  When a bug comes to earth in search of the universe agents K and J find themselves in a race against time to stop the bug and prevent the destruction of the earth.This film was well hyped when it first came out and got plenty of good publicity through Smith's song of the same name.  However it always felt like a film that was gearing itself up for a sequel rather than a film in itself.  The story is in two strands - the first is J's fish out of water act and the second is the search for the universe.  These two interlink as the main body is the attempt to stop the bug, but the funniest moments involve J being overwhelmed by the tings around him - in this setting he is the most accessible character to the audience as we are experiencing the same as him.  The plot is a little daft but it's all delivered with tongue in cheek and has enough laughs to keep us amused.Smith delivers yet another popcorn blockbuster and does his usual cocky performance that we've seen so many times - the only thing that stops him getting irritating is that he is clearly out of his depth in K's world. Tommy Lee Jones is very good and in my mind, a lot cooler than Smith, he does get some good deadpan lines but mainly is Smith's straight man.  It's hard to imagine anyone else doing the role as he does it so well and I hope they manage to twist the sequel to bring his character back in - I can't image Smith can carry MIB2.  Fiorentino, D'Onofrio, Shalhoub and Rip Torn all add class in support but this is mainly Smith and Jones's show.The special effects are good and the action is cool in a comic book style. However the length of the film and the focus on K and J's interaction rather than a straight up plot does make it feel like it was made with an eye on a franchise rather than the film as a complete package itself.Overall a funny stylish comedy that will amuse throughout.",Null,12,20,11 January 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman gets the emotion right this time, the direction is great and Carrey is suitably low key (review contains thematic spoilers)
","After being blanked by her when trying to make up, Joel discovers that his girlfriend (ex) has had all memory of their relationship wiped from her memory using a process carried out by Dr Mierwiak. Distraught by this, Joel decides to undergo the same treatment. Mierwiak's operators (Frank and Patrick) come to Joel's home to carry out the process but, as his memories are wiped, Joel realises that he has happy memories, albeit they are tinged with pain now. He tries to escape with his memories of Clementine and hid her in his deeper memories. Meanwhile Patrick has stolen Joel's memories and is using them to try and seduce Clementine.If one thing surprised me about this film it was just how successful it seems to have been. I say this because the audience that makes a hit is mostly a young one. This film requires a maturity or experience in relationships that many younger people will be fortunate not to have. The film relies on you having had a break up where one partner moves on without delay, leaving you in their wash  just as Joel had here. Sadly I have had such an experience, and the idea of washing away painful memories but also wanting to keep them for their happiness is one I could relate to. Perhaps this is why, for my money, this is the most emotionally involving script that Kaufman has done yet. Normally he is very quirky but that's it, here he shows a real solid bit of emotional that really helps what is actually quite a weak plot.The story follows a thread within Joel's mind as well as a thread involving Patrick and Frank. Both these threads combine to make the film's final point but as pieces of narrative they are rather thin. However what keeps them going is both the emotional core of the film and the innovative writing and direction. The emotional involvement comes from the very real picture of Joel  hurt to his core by his ex but slowly realising that her memory is worth having. This thread works much better than the 'real world' one, and it's purpose is not fully clear until the end (although it is still interesting and enjoyable). Only the film's conclusion put me off a little bit  it sort of concludes that our faults will come out and that we will really hurt those we are with, at the end Clementine accepts this with Joel.I agree with this but it is a Hollywood ending that people would do this  in my experience people do not fight through faults, they bare them for as long as they can until they decide to give up. Like I said, Hollywood happy ending. This isn't a bad ending because I was emotionally involved with the characters and was happy with the ending, if not the idea that it promoted.The writing is very clever and inventive (although how many times can Kaufman write scripts around the same theme?) but it is the direction that impressed me even more. The way that the script is brought to the screen and that a world of memories within the mind is displayed so well so as never to be confusing or to lose the audience. It looks great and the deletion of memories is delivered with a very effective mix of styles and presentation tools. To me what made this film so enjoyable was this mix of a clever script with a director who has enough vision to deliver what it requires.The cast are also pretty good, with the only problem being that they occasionally play second fiddle to the visuals and ideas around them. Carrey is very good and shows a subtlety that Ace Ventura fans may not believe he could have had. He has quite a few solid roles under his belt now and he is looking like he is cutting a leading man niche for himself. Winslet is also good and prevents her character from being almost totally annoying  why Joel sees anything in her is a mystery to me! She has less character than Carrey is given, she is either hyper in memory or a little annoying in the real world. The support cast have the lesser thread to work with and their characters are lesser as a result. Ruffalo is impressive but not just for this role. I have seen him in several films and he is different in each: an interesting actor that I'll continue to watch. Wood is a bit too dippy and it's 'too soon' since LOTR for me to be able to shake off the idea that he is Frodo! Wilkinson is a good presence and Dunst is OK despite overplaying the 'carefree' section of her character so that the 'with memories' section will be more impacting.Overall I am surprised that this film is so high up the top 100 on imdb already and I personally doubt that it will keep it over time. That said this is still the best script/film to come from Kaufman thus far. On top of the usuals, he has also delivered emotional involvement with the film and it is this that makes it so engaging. The direction is very impressive and does a great job of bringing the script to the screen. These factors combined with a winning (if low key) lead from Carrey make for a film that deserves to be seen by many viewers, regardless of experience or age.",Null,5,11,16 May 2004
Elysium," Effects and spectacle in search of a decent plot, a decent pace and a decent conclusion
","As someone who really enjoyed District 9 with its mix of social commentary and sci-fi, I was quite looking forward to this film but due to the so-so reviews from critics, decided to give it a while and watch it once the dust had settled. I did so recently and have to say that the critics that laid into this film were mostly right to do so because it is a surprisingly weak film across the board. The plot is about the haves (in space) and have-nots (on earth); it is a familiar scenario and of course the have-nots want what they don't have while the haves don't want anyone else to have what they have.Speaking of haves, just to say what the film does have – it has a very big budget, a very big star and plenty of impressive special effects; so if these are the sole qualities that you are looking for then you'll find much to like here as it ticks these boxes. Unfortunately what the film doesn't have is a great deal of substance to back this up. OK there is stuff in here about immigration and artificial borders drawn in a map but it is really poorly handled with nothing smart to say but just big obvious gestures which really bring nothing (and I say this as a liberal myself). With the subtext mostly just a flapping rag hanging off the film, this should still mean that we get a solid sci-fi action movie but unfortunately this also falls flat. The film has terrible pacing, plot twists and turns that really make no sense at all and generally it doesn't engage.The sci-fi action is technically impressive (despite feeling like we saw it before in District 9) but with nothing to really engage the viewer it just starts to feel like noise and spectacle for the sake of it – which it kinda is. Damon seems earnest throughout and is OK but he is not as light-footed with this material and it shows. Indeed the whole film shares his rather plodding feel. Foster is wasted, Copley's is a good presence but seems out of step with the rest of the film, Braga is stunning as ever but doesn't have too much else to work with and so it goes on.It has a lot of things at its resources in terms of star names, special effects and money to spend on both, but unfortunately the plot is leaden, the pacing off, events unconvincing and unengaging and the subtext is really akin to something scribbled on paper with crayons and a smiling sun in the background. It is expensive enough not to be awful, but it certainly isn't much good.",Null,1,3,23 February 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," A wonderful epic that is really only about one man's regret - excellent
","Noodles returns to the New York of his youth in response to an invitation to come and meet.  His return is his first for half his life having fled New York to avoid being killed for ratting out his gangster friends.  His return is mysterious and he doesn't know why he has been summoned.  His return sparks memories of his childhood and adulthood growing up in the area with his friends and eventual business partners.A three and a half hour movie may not be everyone's idea of fun.  On the other hand, many people who see a running time over 180 minutes immediately assume it is an epic that must be `the greatest film ever made'. In this case the time is worth the effort, even if it a little luxurious and overlong.  The plot is too sweeping to go into detail, encompassing 30 years in the main part and a further 30 by way of suggestion.  Basically it comes down to Noodles memories of his life when he was growing up, up till the point we find him now, as an old man with little but those memories.  As a story this is moving and involving.  There are maybe too many lingering shots of Noodles staring into the distance but these don't feel as lazy as they have in other films.Noodles past and the misery of him now is involving enough, but the main thread is Noodle's past, both childhood and adulthood in crime and love. The sheer detail that must be covered is well done.  The film not only includes many major events but also minor things like the scene where the boy is tempted to eat a cream cake!  This mix is very rewarding and makes it feel a lot more detailed than it actually is.  The story is a real feel of several generations of crime and is very involving.The cast make the film and hold the attention during the scenes that are longer than they should be etc.  De Niro convinces as youth and bitter old man and holds the eye easily as both.  Woods is much better than usual even if his character is the same.  McGovern is good considering she has a minor role, but as an `old woman' she looks the same as she was when she was young.  Actors like Williams, Aiello, Forsythe, Hayden etc easily fill out the gangster etc roles without falling into cliché or caricature.  Just as rewarding are the child actors who carry the first hour of the film.  Not only do they actually look like the actors in question, but they also do a very good job.  There are some bum notes but they do mange the innocence of youth with the emotional basis for the rest of the film.The direction is excellent  both gritty streets but with an affectionate slant of Noodles' memories.  The direction is made almost perfect by the use of Ennio Morricone's score.  It is at once haunting but slightly warming and `Debra's theme' has become one of my favourite tunes.  The overall effect is one of a rich tapestry that eventually weaves into a very personal epic of regret and loss.An excellent film that deserves to be recognised as both one of the great crime epics but also a personal and moving film.",Null,11,19,21 September 2002
Taken," If you ignore the 'message' and accept it as a derivative Bourne then it is actually a solid thriller
","Having hardly seen his wife (now ex) and daughter for the last decade or so due to his work, Bryan is now a former special agent who has taken his retirement early in order to move close to where his estranged family now live. Despite his better judgement, he gives consent for his 17 year-old daughter to go to Paris with a friend. However all his 'paranoia' is justified when his daughter calls him during an abduction by some unknown men. Using his contacts, Bryan learns of an Albanian group specialising in kidnapping travelling young women into sex slavery and estimates he has 96 hours maximum before she is drugged beyond redemption and sold into prostitution. Calling on a lifetime of skills, Bryan goes to Paris to track down those responsible and find his daughter.I have not heard or read any reviews for this film when I went to see it but I imagine that many of them will have called this film a cross between Death Wish and the Bourne films because that is what it happens to play like. The Death Wise side of it makes it a little harder to enjoy but the Bourne side makes it worth seeing. The thin plot is where we have the Death Wise material as the nice retired man who loves his daughter turns out to have been correct that the world is a hideous place outside of the US whenever his daughter gets kidnapped. With hours before she is transformed into a junkie and working for her hits, Joe goes to a Paris where it appears that the Louvre is the only building NOT fully of young women trafficked into sex (and we never seen that so I have no proof). Fortunately, rash violence will save the day. OK so politically this is not the most pleasant pieces of work to be watching but, aside from the first twenty minutes of setup (some of which I could have done without) the plot doesn't really matter and it becomes a race against time thriller.This is where it does owe a great debt to Bourne because the filming style, the action, the urgency and the fighting style are all very similar to the formulae used to good effect in that trilogy. The camera never sits still, the editing is fast and the sound-effects produce an audience reaction themselves. Of course it is very much derivative of Bourne and not up to that high standard but it does still make for an engagingly violent thriller. When it stops moving even for a second, it sags and it doesn't seem to know how to link the scenes (so many actions scenes fade to black and then into a slower scene setting up the next sequence) but mostly it keeps the pace high and keeps moving. This does not make it a great film though, and it is quite a cynical affair in some regards however it is hard to fault it when it delivers such solid thrills as its main function.Of some surprise to me was to see how effective Neeson was in the lead. Channelling some of his crazed performance from Darkman, he is a tremendous force ripping through criminals and surprisingly convincing in the action scenes with fluid and natural motions (helped by very good editing as well). The rest of the cast don't matter so much but Janssen, Berkeley and Vallance are all odd finds in smaller roles while Grace does her bit in regards being a thoughtless teenager and then 'in peril'. Morel's direction is effective even if it is easy to imagine that he has lots of Paul Greengrass films at home and had been studying them pretty closely.Taken is not a brilliant film but if you accept it for what it is then it is an effective thriller driven by brutal (but not gory) violence which is justified by the family heart of the plot, much like Death Wish did. It is best to ignore the 'message' within all this and just leave your brain off to enjoy the action which, while not Bourne level, is still effective and enjoyable.",Null,7,12,30 September 2008
This Is Spinal Tap," A hilarious little spoof - wit rather than clumsy stuff
","In 1982 the world's loudest band is about to undertake it's comeback tour of America to coincide with the release of the new album.  The group, Spinal Tap, is accompanied by documentary filmmaker Marti DeBergi on what turns out to be a fateful chapter in the band's colourful history.Despite what anyone else tells you, this is easily one of the most quotable movies made and is just as funny today as it was when it was made, unless you are so out of touch with the world that it affectionately spoofs.  The film is almost a tragedy so well does it chronicle the absurd collapse of the band.  However, regardless of the hows and whats, the comedy is in the characters and the sharp dialogue.  While most of the specific action is really funny, it is best during the backstage arguments and the candid interviews.The dialogue is fantastic from start to finish and is made better by a superb cast delivering absurd lines with a straight face!  McKean, Guest and Shearer are the strongest of the cast have most of the best lines.  The support cast is also crammed with cameos from such people as Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal, Begley Jnr, Macnee, Paul Shaffer, Anjelica Huston and others. Reiner excels as director, writer and documentarian, the film has his hands all over it.Overall this is a great film, so much has been said about it that I won't go on any longer.  While it is not an out and out spoof like Naked Gun, this film is wittier as the comedy comes from the dialogue and the sheer imagination of the writing!",Null,47,61,1 January 2004
The Mummy Returns," 'Adventure is reborn' (feet first!)
","10 years after they stopped Imhotep taking over the world, Rick and Evelyn are married with a son, Alex. Again they accidentally set off a chain of events that awakens Imhotep from his resting place in the British Museum. However a second force has been released in the shape of the Scorpion King and Rick and Evelyn must race to stop both from destroying the world. Meanwhile Evelyn begins to experience flashbacks that reveal that she may have been Princess Netertiri, daughter of Pharaoh Seti.As with every big blockbuster, a sequel is inevitable. It generally doesn't matter whether the first film was good or not, or if the sequel is well thought out or not. It only matters that it guaranteed to make a set percentage of the original's profit and therefore not a risk. The story here feels forced from the very start - first the introduction of the kid makes it feel like they're just trying to keep it interesting by adding characters (if the first film was like Raiders then this is definitely Temple of Doom). Secondly we suddenly discover that Evelyn is the reincarnation of Princess Nefertiri! How come this little gem never came out in the first film? The addition of 'The Scorpion King' is so minor that you wonder why they used his character at all - then you see that the Mummy 3 will be subtitled 'the scorpion king' and you realise that it was just another excuse to spin money (especially when you see that The Rock was put in the role).The fact that the script has stopped trying is a real drain on how much fun you can have. Right from the start (the fight in Rick's house) you see this - all the main characters just 'show up' at the fight at exactly the right time! Even Ardeth Bay and Jonathon show up - despite the fact that Ardeth just came from Egypt! This laziness is apparent all through the film, it relies on big bangs and OTT action scenes to carry the film.Fraser loses another truck load of credibility by doing this - he's good, but it's obvious that he was too blinded by dollars to read the script. Weisz is terrible - even if she gets more of an action role, her character is still daft. Hannah seems to know he's in rubbish and just wants to get through it and get paid. Boath as the young Alex is all cute, cheeky child adventuring - a perfect example of how cute children are the death of films.For me the saddest performance was Lock-Nah (Adewae Akinnuoye-Agbaje) - it was sad because I know what he's capable of. For anyone who's seen HBO's Oz he played the monstrous Simon Adebesi. In Oz Adewale gave a great performance over 3 or 4 series where his character changed significantly, so he can act but he's never going to be a leading man, so I guess he was happy to get in a big film.Overall this is laughable - unlike the first movie, it's impossible to ignore the sheer daftness of the whole thing. If you don't believe that this is merely a money spinning production rather than an attempt to make a good film then check out the special effects on the Scorpion King at the end. They look so terrible (like a Sega mega-drive's effects) because the effects process was rushed through in order to get the film out into the market.",Null,4,10,4 February 2002
Avatar," Technically impressive and important but beyond that there is not a huge amount to talk about
","Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me – particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first 'big' film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.If we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally – it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I'm seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.In 3D it doesn't quite hit the same mark for me. The 'look it's in 3D' shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn't aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great – the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about 'how did they do that shot' while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious – others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I'll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as 'Unobtainium' and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn't ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana's performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is 'so-so', Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichéd that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn't add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these.",Null,24,38,1 March 2010
Toy Story 2," Great plot, great characters and laughs for all ages  not really a bad word to say about it
","In every toy's life there comes a time where damage and fading interest will take its toll. For Woody this comes when a ripped arm sees him left behind on the shelf awaiting repair while Andy goes off to summer camp. When another toy is taken for a yard sale, Woody goes to rescue him only to find himself trapped at the sale and picked up by a collector  who recognises the worth of the rare dolls. The gang set out to rescue Woody but, with his value as a collector's item and his new friends around him, will Woody want to be rescued?Pixar are going to have a flop sooner or later  either they will misfire or the usual mix of material will start to feel stale. However this has not happened yet and it certainly did not happen with this sequel to their great Toy Story. Keeping similar themes the film delivers a plot that is quite moving at points and has plenty of thought for adults to ponder while the kids laugh at Buzz falling over. In fact this mix of adult material and kiddie material is, as ever, the film's appeal as it does cater so well to both extremes of the market.The plot is great too and is well supported by great characters in the main who really draw us into the story  considering how often computer effects can just be 'effects' and nothing more, it is to Pixar's credit that so often you just forget these are effects and see them as characters in their own right. The plot gives them plenty to do but their delivery is also spot on  actors can have off days and get their body language wrong, but here the computer characters can be manipulated just how the director wants them to be  this really helps the delivery of the character as body language and movement is a big part of it. The voice work also really helps and, as before, everyone is spot on whether they be just delivering jokes, playing comic bad guys or dealing with more emotional stuff. Hanks is really good, Allen is much better than his TV work and other films would suggest and the support cast is very good  with great turns from new voices such as Knight, Cusack and Grammer but also the regulars of Shawn, Ratzenberger, Varney and Rickles.The laughs are consistent and great. I'm sure kids love it but for me the adults get the best deal  getting the universal laughs as well as the adult stuff and the loads of movie references. I won't start listing best bits or references but suffice to say that the film gets it right  enough straight laughs and enough general references to make sure the film lasts and is not tied to the period in the way that, say, the Scary Movie films are (by spoofing recent films).Overall this is a very funny, very enjoyable film that has a great plot, great characters and the cast to back them up. The laughs are good for all ages but the adults will get the majority while the kids miss most of the better stuff. I don't like gushing, so I'd like to counter my praise with some critical observations but, to be honest, I don't really have anything bad to really say about it. A great film to see with the kids.",Null,7,11,9 September 2004
Chariots of Fire," Bland patriotism makes for a dull and mostly forgettable film
","Coming from different backgrounds, two men come together to represent Britain in the 1924 Olympics in the track sprint. Harold Abrahams is a Jewish academic, known to be very fast, having become the first to break a long standing University challenge to race around the courtyard in 12 strikes. Eric Liddell is a devout Scottish Christian and rugby star who has been chosen to rise to the top of his field as a way of promoting Christianity. The two men face different obstacles to make it to their goal but both strive towards the Olympics with one thing in target  victory.For years I thought I had seen this film and it was only recently I decided that I had not. I could recall the famous scenes, recognise the music but yet I could not remember much else so I can only assume that I had picked it up from popular culture rather than first hand. However watching it now I must admit that I could easily have watched it and totally forgotten it because it is a totally forgettable film that seems intent on making me proud to be British by reminding me how good it is to be bland. The plot is interesting in theory but the delivery does nothing with it and just stays on the surface of the material with a tale of stiff upper lips and decorum but no character, emotional engagement or excitement. I know that British period films have a reputation for being very folded in on themselves and restrained but the best ones contrast that with what is underneath  Chariots of Fire seems determined to ignore anything occurred between the words in the script.I wonder why it has its reputation as a great film because I see very little outside of a patriotic swell that would make people (far less the award ceremonies) love it so much. Hudson's direction is fine  a bit stiff and obvious but generally good enough to do the job although did he presume the constant use of slow-motion would have us all on the edge of our seats? If so, he was wrong  it gets tired very quickly (although that may be its status in popular culture working against it). The cast do what is asked of them but, because this is not a great deal, they didn't do anything for me despite the number of faces in it. Cross and Charleson are both pretty bland and they easily have scenes stolen from them by small turns from the underperforming likes of Havers, Anderson, Gielgud, Magee and Holm.Overall this is a stiff British film with nothing of interest happening beyond the simplistic piece of patriotism and story telling. The narrative is dull and the characters could easily have been replaced with bricks without losing any depth. The cast try hard to produce a serious British period film but the material gives them nothing to work with whatsoever. Succeeds on the level of looking professional and being very British and I suppose that must be sufficient for some people; unfortunately two hours later I decided that it wasn't enough for me.",Null,7,16,2 April 2006
Victory," Silly rip off but passable to watch
","When Major Karl Von Steiner sees POW's playing football he suggests a friendly match between the guards and a select 11 of the prisoners.  However as word of the match spreads, the German high command seize on it as a chance to publicly show the strength of the Germans to the world, while the escape committee within the POW camp start planning for a major escape to humiliate the Germans on their big day.Well worth seeing simply because of the range of `famous' footballers in the cast and the fact that it is one of a select few films that is based around football.  That is not to mean it is any good  because of course it simply isn't.  The film is a strange mix of POW movie and sports movie.  The POW side of it is full of cliché and rip offs of better films, the music itself sounds like a watered down version of The Great Escape.  The football action itself is saved for the final third.  I think the film would have worked better if it had focused more on training (al la Dirty Dozen) rather than opening up the stuff around Hatch's escape.  As it stands the game is actually quite enjoyable, of course it doesn't really play out like a real football match, but it's very hard to get that in a film.For all those who say that coming back from 4-1 down at halftime is unrealistic and laughable, I say HA!  A few seasons ago I watched Man United win 5-3 over Spurs despite losing 3-0 at halftime.  Even in the past 3 weeks I have seen both Wolves and West Brom come back from a 3-0 halftime loss to win 4-3 against Leicester and West Ham respectively.  Of course the long midfield runs etc are a little unrealistic but the game itself is the more enjoyable aspect of the film.The cast are not that great.  Caine does almost nothing and seems to have just been interested in playing football alongside Pele and Moore (who wouldn't!).  Pele, Moore and the other footballers all do OK and seem happy to play (but have major problems with delivering their lines without sounding a little wooden).  However, Stallone is probably the best of the cast.  For the most part his performance is pretty weak and he is forced to be a strong chin in an escape plot, however he also does well with some comic stuff and seems to enjoy being a footballer!Overall the film is a very strange hybrid, none of which really works very well.  It is best viewed as a bit of fantasy football where the `Brits' beat the Germans at football (and everything else) mainly worth watching because they can't do it in real life!  The sub-par rip offs of other films keep reminding us that this is not as good as it's peers, but it is worth seeing if you are a football fan  even if it's a pretty poor product as a film.",Null,18,31,13 November 2003
Frank," Not an easy, accessible film but one that is engaging in what it does with the comedy and also the ideas of creativity, individualism and mental illness (SPOILERS)
","Not sure if it is a prerequisite of posting here to use the word 'quirky' to describe this film, but if you did a word-cloud of the user comments here then I guess it would appear as one of the bigger words. The plot sees a standard young man – boring office job, playing at writing songs in his bedroom on his computer – who gets caught up in a deliberately outsider band of musicians, the lead singer of which has a history of mental illness and spends every minute of his life wearing an oversized papier-mâché head. Said young man (Jon) joins them for what he assumed would be an one-off gig, but then ends up staying in a remote location to record their album.There are many thoughts I had watching this film, and I am not entirely sure how to structure them into a meaningful order so that I can deliver this user comment in a way that makes sense. Since this had never stopped me before, then I will have a run at it here. There are many things. The first is that I do remember Sidebottom as an odd alt-culture character who existed on the edge of my awareness; I knew his name and what he looked like, but beyond that, not much detail – so I really brought nothing into this film in that regard, and treated it like a work of fiction. The second thing that struck me is the feeling of creative people not always being those who are seen as stars – together, sexy, beautiful people who everyone loves, but rather people who are out there, being creative for themselves rather than others. One person who came to mind is musician Jean Grae – someone who I continue to love, not because her output is always brilliant, but rather because her output is always what she wants it to be – so whether hip-hop, audio-books, or self- help albums, she is doing herself and feeling good about it – she will never be Jay-Z, but I love that she simply doesn't seem to care about this.I thought of her while watching Frank because there is an element of this in the film – particularly where Jon walks away at the end, convinced that this world is not for him and that he really only ever saw popularity as the goal, not being happy with one's self (as shown by his on-screen social media, with follows/likes always displayed). This is the end of the film, and it is an interesting place for it to go since it does begin with a rather comedic focus on Jon, and then the introduction of the oddly comedic Sidebottom. The journey of the film gradually gets darker and less funnier though – which is not an easy sell but one that does work. The focus shifts from Jon's journey to be one that he is outside of, and while it is heavy in oddity and difficulties, it is strangely engaging. It touches on creativity, on mental illness, and on a spirit that Jon (and I) admire but do not share, and in doing all these things it is both flawed but yet effective.The cast are impressive. Of course the headline is Fassbender, who is a huge star but yet spends the vast majority of the film as a 1980/90's UK masked cult figure. His performance is solid until the end, when it is great – producing a strong ending which lifts the film. Same can be said of Gyllenhaal, who is another surprise find in such an odd film. Gleeson is good because he leads when he needs to, but yet also can transition into the different film we are left with. Outside of these three the support is generally good. Abrahamson's direction is of high quality, and the writing produces an effective mix of the odd, comedic, dark, and engaging.Frank is not a film for everyone – at times I was not sure it was a film for me; but it works. It draws you in with a comedic sense of oddity, but left me with much more than I expected – a piece about individuality, creativity, mental illness and dedication. It is not the film I expected and, while not an easy viewing, it s probably a better film for it.",Null,1,2,6 June 2015
The Artist," Charming and warming story told with style and a wit that rises above it being a gimmick
","From a viewer's point of view this time of the year is a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because so many good or worthy films are out in the cinemas because the awards season is just arriving – so it sort of works as the opposite end of the spectrum to the summer season where all the 'special effects' movies gather, December/January is where all the potential award winners clump up. The downside of this is that some of them can be overly worthy button pushers looking for awards in a shameless way but also that genuinely good films can be over-hyped. This unfortunately happened with The Artist – the praise was all at an extreme so of course the backlash is equally extreme as people go expecting the film to be the most perfect thing ever, only to find that it is only a really good little film.And this is what The Artist is – a really good little film that tells a simple story in an effective and charming way, using the device of being a silent film to very good effect. I'm not sure what some of those criticising it expected to see, but I guess it is hard to not be disappointed whenever every poster on every bus and every review in every newspaper seems to be suggesting it is the most brilliant thing ever – which it isn't. I really enjoyed it though and thought it was as clever as it was simple, producing funny bits but also moments that I was surprised they were as touching as they were. The plot sees a Hollywood actor in the silent pictures at the top of his game who falls on hard times when talkies see his fans deserting him – all as a young starlet who he gave a break to rises in popularity thanks to her part in the talkies. It is a simple story but it plays out very well and the lack of dialogue really doesn't hurt the film at all – it just helps create the era for the viewer.It is never hilarious but it is consistently amusing but of more surprise to me was how moving and sensitive it was - the story is simple but yet it engages and charms. The cast are a big part of this because they give performances that match the 'big expression' nature of silent film acting but they also deliver in the smaller moments so that it is not just the words they are saying that they show, but also their feelings and thoughts. Dujardin in particular does so much without a single word and I very much enjoyed how he led the film. Likewise Bejo is very OTT in her expression but manages to make it work while also being charming and natural at the same time. I'm not sure why faces like Goodman, Cromwell, Pyle, McDowell and others were all in here but they were nice finds in supporting roles. As director and writer Hazanavicius has done a great job and he deserves his Oscar nominations for this.Overall The Artist is a lovely little film with a simple story that is told with invention, wit and charm. No matter how many awards it wins it will not cure you of your diseases or change how you approach life – so if you walk in with that expectation because of the hype then you will be disappointed, but come to it for what it is and you will find that it easily charms and entertains you.",Null,3,8,29 January 2012
There's Something About Mary," OK  it's basic, but some of it is very funny
","Despite a disastrous prom date, Ted is still pining for his high school sweetheart Mary 13 years later.  Hearing she is in Miami she hires a private detective to find out more about her to help him get the courage to go and meet her again.  However the detective starts to fall for Mary and uses his information to get close to her.  On discovering this Ted sets out by road to meet Mary himself  assuming he can get there in one piece.I usually like to write a little about the plotting of any film I review and weight it on it's relative merits but can I do that here? The plot is unimportant compared to the importance of OTT and tasteless jokes and routines that the script allows. So in terms of plot - who cares who ends up with Mary or any detail like that, this is all about the comedy. It is pretty funny but it depends on your taste. Suffice to say that fans of Noel Coward, Oscar Wilde or Woody Allen might find this a little below them. This is not the film to check out if you're looking for wit or intelligent humour. Instead this is where you want to go for the most basic of crude jokes and silly physical comedy.However I don't mean to sound snobbish like this sort of thing is just tasteless and rubbish. Instead it is very funny at some key stages. I defy you not to laugh at some of the more outrageous or exaggerated physical routines - the dog or the prom date are two of the best. More than that the film has added lots of touches which just add to the material even if they aren't logical, for example the wandering band or the final scene with the old man on the balcony are two good examples of weird little add-ons that just are funny because they are not within the reality of the film. Of course, taste has left the building and many people may find it too basic or not like laughing as one of the characters on crutches tries to pick something up off the floor or laughing at Mary's mentally slow brother.The cast do well.  Stiller plays well in his usual sort of role (see Meet the Parents etc) and Dillon hams it up to great effect in a role outside of his normal type of stuff.  Diaz is pretty good and it's nice o see her make fun of herself.  Evans is very funny as Norman and his physical comedy skills are put to good effect in some scenes where `you know you SHOULDN'T laugh'  but you do.Overall this is trashy low-brow comedy.  It is in poor taste for the majority of the film and the targets are often easy.  However I defy you not to laugh during the film  it may never be viewed as art but dammit, it's funny for the majority of the time.",Null,5,12,5 December 2002
Invictus," A 'solid' film that condenses the tournament and the importance thereof, but nothing more than that
","I read recently an article that had Eastwood talking about the Oscar 'snub' in regards best film and best director for Invictus. He talked about having been awarded loads so it was just not his time and the article also included Freeman saying his chances of winning off his best actor nomination as being 'slim to none'. At no point during the article did anyone involved say anything like 'you know what, Invictus is a sturdy film and a decent enough way to spend two or so hours but in terms of saying it is the best anything then that's really pushing it and if we're being honest even the best actor nod is a bit of a joke – although if there was an Oscar for best rugby film then yeah, we'd have that in the bag'. Although that would have made for a terrible sound bite, at least it would have been honest because this is perfectly true and the lack of awards should surprise nobody – Invictus simply isn't a film that deserves to be held up for time as the 'best' at anything it tries to do.At this point let me stress that it is not a bad film – not at all. It is a solid attempt to do a sports movie that sums up the rugby world cup while also capturing the cultural significance of that event; and being able to pull off even one of those would have been impressive. As it is, it makes a good fist at both, good enough to be able to make for a study and pretty entertaining film but at the same time it doesn't do either well enough to hit home or to be worthy of really sticking in the memory as a film (which to me is more of an accolade than whatever they happen to give a little statue to this year). On the sports side I thought that the film did a pretty poor job of conveying the excitement and the tension of the tournament. This was perhaps understandable in a two-hour film and the focus was rightly put on the final with New Zealand. However this game was then delivered without a great deal of passion of heart (or at least not much that translated well to the viewer in the way great sports movies do). What it seemed to be doing is using slow-motion and music to hark to the great importance of the game rather than the specific tensions of the moment, and this puts the onus on the other side of the film to deliver.In this regard the same is true – close, but not cigar. The task of summarising a sea-change in a county is not easy one and Invictus makes as good a go at it as one could fairly expect. However this is not the same as saying it gets it, because it doesn't quite get there. The script really has to boil stuff down to the essentials to make it fit into a film and in doing this it really has to simplify things to the point where there is lots of explanatory dialogue, which is forgivable about the matches perhaps but it does get a bit much to have the political challenges in South Africa treated this way. These two short-comings (for this is what they are rather than failings) both combine to produce a film that is 'OK' and is about as good as it is fair to expect given the subject matter and the approach.In terms of DVD sales, the film now has its 'nominated for Oscar' heading for the cover although I half agree with Freeman in his summation of winning – I agree they are none. His nomination is for his character more than him because his performance is weak. His accent is OK at times and awful at others and his attempts to get Mandela via body language and the famous smile doesn't come off because both feel a little forced, like a man doing an impression. Funnily enough this is good enough for the material but it is only an 'OK' performance. Damon is better in terms of accent and performance although he has the same material and there is only so much there for him. The cast beyond these two are solid and nobody is 'bad' by any means. Eastwood directs in a solid and professional manner but, like the material, it is perhaps all too obvious and predictable. The only really bad aspect of the film I thought was the selection of soundtrack – the songs used are regularly either 'stock African music' or some awful ballads designed to try and wring emotion out of the viewer when the film itself is not – I thought the music was terrible throughout and had the opposite effect of what it was aiming for.I sound very negative but I did actually like Invictus – but note the choice of word in 'like'. It is good enough to 'like' and it is good enough to quite enjoy while it is on. It falls short in all it tries to do and while it sort of does a sports movie and captures the importance of the sport it doesn't do it that well and it really fails to translate this to the audience. Solid enough to be worth a watch (you won't curse the time you spent) but not good enough to be more than a 'likeable' film.",Null,1,2,20 February 2010
Mission: Impossible," A clever, tense and fun summer thriller
","The Mission: Impossible team is headed by Jim Phelps with point man Ethan Hunt.  On one mission his whole team is wiped out in front of his eyes leaving him to only survivor.  When he reaches his extraction point he finds that his ultimate boss, Kittridge is already in the town and that this mission was a mole hunt to discover who within Phelps's IMF team is a mole. Since Hunt is the only survivor they suspect him and he is forced on the run to discover the real mole.  Using other disavowed agents Hunt contacts the mysterious Max and agrees a daring robbery of files from the CIA in order to set a trap for the mole.Brian De Palma's film version was rushed on us in a wave of hype  the theme song itself sets the pulse racing a little quicker.  The film needed to stand up to scrutiny.  Happily the plot is good enough to get through the film.  It is complex but is full of holes at times  but it is enough to stop this being a dumb action movie.  Instead it is well set up and has some nice twists and turns along the way.De Palma's direction is good.  While he usually is strong in the big set pieces here he manages to do well with them and with the smaller tense settings.  The sets are always good and the whole film has a good feel to it.  The action scenes only resort to flashy OTT effects towards the end and the most of it is much better tense operations which are much more enjoyable.Although the film isn't great it's clever enough and enjoyable enough to rise above the level of the usual summer movie.  Cruise is really good here  all charm, smiles and determination.  Rhames is always good value  as is Reno.  In fact the whole cast do well and hold some pleasant surprises such as a very flirty Vanessa Redgrave.The weakness of this film is in the marketing  in the original trailer we are shown the money shot of the film.  Why?!  It was annoying the first time I saw it to see that I'd already seen `the end' months before it had come out!  But this is a minor complaint.Overall this isn't a classic but it feels very slick and has a pretty good plot.  De Palma's direction is strong whether it be the slanting angles of Hunt's confrontation with Kittridge or the tense robbery of the CIA and the action scenes are worth watching.  Wisely, when the film hits a weak point it just turns on the theme music and everything's better again!",Null,3,6,18 August 2002
La La Land," Pleasant enough but ultimately superficial and a little smug
","Blockbuster season and awards season - two periods of the year where it is easy to get caught up in the hype but not always easy to find really good films. In the awards time of year it is particularly hard since everyone is talking up films as much as possible, and lots of 'proper' films come out around then in order to qualify. Last year was no different and La La Land was one of the films that we were all told was a big contender and would surely merit its place surrounded by the great films that had gone before it. Years of disappointment has told me not to get caught up in the hype but just catch things later when they are cheaper and have lost their promotion. With La La Land, that time was now, but the distance has actually only hurt it.More on that in a minute. Generally speaking, La La Land is perfectly fine. It is a pleasant film that has charm and good grace mostly. It wallows in an image of Hollywood that doesn't exist, and fills its delivery with nostalgia and simplification; it is easy to see why it was so popular with those successfully in the industry, and those all hoping that their big break is just around the corner. As a story there is not much too it. The delivery isn't as charming as it needed to be; the musical numbers after that first great one are mostly only okay - they try hard, but they are only okay. The characters are thin, although they benefit from good performances - mostly from Stone, who I really enjoyed. It is nothing special, but it works in a sort of cheerful fantasy way.One year on though, and the #MeToo movement and associated revelations cast a different light on a young woman in Hollywood trying to get ahead. La La Land was a bit smug and fantastical before this, but after it has an air of denial to it too - unintended of course and not the film's fault, but it is there nonetheless, and the cheerful 'have a dream and get your break' theme stands out badly. Like I say though, not the film's fault - but even without that problem, the film is at best just pleasant to watch but not more.",Null,1,3,5 June 2018
Saw," Slick thriller in the mould of Se7en that covers writing weaknesses with consistent tension & urgency
","(This review contains no spoilers but it is better when you know very little about it and I would suggest not reading any reviews on the film but to just go and see it!)Adam wakes up in a bath of water to find himself in a dark room, chained to a large pipe. On the other side of the room is one Dr Lawrence Gordon, who finds himself in the same position, in the middle of the room is a dead man with a gun and a Dictaphone in his hand. Two recorded messages reveal that Gordon's wife and daughter have been kidnapped and will be killed at 6pm that same day. The only way this will not happen is if Gordon kills Adam before this time, a feat that will involve getting out of his chains and to the gun.The marketing campaign for this film had a very impacting poster with very little text and just the word 'SAW' on it. In a way, with no real bankable names in the cast to sell itself on, the film sold itself on the one thing that will always get audiences in  a concise and interesting central premise. Here it is very simple and very interesting and sets up a real tension from the outset that never really lets up until the very end. Let me just say now that tense is not the same as terrifying and viewers coming to this film looking for loads of gore and screaming horror will be let down; in fact I would class this film as a thriller more than I would a horror for this reason. The film opens with us right in this scenario of the chains etc and quickly we learn the ground rules and then learn more about the Jigsaw killer who is doing it. The flashbacks just take the edge off the main story a little bit but they do work well enough in themselves, and produce a more complex story.In a way this is where the weaknesses come in because the hook of the simple premise is expanded out into a wider story  and not all of it hangs together with a great deal of logic. The motives of the killer are unsure and the way that everything does fit into place is unconvincing (to name two problems) but, while it is on, the film's tension covers these gaps and does a good job of holding you in its spell. This spell lasts no longer than the final credits as you begin to pick holes in the actual story, but by then you'll have been entertained and into the film too much to really let the plot holes bother you and it is only those hoping for a story to match the darkness of Se7en will be letdown, this is not of the same caliber as that film but it is still fun. The director has learnt from several other films and genres. He knows that the simple premise can be used as a great hook for a simple story (many short films do the same), he knows from Se7en that sometimes the horror we imagine is much worse than the one we can see, and he knows from recent Japanese horror movies that unsettling images are scarier than outright gore (hence the use of clown and pig heads). In terms of style the film is winning if a little overdone. Time skips forward with frantic camera movements, 'dank' is painted thick on every scene and generally the film delivers a mood of tension, urgency and unsettling action.Not using the cast for the marketing was a good choice because there are no real a-list names here and, sadly, there are several botched jobs on the acting side. Whannell is good and does a solid job  even handling the script's 'comic relief' requirements without letting it take away from the dire nature of his situation. Elwes is OK but not as consistent. At times his delivery is flat and sounds like he is delivering some more serious lines in his 'Princess Bride' character, sounding insincere and wooden. It also didn't help that his make up for the majority of the film made him look like a tired old queen  I know it was supposed to be like white plastery stuff, but on Whannell it looked good but on Elwes it looked like it had been spread evenly! Glover is OK but given too little to do and his character changes too much too quickly before we have even known who he was.Support from people like Leung and Martinez add familiar faces and generally the support cast do OK  but in keeping with the simple premise idea, the film is best when it keeps those involved to the minimum.Overall this is an effective thriller. It will be compared to Se7en but it doesn't have the writing to really stand in the same crowd as that movie; the plot has too many holes and the twists often come from a desire to surprise and confound rather than coming as a natural part of the story (ie they don't have the common sense impact of Se7en's conclusion). However what it does do well is deliver a sense of tension and urgency focused on this 'simple' premise. This tension works so well that it pretty much covers the plot problems while you are watching the film, and you are swept along with it as you watch. After the film you'll pick away at it and it won't stand up to repeat viewings but it is still a great fun film while you're with it.",Null,44,91,10 October 2004
Super 8," Gets the spirit of those throwback family sci-fi films just right, but takes the weaker aspects with it
","I'm not adding anything to the discussion by noting that Super 8 is deliberately and professionally a throwback to those family-friendly sci-fi films of the 80's. Explorers comes to mind, as does Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies. However, for as many people observing this, not enough of them appear to be happy to accept some of the weaknesses that Super 8 also carries forward into 2011. The story here is that a group of high-school students are making an amateur short film on a friend's super 8 camera when a massive crash occurs and they flee just as, for some reason, the military move in to take control. Shortly it transpires that 'something' may have been in the train and is now loose in this small town community.The set-up is classic and by choosing to set the film in this time period it works even better because it is able to be mostly free of modern cynicism or reference points and manages to capture a sort of image of childhood and small-town life that may never have existed but certainly a lot of people of my age will have already been sold on since we grew up on the films this one is referencing. In this regard I can understand why the main love for Super 8 appears to be from a certain age-group, not to suggest others do not enjoy it, but certainly the nostalgic sense of familiarity with the tone and approach did add a bit for me on my viewing. The gentle comic bantering between the characters is great stuff and it frames the film and provides enjoyment and colour around the sci-fi action.This action is not quite as good but again it hearkens back to days where seeing the creature is less important than seeing what it does. It worked for me and I was more than happy to see the destruction played out in a teasing way as it was. Those expecting Cloverfield 2 though, will be disappointed as it is not that type of film. Although it is a throwback, it is impressive how well Abrams captures the spirit and content of these films of that period. I'm not a massive fan of his because at times he seems all about the hype of the moment rather than the lasting substance, but here he does a solid job. The downside of this is that he also captures the sentimentality and rather pat endings of these films. I accepted this as being a genre thing but the ending still is a little weak as a result. I also thought he overdid the lens-flare effect, it is a nice touch done sparingly but here it seems to be in almost every scene and it got on my nerves.Overall though Super 8 is a great little throwback film that will play best with those of us of an age to no longer fancy another noisy and hollow effects films this summer but rather something that benefits from a nostalgic warmth. It does really well at catching this spirit and content and for that it deserves credit even if the downside is that it captures the weaknesses as well. Fun and engaging if you let yourself get in an 80's frame of reference.",Null,2,3,28 August 2011
The Last Samurai," Is OK but is too dull & long for an action movie and too confused for the worthy, thoughtful mantel it tries to take on (spoilers)
","Washed up and weary soldier Capt Nathan Algren is offered a job training the Emperor of Japan's troops, the money is too good to turn down.  Rushed into taking his inexperienced troops into battle, they are over run and he is captured by the Samurai, however leader Katsumoto allows him to life and takes him back to their village.  Algren finds that his desire to learn of his enemy is replaced by an understanding and empathy with their aims over the more mercenary forces pulling the Emperor's strings.The Oscar talk seemed to begin even before this film finished post-production and the interviews about the film have rarely done anything other than gush about `Ed', `Tom' or the epic way of the Samurai.  However viewing the film it is hard to leave the cinema without a feeling of a film that mixes action with long periods of dullness and ultimately confuses itself and the audience as to it's actual point.  The plot manages to avoid any strands of originality and if you are unable to guess the direction of the film after 10 minutes then something is wrong.  The ending of the film is about as perfect an example of what a cop out it was and is dreary rather than exciting.  Sure it has big epic battles that the director proudly boasts contain no CGI, but these are a small part of the running time and yet it seems more effort went into these than any other aspect of the film.Certainly the plot could have done with a great deal more work - it can't sustain the running time and too much of it is slow; I'm sure this was done because the subject is worthy and `epic' (which often means long and slow, not a problem for those that deserve it), however here the film doesn't warrant it and the end result is it being slightly dull.  The film suffers from the fact that it doesn't know what moral stance it wants to take - this is made more obvious by the fact that (in the UK) this film and Cold Mountain came out quite close to one another.  Whereas Mountain has the clear view that war is hell regardless of the worthiness of the reason, Samurai wants war to be both hellish AND honourable.  Hence the film has to make Algren's experiences MORE hellish by having his unit killing innocents, so that `normal' war can be seen as something good in a sense.  The cast and audience share this confusion.  Algren's fate at the end of the film is more Hollywood than Samurai and Watanabe (who played Katsumoto) has spoken in interviews of the difficulties he had of relating to a character who would lead hundreds to certain death for `honour'.The film settles on the idea that dying for a cause is honourable and offers good deaths for those who die and redemption for Algren.  For the sections of the audience who think about that, it is a difficult thing to swallow. I didn't think about it till I got home and saw the news of yet another suicide bombing in the Middle East.  The film's point about the honour of the Samurai versus the West is OK until when dealing with honour among men and the ideas of a balanced society.  However when you carry it as far as this film does then you are saying that `an honourable man will not meet someone halfway - if he believes he is right he will give his life, no matter how difficult it seems'.  Sadly this is what the 9/11 killers did, this is what suicide bombers do and I found the film very difficult to accept when it appeared that it was promoting this.  I know of course that this was not the intention of the film - but by failing to have a grip on what it was doing below the surface, this film does just that.The script is full of Oriental wonderings and fortune cookie sentiment that prevent the audience ever really getting close to the characters.  Cruise is OK but his role isn't as deep and tortured as he thinks it is.  It is really quite an obvious role and, while doing OK as a movie star, he cannot do much from an acting point of view.  Does he deserve an Oscar? Yes he does - but for Magnolia, not for this!  Watanabe deserves a nomination for Supporting Actor and I hope he gets that (but not the award) for he does a good job of making this man likeable where, were he alive today he would be classed a terrorist.  His confusion of the character has been well hidden and I felt he was a good actor for being able to do that.  Atherton plays the `baddie' of the piece (it's Hollywood - there has to be one or the audience gets confused), while Spall and Connolly add colour but not much else.  The Japanese support cast are all OK but none are given characters and are left in `honourable' clichés.  The only interesting one was Koyuki's Taka (who struggles having the man who killed her husband in her house) but this is given precious little screen time.The script and confused politics are not Zwick's fault and he does well with what he can do - the scenery looks great and the film generally have a good oriental feel to it in setting, costume, sets and movement.  However this film is only OK.  As an action movie it is too long and dull.  As a meaningful epic, it is confused and not worthy of the aspirations that it has.  I left wondering what all the fuss was about despite taking something from it overall.",Null,1,10,18 January 2004
Up," Hits the heart early and follows up with a tremendously engaging and entertaining adventure
","I keep waiting for Pixar to let me down by delivering a good film that only disappoints by virtue of it not quite being up to the high standards set by previous films and, while Up is not quite as strong in some regards as some of their previous films, it is definitely a very good film that sits easily amongst their impressive catalogue. Up opens with a montage that spans about 70 years but yet succeeds in making you understand the main character and also feel for him and it makes it look like it was the easiest thing in the world to do. Without any pat sentimentality or exploitative tricks or cues, the film is quite moving from the very start and it means that the viewer is right there from the very start.It doesn't quite keep this up though because, although it does still have an emotional heart (thanks to the good work in the opening 10 minutes), the film is much more about the adventure. This does work really well even if it does all get a little bit silly as it goes along and adds talking dogs on top of flying houses etc, however the key thing is that you go with it , mainly because of how well it hooks you into the scenario from the very start. It also helps that on top of being exciting and engaging, it is also very funny indeed. Full of amusing aspects as well as specific funny jokes, the film doesn't separate some jokes for the kids and some for the adults but rather has good clean material with strong timing and delivery that makes it easily appreciable by the largest range of ages. The talking dog was my personal favourite but generally every character moved things along in regards action, drama and comedy.Needless to say the animation is brilliant. I did not see this in 3D but it is still gorgeous to behold, with the small personal effects being just as well done as the broad sweep of the fantasy scenario. The animation of the characters is great because it manages to convey such information in the tiny reactions or gestures of the characters – hard to imagine how one would do that in terms of capturing this performance detail not to mention the technical aspects. Asner does great voice work in the lead role, while Nagai does well to avoid being no more than an irritating 'cute kid' but is actually a good presence. Peterson's timing as Doug is great while Plummer is suitably threatening and of course Ratzenberger gets a slot as normal.Up is a great film, probably my favourite of the year by some distance. The film hits the heart early with an impacting opening 15 minutes that sucks the viewer in and makes it look easy at the same time, then follows up with a solid slice of family-friendly adventure that is as thrilling as it is funny. Another in a succession of incredibly good films from Pixar.",Null,4,8,17 January 2010
The Hurricane," An enjoyable film but suffers from being too black and white (if you can excuse the pun)
","Framed by a white cop for a murder he didn't commit, boxer Ruben 'Hurricane' Carter tries to free himself from the constrains of his cell mentally by studying, picking over his case and writing his autobiography. Seven years later, Carter is still in prison with appeal after appeal being turned down, but his book has found its way into the hands a young student, Lesra who is inspired to study by the lessons in his book. As the two get to know one another through letters and meetings, Lesra and his teachers devote themselves to getting Carter freedom through a successful appeal.Despite the fact that the basics of the story is interesting and compelling, this film only manages to be reasonable entertaining rather than compelling because it never really goes deeper than the basics. The story of a man wrongfully imprisoning and yet, somehow, overcoming that is going to be worth a look as it offers enough human interest for me to give it a try, but the problem here is that the film will give you a very basic look at the story and this basic feel will stop you getting involved in the story and maybe even make you wonder how much of it has been simplified down. Enough elements of the film remain interesting to cover this gap though and the character of Carter is interesting and semi-inspiring as he is portrayed here; I say 'as portrayed here' because I do not know how real this person I have seen here is. Part of the problem may be Jewison himself as his background is of a time where things could be as simple as, literally, black and white  but he brings that view to this movie and the story (and even the truth) appear to suffer as a result.In Jewison's world there is no complex issues, no legal technicalities, no nothing  there is only a good black man who has been framed by bitter, racist cops even though everything points to his innocence; and boy, does Jewison spread it on thick! We trace Paterson's hatred of Carter all the way back to childhood and a scene where he comments on Carter's boxing fame just so we are totally clear that he wanted Carter more than anything! It's a real shame because the truth must be more interesting than this, although I imagine a lot more complex and for the film to just present such a clear cut and simplistic view of real life events not only insults the intelligence of the audience, it also does a disservice to the real life events it represents.The cast are a big reason most of the film is interesting, or rather Denzel is a big reason it works. How close his Carter is to the real Carter is anyone's guess but his dialogue and his performance are both great. Washington made me believe this man's inner struggle by looks, words, tone of voice  this is the performance he deserved his Oscar for, not the more showy (and less controversial) one in Training Day. Shannon is also good even if he is far from central to the film. Unger, Schreiber and Hannah have clearly been told to play 'non-threatening white people' and they are all about as bland as a collection of people as I have seen. There is no meat on their characters and, as a result the three just play them very simple, basic and far too 'nice' to be believable; I'm not suggesting we have more detail on their lives but there was nothing to them whatsoever  a real problem when they are asked to carry some scenes near the end by themselves. Hedaya gets paid with a lazy 'racist cop' role that he can do nothing with, while Brown is OK in a return to his Shawshank role. Pastore, Steiger, Yulin and Paymer all add the feeling of depth in minor roles but really this is Washington's film and he is a big reason I found it entertaining.Overall this was potentially an interesting, compelling and emotional film based on an intriguing real life story of injustice. However the script simplifies the story and characters to the point of being almost a version for people in a rush or without the intelligence to understand more. I cannot understand why the film just brushed past areas that would have made it more interesting (albeit more morally complex) and Jewison is to blame for a film that is very black and white in the portrayal of circumstances and its characters. Washington's performance and well written dialogue makes the film worth seeing but I was surprised by the film's ability to take an interesting and compelling story and simplify it to the point of lacking any real punch (sorry  he starts with a pun and he ends with a pun!). Watch once but there are much better examples of the genre and much better sources for hearing Carter's story.",Null,17,30,10 July 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Interesting but flawed
","In England Alex and his droogs are just one of many small gangs of youths who live for thrills experienced through ultra-violence and forced in and out with girls.  Internal conflict with his droogs sees Alex abandoned at a crime scene where he is arrested.  Faced with 14 years in jail Alex tries to get involved in a new Government led initiative to rehabilitate criminals.I imagine I'm in the same boat as many users here.  I first saw Clockwork Orange many years ago on a pirate copy where the words `sound quality' and `visual sharpness' didn't play any part.  It wasn't till recently that I was able to watch it on a screen without squinting, when Kubrick's ban was lifted in the UK.  At this point I waited several years till it came to TV before revisiting it  I wanted to watch it away from media hype and make my own mind up.What I found was a film that was taking it's points from the debate that was going on at the time over treatment of criminals.  The plot is worthy and does set up a situation that becomes more relevant every year in the UK  that of violent disaffected youth.  However Kubrick doesn't look at the wider impact of society on Alex, he only looks at Alex and how he is treated now by society.  His life consists of sex and violence  all for thrills, a picture that is all too realistic.  However only in the second half does Kubrick make some strong points about the nature of people and how society can be as cruel as individuals.Most of the film is a sort of arty porn type of film.  That's not to criticise it for this, but it does feel like Kubrick is concentrating more on style rather than content.  Visually the film works well, even if some of the scenes of sexual violence I felt were more than they needed to be and it felt like it was revelling in the very things it was criticising.  However at it's heart the story is a good idea and it is told in a weird way that holds the attention.Alex's weird childlike use of made up words make it feel like he really is a teenager trying to create a world different from his parents and plenty of the images show the reality of his world.  McDowell delivers another great performance and effortlessly carries the film.  However his constant swagger could be criticised for being too much, but at the key moments of weakness he brings out Alex's fear well.  The rest of the support cast give good Orwellian authority figures or vengeful victims well.Overall this film is worth watching once simply because of the hype.  Now that it's no longer banned it will lose much of the credit it gave you when you could tell people that you'd seen it (now every school kid can rent it on video!) and may lose some critical support as a result.  McDowell is great but Kubrick works harder on his style than making clear, strong points through narrative.",Null,12,25,26 October 2002
The Legend of 1900," Whimsical and unlikely yet touching and wonderful
","A man, Max, walks into a pawn shop to sell his trumpet.  While playing it one last time, the owner puts on a record that sparks memories in Max and is the very reason he has returned to New York.  Max tells the story of a boiler worker on board the cruise ship The Virginian who finds a baby left on New Years day 1900.  He keeps the boy on board and raises him  naming him `Danny Boon TD Lemon 1900'.  When the boilerman is killed, 1900 stays on board and discovers a gift for playing the piano and is famous across the ship.  However, Max insists that 1900 has never, in 40 odd years, left the ship and is desperate to convince the demolition crew (about to demolish the ship out at sea) that 1900 must still be on board.When I sat to watch this film I had no idea what it was about and had never so much as read a review  I just thought I'd give it a go as I had little else to do.  I am very glad that I did and would urge anyone else with the chance to see this film to do so.  The plot is very unlikely and very slight when it comes to details but it has a real whimsy to it that really keeps things moving alone really well.  Add to this the beauty of the music and it really gives the film a nice flow that stops it dragging.  The device of having Max tell the story and running the two time lines beside each other also really kept the story moving.The light mood of the film changes later to slightly more serious drama but by then I was sucked in by the lightness and the change was not too heavy and was all the more moving for the light touch that had gone beforehand. True, it all is a bit (very!) unlikely and some bits of it feel like the bigger idea had come first and the details had been sketched in later, but this is a minor flaw as the film is perfectly pitched (excuse the pun) with a light feel that carries everything else.From the first meeting of Max and 1900 to the emotional but easily foreseen climax the film is a mix of emotion and whimsy that works very well.  Roth is an OK (if not great) actor and only occasionally seems stretched here. For the most part he is good but I do find his squeaky voice annoying the odd time.  Vince was excellent in heavy and I was glad to see him again here  his role is strong and he does well.  Smaller roles such as Nunn and Williams III are good and everyone in support helps the comic yet emotional tone of the piece.  The direction is superb and again sets the mood well. The film suffers once from a poor projection on the ship's hull but other than that sets are great be they the growing city or the ballroom of the ship.Is this a classic?  no.  Is it a light film that effortlessly sucks you into an emotional story?  yes.  If you're in the mood for something like this then this is the film for you.  The moment I finished watching it I wanted to see it again and go and give the tape to my friends to see, it really is that enjoyable.",Null,1,2,1 February 2003
Where Eagles Dare," Classic, boys-own, war time romp
","A military group made up of six British and one American soldiers parachute behind enemy lines in order to rescue an important British General from the German fortress the Shloss Alder - a mountain top castle accessible only by cable car. Once on the ground one of their group are murdered and the leader Smith suspects a double agent instead the unit. He decides to continue with the mission regardless - but is the aim of the mission as straight forward as he is telling the others.This is a classic bit of war time adventure. Made possible because Burton wanted to do it because his son wanted to see Daddy in an action movie, this is far superior from most other Alistair McLean adaptations. The story is pure boys own' style adventure - but the source material is clever enough to hold the interest. The truth behind the mission is hinted up for a while before being revealed - it isn't earth shattering but Smith's handling of the situation is very cleverly done and fun to watch. The story goes go downhill a little in the `escape' section - up till then it's all quiet and espionage stuff, however to get out of the castle they merely blow everything up! They also manage to take on the whole German army, picking out targets easily while never getting hit themselves. However this is a minor complaint as some of the action scenes are great - notably the cable car scenes.Burton is an unlikely action figure but plays the gentleman officer very well, and is totally believable when the twists come in the middle. Eastwood is very young but is suitably brash for the American Schaffer - fans may also be interested to know that his body count is higher in this film than any other in his career. Support is generally good but it's mainly Burton and Eastwood who carry the film.Overall it's a classic bit of escapism set in WW2. It's quite silly at times but has a clever story to prop up the action.",Null,3,5,5 June 2003
The Fly," Great remake  horror with a typically Cronenbergian twist
","Scientist Seth Brundle has created a matter transporter to create a sort of teleporting system.  During tests he finds it turns his monkeys inside out and kills them, until he gets it to work.  He immediately tests it on himself and everything appears to work well.  However he soon finds himself going through a series of changes, much to the concern of his girlfriend Ronnie, that see him becoming fitter and stronger.  However it isn't long the changes become more concerning and it is clear that he is changing beyond his control and beyond recognition.Cronenberg is famous for his body horror and here is no exception.  The remake of The Fly loses a lot of his usual social comment etc but still leaves him open to do a great horror that has some intelligent touches.  The story is very much a horror  but Cronenberg has got rid of the concept of swapping a fly head for a human head and replaced it with the horror coming from within.  This allows him to feel more comfortable with his subject matter rather than it being silly.  The transformation gets more intense towards the end as his whole body begins to become a fly but the early parts allow tension to be built up.When the gore comes it is typical Cronenberg.  It isn't gore for comedy's sake it is quite shocking and very gory.  The real gore is kept for 2 or 3 key moments and is all the more shocking for the restrained nature of it's use up till then.  The end itself shows that it isn't just an out and out horror and that it does have a heart and a head to match it's strong stomach.Goldblum is good.  Unfortunately he has come to be type cast as the excitable, Jewish scientist with a distinct speaking manner (try Jurassic Park 1 & 2, Cats and Dogs etc).  However here it doesn't annoy too much. Davis is also very good and was going into a good run of hits (unlike now!) at the time.  She plays the horror of her situation very well.Overall The Fly is a very good remake.  It is a horror film that is actually chilling as well as gory  Cronenberg's fascination with body horror and the nature of ourselves is toned down but is still enough in evidence to add something.",Null,14,20,13 June 2002
From Hell," Moody horror that covers the holes in it's plot with a great atmos-fear
","In 1888, Inspector Abberline investigates the case of `Jack the Ripper', who is murdering his through a group of poor whores on London's streets.  As he grows close to one of the prostitutes, he also begins to detect a conspiracy that is higher than he suspected.Adapted from the Alan Moore/Eddie Campbell comic this is a dark little horror movie.  The story opens and closes with Abberline in an opium den (draw your assumptions from that) and follows his investigation into the murders of several whores.  The story uncovers a conspiracy that involves police, special branch, masons, surgeons and perhaps royalty.  The middle section is the one you need to be focused during - at one time there are quite a few possibilities bouncing around and you need to concentrate. However in the latter stages the story is clearer as the Ripper is revealed - although his portrayal as a psycho and an intelligent controlled man don't sit well together.Story aside the film's strength is in it's direction, it's sets, costume and total sense of place and mood.  The sets are excellent and 19th century London is well recreated.  The mood brought to the streets at night also deserves praise, the camera moves around shadowy streets - however it does it without cheap `jump out of shadows' teen-slasher style tricks, here it is more a sense of fear than a series of sudden shocks.  The directors bring plenty of fresh tricks to the story - plenty of imaginative scenes (including one where a victim lies still while the action around her body speeds up to get to the morning), and there are plenty of quick cuts and edits to make us create our own horror.  The creation of unseen horror is well done by the sound effects - there are plenty of blade noises, cutting of skin etc - you don't see it onscreen, but you can't help but see it.The film most horrible idea is of London ruled by a cold Queen who only sees poor subjects as things or material to be worked with.  This idea is played through the elite - the masons are happy to do anything to achieve their aims, experimental surgery is played out in front of audiences and the disfigured are not seen as people.  This concept, added to the excellent mood and direction make up for the weaknesses in the plot and the occasional bad performance.Depp is good as Abberline - a stronger willed man that his Sleepy Hollow character, and manages to do a good accent for most of the film.  Heather Graham is not as good - she's too pretty to be one of the whores and her accent wavers regularly between London and LA.  She is good for most of her scenes, but her scenes with the rest of her whores seem overdone by all the ladies.  The group of women all seem to be saying their dialogue extra loud and with extra accent - I can't really describe it but they don't feel natural.  The rest of the cast are filled out with excellent Brits - Holm, Richardson, Rhys and a small role for a well known face in Lock, Stock's Jason Flemyng as coach driver Netley.Overall this is good - the fear is instilled through sound, mood and shadows.  The final 15 minutes feels like it reverts to a standard thriller with a standard mad bad guy, and the end may be a little too happy - but just remember it opens AND closes with Abberline off on opium (get it?).",Null,5,11,4 February 2002
Groundhog Day," Very enjoyable comedy that is totally driven by a great Bill Murray
","Weather man Phil goes to a small village in Western Pennsylvania to cover the start of spring on Groundhog Day.  Despite his cynical approach to the whole thing he gets through the day but gets trapped in the town by a blizzard.  However he finds that he is doomed to repeat the same day over and over again bringing him out in a series of reactions until he can work out what he is meant to learn.The premises sounds silly  who would want to watch the same day over and over again? Even if it is a comedy?  However with Harold Ramis in control this easily becomes something better than it sounds.  The plot may be a sentimental thing at the end of the day but since the plot is simple it leaves a lot of space for things to repeat.  The message when it comes is good  about becoming a better person and learning to care for others being the most important stage.The key to the film however is the space where things just repeat.  This leaves Bill Murray plenty of time to let his sarcastic wit run riot  whether it be cruel as at the start or more gentle towards the end.  His impact on the film is immeasurable.  Unless you hate him then he makes the whole film work.The rest of the cast is made up of plenty of well-known faces from similar comedy films.  Andie MacDowell may not have been the best choice for a love interest but she's actually not too bad compared to how vapid she can be. The rest of the cast has the likes of Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky, Doyle-Murphy etc  a whole pile of `where have I seen him before' types.
Overall this is a very enjoyable comedy from a good director and great star. The film is a good idea but it is totally brought to life by a wonderful performance by Murray.  The film may well be a slight comedy at heart but it is very enjoyable.",Null,11,21,29 June 2002
National Treasure," Distracting and better than the sequel but still not much cop
","Adventurer and archaeologist Ben Gates is following his lifelong quest for a legendary treasure with his team and searching for a lost ship which contains the treasure. No treasure is found but they do locate a clue that suggests a map to the treasure's location is somehow hidden on the back on the Declaration of Independence. Ben gives it up there and then but his colleague, Ian Howe, decides to go after the Declaration himself  even if it means stealing it. Left for dead with geek Riley, Ben decides to stop Howe, but with the authorities sceptical to say the least, the only way he can do it is get to the map and treasure before Howe can.After hating the sequel, it would be a fair question to ask as to why I bothered watching the first one. Well my reasoning was that I didn't believe that the first film could have been that bad if so many people went to see it. The first film clearly has a lot in common with the second film and in a way I disliked it in the same sort of way. Writing this now I realise one thing  if I review this against the sequel I will either end up moaning about it due to the things it has in common or praising it because 'at least it is still better than the sequel', so instead I will just try and review it without a connection to the bad experience I had.Watching it on its own terms it is hard to deny that the plot is a bit daft and I did struggle to get into it at times. Fortunately it minimises the daftness of the clues and, more importantly, the number of them that have to be followed and as a result it didn't tire me out that much. Of course what the silliness does mean is that the film cannot create a sense of tension, urgency or danger. This does keep it in kiddie territory although (sorry to do this) it is much less frequent that all the terrible 'wacky' rubbish in the sequel. On the whole though, the film did just about enough to keep my interest and make me suspend my disbelief but not enough to really excite or engage me. It is hard to see it as anything other than a poor man's Indiana Jones.The cast are roundly so-so, a reflection of the material perhaps but here we are. Cage is all a bit too smug and knowing to draw the audience into the story and I do think that he is a part of the failing in this regard. Kruger is so-so and I suppose at least Bartha is quite fun in his character. Bean is a poor villain with a division one footballer's haircut. Voight, Keitel and Plummer are all pretty much slumming it in small roles and offer nothing other than their faces to the film.Even without comparing it to the sequel, National Treasure is only a so-so film. The lack of urgency and danger leaves the silliness of the film rather exposed. It does just about manage to minimise the wackiness and stupidity that the sequel suffered heavily from and it does distract but it is certainly no better than that.",Null,1,3,1 June 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Simply brilliant; short, tight and taut
","Crime boss Joe Cabot brings together a group of criminals to perform a big one-off job.  To protect each other, they all use colour coded names. However on the day of the job, the police ambush the gang and each makes their own getaway.  As the gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within the gang must have tipped the police or be an undercover.  The accusations and suspicions escalate into violence in the confines of the warehouse.When this film came out in the UK it caused an absolute firestorm of controversy over it's violence, even to the point that it was banned in the UK for a while.  I still find this absurd and am very glad we have moved to a more tolerant society where generally the BBFC protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide for themselves.  Looking at the media's adoring welcome for the ultra violent Kill Bill one can't help but marvel at how things have changed.  Looking at Reservoir Dogs now (or even then!) it simply isn't THAT violent.  However what it is is very sudden and all the more powerful for it.Tarantino directs the film and writes the film in such a way that it was impossible to ignore him even if the film was only a cult hit.  The dialogue is both witty at points but, more importantly, very tough and loaded with testosterone.  It is the writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at the start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into a backseat bloodbath.  The entire job happens off camera, and only occasionally do we actually see the immediate effect of violence - usually we get the aftermath.  It is incredibly tight and very tense throughout, I was about 16 when my father took me to see this film - it has stayed with me since and I still considered it to be one of the best `job gone wrong' films of my generation.  It may not be original (there's a thin line between a homage and a rip off) but it is certainly effectively done.The cast are excellent and turn the hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes.  Keitel is wonderful.  His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others.  Likewise Buscemi is wide-eyed and freaking out for much of the film, but he does it well.  Roth is more balanced but is still good for it; it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well, despite a wandering American accent at times.  Madsen is great, maybe not the best character but wildly out of control.  Tierney was a great piece of casting, as was Bunker.  Penn is good but not the best of the cast.Tarantino mercifully has little acting to do, but it is his film as writer and director.  The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well - mixing stories with flashbacks and so on.  No matter what the time of the scene, it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what - it is tight and tense, macho, violent, funny and very enjoyable.",Null,93,135,28 January 2004
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Solid but damaged by the slant towards the Republican point of view
","The English occupy Ireland with a brutal and harsh hand but Damien intends to pursue his medical career. However when a young friend is beaten to death for no reason, Damien decides to join up with the armed resistance to try and force the British out of Ireland. Somehow finding the stomach for the acts he commits, Damien follows his brother Teddy in the field, fighting side by side with one common aim. However, as some form of progress is made, the brothers (and the movement) find themselves splitting onto different, conflicting roads.Let me deal with the big complaint first  that this is a pro-IRA, pro-terrorist film. Those making this argument in a strong way tend to be like myself and be from a Protestant background or at least have more knowledge of that side of the argument Conversely, those that claim that it is just a fair piece of history with no bias would tend to be the reverse. The truth is somewhere in the middle because, while the film is not supporting or totally justifying the IRA and terrorism, it does certainly excuse their actions to a point. Those who cannot see this are perhaps a bit too close or a bit too remote from the material  imagine the same film with Iraqi insurgents replacing the Irish and the USA replacing the British and you'll perhaps understand more why it is a touchy subject.By having all the British be brutal but yet showing Damien killing because it is somehow the right thing to do, Loach cannot be surprised by such accusations? However this is not to say that the film is all that biased, because it does generally show the civil war as just as bad and just as pointlessly bloody; it is just a shame that it doesn't judge one side as harshly as it does the other  so when the Irish start killing their own, it is shown as something they hate, as opposed to all the British who actively enjoy doing it. It does still seem to condemn the violence of the land, but I must admit hoping for more from Loach  perhaps not a totally even hand because that is not what history tells us this was, but perhaps more depth that doesn't appear to put everything at the feet of the British. One could also question the aim of Loach in making this film late last year, at a time when the Northern Ireland peace process was still on the edge of disaster (although in fairness, anytime in the last decade one could say the same).As director, Loach doesn't quite manage to produce the natural tone that is his style when he is on his game. However the performances are still pretty solid even if the characters do tend to be slanted towards being sympathetic. Murphy is perhaps the most guilty of this and this was a problem even though his cool presence is welcome here. Delaney works better as his brother, mainly because the material doesn't give him as easy a ride. The support cast are mostly solid enough although I do have a confession to make here and now. Despite being from Northern Ireland, I did have to put the subtitles on while watching it  not for every line but for sufficient difficult accents to make it worth doing. Given that I should have had more of a chance that, say, American viewers, this is probably worth baring in mind for the casual viewer.Overall then this is a solid enough historical piece that does a so-so job of showing the violence and pointless bloodshed of the period and place. Although it is not a glory piece for the IRA, it does slant rather towards the Republicans as 'the good guys', which was disappointing from Loach  not because I think the British are the good guys (they are not) but because anyone who knows the situation knows that one side is as bad as the other and it would have been nice for Loach to scale down the slightly romanticised view of his freedom fighters here.",Null,22,39,12 July 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," Solidly enjoyable across the board – but again falls short of the high bar set by Pixar
","I've said it before but I'll say it again here and that is that it is unfair of Dreamworks to have to compete with the consistently high quality of Pixar films – films that deliver so strongly on so many aspects across the board. I say this because I did really enjoy HTTYD but still found myself wondering how much more character, emotion and comedy Pixar would have brought to the same story. This is unfair of me but yet I cannot help it. HTTYD is a great little tale where a Viking boy learns about the enemy (the dragon) and finds that perhaps everything he has been taught about them is a lie or, at best, one big misunderstanding. The moral of the film is pretty clear as is the general direction of the narrative.This doesn't stop it being engaging and entertaining though because it is. The story plays out well and is funny and had me interested and caring throughout, while the characters were solid. Problem is that all of it is good – but yet none of it excels. So on the characters: they are all solid and do what is required but none really absorbed me to the point I forget they were cartoon creations voiced by actors. Likewise the comedy, it was consistently amusing and had a few nice touches here and there but the side characters didn't provide the depth or comedic value that Pixar so often manages to do with their equivalents. But it is still good stuff though and children will love it while adults will find it easy to enjoy – I watched with no children and only another adult in their 30's and none of it came over as 'below us' or aimed at children with no appeal to us – which, for all my critical comparison, is a hard thing to achieve but this did it well.The animation is very good of course but in particular they have done the action sequences very well, making them exciting and intense without being hard to follow or see what is happening. The voice cast are mostly OK but they do all suffer from the inability to make their characters real. Baruchel is solid enough in the lead but not great. Likewise Butler turns in another 'meh' performance for me but at least here his Scottish brogue helps him and his lack of screen charisma doesn't hurt his voice work. Ferguson is a better piece of casting as his voice is fun and he seems to have a natural humour about him – I don't like his show myself but he did work well here. Beyond them there isn't the dept I would have liked. Hill was so-so, Likewsie Ferrara and Mintz-Plasse – although none of them really impress me too much in other films so no surprise that they don't here either. Solid work by all, but nobody really hit it out of the park.Overall HTTYD is an enjoyable and entertaining family film that delivers comedy, a good story and thrills to good effect. It doesn't excel in any specific area when viewed on an open field though but, while watching it the film keeps you involved enough so that the comparisons to Pixar occur after, not during the film.",Null,9,18,17 October 2010
Total Recall," One of Arnie's best Â– an action movie with a very good core plot
","In 2020, Douglas feels he needs a break from the day to day life and goes to Total Recall Â– where memories are planted in your head to make you think you are someone else for a while Â– a holiday in your head if you will.  However before he can be injected he begins to have flashbacks and suddenly finds that people are trying to kill him and that somehow he must get to Mars to uncover the reasons.  However what is truth and what is fake and is the whole thing really happening or not?Based on a Phillip K. Dick story this was always going to be intelligent Â– however it's surprising that Verhoeven manages to keep that core well.  The plot allows his excessive violence but is also a great story that more than holds the interest with twists and turns and neither Douglas or us fully knowing what's going on.  The action is great Â– even 10 or so years on, and the tension just stays solid throughout.Schwarzenegger does his usual invincible muscles stuff and looks happy blasting crowds, but he is also OK in other areas too.  Tictin is good but never repeated this success for herself.  The baddies (or maybe not?) are the best roles Â– solid baddies like Ironside and Cox are just as good as they were in other similar roles and Sharon Stone is good as Douglas' wife.Overall this continues Verhoeven's trend of making ultra-violence and clever plots and satire work well together (Robocop, Starship Troopers and this) as opposed to his trend of making trash!  Everything about this film works well Â– whether it be the action or the acting or the plot Â– a surprisingly nice package for a violent action movie!",Null,61,81,17 July 2002
Rocky," A good Hollywood button pusher
","Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa is a small time boxer who has taken to collecting debts for a local mobster.  However when he is picked as an easy fight for champ Apollo Creed he sees his chance to make it.  With help and hindrance from his fellow blue-collar workers he seeks to climb out of his situation.The film that launched Stallone as a mainstream star and proves that he has more brains than many of his roles may let you think.  Stallone wrote this passable story of working class boy makes good in a few days after watching Ali v's Wepner in a brave fight.  He sold the rights to the story on the condition that he would star.  He was also brave enough to turn down $150,000 to give up the role.  The story is nothing hugely special  a working class boxer makes it big through sweat, grit and pure determination, but it's done with a great amount of emotion and walks the line between plausibility and smaltz well.The film's buildup just manages to avoid being totally clichéd and some of the dialogue is a little corny  however what lifts the film is the final fight.  The fight is one of the most unrealistic in cinema  this is no Raging Bull!  However it is a pure exploitative bit of cinema.  The effort of Stallone, the sweeping music, the tension etc all hits the right buttons and involves us well.  It may not be wonderful but it's certainly a prime example of a Hollywood movie.Stallone is good and was Oscar nominated, but Burgess Meredith is excellent as an old boxer turned trainer.  Talia Shire is pretty good as Adrian but her character comes out of herself a little too easily.  Carl Weathers is good as Creed, but doesn't have too much to do.Overall this isn't a classic but it works well as a sort of `rags to riches' tale and as a good old Hollywood button pusher.  The only problem with it is the line of increasingly poor sequels that followed.",Null,3,13,14 April 2002
Shine," Wonderful little story that is interesting for the majority but heartbreaking at times
","David is a stuttering, rambling man having suffer a complete breakdown as a young man.  However when he was a child his skills on the piano were unmatched.  Driven by his father, opportunities open up in front of him to go abroad to learn, but his father denies him the chance.  He leaves for London where he drives himself to the point of exhaustion before coming back home to find his father has disowned him.It took me years to finally watch this film. I was still in Northern Ireland when it came out in the cinema and such films were not permitted to cross our borders, lest they keep the latest action movies from our 1 or 2 screen cinemas!  So away from the hype and the Oscar hoopla I sat to watch this film and found myself easily taken in by it.  The story is the true story of David Helfgott who was a boy genius before his breakdown.  The film starts with him as an adult then jumps back to see him as a child.  This approach works well to allow us to see the `end result' as it were, before we see what would be considered the causation factors.  These factors are a little heart breaking to watch but they are very well delivered.  As an adult, David is comic, warming and tragic.  The pain in his life is brought out very well.A great deal of the praise for this must lie with the wonderful cast. Rush got his Oscar of course and I'll leave it to the users on the message boards to argue over whether or not you can be the lead actor with screen time of less than half the film!  He is great, walking a difficult line with a `disabled' character but managing not to just make it a caricature at any point.  David as a child is very well played by Rafalowicz and does more of the development work than Rush and hence gets less credit than he deserves for making us care for the adult David.  Mueller-Stahl is as good as he can be and gives a great performance, the only downside being that he doesn't age a single day between the adult and child sections of the story - surely some makeup could have been used?Overall this is a very enjoyable human story that is driven by several really strong performances in key roles.  The story keeps it's tone light but yet still manages to be dramatic and, in some scenes far too touching to avoid being slightly moved.  The music is beautiful when it is called on to be and dramatic at other times - the director does very well to make the intense music translate into intense scenes in the film.  Overall a simple story of a man but one that is interesting and a lot more moving that I expected it to be.",Null,37,47,28 January 2004
Sicario," Brooding thriller with murky morals which is strong enough to carry it through a final third that is not quite what the majority of the film is
","Aside from hearing positive things about this film, I had really not heard too much specific on it. I knew it was a drug-related film but such detail doesn't tell you how it will approach it – whether it will be Awards-bait 'issues' film, an action movie, or what. In the case of Sciario it is certainly a thriller which uses as its base a world direct from the headlines. The film opens with a tense and violent SWAT incursion, setting a tone that it keeps for the whole film. In place of big action sequences what we get is a slow-burn, where sequences are drawn out, tension, and (if they have violence) tend to have sudden and decisive moments. I have read some complaining that this makes it feel slow paced or dull, however for me it worked really well.Within this thriller, there is a pleasing moral murkiness to it. The viewer is asked to constantly revise who we are supporting and why; and rather than provide us an easy answer at any point, the film leaves us in roundly murky territory, which does feel realistic and satisfyingly bleak. Not all of the film does feel realistic though, and the specifics of the final third are perhaps not in keeping with the tone of the narrative up till that point. Personally I found that the film had done enough to keep me with it so that I went with the narrative when it went off in a specific direction – mainly because it added to the sense of the film being grey morally.The cast are strong throughout, with Blunt, Del Toro, and Brolin, all play their characters well, with a smartness that informs in retrospect as well as in the moment. The supporting cast has plenty of well known faces giving good turns but without distracted by the 'where do I know him from?' factor – specifically Garber, Bernthal, and a brief appearance from Donovan. British Kaluuya is pretty impressive in his role and was a surprise find since I had only before seen him in an episode of Black Mirror. The directing and editing of the film works to the tension, and the camera is used really well to keep the viewer in the scene and feel that tension and feeling of the unknown throughout.Sicario is a strong thriller, which benefits from solid characters, a morally murky narrative, and a consistent brooding tension which is used well to give way to moments of sudden, brutal, and all too believable violence.",Null,4,7,30 December 2015
The Descent," Tense, nihilistic, grim and engaging horror with strong delivery from director, cast and cinematographer (SPOILERS)
","Sarah and her friends Beth and Juno have always enjoyed adventure holidays together, despite Sarah now having a family and a more settled life. A road accident after a white water rafting holiday sees Sarah's family snatched away from her and leaves her in a hospital. A year later Sarah and Beth travel to the US to meet up with Juno and her friends for some caving. Unbeknownst to them, Juno takes them to a series of caves off the beaten track. A rock slide sees the group cut off from their entry point and forced to go deeper into the system to try and find a way out.I have said it many times that I am not a big fan of gore and, that if you get the tone and atmosphere right, I do frighten quite easily. The Descent got good reviews in the UK (perhaps this is to be expected) but I decided to ignore it at the cinema and then again on video. When it was on the selection on a plane journey I decided against it, even though my girlfriend went for it; she spent the majority of the film tensed up and I felt I had made the right decision. When it came on television recently though I decided that enough was enough and went for it (well, I taped it  I mean it was on late at night for goodness sake). Having finally watched it I am glad I did as it is a really strong thriller that delivers atmosphere and tension in spades.Some have said that it is very grim stuff but to me that is part of the appeal. Long-time IMDb reviewer Theo Robertson comments that the lack of charm, humour or warmth is a problem but I have to disagree. On the contrary the nihilistic tone increases the tensions within the narrative and draws the audience into it further  there are no witty one-liners, there are no comedy-relief characters, nothing to allow the audience a space that is safe to breathe. Theo is bang on the money though when he says that those that loved Dog Soldiers will probably prefer it to this (and vice versa) because it does include 'fun' and comedy  making it more of a multiplex horror movie, one that is enjoyable even though it delivers jumps. He is right because I loved The Descent where I only thought Dog Soldiers was OK.When this was released, Neil Marshall appeared unlucky to have made this at the same time as America's The Cave, but in reality his film stands up on its own. Although he needs to light his scenes and not just rely on torches, he embraces the darkness of the caves with relish. The first hour is tense, even though the crawlers do not show up until late into it. This is because Marshall is working on character issues in the background but mostly because he is introducing us to this world of darkness, falls and tunnels. We are already there once the real danger comes and because he has got this tension already working, it doesn't matter whether or not we see the creatures or not  it is the fear of the darkness and the unknown that does it (two very base fears that he plays on expertly). The creatures are really well done as well, the noise and the speed of movement making them scary more than what they do (which is more about the gore). The grim air continues unto the ending, which I consider to be perfectly in keeping with what has gone before. I refer of course to the ending of the 'proper' version and not the 'upbeat' one forced upon some audiences where we close with Sarah having made it out but confronted with a vision(?) of a bloody Juno in the car with her. Instead the proper version sees Sarah mentally collapsed, everyone dead and the sounds all around surely meaning it is a matter of 'when' and not 'if' in regards Sarah going the same way. It is not cheerful of course but if a suitably grim ending and much better than ending it on the car scene.The cast are at times difficult to tell apart and some of them are just random people. Buring has a distinctive character but I did struggle to tell Reid, Mulder and No one apart from the others in the dark. At the head of the cast though are two great performances from Macdonald and Mendoza that are full of fear, fire and hurt. The car accident and the implied infidelity is not pushed to the fore but it is kept around and used to enrich some of the interactions. Macdonald loses it convincingly while Mendoza is a strong counter to her emotion (as well as being stunning). I was engaged by the way the film didn't give us a 'bad guy' in the group and indeed I felt sympathy and dislike for both characters. Of course the main thing the cast have to do is convince within the world of the film and they do this effectively throughout, whether it is a simple rock fall or being hunted for food. Aside from them the majority of the credit belongs to Marshall and cinematographer McCurdy (and you can understand why the latter was sought out for Hills Have Eyes 2) as they deliver a tense atmosphere that really draws the audience in so that you do share the characters fear and urgency.Overall a grim but superior horror film that benefits from the dark style and content. The gore is there if you want it but for me it is the constant sense of fear and nothingness that engaged me, from the first entry into the caves right through to the nihilistic (proper) ending.",Null,13,20,12 December 2007
Inside Man," By not being a straight genre film it manages to strengthen and weaken itself at the same time
","An ordinary day in a major bank, a man dressed as a painter walks in and points torches at the CCTV cameras. Seconds later more people dressed as painters burst in and announce their intentions to all inside. As the hostages are professionally moved into a group and made to dress in the same suits as the robbers, the alarm is raised by a passing cop. For Detective Frazier this is just what he needs to help take his mind off accusations of corruption and girlfriend stress. With a by-the-book hostage situation in front of him things look good but internal and external pressures soon convince him that things are not as straightforward as he first thought.With the trailer offering a great Saturday night, twisty crime thriller, a heavy cast and a strange directorial choice in Lee, this was a film I was hoping would be glossy, slick, silly and fun. However, although I enjoyed it for what it was, I must confess that the lack of consistent direction and pace made it more difficult to get into than I had hoped. It isn't like this at first, with the film jumping right into a very slick taking of the bank and establishing a professional group of thieves to content with. Bringing in Frazier continues this delivery because he has a good swagger to him and it looked like they would pull off this film. You see, things like this need pace and energy and direction  like sharks, they need to keep moving forward or they die; they die by letting the audience question things or move back off the edge of their seat to a vantage point of criticism. With things like Phone Booth, we were never allowed to step back and thus it worked; however here it tries to do other things (to its credit) but these produce an irregular pace, inconsistent tone and tend to take away from the central, gripping action without putting in more than they take out.It still works but it steps away from the robbery too often to touch on other areas. Now these areas could have been a great compliment to the main thread but they don't work as well as they should. The external pressures from Madeline White should have increased the tension in the film but instead they were mostly separate  interesting still but not complimentary. It doesn't help that many of the twists are obvious (certainly the reason for the robbery was obvious  even if it is never actually explained or justified that well) and when the final one does come it is delivered too slowly and reduces its impact. The film is funny and this works quite nicely without slowing things down. The device of the interviews as jumps forward is interesting but unfortunately it tells the audience too much and spoils some of the later action by making it too predictable. Like I said, I still enjoyed it but at times I found myself bothered by the impression that it was a genre movie actively trying not to be a genre movie and only hurting itself in the progress.Visually the film is impressive even if occasionally it felt inappropriate for the material. The movement of the camera, the lush shots of New York, the 'chest-cam' shots and the use of music are all unmistakably Spike Lee and it looks great for it. At times it is a bit obtrusive and almost feels too grand for the material but it is hard to criticise a great director (which is what I personally think Lee is) for having his own style and feel, even if at times he is a fault for reducing the pace and energy of the material. He shows that, although his personal films are more interesting, he can do a good job as director-for-hire as well. The cast are impressive on paper but the delivery means they are not all that good. Foster is a good example, she is a solid presence but her material is weak and half-done and I personally felt she could have been totally removed from the film without any great detriment. Washington is cool in the lead and gives a lively genre performance. The film suggests that he thought he was doing more than just a genre film and there are bits of his character that don't work  his eclectic wardrobe is one but his past and his girlfriend are also threads that don't work that well. Owen is lucky enough to have the best material and despite a so-so accent he does convince and drives the film forward. His motivations and background are annoying question marks but this is not his fault  it is the fault of the delivery that let me question things rather than rushing forward at full speed. Ejiofor is good and works well despite having little to work with. Dafoe is a nice addition but I did feel his material could have been done by someone less famous just as well as he did. Plummer starts the film with such an air of a 'powerful old man with sinister secret' that you never doubt for second where the film is taking him  again not all his fault but he is not used at all well.Despite all my misgivings, the film did do enough to engage me and entertain me on a Saturday night as I suspect it will many viewers. However in the cold light of day the film does have threads that don't work and problems relating to pacing and inconsistency in tone. Funnily enough it is actually the irregular pace that reveals the problems whereas it is had played itself as a straight genre film then it would have covered these with pace and energy. Worth seeing but by not being a straight genre film it manages to be both stronger and weaker at the same time.",Null,29,45,19 March 2006
Hoosiers," Clichéd and mushy - but very enjoyable
","An ex-college basketball coach comes to a small Indiana town to coach the basketball team.  Despite opposition to his methods from the locals he works with the team in his own style - learning lessons about humanity and second chances.  As the season begins so does his work.From the opening scene you know how this film is going to go - a small town basketball team? I wonder if they'll win a major competition despite overwhelming odds?  I wonder......  Basically this is just another US sports movie that gives a nice warm glow that comes from seeing underdogs putting their all into a game.  However it's better than that, the basic set up is a bit clichéd but the characters and the delivery makes it feel better that it is.  The plot however, doesn't really manage to rise out of the usual sports movie clichés - coach with controversial methods, smallest kid on team scoring game winning baskets etc. and is ultimately nothing new.The subplots however do add value to the film.  Dennis Hopper's drunk is a key character and is perhaps the most interesting strand to the film - dealing with second chances, failure and redemption.  Hackman's romance with Hershey is perhaps a little stale and unnecessary but is still quite an interesting addition to the story.  The performances are also good. Hackman, Hershey and Hopper give the whole film a very professional feel, even if Hopper is the only one who's character is not a total genre stereotype.Overall this is a very enjoyable film - yes it's very clichéd and you basically know how things are going to go as soon as the first character says 'we don't like new methods round here', but it's very charming and full of good performances.  The basketball action is well filmed and it does feel like small town high school basketball.  Clichéd but warm and fuzzy!",Null,1,4,11 January 2002
Pulp Fiction," Energetic and imaginative - making up for it's lack of real heart with a great wealth of dialogue and characters
","Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable.",Null,18,41,28 January 2004
Jack Reacher," Solid thriller but needed more edge and to make more of its assets
","I had not only never heard of the source material when this film came out, but I had not even heard that there was such a film until it was suggested I go see it. I declined at the time but recently saw this on a plane. What I found was a perfectly fine thriller which builds nicely from a dramatic opening (made more dramatic for me since I have been on that very spot in Pittsburgh several times) and gradually unfolds to a neat conclusion with several decent set-pieces along the way. That said though, I finished the film with no real desire to see more from this character and with just the basic boxes ticked.Part of the reason for this is Cruise. Talking to others after the film I found that there was controversy because he is apparently smaller than the character in the books but for me there was a much more important disconnect. Simply put Cruise doesn't fit the character he was playing and the dialogue consistently doesn't sound right coming out of his mouth. Cruise is very good at intensity in his characters but here the dialogue and the tone suggest a much more weary man even if he still has plenty of sharpness. The words say 'deliberate' but the performance does not and it was really distracting to see Cruise in front of my eyes when my ears told me to expect someone else. This is not quite as bad but still similar in the action sequences, where he doesn't quite convince either. It is strange and generally I like Cruise for what he does, but here he simply didn't seem to fit.In terms of the rest of the film though it still works. The car chases are good and generally the film has a physical edge to it where it doesn't feel like effects – it feels like metal on metal, not CGI. The plot unfolds pretty well and I was engaged by the story for the most part. The casting beyond Cruise is actually pretty good and it is a shame that more is not made of those they have. Pike is so-so but the film does a good job by having Jenkins, Oyelowo, Courtney, Duvall and of course Herzog in the cast; all of these men do their bits well and the only problem tends to be that they simply are not used often enough. Herzog in particular brings his unique nihilism to his performance and I would have loved to have seen him be menacing more. As it was, the film didn't quite make the most of the cast it had.This is still a solid thriller though, with a decent pace and tone to it. Cruise is badly miscast and, while he still holds the screen, I never felt like I was watching a character so much as watching Cruise say the words of that character. The action is solid and the film is worth a look, but it never threatens to be as good as it could have been.",Null,0,3,8 June 2013
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Those worried about violence being made to look cool should avoid but otherwise it is slick fun without any substance beyond the plot twists and turns
","Eddy has been good with cards since he was a youth but more than that he is good at reading people. So he makes an agreement with friends Bacon, Tom and Soup to raise the cash to enter the £100k game organised by 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale. Unknown to Eddy, Harry cheats and it isn't long before Eddy is in debt to Harry for losses of £500k. With a week to pay, the four friends are desperate but things look good when Eddy overhears of a weed den run by a handful of former public schoolboys who have lots of cash and lots of drugs. However as they try to get it, the web of gangsters and thieves just gets more and more convoluted.Although he has found out that it cannot produce a career. Guy Richie's debut film is a wonderfully fun piece of silliness and style. The success of this film can be seen in the vast number of inferior copies that came out in the years following Lock, Stock's release but although this is not a strong film, it is very energetic and fun. The script is a mix of characters all spouting exaggerated cockney dialogue in a plot that has plenty of twist and turns but very little depth. This isn't really a problem though because most viewers will come to this knowing what to expect  and few of them will be looking for a serious look at gangsters in London. No, this is nonsense but it is cool, funny and (if you ignore what came after) very fresh.For all his inability to work with serious stories, Ritchie knows how to use a camera and this film is full of visual tricks that work really well. Freeze-frames, slow-mo, different shots etc; yes they are all style without substance but the visual feel of the film is cool. The soundtrack is also really good and works well within the film, never hitting a bum note and always lifting the energy anytime any track plays. The plot is well written in regards the funny dialogue and the slick narrative but those who worry about films making violence and crime look cool should probably just avoid it because this is what it does in the place of substance or moral consideration. Of course this doesn't matter because Ritchie and the cast totally buy into the slick, violent comedy that they are making. Flemyng, Fletcher, Moran and Statham all do well in the lead roles  Statham being my favourite because he introduces the film with his cheeky sales pitch. The support cast are all fun even if some of them are unusual choices. Jones doesn't deserve the fame he got off this film but he is solid here even if his range is limited to say the least. Loads of familiar faces fill out the rest of the cast with good caricatures from Blackwood, McLean, Marcus, Flint and others.As we have seen, it has been difficult for Ritchie or anyone else to repeat the success of this film but for his debut he got it spot on. Although it lacks any sense of morals or character substance it is fresh, funny, violent and, most importantly, fun. Not to everyone's taste of course but cool, slick and enjoyable.",Null,6,10,30 October 2006
Les Misérables," Starts strong but doesn't stay as good
","It should be said that while I do enjoy the occasional musical, I'm not really one to seek them out as they tend not to be naturally my thing; indeed my favorite musical is the South Park film, mainly because it manages to have its genre cake and mock it at the same time. So it took me a few minutes to get into the big chorus, singing dialogue thing here but early on I did. To speak of the first hour I had characters I engaged with, songs that mostly are memorable (although the singing is variable) and generally plenty of spectacle and flair in the delivery. The first hour of the film is by far the strongest and it contains a lot of the most emotionally moving aspects.Much has been said about Hathaway and, sort of as a result I wasn't sure how much of it was hype for awards and how much of it was real, but she really is very good throughout her section. The highlight is of course I Dream a Dream, but her whole performance is emotionally charged but yet fragile at the same time. Problem is that with this and other strengths in the first hour, the rest of the film has a lot to live up to and, mostly, it doesn't really manage it. It runs to almost 3 hours and it really does feel long but weirdly at the same time it also feels rushed. It is hard to describe but the amount of story to be told seems too much to really fit in and do it well. As a result it never grabbed me quite as much as it had in that first hour; I still enjoyed it for its flair and spectacle but it felt like that is what I was watching, rather than characters or a story.Beyond Hathaway the cast are not quite as strong. Jackman does well but not amazing; Seyfried is okay while Redmanye, Barks, Tveit and others are solid. Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter both overplay it but are amusing. The only real weak link is Crowe and it is a shame because he actually fits his character very well, it is just the fact that his singing voice is strained that poses a problem â€“ but it is a big problem when you're making a musical. The production values are tremendously high, with great sets, great costumes and around these Hooper gives us some great set-pieces â€“ with the downside of this being that it all seems so surface that it highlights the increasingly lack of much else going on elsewhere.The film still is worth a look for this, but it is a shame that it peaks so early and only seems to slip away from there. It manages to feel overlong while also feeling rushed and needing more time; perhaps me not naturally being drawn to musicals was part of the issue, but it is a flawed but expensive film.",Null,11,18,24 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Tries to do a bit much that doesn't work so well, but the core strengths are there
","The original Guardians of the Galaxy was quite a fresh entry in the crowded world of Marvel. With so many famous characters we at least have heard of, and so many films all crashing into one another with cross-overs, references, solo films, and so on, the arrival of a nostalgia soaked film which had a great sense of humor, fun, and a lack of 'big important things' made for great entertainment. Accordingly it was a big hit, which puts pressure on it as a sequel and (more importantly) as a franchise and part of a bigger product. In short though, it does manage to deliver on the same strengths that the first film had – although that is not the whole story.The second film opens with confirmation of that silly fun – an epic battle against a space monster plays out to the background of Groot dancing, and only becomes the focus to allow for other characters to show themselves again and join the fun. This sense of silly fun, combined with funny dialogue, is the core of the film and it is consistent throughout. Add to that the music, the action, and the overblown nature of it and it is a continuation of the strengths of the first film. There is other content in here too. There are themes of family in 3 different threads, with emotional content between characters and factions. Not all of this works, and it does make it feel a bit heavier than it can bear at times. That said, while it doesn't totally work, it is still well judged since less time on it would have lost a lot in the film, while more time would have tipped the balanced too much in that direction – although these individual moments of the film don't totally sit easily with the humor or pace.The effects and action look good and, while frantic and busy, I didn't find that they overwhelmed with empty noise in the way that can easily happen with these things. The cast are all good when it comes to the comedy elements, although not all so well when the emotional stuff comes around (Saldana/Gillan I thought didn't work so well – although Rooker/Cooper did). Pratt likewise is best when asked to be fun, and less effective when processing a lot about his father. Bautista stands out as the best I think – perhaps because so much of his material was heavily 'fun' focused. The many famous faces in small roles add to the weight of the film (not in a good way), and although they do add value, they also distract and fill out space.Although it does try to do a bit too much, and doesn't stay away from areas where it is weaker, the sequel plays to its strengths enough to please fans of the first film, and to carry it through the moments and aspects which do not work as well as the core.",Null,4,5,26 August 2017
The Da Vinci Code," A roundly ho-hum affair
","Dr Robert Langdon is a historical symbolist from Harvard in Paris to present some of his work when he learns of the murder of friend and colleague Sauniere, curator of the Louvre. Inspector Fache calls Langdon to the scene under the pretence of helping translate the symbols and text that Sauniere left behind him as he died but really he believes the historian is his man. The police cryptologist does not agree though and she helps Langdon flee the scene and so begins a race against time to expose the identity of the killer and the wider quest for the Holy Grail.I'm not a snob but when it comes to books I do so little reading that I am pretty selective about what I read and the massive thriller tombs beloved of long-haul travellers and beach holiday makers generally don't appeal to me. Even with all the fuss and hype over this book I never bothered to check it out and when the film came out, all the fuss just put me off. Now that it has safely reached television it arrives in front of me with so-so reviews, lots of copy-cats and several screenings per day  it takes a better film than this to stand up to such once it is stripped of its marketing campaign.For those caught up in the story then I'm sure that this film will do a sterling job but for me sitting a bit further back from it, the plot is really too contrived and silly to engage. OK, we're not in the realm of the terrible National Treasure 2 here but still I was watching this mostly feeling quite cold and uninterested in the material. Thanks to the budget it looks very good and visually it did make me feel a bit guilty for not being able to take it more seriously but ultimately looks are not enough and the running time is far too long for something so dull that takes itself seriously to the point of being hard to enjoy.Howard's delivery doesn't help too much as it feels like he doesn't want to make it too exciting at any point for fear of taking away from the 'seriousness' of the material. So he and his cinematographer make the European locations and religious imagery all very classy and impressive but yet there is little in the way of entertainment or dramatic value. This is backed up by some surprisingly bland performances  particularly from Hanks. He is too soft and nondescript in the lead and his intellectual apathy was another barrier to me being drawn into the plot. Likewise I didn't think that Tautou managed to find much within the character to work with. Reno floats round in the background, Bettany is so-so while names like Molina, McKellen and Prochnow all fill in round the edges without anyone lifting the film to be better.Overall then this is a very ho-hum affair that failed to engage me even if it was sporadically interesting. The delivery is too serious and plodding considering how silly the vast majority of the plot was and ultimately I didn't find the film to be much cop in regards drama, action, acting or anything really.",Null,5,11,28 May 2008
Titanic," Lacks convincing dialogue, performances and narrative leaving the CGI, which is impressive but is dating already
","Rose DeWitt Bukater is a beautiful young woman, travelling to America to be married to the dashing cad that is Caledon Hockley. Jack Dawson is a poor Irish kid with little hope of getting to the land of plenty  until, that is, he wins tickets onto a ship making that very crossing in mere minutes. Jack and his friend rush onto the boat and find themselves in 3rd class with all the rest of the poor people. Meanwhile, on the upper decks, the rich enjoy the space and pleasure that comes with privilege but yet Rose feels little happiness about her loveless prospects. A chance meeting between Jack and Rose sees them fall into a passionate instant love affair but time will show them that the class divide between them is really the least of their concerns.As others have mentioned, Titanic seems to have enjoyed great praise and great abuse. When it came out it was the biggest movie of the day, sitting at the top of the charts for months and also sweeping the Best Picture Academy Award for that year. However as time has gone on it has received more and more of a kicking from viewers and it has now lost a lot of the appeal and shine that it once had. To some this is just a simple backlash without basis but I'm not sure I agreed with that. Of course there is an element of wanting to tear down the 'success' of the film and perhaps wipe that smug smile off James 'king of the world' Cameron's face but for me a lot of the negativity comes from people seeing the film in the cold light of day, without the crowded cinema, without the hype, without the partner to hug up to while watching.So it is with me here. The first time I watched it I was with my partner in the front room of a packed cinema and allowed myself to be carried along by the sheer spectacle and not worry too much about the finer points. However watching it again I viewed it like I would any other film. As such the failings came tumbling out. The story is consistently weak whether it is the speed and superficiality of the central 'relationship' or the roundly average dialogue within the script. Funny how a rush to sex is seen as romantic when it occurs in the movie whereas if the same tale was set in a Bolton nightclub, the view would not be the same! Part of the reason for this is the forced emotion and atmosphere of the film, with James Horner's manipulative score constantly on hand to tell us 'you're meant to cry at this bit'. This is very different from bringing the audience into the characters and the story in a genuine way and you are not getting into this car because you want to so much as being forced in with a hood over your head.Of course this is not so different from many Hollywood blockbuster, but it is particularly noticeable here because the script and characters are so lacking. Director Cameron cannot make up for the failings of writer Cameron and instead just injects as much of this manipulative schmaltz into proceedings as he can as he waits for his effects budget to kick in. When it eventually does there is no denying that it is impressive in terms of spectacle but I do wonder how this will hold up as the effects become ordinary, because there is little else for the viewer to feast on. Certainly the performances offer very little, mostly due to the material handed to them. DiCaprio is miscast. I know it has been said countless times before but he looks far too young for the part and, as he looks more adult in other films he looks younger and younger in retrospect. Both he and Winslet are capable of so much more but neither really work individually or as a couple. Zane hams it up as a 'baddie' and actually seems to be having a good time of it unlike his co-stars. Bates, Fisher, Paxton, Warner, Amis, Hyde and others all fill round the edges with so-so performances.There is no questioning that this was a massive success and will stand up in lists for years to come. However the effects are already dating and, them to one side, there isn't a huge amount else to spend three hours on. The love story is clunky to match the dialogue and the actors can do little with it producing an unconvincing love story that is forced out with manipulative and exploitative methods that are exposed as such with a clear eyed viewing. A big film but not really a good one.",Null,40,157,14 October 2007
Rocky III," Clever switch on the first two films but still is a boxing soap opera
","Years after defeating Apollo Creed, Rocky has successfully defended his title 10 times and is living well off commercials, endorsements and his charitable public image.  However just off Rocky's radar, a hungry young fighter, Clubber Lang,  is winning fight after fight by knock out.  Sickened after a charity fight where Rocky takes on a wrestler in a comedy display, Lang challenges Rocky to a fight.  Rocky loses his title during the bout and suffers a personal loss.  With the help of Apollo Creed, Rocky seeks to get his hungry desire back and retake his title from Lang.Stallone shows that he can write soap opera easily and quite intelligently. Here the Rocky story is put on it's head and we see him growing old and successful.  He is not as urgent and hungry for victory as he once was. This twist makes this more enjoyable than the second film as we get to see what happens to successes when they forget where they came from.  In many ways this reflects what must have been going on in Stallone's head as his movie career progressed.  It may not be a perfect comparison but it is more interesting than another copy.The soapy mush of the first two is toned down a bit here and replaced by the struggle to re-find the fire that made Rocky so strong.  This way we get to know Rocky better and this journey is more interesting when he has to go back to go forward.  At times the story is silly and the fight scenes aren't as good as the previous tow films, although the final fight still carries an emotional, if unrealistic, punch.Stallone is good, as he seems to bring a lot of himself to the role this time  his experiences have changed as have Rocky's, he uses that.  Shire's character has changed well and Young's character is more interesting than before.  Mr T is good, at first he is sympathetic because he is the contender, however to make Rocky more popular he has to be really arrogant towards the end.  Hulk Hogan makes a silly cameo that goes on to long and Burgess Meredith just seems to be getting more grouchy and wrinkled by the second.Overall this is good  better than the second.  The interest is renewed by the switch in Rocky from underdog to rich success pursued by young contenders.  The mushy emotion is toned down and the good elements from the first two films are talked up.  Solid.",Null,1,5,27 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good but too long and with few strong characters
","Dropped with his aunt and uncle as a baby, Harry grows up in a loveless home and is made to sleep under the stairs.  On his 11th birthday Harry learns the truth of his past when he is visited by Rubeus Hagrid and invited to attend Hogwart's school for wizards and witches.  Whilst learning his craft Harry and his friends notice some strange things and begin to investigate, leading them deeper into a mystery that involves a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents and a quest for a powerful stone that brings immortality.I had no strong desires to see this film.  I have not read any of the books, nor do I have any plans to as they just don't interest me.  Back in my family home one week I noticed they had bought a copy of this film on VHS and I decided to give it a watch.  I knew little of the plot but it carried me along well enough.  It did seem a little long and that the film was trying to cram as many effects scenes as possible where it should really have been developing characters instead.  Don't get me wrong the effects are all good and hold the interest well, but without the characters I felt like I didn't care very much about the plot.I know this is a children's film so characters aren't that important but that leads me to another point  the running time.  At over two hours I struggled to care enough to sustain my interest.  I don't have kids but I did wonder how many would be able to focus for that long  but I suppose that the reason for throwing in an effects scene every five minutes just to wake them up!The cast is crammed with talent  most of which it fails to make good use of.  In the lead Radcliffe is quite bland and didn't do too much with his role.  Happily Grint and Watson who both are funny and have good characters  even if they are only sidekicks in the film, supported him.  It is telling that recent publicity for the second film has put these two on a par with Harry  even giving them their own posters.  Of the support cast only Coltrane is well used, everyone else just has cameos of one sort or another. Hart, Cleese, Harris, Rickman, Smith etc all have only a few scenes at most and (in the case of Rickman and Cleese) a few lines at most.  This is annoying on two levels.  Firstly, the fact that such talent is wasted and secondly the fact that none of them are allowed characters  only a chance to show their face briefly once or twice.Overall it was enjoyable and will please kids even if only for the regular effects scenes.  It has flaws and it is clearly aimed at those who have Potter fever already.  N the strength of this I will not be going to see the second film until someone gives it to me to watch.  It's a good film but it feels like it is made to see Happy Meals and start a franchise than to be a good film in it's own right. (as a side note  I find it hilarious that it had to be renamed for the USA as the studio felt that the word `philosopher' would confuse American audiences who didn't know what it meant!)",Null,8,17,30 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Enjoyably dark entry in the series that counteracts the long running time with a good (and consistent) pace and exciting set pieces
","Despite strange and violent appearances during the Quidditch World Cup, Hogwarths are selected to host the Legendary Triwizard Tournament. Three representatives are to be selected from the magical goblet of fire, but students under the age of 17 are barred from being put forward. So three are picked but a fourth name is brought out of the cup  that of Harry Potter. Claiming he never put it in or even wanted to take part, Harry is told that rules are rules and that he must take part in the dangerous tasks. Meanwhile, aside from the tasks, a dark force continues to grow around Hogwarths; one that has a Having quite enjoyed the darker tone of the last film, I did want to take a look at this one despite not caring about the books or being that impressed with the film series in truth. However, due to my experience in the cinema last time (what idiots think that 4 year old kids will be able to sit still in a cinema for almost 3 hours?) I decided to get it on video this time. Although I was a bit unsure as to the relevance of the opening Quidditch scene (it just seemed to jump right into it then move on) it did mark the start to what was an enjoyably dark film with a good pace and enough substance to hold my interest. The story is a rather long winded way of getting us closer to the conclusion of the story and, I suppose, looking back on the narrative it does play like just a load of set pieces with the elephant constantly stood in the dark corner of the room. That said though, the script has enough to it to be more than just a load of noise, with sufficient story in it to stand as a solid tale as well as a link in a series.The dark tone will be too much for some younger viewers, although personally I don't think a bit of darkness will hurt them in the longterm. However my advice would be to not take a young child to the cinema  you'll spoil it for everyone else. The effects are impressive without being the whole show  in other words, during the dragon scene I was into the excitement of the scene rather than just staring at the effects. Newell's direction is part of this as he gives the whole film a feeling of foreboding doom, a feeling greatly helped by the grim but attractive cinematography and wonderful attention to detail in sets and costumes.The cast is full of famous faces but it feels a bit more focused than earlier films. Radcliffe is good value for the vast majority of the film and it is only really when the script asks him to dig deeper that he is exposed and found wanting (you'll know the scene I mean). Grint and Watson have a bit more to them than in the last films  still very much support characters but interesting in their own rights. Gleeson makes a menacing addition to the cast and hams it up just enough without doing it too much. Tennant is good in a side role, although he is a bit hard to view with the Dr Who hindsight. The rest of the cast all turn in good performances in very small parts without making the film feel cluttered (although it is hard to always accept that some famous people do very little). Rickman is a case in point but he is a nice presence, as are Williams, Sykes (!), Spall, Coltrane, Gambon, Davis, de la Tour (!), Smith, Oldman and a few others.Overall then, this is an enjoyable film that benefits from a solid story, dark and mean content and generally good performances. It probably isn't suitable for the same age group that the first films were, but it is a better all round film for it. Hopefully the later films can keep this dark, mean tone while continuing to deepen and strength the story and characters.",Null,1,6,19 April 2006
In Time," Standard chase thriller that isn't that well done and doesn't seem interested in its own message
","In Time starts strong. The idea here is that time literally is money as it has become the currency of the world – those that make time (the rich) can in theory life forever as they have loads of time on their hands (literally as the clocks are embedded on their wrists); by contrast the poor life day to day, working to keep time on their clocks for as long as possible. As an allegory for money and the contrast between rich and poor in our world, it is a clever one and it offered the potential for quite a smart piece of sci-fi – I was hoping that it could keep the 'ideas' coming while delivering an enjoyable thriller as well.Unfortunately it doesn't really do either of these things and while i hoped it would get cleverer and more engaging as it played out, the reality was that it did the opposite – getting sillier, less thrilling and less interested in the ideas it had originally. Early on we have plenty of good things – the death of a character is impacting and little things like rich people doing nothing at speed etc are clever observations within this world. However, once Will goes on the run with Slyvia the film takes a dramatic downward turn. Funnily enough this section of the film also marks a low point for special effects too as it features a car crash which is done with hilariously bad model-work. At this point the film becomes some sort of Bonnie & Clyde thriller and it suddenly loses interest in many of the things it had been doing well up till that point.In terms of the thriller content, this means that the air of desperation and the air of vulnerability that was in the film early on just evaporates and suddenly Will is an action hero who cannot be stopped. It is a shame because without this atmosphere a lot of the action is exposed for what it is – rather silly and basic. Harder for me to take though is that the film loses interest in the message it is delivering – what we have here is basically a film rallying against the world of capitalism and stating that it is only fair that those with the time share it fairly among those without rather than hoarding more than they need. A fairly brave message but by the time we get to that at the end, the film doesn't seem to be convincing even itself and it seems more interested in getting cool shots of our characters with guns and creating false dramatic moments of running and clock-beating. It is a real shame that the intelligence went out of it – and the lack of strong thrills and ideas means that you end up thinking about other things in this world and picking holes in them.The cast list is young but decent. Timberlake gave me pause but he is actually pretty good and it is a shame that the second half of the film gives him nothing to do. Seyfield is oddly pretty but her character makes less than no sense and she cannot sell it to herself far less us. Murphy is always watchable and his presence deserves more than he got – in particular his final scene in the film is poorly done. The supporting cast is an odd mix of TV faces that you'll recognise from things like House, Mad Men and White Collar – none of them bad, but like the main players, the material isn't there for them in most cases.A good one-line idea of a film then. I was hoping it could be thrilling and smart but in the end it wasn't really either as it descends into a Bonnie & Clyde scenario that doesn't make much sense and doesn't play out convincingly. While it does this it also stops caring about the message it is rolling out – by the end it seems like the ideas in the script are just an inconvenience getting in the way of the simple thriller the film is trying to focus on.

Thor," Distracting spectacle but disappointingly empty of ideas and full of franchise 'stuff' (mild SPOILERS)
","I had heard a lot of good things about this film before I eventually saw it. I had decided that I wasn't going to go and pay loads of money to sit in noisy cinemas and be bombarded with disappointing blockbusters this summer, but I figured that this had enough good word of mouth to be worth seeing. After watching it I browsed through the user comments here of writers I generally trust and found that most of them had loved it too; so why did I find it to be all a lot of fuss and nonsense that ultimately amounts to very little?I came to Thor with some worries despite the good word of mouth, I never cared for the character generally and he always seemed a little silly to me, with the Nordic god dialogue just making it worse. As a result I guess the script could have been worse because it would have been bogged down in this stuff but it never was, however this is not to say that it worked well. What it does is take us from point A to point B without ever really doing a huge amount of interest. It has enough humour in to stop it being too serious, but not enough to actually be light and fun. It has enough character in it to avoid it feeling wooden, but not enough to make one care. It has enough drama in it to set up the action, but not enough to provide actual tension or a sense of danger. To me it didn't seem to do anything in particular. I was looking for more sport to be made of this silly God once he was on earth but it didn't happen. In particular I was looking for Loki to be a more interesting 'baddie' since he could have been a tragic, haunted character – but we don't see this outside of his actions.This all came together for me to limit my interest in what was going on. The stuff in the heavens was all too full of mock Shakespearean shouting but without dramatic substance, while the stuff on Earth was too fleeting and lacking fun and entertainment value. For sure the film provides spectacle but again I just found it to be rather hollow as I watched it, enjoying it for the noise but not much else. The cast are varied. Although limited, Hemsworth is well-cast because he has the body and big voice to fill the character. He needed a good opposite number though and in Hiddleston he doesn't have it – he doesn't have the presence needed or the depth of character. Portman has almost nothing to do and it shows in her performance, she is here for the sake of it and you could have digitally removed her from this film and made no difference to it. Ditto Skarsgård– at least Dennings provided some light relief. Hopkins adds a bit of gravitas to proceedings, while Elba has the frame and voice for his character. Like everyone else it surprises me still to think this was directed by Kenneth Branagh, but it is a smart career move for him to show he can do big budget effects movies – if it does nothing else, it shows that.Thor feels like a film that had to be made rather than one that was created on its own merits. Of course, as part of The Avengers, this is true but it is irritating that you feel that way while watching it. It has noise and spectacle for those looking for that, but it lacks too much in the way of character, danger, humour and good old fashioned entertainment. You know when you buy a new product and the first few days it is shiny and great but then, in using it you spot lots of gaps and think 'why didn't they do this?' and 'why did they not expand this function?' – well Thor is that product, shiny and noisy but ultimately one is left wondering why the makers didn't do a lot more in some regards and a lot less in others. Not an awful film – but just a bog-standard one with a massive effects budget.",Null,33,61,21 September 2011
The Happening," Shyamalan's stock drops further with a film that lacks tension, characters, good dialogue, drama, urgency or intelligence (SPOILERS)
","It is a normal day in Central Park whenever people start talking strangely, moving awkwardly and inflicting fatal injury on themselves. With the media buzzing with talk of terrorist attacks, mass evacuation of the central New York area is organised. Among those fleeing is teacher Elliot Moore, along with his wife and a few others. The theory is that the municipal areas are the targets but somehow the attacks continue in smaller areas all along the East Coast. Seeking refuge further and further from population centres, Elliot tries to work out what is happening  if only to stay alive.It didn't help that I watched this film shortly after watching the much better The Mist, which has the same sort of theme in regards an unknown and deadly disaster. Seeing something hitting the mark highlighted for me just how badly short of the mark this most recent M. Night Shyamalan film is. Of course it didn't really need another film to highlight the problems because they are all up there to be seen by all viewers. The opening scene drops us into the middle of a disaster starting out in New York where suddenly people are killing themselves, jumping off roofs and so on and it does grab you that something big is happening. Problem is, it has nowhere to go from there apart from delivering a clumsy and obvious environmental rant that makes little sense or impact. The film tries to make things personal and tense by focusing on a small group of characters but it doesn't work and the visual effect of the wind (like Kermode said  'who's making it blow?') just doesn't work and you never once feel genuine fear or urgency.It doesn't help that the script is full of terrible dialogue and has no room or apparent need to have characters that the audience can care about. Many others have highlighted the terrible performances but in fairness with these lines and this direction, how could they have been much better? I say this as someone who likes Wahlberg in films that suit him but here he is clunky and unconvincing, totally hampered by the material handed to him. Deschanel spends most of the time gawking and offers nothing of interest while at least Leguizamo has the good fortune to get out early on  but even this is a surprisingly emotionless event. The fault for all of this must rest with Shyamalan himself because he has turned a mass disaster into a dull and lifeless affair; the good things he has done (Unbreakable and Sixth Sense) are slipping further back in time and if his plan is to fill his resume with stuff like this then I wonder how long he can continue to have the career he would like.The Happening is a good idea but it falls down badly when it comes to the delivery. It lacks tension, urgency, character, drama, dialogue and intelligence and, one way or another all of these problems can fairly be laid at the door of Shyamalan. A roundly poor film despite the potential.",Null,19,32,13 July 2008
Castle in the Sky," A visually impressive and engaging adventure with a solid narrative, characters and voice-work  great fun
","When the airship she is on is attacked, Sheeta tries to escape from her would-be captors but falls to her death through the clouds. Fortunately the enchanted and mysterious crystal she is wearing round her neck saves her and floats her to the ground where she is found by young Pazu, who is rushing to get back to his boss in the mine with food. Pazu takes her in and they become friends but quickly learn that the pirates after Sheeta have not given up their chase. Not only do the pair have to deal with the pirates but also the government, led by sinister agent Muska, have their own dark reasons for getting hold of Sheeta. Escaping Pazu's town together is only the start of their adventure together.Hard to believe that this film is twenty years old and yet looks as fresh and is as engaging as anything else you will see today. The sheer visual style and imagination is quite breath-taking and I could not quite believe that this was made by Miyazaki only 7 years after the vastly inferior (but still OK) Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro (or The Castle of Cagliostro as it was in the UK). As writer he has also done well to craft a story that is engaging and enjoyable. It struggles at times with the weight of coincidence needed to make the film move forward but the manner of delivery covers up these little problems by producing regular action and fun characters. The pace of the film is perfectly pitched and things move forward really well and I can't imagine an audience of children or adults will be bothered by the running time. The characters bring out nice relationships as well which adds value to the story but unfortunately points made late in the film about the environment and such are heavily made and clunky.The voice cast in the English dub are mostly very good. Sadly the weakest link is Paquin, she sounds unnatural and a little wooden too often. She probably isn't that weak but she is shown up by an engagingly fresh and natural delivery from Van Der Beek  not something I expected to be saying when I learnt he was doing the voice of Pazu. Just as good is Leachman's Dola  blessed with a good character in the first place, her voice is spot on despite sounding a little like Mrs Skinner on the Simpsons. Hamill takes the bad guy role well and shows his experience at animation even if he is a little hammy at the odd point. Everyone works well together and they deliver their characters well to support the narrative and they match the impressive visuals well.Overall this may not have the emotional depth of Spirited Away but it has strong characters and good relationships. These are grown within a engaging story told with pace and a good rate of action. Of course if none of this interests you then it is still worth seeing for Miyazaki's imagination and style, which is impressive and hard to believe that it is 20 years old this year.",Null,7,7,3 September 2006
The Untouchables," A classic crime thriller
","The story is one of legend: Al Capone prohibition era reign is brought down by crusading Treasury agent Elliot Ness. What makes this better than any other version? Many factors. Firstly the director is one of the greats (when he's on target). De Palma has his weaknesses but he is technically proficient and excellent at creating tension in set pieces. Here he creates a spirit of adventure in the character of Ness but also delivers several very tense scenes where the action is slowly built up to.Secondly the story is strong enough to keep the interest throughout - you know the story but the style of telling is slick and the characters draw you in. It is a fascinating tale of the times, even when it has been fictionalised like this.The main factor looking back is the strength of the cast from top to bottom. Costner (before his career imploded) is excellent as Ness, the righteous man pushed over the limits of his morality in his quest to do right, and shows the internal struggle going on inside well. De Niro enjoys himself as the unpredictable Capone and many of his scenes here have become part of everyone's knowledge (the baseball bat!). Garcia and Martin Smith do well in support while Connery is strong as Jim Malone, the Irish (!) beat cop who becomes Ness's mentor. I'm not sure the Oscar was totally deserved but it's still a good performance.",Null,0,7,29 October 2001
The Godfather: Part III," Not as bad as everyone says  but suffers from the pressure of the first two
","Michael Corleone has sold his illegal business in an attempt to win back his family.  However he must still contend with up and coming mobsters such as Vincent, who wants to work for him and Joey Zasa, who wants to fully take over the Corleone family's territory.  When the Corleone family begin to deal with the Vatican and plan to buy out their share of an multinational corporation he finds that the Vatican is just as corrupt as his illegal operations were.  Despite his best efforts he finds himself sucked back into the world he has tried to leave behind.Easily one of the most hated films ever made  or at least you'd think it was by the critical mauling it got for a raft of reasons.  However watching it now it isn't that bad and really it only suffers from comparison with the two films before it.  But lets be fair, Coppola has made 3 or 4 of the best films ever made  did we really expect another one from him?The film has a reasonable plot and brings the trilogy to a logical end.  The plot however does have it's weaknesses  for example it starts well with Michael's attempt to `get out' being hampered by other families on their way up.  But when it starts to get involved with money laundering through the Vatican and the corruption therein, it starts to lose it's way and it's focus on Michael.The main weakness comes in the characters.  Would Michael really go straight just to get his family back  and how come he managed to do it so easily up till the time of the film?  Worse still is Connie who seems to have become some sort of Mafia widow when that was not part of her character in the previous films  would she really have got that twisted or influential? Little problems like these just bugged me and they also fed into the performances.For such a great cast the acting was very average.  Pacino is good but I sensed he didn't see Michael turning out this way and he didn't convince occasionally.  Keaton has little to do and again I felt that her approach to Michael was too forgiving, although maybe I'm not allowing for time.  As I Siad before Shire was doing some sort of `Bride of Frankenstein' act as Connie and I didn't buy it for a moment.  Garcia was OK and faces like Wallach, Hamilton and the like helped.  The two worst performances were sadly two of the main ones.  First Joe Mantegna..now it wasn't that it was bad  it was more that I've seen him do so much better.  Here all I could think of when I watched him was how his character and his acting was very like his Simpsons' character of ` Fat Tony'.  Bare in mind Fat Tony is meant to be a spoof of the Mafioso characters and you'll see why I didn't like it.The worse performance was Sofia Coppola.  Now she was vilified at the time for her role  a bit unfairly and cruelly but she was still bad.  She has this strange scowl on her face for most of the film and she acts like a spoil little girl.  She also has no realism in her voice and speaks in the same constant tone  that Vincent would fall for her was just a leap of faith too far to accept.  The cast does have others who are unused or underused  Fonda being the best example.  Why did she bother with that role!?Overall, this is miles behind the other two Godfathers and it has plenty of weaknesses.  However at it's heart it's a good try as the concluding part and the story is watchable.  It's not bad, it just is average and it feels like the director and large sections of the cast felt they just had to turn up to make a third classic film.",Null,129,178,25 July 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Good but the heavy plot and Shakespearean tone makes it more difficult for itself
","News reaches Zion of an army of sentinels amassing on the surface many miles above the city, clearly preparing for an invasion. While the city prepares for a counter attack on the sentinels, Morpheus pins his hopes on Neo and obeys orders to stay with broadcast range to allow Neo to meet with the Oracle. Neo meanwhile is plagued with dreams of Trinty's death in the matrix. When the Oracle does contact Neo, she tells him of The KeyMaker - the man who can get him access to the very source of the matrix. A rescue mission is mounted which is complicated by not only the agents, but rogue programmes and the return of a 'freed' Agent Smith.Many reviews (here and in the press) have tended to go one way or the other. Some have lavished praise on this film claiming it as a milestone and even better than the original, others have hated it and laid into it heavily. I'm not wanting to sit on the fence but I do feel that both camps have valid points and that the answer is somewhere in the middle. The main reason I found it hard to get into this film was the heavy tone it has now developed. Seemingly the same bug that the Star Wars movies have caught (taking themselves too seriously) the matrix appears in danger of getting in a bad way. The plot here is quite straightforward and not as twisty as the original - however it is delivered as if every line of dialogue was profound. This really sucks the life out of the film as it is not profound but rather borders on the pretentious at times due to it's delivery.I suspect that this was spotted and so the film is unnecessarily cluttered with minor characters that detract from the central tale. And so screen time is given to Link and his wife as well as a seemingly pointless speech from Merovingian. This makes it feel baggy and also slightly unsatisfactory when these strands appear to go nowhere but only fill time. Also the plot is a little too complex (all this rogue programme stuff) and isn't delivered in a user friendly way - it is not always clear what the significance of certain things are until later in the film and even then it is uneven. However both these criticisms will be countered if, in Revolutions, these strands are brought together and minor characters in Reloaded are shown to have a bigger input.On the plus side the action is very good. I must admit that it wasn't as exciting as the original mainly because the plot wasn't as involving to me - I need a good story generally to get into the action side. However in honesty the action still looks great and is a real leap forward from the Matrix - a great blend of wire work and visual effects. Occasionally the special effects are slightly wanting (in Neo's fight with Agent Smiths it is clear when it is a visual effect rather than the real thing) but these are minor quibbles compared to some sterling work. The car chase on the freeway may be a very easy way to get an action scene but it still works very well and is exciting. The only downside to it is that I felt that an action scene should have been part of the end of the film - instead the 'big' scene occurs a good 20 minutes before the end of the film. The actual cliff-hanger itself doesn't really work and it could have done better with a general downbeat ending like Empire Strikes back had - did it think I needed a reason to watch part 3? I'm already there!The acting suffers from the same problems as the plot - it is all too heavy. The clearest way this is seen is in Fishburne. In part 1 he was very good, especially when he exposed Neo to the matrix with a mix of playful wit and serious touches when they were needed. Here in part 2 he seems to be mistaken that he is playing Othello again. Watch him speaking to the crowds at Zion, he really plays it like he is playing Moses or something. In fact all through the film he is very heavy - even compare his big fight with his previous face-off with Smith in part 1, there he was human and vulnerable here he is more like a rock and less fun for it. Moss is also serious but she was in part 1 too so it's not so noticeable. Reeves is good and at least adds some humour but he plays it very serious again. The additions add colour but are mostly distractions. The support cast in part 1 were merely there, here the film feels it has to develop them to make a rich tapestry but the end result is it feeling too stretched. It's hard not to watch Pinkett-Smith and feel that her character is more to do with the video game than the film itself. Happily Hugo Weaving is fun and is back with his old sneer, while the twins are good value despite having minimal plot impact.Overall it was always going to be hard to follow up the first film. There the plot was gripping and it is difficult to make the growth of Neo's powers as interesting as his discovery of them was. I enjoyed the film but just felt that the almost biblical significance that it tries to give itself was it's undoing - luckily the action and style was it's salvation. Hopefully I will watch Revolutions and see how Reloaded works better in hindsight. Without that knowledge, many of the plot strands appear to be left loose. If I watched this as a film by itself then it would be irritating - if the conclusion to the trilogy can get back to the enjoyment and tone and spectacle of the matrix at it's best then this will be a much better film in company of it's brothers. Far from perfect but I don't see how anyone can totally write this film off.",Null,163,207,2 June 2003
The Fountain," Visually and thematically impressive and touching  trying to attribute a narrative context to all of it will be missing the point
","Tomas searches Mayan country, seeking the legendary tree of eternal life that offers him the chance to free his captive queen. A medical researcher pushes the bounds of professional ethics as he attempts to extract a natural cure for his dying wife. A traveller in deep space attempts to make it to a dying star wrapped within a nebula in order to spend eternity with his destined love.The Fountain got mixed reviews when it came out for a short cinema run in the UK. Perhaps understandably because, although he is hailed by some, he is dismissed by others. So far my experiences have seen me fall into the middle ground as Pi didn't totally win me over the way it did others but I did find Requiem for a Dream to be as impressive as I had heard. So I came to the Fountain unsure of what I would find and not sure if I would like it or if I would struggle with how impenetrable the ploy summaries and comments did make it sound. At first glance it does seem this way because the link between the three stories (and the nature of at least two of the them) does make it seem like a concept to be cracked and pieced together. I do think coming at it like this will only lead to frustration. It is my belief that the modern section is real and that the other two exist within the book  this explanation helped me as it allowed me to focus on the emotion and themes within these sections rather than trying figure out the exact narrative reason for a bald man inside a spaceship that looks like a bubble.By doing this I was left with a film that I found interesting from start to finish, with the theme of movement from life to death and perhaps rebirth being one that was explored visually as much as it was in the material. To say it like this does run the risk of making it sound corny but rather, with this approach, it does work really well, layering ideas and themes to awesome effect. The central relationship holds the film together and, although some have criticised the other two threads as weaker, I personally saw them as being as much of the main thread as the main scenes were themselves. I was surprised by how touched I was at points and found myself watching a sci-fi with an intense human story running throughout it (or vice versa  I'm not sure).Some have said that Aronofsky's style as director is a bit cold and distant from his subjects. Technically I agree with that, which is why the performances are all the more important here. While the camera may not be about the heart, the performances must be and accordingly we get a pair of tremendous performances from the two stars. Jackman dominates the film. It must have been difficult to find his character in the midst of so many effects and concepts but he does it and, while you can see a lot of effort is being put in technically in some scenes, he never loses the focus on what he is trying to do. Weisz has less time and less of the material but she does almost as well  really connecting with Jackman and making her acceptance of transition seem convincing  something I saw as key in the delivery. Burstyn has a small role, while famous faces such as Thomas, Margolis, Curtis and Suplee provide solid turns even if their time is limited.Although he is cold as a director there is no doubting that Aronofsky is a skilled director with a great creative force. His control of the theme across the film sees Libatique producing a wonderful control of light that I cannot even begin to comprehend how he created what he wanted and managed to capture it on film. The space sequences will catch the eye most but I was just as impressed with the use of light in the present-day scenes as the use of distant light, being just out of the light etc was an excellent visual extension of the theme.As I expected, on the surface of it this is not an easy film to crack and, although not inaccessible, it is understandable why it didn't rip in a massive mainstream audience. However at its core it is a simple and touching tale, that is cleverly expanded thematically across the bookend threads. While the director and talented crew seem to focus on the technical delivery of the themes, they are matched with a masterful turn from Jackman  meaning that the emotion is right there the whole time, holding us in a story that is inventive and technically impressive as much as it is human.",Null,14,20,18 July 2007
Mystic River," Solid film, a little unsure of it's direction at times but reassuringly bleak
","As children Jimmy, Dave and Sean are all close friends until one day where Dave is abducted by men pretending to be the police.  He escapes after days of abuse but is scarred for life.  Years later he has married but is still a little mixed up, Jimmy is an ex-con and Sean is a police officer.  When Jimmy's daughter is found murdered, he seeks revenge  whether it be through his own route or Sean's police work.  The three old friends are brought back together in a variety of ways.I had heard mixed things about this film before I saw it but I wanted to see it on the strength of the cast and the director's names.  The plot starts with a horrid scene of abduction which, while far from graphic, has a sense of foreboding about it that is very unnerving.  After this the film jumps forward and we are led into a detective story that touches on the past and how it affects our lives today.  The connections are sometimes very poorly delivered  for example the whole affair relating to Sean's wife is just out there and never really understood in the context of the film.  Likewise a lot of the other connections seem to be an afterthought to the main detective story  I haven't read the book but I got the impression a lot of it had been crammed into a short time with mixed results.The end of the film itself exposes the uncertainty the themes are mixed. Jimmy's wife's speech is confusing in it's intent, Sean's reaction (both the happy conversation and `finger gun' gesture) is inexplicable  the ending seems to wipe clean the lives of these two characters, although the regret and loss of Dave's wife is shattering in how it is portrayed.  Where the film is strongest is in the characters  they keep the story moving and are a good mix of personalities.  Sean is the least well explained but is still a good solid character when you ignore his subplot.Bacon is sort of the main character of the three as he drives the investigation, he is given good support by Fishburne  who I was able to stop seeing as Morpheus after about 5 minutes.  Penn is a great actor but he isn't a great fan of `everything in moderation' and he gets very hammy at times.  At one point in the film he is surrounded by a group of policemen and howling at the moon with grief  if you get the dvd and freezeframe it you can clearly see that Penn's shirt cufflinks are actual bits of bacon because he is just a big slice of ham!  For the majority of the film he is actually very good, but at key moments he steps up way too much.  Much better due to his underplaying, is Robbins.  His character is much more difficult and I suspect that the least he will receive for this is a nomination for best supporting actor.  Of the women, Harden stands out. Although her character is a little hard to grasp in terms of motivation, her performance is powerful.  Linney is good but has less to do until near the end.The direction is very solid  full of majestic sweeps and nice shots.  The music is a little overwrought; as if the film needed the music to do the emotional work for it.  The one thing that bothered me is that Eastwood clearly sees this as his next Oscar  he has a worthy, depressing film and fills it with worthy/grand shots with the intent of being worthy enough for the Oscar.  I did get the feeling that his heart was as much into getting the Oscar as it was in making a film for it's own sake.Overall this is a quality film, but it is a flawed quality film.  It aspires to much  but much of what it wants is just outside of it's grasp.  It is worth seeing as a film driven by good characters painted large by very good actors.",Null,43,71,28 October 2003
Zombieland," Not as hilarious or brilliant as many say but consistently amusing and entertaining (SPOILERS)
","The basic setup for this film sees us in familiar territory with a handful of survivors left in the middle of a world full of zombies since patient zero took their first bite out of a human, spreading the disease rapidly and totally. Young loner and geek Columbus has survived thanks to his strict rules of engagement and survival. On the road he meets and joins up with another survivor, Tallahassee, who is alive thanks to his inherent ability to kick ass and kill zombies. He also has a specific quirk as he is not so much looking for a way to rebuild humanity as he is looking for any surviving stocks of Twinky bars. The two meet two sisters during one such search but find that the zombies are only one of their problems.So far, so standard but Zombieland stands out in a very crowded genre by being consistently amusing and occasionally very funny indeed. The tone of the film has been compared to Shaun of the Dead by everyone and their dog so I suppose I should join them by agreeing to a point because at points it does have some very imaginative and rapid-fire gags (sight and dialogue based). However I don't think it is quite as good as it doesn't quite manage to spread the laughs consistently – yes it manages to amuse consistently and for me that was enough but the bigger laughs tended to remind me that they were not as frequent as I would have liked. The plot is written to fit with the film as a comedy but at times it does slightly irritate because of how illogical the whole thing is – having some of the silly aspects is fine but even within the internal logic of the film the fairground just doesn't make any sense at all.Of course it is just a silly film and this is what it is best to enjoy it as and the daft plotting doesn't spoil it all that much, just limits it as a film. I know there is already a sequel being planned and, as much as the plot could do with a bit more polish, it is the comedy where the film needs to step it up – with the big laughs repeated and the amusing tone elevated to produce more good laughs. The cast is mostly reasonably good. Harrelson plays up to his character really well and his deadpan reactions to lines of others makes many scenes funnier thanks to his timing and delivery. Eisenberg is good once you try and get used to the feeling that the film couldn't afford Michael Cera. His narration and the use of his rules provide a good structure to the film. Stone and Breslin are both a little irritating as characters but they just about manage to be good enough in other ways to help cover up their characters. The cameo by Bill Murray was spoilt for me but it was still funny (even if it suffers from slightly illogical, clunky writing).Overall Zombieland is not a brilliant film by any means but it has a hatful of good laughs on a bed of consistently amusing material and tone. The gore is cartoony and not scary but the film is more of a comedy than horror so this is not a problem. Good enough to be worth a look and it made for an enjoyable 90 minutes mostly spent chuckling for me.",Null,1,2,14 February 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Classic bit of American propaganda that never fails to warm the heart
","`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others.  Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide.  In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue.  He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him.  Can this life George out of his despair?'Who hasn't seen this film?  Anyone?  It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming.  The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall.  The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc.  So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way.  It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra.  Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position.  Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits.  But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really?  Why can't it be - if only for two hours.  This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world.",Null,9,19,8 February 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Very effective thriller with only a few dead spots
","When Vassili Zaitsev first arrives at the Russian front in Stalingrad, he finds himself stuck in one man's land and, before returning to his own lines, takes out five officers with one rifle.  Looking for a morale booster, Political Officer Danilov uses Vassili as a hero to spur the other men on.  However when the Germans' morale falls due to the snipers, they bring in Major Konig, an expert sniper, to hunt down and kill the Russian hero.  Thus begins a game of cat and mouse between the two men.For some strange reason I had got the impression that this film was slow, overlong and dull.  I can't remember where I got that impression from (maybe unfair critics?) but it stopped me going to the cinema to see it.  As it was, I really enjoyed the film and was very pleasantly surprised by just how good it was.  I expected something full of pretension and long, slow pauses but instead it was am effective little thriller which was tight in the right places and only a little baggy and slow at times.The film manages to give a good impression of the war in Stalingrad and, while not totally up to `Private Ryan' shock power, the opening 15 minutes are very realistic and very powerful.  After this point the cat and mouse game is simply done but pretty exciting.  The only aspect that I felt slowed things down a tad was the romantic subplot involving Tania.  This didn't help the pace of the film but, with the way the film goes, was a necessary part of the plot overall.The cast are good all round, with even small roles taken by well known actors.  Law is very good in the lead and he holds the attention well whether lying totally still or having a crisis of confidence.  Fiennes is not quite as good but is still OK, his character is less clear and is very much secondary to Law's.  Weisz is OK but it is hard to accept her clean skin and beauty in a character such as hers, she doesn't do a bad job, but I think it could have been better with someone else.  Although Harris doesn't say very much he has a great screen presence and his character is strong for that as opposed to development.  The support cast includes Bob Hoskins and Perlman.Overall this is not a perfect film but it is very atmospheric, with a great sense of time and place and the main game of cat and mouse is very enjoyable and quite tense.  Much better than I expected it to be.",Null,5,8,30 November 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Not perfect but a typically polished and professional story that is well told
","As a young man, John Nash is antisocial, arrogant but quite the mathematical genius. After months of failing to live up to expectation due to focusing on trying to find formula within the mundane. However a major finding brings him to the attention of the Government and sees him set up within a secretive department looking to crack the code that will lead them to a Russian bomb hidden somewhere within the US. Starting as just a series of problems, John's involvement deepens as the Russians move to stop the code breakers and only John's handler Parcher can protect him. Meanwhile the secrets start to affect John's personal life.Despite all the hype and awards I didn't feel that fussed about seeing this film and just decided to wait for television to bring it to me for free. Having finally seen it I must admit that, while not being anything brilliant, it is certainly a very professional and engaging product despite some big flaws. The story is based on reality (if you pardon the irony of that) and it doesn't matter too much if it skims over some issues and omits some very well-publicised aspects of Nash's life. The story is well written and is the better for focusing on the confusion within Nash between reality and imagined because it does help move the film forward all the time. Conversely the weakest moments are in the rather mawkish and sentimental moments within reality  fortunately these are not that often and generally the film moves forward well and I did find myself quite engaged by it.Howard's direction is up to his usual standard, by which I mean that it is polished and professional even if it does lack anything in the way of flair or unique talent. Crowe is very strong though. Much better than the ego and the headlines would suggest, here he delivers a performance that convincingly changes across the film and does the tricky thing of making the audience feel and understand a character in a way that was very difficult to pull off. Connelly is nearly as strong in a smaller role and Ed Harris has fun with a powerful character who noticeably lifts the pace when he is on screen. Bettany is his usual self and good value for it and support is generally good from Plummer, Lucas, Goldberg and a few others.Overall a very polished drama but one that is engaging for the majority. The pace is generally good despite sometimes being a bit too sentimental and laboured, and the delivery generally pulls off the difficult task of putting us into Nash's world and allowing us to feel for him and understand him.",Null,6,14,25 September 2005
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Not brilliant but enjoyably funny
","Berated by his father over his love of rock just one time too many, JB is convinced that a vision of rock has summoned him to Hollywood. Having been to all of the Hollywood's in the US, JB finally washes up in Los Angeles where he comes across 'rock God' KG playing for change on the boardwalk. Seeing the boy's adoration, KG takes JB in and teaches him the way of rock in return for chores. When it transpires that KG is far from the person he seemed to be, a friendship has been formed and the stars appear to be in alignment for them to achieve greatness. They only lack on thing  the legendary pick of destiny. And so a quest begins.This is one of those films that, if you really get into it, you'll probably be rolling with laugher and find it a great joy from start to finish. This group is the minority of people though and the rest of us will find a comedy that is mostly amusingly silly and occasionally misfiring. It is a very fine line it walks as the genre of rock opera is a spoof in itself so really this film does feel like it is trying to spoof something that doesn't need spoofing. That said the overblown narrative and songs make for a silly and engaging comedy, with plenty of outrageous moments catching me laughing. Sadly too often the line is crossed and it spills over into the overly-silly or puerile. I was surprised by how well it walked this line because to me the trailer had made it look terrible. Watching it from the start though, it does create an atmosphere in which it does work  which it obviously never got in the trailer.I'm not a massive fan of Jack Black but within this creation his OTT rock performance works. He will still annoy those that get annoyed by his basic performance but those people will be unlikely to enjoy any part of the film since it is entirely in his image. Of course not to take away from Glass, who is pretty much his equal here and is a bit better than Black if only because his performance is a bit more restrained. Support is mostly just a handful of fun cameos featuring Meat Loaf, Grohl, Stiller and Robins among a few others.Overall then, this is a silly, overblown affair but it does work if you buy into it as a spoof version of a rock opera epic. It isn't as hilarious as some would have you believe but it is sporadically funny once it gets you in the mood and, while far from brilliant, it is an enjoyably silly film.",Null,1,2,13 April 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Enjoyable with decent (if over indulgent) plot
","Trapped at his home by his foster family, Harry is visited by a house elf and warned not to return to Hogwarts as it holds great danger for him. However this only serves to make him want to go all the more, despite the fact that many barriers seem to spring up in his path.  When he arrives there he finds much changed, not least a new teacher in the shape of Professor Lockhart.  The danger arrives when someone opens the mythical (and hidden) chamber of secrets and releases a beast that aims to kill all the mixed blood wizards.  Himself a suspect, Harry must race to find not only the beast, but also the one who released it, before it kills again.After having a poor impression from the first film, I decided to skip this at the cinema  the idea of an average film being worth the horror of sharing a cinema with talking children being a major factor.  However on DVD I decided to give it a go and was happy to see that it was actually quite an enjoyable film that has a good plot to it.  I still feel that the running time (almost 3 hours) is far too long for this type of film and that some brave editor needs to take it and really be harsh with the material, the plot here sort of demands the long run but at times scenes are too indulgent and the cuts to reduce time could have been found without too much loss.The film does move quite easily though, despite the 3 hour run.  The problem is that children will generally lose interest faster than adults, making it harder on the rest of us to stay with the film  I mean, how many toilet breaks will be taken during this film?  Despite this I did find it involving and the film kindly tailored itself to be user-friendly to both fans and those like me who have never had the desire to read a single HP book.  The material is probably too dark for children and I doubt many younger than 10 will actually have followed the full run of the narrative.The action scenes are an area that could have been trimmed down.  I don't know if the film is trying to stay very true to the book but I did feel that some scenes (the flying car, the Quidditch games) could have been either reduced or removed altogether.  Some scenes work very well and are exciting and creepy and this is due to better direction (maybe from not feeling the pressure of starting a franchise?) and also some very good effects.The cast is still deep in faces and again suffers from not having enough for everyone to do.  Radcliffe is a bit better in the lead role but Watson and Grint seem to have been put back into second place despite being a real strength of the first film.  Rickman is enjoyable and Branagh is a good choice for the character of Lockhart, OTT enough to be a comedy character but not so much a clown that he is ruled out as a possible bad guy.  Richard Harris has little to do and it is sad that when he died most obituaries in the popular press made reference to this role rather than any of his massive back catalogue.  Cleese is once again wasted, Maggie Smith gets a few days work out of it and Coltrane serves only as a red herring at several points along the way.  Faces from British comedy make for local interest but again it is a problem that the film tries to have the same rich tapestry of characters that I imagine the book did  at some point a disciplined focus is required in this series, imagine the running times once they start making the thicker books in the series with the same approach!Overall I had no intention of ever watching this film but am glad I gave it a shot.  I still feel that it is a little over indulgent and that it needs to be better controlled, but the good plot and enjoyable set pieces made for a good film.  I have not been won over enough to see the next chapter in the cinema but I'll get it on video a few years later.",Null,3,5,1 September 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Really dumb and silly but quite breezy fun if you are in the mood for it
","John and Jane have been married for five or six years and pretty much have the American ideal; they live in a big home in a nicely white and middle-class suburb, they both drive nice cars and both have very good careers. Sure they have problems in their marriage but outwardly they look great and they are getting counselling for the lack of spark anyway. The real problems probably come from the fact that, unbeknownst to one another, he is not really a building contractor and she is not really a computer expert, really they are both professional killers working for different companies. This is all well and good until they both get sent to do the same job and narrowly miss killing one another. Discovering the other's secret identity, they both assume that the other is only in the marriage to get information and mark the other so neither has a choice but to try and kill the other first.From the plot summary alone you've probably got the idea that this is not the film to come for if you are in a cerebral mood. The plot is rather silly to say the least, the action OTT and the whole thing is utterly unconvincing and unengaging. However it is all rather fun and entertaining in a big, dumb, noisy summer blockbuster sort of a way. On this level it is possible to just take it as it comes, ignore the lack of substance and be taken in by the slick style with which it is all carried off. It helps that all those involved know to deliver it with their tongues in their cheeks, so it never looks stupid, it knows it is silly but it also knows that it is entertaining and, in the summer market, that is all it is required to be doing. The result is that it all moves forward quickly and constantly with an air of slick confidence that produces funny lines and plenty of big noisy action.Of course it is not the film to bring your brain to, because if you think about it you have lost the point and will no enjoy it. I found myself thinking once or twice and forced myself to just get lost in the film as a product that than a story. I thought about how the characters were more about the celebrities than the writing, but this didn't matter because that was part if the appeal of the film. I thought about how the action lacked any tension or anything to really hook me in, but that was mainly because the film and characters had no substance below the slick exterior, so the action matched that approach. I also found some of the scenes of violence a bit hard to take - was I the only one who watched this married couple punching and shooting each other and thought how the real sufferers of domestic violence would not appreciate such a sensual and funny look at the subject? Like I said though, I nipped these thoughts in the bud because the film is not about the detail, it is about the glossy finish - the engine of this car might have been a couple of badgers on a treadmill, but the bodywork had definitely been 'pimped'!With such a glossy vehicle, it was important to have a couple of really sexy stars who have chemistry to carry off the silly nonsense. Fortunately the stars are textbook for that type of stuff. Pitt has been slickly moving through Ocean's 11/12 and Jolie is sexy/sassy personified. Individually they keep the quips coming, never take it seriously at any point and manage to make knife wounds, bruises and wounds sexy and cool. Together they both seem to get the joke and their slick deliveries go really well together; I could not care less about the whole 'are they/aren't they' gossip column nonsense but they really did make this product work by turning up the 'slick' quotient to 11. For me personally though I felt that Vaughn stole the show by doing his usual stuff - he is consistently funny and his rougher character made for a really nice contrast to the endlessly slick delivery in every other section.It is all nonsense of course and I had started to forget it the moment I left the cinema, but it does what it sets out to do pretty well; not to make you think, not to provide realism, not to be tense, not to engage your emotions but simply to provide a slick, funny film that lives entirely on the surface and never stops moving in case you notice this. This it all does well and, for all the problems with it, it is indeed sexy, smart, funny, noisy and enjoyable. Not great by any means but will certainly keep the target audience happy.",Null,16,36,17 July 2005
The Departed," Enjoyable thriller but there are failings and missed targets across the running time
","The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target #1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men, meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.Having enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.Ironically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.Overall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be  with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had.",Null,37,61,7 November 2006
Die Hard," Great action, well directed, tense and slick action thriller with enjoyable performances and intelligent social subtext (spoilers)
","I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980's and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a 'normal' guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar 'man's man' type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines ('ladies & gentlemen'); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between 'man's man' and 'new man'  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a 'quick-draw' style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid 'buddy'; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years.",Null,18,26,12 July 2007
American Made," Inconsistent in what it does but still manages to be broadly entertaining
","Pilot Barry Seal is recruited by the CIA to run a covert operation flying into South America; quickly he gets in deeper and deeper, with money flowing in all directions but significant risk with it.Considering this is a Tom Cruise film, I was surprised how quickly it came and went from the cinemas in the UK. Based on a true story, the film rattles through the plot with a Goodfellas air but an inconsistent control of what it is trying to do and how it is trying to do it. It is a caper to be sure, and it has a broad humor to it; but at the same time it does have consequences and real drama behind it. It tries to do both of these things but it doesn't manage it. As a result the dirty, greasy heat of the drama knocks the swagger out of the fun, while the broad sense of caper it tries to deliver makes it feel disconnected from the stakes and realism of the drama. While both sort of work, neither really work that well.Cruise is equally in two places. On one hand I thought he played it really well and convinced in his performance, but at the same time he never stopped being Tom Cruise with his winning smile and slick ways; it broke me out of the character too much and too often. The supporting cast has plenty of talent in there too, but the fast pace and slightly superficial story-telling means nobody ever has time to bed in and make something of their characters outside of Cruise. Production values are high and do well to give the film a sense of time and place with design and delivery.Overall though, it is a fairly forgettable film that tries hard but doesn't convince. You can see the goals of Goodfellas and Wolf of Wall Street, but it doesn't get close and generally undercuts itself with inconsistency in what it is doing.",Null,2,3,5 June 2018
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The money is all up there on the screen, but not a lot else
","There is one thing that you can almost always say about the blockbuster films of Michael Bay and his ilk, and that is that the money is very clearly up there on the screen. The money is there in terms of the locations, the expensive sets, the destruction of those expensive sets and of course the many robots who do always feel like they are really 'in' the scene with the real aspects. In terms of all this the film is impressive and if you go into the film wondering how on earth anyone could spend so much money making a two hour film then you will leave the cinema with your question answered because it is all right there.Unfortunately there is not much else there with it and indeed many of the problems with the film (and unsurprisingly there are many) cannot be addressed by simply having a lot of money in your hand to throw at it. The plot is the most immediate problem, partly because you have to keep the two human characters central to it whether it makes sense to do so or not. As a result we get a reasonable idea that is stretched too thin and loaded with convenience into a narrative that really never does anything other than provide the most basic of frames for stuff blowing up. The problem is that, because it is so contrived and basic, the viewer never really cares about the story but yet still has to sit through many clunky scenes where the characters explain to one another what is going on and why they are now going somewhere else to blow stuff up. Needless to say that the same writers struggling with this are not able to make much of the characters either. This conspires to undermine the one selling point of the film – the action. Without me caring one bit about the proceedings, the action becomes nothing more than special effects. My heartbeat never increased and my palms never got sweaty because there is no tension, danger, thrill or reason to have any emotional investment in the film whatsoever.The writing produces the most painful problem as well, which is the lame and ill-fitting attempts at comedy. While watching it I thought to myself 'Will Smith' does this very well' because the mixing of comedy with the action of big summer blockbusters is something he is called upon to do very often (I know it is not just him involved in making this work). However here the comedy is poor and it sits really badly alongside the action scenes because the humour is not part of the film so much as an aspect that is inserted in specific scenes. I say this because the film is not 'fun' in the way good blockbusters can be but rather it feels like boxes were ticked without any intention of whether the various elements fitted together or not. The low points are generally associated with two of the Transformers who have clearly been scripted in a meeting that involved the word 'urban' being used a lot. Mudflap & Skids are essentially urban stereotypes and I suspect that the people who wrote them probably think that Jar-Jar Binks is a great character as well. At best they are annoying and unfunny; at worst they are offensive race-related stereotypes.The cast (real and unreal) add to the film's problems although I will acknowledge that the cast don't have a lot to work with when you consider some of the lines they have to deliver and things they have to do. Having said that though, it doesn't help that the film is led by two 'stars' who we are told are the new big things but who still leave me wondering why on earth they get all this buzz around them. LaBeouf doesn't have the charisma to lead this film and he doesn't really work in comedy, action or romance. OK he jumps around a lot but that's about it – his material is awful at times and it does feel like he just 'went with it'. Fox's role is a lot easier. As with the promotion of the film at various premieres (Fox front and centre, posing for the many press), the film pushes her body to the fore – her first scene has her repeating her 'bent over' pose from the first film, this time over a motorbike. Personally I don't really see it and am not sure why she is famous while countless equally attractive women have yet to get a breakthrough –outside of her body there doesn't appear to be much else that makes her noteworthy. Oh, and if she is going to continue working her body in action movies, someone needs to buy her a decent sports bra or she find her assets 'depreciating' the more 'running from explosion' scenes she does. Turturro doesn't escape the rot but at least he is a bit of fun and even though he is so-so he steals every scene he is in – easy considering he shares some with the annoying Rodriguez. Duhamel and Tyrese do the same as last time with little to offer. The voice work is all very gravelly and fine with OK turns from Weaving, Cullen, Todd and others but Wilson and Kenny should be ashamed – blackface is unacceptable even when if one is a black actor 'wearing' it.Transformers 2 is noisy and expensive but offers no more than this. A lot of the problems come with the territory but they have the knock-on effect of leaving the viewer apathetic to the action and ultimately I found it dull and unengaging which is probably its single biggest failing. Might satisfy those just looking for noise and colour but offers little else for anyone else.",Null,6,36,6 July 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Creepy and effective thriller based on atmosphere and ambiguities (spoilers)
","Rosemary and Guy are newlyweds who move into a new apartment in an old building. They meet and befriend the elderly couple next door, the Castevet's, who are very friendly and make them both feel welcome. After Guy's acting career suddenly turns around and he lands quite a big role (due to the original actor going blind suddenly) the couple decide to try for a baby. They plan the night that they will try on both Rosemary gets drunk and passes out, dreaming of some weird rape-like attack. She awakes the next morning to find that Guy had just been drunk and had had sex with her anyway  but she forgives him when she finds she is pregnant. However with both Guy and the Castevet's acting strangely it appears that something strange is going on, or is it just a frustrated Rosemary's over imagination?Of course, many of us know the answer to this question; even those who have not seen the film will know that things are not just in Rosemary's head, however what makes the film so creepy and enjoyable is the fact that Polanski doesn't seem to want to make his mind up either and plays it right down the middle. As such the simple plot sees lots of ambiguity in the story for much of the story, although we are pretty sure something is going on the director never comes right out and says it, instead he continually suggests it while also pointing to Rosemary's mental instability. It is the confusion in Rosemary that makes this so creepy and engaging  she herself goes between disregarding her fears and embracing them and it is very effect in building the tension even if we know what is the truth (or else there wouldn't be a film!). However, even though we know what is coming, the end is still very creepy and I was surprised just how effective it was even on a second viewing.The story builds a nice conspiracy well and sustains a real creepy atmosphere all the way through to good effect. The performances are also key in pulling off Polanksi's trick. Farrow is suitable unbalanced and we feel her fear and suspicion growing during the film. Her performance is really good and the fact that she manages to balance her own doubt for most of the film is very effective. Cassavetes is also excellent, all at once he is friendly, cheerful, menacing and mysterious; he also plays a big part in creating the sense of doubt that drives the film's tension. Ruth Gordon is a nightmare neighbour and overplays very well even if her character is a bit of a cliché  I certainly would not want her for my neighbour, but she is never so creepy that we know for sure, only overbearing in a normal yet weird manner. Likewise Blackmer is effective as the potential head of the coven and is never too obvious to blow the tension. The support cast are all good and echo the performances of Blackmer and Gordon.Overall this is a great horror thriller. Another review on this site has rightly pointed out that too many modern films in this loose genre will have a vague tension over poor dialogue delivered by a 'teen-friendly' cast and then tonnes of expensive effects. Happily Polanski is smarter than that here and he uses doubt, tension and atmosphere blended with good dialogue and some fine characters to create a film that is never really scary so much as it is just creepy. Even though I know it inside out it is still effective and it doesn't bode well for modern films that rely on effects instead of these qualities.",Null,11,19,21 June 2004
Zero Dark Thirty," Engaging with an even-handed approach but it is a bit dry and not all the hype suggests
","This film arrived in the UK with the critical praise and Oscar nominations all very fresh and mostly untouched by negative opinion. The story is one all viewers will know going in – or at least the ending is. It is a story that has such a potential for emotion, whether it is in the terrorist attacks played out on screen or the final raid of the film and this potential had me worried that it would be overdone. Indeed since the events happened there was always going to be a film made of it, the question was whether or not it would be a gloating, excessively patriotic affair made to make 'Murica feel good about the revenge aspect of Bin Laden's death. Happily this is not really the case here (although it is hard not to feel some satisfaction) because director Bigelow and writer Boal have delivered a very patient film that condenses a decade-long manhunt down into a few hours and done so without overly pushing any agenda so much as trying to remain distant and just play it out.On one hand this makes for a very engaging film. Using Maya as our central character, we follow the story through torture, setbacks, small leads and ultimately into the risky raid. It is unfolded in a patient way which summarizes without making it a total simplification and, while it moves slowly, it does still hold the attention because the path is interesting and the destination important. The manner of the telling is important because it could easily have overdone the torture to condemn it, or alternatively overdo its use to justify it, but it really manages to do both and neither at the same time which is another reason it engages the viewer. It takes the same approach with the raid; those of us with Call of Duty style images in our head of what happened will be disappointed but it is actually more effective and tense for just how simply it is allowed to go – there are no excessive action move clichés and it is better for it.That said, I don't totally see the film that the critics are gushing over because the downside of how methodical and even-handedly it approaches the story is that it does lack the emotional highs that a more manipulative approach would have brought and it is telling how often we get these in other films since their absence is something you'll feel even if you know you don't actually miss them. The character of Maya is one example; Chastain has been roundly praised for her performance but actually I found her quite blank – which fits the approach but does mean she is not a strong character at the core of the film. Likewise the matter-of-fact move through the story does occasionally drag – not in so much of a way that it lost me, but just in a way that at times it felt quite dry to watch. The performances throughout fit this mould although again it is a necessary evil to keep it balanced and not allow big colorful characters or set-pieces to overtake reality.Zero Dark Thirty is a really interesting and engaging film that benefits and loses from the even-handed approach that it takes. It is a good story and I appreciated that I was allowed to bring my own politics to the film, not have others heavily thrust onto me. This does mean that at times it can be a little dry and slow in the telling and this does hurt the film, but to me the benefit outweighs the loss. Not everything the hype would suggest but certainly a very well told story.",Null,4,8,2 February 2013
Steve Jobs," Not perfect but its pace and scale makes for an engaging and intriguing character piece
","There is a certain irony (or perhaps deliberate synergy) in terms of how this film is constructed, and the subject it delivers. The focus is Steve Jobs, and we follow him in a three-stage film mostly spent backstage ahead of various product launches. We see products which are not quite as good as they are ready to be, being launched with a lot of energy and promotion. The same could be said of the film itself, because on the content level there is perhaps not as much to connect to as it may seem at first. Sorkin does his usual thing as writer – keeping everything moving quickly and with energy so that it is easy to get caught up in the pace. The script does deliver an engaging character piece, but there is not a great deal of reason to care about it – more to be intrigued by it.Despite this the film does work really well for what it is. The operatic scale and pace of the film is one of the main reasons for this; it sweeps across the years and uses flashback snippets to inform to good effect. The energy from this draws the viewer into the film, but it is the performances that keeps us there. Fassbender is brutal in his depiction; very on point throughout and plays the character in line with the writing. The support is just that, but still Winslet, Daniels, Rogan, and others all provide a strong base of performances for the lead to play off against.It is not a perfect film by any means, but in its pace and scale it makes for an engaging and intriguing character piece.",Null,0,1,2 July 2016
War of the Worlds," Darker and more impacting than the usual alien blockbuster but not as deep as it thinks it is and has a TERRIBLE cloying conclusion
","Ray Ferrier is a New Jersey man working on the docks, living alone, separated from his ex-wife and two children. Rachel and Robbie come to stay with him for the usual few days and none of them are particularly happy to see one another. However their visit is livened up by an intense electromagnetic storm that is powerful, exhilarating and exciting. What nobody could have known though is that the storms are only cover for an invasion of an alien species, after all, the chances must be a million to one of such an event. As the alien craft rise out of the ground and begin cutting an unstoppable swath across the world, Ray takes his children and flees the city  not sure where he is going but just hoping to survive long enough to work something out.With the names involved in this film you could be forgiven for expecting something more than just a blockbuster film and, in some ways you'd be right but then in almost as many ways you'd be wrong. In many ways this is better than a normal effects blockbuster, but mainly this is down to the fact that, since 9/11, few studios want to launch a massive film that takes pleasure in death and destruction in the way that Independence Day did. Instead this is much darker and more effective for it  scarier and tension than if it had been made with just spectacle in mind. It still delivers the goods in that regards but the effects are used well, producing scenes of destruction as well as a particularly impressive scene where the camera moves around a moving car in a way that would be impossible without computers.The downbeat and dark presentation suggested that there is more to this film that effects and I was tempted to look into the subtext as I watched it. Here I didn't find much of interest and perhaps I was trying to see things that weren't there. With the obvious awareness of real events and emotions, the film seems to promote 'everyman for himself', sacrificial heroics and other strange meanings that the film can't do anything with. Maybe I was expecting too much and really there wasn't anything below the surface but if there was then it didn't make a great deal of sense. Ignoring this aspect though, the film still works well enough as a dark 'alien invasion' film that entertains and thrills without letting the audience actually revel in or remain remote from the death and destruction.Spielberg keeps it moving well and gives the film an convincing feel; darkness and light are used well and the locations are good, certainly making for a nice change from us watching the usual landmarks being destroyed  his focus is more on the people and real communities. For most of the film he manages to avoid the mawkish sentimentality that invades many of his films but he gives it up right at the end; the final few minutes had me walking out of the cinema shaking my head. I'm not referring to the bacteria ending (everyone knew that was coming) but to the terrible family reunion scene that is so horribly corny and cheesy that it turned my stomach. Did we need it? It smelt like a tacked on ending from a test screening but part of me knows that Spielberg is probably as guilty as anyone. For such a dark and destructive film it was a terrible ending and the previous 110 minutes deserved much better.Cruise is pretty good but he is far from being the ordinary working Joe that the script asks him to be. He can do the action stuff well and he is well practiced in acting alongside special effects but he is not a New Jersey shoreman! Fanning is as good as ever, convincing in her emotions but again perhaps a bit too precious to be a 'real' child. Chatwin is OK as Robbie but his character made very little sense to me and he didn't seem to understand what significance he played either. The support cast are mostly screaming extras; Robbins is quite good but Robinson and Barry's cameos are minimised by the fact that they are involved in that terrible, terrible ending. As with all blockbusters, the effects are the stars and they are worthy of the billing.Overall this is a good summer film that has a post-9/11 darkness and tone to it that some might find not quite conducive to enjoying the bangs that the summer audience usually want. However I quite liked this approach and found it more engaging and impacting. The effects are good and the performances fit in with them well but be warned  the cloying sentimentality of the last few minutes is really hard to stomach and will leave you with a really bad aftertaste.",Null,22,37,25 July 2005
Love Actually," Could have been so much better and is flawed in so many ways but it just about works as a sweet `date' movie but no more than that
","It's a matter of weeks until Christmas in London and despite the claims by Billy Mack's song that `Christmas is all around' really it is love that seems to be everywhere.  Some of it is flirting, some of it is infatuation, some of it is lust, some of it is loss, some of it is dedication, some of it is failing, some of it is adulterous, some of it is longing and some of it is unrequited.  In a thinly connected collection of lives, we see men and women involved in all the various types of love as the festive season approaches.Despite the hype and critical fawning over this film, I didn't bother going to the cinema to see this film as love, actually, pretty much sucked at that moment in my life!  Things hadn't really changed when I got round to seeing it on DVD but I didn't feel that I could allow myself to miss the `best British film ever' for any more time.  The film starts with one of the most morally abhorrent openings I have seen in quite some time - I put it right up there with Doberman for having the opening that made me think about stopping the film a matter of seconds into the movie.  Curtis is a successful writer, but using the memory of the murdered families of 9/11 and cashing in on their dying sentiments is tasteless in the extreme and I was shocked that he had done it.  Despite this, I stuck with the film (hell - I'd paid for it!) and was glad to find that he didn't misfire this badly again.  However the film is not as good as the hype would suggest it to be although it is amusing enough to watch once and to keep you involved.The film does well to just about keep control of so many different strands and special mention should probably go to the editors for keeping it together.  However, this does not meant that the plot is any good - just that it hangs together well despite the difficulties it presented.  It is not that good; the majority of the strands are underdeveloped and very superficial.  The `love' and relationships here do not engage and never really seem real - only the marriage damaged by flirting struck me as being a good shot at reality for many people.  The rest of the relationship are the ones you get in film - where it doesn't matter if they are based on physical attraction (like Jamie's cleaner), or on flirting or the thinnest of reasons because all that matters is that they are sweet and romantic for the duration of the film.  In this regard it manages to be just about amusing enough without ever really being funny and enjoyable without ever really being charming.  I doubt that, for me, it would hold up to repeat viewings though - the substance is just too lacking for that.What surprised me about the film most was just how very focused the characters were in terms of relationships.  With so many different characters I was surprised that each and every relationship was a) straight and b) white.  OK - Juliet's husband was black, but he was not the romantic focus of her strand.  This is not a claim of racism or anything so stupid, I was just surprised that Curtis didn't at least try to write in an `alternative' relationship to what is admittedly the `norm'.  This didn't spoil the film for me but I would have liked to see such an ensemble piece include a spread of relationships (without just making it a token thing).The cast is stellar and it is just as well as their `familiarity' helps to cover the fact that the script doesn't really help us to get to know any of the characters.  Nighy has a good time in his role and his `love' would actually have been the sweetest and most touching one of the film had it not been handled as a joke.  Firth is charming but his character is paper-thin - we see no emotion from him considering the situation at the start and his `love' is out of nothing.  Grant is OK in the most comic of the relationships but his dance is the worst scene in the film and the `anti-American' bit just seems to come out of nowhere and go nowhere. Neeson is good, but again I never felt his loss as a real thing.  Rickman and Thompson's thread is the strongest of the film and the only problem I had with them was that the film had a scene with Rickman talking about `Karl' and I couldn't stop laughing!  The remainder are mixed - Linney's relationship is interesting but not expanded on, while Freeman's stuff could easily have been lost.  Special mention from me for Sosanya - she has little to do here but she is a very good actress who still does stage work (and also happens to be gorgeous!).  The star cameos are OK - they don't add a great deal but they don't detract either - all seem to be beautiful women so I can't complain for the inclusion of Richards, Cuthbert and Schiffer. However add Wes Butters, Jo Wiley, Atkinson (pointless), Ant & Dec (funny - `Ant or Dec'!), Thornton, Parkinson and so many others and you begin to wonder why the film had to cram in so many.  To be honest with you I truly believe that this film could have been so much more touching, romantic and involving if it had lost half of these stories and just developed the remaining ones to be realer and more involving.Overall this isn't a very good film but it is so damn `busy' that it manages to make you miss the fact that it could have been so much better than it was.  The sheer amount of stuff going on means that very few of the relationship get beyond the superficial level of unrealistic romance, plus the fact that too few of the relationship bare any relation to reality (especially as more and more gorgeous cameos are wheeled out).  It may not be funny or charming but it does just enough so that it leaves you with a sweet feeling.  I quite liked it but found it hard to overlook these weaknesses - why it was so highly regarded by critics is quite beyond me but if you're after a typically romantic comedy that gives you a warm feeling with no sense of reality then this will probably do you.",Null,7,15,18 April 2004
12 Years a Slave," Absorbing, brutal and moving in a detached and visually beautiful way
","A few years ago now, Mel Gibson made Passion of the Christ; a film which essentially is one long tale of suffering of Jesus on his way to the cross. It was a film that I found to be as vacuous as pornography and an ordeal to sit through because I lost all feeling for the character as he became little more than the subject for violence. I mention this because I worried that this film would be the same as it is very much an issue film and much has been written about how numbing it is in terms of the content. I decided to watch it anyway, mainly because of the British involvement in the film – a lot of talent here, not least of which is director Steve McQueen.The story is based on the true story of a free man kidnapped into slavery. As a story it is one of interest but mainly it provides a central tangible point for the audience to identify with and to follow. It also gives us the oft-used narrative device of a character seeing things for the first time as we are (see also the rookie cop etc). In this way it works very well because we never really get lost in the violence or brutality of the film and, despite the claims of some, it never made me numb to it and it never felt like it was being overdone for the sake of it – if anything it builds very well so it get progressively harder to process. The film shows the extent of the system much better than just a series of beatings; it shows that even 'good' men are part of it, it shows that the options are zero and it shows that it is a world that has no edges – even though we know that Solomon is just a matter of distance from his rightful freedom, we never really feel that way at all because it is never escaping one place or one person.The story is well told to keep close to Solomon while also letting us see the reality and McQueen is excellent as director in how he shows it. In Hunger and Shame he sits back from his subjects in a rather detached but invasion way. It is hard to describe but long, wide shots leave us to observe simple scenes and often the simpler they are the more telling – as Solomon hangs while others go about their business, we understand the reality of this world and how utterly trapped everyone is – again, it is a system, this is just how it works. The relationship with Bobbitt continues to pay dividends because visually the film is stunning, great colors and great shots whether they be unflinching close-ups or wide and long. The use of music is good too – there is no sentimentality to it and when it is used it is subtle. This is not a film that overdoes the violence to hype it, but nor is a film that pulls on the heartstrings – it feels very factual and very realistic within the context of the system, so while the audience flinch at a particular brutal scene, the film itself does not – because this is how it is in the world we are in.The cast give very good performances in support of this goal, so while some of them are basic roles, the people give good presence and don't ham it up. In particular Ejiofor gets the balance right, his desperation and horror is pushed down as much as he can because of how the system he is in works, but he engages and moves throughout. Fassbender likewise walks the line – he is never a pantomime villain but he is still cruel and hateful. Supporting roles from Nyong'o, Dano, Williams and many others is roundly very good with only one misstep which is Pitt, which is a shame – his face is almost too famous and breaks the ensemble feel, plus the virtue of his character also makes his casting in that specific role seem a little bit like a vanity casting for a producer. This is a minor thing though, since he himself is not bad, but anyway the rest of the cast are convincing and engaging.12 Years a Slave looks like it will be just another Oscar-baiting slavery film, but it is much better than that to be fair the awards hype sullies it a little bit. It is absorbing and brutal in its convincing and detached portrayal of this world, complete with strong performances it is a memorable experience and very well made film.",Null,17,33,12 January 2014
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Very slight but does have a detached, awkward charm to it that is helped by fairly frequent laughs and amusing moments
","Nick is a bassist in his friend's band, which is today called The Jerk-Offs. He goes to play with them at a small venue despite his broken heart and unending attempts to get back with Tris through the medium of mixtapes. At the venue he is not only confronted with Tris with a new guy but also with the equally geeky and awkward Norah, who has admired Nick unseen by listening to his mix CD's when Tris bins them unheard. Their love of similar music sees them seeking out a secret gig by the band Where's Fluffy but things go wrong along the way, throwing them into chaos which may morph into a first date.If the title and the (very good) soundtrack doesn't tell you what to expect from this film then the main cast almost certainly will because we are firmly in 'awkwardly-cool' territory. With this in mind it is best to approach with caution if you're not a fan of this because there is not a lot more than this to win over the casual viewer. The narrative itself will not be enough because the story is a pretty loose thread about Nick and Norah falling for one another against a backdrop of a 'cool, crazy night in NYC', which is a thread that doesn't really work. The style of the characters is of geeky detachment and this does have the knock-on effect on the story by never making the viewer really care that much for the characters as real people or getting that engaged in the story. Fortunately, if you like this sort of thing, you will find that it does have enough awkward charm to carry it off as a sort of quirky youthful piece but even then you won't find a romance that has much beyond this superficial charm. Instead the film rides this free-wheeling charm for as long as it can. As my partner observed, few people this age are really this sorted, cool and free but the film needs them to be for this to work so they are. They have the run of NYC without limits of space, time or money to hinder them and in this regard the audience is drawn into this world and it felt fresh and fun. The laughs are sporadic but frequent enough to hold the attention while generally the aforementioned charm held me in a genial state where I was happy being even when the film wasn't working that well. The side characters help this a lot as they have no pressure on them narratively and so can be superficial and fun and still work.The casting of Cera is hardly a stretch since this awkward stuff is his bread and butter. It would be nice to see him do something else (although I still want the Arrested Development film) but he is solid here, doing what is expected of him. Dennings is the same, doing awkward/ironic detachment very well and complimenting the overall style of the film. As I said though, the problem is that, with so much geeky-cool detachment the central relationship doesn't really work even if their charm means we quite like the characters. Yoo, Gavron and Gaynor are all fun and light in supporting roles that add energy and movement to the story but I felt a bit for Dziena who is a very simple manipulative character without any sense of being a real person below this. I'm told that this is not the case in the book so I may read that in the future. As suggested by the title of the film, the soundtrack is really good and fits the characters and feel of the film.As a total product though, Nick & Norah is not a film that will be embraced by a mass audience. It is far too slight and superficial to draw the audience into the central relationship and it does rely on charm and an energetic and youthful tone to carry it through. Don't get me wrong - I found it charming, nice and quite fun, generally enjoying it but the minute it ended the memory started to fade and it is one of those films that does the job but not to the extent that it makes any sort of lasting impression.",Null,2,3,5 February 2009
Wedding Crashers," Good comedy that only struggles when it has to focus on the actual narrative
","John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey are committed bachelors who enjoy their womanising ways. They specialise in crashing weddings and picking up women for one night stands by taking advantage of their lower defences. Countless scores of women later, John is getting tired but the offer of 'one last big job' tempts him back to crash the wedding of Treasury Secretary Cleary's daughter. Things go well until John falls for Claire Cleary while Jeremy finds himself trapped with the frighteningly clingy Gloria as the pair accept an invitation back to the weekend retreat of the Cleary family.This did not appear strong enough to draw me into the cinema on its release but, on an trans-Atlantic flight it looked like being good enough to fill some time  which is actually a pretty fair summary of the film's strengths and weaknesses. I say this because it is funny enough to cover the problems that it has and thus will serve up as an enjoyable experience if you're relaxed enough to let this happen. The strengths lie in the lead two characters  they banter, they are lively and they are funny. Funny enough to cover up the fact that they are exploitative and sexual predators and funny enough to mean that the scenes where they are doing their thing are generally enjoyable. Of course it helps that Wilson and Vaughn are both doing their thing as usually and have great chemistry together  good news if you usually like them but, if you don't, then why bother? The weaknesses come in with the actual story because, every time someone has to fall in love with someone else, the laughs stop, the pace slows and the whole thing takes on a mushy air that doesn't gel that well with the banter scenes. Likewise the plot devices in the second hour tend to feel a little forced where they are just used to provide direction and create a proper ending etc. This doesn't mean it is terrible but it cannot be a good thing when you actively wish the plot would take a backseat in a film. The support cast share the comedy reasonably well; McAdams is cool and appealing, Fisher is a bit OTT but is funny, Seymour plays on her sexy image really well while Walken is reliable as ever as Christopher Walken.Overall this is an enjoyable if patchy comedy. It trades on the usual delivery and chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn and the two do well to produce the film's best scenes when they are together. The need for a plot, romance and separation does hurt the film a little (because it is not as good as the aimless banter) but not a massive amount. Not a great comedy then but certainly good enough to please anyone who liked Anchorman, Dodgeball and other films of similar styles of humour.",Null,47,73,11 December 2005
There Will Be Blood," A marvellous character study of ambition gone sour and endless greed
","As a struggling silver miner, Daniel Plainview scrapes together a living until he stumbles upon a more profitable route for this talents  oil drilling. Starting small with one crew and one pitch, the film follows the growth of Plainview's business as he starts to expand. When he learns of oil-rich land out west in California, he and his young son head out there to capture the land and the rights to drill in the area. It is here that he meets the aspiring preacher Eli Sunday, who is interested in what the oil profits can do for his church. As with many of his recent ventures, this new location is a success although, with every victory and crushed competitor, Plainview's drive and ambition grows and consumes all around him.I had heard so much hype and praise for this film on its release that I decided to wait a while before going to see it; after all then someone is saying that it 'rewrites cinema' (or words to that effect) then it is hard to come to it as an individual without feeling the pressure to praise it and love it so as to not stand out from the crowd. Recently I watched it and was pleased by how easily I was drawn into it but also how quickly the three hour running time flew past. From the very start the story-telling begins and through simple scenes we come to understand the drive and sacrifice made by Plainview to even have a foot on the ladder. It is to the film's credit that it does not paint him as unworthy of the success he will find this way and the viewer is not able to hate him for his intrepid spirit and hard work. It goes without saying that the film follows the logical extension of his drive to succeed and that the next two-thirds of the film presents a much harsher and unpleasant side to this ambition.It is a subject I have often wondered about because the CEO of where I work is in his sixties but is still working and active, making hundreds of thousands each day with shares movements and deals  what makes him keep going when he could clearly just pack it in, buy an island and sit on it. Well, whatever it is, it is probably the same motivation that got him to the position he is in. I am not in any way aligning the two men, but with There Will Be Blood, this is very much the crux of the film as it is a character piece looking at Plainview in this regard. The way it does it is with patience and intelligence so that it is never a matter of one act that pushes him too far, or one moment that flicks a switch within him but rather that it is simple, logical and totally natural for this character. I do think that the conclusion perhaps could have been better but otherwise it is a faultless piece of work.Visually the film is striking. Not for any one image or moment of style though, but for the endlessly eye-catching framing of shots or positioning of the camera. The canvas of the western is of course present but we are never staring at it and somehow, even as two characters greet each other by a pipe being buried against a wide horizon, we are still focused on the tiny characters. A lot of this has to do with an utterly convincing performance from Daniel Day Lewis  it has been said loads but I cannot help but repeat how good it is. Again, it is not down to one moment that can be used as a clip for the Oscars but rather a complete immersion in the character so that he is able to convince whether as a man starting out or a man who is at the end of his life. No matter how impressive the visuals, you never take your eyes of him. To me he is the whole film and the support cast do struggle by being in his shadow to a certain extent, but mostly they all still work. Dano is probably the secondary most important character in the piece and he does pretty well with it although he doesn't really seem to age across the film, which I found distracting and detracting from his work.Along with the visual structure, the use of music is impressive, never forcing its way over the action and only ever being part of what is happening  it is the Academy's loss that they 'couldn't' recognise the score because the absence of this film makes them look daft. Indeed, in hindsight, so does the dominance at the awards of No Country For Old Men and it should have been more of an even split because they are both very good and very thoughtful films  although for me There Will Be Blood has it over the Cohen's here. OK it is not as entertaining or as accessible a film as that thriller but it is much more engaging and interesting in what it does. From script through acting, filming, scoring and total delivery, it is a magnificent film.",Null,13,23,10 August 2008
Ice Age," Not overly sentimental but not quite as sharp as I wanted
","As the ice age approaches, the majority of animals are heading south to the heat and survival.  However sloth Sid gets left behind by his family and immediately gets himself into trouble.  When mammoth Manny reluctantly comes to his help he finds Sid sticks with him.  When the pair come across a human baby that has just escaped a sabre tooth tiger attack they plan to return him to his village but have to enlist the help of one of the tigers to help track them down.  But can they trust Diego?Someday I'm sure we will tire of CGI animated tales of creatures that all have famous voices and sharp wits, but so far that day has yet to come.  Ice Age doesn't totally stand out in the field of really enjoyable films within the genre (I'd say Shrek, Monsters Inc, Toy Story) but it is funny enough to be worth watching.The plot doesn't matter all that much suffice to say that a quest is undertaken and lessons are learned about friendship  so far nothing new. What it does allow is plenty of comedy set pieces and jokes that, as usual, are aimed at adults as much (if not more so) than the children themselves. Ranging from quick visual gags to longer physical stuff for kids it is all quite enjoyable.  The only weakness I felt it had was the lack of a really sharp edge  most of it is quite average rather than being imaginative and hilarious.The cast do pretty well.  As much as I dislike him as an actor (too many bad performances!) Leguizamo does a really good job as Sid and carries a lot of the film.  Romano is a solid Manny while Leary never really gets to use his comedy skills as Diego  although thinking of his old acts, maybe that's for the best here!Overall I didn't feel that Ice Age stood out as one of the better of the recent genre but it is still funny and worth a watch.  If I'm honest it did sort of put me in the mood to go and watch one of the better ones in it's class.",Null,4,8,1 September 2003
To Kill a Mockingbird," Good story but not that well told
","Told in hindsight by Scout this is the story of how she and her brother remember one summer in the Deep South when their father, Atticus Finch defends a black man (Robinson) who has been accused of forcing himself on a white girl and then beating her.  Atticus finds himself in a battle for the truth in the face of racism and intolerance and also defending his children from the impact of the same on them.I first read the book in school and have re-read it several times as it has really stuck with me. Since then I have seen the film a couple of times but have never felt that it really reaches the same height as the book does. The telling of the story is at it's strongest in the courtroom as it takes on the principles of a courtroom thriller however outside of this central piece it is almost a Southern cliché  with the kids, the community etc.  It still works but it feels like a postcard compared to the reality of the South in the intolerance of the courtroom.The film doesn't totally bring through the themes of the books  instead focusing on the specifics.  This is necessary to make it all fit into the 130min running time but it is to the subject matter's detriment as it loses much of it's significance.  That's not to say it is not impacting, because it still is.  I do have a problem with the first half and the end of the film where the focus is entirely on the children before sudden jumps into the main plot.  In the book it is all part of the same thing, here it does feel like it is a different chapter.Peck is good in his usual moral indignation role and he is well supported by the two child actors who both seem natural  Badham (sister of the director) and Alford.  A very young looking Robert Duvall is in the film briefly and adds a bit of interest to the generally good supporting cast.  It is to the film's credit (considering the period and the setting) that the black characters are not just limited to `yessir' stereotypes although at times they come close.Overall I enjoyed this film and the courtroom scenes are pretty tense even knowing where it is going.  The narration of the grown up Scout is a little weak and some of the film appears to be wandering to no effect but it is still a good film.  I, however, would still rather re-read the book.",Null,16,26,23 March 2003
A Hard Day's Night," Amusing but dated as a film but a must-see for Beatles fans
","This film follows the Beatles on a tour of the south of England.  As usual they have all the problems associated with rushed schedules and high-pressure gigs  not to mention the screaming fans.  However this time they have an extra consideration in Paul's grandfather who has come along to see the sights.  He may be clean, but sadly he is a real stirrer and causes frictions in the band.I saw this in the mid nineties in a bar full of students and I found it very enjoyable.  To write a review of it I re-watched it last night and must say that it didn't have quite the same impact on me  maybe memory gave me a rose tinted impression of it.  That's not to say I don't enjoy it but it seems to have dated very badly and major aspects of it seem very `out'.  At it's heart the film is a way of getting the Beatles' music onscreen and feed the fans and, as a vehicle for them, it works very well.  It has no plot but has plenty of memorable scenes and uses the grandfather well as a central point.  The musical numbers are all great (of course) and all stand out.The humour is good but there are too few really big laughs to make it hilarious.  However it is still amusing with some good lines, imaginative bits and running jokes (`he's very clean').  The direction adds to the dated feel as Lester's jerky camera and student camera angles really make you know that it is from the 60's.  However to be fair the film IS from the 60's and for many this will not bother them as this is part of it's appeal.The Fab Four are great  all putting forward funny characters.  Lennon comes off the best as the sarcastic one, Paul is a little less interesting and George makes even less of an impression.  Ringo is very good  allowing himself to be made fun of but dealing with it well.  The support cast add much of the comedy and have a few famous faces.  Brambell (Steptoe) is the best of all the cast  his character is the funniest and is also the lynchpin for the majority of the film.  Other faces you may see include Derek Nimmo and Deryck Guyler.Overall this is a real must-see for anyone who likes the Beatles' music. The fact that it is funny will just add to it's appeal.  As a film it is dated and not as funny as one would hope but then this is not just a film is it?  Well worth a watch but sadly not as funny as I remembered it to be.",Null,2,4,4 May 2003
Man on Fire," An overdose of visual style from Scott and solid turns from the stars don't manage to cover the flaws in this overlong and run-of-the-mill thriller
","Heavily drinking and suffering from guilt over his past, former Marine Creasy arrives in Mexico City to take a job of low rent bodyguard from his friend Rayburn. Creasy's assignment is to look after the daughter of a troubled young businessman, ensuring that Pita is protected from kidnapping attempts. Initially cold to her, Creasy warms to his young ward and in turn she helps him rediscover his passion for life. However when he is badly wounded and Pita kidnapped, Creasy reacts with violent retribution, aiming to bring down the gang of kidnappers from the littlest fish to the top man.The trailer for this film was enough to make sure that I was interested  the intensive visual style and the tough talk and walk were enough to cover the nagging thoughts that I had basically been told the whole (very simple) plot in about 3 minutes. The strengths of the trailer cover the weaknesses of the film when they are presented in a very short time but the problem with the actual film is that it takes the same approach as the trailer did  ie entice the audience with a different and energetic visual style, along with tough talking and tough walking and hope that they will be so won over by these that they won't notice that the film is actually fairly average in almost every other aspect. The biggest failing is in the plot and the substance of the film as it never really does anything that is unpredictable and it is all rather workmanlike at times. The plot is a standard revenge film but it is rather full of itself and runs far too long to really suit the material  this stuff should be shorter and more brutal instead of being overly long. The running time is a problem because it does feel too long quite a few times but it wouldn't have been if the material had been there to carry it.Sadly the script doesn't do anything new. We expect Creasy and Pita to warm to one another and indeed they do  not with any touching or moving moments but with obvious moves. The ending is quite touching but by then it is too little too late and the film mainly just threads the line of least resistance with an obvious script. This trend continues in the actual plot, which takes too long to get to the action and then takes too long in delivering it. It is enjoyable to see such brutal violence in such a mainstream movie but Creasy's sudden transformation from flawed human being into near indestructible killing machine is a bit too much to swallow and misses the chance to be a more interesting revenge movie than it ultimately was.Of course the film does everything it can to try and distract us from the fact that this is an ordinary story by delivering it with all the energy of a child with a load of sugar in it. Scott blurs the shot, jerks it around, uses slow-mo, fades colours, everything  I didn't see it but I did get the feeling that somewhere in there was a kitchen sink. This is not a major problem because it was nice to watch and had plenty of nice touches (the subtitles appearing in rhythm or lingering on the screen) but without substance to back it up then it does feel pretty empty at times. Likewise the cast all try very hard but none of them really have much to work with. Washington rises to the harder role and seems to be looking for darker stuff since his Oscar for Training Day. He is always watchable but he never really makes the role his own or gets to the core of his character (only having Lethal Weapon-style drunken brooding to convey hidden depths). Fanning had the potential to be an annoyingly cute kid but she is better than that and she has a nice chemistry with Washington that makes us feel for her character rather than pray for her kidnapping (which I have done with other child performances). Support is not as good, mainly because they have as little to work with as the lead two but less time to make a mark. Walken is a nice addition but his presence is only a side-issue, which, funnily enough, is what Rourke seems to aspire to in a role that gives him so little screen time that you assume he is a larger character in the story than he appears to be (I don't consider a statement this obvious to be a spoiler!). The rest are OK with good turns from Giannini and Ticotin in thankless characters and a solid job from Mitchell.Overall this is a very average film that tries as hard as it can to hide this fact for as long as it can. Visually it is impressive but the lack of heart or substance rather detracts from Scott's work  making it come across as noise without content. The cast also try hard and a couple manage to do well even if they have little but the basics to work with. Sadly the running time exposes how empty the film is and soon even the intense visual style of the film became a bit tiresome. Not an awful film by any means but simply an average affair that tries to cover it by overdoing it in other areas where really it would have been better to concentrate on improving the weak areas instead of trying to cover them.",Null,8,17,17 October 2004
Edge of Tomorrow," Fast-paced, engaging and exciting high-concept sci-fi actioner which is a superior summer blockbuster
","Earth has been invaded and most of Europe has been taken over by a seemingly undefeatable alien foe. A small victory encourages an all- out assault on all front lines; into the middle of this is PR officer Major Cage – out of favor with a superior and finds himself dropped into boot camp as a deserter and forced onto the front line. Killed within minutes along with many others, Cage somehow finds himself walking up at the same point of the day before, stuck in a time loop which resets with each time he is killed. With every day giving him more knowledge and skill, Cage may be able to take the course of the battle.A very high concept idea doesn't always mean that things will work and it is worth acknowledging the good job that Edge of Tomorrow does in selling us the time-loop idea and throwing us into a world and scenario that is engaging. The idea seems to have its roots in video gaming since it is often the case when playing a game that one progresses through the level by gradually learning from mistakes and getting better at the skills you need. So it is with Cage and the film builds this idea very well at first. With very little background, we join a terrified Cage as he heads to certain death. This aspect is very well done as the battle sequence is brutal but also darkly comic. This rather dark streak continues as Cage makes tiny steps each time, with the repetition being exciting but also a little amusing.From here a plot starts to form, doing so from a point where the viewer is already engaged by the idea, the action and the effects. It does ultimately end up being less smart, edgy and brave than it seems, but by that point the film has done a lot to get us on board so we stay with it. The action sequences are really well done, and the effects are very impressive – even more so because generally I was caught up in the events rather than looking for the CGI work. Performances are surprisingly good; I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he is very good here. For the majority of the film he is not a hero or action-hero but rather an arrogant salesman (PR) and he lets us see his terror and confusion for the first half of the film – a key factor in drawing the viewer in. He does end up becoming a more traditional Cruise character, but he justifies getting there. Blunt is also good alongside him and is not just an attractive female sidekick. Support from Gleeson, Paxton, and those in J squad also helps build a convincing world and one that fits well the sci-fi genre without feeling like it is aping it.I watched this expecting it to be just a professional and expensive action movie and, while it of course is this, it is also a lot better than I expected. The use of humor, violence and action all help to make the concept work, drawing the viewer in really well so that when it does settle down to be more of what you expect, it still works because it already has you. A superior summer blockbuster.",Null,1,3,5 October 2014
Downfall," Gripping, moving and horrifying  again a war movie that just makes you wonder what the point of it all is
","In 1945 the second world war is coming to an end The German armies that once spread out all over Europe have been decimated and pushed back to the very heart of the German command in Berlin. Deep in his bunker, Hitler continues to rule with his group of generals, families and Traudl, his secretary. Awaiting armies that no longer exist and making plans that his generals are too scared to tell him are impossible, Hitler refuses to surrender as the streets and citizens of Berlin suffer between the remaining defending forces and the advancing Russian army. Gradually, as it becomes obvious that all is lost, the dream collapses and all that is left is death.A few months ago, a fellow user on this site asked me if I thought if Der Untergang was going to get nominated for an Oscar or not; I must admit that at the time I had not heard of it, but decided to see it if I got the chance. Of course it took me a few weeks to be in the mood for a long war movie that I knew was not going to have a good ending for anyone. When I went to see this film, the woman selling me my tickets asked if I knew it was a German film, I asked why it mattered and she said that they had had quite a few people leave the screening complaining about the fact it wasn't in English; doubtless these people then went into the next available screening of Be Cool (or whatever) and turned off their hearts and minds and just talked their way through the movie. Anyway, enough of my multiplex complaining, in fairness I did join a surprisingly full screening of this film and immediately got into it. The focus of the story was the bunker and it is compelling in its portrayal, with the cold emotion, the cruel sentiments and the utter pointlessness of the whole thing.The characters are not that well developed; they were never really people to me but they did enough to fit their roles within this story. That said, the whole story is compelling and it didn't matter that I didn't care for the characters as people because they were gripping to watch nonetheless. The film works well to paint the inanity of the whole thing but also cut in moments that are so cold that they almost made me shiver  for example, when Hitler is told of the loss of all the young officers, he simply replies 'that is what the young are for'. The film does not forget the people above ground and the scenes of destruction of Berlin are impacting  those who say that the civilians deserved it should see this and try to understand what they would have done in the situation; I am part of a country that went to war with Iraq, by that logic I deserve to have that country retaliate against me, even though I opposed the manner in which we did it.The acting is classy even though the characters are quite thin at times. Ganz is a great Hitler and gets it spot on throughout the film; however he does well not to dominate the film  his death (no spoiler there) doesn't stop the film because he was not what the film was all about. Lara is good although a bit too wide-eyed to convince; her real confessions at the end of the film are a bit too forgiving of her as a person but it does serve as a fair ending to the film. Harfouch and Matthes are cold and effective as the Goebbels' while the rest of the support cast all fit their roles well, with a good mix of opinions and approaches across the generals facing Hitler.Overall this is a good film although it is not an easy one to watch. The bunker scenes are cold and compelling even if the characters are broad historical reference points rather than people, meanwhile the attacks on Berlin are brutal and difficult to just watch without being moved. The manner in which the film ends is just as you'd expect, with nothing achieved but destruction by all of German's years before and during the war. The end credits remind us that 50 million people died during the war, including 6 million Jews and ethnic minorities systematically murdered  having seen the men who organised all this taking their own lives the main thing I felt was just how pointless and wasteful the whole thing had been and I left the film having 'enjoyed' the quality film but being utterly depressed by the world in which we live.",Null,24,32,19 April 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," High energy and wonderfully excessive as it delivers an engaging true story, but the lack of morality anywhere was a limiting factor
","This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us 'as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster' and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say 'so why not get on board'. I know this is not the case but the lack of a 'point' or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that 'it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself'. Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the 'it's all screwed so who cares' message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it.",Null,181,263,17 January 2014
Army of Darkness," Funny and cool!
","At the end of Evil Dead 2 Ash is sucked back in time through a time warp. He returns to medieval times where he is mistaken for the prophesied saviour.  He is sent to recover the lost Necronomicon to save the people but also return him to his own time.  Typically he makes a mistake when reading the book and he reserectes the army of the undead onto the land.  Ash must fight to defeat yet more undead fiends!The third in the series sees the gore drop off and the comedy step up even more.  The previous two were both darkly funny but this is just plain hilarious.  The sheer raft of one liners and silly/horror set ups keeps you laughing all the way.  The horror is not scary as before  mainly because the gore is gone, however I prefer this as the stop motion stuff gives it an old fashioned feel that adds to the value of it  it's hard to explain but I really enjoy this because it feels like an old Harryhausen film.Campbell is brilliant  I bet he can't believe hi s luck, the rest of his career he's struggled but Rami seem to love him.  And rightly so, he is like Jim Carrey but has so much more talent and is a classic B-movie leading man type.  The rest of the cast are so-so but really this is an one man show and he does it really well.Overall this is a great little film.  Fans of the series will love it, fans of comedy should love it and fans of B-movie cheese should enjoy it.  And the less gore means fun for all the family (almost).",Null,87,108,25 July 2002
The Last King of Scotland," The use of Garrigan is a strength and weakness but it is a good film thanks mainly to a terrific turn from Whitaker
","The newly qualified Dr Nicholas Garrigan travels to Uganda to take up a post with a village mission. He arrives just after a coup puts Idi Amin in power of the country. During a visit by Amim to the village, Garrigan captures the President's attention by tending to a small injury to his hand and showing himself decisive and strong-willed. It is not long before the young Garrigan finds himself appointed as physician to the President and ensconced as one of his 'closest advisors'. However the initial charm shown by Amin gives way to a darker violent streak as Garrigan finds the superficial stability of the country and its leader is nothing of the sort.Famous now for the performance that will deservedly win an Oscar in a few weeks time, this film actually doesn't have Amin as the 'main' character despite him being the draw and the title character. Instead we actually spend a lot of time with Garrigan, his experiences and his problems. Of course I understand why this was the way because Garrigan is out narrative device  a composite character who acts as our way into the inner circle of Amin and allows the audience to experience him as outsiders as well. This works well in doing this but it does also introduce problems, or at least one problem. This is the fact that, as the story goes on, we find ourselves more and more focused on Garrigan (who doesn't actually exist) rather than Amin or Uganda (who did and does exist respectively). I found this a bit irritating as it got worse because I had come to the film for Amin  as, I suspect, many will have done.Even with this though the film still works well and makes for an engaging piece. Macdonald's direction is good and his moving camera does give it the air of a documentary while still very much being a drama. Of course the thing that makes the film work is the central performance from Whitaker. The character of Amin allows him to play to his strengths and he delivers a convincingly unhinged turn, constantly menacing but also managing to have a child-like sense of fun at times and a terrifying tendency towards ruthlessness and violence. I have said before, he was brilliant in The Shield (making the whole season his own) and he is equally brilliant here. Alongside this it is no surprise that McAvoy is a bit weak by comparison. His character is not so convincing (a side effect of being a composite) and some of the narrative turns ask a lot of him  he is still good and it is not his fault that he is in Whitaker's shadow. Washington has a small role but was pretty good in it even if her presence made me wonder why they felt they had to cast an American actress, likewise Anderson but I assume that they helped get funding so fair enough. McBurney is a bit too slimy and sinister and I wasn't sure what the film was trying to say. Audiences may also recognise Oyelowo from his recent high-profile roles in HBO's Five Days and BBC's controversial Shoot The Messenger.Overall then not a perfect film but a pretty good one. The use of Garrigan is good at getting us into the story but it is a weakness that we stick with him as the focus. The performances are roundly good but of course it is another terrific turn from Whitaker that makes every scene he is in worth seeing.",Null,7,8,17 February 2007
Scream 2," Not as clever as it thinks it is
","With the original murders now made into a best selling book and film, someone on campus begins to kill in the same way as before. As Sidney's (Campbell) friends begin to die off suspicion seems to point to all those round her.I didn't really like the first Scream - I thought it was clever but that it revelled in it's own cruelty. Here the same problems exist. This wants to be a teen slasher movie but also be clever and look down it's nose at other slashers. It starts with the movie within a movie and uses that to make jokes out of all the things that were thrown at it first time round - causing real life violence, having no black people etc and of course it gets to discuss the rules for horror sequels and make fun of those. My problem with this is that it wants to laugh at slasher movies but also do the very things it's laughing at. This may be good once but twice and the joke wears thin, also when it is dealing with real-life issues rather than film 'rules' it is harder to swallow and misses the mark.For example Jada Pinkett derides the film Stab for being 'a white film' and having 'no black people' etc, just like the first Scream. But you get the feeling that this joke is a sore spot because now we have several black leads in the film even when a group of white sorority girls are onscreen they will contain a token black character. The colour shouldn't be an issue, but by pointing it out and then ensuring that Scream 2 has plenty it makes you think all the black actors are there jut to make up a quota. It's the same in other areas - the opening murders in the cinema are meant to make us look at this crowd enjoying on-screen murder watch as Pinkett is killed. We're supposed to see how macabre it is that the audience loves the onscreen violence and then see how abhorrent Pinkett's terror-filled gruesome death is.....but then we (the audience) sit and get entertained by the violence and killing that follows. I do feel that the film can't have it both ways - say 'look at this isn't it terrible' and proceed to do just what it was making fun of.If horror is your thing then this is quite good. It has plenty of scares and jumps but it is just too cruel to be entertaining - it seems to not take fun from the excitement or the horror but from the sheer cruelty of the murders. It's not as scary as the first and most of the time you know what's going to happen - which is why the film ups the gore and cruelty of the killings - to give us something new and interesting. Outside of this the plot is funny at times but it isn't as self-referential as before. The best bits involve in-jokes among the cast such as Cox's character responding to nude internet pictures of her by saying it was just her head put onto Jennifer Anniston's body. But for the most part the mystery plot is silly and you do just sit and watch good-looking teens get picked off for 2 hours. The eventual twist is stupid - as one of the characters says 'Wow! What a twist! bet you didn't see that coming!' Well, no - but only because the twist is so unpredictable that it's stupid. The film spends so much time making all the characters look suspicious and putting EVERYONE in a situation where they could be the killer, only to then go and do that!The original cast all return with the addition of several black faces to even it up (Pinkett, Epps, Elise Neal and others) and a few famous TV faces (Buffy's Gellar, Ally McBeal's Portia de Rossi, Laurie Metcalf) all do well as the killer's victims. The film appears to be more carefree about killing it's main cast but bottles it at the end and makes sure it's got enough left over for a sequel. David Arquette and his wife have the most fun but other leads such as Gellar and Campbell just run around screaming with not much else to do until they die or confront the killer. Sad that the most beautiful woman in this only lasts 5 minutes (Pinkett) before being dispatched, Omar Epps deserved more than he got as well - but I guess the film isn't quite as equal opps as it would like to think.Overall a horror movie that replaces scares with cruelty and insults us all by making us think that we can figure it all out before screwing us with an ending that comes out of nowhere. The cast were not shown the ending until the end of shooting but I feel that if they had they wouldn't have been able to rehearse with a straight face.",Null,0,7,21 November 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A rich telling near the source material
","Opening with his vow to rise from his grave and take revenge on a God who allowed his beloved to die while he defended Him on the battlefield, we see Count Dracula in the 1890's, conducting business with a London firm.  When his first consultant goes mad, Jonathon Harker is sent to Dracula in his place, only to find himself trapped in the castle.  Meanwhile, Dracula travels to London where he feeds on the lovely Lucy Westenra.  Her various suitors try to help her and call for Professor Van Helsing to come and help  they realise that this is not a simple battle against a disease of the blood.Although a little too long for my liking, this film is a very rich gothic telling of a story that has become watered down slightly with the many different versions of stories with the characters.  Here the basic plot follows the tale from the creation of Dracula, his love and his confrontation with Van Helsing and the various suitors of the lovely Lucy. The story is told with a real respect for the source, perhaps a little too much as it can be a little to heavy and lacking in spark at times.  However, for the most part the gothic telling works very well and feels very lavish and rich.Visually the film is great  rich colours in the scenery and costumes really bring the goth out of the film.  Meanwhile Coppola works well with shadows and images in the backgrounds to make the film have the feel of an old silent movie version (eyes in the storm) but with modern standards.  It's not really scary, but I didn't need it to be, I was more interested in the overall story, and that worked well.The cast suffer from a bit too much respect for the material, some of their performances are a little too hammy and heavy.  Oldman is good when compared to the better known image of the `Bela Lagosi' Dracula, but I did still find him a little too hammy at times.  Likewise Rider is not totally convincing. Hopkins is quite fun to watch and the three suitors (including Ewles and Grant) very much play stiff upper lipped straight men!  Of course of their performances tower with majesty above the sheer miscast ineptitude of Reeves.  From the start his accent is horrid, but his inability to bring out emotions and character basically kills his character off before the film has even got going.Despite this the film is actually very enjoyable even if it is a bit too respectful and long  occasionally making it feel a little heavy going.  The rich presentation and loyalty to the source material makes for a very enjoyable story even if it isn't really what we'd see now as a horror.",Null,60,98,14 November 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Great entry into a great series
","Someone calling himself Simon detonates several bombs in the centre of New York City.  He then sets a series of dangerous tasks for Officer John McClane to achieve or he will detonate more.  McClane sets out to meet the demands of the terrorists with bystander Zeus Carver in tow.This is the third in the Die Hard series and it makes an immediate improvement on the second by bringing back the original director John McTiernan.  Here the film doesn't try to repeat the formula of the first film (terrorists/wife/rescue) but instead takes on a whole new plot while still tying it into the first film.  The second movie tried to repeat the first film's plot but set in an airport, here the different angle makes this feel a lot fresher and feel like a movie in itself.  The tie-in to the first film is clever and not too much of a stretch of the imagination - happily this is not the reason for the action itself - instead the terrorist's main aim is the gold held in vaults in the Federal Reserve on Wall Street, but the game with McClane is a special treat.McTiernan was great in the first film, making everything feel tense and claustrophobic.  Here he has the whole of NYC to run across and the camera shows this new found freedom.  In action scenes the camera swings wildly round and zooms into focus on the action.  During scenes set in offices etc containing a lot of dialogue the camera slowly prowls round like it's dieing to rush off to the next action scene.  It's the opposite to the style in the first film and again makes this feels different enough to be a film in it's own right.Usually film series can get a lot of baggage (watch Lethal Weapon 4 for proof), but here all the repeat characters are dropped, even McClane's wife only features as a voice on the phone.  And that works well here and the only characters that are brought back here are McClane (of course) and Hans Gruber (in a flashback).  This frees the film up to basically go where it wants without having to squeeze in old characters the way the second film did.  However it links the films by having Simon Gruber taking supposed revenge for the death of his brother.  The fresh active feel to this movie really gives it life and lifts the series out of the hole that the second film had threatened to put it.The chemistry between Willis and Jackson is great and lends a lot of comedy to the film, there's lot of racial humour between the two and Jackson is more than the 'black sidekick' that exists in many films.  Irons continues the fine tradition of English actors playing Hollywood villains and is good for the most.  His ticks and stutters stop him being anywhere near as good as Rickman was in the original role but he's still good.  Willis gets good support from the likes of Graham Greene, Larry Bryggman and Colleen Camp as fellow cops but really him and Jackson carry the show.Some of the scenes are a little forced and the plot doesn't always join together easily (a scene where Willis is fired out of a water pipe just as Jackson happens to drive by is a little too convenient) but many iffy bits can be overlooked if you focus on the action.  The most effective thing that returns from the first film is the musical score.  In the first film the score used variations on Christmas music to dramatic effect, here the score uses music well to add tension and comedy in a different way.  It's difficult to put into words but this effect was missing from the second film.The film has a hatful of nice twists towards the end and the only problem is that the conclusion in Canada doesn't feel like it fits in (the original ending was changed following the Okalahoma bombing) but this is a minor problem in a film that is a great addition to the action packed Die Hard series.",Null,45,60,28 November 2001
"Hail, Caesar!"," In many ways should have been stronger, but is still good fun if you like the Coens' work
","This film seemed to get quite a mixed response when it came out, and watching for myself I can understand why. On one hand it is a light bit of fun, which is professionally delivered in all aspects; however at the same time it always feels like it could easily have been more than this – and maybe could have delivered more along the lines of other Coen brother films. How strongly you feel about this will depend on the individual; for me I fell between the two stools.As a comedy I enjoyed it. It had smart dialogue and characters, all with plenty of color and atmosphere. At the same time the film looked great from the cinematography through to the cast involved. This did work against it for me too then; mainly because it seemed to always harken back to other films such as Barton Fink, and other better films. This feeling is confirmed because Hail Caesar! is at its best in the moment, but doesn't really build or develop into something more satisfying. It is still funny, very well delivered, and enjoyable as part of the familiar Coen world, but they have done better, and it is hard not to think that while watching this.",Null,1,1,18 September 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A silly but funny collection of sketches featuring the character of Burgundy (with a vague narrative in there somewhere)  some miss but most hit
","Before the years of cable, the local news station was the main place people got their news and, because of that, the news anchorman was king. In San Diego, the number one anchorman was Ron Burgundy. Every inch the 70's man, Ron is on the top of his game, partying and getting the ladies with his all-male news team. However things are changing and a woman is brought in to bring diversity to the channel 4 team. Unable to bed her and move on, Ron becomes fascinated with Veronica to the point where he begins to love her. However when Veronica makes it clear that her ambition is to one day be an anchor. Will their competition get in the way of Ron's first ever feeling of love?After enjoying the silly humour of Dodgeball, I decided (along with an audience of 8 others) to give Anchorman a go. Immediately the film sets out its stall with a serious, very seventies narration that puts us right in the world of the Anchorman. After a few scenes out 'plot' is presented to us in the form of Ron initial rebuttal by Veronica; from this point on the film follows the vague flow of their competition and their romance  however to call it a plot is to be rather too kind to it. Instead the film is best viewed as a collection of sketches featuring one character, all strung together with one vague theme. This is because the funniest bits of the film are often the bits that are very imaginative and off the wall where often it is the actual story that creates the misses and the periods where I wasn't laughing a great deal.Of course, many people will know before they see it if they will like it or not, because the cast have done so many films recently it is easy to get a handle on their sense of humour. For my money I like it and I enjoyed the film even if I did feel that it didn't have much of a story and had quite a few segments that just didn't work as well as the majority. The imaginatively silly script is great fun and gave me plenty of good laughs whether in the form of silly entire sequences (the anchor rumble) or just the silly characters all around the place. Of these, some are poorly judged and are silly without being funny (Champ) but mostly they get the mix just right (Brick is spot on). The manic humour mostly hits though  and even spills over into the end credits where a 'Smokey & The Bandit 2' moment had me laughing due to its sheer unexpected nature.The cast is deep and are a major part of the film winning  everyone is pretty much 'on' and covers the fact that the central narrative is nowhere near good enough on its own. Ferrell is as funny as ever, but his character is an one-note deal and, even if he plays it well (which he does) it isn't enough to fill a film. So thank goodness then for a support cast that features inspired lunacy in both the cameos and the main cast. Koechner is a bit boring, while Rudd is simple but still fun in some ways but it is Carell who pretty much gets the biggest laugh every time he does anything. Applegate plays it pretty straight but also gets some laughs  she is always eclipsed by those around her but she did good work anyway. The cameos come thick and fast and, although they could have been distracting but actually they all work pretty well. As ever Vaughn, Stiller and Wilson all show up and are good but the cameos also include good turns from Black, Robbins, Pyle, Trejo and a funny dog.The film contains scenes of rather surprising animal cruelty and also violence to women but, while this may rightly be a major issue for some viewers I was laughing at the time and chose to take it all in the spirit it was intended. Overall the film is very funny in a very manic way but some will not like the misses that mostly come from a poorly developed story. When it is funny it will take you by surprise and make you laugh hard but when it misses it does so in a very obvious manner. Mostly though this is a very funny film  but come prepared for a story so bitty that this could have been called 'Anchorman: The Best of Ron Burgundy'.",Null,2,6,26 September 2004
American Gangster," A strange but effective mix of 'movie gangster epic' and The Wire which produces more strengths than weaknesses (but does produce both)
","Having spent over a decade as Bumpy Johnson's driver, Frank Lucas looks to step up into the gap following his death. Looking to avoid the glitz and publicity of his peers, Lucas makes a connection in the Far East after seeing a news article on the abundance of drugs and its impact on US soldiers. Using military aircraft to transport the goods, Lucas enlists his family and trusted associates to put a cheaper but higher quality product onto the streets, quickly dominating the market  his low profile meaning he avoids the traps of dirty cops and investigations. Meanwhile clean, but deeply unpopular cop Richie Roberts is allowed to put together a small unit to look into the source of the new wave of drugs.I do like my crime dramas and it seemed obvious to me that I would enjoy American Gangster given the calibre of people involved in it and, watching it last night, I must say that I did find it a satisfying and enjoyable film. The pace is comparatively slow but yet the story comes over as packed  not busy to the point of being hustle and bustle but more just constantly engaging and interesting. Based on a true story, the film seems in no particular rush and I did respect this in the delivery as it allowed me room to be involved in the telling rather than it trying to constantly hold my attention with action or loud noises. Of course some viewers will feel the absence of these stimuli more than I did but for me it worked.I was surprised by how uncinematic it felt though. Considering the sweep and scale of the last Crowe/Scott film (Gladiator), American Gangster is remarkably absent of visual flair. As other reviewers have commented it did have the feel of an episode of The Wire in how 'matter of fact' it was. Of course to me there can be no higher compliment than being compared to that HBO series and personally I had no problem with this approach despite it feeling a little odd on a large screen. The cast fill that same screen though and the film is deep in names all giving solid performances or better. Washington plays his character out well while Crowe contrasts with him nicely in individual and shared scenes. Neither has a lot in the way of character development beyond the obvious but the overall approach of the film made this less important than it otherwise would have been. Supporting these two are too many people to discuss within IMDb's word limit. Ejiofor, Brolin, Levine, Common, RZA, Gooding Jr, Assante, TI, Morton and of course The Wire's own Elba all turn in supporting roles among other faces; although it should be said that anyone enamoured with Elba's Stringer Bell as I am will be disappointed with his smaller, simpler character here. If anything the cast is almost too deep as it did distract at times to be constantly thinking 'that's the guy from etc' but in terms of quality it is hard to really complaint.As I said I had no real problem with Scott's visual style and restrained 'factual' delivery but in a way it could have done with learning some lessons from Scorsese. By this I specifically mean the use of music. The tracks are all great but they are not so much 'used' as they are 'played'. Goodfellas is a great example of how to use music and somehow this film just did even try to compare  indeed even choosing some tracks that were only ever going to put the viewer in mind of another film (eg Across 110th Street from Jackie Brown). All told though I did appreciate the gritty and unflashy approach of the film as it did suit the manner of the telling.So a strange but effective mix then. In a way it carries itself like a classic gangster tale suggesting that it sits up there with Godfather and Goodfellas. But then in other ways it channels The Wire's 'matter of fact' and unflashy style to deliver an engaging and convincing story that is well delivered by all. Somehow the mix works for the greater good even if it also produces some downsides to both. Not the perfect classic that some reviews would have you believe but certainly a solid and roundly strong product that is worth seeing for many reasons.",Null,7,11,28 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Restrained and creative film even if it doesn't totally capture or convince in the emotional core
","Harold Crick is a simple man who is very much a creature of habit. He brushes his teeth the same way each day, hurries to the bus and always narrowly catches it on his way to his job as an auditor for the IRS. This morning is different though because Harold appears to be hearing voices  or rather one voice  narrating what he is doing as he does it. Unsure whether he is crazy or not, he is in no doubt the more it goes on and the use of a certain phrase in relation to his impending death causes Harold to urgently get to the bottom of it while all the time life carries on around him.When this film was released I didn't bother with it because it did seem like 'one of those clever-clever' films that are all very clever but perhaps not that great when you strip away the cleverness to the main plot. Certainly the one line summary (man finds his life being narrated by unseen author) did suggest that there would be a lot of the gimmick in this. When it arrived on television recently I did think that I should at least not assume things about it and instead let it tell me what it is like. What I found was a film that was slightly too clever for its own good but does have a heart in there somewhere as well as several other commendable aspects.The 'gimmick' (or device I guess) does create a solid character plot and I was drawn in by this initially and throughout. This side of it does work right up to the end. Beyond this we do have a story of Harold discovering more to his life than he had been living and also some things about the nature of living, creating and dying. Unfortunately it is this part of the film that is not totally successful because it doesn't come over as sure of itself and while it has its moments it doesn't flow thematically as well as I wanted. What this meant was that I didn't end up as emotionally involved in Harold or the story as I felt I should have been; the cleverness of it was never in doubt but this never slipped into the background to reveal a real strong heart  even if it did have heart. The 'cleverness' of the script should not be ignored though (unless of course, you are the Academy Awards, then by all means just ignore it) and I did find delight in the creative idea and delivery. The dialogue is charming and engaging and it is picked up well by the cast.Ferrell appears to be happy just doing sports spoof after sports spoof at the moment (the ABA being the most recent target) and perhaps this is because he feels he has proved he can act with this film. Certainly his performance is very strong here and he does it by being completely restrained throughout, bringing out much with small changes and actions. He is not good enough to 'make' the film in the emotional sense but he is quietly impressive. Gyllenhaal is colourful even if she does easily get a bit sappy without totally convincing me later on. Thompson is nicely eccentric and she works her limited scenes well while Queen Latifah at very least deserves mention for not being a screaming cliché like she normally is and is happy in a minor role. Hoffman is also a good find and rounds out a starry cast, all of whom are content to do quiet, good work on the edges while Ferrell does the same in the lead. Forster's direction is mostly very good with plenty of good shots and composure but I'm not sure why the film had animation on some scenes showing numbers etc  it seemed to be half done and stuck out as such, like they didn't have the confidence to totally do what they wanted but still wanted to have it in there.Overall though, the film is clever, creative and engaging. It doesn't totally manage to deliver on the emotional aspect of the story and characters but it does an OK job anyway. The performances are roundly strong, with Ferrell showing a restraint and subtlety that I wish he could find projects for more often. The 'clever-clever' aspect is also restrained and controlled to prevent it ever disappearing up itself in the way some of these things do, although it is worth keeping in mind that if this type of film annoys you then you should probably check out now.",Null,0,0,28 May 2008
The Green Mile," Overlong and too worthy but still a good story  just don't expect it to be anything like Shawshank 2!
","Now a resident in a rest home, one time head warden on death row, Paul Edgecomb, is struggling with his untold memories.  When a film brings it all back to him he recounts the story of the time when a huge black prisoner called John Coffey was put into wing.  It is not too long before the peaceful, loving prisoner, found guilty of the rape and murder of two children, has mysterious gifts that transcend the decay of the lives around the prison.After Shawskank Redemption I was attracted to this as many of the makers were the same not to mention the author, the prison setting and the running time.  However that same running time and some negative reviews put me off and I didn't get round to seeing it till recently.  The film is very slow and this is occasionally to it's detriment but not too often.  It's main failing is that it's supernatural spin makes it difficult to get involved and lose yourself in completely.  `Redemption's ` strength was that it was a human story.  Green Mile tries to have the strength of human spirit at it's core but it doesn't quite come off.That's not to say that the story still isn't moving and involving because it is.  However it doesn't come as easily as it should and when the story slows a little bit it does feel slow.  It could easily have lost 30 minutes as at it's current  length it feels like a long movie which is a bad thing  Two Towers is long but didn't FEEL long!  Also something I always find annoying is when a score really works the emotion where the actual film can't manage it by itself  here the score is working overtime to wring every drop of emotion from the scenes.The film is very well directed and there are powerful moments of cruelty. When the chair is used I couldn't help but feel that it was real.  However the main attraction (other than the mouse!) is a wonderful performance by Duncan.  True there is an element of slave cliché about it but he rises above that a gives a performance of such emotion and such gentleness that came as a surprise from someone of his build.  Hanks is also good and wisely plays it quite low-key and the support cast is solid, comprised of many many well known faces including Morse and Cromwell.Overall this is good but overlong.  It is a very different film from Shawshank and many will compare it to that much better film.  However the film is worth the work despite some simplistic errors and flaws.",Null,14,35,8 March 2003
The Reader," An OK film with interesting aspects and good performances but lacking in the total delivery
","The Awards season always generates buzz and also means the sudden release of lots of worthy and good films all at about the same time. Of course this doesn't mean that all of them are good and just because some have hype for acting reasons does not mean that the film itself will be good, vice versa and so on. Coming to The Reader, the viewer already has pressure on them  the film is one of these contenders for awards, it has some heavy-weight performances and it is about a typically worthy subject in the Holocaust. The pressure to be overwhelmed and deeply moved by it is there for all to see  some say films will make heavy plays for Oscar but they do the same for the audience. The reality is not always so (both for the Oscars and for the audience). With The Reader the film is very much on the back of the actors and I left with the impression that that's all it had in its bag.The story is a reasonably interesting twist on the Holocaust drama as it is seen in retrospect through a case convicting those who worked at the death camps, with a focus on Hanna. We meet her via the teenage Michael and for the majority of the film we know nothing more than her love of being read to and their sexual relationship. It offers the potential for exploration of guilt, of personal responsibility, of morality in the face of a mob mindset, of forgiveness  all of these are here to be had and the cast suggested that the script must really do this, hence their involvement. The thing is that the film doesn't manage to do this to any significant degree. The first half of the film spends far too long on the relationship between Michael and Hanna, because it has nowhere near enough to do with it and it ends up slightly dull as it goes along.The second half is the guts of the film where secrets come out, things are confronted and issues are on the table for moral debate, whether within the characters or in the group of law students who seemingly exist to allow this debate to occur. Here is where my doubts over the film manifested themselves in proper, if slight, disappointment. The second half, you see, is interesting. That's it. Interesting. It is not challenging, it is not impacting, it is not moving and it is not thoughtful. I honestly no idea why it failed to really punch home on any of these because at times the concept and the characters make it feel like an open goal of sorts. It is a disappointment when all's said and done but thanks to the cast it does still engage to a point.Everyone is good. Winslet gets the praise and rightly so as hers is a difficult and complex character. That she gets so much out of it when the material does want to explore her very much as part of the narrative is to her credit. Kross works alongside her very well, with a strong performance that matches her in so much as the material needs him to. Fiennes is a good future character and I liked what he did despite having the challenge of remoteness from the majority of the film and also little screen time. The problem is that everyone is good enough to make me yet again be bothered by how the script is not better so that they may have had more to work with.The Reader is a big worthy film with big worthy names giving big worthy performances. Problem is that it doesn't do half as much as it should with the subject. The concept is fine and the cast deliver it with all they can but yet the material fails to deliver a really thoughtful piece full of debate and impact  the way it is set up suggests it was going to be all about this but instead it is only an OK film with interesting aspects and good performances but lacking in the total delivery.",Null,4,8,20 February 2009
Jaws," A lesson in tension
","Who'd have thought that such a simple idea could be a film of such amazing impact, even decades later.  It is a testament to Spielberg's directing abilities that this film still creates deep seated phobias in those that watch it!Essentially a remake of Duel except with a shark replacing the truck this is a lesson in suspense for directors.  With special effects now the audience tend to see everything in glorious colour - not much is left to the imagination.  With Jaws we only see the fin, movements under water or the impact of the attack - the shark remains hidden until the end.  This is the best option as it is very rubbery looking, but it also heightens the tension as the unknown moves under water to attack us.Roy Scheider is excellent as Chief Brody with great support from Dreyfuss and Shaw.  The chemistry between the Dreyfuss and Scheider is perfect and Shaw is as tetchy as he needs to be.  The dialogue is spot on in many scenes and has become part of the common knowledge of the world - being spoofed in films included Lethal Weapon 3, Chasing Amy to name two.Later remade as Jurassic Park (!) this is a classic piece of tension. Ignore the rubber shark effects towards the end and sit back and marvel at what a master director can do with a simple story and basic effects.",Null,8,13,17 October 2001
The Wrestler," Not as perfect a film as is being said, but a great character study that subverts the sports genre to be suitably drab and real (which is a compliment)
","After the imagination and creativity shown in The Fountain, The Wrestler initially strikes the viewer as a bit of a disappointment because director Darren Aronofsky appears to have gone to the other extreme of style and has delivered a film that is very much in the real world, with no flights of fancy and no real visual flair to it. However in the same way as The Fountain was about the heart of the central male character, The Wrestler is the same, just with a totally different character struggling with a totally different set of emotions. As a faded wrestler, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson is living in a trailer park where he can barely keep up the rent, during the week he works a manual job in the stock room of a local supermarket and at weekends he dons his costume and takes part in wrestling events in small and only partially filled leisure centres and halls.The nature of the character has been talked to death already, mainly because of the actor playing him and how good his performance is, but Randy is a fairly simplistic character on paper. Indeed the whole film has a very simple concept right down to the 'stripper with the heart of gold', and in different hands this would have been more uplifting than it is but then also less realistic and less interesting. As it is The Wrestler delivers a singularly grim depiction of a man unsure of what to do in life and clinging to the buzz he still gets performing in front of the dwindling crowds even though the personal cost of this is clear in every part of his life. It is almost documentarian in its approach and often the camera is following Randy rather than moving in such a way to inform the viewer (although it does this as well). This makes the film feel very bleak and, like Randy himself, perhaps that it is not really going to go anywhere. Those still looking for a big redemption or sporting achievement have been watching too many generic sports movie and have not been paying attention to the way this is being told.So what is it about the visually 'straight' delivery and grimy and very downbeat story that makes this film worth seeing? Well, the awards chatter will already have told you that because what makes it is the performances that bring the film to life. Without these Aronofsky's twisting of the sports genre looking at faded male hopes would have been an interesting but quite dull affair and I think he knows this which is why his focus is so much on the characters. Much has been made of the parallels between Rourke and his character but such commentary detracts from his performance, which is great. It is not in one dialogue scene or one specific thing he does, but Rourke manages to utterly convince as Randy in his mannerism, the way he carries himself, the small moments of joy he has, the look he has in his eyes and the pain (physical and emotional) that his life has brought him to. That there isn't a clear 'Oscar clip' is a sign of how good it is because it is not something he 'delivers' so much as 'is'. The same could be said for Tomei, although again some have detracted from her turn by focusing on the fact that her body is fantastic (which admittedly it is; not 'for her age'  just fantastic). She doesn't have as much time to shine but she becomes more impressive when you consider that, on paper, her character is a real cliché that is like a direct shadow of Randy in terms of situation (aging out of the only world she knows). That she makes it better than this is down to how much she gets out of her eyes and face. They work well together but she does feel like she is acting whereas Rourke convinces totally.Despite what the voters on this site say (the 60th best film EVER! Really?) The Wrestler is not a great film that will blow you away at any point. Indeed I think many people will be surprised by how slow and slightly drab it is. However where it is strongest is in the area it sets out to be all about  a character study. This aspect works thanks to Aronofsky sticking close to his subjects even if it is grim or dull and by getting great performances from the two central performers. As a total film then, I thought it was good but not great and that it has benefited generally from how good Rourke is in it. Worth seeing but don't let the hype mislead you into expecting something that The Wrestler never pertains to be.",Null,9,13,23 January 2009
Hancock," Fun and interesting for the first part - messy and uneven in the second (SPOILERS)
","Like all decent American cities, Los Angeles has its own superhero it can call upon for help when things get bad. Unfortunately for the city, their hero is a John Hancock - a drunk, homeless, @sshole who does more damage than good when he 'helps'. This could all change though whenever he saves the live of PR man Ray Embrey, who in return offers to help improve the public image of Hancock.Everyone has already said it but I will repeat it here by saying that half of Hancock is a really good film but unfortunately the second half doesn't deliver on this. For the first third/half of the film the concept is that which was marketed - a 'superhero' who is also essentially a jerk. This produces a few laughs and a quite interesting idea that is a welcome change from the effects-heavy summer films where the heroes battle one another with effects being the focus at the expense of plot. However, the film does not carry on down this road for long before the 'plot' kicks in.Now for me I thought the 'plot' was going to be the same as the '@sshole hero' plot but seemingly not. Instead we have some nonsense rushed out about the paired immortals and a gang of bank robbers who are important in terms of the conclusion but otherwise make no sense at all. It is a shame because the end result is a film that is an uneven mess, despite having good points. The comedy is what I was looking for but it moves too quickly from this into CGI nonsense, plots about immortals and a conclusion that is forced to be too dramatic for characters I have hardly come to care about and comes before I had time to get used to the 'new' tone of the second half.The film is a Smith vehicle and he is one of the few stars that can still open a film. In the better moments of the film he is very good (ie before Mary reveals herself) but in the second half he is let down by the film; so although he does get his character and the emotions right, the problems with the material mean he wastes his time. Theron is so-so and overdoes her part in the first half with her not-so-subtle looks and comments, before inexplicably becoming a vamp to show that she has powers too. Bateman is his skillful comic self when dealing with Smith in the first half of the film but by the end I was surprised by how little use the film made of him. Head is a typical annoying kid, while Marsan's villain is too obvious - although he is not helped by the total lack of background to his character.Given I have said it about twenty times already, you will probably have got that I think this is a film of two halves. The first is not perfect but it is funny and nice to see a major blockbuster subvert the genre in this way (not that it is the first film to do it). However the sudden change of gear in the middle is jarring and the film never recovers from it, not that it helps itself by the jumps in logic and convenient narrative steps, none of which work. Almost a good film but the longer it goes on, the lesser it becomes.",Null,1,7,11 September 2008
Kong: Skull Island," Enjoyably distracting monster movie
","Looking back at old movies, the effects date quickly and they become rather cheesy in their simple pleasures. Someday I will do that with this film, because essentially it is a creature feature, albeit one that happens to be being delivered with the biggest stars, biggest budget, and state-of-the-art effects. And the thing is, despite all this superficial polish, the film is essentially big monsters and spectacle.On this front it is enjoyable though; it has plenty of action, lots to look at, and a reasonably successful mix of humor and drama. I say reasonably, because the plot isn't up to much, and different characters seem to be in different films depending on who they are. This is matched by the performances which range from the silly fun (Reilly) to the stupidly OTT (Jackson) to the starry but bland (Hiddleston, Larson); the film doesn't seem to have a handle on what it wants to do, and the mix that it produces is not always successful, and it relies on big moments of action and noise to try and cover it. Perhaps at some point there was some smart commentary about US foreign policy in there, but that is lost in the mix too.Still, it works as a monster movie with great effects and lots of polish, so enjoy it for that even if there is not too much beyond that.",Null,1,1,30 July 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Fairly consistent action carries it along, even if there is little to it and even impacting moments are lessened by the relentlessness
","Perhaps it is me getting older but I do wonder if I was too kind on the original Lord of the Rings films in light of how disappointed I had been with the Hobbit films. Maybe because it was all new and different, or maybe they were genuinely better films than these. Anyway, as the Company continues their mission, so too did I return for the conclusion of this trilogy; although it must be said that I did not rush to it or have a great deal of excitement. The cliff- hanger from the previous film did win me over though, plus I wanted to see it through.The opening sequence picking up on Smaug's attack on the town turned out to be pretty impressive; okay we still have people surviving impossible special effects, but Smaug was a strong part of the previous film and remained so here. There is a feeling of anti- climax after this sequence finishes, but the story continues and builds reasonably well as we see the various armies position themselves (albeit many seem to be able to appear by magic at the drop of a hat). With various action sequences this leads us into many fight sequences with lots of movements and CGI. All of this is reasonably okay but it never seems to stop, and gradually I found myself sort of numbed by it. I think it was the ongoing lack of consequence and depth to it all that did it, because technically it all does look impressive but yet it feels very much like a video game too many times.The feeling of lack of consequence was a surprise to me though, particularly since we had major characters dying – so in theory that should be a surprise and an impact. Unfortunately for me and the film, most of these are hurt by me frankly not being that engaged with some of these characters and their specific stories, while the delivery of these moments tended to be overly done, so they didn't have a genuine impact so much as a melodramatic one. With the battles I also found that the film didn't seem to convey the sense of scale it should have done. It produces plenty of crowd shots and sweeping cameras, but most fights seem very small and disconnected from the bigger picture; they still work for what they are, but they felt like the film was smaller by virtue of them.The cast are mixed but mainly everyone does what they do behind heavy costume and make-up, and with lots of green-screen work. The problem is more that the most interesting characters generally don't get the most time – in particular it was a shame that Freeman did not get enough to do considering how good he was throughout. Armitage is good as Thorin, but mostly people were a blur of ears and facial hair (depending on their race). Lilly and Bloom were the ones that stuck in the mind for the wrong reasons – I found them dull.So the trilogy ends and being honest I am not too sad to see it go. As a film there is probably enough action and dramatics to carry it through the time, but at the same time this is the issue with it. The relentless CGI-heavy action wore me down somewhat, and as I didn't really engage with the story due to the previous films, it was hard to do much here even if some of the specifics offered hope. It is solidly good enough for fans to feel they finished out the story with a bang, but for me it was another very expensive and technologically impressive so-so film in the trilogy.",Null,5,8,18 January 2015
Hitch," Not great but enjoyable, mainly thanks to the charismatic performances from all
","Alex Hitchens has a skill with women and he earns his very comfortable living by helping men through the first three dates with the women of their choice  no matter how unattainable they are. He doesn't do it so the men can 'win' but instead to help the women see the man inside, passed all the dorky mannerisms and social failings they may have. He only works by recommendations and he keeps a low profile. With his latest client, Albert, he is trying to help fix him up with the famous Allegra Cole, while he himself is trying to win over reporter Sara  the former surprisingly going better than the latter. However Alex couldn't see how the two relationships would end up affecting his whole business.When a star really pushes the boat out to try and promote his movie, you do have to wonder how good the film actually is. So when Will Smith turned up on Broad Street in Birmingham as part of 4 UK premiers in one day I did think that perhaps nobody trusted the reviews to be able to sell this film on its own merits. However I finally relented and give it a try and found it to be quite an enjoyable little comedy  nothing special but having just enough wit and charm to fill the time. The plot is very thin and goes to the conclusion that you always knew it would but yet somehow it is still enjoyable. This may be down to the script which as plenty of small laughs along the way and gets good mileage out of introducing us to Hitch's world and working with Albert while also developing the stuff with Sara. It isn't rocket science but it does work.What really helps is that the cast are all into it and have enough charisma to choke a horse. Smith leads the affair with his usual swagger but is still confident enough to have his image punctured at times to the benefit of the film. He seems to mix really well with both his co-stars. Mendes looks sexy and sassy throughout and her energy helps to make more of her character. James may be just another fat man in a comedic role but he works with his basic tools well and is quite funny at turns. Valletta is quite enjoyable in a smaller role while faces like Arkin, Donovan and Rapaport fill out the cast list despite not having a great deal to do. Nobody is brilliant but the lead three do have enough charm to cover up for the fact that the material is just rather ho-hum for the majority.Overall then an enjoyable but unspectacular rom-com that does nothing new but at least has energy and charm. The cast do well to get mileage out of the concept while the writers have done enough to stop it sagging too often. Genre fans will enjoy it of course but its charm and broad humour will make it a nice, if forgettable, experience for the casual viewer.",Null,2,4,11 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Typical summer blockbuster, it is. Lacking detail, subtlety, performances and strong writing, it is. Impressed, I wasn't.
","Star Wars was the film that pretty much created the blockbuster, tie-ins, merchandising, so it is no surprise to find that this one has all the strengths and weaknesses that we have come to associate with blockbusters. Specifically the issue that it is all noise and CGI without as much heart and good writing as would normally be required. Visually, this film will be a treat to those looking at the film on that level because it is like CGI overload  Lucas appears afraid to just have simple scenes so even personal moments in Padme's room have wide windows with constant movement behind them. On a technical it is impressive but it detracts from the story, which was what I went for, and it just ended up distracting and rather unnecessary. In the UK, one part of our terrorism laws prevents suspects using computers; at times I felt that perhaps the same measure should be taken against Lucas, to force him to focus on things other than effects.If you are just looking for action to wash over you with lots of pretty colours then this should do you, for me though even the action scenes were pretty uninvolving. Last week I saw Ong Bak  which drew a real reaction from the audience; with Sith, the audience just sat back and tried to keep up with it. It had its moments but it was never gripping or exciting. Part of this may be down to the fact we all know what will happen (we may not know the detail but we already know the outcomes) but this should have been a strength of the film because the script could've done much more with the material  making it tragic, clever, insightful and moving. Sadly it doesn't do any of these particularly well even if it has a go at all of them in some ways.Firstly, the story is not really developed past the very basic blocks that it skips over; hence Anakin's fall is rather obvious and lacking the complex inner turmoil that should have been there. In fact his turning is so simple and so easily explained that it almost makes Anakin look, well, gullible and weak willed rather than the imposing Vader we will know later. The script occasionally links to Bush's policy in Iraq but I think this was more by chance than anything else and as a result it doesn't really do anything clever or interesting with it other than just put it on the screen. Of course the basic story still works and it did enough to interest me and have a narrative that I cared about but saying 'this happens, that happens and this happens' is not the same as writing a story with detail and intelligence  Lucas can only do the former. It was too late to address the character failings of the previous two films and the script can't  the characters are flat and my lack of emotional buy-in with them was a problem; of course my nostalgia helped to some degree but you can't ride on that alone. The biggest difference between the original (which was hardly Shakespeare after all) and this is fun. Everyone loves Han because he is great fun. Here everyone talks like they're delivering the most worth lines ever and it is rarely 'fun'; it is dry where it needed to be lively and it is only one or two childish moments with R2D2 that drew small laughs from the audience.This leaves his cast with a difficult task  delivering lines and characters that don't even work that well on paper. We seem to either have lots of action or the characters stand around explaining the story to the audience in long, overly-worthy speeches. Christensen is not awful, but with so little to work with he just comes off as rather wooden and simplistic; considering the strength and impact of Vader, the poor writing of his fall was surprising. Once inside his suit, Vader moves funnily like whoever was inside was overdoing things to compensate for the mask. McGregor can't do that much and just settles for doing his best Alex Guinness impression. Portman is shunted to one side and does OK with her few scenes, but the film can't spend too long on her so anything she might have been able to do is wasted. Jackson is at least cool  and thus manages to rise above his basic character and provide weight to his words. Ian McDiarmid produces such a wonderfully hammy performance that I expected him to reveal fangs and say 'I vant to suck your blood'; he was great fun though. The rest of the cast are all in small roles without ever being important to the audience  it was nice to see Chewy, R2, C3P0 and others but this was not their film.Overall, I forgave Clones because it had enough in it to just about stop me disliking it, but here I was not so forgiving  perhaps because I had higher hopes and saw it as being the most important part of the new films; just like Empire was the best of the original, this should have been an intense experience that had effects as the second reason for seeing it  not the first. As it is, people will flock to it and be overwhelmed with noise, movement and colour, and perhaps that will be enough with the building block story to satisfy the summer blockbuster audience who only go to the cinema once or twice a year. However many viewers will find the development to be basic; the performances dry; the CGI overused; the action noisy but yet strangely uninteresting. I didn't hate it (it didn't draw any strong emotions from me) but, considering the key role this film plays within the series, it fell well short of the mark.",Null,35,68,22 May 2005
Shooter," Nothing particularly special but by doing the basics well and no aspiration above its station it manages to be enjoyable and slick
","Bob Swagger (no, really) is a top sniper for the US military. However when he is abandoned behind enemy lines during a black op, his spotter is killed and his faith in his commanders is gone. Three years later, Swagger is living in the hills with only his cynicism and a dog for company. Three men from the Government roll up one day, saying that they need Swagger's expertise to help work out where a long range threat to the president's life could possibly come from  something intel says is going to happen in the next few weeks. Swagger obliges, identifying the one likely spot and, before you can say 'oldest trick in the book', shots are fired, a visiting Ethiopian dignitary is dead and Swagger is shot by a cop who had been assigned to his unit. Swagger escapes with injuries but, with his face all over the television, can he clear his name and bring down the real perpetrators?This came and went in the cinema in the UK, doing the business that was expected of it but nothing more  drawing the audience one would expect for this sort of thing but nothing more. The reviews were middle of the road and there wasn't anything about it that inspired me to get out and see this. On a recent flight this was one of the choices and, looking for something that wouldn't require much thought, I plumped for it. What I found was pretty much what I expected in a that could be compared to an unsung hero on a championship team  it doesn't have anything unique about it, but it does the basics well and produces a roundly pleasing film that delivers just what you expect from it.It isn't perfect of course and nobody should expect it to be. The narrative arch is obvious before you even press play; too much time is spent with the additional character of the partner's girlfriend and it does tend to wear its cynicism obviously on its sleeve rather than weaving it into characters and plot. Plus, ignoring specific issues, it is a thriller that does not aspire to be more than a good thriller. As such it works, it moves forward well with an edge of 'military cool' that Hollywood generally gives the sniper character. It plays this very well, mostly making the plot move forward with a smooth flow to it. Wahlberg is a good choice for this type of thing as he is a good presence and makes for an accessible action hero. OK, maybe his character is sprayed onto his skin rather than something convincing and real, but who would have thanked him here for producing something deep? The support cast is heavy with familiar faces and names such as Glover, Koteas (or was it Meloni? I'll bet their mothers don't even know anymore), Mitra, Beatty and others. They all do OK without doing anything special as the material mostly requires 'sinister figures' from them. Peña is an OK sidekick for Swagger but I'm not sure I entirely bought his part in the film.Overall then, a perfectly fine action thriller that is all the more enjoyable for not really having many aspirations beyond that. Some bits could have been edited tighter to make it flow quicker at times and some of the superficial attempts at modern cynicism could have been lost but otherwise it makes for the type of movie that will be perfect as a DVD in with beer for the large target audience.",Null,9,20,15 June 2007
Bring It On," Unfunny, bland comedy, it S-U-C-K-SUCKS!
","The five times cheerleading champions find themselves in competition with another high school who have honed their routines to challenge for the title.  Torr adds to her team and competes with Isis's Clover Team for the state championship.This is a comedy.  I want to make that clear because I watched this and I didn't know it was a comedy until I read it on the side of the box.  The plot is almost unimportant it is so thin - basically it's a cheerleading competition.  There is some interest at the start with Dushku's sassy character trying out for the team, but she is quickly assimilated to be a characterless member of the gang and any interest is lost.  It's really difficult to get into the characters, mainly because the guts of the film is dance numbers but also because they are all preppy, unpleasant cheerleader types who look down their noses at others - why should I care what happens to them?  The whole thing culminates with the state championship but by then I'd pretty much given up.The comedy is very sparse, there are some funny moments, but nothing that stretches to a scene.  The main fault of the film for me was to turn the cheerleading contest into something that felt like a white v's black conflict - one team is predominately white while the other is predominately black.  I don't know if this was intentional but to make something as trivial as this and add race to it was a big mistake.Kristen Dunst proves that she can't lead a film and gives a terrible performance throughout.  Union and the other black characters give very clichéd performances and put the progress of black actors back ten years by being stereotypes of snapping fingers, neck movements and 'talk to the hand' style dialogue (The R n'B trio Blaque are the worst offenders).  It's almost embarrassing to watch them be the same black characters that are in every 'black' comedy.  As I said Missy (Dushku) is the only interesting character in the thing but even she is lost before the halfway mark.The conclusion is cheesy and the credits sequence (everyone singing 'Hey, Mickey' intercut with outtakes) is not half as charming as they think it is. Overall an unfunny, bland comedy that you will only enjoy if you like the sight of girls in cheerleader outfits.",Null,1,3,4 January 2002
Inception," Not all the hype suggests but still an enjoyable action thriller built on a good concept and encourages thought afterwards
","The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several 'levels' at once, I still found it easy to follow.The film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part – and not because I'm smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don't lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too 'ordinary' at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don't make any sense or have echoes of things, rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb's subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable 'baddie' turning up in various places throughout the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that 'was the real level actually a dream' is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going 'or was it?' without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to 'come in' with and she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of 'oh look its x' but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite didn't really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't – pay attention. Doesn't quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film.",Null,49,93,2 August 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," By-the-numbers affair, reaching for something it doesn't justify
","There probably aren't too many people who don't at least know of the conclusion to this story, and with that in mind you do have to wonder why they decided to remake it. I guess when it is well done, it is great stuff while also having a comfort of knowing where it is heading. This remake though is at best a Sunday afternoon film on a rainy day - certainly there is not enough to it for it to be able to justify its place in the cinema or as a big blockbuster film. Of course the cast and quality of the production would tell you otherwise, and it is impressive for what it puts on the screen, but it is what it does (or doesn't) do with it that is the problem.The film has a playfulness to it, but mostly it seeks to have weight to the performances and scenario. It lays it on a bit thick in this regard, resulting in the film feeling a bit dull because it carries itself heavy, but doesn't justify it or make it work. Individual parts are fine, and the film does have plenty to look at, but as a whole it is surprisingly leaden, lacking real suspense, zip, and vigor. A shame - probably it will play better when half-watched on a Sunday afternoon on BBC2 some years from now.",Null,2,4,11 February 2018
Defiance," Ed Zwick delivers a professional, worthy and slightly self-important film that is OK but doesn't have enough to be anything special
","As I believe I have mentioned before, my flat gives me a regular serving of bus-side posters in my face and it was here that I saw the poster for Defiance. I had also read some promo pieces and generally I was looking forward to it. Before I got to see it I had had my enthusiasm tempered a bit by looking at the poster closer and seeing 'from the maker of Last Samurai and Legends of the Fall' on there  not the best films to list if you trying to draw me in because, although he is generally a good Hollywood director, Ed Zwick's involvement countered some of what I had been told about this film  the memories of Last Samurai are still raw with me! Before I get into my opinion on this film, let me just say that it is unmistakably an Edward Zwick film. Perhaps I could not have picked it out as such blind but once you know it is impossible not to recognise it for what it is. I say this because Defiance is delivered with great sweep, battle sequences are 'important' rather than intense, sets and costumes are impeccable, the cinematography good but not that inventive and ultimately the whole project has an air of being worthy. It was the case with Last Samurai but the thing with that was, among other issues, it just didn't convince that it deserved that 'worthy' air, at least with Defiance there seemed to be more potential for it being deserving of this.Foruntately Defiance is a much better film than Last Samurai and it is a shame that it is just not as good as it should have been. I will leave the debate over the accuracy of the film to the message board users but shall merely say that if you rely on Hollywood films for your historical facts then you have problems that extent beyond this film. No, to me this is a story, not a matter of record and I did not watch the film concerned with where liberties were being taken (as they ALWAYS are taken). The rough thread of the film follows the three Bielski brothers as they lead a group of Jewish survivors into the dense forest to try and survive. The conflict comes where Zus and Tuvia clash on the amount of fighting they should do versus the amount of surviving. The film has elements of both. Almost without question Zwick is most comfortable with the fighting and the dying as both feed into his presentation of things as important, moving and worthy. This gives us plenty of battle sequences that do carry some emotion even if they feel air-brushed to a certain degree. This alone makes the film an engaging enough affair but for me it wasn't enough to make it something special.The main way it could have impacted me more was to have been less glossy and a lot rawer and gritty. This is a film about desperate survival and fighting against the odds but only once or twice did it get ugly. Tuvia's aim is to avoid becoming animals but of course conditions mean the group will be pushed right to that limit, but yet we only see that a couple of times and each of these are delivered simply and filmed with characters looking away. Again this comes back to the 'worthy' presentation because it feels like the film avoids this material for fear of painting the survivors in a bad light. I appreciated these moments for what they brought to the film but wanted them to be part of the story, no, part of the characters as this would have made the film realer, more urgent and more engaging. Instead we get battles of quite moving loss, heroic sacrifice and worthy looks, very worthy looks.Indeed it is a credit to the main actors that, even though a big slice of their time is spent looking 'worthy' and they don't have a lot in the way of character development outside of the broad sweep. Craig and Schreiber both deliver solid turns in the way the film needs. OK they do not have a lot of depth or complexity for the majority of the time but they find it when they can and do a good job otherwise. Bell has a bit more emotion and range to his character but again the script allows him to do what he does. These three carry the film and, although we have other characters, too many of them are simply drawn for the sake of filling the roles they fill.Defiance is not a bad film though, indeed it is quite engaging and quite good. The problem is that it is all too glossy and worthy, wearing the latter a bit too heavily and losing the human drama as a result. The cast don't have as much to work with as a result and rely on presence and doing the basics and turn in good performances as a result. It certainly doesn't deserve all the Oscar chat it is getting and, although it is not a bad film, it is only ever an OK one.",Null,8,16,11 January 2009
Lord of War," Despite the weaknesses inherent in the delivery and approach, this is an engaging and slick film on an important and depressing issue
","As a boy in Brighton Beach, Yuri Orlov realises that, while some people open restaurants because all men will need to eat, other men sell guys becomes man will always want to kill. Starting out in a grubby hotel room selling a single gun, Yuri uses his local connections to increase his trade. The end of the Cold War opened up huge stocks of weapons to be illegally skimmed off and sold abroad and soon all of Yuri's dreams are coming true  even his childhood infatuation with Ava Fontaine. However as his reputation and sales grow he comes under pressure form two forces closing in on him; one is a determined government agent Jack Valentine, the other is the morality of the business he has made his own.Whether or not it is based on a true story or not, the truth inherent in the material to make it an impacting and engaging story. The opening credits tell the whole story and it is shame that it never gets as good as the moments where we follow a bullet from the factory to the skull of a child somewhere in Africa. However the reason it doesn't is because the gun trade isn't as simple as evil men doing evil things  it is a business and it is a business that my own elected officials in the UK are a major part of. So although it makes for a weaker film in some ways, it deserves credit for not offering any easy answers (or indeed any answers) and offers up this world in a way that is sickeningly convincing and yet realistic. The plot relies heavily on the slick delivery that is told from Yuri's point of view and totally in flashback. It does fragment the film and prevent the development of characters and depth but it does keep things moving well and allows Niccol to make his points well. As a result some of the narrative threads are dull (Yuri's relationship with his wife is weak) but it does achieve what it sets out to achieve, which is a fast ride through the world illegal arms trading.Those who have caught Mark Thomas' shows will know that there are sharper vehicles that this subject has been handled in and indeed the film could have been more impact, funnier and darker but for a Hollywood film I can forgive it because it does tackle an unusual subject. This buys it some leeway but not all the weaknesses can be overlooked and some viewers may tire of the pace and delivery of the film before it is over. The cast are mostly caught up in the film rather than playing it because they are not allowed the time to develop or emote. As the story is his, Cage does dominate. It isn't a great performance but it works and he pitches his character well neither moral or immoral, just doing business and earning money just like everyone else. Moynahan does well with what little she is given but Leto is asked a lot of and cannot deliver it convincingly. Holm and Hawke deserve credit for adding their names to this 'issue' film but other than that they don't add a great deal. Walker is a solid presence as Baptiste even if he is a bit one dimensional a character.This is not a perfect film then, mainly because the flow and stylish delivery means that points are made in a sweeping rather than targeted fashion, while depth and character development are left to one side. However it is engaging because the subject is an emotive one and it is hard to be disinterested. Mark Thomas has done it better (and will do it better) but it is praiseworthy for a Hollywood film with such clout to raise awareness of the issue and it is a good film even if it does have these problems throughout.",Null,5,9,30 October 2006
Sherlock Holmes," A blockbuster (with the weaknesses that that brings) but entertaining and fun with good work by Downey and Law
","Having themselves witnessed the hanging and burial of murder and self-styled 'master of the occult' Lord Blackwood, Holmes and Watson can close another case – perhaps their last since Watson is planning to settle into marriage. However, a ruptured tomb and a missing corpse suggest that there may be something to Blackwood's threat to Holmes to return from beyond the grave and commit further crimes. With London in the grip of a panic over the supposed resurrection of Blackwood, Holmes and Watson attempt to solve the mystery even as the stakes are escalating.The news that Mockney king Guy Ritchie was working on a new film of Sherlock Holmes was greeted by many (including myself) with trepidation at best and outright horror at worst. The inability of Ritchie to break away from the clichés and rather tired genre that he himself helped create led me to assume that he would simply be doing another version of his one trick but with a character probably called Sherlock 'Sleuther' Holmes in it. Although there is an element of Ritchie doing his usual stuff, this didn't turn out to be the case because the film is all rather entertaining and makes for an enjoyable winter blockbuster – perhaps not impressive enough to slug it out in the summer season, but certainly good enough to be in cinemas now. It must be said that some will have an issue with Holmes as a bare-knuckle fighter and other such 'updates' but my attitude is that the Rathbone/Bruce films from the 1940's were not the most faithful either and put entertainment as their focus – to the point that Holmes was moved forward in time to join the war effort against the Nazis for several films.So the question is whether or not this new Holmes film is entertaining or not and whether or not the many liberties taken will annoy the casual viewer or not. The answer can be found by watching the film because mostly it is very easy to enjoy as a blockbuster film. The plot has weaker moments but is mostly good enough to keep things moving and, while it does rely on special effects and convenience at times, it does have sufficient meat (or at least appearance of meat) to make you feel like there is some logical substance to it. Of course the plot produces a lot of action, which is mostly reasonably good but is certainly not as exciting as it could have been. The editing is part of the problem as it employs a blurry style that seems to detract more than it adds. The use of CGI as well is best described as 'solid' because while not bad, it is not as seamless or as well-used as one would have hoped. While mentioning the visuals I will add that, while it may have just been a poor projection in my screening, the whole film seemed poorly lit – I'm fine with a Gothic dimness, but this was murky across the board and just made it harder to watch rather than adding atmosphere.Ritchie's direction is solid as well. He produces some of his usual tricks but I did like his use of slow-motion at key moments, not because it made those moments more exciting (it didn't – indeed it makes it a bit less so), but rather because it is different and does give the film a feel that makes it stand out a little from the other blockbusters that would do everything as fast and as noisy as possible. The main selling point of the film is not all this though, but rather the main thing that makes it fun – which is the good work of the cast. Downey is surprisingly good as Holmes – a fun character with a playful logic but also selfish and perhaps self-destructive streak. Likewise Law plays his Watson well, perhaps not bringing a lot to the character but allowing for the relationship between the two to be part of the film. Strong is a good villain of the piece, while Marsan does a typically 'two steps behind' Lestrade. McAdams is good but it must be said that I did get the feel that most of her performance was about how good-looking she is rather than her abilities as an actress – it works though.The decision to leave Moriarty as character in the background is a good one because it gives the sequel(s) a strong card to play – and one that I would return to watch. Ritchie's Holmes is not without weaknesses but it is solid enough to entertain, thanks mostly to the good turns from Downey and Law (individually and together) adding to the sense of fun that the film has.",Null,2,6,7 January 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Has some big weaknesses but is generally and engaging and convincingly brutal war movie in the mould of Private Ryan
","Jin-tae and his younger brother Jin-seok both look after their mother and Jin-tae's wife, with the former shining shoes to support them. However when North Korea attacks the South, the Government calls up all available men to join the war. In a sweep of the town square, Jin-seok is taken by the army. On his return to the square, Jin-tae boards the train to try and get his brother off but only succeeds in both of them being taken to the front. Jin-tae appeals to the commanding officer to send his younger brother home and, in doing so, learns that others have won the right for send another home by performing heroically and beyond the call of duty. Jin-tae decides to win his brother's freedom.Having seen Swiri a few years ago I was already aware that Je-gyu Kang was good at taking Hollywood influences and using them within his Korean films. In this case his influence is clear and, as many others have noted is Saving Private Ryan. In both the scale of the battle scenes and in the narrative revolving around a more personal, small-scale story of brothers the film does seem to have been inspired by this Hollywood film. Others have compared it ad nauseam, seemingly without the ability to view this film on its own terms, so I will try to avoid doing the same. As its own film it is both impressive and deeply flawed. The impressive elements come in the intense battle sequences which are convincingly chaotic and filled with death. Kang has done very well to pull them off .Ironically the weakest part of the narrative also manifests itself in the battle sequences  specifically where Jin-tae seems so invincible throughout. I know this is the point of the film but the regularity in which he survives the most intense battles and closest combat is a bit distracting. Despite this the narrative still deals with the two brothers well, seeing both of them change across the duration of the war, with the brutality and death taking its toll on them both. This is well brought out by Jang and Won, both of whom are engaging in their characters and deal with the changes well. The support cast round out the unit well and add to an ensemble feel as well as giving emotional attachments beyond the lead two.Overall then, a solid and engaging war drama. The plot asks us to accept Jin-tae's invincibility to the point that it is not always easy to swallow, but aside from this the story works pretty well. The battle scenes are difficult to follow and the violence comes so quickly that it is hard to follow but then that is the point  for the action to be overwhelming and confusing. Not as strong as it needed to be on the story level but still an engaging war movie that will be of interest to those who liked (if that's the word) Saving Private Ryan.",Null,4,8,11 December 2006
The Waterboy," Amiable comedy
","Longtime waterboy Booby Boucher is fired from his job with the Cougar's and finds himself 31 years old and separated from his passion for generating the perfect glass of water.  He joins the losing team, the Muddogs and his reaction to bullying impresses the coach so much he joins him up as a defender without Bobby's Mama knowing.  Can he go all the way  and more importantly can he make friends?While most of Sandler's stuff is crass, crude and unfunny his best two films have seen him play losers who are sympathetic because they are quite simple. Here is one of his best so far  a simple comedy that mixes physical comedy with some good jokes and asides.  The plot doesn't matter but the telling is refreshingly free of cruel jokes or really crude jokes and is actually quite amiable.Sandler manages to not be annoying (shock).  He almost manages to be understated and subtle!  Bobby is really good and you can't help but root for him.  Likewise Winkler is really good as the timid coach for similar reasons.  Bates is good value as Mama simply because she is over the top and very funny.  Balk is sexy and pretty funny, while cameos from Rob Schneider and Clint Howard are funny for the first few times but not for long. Various faces from American foosball make it interesting but didn't really do it for me.Overall it may not be great and may well be pretty basic but you really can't help but be charmed by it.  Remarkably amiable fare from someone not known for their gentle comedy.",Null,3,5,17 July 2002
WALL·E," Beautifully crafted and charming film that appeals to adults and children without having two films in one but by making it all work for both
","It took me a minute to get round to seeing this film, mainly due to letting the kids clear out of the cinema and the hype / pester power effect on the audience demographic settle down some. Finally getting to see it for myself I was pleased to find that it is the probably the most accomplished Pixar film since, well, since the last one. Of course the most obvious way that things has stepped up yet again is technically as the film is beautifully animated with even convincing dust hanging in the atmosphere and even the humans 'real' (well, real in the context of the Pixar universe anyway). The level of detail is not only technically impressive but also impressive in the imagination and creativity in making this world and characters. However its in the characters where the film is most impressive. Without a great deal of dialogue to speak of it is amazing that the film manages to create characters that are not only cute and funny but also that the audience care about and for, and this is what the film achieves, making Wall-E an ET for this generation. The plot operates on two levels and the characters are most important for the simple, very human, love story between Wall-E and Eve. This thread is charmingly delivered throughout and it is hard not to feel for Wall-E as he seeks out the simple feelings and gestures that he has watched nightly for hundreds of years.Operating above this is a plot that owes a debt to Silent Running in the same way as Wall-E himself owes something to Huey and Dewey. With a heavier hand at the wheel, this would have been a very preachy and obvious eco-message but with Stanton it is actually pretty smart and manages to reach children without being clumsy and obvious for adults. Actually this also applies to the humour as well because there is not so much of a duality where aspects of the film are divided  so the character falling over is for kids but the one-liner that follows is for adults; instead Wall-E pretty much pitches everything to the benefit of the film and story. OK so we still get the references but they are not put in so much as woven in  hard to explain perhaps but if you watch this versus, for example, Shrek, you'll see what I mean  Wall-E is not some pop-culture reference-driven film that will be old in a few years once people forget who the celebs were that year. This strengths the film further by just feeling like an all-round engaging and enjoyable film  OK the level or depth that you watch it to will vary between adults and children, but it is this that is different  not WHAT they are watching so much as how.The 'cast' of the film are really the animators because, aside from a nice touch of casting in Weaver, the majority of work is done by them. As such Wall-E and Eve are very expressive considering what they are. It is all in tiny movements on the 'faces' and in the body language  actors struggle to always do it without dialogue so how much harder is it to get it right when you are creating it on a computer? The answer I guess would be 'much harder' which is why it is so impressive that with barely a word spoken we manage to care so much for these robots.Wall-E will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but, for probably the first time, Pixar have a film that genuinely deserves consideration for Best Feature  it is that engaging, well crafted and charming and manages to do that for all sections of the audience without resorting to the oft-used (and mostly fun) 'one for me, one for you' style of some of these films.",Null,5,9,15 September 2008
The Good Shepherd," Solid narrative but mistakes intelligence and maturity for just having an overly slow pace
","Time will see Edward Wilson become involved in the disastrous Bay of Pigs with the CIA and trying to locate the leak that caused the operation to fail. Looking back we see Edward Wilson as a young man in his days at Yale, where approaches to work for the OSS sees him travelling abroad as Britain goes to war. Back at home his already weak family life is hurt by the distance as his wife gives birth to a son. At work his simple ideals are influenced by the sense of mistrust and paranoia that exist as part of his job and from those all around him.There is no denying that at times this film does move painfully slowly. Some people have claimed that this slow pace is all part of the film having a 'grownup' narrative but this a bit like assuming that a car must have a stereo  they are common together but they are not mutually exclusive. So it is here as a mostly engaging narrative is badly misjudged in regards pacing, stretching the material so thinly at times that it does suffer; I can understand why this is accepted as being part and parcel of the story but I personally think that it is a flaw in the delivery.It is a shame as well because the story does have the potential to produce a grown-up espionage story where the sense of mistrust is as important as the actual actions within the story and indeed it does deliver this well, if you manage to overlook the sluggish pace. Some have claimed the story to be wonderfully complex and to an extent they are correct but this is as much to do with the structuring of the story as it jumps around in time. That said I still found the narrative interesting, but not to the point that I found it as strong as others have claimed.The driving heart of the film is left to Damon, who gives a strong performance that is the opposite of the equally good turns he has been giving as Jason Bourne. He ages his character really well without any significant use of make-up; the make-up of his character being enough for him to mark out that transition. The rest of the cast is ramming with star names but few are given the time to be more than 'OK' and none match the consistent presence of Damon. Baldwin, De Niro, Gambon, Hutton, Sessions, Pesci, Blanchard, Hurt and others all provide solid support but I felt that, of all of them, Jolie stood out like one massive sore thumb. She is badly miscast and she pushes her character beyond what the material suggests she should be. She is a disappointment and distraction. As director, I did think that De Niro was lacking in some areas and that the ability to bring her in was one of them. Perhaps the pacing was another but blame for that also lies in the editing suite. Visually he has a good eye for the shot and makes some wide shots work just as well as close ones, both contextually working as well as visually.Overall then, an OK film that is some in the middle of the praise and criticism directed at it. It is a smart script but the pacing is not part of it  in fact it is an error in the delivery that damages the flow of the story and makes it harder work than it needed to be. The collection of stars (what is the collection noun for that anyway) are solid but slightly distracting  although none moreso than a badly miscast and misfiring Jolie. Thank goodness then that Damon provides a rock of a lead and makes the film better than it could have been albeit still less than the sum of its parts.",Null,3,6,26 July 2007
Finding Dory," Has the technology and comedy but, most importantly, the heart is front and center
","I confess I approached Dory with a certain wariness, since it seemed odd to have a sequel so many years after the original, plus the concept sounded like it would simply be a rehash of the original film but with a different lead character. In a way the latter thought is valid, since there are similarities between the films in terms of characters, jokes, and narrative. However Dory manages to be more than a late cash-in, and stands up as another very fine Pixar film.The impressive animation goes without saying, although it is really amazing what can be done with computer animation now. The plot itself is not brilliant; it does feel overly familiar in essence, and it of course relies a huge amount on coincidence and convenience – in a lesser film such things would be a major distraction, but here they are not so much. The reason for this is how well the majority of it works. The pacing of the delivery is spot-on throughout, and the writing of the characters and their dialogue is much better than the base narrative. It is consistently funny, with plenty of snap to the delivery, but really what makes it work is the same with the majority of Pixar films – which is that it has heart.Dory is more than a comedy blue fish; she has inadequacies, pain, and insecurities while also at the same time being warm, likable, and engaging. A lot of this rests with the delivery by DeGeneres; certainly this is not a dialed-in piece of voice-work that can often be the case with animated films, this is a real performance. She brings a lot to the character and it comes across in the film, making us care and go with her. The other voice work is not at that level, mainly because they do not have to be, but there is plenty of good work here, even if some of it is a bit more of a piece (eg O'Neill and Burrell very much play how you are used to them playing). Too many to point out, in small and larger roles, but my favorite of course was a Wire reunion for McNulty and Bell.A very enjoyable family film; all of Pixar's usual strengths, but the most important one is that the character of Dory is tangible, emotive, and engaging.",Null,1,6,26 December 2016
Stalag 17," Enjoyable but uneven mix of comedy and drama
","When two POW's are killed during a breakout attempt from POW camp Stalag 17, the POW's suspect that an insider is passing information out to the guards. As the guards seem to be more and more aware of the prisoner's activities the POW's turn on Septon, who deals regular trades with the guards.  However Septon knows he's innocent and sets about to find who the real informer is.Adapted from a Broadway play this film is an uneasy but enjoyable mix of comedy and Steve McQueen's sections from The Great Escape.  The comedy is pretty funny  ranging from the broad comedy of Animal, Schlitz et al to the more subtle things such as the German officer putting on his boots to speak to Berlin HQ.  However the wartime drama section doesn't work as well and is a bit of a letdown after a comedy first half.  However it's still quite entertaining  even if it is a little uneven.The cast are good overall  although the comedy figures have the best characters.  Preminger, Taylor, Strauss etc are all good but I imagine it must have been quite a thin year when Holden won his Best Actor Oscar for this rather dour performance  maybe they were rewarding an earlier performance that he should have won for (that seems to be the way it's done now  Dame Judi Dench anyone?!).Overall it's an enjoyable wartime comedy, but the uneven mix of drama and comedy doesn't sit well together and this is far from being Wilder at his best.  To prove the point  the spin off Hogan's Hero dropped the drama (and all but one character) in favour of straight laughs.",Null,5,10,16 March 2002
Arrival," Engaging in the way it reaches for more, albeit without shaking off the superficial, and the standard 'first contact' stuff (SPOILERS)
","Arrival sees first contact between aliens and humanity, as 12 large craft arrive at different points around the earth. In the US a translator is employed to try to help communicate with the aliens, but at the same time the military prepare for a worst case scenario.Outside of the fuss over the poster error, and the hype about how great the film is, I finally got to watch it on its own merits. On the face of it, it is a solid piece of sci-fi delivered on a big scale. With this territory comes a lot that is very familiar, and a lot that doesn't totally make sense of fit with even the internal logic, however the film mostly manages to overcome these traps by having them while also making the film much smaller. It does this by latching onto the character of Banks and making it about her. The message that it delivers through this device is not as profound as it thinks it is; it still works and had an impact, but it does throw away a lot of ideas to get to the slightly sentimental heart of the matter.It is Adams' performance that carries this. She sells her character at almost every stage, and as the film focuses on her it means that we go with the film. The supporting players provide plenty of familiar faces and a feeling of quality, but do not add as much as her. The high production values and effects mean nothing breaks the world- creation, and it makes it easy to go with.In the end it is not this amazingly profound film that some will tell you it is, but it is still a solidly enjoyable sci-fi that has a lot within it, and even when it all comes down to a quite simple conclusion, it still works on those terms.",Null,8,13,29 March 2017
The Terminal," A really charming film with a slight dig at the US's protectionist policy and our assumptions. It survives Spielberg's sentimentality overdose but watching the failed scenes with Jones is almost painful (spo
","I decided to give this film a go even though I knew it had under performed at the box office in America and had been labeled a 'flop' by some critics.I sat to watch it not sure what to expect but I was pretty much totally won over by it which, considering how very anti-mush I am, is actually quite an achievement. The plot is very simple and it relies totally on us feeling a little bit warm and forgiving  a feeling that the film does well to give to us in an opening hour that is relentlessly charming and amusing. Some viewers will be annoyed by a fragmented feel to the story that, at points, seems to lack a drive but it is the sort of thing that just glides forward slickly and, for that reason, Spielberg was probably the best man for the job. His excessive mush comes through in the love at first sight between Torres and Enrique  for most of their thread it is charming and sweet and hopeful. However Spielberg cannot cope with just ending their story with a meeting and hope, no, he has to go from nothing to marriage in the space of a few seconds in an embarrassing 'Star Trek' moment (and guys; women this hot do not spend all their time at Star Trek conventions  sorry).I found it annoying but luckily this was only one scene but Spielberg also misjudges an entire thread that just doesn't work at all  the romance between Amelia and Viktor. I feared that it would be used as a big happy ending and, I suppose, am glad it wasn't  but then why bother with it in the first place? If it worked well then it would be a good thread around the others but for the most part it doesn't. Sadly, the main reason is fails is Jones herself. She is pretty, but she is also awful here. She has almost no chemistry with Hanks and she cannot do anything with her character  the moment where her boyfriend goes to a barbecue instead of seeing her didn't convince me at all and just looked like someone unconvincingly pretending to be upset. Later, a moment of honesty with Viktor on the balcony is delivered with no heart but a lot of blinking and eyelid fluttering. It is a shame because I liked the way the film didn't cash in for the big happy ending, but it just didn't work and since it was only a small part of the film, it should have been cut out completely.Despite this, the rest of the cast are really good. Hanks could have just been absurd with his accent but he pulled it off and convinced me enough to do the job in this type of film. He works well in every scene and it is only the scenes with Jones where I got the impression that he was banging his head against a brick wall. He overdoes the 'big huggable bear' routine a bit too much but it fits with the mood of the film, which itself is a big lovable, huggable thing. Tucci is a nice foil for Hanks and their battle of wills is the thread that holds the whole premise together; he is mean without being beyond redemption or overly cruel, pulling it off that we don't hate him, we understand he is holding to the importance of the rules. Support is generally very good even if their characters are really too 'nice' to convince me that they could exist in real life! Luna overdoes the sweet Hispanic role but is still fitting; Saldana is gorgeous as ever and is really nice in a role that only asks her to slowly melt to be sweetly vulnerability! Pallana is really funny and gets the mindset of labourers pretty well; his reward is a key role in an overblown (but moving) moment that was such a good image I'm sure it will stick in my mind for ages.The film also makes a point in response to security tightening around immigration and airports  it is a gentle point and I would hesitate to even suggest it were strong enough to be called 'criticism'. The message is to try and look at the people coming to America  they are not all terrorists, benefit spongers, criminals and so on; they are people and deserve a compassion that recent events have shown perhaps doesn't exist to the degree that it could. The film doesn't labour this point and I think many people may not even have noticed it. The point is that we can show compassion to people without the world ending, but that we still need controls (note that Viktor does not stay  even if that would have made a 'happier' ending). The character of Viktor also works as a challenge. We start with him as just a foreigner who speaks little English and is a bit clueless but is developed to the point that we accept him as a person and not on our first impressions: a challenge to the unofficial 'profiling' view of current immigration policies, but not so strong as to suggest scrapping what is in place  just humanising it. Finally, the film reminds us that not everybody in the world actually wants to come and live in the US and chase the American Dream; Viktor's final action in the film? To head home.Overall I really enjoyed this film. It is overly sentimental, flawed and relies on you being totally in the mood for it but it easily won me over. Not a film to watch if you are in a very cynical mood about anything but one that is fun, warming and sweet but also has interesting things to say. The US box office may not say it, but this is a great film.",Null,4,9,26 September 2004
The Blind Side," A TVM with a Hollywood cast – solid but nothing more than that
","Sandra Bullock's Oscar was perhaps a given but the award gave this film a bump for those who have not already seen it – which is all of us in the UK as the film only came out recently. Watching it though it is hard to shake the feeling that in about 10 years (once the terrestrial premier etc has died down) this will find its rightful home on daytime television surrounded by other overly sentimental 'true-story' movies. If you take the couple of Hollywood faces out of this film then there is very little else to it that you wouldn't get there.This is not to take away from the basic story which is engaging and quite touching when you go through it, but rather the way it is done. The material is delivered without any insight or depth and what this results in is a rather schmaltzy film that has regular musical cues to let you know how to feel and never really gets to the heart of any of the characters. In doing this it is still an OK film and the actual story is warming and solid enough to do the job – albeit even those who don't know the outcome will have that spoilt for them by the film opening with the assumption that everyone already knows who Michael Oher is. It wonders along with lots of touching moments, sad looks, cute kids and lots of 'overcoming' but it doesn't manage to lift itself above the clichés in any way other than how professionally made it all is.Bullock doesn't deserve her Oscar for this but who could begrudge her since she is as charming as she is profitable. She does have good moments and she does get the mix of tough exterior and inner emotions but she doesn't do more than that and it is hardly a brilliant performance. Aaron is suitably large and quiet and, from the archive footage at the end, certainly seems to capture the manner of the real person, even if there is always a sense of 'air brushing' about his performance. Head is irritating as one would expect while McGraw and Collins are so-so. Bates adds another famous face to the mix but nobody really does more than the basics.It is not that The Blind Side is a bad film because I did actually quite like it in an obvious sort of way; it is more that the film itself is sentimental and clichéd without anything in the way of genuine grit or character to get into. The performances are solid and Bullock does her stock no end of good with an engaging 'professional conservative Mom' turn that has sold well in the areas you would expect, but nobody can do a great deal with this material.",Null,1,4,25 March 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Simply a great story that is moving and uplifting
","Andy Defresne is a young banker who goes to pieces when he learns his wife is being unfaithful.  He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is picked up for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of innocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately introduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's story of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve the conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is surprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15 or 20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However time has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is mainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that engages and eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film and others appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well with all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the key difference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy and Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very easily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at the same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this simple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by so many viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a little too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any Hollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so far to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship that aren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no tension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the ending was too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been more in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to this.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins is great as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable in his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I was caught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the Irish guy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father figure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The chemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine support actors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others may not always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to be very clichéd (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with the genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main relationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not the most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is very good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As director Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane shot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has become almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping sense of hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high appearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great little story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clichés of the genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope that it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a popular and moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that see it.",Null,16,31,13 April 2004
The Cannonball Run," Quite fun but very, very basic stuff
","A rich Sheik organises an illegal cross country race in order to bring together the best drivers from all over the world.  The drivers all race over several days to be the first to collect the finish line by fair means or foul.This was set at the high of the days when car chase/car crash movies were all the rage with Smokey and the Bandit et al.  So to complain that this movie doesn't make sense or is only really brainless eye candy is to miss the point.  Yes  the plot makes no sense  why didn't those cars with two drivers just work shifts while the other's slept etc, also some of the vehicles are clearly not in the same league as the others (but still keep up!).  However it's still funny and amusing in a really brain dead way and it's quite fun to watch while sitting in neutral!The cast are great (on paper) with a list of stars.  However any comedy relying on Dom DeLuise and Reynolds is never going to be great!  Fawcett and Barbeau are hotter than I've ever seen them anywhere else, and the film uses the whole `girls in catsuits' thing shamelessly well!  The majority of the cast are really window dressing  Martin, Davis Jnr, Chan, Moore etc but all are OK  if you're happy with the film as a whole then performances are not really what you'll be looking for I guess.The comedy is pretty lame  the outtakes are hilarious but really only show up how basic and lacking in spark the rest of the film is.  The dumb action is good if you're in a veggie mood but really this is very basic.  The star cast make up for some of the weakness and keep the interest but really the outtakes are the best bits.",Null,3,6,10 August 2002
Rango," Overlong but mostly works despite awkwardly jumping between audiences all the time
","This is such a strange film to watch because you never really get a feel for who it is actually made for. The easiest answer is that it is for all ages and this would perhaps explain why it took up so much time to deliver a rather straightforward plot – because of it trying to do things for so many sections of one audience. The plot sees an aspiring actor lose his way and end up in a smaller western town. Keen not to get killed, he adopts a tough character and plays the role to the hilt. The town embraces him due to his (accidental) disposing of a villain and soon he is charged with returning water to the dying town – a task that sees him come up against much bigger villains and also forced to confront the truth that his whole personae is just an act. Oh, forgot to say – he's a chameleon.On the face of it, this is a cartoon so therefore it is for children. On the other side it starts very early with references that children wouldn't get and never stops them. But then again it is full of very noisy sequences and sight gags, but then on the other side again we have characters from 1970's westerns, from Chinatown and have lots of slightly crude (but funny) humor. This would not be the first film to have material for children and adults but in Rango they never really seemed to gel – so here it wasn't a throwaway line for adults, but whole chunks of the films plot and themes seemed more suited to an older audience, whereas it would snap back into kiddie mode at times. The mix never comes together to produce one film for everyone but this isn't to say it doesn't work.Personally I think the children get the rough end of the deal because I found Rango really funny at times and also really enjoyed the cinematic references and the endless knowing gaps which would go over younger heads. For them they are left with the lesser part of the film – the empty noise, the fast moving sequences which seem to only exist for the sake of having them – maybe they work, but they are thinly spread over 2 hours, most of which children I guess will be more bored and perhaps annoyed at their parents enjoying it more than they. The voice work is part of this. I really enjoyed Depp here; his character is funny and his delivery is just right for the material. He is supported by probably more famous faces than the film needs (Fisher, Beatty, Molina, Nighy, Stanton, Olyphant, Winstone etc) but they all add a sense of class. The animation is top-notch and I liked that it was inventive within the visual themes of the western – it never felt like a copy or ripoff so much as a starting point to then do more.Rango doesn't totally work as a whole film. It has much to recommend about it but it is overlong and it does seem fragmented between audiences. The older viewer gets the better part of the film and if you go with it there is a solid plot supported at every turn by references, jokes and solid playing from all involved. Not perfect but I enjoyed it.",Null,1,1,15 December 2013
The Big Short," Interesting approach which is not wholly successful but is still an engaging and enjoyable film
","Putting the story to one side for a minute, this is an interesting film in terms of what it does and how it does it. On the face of it, the film could (and maybe should) be a drama that unfolds the astonishing mayhem, corruption, and negligence of an economic collapse that saw millions lose their jobs and homes. Instead it is mostly a comedic affair that cuts in a Ludicrous music video, and has economic principles explained by a cutaway to an actress in a bubble bath. Along the way it also has room for drama and a mostly factual delivery of the scale of the horror of the events that unfolded and landed us where we remain today.It really shouldn't work, but it does – and really well. The cutaways, the music, and the editing all add a sense of excess and the erratic, which does suit the subject matter very well. Meanwhile the core character (Carell's) provides the reaction of the viewer – amazed but yet sickened by what he finds when he looks closer at the growth on which we all relied. The other characters are not quite as strong as his, but the film mostly spreads the material well enough so that the starry cast don't seem wasted. Having said that, Gosling is hardly doing his best work, while Bale feels like he is hanging around while his character transitions from being the predictor to being right. McKay directs with energy which does mostly work, but it is really the writers that deserve the credit for balancing the material – and editor Corwin who finds the film in all of the chaos (interestingly, he edited Natural Born Killers, which seems a good fit).Interesting for the narrative, as well as how it delivers the narrative.",Null,0,0,2 July 2016
Platoon," Uncomfortable but very worthy view of war's impact on the young
","At the height of the Vietnam War, America's teens are drafted into the war effort to find themselves in the middle of hell.  One such young man is Chris Taylor.  He is placed in a squadron where two sergeants have different approaches to the war  Elias is more about surviving without being brutal or cruel, whereas Barnes is crueller, more ruthless and more violent. During the course of his term, Taylor's very soul is torn between the two men as he deals with what he must do.The first film in Oliver Stone's unofficial trilogy is arguably the best of the three.  The basic story not only shows us what the war was like for those serving but also how the different personalities come out of those involved in it.  As we follow Taylor we see him change as he is influenced by those around him and by his situation.  It makes for an uncomfortable film but one that's worth watching.  It's certainly a better war movie than things like Wild Geese or The Dirty Dozen, simply because it's a little more real to what happens than those ones.Charlie Sheen has never been better than when he's acting for Stone.  Here he gives one of his best ever performances as the innocent who is changed. Willem Dafoe is a great actor and here is no different  he also gives us one of the film's most enduring images so I'm a little biased.  Berenger is another one for whom it's hard to think of a higher point reached than when he did this film.  He is brutal and ruthless but he makes us support him in a strange way.  The support cast are all good and contains a few famous faces (John C McGinley, Whitaker, Depp) however this is really a three man show.Overall this is brutal and violent with no happy ending.  At the end of the day isn't that what a war film should be?",Null,119,156,3 July 2002
Scream," Scary, funny and clever  the best Scream movie by miles
","Almost a year after someone raped and killed Sidney Prescott's mother in the small town of Woodsboro, someone is killing teenagers.  When Sidney herself becomes a target, the link is apparent and her missing father is a suspect. However, as with all good scary movies, everyone is a suspect.The film that sparked the revival of horror movies (Halloween H2O, I know what you did last summer, Urban Legend etc all followed..thanks a lot!). This stands out from all those (and it's lackluster sequels) by being really good and clever.  The story is nothing more than the standard slasher plot  but it avoids the cliches quite well.  In fact it uses the cliches as references and makes plenty of jokey references to other movies and the supposed rules of horror movies  we even have a quick flash of a caretaker dressed in Freddy's jumper and hat!That doesn't mean it's not scary  it is!  From the tragically horrible opening 10 minutes through each gory killing the tension is high and the shocks are real.  The plot twists nicely and the ending is much better than most slasher movies (including the absurd endings of 2 and 3).  This manages to be fresh, clever and scary  getting by any sticking moments with it's tongue in it's cheek.The cats are good  Campbell is a believable virgin, scarred by what happened to her mother  before she starts turning into Buffy the vampire slayer in parts 2 and 3.  Cox is excellent playing against type and David Arquette is funny as the Deputy Sheriff.  Kennedy as Randy is also funny as the movie geek  in fact he remains the highlight of the next 2 films.  The cast being filled of up and coming faces (including Ulrich) makes it even more thrilling when the `wrong' people get killed, technically all the cast are `unknowns' who usually make up the body count, so really anyone can potentially get offed.Overall funny black comedy, scary thrills and gory excitement.

Determined not to back down, Jake is taken to the school of fighter Jean Roqua.For some reason I had it in my head that Never Back Down was a tough, adult action movie of sorts  probably due to the hyper-content of the trailer. The rather bland reality is that the film is a generic twist on Karate Kid, with a form of cage fighting (I don't care enough to phrase it correctly) taking the place of karate. We all know where it is going and the film offers nothing in the way of surprises or real interest along the way. The characters are paper-thin and their various stories are nothing more than lip-service to the idea of plotting rather than a genuine attempt to layer the film. The fights are so-so but not that exciting, although I did like the convincing and relevant use of phone cameras, you-tube etc. The delivery is endlessly frantic and full of music in an attempt to create life where none exists. Amazingly enough it works and the visual style, editing and wall-to-wall soundtrack does give it an energy and presence that nothing else about it warrants.The cast match this approach by being incredibly good-looking; we have the 'geeks' of course but otherwise everyone has bodies that I would kill for but will not get off the sofa for! Otherwise though they are pretty bland  Faris in particular having little beyond his abs. Cigandet enjoys himself as a cocky w*nker and plays it convincingly even if he has nothing else. Heard is another in the endless parade of cookie-cutter starlet-wannabes in the cult of youth that is Hollywood. Hounsou is better than the film deserves and is he only person who really does a decent performance  but his is still an easy character and an obvious one.Never Back Down is nothing special whatsoever, although the effectively slick visuals and packaging will be enough to disguise this for many viewers. Think Karate Kid for the MTV generation and then take it down a few notches and that is what this film is. Will maybe suffice for fight fans and teenagers looking for something like the music videos but for the casual viewer it is just basic across the board.",Null,0,3,11 September 2008
Prometheus," Engaging sci-fi that was over-hyped but still satisfying
","Advertising for me is something that I regularly still fall into the trap of; products that look amazing and promise the world but yet cannot ever really deliver the way they suggest. With summer blockbusters this has worn off a little bit for me and generally I do not get excited by the big trailers or the hope of fans that the new blockbuster will be the 'best film eva'; such things are generally followed by equally silly claims at the other extreme when of course the film cannot live up to the marketing hype. So it was with Prometheus, a film I was happy to catch one the crowds had been and gone. It was also a film that I didn't pay attention to the trailers, hype or reviews – nor was I in a frenzy simply because it was a part of the Alien franchise, a franchise that now has more misses in it than hits.The ideas with Prometheus did interest me though and of course it helped that they were presented within a multimillion pound film. The film explores a planet used by the original creature from the first Alien film which was overcome by some infection; a team of scientists discover more than they bargained for and it all goes to pot. As such it is familiar territory even if it must be said that the film doesn't ever really directly touch the Alien creature as we know it (or at least not till the final scene – a scene that feels inserted because the fans need to see the Alien and also come back with their money for the next film). The tone of the film does though and in essence it is a horror movie with good ideas as creatures of one sort or another pose a threat to the humans. I found it quite tense at times even if it is never a frightening or as consistently tense as I would have liked it to be. It does still deliver plenty of horror of a sort though and I enjoyed the bigger picture which it fits into – I can understand why some were not satisfied with this aspect of it, but for me it was fine.The special effects are impressive but it is a credit to the overall film that they are never the reason I was engaged; the effects mostly were just part of the story. The cast feature plenty to look at as well, with lots of names and heavyweight talent. Rapace isn't quite Ripley but she is a good lead. Fassbender is solid and manages to make good with the role despite walking a very familiar path. Theron is a good addition while Guy Pearce is a surprise and almost unrecognizable behind his makeup. Elba has a weak American accent (not sure why – he was brilliant with it in The Wire). Wong continues to make himself something of a cult when it comes to being involved in British sci-fi.Prometheus may not be the brilliant Alien prequel that it was marketed on, but it is still an interesting sci-fi horror that fits into the bigger picture and delivers a satisfying yarn with strong special effects.",Null,2,10,29 September 2012
Wonder Woman," Solid genre movie - but still a genre movie
","I watched this before watching Spiderman: Homecoming, but wrote this after doing so. Without the comparison I was already disappointed in Wonder Woman; but after watching a Marvel film, the difference was all the more evident.Wonder Woman starts with a link to the modern attempt at a franchise before jumping back to an origin story. It is a simple affair in terms of setting up one main villain, and letting it play out. It does have some interesting and brave aspects to it, and I appreciated what it did in terms of the male lead and the ultimate villain, but there was a lot of baggy material around it. The supporting characters offer color but the film itself doesn't seem to spark. It is too earnest for the most part, and never gives the audience permission to enjoy it as a piece of entertainment (something that Marvel does well). The action sequences suffer from being too obviously CGI in nature, and some of the effects are surprisingly weak - in some moments it already looks dated and it has not been out that long.The cast are good though, and deserve more. Gadot is much more effective on the promotional appearances than she is here. At times she is limited by her range, at others she is limited by the material. Pine is good throughout but not much more than a twinkle and good humor in terms of character. Thewlis, Huston, Bremner, and others all add quality to the cast but there is not always the material there for them. Like all the superhero films, it ends up with two special effects hitting each other surrounded by lots of CGI destruction; but what matters is what it does outside of that and leading up to it. In the case of Wonder Woman, it doesn't do enough, and takes too long to do it.",Null,3,8,24 March 2018
Despicable Me," Funny and cute but needless to say it's no Pixar
","In an attempt to pull off a job that gets him noticed in the world of criminal villains, Gru comes up against plucky young rival 'Vector', who is very well equipped to say the least. In trying to steal a device from Vector, Gru adopts three young girls so that he can get robot cookies into Vector's lair. However, as successful as this is, he is still now legally parent to three girls – made all the more challenging by the fact that they are starting to grow on him, even if it is just a little bit.Years ago, I started writing down my thoughts on films in an attempt to try and put more thought into what I liked or didn't like about them; too often I would come out of the cinema and be asked what I thought only for me to say 'yeah, it was OK I guess' and nothing more. So mostly now I try to have more to say than just that. Of course sometimes it is hard because the truth is that some films are just 'OK I guess'. Despicable Me is another of the animated films that Pixar have helped to create by virtue of their success and it is one such film because it will not stand for the ages and it isn't as strong as Pixar can do (the most obvious comparison is the much better The Incredibles) but it is still a perfectly fine little film that amused and pleased me while I watched it despite me being unlikely to ever have to watch it again.The story is a simple enough one in which a villain finds a heart through three small children, it was always going to happen but I guess this is part of watching the film. Fortunately within this plot there is plenty that is funny, cute or cute and funny. Although it feels a little like ideas from other places, the project is still quite clever with good comic timing and imaginative touches that generally made me laugh. Plus I am a sucker for the cute – the little yellow creatures were a hoot and the three children were a constant delight to me with 'It's so fluffy' being my favourite line of the film by about a million miles. This charm carried it for me because otherwise it isn't quite as smart or as cleverly funny as I would have liked – the adult jokes in particular tended to feel more 'inserted' than being part of the film in the way Pixar (sorry for mentioning them again) do so effortlessly.Carell's voice work is pretty good. At first I thought it was a shame he is sort of hidden behind that accent but actually he makes it work well. Those doing the kids voices also work very well – getting the levels right to be cute and funny – even those that dislike children will be won over by these three (which I guess is key to the story and the film when you think about it!). I didn't think Brand was well cast – his accent stands out too much and his character and his voice didn't match up for me in the way it did for others. The supporting voices have some good names but none of them really stood out or ever threatened to distract from Carell in the lead.As an adult, Despicable Me is 'pretty good'. It isn't brilliant and it tended to remind me of other films and other ideas but it has enough laughs, enough cute and enough charm to easily entertain. Children will love it and, while not Pixar (sorry!) adults will find themselves quite charmed by it as well.",Null,1,1,13 March 2011
Back to the Future Part II," A fun film in a fun trilogy that the majority of viewers will easily enjoy
","Seconds after being left back in 1985, Doc Brown returns in his Deorean and whisks Marty and Jennifer off to the future (2015). Drugging Jennifer for her own protection, Doc tells Marty that he must stand in for his own kid, stand up to Biff's son and thus avert a change of events that would eventually destroy his family. The mission is accomplished fairly easily but both Marty and Jennifer discover their future, and neither likes what they see. Marty tries to smuggle a sports almanac back in time to make money betting. Doc stops him of course but Biff senior overhears and pieces it all together. Returning to 1985, Marty discovers that the present is totally changed, meanwhile Doc works out how it all occurred and sets out to put it right.For all the criticisms of summer 'event' pictures, it is hard to complain too much about the sheer pleasure that the Back to the Future trilogy gives. Starting where the last film ended, this picks up really well in regards mood and humour. The plot is pretty clever and superficially the complex time-travelling stuff holds up really well and is effortlessly accessible. Of course if you want to tear cosmic holes in it then it can be done but to do so would be like kicking a kitten. Using the plot from the first film to good effect the best thing the sequel retains is the original's sense of fun because it is entertaining and has good pace. One criticism of it would be that, instead of the actual plots used in parts 1 and 3, this has a lot of time jumping instead. That this works means that it isn't too bad that it is a bit overused but it is still a niggle nonetheless.The cast are as good as before and the main ones all buy into the sense of fun required to make it work. Fox shows why he was a big draw when he was younger and is the real heart of the film. He just about holds his own alongside scene-stealing Lloyd. Thompson is pretty good and Shue has more to do but from the support cast the dominant performance comes from Wilson, who is basic but does it very well. The effects are impressive for the time although watching it now you will have to forgive the very obvious split-screen technique when actors are playing different versions of the same character at the same time.It is the weakest of the three films but that is not really a major criticism in this film series because they are all consistently enjoyable. The narrative rides the time-travelling gimmick for all its worth but it just about makes it all work. A fun film in a fun trilogy that the majority of viewers will easily enjoy.",Null,2,5,1 September 2006
The Queen," Feels like a television drama perhaps, but if it is, then it is a superior one
","1997. Princess Diana is in a car crash in a tunnel in Paris. Hours later she is dead. Back in England, the new Labour Prime Minster Tony Blair senses how the country will react to the news and addresses the nation with a poignant and perfectly-scripted statement outside of a church. Meanwhile, the Royal family stay remote, trying to handle the grief, with the Queen refusing to lose her dignity by engaging in this very public mourning. However with the tabloids (who else) leading the charge, soon her restraint is being seen as callousness.I had fallen asleep watching a movie after a Saturday night at work and was woken by television in the middle of the morning to hear of the car crash. I went back to sleep and woke in the morning to find that Diana had died as a result of her injuries. I think many people were surprised by the public outpouring of emotion that followed  not just because it was Diana but more because we hadn't really seen this type of thing before. I'm still quite young but I still think of the British stiff upper-lip and dignity and this very public mourning just seems to contrast with that idea. Many people think this way looking back so imagine then the conflict in the minds of the Royal family  mostly an older generation raised to be dignified, restrained and respectful, with public emotion perhaps seen as distasteful.At the time this contrast was even more obvious as the UK had just had the young, modernising Blair sweeping into the office of the Prime Minister. It is simple to view (as some tabloids did) the Royal response as being heartless and cold but this is more the failure to understand what the differences are between the previous generation (who were told restraint) and the generations of the late 1990's (where television talk shows had encouraged outward emotion while tabloids erode the idea of privacy and restraint). I'm not sure when it actually happened but Diana's death was the biggest, sudden demonstration of it and I agreed with the line 'something's happened  some shift in values' because even to me as a 'normal' person it was somewhat of a surprise, like it had come from nowhere.The title of the film suggests it will be about the Queen herself and, while it is true that her character is the main one, the film itself is more about this cultural divide between what England used to be and what it is now and how that is manifested in the attitude of the Royals versus that of the 'public' (or at least a million or so of them and countless newspaper editors). As a total production it feels a little bit like it has been made as a high-budget television drama but this doesn't really matter because the film is very strong in how it depicts this generational clash. The narrative stays closely to what we know as facts and, around that, builds private conversations and interactions in a way that is convincing within the context of both the people but also the theme.In doing this well the film surprised me by being stronger than I had expected. I had feared that it would be a soapy replay of the period of time, with fictional conversations filling it out but by being close to reality and understanding what was actually happening that week (which the media mostly failed to appreciate or chose to ignore or simplify). A great deal of credit for this belongs to Peter Morgan as writer as his script allows for the dual approach to be equally strong. Frears' direction is perhaps a bit 'television' but mostly he is good  I liked the way that peace and remoteness of Balmoral was contrasted with the busyness of New Labour's government in London.In regards the cast of course it is Mirren that takes the headlines as she presents her character in a way that shows she does understand the cultural conflict within the narrative really well. Sheen's Blair is good as it has been a few other places. He looks and acts like the man but never to the point where it becomes an impersonation. Cromwell does well to avoid the 'clown' caricature that we all think of when thinking of Prince Phillip, while Jennings, Syms and others make up the family well. Bazeley's Campbell is an enjoyably harsh and cynical creation and he does it pretty well.Overall then, it may have a feel of a television drama at times but the strong performances and script mean it runs stronger than I expected. Kudos to Morgan in particular for writing a script that balances the 'drama' side of the story with the wider context of generational and cultural misunderstandings.",Null,3,5,12 July 2007
Blow," OK but nothing more than that
","Having seen his father struggle to pay the bills despite working like a dog, George Jung decides never to be poor. As a young man he moves out to the West Coast and discovers sun, sex and drugs in a big way. Without a job to bring in money, George and his friends start selling weed locally before realising the market back east in the university areas. From here he grows within his market and is soon flying in larger amounts, before eventually getting captured. However jail brings more opportunities as his cellmate provides a connection to a supply of cocaine and a whole different world.As far back as it could remember, this film wanted to be Goodfellas. From the very start and regularly all the way through this film has the feel of that film although it is never as good as the film that it seems to emulate. The approach is the same and it more or less works but only enough to keep things moving and never to the point where it is a great film. I'm not sure why but it doesn't flow naturally enough and feels longer than it really is, while at the same time never being weighty enough to be the crime semi-epic that it aspires to be at times. It isn't dull by any means but it just didn't do it for me and I didn't get engaged by it to the degree that I had hoped I would. The direction is OK but the feeling that Demme watched Goodfellas about 20 times before making this just kept putting me off.Depp's performance is serviceable but for someone of his ability this is not good enough. For the majority of the film it looks like he has fallen into his hair and he seems just as unnatural within his skin  never able to really draw out a character of any genuine depth. Cruz comes late in the game and does liven things up with a flamboyant performance but she doesn't have any depth either. Support from Liotta is OK but he doesn't manage to do much with a 'working stiff' character and Griffiths just doesn't look old enough for her character. The rest of the cast are OK but really the film is Depp's and it speaks volumes that he doesn't dominate it in the way he has with other films.Overall this is an OK film but it is not slick, engaging or deep enough to be as good as the films that it clearly thinks it can match. The cast all work but don't make much impact and Demme's direction feels copied from other, better, directors. OK but not great.",Null,3,5,25 September 2005
Raging Bull," Classic examination of masculinity
","The story of boxer Jake La Motta from his rising star in the 1940's through to his own downfall and his eventual living on the cabaret circuit in the present day.Scorsese and De Niro  nobody needs say any more.  Whether it be media satire (King of Comedy), small time thugs (Mean Streets) or real gangsta s**t (Goodfellas), the two rarely miss.  This was one of their best to date (and probably for ever).  The story is fascinating in itself but as an examination of masculinity it excels.  The film allows us to watch a man who goes along with all the things he thinks make him a man  even when those characteristics and habits begin to destroy everything he has  his marriage, his realtionships and his career.  Combine this with the gripping boxing tale of ups and downs and you have a film that never outstays it's welcome.Scorsese is on top form  the use of black and white any have been a quality issue, but he uses it well.  The fight scenes are other worldly  exaggerated to the extent that it is breathtaking and more shocking than previous boxing scenes in other movies. My favourite effect is the sound editing in the fights where silence and calm seem to descend just before key moments..amazing.  The relationship stuff is also gripping and Scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us the physical beatings.De Niro is amazing  the method stuff alone is great, but his whole performance is intense.  Similarly Moriaty, Pesci and Frank Vincent are excellent  however they all stand in De Niro's shadow.Overall  an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing..this excels in so many ways  may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century!",Null,77,106,16 March 2002
The Iron Giant," An intelligent and entertaining film with plenty for adults and children
","1957. When a Maine fisherman reports a sighting of a giant metal device from outer space, nobody believes him except for Special Agent Kent Mansley  always one to hunt out any communist plot involving invasion from outer space. However the robot remains elusive to all but young Hogarth Hughes, who finds it in the woods and manages to befriend it  even teaching it basic English. But with the origin and purpose of the robot unknown, is Hogarth right to accept it as a friend or should he fear it? Regardless, Mansley intends to kill it before it kills 'us'.It has been so many years since I read the book as a child, that I was pretty much coming to this with no knowledge of story or what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised by an intelligent film that is wholly entertaining and will please kids and adults. Set in the later fifties, the plot uses the iron giant as an allegory for the unknown and thus presents adults with a well-written criticism of the 'shoot first, questions later' mentality. Being a kids' film it is hardly a debating stand point but it was still intelligently enough done to keep me interested. The main plot is also interesting, with issues of death, birth and purpose all having a bearing on the story and giving food for thought later if you let it. These elements work to make quite a touching film where the giant is taught like a child by Hogarth and it becomes a very warm and likable character.None of this takes away from the film's first function as a kids' movie and as such it produces enough humour, visual excitement and energy to keep the kids happy even if the reference to the Cold War will be almost totally over their heads. The film is moving as much as it is humorous, intelligent as much as it is entertaining and the end result is a very well rounded film. Of course it has problems in that it does go where you expect it to at points, and it does lose its nerve towards the end and ducks the dark but satisfying ending it should have had, but these are minor complaints because the rest of it all works well together to form a really enjoyable animation.In a way I found it quite refreshing to have a kids' cartoon that provided warmth and intelligence for the adult audience to share in; I love stuff like Toy Story etc but their adult stuff is a little knowing and cynical at times (albeit hilariously so!) whereas here I felt that I was being given the same story as the kids and not having separate levels for them and me.The voice cast is good on paper but only a handful of them really get much to do. Marienthal is not the usual sickly sweet kid and he does a good job to make his character come across as convincing. Connick jr is very funny and provides a lot of laughs to the film; likewise McDonald's paranoid agent pretty much steals every scene he is in. I was concerned by the fact that Diesel was the voice of the robot, how would I warm to a character played by a man who struggles to bring any charisma to his other roles I wondered? However the limited dialogue and depth of his voice works well and he did a good job (although I'm sure it amounted to no more than a day in a recording studio). Aniston has little to do and her voice is not that distinctive but minor roles for Mahoney and Walsh add a sense of class with their very well known voices.Overall this is a very enjoyable animation. The plot is intelligent, interesting, moving and humorous at different points and, although some of it go over the kids' heads, it tells the same story to both age groups well.It's all over a bit quick and kids weaned on Pixar may complain about the traditional animation used for the majority of the film but there are only a few minor quibbles about this film and it is definitely worth hunting down. An interesting and entertaining family film that will stick in your mind for what it does and the talking points it leaves.",Null,2,4,17 October 2004
Taken 2," Feels slapped together with little reason other than the need to make a sequel to the very successful original
","You know what you're getting into here – the families of the many, many men that Bryan Mills killed while trying to get his daughter back in the previous film. The title doesn't suggest anything new will occur here since it is presented without subtitle or addition other than the usual numeric addition and this is representative of a film that knows it has to deliver action sequences and violence, but really seems to lack the energy to do it in a way that offers much. We jump right into the plot setup, then get the characters where we need them before then starting a run of driving, fighting and shooting sequences.In terms of just mindlessly doing stuff, the film is not awful and those looking for boxes to be ticked will find them done here – if indeed that is the only request. The first film was not some high art but it had good pace and, although it struggled to link action scenes, it was not totally stupid. In this one very little effort has been made and even when dumb ideas were said out loud in the writer's room, it was clear nobody cared enough to at least try to find something that made sense. The examples are many but my personal favorite is when Bryan and Kim has eluded their pursuers and are heading to the US Embassy for safety – instead of pulling up outside, they decide to ram it with the car so they are 100% inside the Embassy grounds; okay this gives the film another short stunt sequence, however it also makes no sense at all. This sort of stupidity is annoying and even in the moment doesn't work – this isn't a film where you think back later about the stupid narrative, it is a film that you'll do it all the time during.This is a problem because such nonsense breaks the viewer out of the film and stop you just getting into the pace and action; maybe not a big deal if it was occasional but when it is frequent then you have to wonder. The action itself is okay although shot a bit too frantically at times, the problem is that you are never allowed to forget how stupid it all is – and the film really needs to let us do that. The cast seem stuck with it all; Neeson looks a bit bored of it all even though his reinvention as an action hero must be earning him quite a nice crust (hence he will be back yet again for a third Taken). Grace is okay from her side, but the narrative sees her failing her driving test in an automatic but then suddenly able to drive a manual like a rally driver; Janssen is a pretty plot device throughout and generally the generic villains are totally unmemorable whether they are a guy we see for a few seconds, or the main ones.Taken 2 is a film that exists because of economics – the first one made so much money that even with the potential sequel takings drop-off, it still makes sense to make it. This is the main motivation and it shows because everything else feels function and 'good enough', although the problem is that often it isn't. It will provide noise for the background but the nonsense and lazy writing really detracts from it.",Null,0,0,10 May 2014
Step Up," A product that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, excite or appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging
","Tyler Gage is a white kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Helping his friends escape, Tyler is caught red handed smashing up a school of the arts and is sentenced to community service there. While doing janitorial work he sees the ballet students doing their routines and he himself is later observed by one of the students (Nora) doing his street moves with his friends. When Nora's partner goes out with an injury she turns to Tyler to help her, since he has basic skills. Both have their struggles with this working relationship but while Nora opens up Tyler to the possibilities through dance, he brings an unique urban feel to her routine – but as romance blossoms things become harder.I never bothered with this film when it came out but the rising star of Tatum made me step back and take a look at this. What I found was a film that struck me as being a mass produced product rather than being a film that someone created or that the makers really wanted to make. What I mean is that didn't seem to be much in the way of passion or inspiration behind it. The story is a predictable mishmash of other films and you can see so many things from Breakin' through to Save the Last Dance all in the mix here. It is definitely something that knows what it needs to do, does it and doesn't worry too much about making it special, different or anything like that. And so it treads the path you know it will from the first minute and as a story it never rings true so much as just meeting it with a shrug.In fairness though the dance routines are reasonably good and the soundtrack does give it an energy that helps it but both of these things are the type of things that will fade with time as other films supersede it. The cast do the basics as well. Tatum is good in so much as he manages to carry off a white urban caricature without looking ridiculous. In the normal terms he is not 'good' but on these terms he does the job. Dewan is attractive but you never feel the heat between them and their relationship (working or romantic) never seems real. The rest of the cast are pretty much doing what one expects as well – and when even Six Feet Under's Griffiths or The Wire's Lovejoy is calling it in, it hardly seems fair to expect Mario to be doing much.Overall this is a product more than it is a film and as such it is one of those things that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, doesn't excite and doesn't appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging. It is a solid genre film for the viewers it was made for but it is unlikely to stand the test of time well at all or indeed have much appeal to those that want it to do more than tick boxes.",Null,1,1,22 November 2009
The Woman in Black," Obvious regarding the genre standards but still effective and surprisingly chilling
","I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to watching this film – it sat in my queue for quite some time and never appealed. The plot is your standard ghost story / haunted house fare – a tragedy which has resulted in lingering horrors which a new person in town doesn't fully appreciate but, when he does, he tries to make up for the past to make it all stop. There is detail around this but essentially this is what it is and at its base it is familiar. The delivery follows a similar path in terms of what it does, because we have creepy children, creepy dolls, lots of shadows, static figures and half-seen movements.All of this is very much of the genre but yet it is still effective and I was surprised by just how frightening parts of it were – it more than earns the 12A certificate it got in the UK because for sure the intensity and unnerving aspects of it do more than gore or language would do. The film opens with a strong scene of three children who seem compelled to calmly throw themselves to their death out of an attic window. From here the creepiness continues in a similar, understated manner in the way a good ghost story should. Okay it is not breaking new ground with half-seen faces in windows and lots of jump scares as things happen, but it still works well. I watched it with headphones and the impact of the sound design is also important – while it of course does the sudden noises well, the silence is very well captured because it is not just 'no noise' but rather the stillness of waiting for something to happen.Radcliffe leads the film well, convincing in his performance and making for a likable lead – although he has his Potter fame, he doesn't overplay here and (for me at least) his fame didn't distract from me getting into the film. He is well supported by good turns from the supporting cast, but the main work comes from the production design as the house is creepy and is well filmed, lit and captured to have a tangible sense of dread and presence – this is what makes the film as enjoyable as it was. It is still a genre film for sure, but it is one that works well with plenty of atmosphere, chills and scares.",Null,2,3,25 May 2014
Shrek," Plenty for kids and adults alike
","An ogre lives happily in his swamp before he is invaded by a horde of other fairy tale characters fleeing persecution from the evil Lord Farquaad.  In order to clear his swamp of the squatters, Shrek agrees to undergo a quest to rescue a Princess from a dragon and bring her to Farquaad's castle. However on the journey back Shrek and Princess Fiona being to become friends, but can a Princess love an ogre?This is one of the best animated films that I've ever been able to see.  Not only is it really funny but the story is great - it's deep if you want it to be deep, but there's plenty on the surface if you just want that.  The whole thing about true love and love finding it's true form is very moving, and the characters are developed to the extent that you fully believe them (despite them being donkeys, ogres and mini-tyrants!).  In terms of comedy I expected more - but only because I thought it was a spoof film rather than a well plotted fairy tale.  However many bits are really funny, Murphy's Donkey gets the most laughs, but there are plenty of other great scenes that range from adult laughs to people falling down for the kids - the gingerbread man scene being my favourite ('the muffin man?').Like Toy Story this succeeds by having a great story, great characters and a huge number of jokes for adults that are a) clever, b) funny and c) not forced in the least.  This mix makes for a wonderful film.  Mike Myers is great as Shrek - he gets very few jokes, I assumed that he would ham it up, but he plays the sensitive role very well and carries the emotional core of the film.  Murphy is brilliant as the donkey, gets all the best lines and is the best animated character - it's his role to carry the bulk of the comedy. Lithgow is great as Farquaad and the animation just reflects him perfectly. Diaz is OK as Fiona but at times her vocal abilities aren't good enough to bring the character to life.  This is especially evident during Fiona's transformation where the role needed a lot more emotion to win us over.Overall a wonderful film - there aren't many films that can combine great comedy, strong characters, moving and meaningful story and be original and inventive.  To find all these things in a cartoon makes for a great 90 minutes.",Null,5,10,18 December 2001
Vanilla Sky," A lesson in excess Â– not a patch on Abre les Ojos!
","David has everything his heart desires having inherited a huge publishing company from his father at a young age.  With women he trades on his easy charm and good looks Â– stringing as many along as possible without commitment, the build up being as good as the sex that comes with conquest. At a party he avoids one lover, Julie, by striking up a conversation with Sophia Â– going to her home and spending the whole night talking and laughing.  The next morning he leaves her flat to find that Julie is waiting for him.  He gets in her car but during a fight, she crashes Â– killing her and badly disfiguring him.  He struggles with his loss of beauty until a new surgery comes along that offers the chance of restoring his looks Â– however it also messes with his mind to the extent that he appears to mix dreams and reality.  David tells his story to McCabe during a physiological review that will set the basis for his plea during his impending murder trial.To set out my stall Â– I saw Abre Los Ojos before I saw Vanilla Sky.  I say this because I imagine that most negative reviews come from those who have seen the original and most good reviews come from those who have not seen it at all.  I don't intend to buck this trend.I can't criticize the story because at heart, it is a good story.  It is a little complex and dark, but it's a compelling, disorientating story none the less.  But we know this already Â– we saw it in the original movie (which I gave a 9 out of 10!).  So that Vanilla Sky has a good story at it's heart is maybe not quite so remarkable a feat.  Crow monkeys with the story slightly  and alters the mood of the ending just enough to be irritating to those of us who didn't see any flaws that needed fixing Â– but this is a remake not a copy and that's his right.However he does tend to copy the original scene for scene Â– in some cases shot for shot, again that's not a big problem for me as he simple seems to be saying that he can't improve on what has gone before and hence won't even try.  No Â– my main problem is with the adding of stuff.  Vanilla Sky runs about 20/30 minutes longer than the original and it's in this padding that I had a problem.  The film knows that an American audience is not used to thinking things out for itself Â– hence we have constant references to Benny the dog etc, almost as if we're not smart enough to make the connections ourselves.  The padding doesn't add anything of value Â– it extends scenes needlessly and adds baggage to scenes that were fine in the first place. The perfect example being the nightmare scene at the start with an empty Manhattan Â– Crow fills this with quickly cut visuals like a pop video, taking away from the tension of the scene.In the reviews for this all anyone seemed to be shouting about was what an awesome soundtrack Crow had put together and, yes, it is made up of a diverse range of very good songs Â– however a soundtrack is not just about making a CD that's going to sell, it needs to work in the movie.  Here Â– it doesn't work at all.  Almost all the music seems out of place Â– as if someone in the cinema had just turned on their stereo.  The scene where David discovers what's really going on was sickeningly tense in the original Â– here it is smothered by the Beach Boy's `Good Vibrations', does anyone think this scene works?  That's one example but there are plenty of others where the music destroys any sense of mood and just seems out of place.The mood is another problem Â– the original was very dark.  Here the mood is quite upbeat, very Hollywood.  The soundtrack doesn't help but it's made worse by the performances.  When Noriega played David/Cesar, he wasn't a totally likeable character Â– unloving, vain and with a smarmy charm Â– after the accident he was pathetic and desperate.  Cruise comes across like a movie star rather than a person Â– he seems to want to flash his well built chest and beautiful smile in every scene, this stops us noticing his failings as a person because his character seems to stop at the smile. After the accident Cruise doesn't want to become pathetic or desperate Â– instead he clowns in a half pathetic way but never lets his character be pushed to the very edge for any length of time Â– this stops us caring about him, he just doesn't seem a real person.  The other Cruz is ok, but never as good as in the original.  Here the overall upbeat mood of the film seems to have gotten to her and she smiles her way through it Â– we barely see her trapped by the disfigured David who looks to her for support and her happy performance at the end totally changes the mood.  I love Jason Lee but he just seems out of place here but he is the only one of the leads who actually manages to convince when the mood goes from comedy to anger and resentment.  Kurt Russell is good but in the original the Doctor had a huge emotional punch at the end Â– here Russell doesn't do well with this scene and makes his role a damp squid.I could go on for days, but overall the main problem with this is that Crow can't improve on the original.  All he can do is add material that pads out the story unnecessarily.  Vanilla Sky is American excess Â– a remake of a film that didn't need anything added to it. 4 out of 10.",Null,11,21,19 March 2002
X-Men: First Class," Solid effects-driven blockbuster, but that's about it
","Having paid more than my fair share of inflated cinema tickets to see hyped blockbuster movies based on special effects, I'm more and more happy to wait rather than go sit in a crowded noisy room to see the latest one, which is why I decided to watch the recent X-Men reboot/prequel on DVD rather than in the cinema. I had heard reasonable things though, so I was quite looking forward to it and hoping that the franchise reboot would do more than simply move earlier in the story. I may have hoped this but of course this is not really what it does â€“ the step back in time simply presses the reset button on the characters so the writers no longer need to worry about the back-story of the previous films. This may sound cynical but this is what the film is doing â€“ not adding anything by the shift in time, just getting rid of expensive actors, messy plots and also getting viewers back into the cinema after the third film started to put them off.How much of a problem is this lack of innovation? Well, to be honest, not much if you are coming to the film knowing what you're getting into. What this means is that this is not a film that is exploring characters because it wants to â€“ it is building characters because it wants to sell tickets and that is clear from the start since everything is pretty basic on the character side â€“ indeed it never feels more relaxed than when it is able to go into a montage and develop characters that way. The good side of this is that it does want to spend lots of money on special effects and mostly these are up on the screen in rather silly and overblown effects shots. The various powers of the characters are where these effects come into play and they are as variable as the powers; so in some cases the effects are impressive and add to the action of the scene â€“ in other cases no amount of effects can make the powers be good (a stripper with wings isn't a 'power', it simply means she might get more tips). The plot does allow for plenty of good action even though the plot is pretty much the same one all the films have at their core â€“ it really doesn't do much more than provide a frame.The new cast never quite get to the level of the adult equivalents, even though there is some real talent here. McAvoy and Fassbender both do solid work in their roles but they fall awkwardly between being younger as characters while also trying to have the gravitas of their previous versions. Bacon is OK but never as much of a threat as he needed to be while January Jones just strides round in her pants, presumably wondering how many years of really good turns she has to give in Mad Men before someone else will give her a good role. Lawrence, Bryne, Hoult and others are all OK in their roles but the downside of all these younger actors is that this doesn't feel like a big franchise sequel/prequel so much as it feels like a cheaper version of the proper films.That said it still delivers what it needs to do â€“ which is special effects that provide value for money. The plot and characters don't offer much more than a frame for these, but they are not awful, just obvious. A solid big-budget superhero movie then, but not one that does much more than the minimum in regards plot, characters and tone.",Null,1,2,30 September 2012
The Wolverine," Solidly enjoyable even if it is not as memorable as it should have been
","I'm not sure if this film counts as sequel or a reboot or what but it certainly feels like another run at making a Wolverine film rather than a sequel to the first attempt at it. From the very start the tone is noticeably darker which I guess is to try and placate fans who don't like the family friendly version of the character that was more or less served up before. Although this dark edge isn't really present in more than the mood, it is a more satisfying tone to the film and it engaged me more as a result. The second thing it did well was to set the vast majority of the film in Japan and to blend the reality of the country (tradition, bullet trains, pachinko arcades) with the version that will appeal to the target audience comic book fans (beautiful women, samurai, ninjas etc).This setting gives the film an sense of cool that matches that of its central character and of course of its main star. This cool factor helps it a lot because the plotting is not particularly strong; good enough to frame the film but nothing special. Unfortunately the same can be said about the action. It is perfectly fine for what it is but in terms of action sequences there was only really one scene that I felt was pushing me and showed ambition and this was the action spreading out across Tokyo in the daytime. Outside of this there are some good martial arts scenes and then lots of CGI nonsense – all of which was fine but no more than this. I enjoyed the film but I never got away from the sense that this was a very careful film; the reaction to the previous had not been great and it felt like it was really making effort to not mess things up. This lack of real flair or risk taking was apparent and, while not enough to really hurt the film, certainly didn't see it excel.The cast are as reliable as the film as a whole. Jackman is as good as Wolverine as he has ever been and he makes the most of his haunted and violent character; it really is a character that he was born to fit. Looking like she came right out of a graphic novel, Fukushima is a cool presence as 'bodyguard' Yukio while Okamotois suitably fragile. Outside of this Will Yun Lee is cool in a rather obvious character but is underused. Khodchenkova does feel a little like someone who wouldn't have made the cut into the main X-Men movies and she didn't have the sexual presence that the film needed, even if she had the looks. The supporting cast of Japanese standard characters are fine and do what is asked of them.The Wolverine is a solid, safe film which is enjoyable for what it does even if I would have liked more from it. It plays things safe for the most part, giving the viewer more or less what they expect but not pushing things beyond that. It'll do the job but it never has the style, flair, imagination or cruelty that I had hoped it would bring.",Null,2,3,23 November 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Impacting as a spectacle but jumps around a bit too much and could have benefit from a bit more focus (MAJOR SPOILERS)
","Having enjoyed the previous two films as much as I did, I was looking forward to this film so much that I decided to go to a cinema rather than wait for DVD, despite my general dislike of the multiplex experience. True to form we watched this film in the Odeon with a good handful of people chatting all the way through it and of course one woman who refused to turn her phone off or even onto silent even after it had rung for the third time during the near-silent scene in which Batman flies the nuclear bomb away from Gotham (and the pre-film adverts suggest that it is piracy that is putting people off going to the multiplex). Anyway, despite all this i was still glad to have gone to the cinema to see this as visually it is very impressive and does deserve to be seen on the big screen due to its strength as an out and out spectacle because it does look as good as the previous films.Unfortunately in many ways DKR is the least of the three Nolan Batman films as it doesn't all deliver as it should. As before the film wears a heavy Gothic air to it that sets it far away from the more cartoony comic book movies and at the start of the film I quite liked that it did seem to take its time and let Wayne's physical and emotional seclusion breathe as a subject. However it is not long before there isn't the material to really support the very serious air and there are times where it feels a little superficial, like it is unable to not take itself so seriously. This gets harder as the film quickly gets to a point where it has very little time to do anything. Character development (beyond that which we already know) is gone, even motivations are skimmed and the story telling has very little room and ends up having plenty of convenience (such as characters finding each other without any logical way of being in the same place so easily) and also scenes without any bridge of any form (scene 1, Bruce Wayne climbs out of a prison somewhere in the world, scene 2, Bruce Wayne is in Gotham and bumps into Selina). None of these were major problems in themselves, but it made the film feel rushed and perhaps a little half done.As a story it was a little too simplistic and had too much going on; I understand the desire to link everything back to the other films but there are several characters I could have done without. Catwoman is poorly developed while the twist of the villainess at the end not only hurts Bane's standing but also seem unnecessary as an addition. Bane's mission offers much but doesn't have the menace or impact it should have and this also had an impact on him as a character. Bane is physically imposing and smart with it, but he doesn't have the menace that the Joker had in the previous film – OK, this is a comparison that I'm making, but it is hard not to make it while watching. The voice doesn't help as it is sometimes difficult to fully make out what was said, while also being a little comical because he sounds like The Elephant Man. Tom Hardy was the right man for the job though (those who saw him in Bronson know he can fearlessly do chaos and violent threat) but he isn't used as well as he could have been. The rest of the cast are mixed; Bale is good and his Batman voice is less of an issue. Gordon-Levitt helps with the action but his character is poor and he coasts on his own charisma (which is nearly enough). Hathaway is OK but again too superficial. Cotillard rounds out an Inception heavy cast. The smaller roles feature a lot of faces, which at times gets distracting whether it is larger smaller roles (Modine, Freeman) or the smallest ones (him from Dexter, them from The Wire etc).I have sounded negative here but I did enough DKR as a spectacle of noise and darkness – I liked what it was aiming at and I liked that it fitted into the trilogy thematically. However it is flawed; it has too much to do in too little time and would have been better doing a little less as it would have gotten more from its characters if it had fewer of them. DKR still delivers what the previous films had delivered, but just not as well. Still better than many garish comic book blockbusters, just not as good as the bar it set for itself.",Null,9,18,12 August 2012
Black Panther," Slick and entertaining even if interesting elements are impacted by the superficial sheen of the bigger franchise
","This film was very well received and praised by critics on arrival. The cynic in me still believes that the social importance of the film means that many people were willing it to success even before seeing it. To be fair, the film is a good standalone entry in the Marvel universe of films, but at the same time it is still a film in the franchise - not some magically new type of beast. The high percentage of the cast who are black and positive characters is probably the most obvious thing highlighted by the critics, although it does seem like window dressing at times, with the African culture laid on thick on everything. Interestingly, the film reinforces negative images of African-Americans through the view characters from this specific group - not overly so, but enough to notice as it clashes with the main presentation.Outside of its value as social tool, to show studios yet again that they should not assume what they assume about their mass audience, the film itself is fun, lively and mostly interesting. The plot has good pace and nice developments, although it is not as morally murky as it could have been. Some of the cast do play to this aspect, but the film never really wants to be in a grey area so much as to have clear goodies and baddies. The action sequences are good and play out with the usual humor and high production standards. The cast is well led by Boseman, who has charisma and presence. He is very well supported by a deep cast - with Jordan in particular making a great 'villain'. Ironic in a film praised in America for being a positive challenge to the sort of 'OscarSoWhite' world of Hollywood, that so many of the cast are British but regardless so many people are good here with few weak links.In the end it is still a Marvel franchise film, and first and foremost it does what this needs and does it well. The social aspects are important, but not while you're watching it - which is fine because it is enjoyable and slick enough to hold the attention and be worth a look.",Null,1,1,27 August 2018
Any Given Sunday," Media overload that maybe lacks a bit of substance
","In the modern world of American Football money drives teams, greed and arrogance drives players and boundaries are pushed in terms of physical and mental limits in an attempt to get the money.  Coach Tony D'Amato finds himself in charge of a Shark's team that is on a 3 game losing streak before losing it's 2 lead QB's.  With Willie Beamen leading the plays and growing in arrogance, Tony finds it hard to hold his team together, meanwhile the owners are pushing for TV money and new stadium deals.As we all know most Oliver Stone films are like having Stone himself standing shouting at you for 2 hours.  Here the effect is the same  even if the message is confused a little.  We all know that US sport is more business than sport and we know that it's not all as good, honest stuff as it should be.  Here Stone makes his point but also tries to mix in other stories more at home in a standard sports movie  the clichés of overcoming, of team spirit etc.  However both work reasonably well.  However the main driving force behind the film is Stone.Despite getting as many cameos in as he can (as a commentator and his picture on a bar wall) Stone delivers a powerful directing job.  He uses plenty of visual tricks and never lets the camera rest too easily.  Likewise the soundtrack is constant and contains plenty of hot tracks.  It's all very exhilarating and mostly makes up for a lack of real substance in the stories.  The only downside is that this is quite exhausting  it's very loud and just feels a touch too busy to be enjoyable.The cast are good despite the fact that they seem to want to watch Stone's in-yer-face direction style.  Pacino gives it plenty of `hoo-hah' but struggles in the quieter moments.  Diaz is alright but is a bit out of her depth.  Nobody does loud, arrogant and irritating like Foxx, the only problem being he is very annoying most of the time.  Woods and Modine are good as doctors with varied degrees of realism/cynicism.  The support cast is all good  even if they don't all have much to do.  LL Cool J is good, Charlton Heston barely says a word and is only there to show the `modern day gladiators' theme, Lela Rochon is as beautiful as ever and does well with little material, Berkley is there presumably because she needs the work and has no problem showing her breasts (as long as she doesn't have to have sex with Kyle McLaughin).  Jim Brown, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Aaron Eckhart, John C McGinley etc are all good and help give weight to the film.Overall it's all very loud and in your face but it's enjoyable  even if it leaves you feeling tired at the end! Oh  and it's `American Football' not `Football'  the rest of the world knows what football is and it's not just a bunch of men falling down every few minutes (unless you're Italian or Brazilian then falling down is what it's all about).",Null,3,11,8 June 2002
Iron Man," Far from a brilliant film but still a bright, breezy and enjoyable summer blockbuster
","Growing up, Tony Stark was always good with machines  very good. This pleased his father, who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young, the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but, at 21, Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and, it must be said, something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out, but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board, but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and, unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun, with good action sequences, comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie  which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is, as good as some of them are, we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four, if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the 'developmental' film is generally the 'easiest' one to get right), fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark  I mean, I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end, the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the 'conclusion'. It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark, who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part, even if not that much is made of him, while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but, while not anything special, he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment, Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action, some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.",Null,10,22,11 September 2008
Mother!," Difficult film which does hold the attention despite not helping the viewer that much (SPOILERS)
","Mark Kermode liked but warned over this film, that the viewer should not step away too long because the film can easily change and it will be almost impossible to explain why the shift occurred in their absence. To be fair, it is sometimes hard to explain even when you stay with it. By the end, it is very clear, tidy, and quite satisfying - but you really have to stick with it.This is the problem of the film; too much of its time seems to be spent not involving the viewer in the game being played. At first it starts out as a sort of home-invasion film, where a man arrives into the otherwise peaceful lives of a couple, and soon the events around this man and his family start to get out of control. The success as a writer of the man of the couple leads to more people coming, further stressing the woman. It is not too long before bloody wounds are opening up in floors, full riots are occurring in the front room, and the end of society appears to be occurring as a result of a simple promotional event for a book. It is quite a ride as a film but, while it ends up being quite cleverly done and clear, it doesn't help you as you watch it. However, on the flip side of that, if you go in knowing it is all a biblical allegory which plays the creation story out to its complete end, then probably it would be too obvious in too many moments. It is a difficult balancing act and the film doesn't pull it off.As a result it is bewildering, likely to have people give up, and certainly put off the people who would otherwise have flooded to watch the same story played out in a more 'normal' fashion. As I understood what I was watching (late in the final acts) I did appreciate it more for doing something different with something so fundamental, even if it left me on the outside for the majority. While on the outside, the quality of the delivery and the intrigue of what is going on was still enough to keep me watching, but I understand that for others it won't.The performances are strong and all involved deserve credit for doing something so unusual in a 'mainstream' film. Lawrence is great throughout, and has plenty of strong support from Harris, and Pfeiffer, as well as many other familiar faces. The film is all Aronofsky though; his vision and creativity of delivery. While it is difficult it is hard not to be impressed by the scale of what he does in such a small place, and how well he makes it work - for all its faults, you can't claim that Mother! isn't trying. I doubt I'll watch it again, but as I watching it was mysterious and weird for just a bit too long before it then rode its luck on being bewilderingly bananas before then delivering an explanation which is obvious in retrospect, but still provides a satisfying way to close out the film.",Null,1,2,24 March 2018
Creed II," The boxing action is solid, and the performances strong, but too much is soapy, and better opportunities are missed
","In terms of the franchise, this is I think 'Rocky 8' or something like that, so I didn't come to it expecting it to be fresh and original. I expected it to produce good fights, with growing tension, and a big payoff - and for it to do enough around that with the drama to support my investment in the characters. Broadly, the film does this, but it doesn't do it well - only 'okay'.In terms of the boxing scenes, I was surprised by how they didn't replicate the best of the franchise, and some felt surprisingly flat and lacking in build/tension. They are professionally done, and they have the elements they needed, but I didn't feel the drama or the rush of the conclusion like I have with previous films, and with some real fights. This feeling of it being a lesser copy of something better rings true in the rest of the film too; the training sequences, the personal dramas - they all feel very obvious and lacking a spark, much like a faded copy. In the drama the reference points of proposals, births, personal struggles etc are fairly generically written, but my biggest issue is that the writing squanders a lot of better stuff to give time to these elements. Specifically I mean the struggle of the Drago's as men, and as father/son; the anger, resentment, longing, and missed life in both of them is right there, and when we have time with them it is very well delivered - but far too little. Instead we get direct dialogue between characters, people talking to graves etc - material used before and nothing much added by it. I'm not suggesting the film branches out to explore the Russian characters, but certainly there was more to be had here.For the rest, it all benefits from a strong cast. Stallone does his usual stuff to good effect, but Jordan makes way more of the material than is on the page. Thompson doesn't do as well but to be fair she is poorly served. I was impressed by Lundgren and Munteanu, in particular how much the latter did with so little. Okay they are not the most complex characters but with a lot of body language and face work they show years of pain and anger, the impact on them as people, and on them as father/son; like I said, I really wanted more on this. Behind the camera I wondered what had changed, and the lack of Coogler seems the most obvious; I did not know the name of director Caple Jnr, and there doesn't seem to be much on his resume to suggest that will change, or that he would have done anything with Creed II other than a workmanlike job.The film produces enough of the cliché to provide some entertainment value there, but at the same time it does little more than this. The drama is soapy but at the same time much more interesting material is left to small touches, and the boxing action is professionally done, but doesn't have the drama and building tension of the best of the franchise.",Null,0,1,2 June 2019
Blade Runner," Comments on Director's Cut
","Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existences in a detective thriller.  The Director's Cut adds a whole new element that many people suspected from the original but makes it clear that this is what we're meant to think.The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Penn are good in their roles, but Rutgar Hower is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  Ford's wooden style fits in well with the cold city that he lives in and also lends itself to the fact that Ford may not be everything he seems.This is the version that we should have seen years ago - it allows us to follow the story ourselves without the voiceover having to lead us by the hand.  The main addition of Ford's unicorn dreams opens up a whole new element to the film and throws up plenty to talk about once it is finished. A beautiful looking film that, thanks to this cut, has plenty of substance to match the visual flair.",Null,5,11,29 October 2001

Ford and Young's wooden acting styles fit in fine with the film, but in this version the bleak vision of the future is the true star.

Bruce Almighty," Very slight film that is almost totally carried by Carrey  although even he wears a bit
","Bruce is a reporter chasing the job of anchorman at his station.  When he is passed over yet again he rages at a God who allows so many bad things to happen in his life.  God decides to teach him the difficulty of his job and also the downside of giving man freewill by giving Bruce the powers of God for a short while.  Initially happy with the ability to use his powers to his own benefit, Bruce quickly learns there is more to it than just magic tricks.Having seen the trailer I assumed that this was going to be a really funny film and to it's credit, it almost manages to be for a lot of the film, but this is not so much to do with the plot as it is to do with Jim Carrey's delivery.  The plot is quite lazy and it isn't clear totally what the moral of the story is  even at the end I wasn't totally sure that the film knew what point it was making  that we have the power to do miracles, that God is busy, that being God is hard, that selfishness is wrong?  Well  it could be all of these as the film never nails it down.  The film's best bits are where Bruce is allowed to run wild with his new powers and after this the film sags a bit as it then starts to look for something resembling a plot to try and form an ending around.The film drops in a scene from It's A Wonderful Life, which gives you a clue as to what it is trying to be  it wants to be a warm fuzzy feelgood film too like Capra managed.  It is worth noting that the classic Capra we have today were not so warmly received at time of release so perhaps that isn't too good an aspiration.  It never manages to pull that off anyway as the moral is where the warmth should come form and, as I said, this bit is muddled.  The film is strongest when it relies on Carrey to deliver the goods and he does.For the vast majority of the film, Carrey's mugging saves the day and he makes the material funnier with his delivery.  After a while his catch phrases wear a bit tired (`B.E.A  utiful' started to annoy me) but mostly he is funny.  The funniest line in the whole thing for me was when God said `alrightie then' in the style of Ace Ventura  but I think I was alone in that as no one else in the cinema laughed.  Beside Carrey the rest of the cast are mere background for him to bounce off  only his scenes with Freeman appear to share equal weight and Freeman brings a good air to the role  not trivialising the role but not allowing it to be heavy to the point of killing the film.  Aniston is OK but is really just there to provide a plot for the final third of the film.  Hall is solid and gives the impression of the support cast being quality in numbers.Regardless of the fact that this film is mainly one big sketch (man gets God's powers) with a bit of a plot tacked on at the end to justify a film, it is actually quite enjoyable.  If you dislike Carrey's mugging then there is very little else here for you, but his energy and delivery save the film even if he does misjudge some of his dialogue and jokes.",Null,4,9,22 June 2003
Mr. Holland's Opus," Good story for the unsung heroes of life  touching without being sickly sentimental
","Glenn Holland is a young composer.  In the fifties he stops touring with his band to teach music in a school which he hopes will free him from touring to allow him to work on his main love of composing his own music.  Despite initially hating his job, Holland soon learns to enjoy it and how best to communicate the love of music to his pupils.  We trace his life over 30-40years as he has a son with his wife and goes through great emotional times while putting his personal dreams to one side.Although this had `sentimental life lesson film' written all over it, I still wanted to give it a go and strangely still enjoyed it.  The film is very much a bit of praise for all those who are unsung heroes in there lives and it had the potential to be really sickly sentimental.  Happily a good script manages to avoid this for the majority of the time.The weakness of the film is the fact it that it does try to cover a lifetime and occasionally there isn't enough plot to do that well.  I know it would have been difficult but I do feel that the film could have been either a little tighter or filled to overflowing with plot to make it feel shorter. As it is it is still enjoyable but it does feel a little wandering at times  but I guess that's like life in a way.  When the climax comes though it is hard not to be a little moved by the lesson that the film is teaching us.However, the reason for the success of the film is also the reason for it's Oscar nomination  Richard Dreyfuss on good form.  He kept me watching even when the material was stretched.  He is totally believable in the role  for a microcosm of his performance watch his face when the announcement is made about the surprise they have prepared for him  his emotion got me right away!  He deserved his nomination for this as he is captivating over the whole film.  He even ages very convincingly and make up should be congratulated.  However while makeup were concentrating on Dreyfuss they totally forgot about Headly who doesn't age a bit until the final time period (apart from looking a bit tired).  She is badly miscast and she doesn't fit the role at all.  Thomas, Macy, Dukakis and Anderson (as the teenage Cole) all do well in support  but this is Dreyfuss' movie.Overall I enjoyed this.  I usually struggle with things like this because they pile the sentiment on thick like a daytime TVM.  Happily this script avoids that are the majority of the flaws are compensated for by a strong performance from Dreyfuss.",Null,33,41,11 May 2003
Casino Royale," An impressively dark, engaging and exciting entry in the Bond series  just what it needed after Die Another Day
","Having just achieved his 00 status, James Bond is assigned to uncover a plot by tracking a bomber for hire. The mission could not go worse as Bond kills the man in an embassy in front of CCTV cameras. Removed from the mission by M, Bond nevertheless follows the only lead he has to Miami where he finds himself working round the edges of a plot by criminal Le Chiffre to invest his clients money in the stock market just before an engineered event should send shares in a direction favourable for him.After the poor CGI and overblown (if fun) affair that was Die Another Day, the series was at risk of just throwing more and more money at the screen in an attempt to exaggerate and increase the Bond formula to keep fans happy. And, in fairness it seems financially to be working for them but this is not to say that the drastically scaled back feel of Casino Royale is not a welcome change of direction for the series, because for me it most certainly was. Opening with a gritty, short and violent pre-credit sequence, the film moves through a cool title sequence with a typically Bondian (if only so-so) theme song. The film then immediately marks itself out as a step away from the previous film by launching on a great action sequence that is as overblown as the series requires but yet is all the better for seeming real  no ropy Die Another Day CGI here. Casting free-runner Foucan was a great move and this sequence was the high for me. After this the film develops nicely with a solid plot that engaged me easily enough, with interesting characters along the way.Of course this isn't to say that the series has suddenly put out an introspective character piece, because the world of Bond is all still here. So we have superhuman stunts, gadgets (albeit a practical self-defibrillator as opposed to a mini-helicopter) and the usual types of characters going the way we expect. Those expecting this self-styled 'reboot' to provide a depth and emotion that isn't there will be disappointed but regardless this does the Bond formula well  fans will enjoy it and those that were turned off by Die Another Day will find it a welcome return to darker territory. With all the fanboys tired from bemoaning Craig, it is nice to actually see for ourselves what he can do and mostly he is very good. He convinces as a heartless killer and has the presence that suggests that he could do ruthless damage if he had to. I was a bit put off by how regularly he pouts but generally he brings a gravitas to the character that it benefits from. Green is a pretty good Bond girl and brings much, much more to the role than Berry did in the last film. Mikkelsen is a good foil for Bond and is given more interest by his lack of stature (he is essentially facing his last role of the dice in several ways). Dench is as solid as ever while Wright makes a shrewd move in a small character that offers more of the same for a few years to come.Overall then this is not the brilliant, flawless film that many have claimed, but I completely understand why it has been greeted with such praise. Sat beside Die Another Day, it is a wonderfully dark and brooding Bond with great action replacing some of the CGI and gadget excesses of recent times. Those upset at his blue eyes are best left fuming on the net, because Craig is a great Bond  capable of being dark with the violence and offering the potential for more if the material comes to meet him. A refreshing film with the bond formula in place but with a dark and comparatively restrained tone that makes it realistic enough to get into while still existing in the spy fantasy world.",Null,31,45,11 December 2006
Toy Story 3," Not hilarious but just an excellent all-round film with poignancy, adventure, comedy and drama in one wonderfully animated package
","It was during a recent trip back home to Northern Ireland to see my parents that I ended up seeing Toy Story 3 – a film I had been looking forward to seeing for a while. This meant that the film was in 2D (which I was fine with – not a big 3D fan) but also on a smaller than average screen, which irritated me a little given that it was in combination with my parents desire to sit far from the screen. During the trailers I was a bit annoyed by this as I felt the film was a mile away and I thought this would contribute to me feeling remote from the film itself.This worry failed to materialise because very quickly I was thoroughly engaged with enjoying the main feature. It has been years since I saw either of the first two films but I remember them being very strong indeed and this second sequel offers more of the same in terms of quality storytelling and production. I seem to remember the other two films having more big laughs and more rapid fire comedy to them, but this might just be my memory. TS3 is not as hilarious as I had expected it to be, but it does still manage to be funny with plenty to laugh at in the detail, the ideas and the dialogue. More than comedy though the story is the all and it is not only very well written but also very well realised and delivered.Although I did not cry (as many critics claim to have done) I did find the film to contain just the right amount of poignancy and for it to be done in the right way so that it is touching and personal without becoming obvious or cloying. Aside from this though the main thrust of the film is an adventure with moments of thrills, genuinely dramatic moments and one specific scene (in the incinerator) which is incredibly dark considering this is a child's film (dark in a good way, not disturbing or bad). It is impossible to put I on one thing but it is telling that, considering the sheer technological feat that is your average Pixar film, one almost forgets the animation simply because of how good the story and storytelling are.Of course the animation should not be forgotten because it is excellent. Not only is it technically impressive but it is rich in detail and done in a way that deserves awards for cinematography, lighting and set design if it was not for the fact it is all animated. In fact both the animation and storytelling compliment each other perfectly simply because the animation is so good it allows the viewer to totally accept the world of the narrative while the narrative is strong enough to prevent us being focused on the technical aspects. Within all this it would be equally easy to forget the voice cast simply because so much of the performance is done on the faces and body language of the characters (which is back to the animation again). Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Harris, Rickles, Shawn, Ratzenberger and all the usual cast do great work yet again to deliver the emotions as well as the wit, Hanks in particular is great as he has to carry a lot of that. Keaton and Beatty are the standouts from the new voices but the use of Dalton, Goldberg, Garlin and others is also welcome.Toy Story 3 is yet another triumph from Pixar – a stable that makes it look easy almost every time. At a time when film franchises are make a third film simply so they can make a 3D film, the Toy Story series do not let the standard drop even slightly and produce a very strong film across the board, from technical to storytelling. Who would have thought that one of the best film trilogies made would be a family cartoon about toys that come to life when the humans leave the room?",Null,2,4,22 August 2010
Trainspotting," Hilarious, imaginative and very anti-drugs
","Renton is a heroin addict.  He is one of a group of friends who live their lives day to day and hit to hit.  When he tries to kick the habit he manages it for a while but eventually falls back into his old way.  Meanwhile his friends are as messed up as he is, whether it be Spud's pathetic addiction, Begbie's violent rages or the fact that he is sleeping with a girl who still goes to school.When it came out this film was very hyped, the poster became a must-have on every student's bedroom wall and the media went nuts over it's supposed glamorisation of drug use.  The plot is very difficult to summarise, as it doesn't really have a narrative flow other than the very disjointed experience of Renton.  However it manages to be very funny and imaginative all the way, using many different tricks and touches to be funny.  The dialogue is very well written and I must admit I found it a lot funnier than the last few comedies I watched.The media may have condemned this film as promoting drug use, but I can only imagine that they watched a different film from me.  Sure, the film shows drugs as being fun and enjoyable but, like Renton says, `why else would we do it?'  However the film clearly shows a massive downside where people's lives are destroyed, people OD and lives go day to day just trying to get high.  True, it does show this downside in a stylish and funny way but there is no question that the film is promoting drug use in any sense.Too often I see films that are style over substance; Trainspotting gets it just perfect, stylish but not at the expense of dialogue, character or film. It is helped by a great cast.  McGregor jumped to stardom off the back of this role and he deserved it.  He keeps his character both likeable but repulsive at the same time and carries the film with surprising ease.  The support cast is excellent, even if they lack the same good character of Renton.  Whether it is the comic Bremner, the violent Carlyle or the tragic McKidd.  While not all their characters are well developed, they do all give good accounts of themselves, whether it is comic or showing the effects of heroin on their lives.Overall this is a great film that is refreshing to see now without all the `cult student cool' hype or media feeding frenzy over it's supposed pro-drug approach.  It is stylish, funny, depressing and downright sobering.",Null,228,285,20 January 2004
Space Jam," Good cartoon with plenty for adults  more than just selling products
","A group of aliens arrive in Loony Tune world and challenge the inhabitants to a battle for the ownership of that world.  Seeing the aliens are tiny, Bugs Bunny decides a game of basketball should be easily won.  However the aliens steal the talent from several NBA players and look set to win easily. However Bugs and Daffy kidnap Michael Jordan and ask for his help.At the time of release I must admit that I wasn't keen on seeing this film as the whole merchandising thing had left me with a sour taste in my mouth, putting me off the film.  Happy Meals and such were everywhere!  Later I saw it on TV, away from all the hype and found it enjoyable but not great.  The plot is silly, but who cares  it's a cartoon.  The comedy is good and has plenty for kids with the cartoon characters doing cartoon things, but also for adults.  The film is full of in-jokes for adults ranging from a 3 second spoof of Pulp Fiction to some really funny lines  `oh great, no one told me Dan Aykroyd was in this film' when Bill Murray makes an appearance, was my favourite.  Also as a big basketball (and Knick) fan it was fun to have tonnes of basketball stars make fun of themselves as well.However it is a cartoon at heart and I imagine that those who don't like pratfalls etc and aren't basketball fans won't be laughing all the time. Also, surprisingly for Jordan's first film, the basketball action is pretty poor.  I know it didn't have to be realistic but the great man is amazing enough in action without giving him amazing rubber arms etc with special effects.Jordan is good and is a better actor than others I've seen, but he is only playing himself and not that naturally either!  The support cast is where the money is and they all work well.  Whether it be the cartoon characters or adults they all do what they have to.  De Vito is funny and Randle is sexy but as usual Murray steals each and every scene he is in!Overall this manages to be more than a sales drive for Happy Meals (although the McDonalds product placement is a bit tasteless  hey! Just like the burgers!) and is an enjoyable film.  The kids will be happy with the cartoon element and most adults will like the in-jokes and the NBA players making jokes at their expense.",Null,19,29,30 December 2002
Bull Durham," Enjoyable film if not totally successful
","The Durham Bulls are a minor league baseball team who draft in a rookie pitcher who has an arm that holds promise for the majors, sadly his powerful arm lacks finesse.  The team bring in veteran catcher Crash Davis to coach him, while rookie `Nuke' LaLoosh is also taken on by Annie Savoy, who makes it a habit to seduce one player a season.  However Crash also has an eye for Annie.It has been a few years since I lasted watched this film and, partly due to the age I was when it came out, I have always had the idea in my head that it is a `great film'.  This idea is not totally unfounded as the film is pretty enjoyable although falling far from being brilliant.  What makes it stand out for me is the amusing mix of romance and baseball  both parts being done pretty well.  Working best is the sports movie which is affectionate and nostalgic towards America's minor leagues and the men who play all their lives in them.  The romantic side doesn't work quite as well and only is given free reign in the final 15 minutes.  Annie's babbling of Whitman and astro-physics is a little of a turn off for me and I found it harder to care about the romance as a result.The relationship between the two men is stronger though and makes for an more enjoyable dynamic around the baseball diamond.  Although the romantic side is a little weaker, it is hard to imagine the film with one or other of the strands missing and the two give the film an unique spin.The cast is good all round.  Costner (for he was once great) has an easy charm as Crash which belies the fact that several lines of his dialogue are awfully cheesy.  Robbins looks so very different viewed with an eye for his present incarnation, but he is pretty good.  However it is harder to buy his dumb-kid routine when we know him to be a much smarter man  and his supposed `unequal' relationship with Sarandon seems more likely now that he's with her in real life.  Sarandon is OK but I didn't like her character. She is sexy but I never understood totally what a woman with such intelligence would be sleeping with baseball players for  even if she is a big fan.  Some of her lines are poor too, and she sounds like she's just been given big words to say.Overall this is an enjoyable movie but certainly not a great film as either a romance or a sports movie.  Costner is on good form and the baseball banter is good fun even for those who think it's just a fancy version of rounders.",Null,1,3,3 August 2003
Signs," Intriguing but overly deliberate
","Graham Hess is a preacher turned farmer since the death of his wife 6 months prior shattered his faith in the idea of God being in control and all things happening for his reasons.  When his children awake to find a massive corn circle outside their house, Graham assumes practical jokers.  When he sees men running outside his house at night he is sure of it.  However when they begin to occur all over the world and are soon followed by global sightings of both crafts and aliens, he begins to realise what is going on, although the reasons behind it are unclear.When it came out, Signs got so trashed by the majority of critics and imdb users that I decided to skip it.  When friends got it out on DVD I was glad of the chance to see it, but wary that it may not have too much to offer.  I was surprised that I enjoyed it, but I could also see why so many people had major problems with it.  The plot is intriguing from scene one and only builds bigger as it goes along.  My main problem with it was, just as the events take on a massive global significance, the film turns to focus on only the farm house.  This is OK but I felt I needed to see more of what was going on elsewhere as the small scale action couldn't compete with the bigger picture.The film has plenty of jumps but suffers from being overly deliberate and plodding for the majority.  Every scene is shot as if it is teasing with the idea of an alien bursting out at every minute and thus doesn't feel like it flows or is as natural as it could be.  The actual plot is OK but many will be turned off by it's concept that `God has a plan'  especially since they came for sci-fi, not religion.  The flashbacks don't totally work and Shyamalan's traditional twist is not as impacting as he probably planned it to be.The cast is pretty weak considering the talent.  Gibson plays it too tight and reverently all the way, it's hard to get with his character considering how straight he plays it.  Then on the other side of the coin Phoenix is better because he is a little looser and more comic, but this doesn't sit well with the `on edge' feel that Shyamalan has given almost all of his scenes.  Culkin is OK but too obvious while Breslin is better than she is allowed to be and really could have benefited with a bit more screen time.Overall this is a good story at heart but is spoilt a little by the telling and the fact that, while we all saw it becoming a global sci-fi, Shyamalan was actually building it to be come a much smaller look at faith and God. This clash of aims is hard to accept but there is still plenty to enjoy as well as plenty of jumps, just a shame that the film's final quarter can't live up to the expectation the plot had created.",Null,50,103,1 September 2003
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," An excellent Woody Allen film that comes from a smart and sexy script, delivered with beautiful filming and strong performances from all
","I watched this film a few days after I had seen Allen's previous effort, Cassandra's Dream, and I must admit that I was going through a bit of a spell with him because, over the last decade I have almost had to defend his films that I have liked, while also acknowledging the man that are average or worse. However, like Spike Lee, I rarely find a film of his that isn't worth seeing  whether it is any good or not being another question. Vicky Cristina Barcelona was out in the US and the fact that I had access to a Woody Allen film suggested that it was better than some of his more recent work (a lot of which I never got the chance to see in any cinema) but I was also wary because this film was well-known for one specific thing and I figured that perhaps it was being helped by that, with the studio hoping the 'A Woody Allen film' tag wouldn't put the teenage male crowd off paying to see what they came for!I needn't have worried because it is like the man behind Cassandra's Dream and this film cannot be the same person. It is a excellent film and one that Allen's fans will love and perhaps, just perhaps, it may even be good enough to win over those that wouldn't give him the time of day far less the price of a cinema ticket. It helps that the film is firmly back on themes that Allen has done so well in the past  matters of the heart, of passion, of love, of lust, of marriage. The whole film plays in its entirety just like one of the many 'discussion' scenes where the characters discuss these matters over coffee etc and it is this consistency that makes it such a joy because what we see minute to minute engages and that is pretty much what we get from the film as a whole  but not as a sum of the parts but as the whole producing the same as the parts but in a different way. This interests me and it is delivered with a colour and flamboyance that somehow never takes away from the intelligence and thoughtfulness behind the writing; I'm not sure how he did it because the narrative is so wild that it could easily have been silly, but he holds it together without it even looking difficult.The use of a narrator concerned me at first  particularly since I had just seen Allen S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G everything out in big dialogue chunks in Cassandra's Dream but on the contrary here the narrator is used to link and mostly compliments by being droll and being a great voice (good casting job there). The cast are what will attract an audience to this film and, beyond them just being some very big names, they are all excellent. Bardem is just so effortlessly sexual and sensual that he perfectly fits Allen's writing of this passionate, creative love versus the steady and frankly dull love of Messina's Doug. Hall essentially takes the traditional Allen role but makes it work more than others trying it have done. She doesn't take the mannerisms so much as getting the character right and she is the heart of the film, thrown between passionate love and reliable love. No question which Cruz represents and she does it really, really well. Out of sight for the majority of the film she strikes like a thunder storm, totally wild and full of fire  but not to the point where she is unattractive or not tempting, which would have taken away from what she was trying to be. Johansson is easily the least of these talented names but even she does well; I won't say brilliant but she was good. Again, Welch was a good choice for narrator and I always enjoy Clarkson even if she has limited times to shine here.Allen's direction is really good in regards the actors but of equal note is how he and Spanish cinematographer Aguirresarobe have delivered Barcelona to the viewer. The city contributed towards the making of the film and on the evidence of this it will be money well spent. The city looks beautiful, with great landscapes, plenty of colour to match the passion and a real sense that this is a place where art, passion and inspired sex is all around. Beyond being just wallpaper, this is of course a key part of the film's world and it is another part of the reason that this hooked me so easily.Vicky Cristina Barcelona will likely be gushed over in the same way that any recent Woody Allen that isn't rubbish is hailed as a 'return to form' etc. On this occasion though, such praise is not a knee-jerk but fully deserved. The film is intelligent, passionate, comic, free-flowing and enjoyably light. It looks the part and the cast take the natural, smart script and make the absolute most of it. I guess if you dislike Woody Allen then none of this will matter but to those that even have a liking for his better work, this film will hit the spot. It has been a while since I have had the words 'excellent' and 'Woody Allen film' together in the same sentence, but this is an excellent Woody Allen film.",Null,49,94,26 December 2008
Sweet and Lowdown," Bittersweet comedy that is best when sweet but is difficult when bitter
","A mockumentary charting the last few years of the career and life of jazz guitarist Emmet Ray  considered one of the finest guitarists of the time, second only to Django Reinhardt.  The film charts his colourful rise from small time pimp and kleptomaniac to the recording of the work that experts claim to be some of the best of the period.Like the title suggests, this is a split film and that is the reason I think I may have had difficulty enjoying it with quite the same light laughter that I have had with Woody Allen over the past few years.  The plot is set up well with the fictional character treated for all the world as a real legend worthy of documentary treatment.  The use of talking heads frames the story well and almost allows it to be more piecemeal that it would have been able to as a straight film.  The `sweet' of the film (or rather `bittersweet') is the comedy of the tale  the lunacy or whimsy of the whole affair and this works well and sets the tone.What then sours the mix a little is the `low-down'.  Basically the story is around quite a selfish and unpleasant character and it is hard to get past that  especially where the comedy is so very light for stretches.  It is hard not to feel that the mood of the film is changing as Ray shamelessly hurts a naïve mute girl who seems to adore him  he seems to be happy to have found someone who can only listen to him talk about himself without interrupting.  There is, of course, redemption but this comes late and doesn't lift the fact that the lead is an unpleasant character, albeit one easily mocked for his own inadequacies.To his credit Penn holds the role together and doesn't et it become so unsympathetic that the film is lost  it is only occasionally when the actions of his character overwhelm his portrayal of the character.  Support is generally good, Morton is touchingly sweet despite the lack of dialogue, LaPaglia is a good a mobster as you'd expect, Thuman is a good part and there are some well known `Allen' faces in small parts.  The talking heads are good and not overly used for comic interludes  they play it straight and let the story make the funnies.  Allen brings his passion to jazz into his bits and it's difficult to see that he has his tongue in his cheek.Overall I must admit that I didn't connect with this film as well as other Allen fans seem to have, mostly because the bittersweet mix was enjoyable when leaning towards the sweet but it was less so when the bitter side (understandably) was brought out.",Null,4,6,31 May 2003
The Deer Hunter," Overlong and not as deep as it thinks but still a very good film
","Three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania prepare to go to war in Vietnam.  The night before they go, Steven is married, sparking a large celebration.  The next morning they go deer hunting one last time in the woods before they leave.  Time passes and the three meet up again in Vietnam as prisoners of war. Brutal mental torture affects them in different ways before they escape and are separated again.  Back in Pennsylvania Michael realises the extent to which the war has not only affected him but devastated the lives of his friends in different ways.I have seen this film several times and I'll admit that I always assume that it is a classic film mainly because I saw it twice when I was in my early teens and was blown away by parts of it.  I say this because I want to acknowledge that it may not be as great a film as many critics lists believe it to be, but at the same time I still watch it occasionally as I find it to be a moving story and a good film.  The plot is moving if it is viewed on it's surface as a tale of three men whose lives are deeply affected by the war.  Going past that to deeper themes I always feel that the film doesn't manage to be as deep as it thinks it is, so I try not to linger too long on these.The breakdown of the film gives significantly more time to events in the home town rather than Vietnam.  This is as it should be  for many people the war was a fleeting thing that has stayed with them for much longer than they were actually involved.  The wedding scene is a little overlong but it does serve as a chance to get to see the characters in their setting before we quickly move to the events that changed them and the people they become. The time in Vietnam is quite short but very memorable (many people who have never seen the film will still know these scenes) and the final hour or so of the film is moving even if it takes things to an extreme to make it's point.The cast make the film work as well, if not more, than the material itself. De Niro is the rock on which it all stands and is pretty good.  The only weakness in his performance was that he was the one who had to be `the hero' type who does what he can.  Walken gets the lion share of praise for his is the role that changes the most significantly throughout the film.  It is easy to forget that he was not anywhere near as famous as De Niro at this time and it is amazing in that regard to see him hold his own.  Savage gives a good performance and support is strong in the form of such actors as Cazale, Dzundza and Aspegren.  Even Streep gives a performance refreshingly free of sentiment or forced accents.The film is a little overlong and could easily have lost 30 minutes (although not all from one place) to give it a tighter feel.  Some scenes feel stretched beyond their useful duration leading to the feel that the film wanted to be 3 hours long, rather than being cut back to 3 hours long. Despite this though I still think this is a good film that is a powerful story at it's heart. I personally don't think it would make my top 50 (were I ever to do one) but I will watch it again.",Null,22,40,5 July 2003
Identity," The twist is cleverer than the genre should allow but needs you to be totally into the film to accept it - the cast and the direction are both quality in quite an exciting and enjoyable movie
","In the middle of a rainstorm, the judge and lawyers involved in the case of murderer Malcolm Rivers (due for execution the next morning) are called together to discuss evidence that the defence believe had been illegally suppressed.  Meanwhile a series of accidents, damaged phone lines and flooded roads means that a group of strangers are forced to hole up at a motel.  When the prisoner of a cop escapes and a murder occurs, they group together to try and capture him.  However with him dead the deaths continue - each with a room key forming a morbid countdown as the remainder try to survive the night.For the majority of this film (more or less the first hour) the film is a standard horror thriller that is quite thrilling as the guests are picked off one by one.  However more or less on the hour comes a twist regarding the connection between the guests that is at first silly, but then actually quite clever - even if it takes a bit of swallowing.  From then on it continues in the same vein, with this twist changing our perception of the action onscreen.  I imagine about as many of the audience will scoff at the twist as will accept it and like it.  I liked the twist and thought it was pretty clever even if I have to acknowledge that it is pretty touch and go for a minute or so at least.  The deaths are a mix of gory and shocking (without pushing it to an 18 certificate) and the first hour is pretty effective in terms of tension and drama.The director opens with several clever shots that freeze frame before moving onto the next scene - this is pretty slick and helps start the film with a good sense of urgency.  His direction within the motel is hardly original but again it works well enough.  The heavy rain serves to put walls around the motel (ie by not being able to see further than the perimeter) and this also increases the tension and the feeling of being trapped.  Of course it's not brilliant as it is really still just a slasher thriller but it is an effective one.  The cast go a long way to helping this by having quite a few big names as well as pretty good performances.  Cusack and Liotta are both good despite the temptation to slum it in this.  They both up the tension and the urgency by their performances.  Peet is the standout from the rest but McGinley, De Mornay and others all do well.  In the hearing Vince is as good as he always is when called upon to do a character with darting eyes and he is effective doing what he does (as little as that is here).Other than the big name actors, many people will wonder what about this film made it stand out so much that it got good critical reviews.  I think the critical twist will annoy as many people as it pleases and you do need to have been absorbed into the story by the hour mark to really appreciate it. I'm not a big fan of this genre but I enjoyed this movie and suspect that fans of this type of film will as well.",Null,84,102,18 April 2004
Saving Mr. Banks," Has its flaws but has quality in the design and delivery
","I'm not sure how much of this film is actually true and how much of it is creative license for the sake of a good film, but I'm not too bothered because I doubt too many people come to this thinking they are watching anything other than a piece of light entertainment albeit with a basis in reality. The film concerns the making of the film Mary Poppins – a film that Mrs Travers, the author of the source material is very protective of and that Walt Disney is keen to make and make in a way that he knows will work and sell. Throughout the mostly gently comedic film, we get flashbacks to Travers' youth in Australia with her challenging situations, a fun-loving father and a distinctive house- keeper.The film is delivered with a rather uneven tone but it is one that it mostly hangs together even if it never really becomes a great film. At its heart it is really sentimental, with a nostalgic and comedic air throughout; at the same time it seems to hint at elements which are factual, but the additions suggest a real push towards more of a warming and touching story. The flashbacks are part of this although the film never really has the depth that these suggest was being tried for. The film seems to be fine with this though and to be honest, so was I. I enjoyed it for its sentimentality and was grateful it didn't overdo it or push for tears or chuckles too heavily; it is a very nicely crafted film where you sort of feel the quality and, even though you can see what it is doing, you at least appreciate that it isn't doing it in a really cheap way.This can be seen in many aspects – from the look of the film, the sets, the design and the whole tone but also in the performances. Hanks is nicely engaging and takes to his role well but it is Thompson that really brings the most to the film. Her crispness adds to the comedic element of course, but it is her delivery that, by reflection, makes the flashbacks work better than they would otherwise have done in terms of the formative aspects of the narrative and characters. Support is good from Whitford, Novak and Schwartzman, although I thought the film didn't really need Giamatti's character adding to the sentiment. In the flashbacks Farrell and Wilson both do well, and it is nice to see Griffiths in her small role.Saving Mr. Banks is not a fantastic film but it is a gently entertaining and engaging one. It has its flaws for sure but it wears them well and has strengths that help cover them up; the end result is perhaps sentimental but it is not mawkish and I enjoyed it for its quality build and delivery.",Null,0,1,8 June 2014
Speed," Has weak moments but when they're on the bus it never falters for a second
","Cops Jack and Harry successfully defuse a hostage situation leaving only the bomber himself dead.  Later they are awarded but find the bomber is not so dead.  In fact he has wired a city bus to explode and wants $3 million in 3 hours.  He tips off Jack where the bomb is however once the bus goes over 50 mph the bomb arms, if it falls below 50 it then goes off.  Jack finds himself on the bus with a civilian driver and a load of passengers desperately avoiding obstacle to keep the bus moving while Harry tries to find the bomber.The big summer sleeper of it's year, the simple premise of this film meant it was easily the most talked about film  the cheapest marketing available! The film opens with a set piece around a lift-full of hostages.  This introduces us to the characters and sets up the motive for the next bit on the bus.  The bus is the majority of the film and when it gets going it is very good.  When the story has to explain things or develop character the camera goes static and you can feel the dullness set in (e.g. in the bar-room after the award ceremony).  However the action around the bus means that you never have time to draw breath  no matter how implausible it is.Director Jan De Bont cut his teeth on Die Hard and knows how to do a tight action movie  however his desire for more and more bangs lead to a 20 minute conclusion which is not only forced but feels like it was tacked onto the end of the bus movie.  It is stretched and just copies the action on the bus in an attempt to get the same effect  it doesn't succeed.  Instead the ending leaves a bit of a sour taste after such a great movie  the last 2 times I watched this on TV I just turned it off after the bus bit ended, the ending really is that much of a let down.Keanu Reeves makes the most of his role after Willis, Cruise, Tom Hanks, Depp and Stephen Baldwin all turned it down.  He does the tough guy thing really well and still manages to come across as a semi-real person. Likewise Sandra Bullock gets herself star status and number one slot on every `100 sexist' lists for months to come by getting the role of Annie after Halle (this moment is so much bigger than me) Berry turned the role down.  Bullock manages to be sexy and realistic  it's only at the end where she turns into your average women needing saving.  Daniels is good in support, as is Spin City's Alan Ruck and the always reliable Joe Morton. Dennis Hopper is a very good bad guy  it's not quite Blue Velvet quality but he's very believable.Overall the majority of this film is a real roller coaster that keeps the pressure up.  However with the 20 minute ending De Bont shows he doesn't know when to stop and ruins things by going too far with the train climax. Sadly this lack of restraint also caused him to make the terrible Speed 2.",Null,2,7,14 April 2002
Live Free or Die Hard," Great fun as a noisy summer blockbuster but perhaps too limited to stand the test of time outside of home court advantage
","Halfway through the summer of 2007 and I had still to see a blockbuster I really enjoyed. Fantastic Four 2, Ocean's 13, Shrek 3, Spiderman 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and others were OK at best and rubbish at worst and I had high hopes that Die Hard 4.0 (as it was called in the UK) would be the film that just remembered the fun and action that a solid summer blockbuster can deliver. Mostly, I'm happy to report, this is just what it delivers. Although it gets a bit bogged down as it moves forward, the narrative throws up loads of action and excitement, with noise and spectacle being the name of the game. Praising the film for being 'old school' perhaps ignores the amount of CGI that it uses but it is true to say that the action feels remarkably 'real' with stuntmen and real objects used to good effect.The delivery is mixed but the first half of the film has some great moments of action that gets the blend of action, comedy and tension just right  the highpoint for me being the build-up and execution of the traffic being sent into the tunnel (the lights going out being a great trigger). After this (particularly from the scene in the powerplant onwards) the action remains overblown but it tends to lose a certain amount of tension due to the overblown nature of the action and narrative. This was to be expected because we are not given the control surroundings of the first two films or the focused action of the third but it is still a little disappointing to be sitting back watching the scale of the action, rather than really being into it.For this reason I do feel that the film is unlikely to be viewed as kindly as it is being at present (time of release) and that the flaws across it will be exposed when it moved out of the summer period and into the homes of the audience. The narrative is one of the problems and I do agree with those that ask if this couldn't have been improved in the decade since the third film. The concept is good but it isn't really as smart as in other films where the robbery is a clever twist  here it doesn't quite work and really we are left with a chase movie. This is also why the first half of the film was more enjoyable for me, because McClane was the hunted  just like he was in the other films, albeit the hunted turning the tables. However in the second half he becomes the Terminator  an unstoppable pursuer. Yes, he hurts himself like McClane and spits blood, but it is hard to avoid the fact that he is the hunter and that he is essentially swatting aside anything that is put in his path to stop him. In this regard McClane becomes less relevant within his own film and I think it is understandable that some fans of the series are a bit let down by this.The move away from this part of the series is minor though and is minor compared to the more obvious shift which saw Fox chasing a bigger audience and sacrificing content for it. With a PG-13 we are treated to a swear-free experience that even sees the catchphrase essentially dropped. Swearing itself is not something I miss but when it is replaced by bad lip-synching then it is annoying and it does make the whole film feel cheap. Again I am totally with the fans who wonder why the series they love was cheapened in an attempt to be marketable for the kiddie audience. Gabriel is not a great villain  he is a bit too one-dimensional and he is more Colonel Sanders than he is Hans Gruber.Wiseman directs the action pretty well even if he loses it a little as the film goes on. The use of the score to link with the first film is always appreciated by me and the odd injoke was amusing even they were a bit clunky at times (we got the Agent Johnson bit  we didn't need it emphasised). Willis needed more material to work with because at times he does seem like he is asleep. I enjoyed his McClane performance with all that I expected from it, but he cannot find the urgency that he brought to the other films, perhaps because of his role as hunter. Long is a nice sidekick  he's no Jackson but he is enjoyable. Olyphant does his menacing stare well enough but offers little else. Q is a physical presence but she cannot bring much to the party beyond this. Winstead is an unwelcome addition to the film in my opinion. Her introduction makes for a slow start and her involvement in the action is unnecessary  McClane was already going after Gabriel, the additional motivation was not needed by him or by the audience, making her weak performance a distraction more than a bonus.I have been negative here but I am just trying to think beyond the summer. However not all of what I applies at this time because, in the context of a summer of overly serious threequels and misfiring superheroes, Die Hard delivered just what I was looking for  noisy, enjoyable action spectacle. Yes, I found it disappointing in some regards but for what it does, it is noisy summer fun that should be seen for what it is.",Null,9,16,12 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," Flawed but better than the usual no-brain summer blockbusters
","Following an assassination attempt on the President of the USA by a mutant, General William Stryker is ordered to take action against the mutants. Using information gleamed from Magneto, he attacks the X-mansion, taking some prisoners and scattering the rest.  Wolverine, just returned from the hunt for his past, escapes with Pryo, Iceman and Rogue and sets out to meet up with Storm and Jean.  As the full extent of Styker's plan becomes clear, the X-Men have no choice but to join forces with Magneto to defeat him.I have to be honest I say that every year I get sucked in by the hype machine that surrounds the summer blockbusters.  Most of the time I am let down (Jurrasic Park 3, Planet of the Apes  the list is long).  This summer looks different with this and the Matrix films to look forward to and X2 was the first one I came to.  I enjoyed the first film and immediately noticed that it's strength had been lost in this sequel.  Here the running time is over two hours and the central plot includes a lot more side issues than the first.  In one regard this is good because there is much to hold the interest.  However it also means that the film doesn't all work  most of it does but a lot of it feels abandoned or incomplete.  Wolverine no longer is the focus as he was in the first, and this is a loss.  His story is the most interesting to many people but he isn't allowed as much as he deserves. However he fares better than Rogue and Cyclops who barely have anything to do.The central plot is good and has enough twisting to keep you entertained  only the odd subplot appears to be on a hiding to nowhere.  The action scenes are good on the whole.  The opening assassination attempt is very exciting and the storming of the mansion is solid.  The climax of the film with Wolverine is a little disappointing thanks to MTV style editing making the fight unclear.  Although some people have complained about it being action light, I think that is missing the point.  The film is more about the plot and the characters than just the action.  So we do have lots of dramatic scenes without action but they still work as they are building a wider story.The film is a lot less funnier than the first and hence a little less enjoyable on a surface level.  Mostly this is due to the shift of focus off Wolverine and his lines.  There is still some humour but too much of it is ill-judged (in the middle of Iceman `coming out' to his family  an emotional point  his mother says `have you tried NOT being a mutant'  didn't work for me).  Happily the darker side of the film is stronger and makes this change of tone feel deliberate rather than a loss of humour. Singer directs well overall and uses his budget well  only the fight between Wolverine and Oyama was one part where I felt he had over stretched his reach a little.  He has nice touches as well  like including stuff for the harder core comic fans (eg Colossus at one point).  Also there are modern day parallels to be had in the script that are a little bit less than flag waving.The cast really help this film though.  Jackman may not be the central focus for this film but he is the centre of every scene he is in.  Stewart and McKellen both do very good work here and really contribute to the feeling that this is more than a dumb blockbuster.  Berry is OK but on at least one occasion her breasts seemed to be used to greater effect than her character. Janssen comes on a lot and her struggle with her changing powers is well portrayed.  Romijn-Stamos has a much bigger role and her character is used well.  Paquin and Marsden are AWOL even when onscreen but Cumming is a good addition.  Cox is the film's greatest addition and he doesn't allow Stryker to become a carton bad guy at any point. I really like Kelly Hu and was sad t see her have little to do.  In fairness she manages to make a good impression without more than a line in the whole film but her final fight is a little disappointing.Overall this is a superior summer blockbuster.  The way it tries to carry so many subplots and side characters causes it to become very weak and times and not all of it works very well but it is still good for what it is.  The change in tone from the first film will put some off but I enjoyed it and found the story to be well supported  however for X3 I hope that this ensemble feel is cut back a little and a smaller core of characters allowed to develop well rather than a lot of them developed a little.",Null,7,14,3 May 2003
The Ringer," More sensitive than I expected but as a genre film it is not funny or interesting enough
","Unable to fire a janitor, Steve Barker gives Stavi a job as gardener at his apartment complex. However when the man loses his fingers in an industrial accident Steve is faced with paying for the surgery. Coincidently Gary Barker is a gambler with large debts and no hope of getting himself out of trouble. Lacking any sort of moral scruples, Gary comes up with the idea of entering Steve into the Special Olympics and betting on him as a sure fire winner ahead of all the other 'retards'. A group of his fellow competitors spot him a mile off but when he explains what he is trying to do they agree to help him as long as he can beat cocky regular winner Jimmy.OK, so I sat down to this film knowing that basically this is a comedy about a man who pretends to have a mental disability to cheat at the Special Olympics, features the word 'tard' used loads in the first ten minutes and stars the man behind Jackass. So at no point was I expecting this to be sensitive or PC at all, but I figured it might provide some basic laughs and be worth a look. Surprisingly the film is not as insensitive as the opening ten or so minutes would suggest. This is not say that the film gets into the characters of the mentally challenged characters because it is not some deep film, but rather than it doesn't mock them for being what they are. What the film is is a sports genre comedy with basic characters  it just happens to be set in the world of Special Olympics.However, reviewing it as a genre movie I must admit that it is only an average one at best. It isn't very funny and the plot just moves along with no real inner logic or desire to do anything clever or interesting. The plot is nonsense, with the dumbest people in the world not spotting Steve's ruse. The romance subplot is clunky and drags the film down somewhat. The 'PC' issue is a little bit obvious as the film tries to walk the thin line between respectful and offensive but generally it doesn't let it be a big issue and simply lets it be. Knoxville is pretty poor as 'Jeffy' because he can't really act that well. He does a good job though of preventing Jeffy being a terrible stereotype and, although he's not great, he walks a difficult line well; I'm not sure if he is really going to be able to be a 'real' actor outside of this sort of thing but he was OK. Cox must have been paid lots and I hope he invested it well. Heigl is good looking but that's about it. The support cast are good and the material treats them well. Of course nobody is brilliant but within the context of the genre Rees, Barbanell, Howze, Arend and others are pretty good.I'm not sure who the film is aiming for though. Those coming to the film ready for non-PC laughs will be disappointed while those who would appreciate the fact that the film tries not to make a big deal out of disability will probably not have bothered to watch it anyway. Overall then an average genre movie that does what sports comedies do with the twist but not many laughs and not much plot to sustain it. Kudos for not being really insensitive but that alone does not make for a good film.",Null,1,2,18 December 2006
Thor: The Dark World," Solid blockbuster with good mix of effects and entertainment, although needed to play to its strengths more
","Years of disappointment and bad experiences have told me that most summer blockbusters are not the event movies that the advertisements would like you to believe; yes they are about the spectacle but with large TVs and strong sound systems being the norm now, it is not a big loss to enjoy such films in your home away from talking people, mobile phones, crowds and inflated prices. So it was with the Thor sequel. The original film had been pretty good but seemed cluttered with introductions and franchise stuff. The second film doesn't have so much of this and it mostly works pretty well although it must be said that it never seems to consistently play to its strengths.The plot does seem to link to Marvel lore that fans will appreciate but for the casual viewer it works well enough to do the job without knowing too much. Basically some dark power has escaped and Jane has been exposed to it making her a target for some dark elves who seek to destroy everything. Thor must not only protect her but also destroy the dark power before it can be harnessed by the elves – a task he can only perform with the help of Loki, currently rotting away in a cell. As a plot it sets up lots of confrontation and this is the main thing we are here for, so in that regard it works well enough. That said, it doesn't seem to be able to do enough of its better stuff.The better stuff tends to be the less serious material; Thor is a character and a story steeped in serious words and big Norse gods whereas Iron Man (for example) has a playboy at its centre, thus making the fun and swagger easier to come by. This film benefits from Loki being fun and playful as a villain and when he is around the film is better; there are a few other aspects where the playful fun comes in but mostly it is associated with Loki and there are frankly too few of these scenes. The fun adds to the entertainment value and while it does still work without it, it doesn't work quite as well.The special effects are good though and if you are looking for distracting noise and spectacle then this does the trick – perhaps not enough to hold your full attention but perfectly fine if you wish to switch off the brain to a certain extent. The cast act well considering they are mostly on a green screen. Hemsworth gets the balance right between playing a big god and also having a bit of fun, his only issue is sometimes the material doesn't let him do this. Portman is not so much of a presence although she does well enough and she has good chemistry with Hemsworth. Hiddleston gets the best material and has fun with it. Hopkins booms out his lines and Eccleston is a good (but unrecognizable) villain. Support is good from Alexander, Stevenson, Russo, Dennings, Skarsgård and others, while HBO fans will enjoy seeing two very strong characters from two shows represented by Akinnuoye- Agbaje (Oz) and Elba (The Wire).This isn't an amazing film but it is a solid blockbuster with good effects and plenty going on. I prefer it when it mixes some fun into the more faux-heavy dialogue and I'm not sure why it doesn't do this more often but it still works pretty well if you're in the mood for effects- driven action and spectacle.",Null,3,5,16 February 2014
Lucy," Has the gloss and nice structure, but ultimately lacking in forward motion, sense, and thrills
","It is to this film's benefit that it barely touches the 90 minute mark; not only was it this factor that made me watch it in the last 100 minutes of a long-haul flight, but it also means that it has a very short distance to go, and doesn't have to worry too much about not being able to keep up a fast pace all the way. This does cover up for a lot and to a certain point it did make the film work for me by virtue of it moving forward with slickness and material that offers some interest. It also benefits from a nice structure which has a lecture interspersed in the beginning, plus quickly edited clips and images, all of which add pace and variety.This approach is complimented by a slick presentation, a good sized budget, famous faces in the cast, good locations, and all the trimmings one expects with such films. Unfortunately, these aspects mostly serve to mask some of the inherent problems with it, rather than lift an already strong film to be stronger. The writing is probably the root of most things and in this case it is weak, trying to engage and expand but also trying to service an action thriller – it doesn't really do either well, even though in the broad sweep it is quite daring in where it goes. That said, by failing to really engage the brain, the daring place it ends up, actually comes over as pretty silly and ultimately makes for a weaker ending than it should have been.The action is a mixed bag since at times it is well executed whereas at others it is lacking in memorable set-pieces and tends towards genre cliché and standards. The slick style does cover this up, but generally the action doesn't thrill as much as it should, and combined with the so-so material, I did find myself just 'looking' at the screen, rather than really being into the film. The cast try hard and are part of the slick presentation; Johansson is not really used well, however she does her best in the style, and has some elements of performance about her. Freeman plays himself – and is best when detached from the action, not so much in the second half. Likewise Min-sik Choi is stylistically very much a key part of the film, but at the same time could have benefited from doing that within a better film.Lucy does fill its time well, and does it with a style and pace that at least will distract, but not much more than that. The action needed to be sharper, the ideas needed to be smarter, and although the destination is a good idea, it is poorly executed and ends up more silly than inspired.",Null,1,4,27 March 2015
Amélie," Wittily observed and quirky romance that's imaginative and sweet
","Amélie grows up a slightly introverted child as a result of her unusual parents.  When she grows up she has her own unusual habits and quirks. When she finds a hidden box of childhood toys in her house she decides to track down the owner and return it to him.  Seeing the happiness that she brings to him she resolves to work in secret to make other people happy.  However can she be happy herself?I wasn't sure what to expect with this film - I'd heard others raving on the boards about it but didn't even know the most basic of plot details about it, I didn't even know who the director was.  When the opening credits rolled and I saw that it was Jeunet as director I immediately realised that this may not be as straightforward as I had thought.  Almost immediately, the different humour comes through in lots of ways - from little things like the way the cameras moves up to the full script.  The plot doesn't totally work and some of the strands are a little unclear, but overall the film really works well as an alternative romance that is as sweet as it is quirky.The influence of Jeunet is the main reason the film works as well as it does.  He tones down his usual darker style and delivers something just as different and unusual but much lighter and refreshing.  As writer he does a great job coming up with imaginative characters and situations.  The other reason it works so well is through the performance of Tautou; she is such a wide eyed innocent - sweet without being sickly and likable without taking away from her quirkiness.  The support cast are all good and features a few Jeunet regulars but really it is Tautou's film and she carries it well thanks to the great work of the director.Overall this is a surprisingly sweet film that took me by surprise and was sweetly charming and lovely without falling into cliché - it was different and quirky in a refreshingly enjoyable way.  If you come to this expecting one of `the greatest films ever made' then you may be a little surprised because the film is quite unassuming and is best enjoyed when you come to it fresh.",Null,18,32,29 December 2003
The Sixth Sense," Clever ghost story
","Award winning child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is confronted and shot by an ex-patient.  Years later he has recovered from this experience and begins to treat a child who suffers from similar problems.  The young boy, Cole, claims to see dead people and requires Crowe's constant attention - to the detriment of his marriage.  With Cole becoming increasingly scared and withdrawn, Crowe is his last hope.This film is an old-fashioned ghost story, replacing gore with a genuine spooky atmosphere.  The story is deceptively simple and plays almost innocently for the whole film until Cole's visions are revealed.  The true genius of the story isn't revealed until the final twist when we see how we have been duped by a good director!  Even without the twist, this is still a good film - the story of Cole is well done and is chilling and frightening sometimes.  However it is also quite human, as it is essentially the story of Cole overcoming his fears.Willis delivers a careful, understated performance.  His choices in recent years have been remarkably good (with some exceptions).  This is just yet another great role from a man who's career looked like it was dying after 'striking distance' and 'colour of night'.  He hits just the right note here.  I'm not a big fan of child actors as a rule, but Osment is really good here - never falling into the 'cute child' category.  I don't know if he should have got the Oscar, but he's still good.  The rest of the cast are good, but really it's the central relationship between Willis and Osment that makes this film.The plot may have some holes in (some ghosts hang around where they died, one comes to find Cole etc), but overall this is very good.  The director weaves an interesting story that stands on its own, but makes it even more memorable by challenging how we accept and assume things in movies by delivering a great, clever twist at the end.",Null,5,7,15 February 2002
The Producers," Has some very funny and tasteless moments but is mostly just an amusing piece of ham
","With his business basically in the toilet after yet another flop, producer Max Bialystock has taken to extorting old women for small cheques. A visit by accountant Leo Bloom and an off hand remark about insurance puts a plan in Max's mind. With Leo he plans to gather a large amount of investment to produce a play that will be a sure fire flop and claim the insurance money when it closes on the first night; the only risk being that, if it makes money, then they will be in debt to all their investors and be charged with fraud. To make totally sure of a flop they decide on the most tasteless film they can possibly find, the worst director and the most unsuitable cast and, thou, the curtain is soon raising on 'Springtime for Hitler', a musical about the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany.With the play making headlines recently for big name starts dropping out of the London production (despite a great reception) I decided to rewatch the film again. As with my other viewings, I found the film to be consistently amusing with a handful of great moments but generally unworthy of the high regard that many seem to hold it in. The plot is a great concept and it produces the high point of the film with the wonderfully tasteless title song of the show, but too much of the humour is rather broad  and not in the way of Brooks' better spoofs but rather broad as in being generally amusing. The script lacks a real sharp edge to it and I didn't find myself laughing that many times even if I did find it to be consistently pretty enjoyable stuff.The cast are a big reason that it keeps this tone going, in particular the lead two, who ham it up for all they are worth in performances that suit the material even if it isn't their best work. Mostel plays it up well and a good chemistry with Wilder who overdoes it in a quieter way. Support is good from Mars, Shawn, Hewett and Hickey. As with the material, they are all very broad and enjoyable without ever really being great.Overall this is a funny film but not to the degree that some viewers may expect as a result of the high regard it is held in. All those involved have made better films and I found it to be rather broad as both comedy and satire and didn't excel as either. Despite this, the highs compensate for the odd moment where it falls flat and generally the film is a fun and enjoyable 90 minutes.",Null,2,6,4 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Overcomes its inherent challenges by producing a fast paced, dramatic, fun, and very enjoyable film that hits all its marks
","By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works.It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think – because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging.The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color – but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form – Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun.Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot – and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case.",Null,3,25,2 July 2016
RED," Gets the comic tone just right to make it an enjoyable action movie with its tongue in its cheek
","I first heard about this film when Bruce Willis appeared on the Daily Show. The clip they used was the one where Willis steps out of the spinning police car and is narrowly missed by it as he calmly opens fire on his assailant. On the face of it the clip looked ridiculously overblown and the special effects used weren't great either and it didn't look real (which didn't help with it looking daft either). On the strength of this I wasn't fussed about seeing another film where obvious special effects make the impossible appear possible while the audience are left with nothing but spectacle. Despite this I wound up seeing it this weekend and have to admit that the clip does work in context even if it doesn't as a standalone.The difference is that the film gets the tone just right and makes it easy to enjoy by having its tongue in its cheek for most of the time. This is essential in a film where we are expected to believe that retired agents over 50 years old can still beat all challengers and pull off ridiculous feats such as shooting a missile in mid-flight with a pinpoint shot. I'm sure some will not get this humour and therefore the film will not work but for me I found myself quickly charmed by the good-humoured nature of it and I found it very easy to enjoy as it delivered solid action with a knowing wink. Plot-wise it is just as silly but again this is carried along by the fact that it is enjoyable and quite fun.The script is a big part of it and it hands the cast some nice banter which is a big part of the film being fun. They respond to it well, even if more could have been made of the age thing. Willis is a necessary evil but one that works. His wise-cracking personae and his ability to wryly undermine himself while also doing action means that he is perfect for this sort of film but the downside is that part of the 'concept' is that the main characters are old and retired. Yes, Willis is old but at the same time we are used to seeing him be old and invincible in other films (where we are asked not to see this as an issue) so it is perhaps a jump to expect him to fit in as 'old' here. He does work well with Parker though, who herself is good value as she 'gets' what the film is doing. Malkovich is enjoyably manic while Mirren, Freeman and Borgnine are solid. I liked Urban's supporting turn.Overall Red is not a brilliant film, it is not something people will rave about for years to come. However what it does do it easily entertain. The action is solid but the comic tone is key and it gets this just right – never being dumb but never taking itself too seriously either. It is what it is and it is well done for the genre – a good Saturday night movie.",Null,2,5,18 November 2010
Flight," Makes a big impact early on but mostly wastes it and the potential in the cast (spoilers)
","When it came out everyone knew two things about Flight – it has a dramatic plane crash in it and it represented a shot at an Oscar for Washington. The timing was the usual end quarter 4/quarter 1 period where the big push films tend to come out and the trailer did a great job of showing us the plane crash in too much detail. I understand why it did because by far it is the best part of the film. We open with pointless nudity which seems to only be there so that we can be told that we are watching a 'grown-up' film. In retrospect it probably needs to do this because it is not as mature as it thinks it is.From here we get some establishing of characters before we have the incident on the plane. This scene is intense, dramatic and really well filmed; if you were not engaged by the film by this point, this sequence will do it. Sadly the remainder of the film fritters this all away and never makes the same impact again. Although not related to the cause of the crash, Whip has major problems with drink and drugs and this is what the majority of the film is about. I assumed that it would explore his character and his struggle but in reality we get one sequence of his self-destructive nature after another. All of them are well acted but none of them are reflective or do anything different from the one before or the one coming up next – indeed some of them are close to celebratory in how they are delivered and I'm not sure why humor was such a part of the film. Anyway, this is really all we get and to be fair the professional nature of it and the background of the crash does mean it is quite interesting, but it never does anything of merit outside of this.Instead of character and struggle exploration, we get a last-minute Road to Damascas and glib redemption. This feels cheap and only serves to highlight how little the film actually did with the character and the subject. The cast do what they can with it. Washington is great – shame he wasted so much on such an average film. Cheadle doesn't have too much to do but is a good presence – likewise Greenwood, Gerety, Tunie, Beauvais, Leo and the other familiar faces you'll see. The film really uses them as face though and not too much is done with them. Goodman feels totally out of place, like he has walked in from another film; I understand what his character was, but if the important thing is making his character convincing then they should make a film for that character – here what his delivery brought hurt the film – particularly when he is in the hotel room scene near the end, he adds a comedic element it didn't need. Velazquez (My Name is Earl) is used primarily for her nudity – it is totally unnecessary but I shan't pretend the film didn't get my whole attention from the very first shot because of it.Flight starts with many attention grabbing elements – in particular the crash sequence. From here it becomes an issues film but sadly it is one that is mostly badly done. We have ongoing scenes of behavior but nothing within them to run with. It should have been so much more and Washington clearly was up to the task, but it does nothing till an obvious denouncement. It isn't a bad film, it is just a disappointing one as it gradually deflates itself and wastes the potential it all.",Null,3,4,17 August 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Intense sequences ensure it goes out on a high even if I 'felt' less than in some of the other recent Potters (one very mild spoiler)
","I'm not a particularly big fan of this franchise if I'm honest, so for me when the final films came out I was more than happy to let the crowds come and go and I'd watch it at my leisure. It's not that I was apathetic but I've never bothered with the books beyond reading a few chapters of one to a child many moons ago and the film series took quite some time to really engage me. It did this as it got darker and, although the last film felt like it was stuck in a holding pattern, I did still enjoy it because it was very dark throughout. With this final film I had hoping that this brooding would continue but, being unfamiliar with the books, unlike many viewers I wasn't sure what was going to happen (despite Simon Mayo and Mark Kermode's consistent best efforts to give me spoilers).Understandably the brooding aspect of the last few films doesn't really make it far into this one because, although it keeps its dark tone and scary, the film is really all about the epic confrontation that the previous film had been leading up to. And it is pretty epic – the effects are tremendous and it really did engage me. This surprised me because previously a lot of the magic-driven action hadn't really done much for me and, although all the lights and effects had been pretty, they had sort of kept what was happening in a fantasy realm in regards my feelings. Here though the action had real impact and a real sense of violence to it and as sheer spectacle, it did work.In terms of the plotting and feeling, I have to say that the sheer scale of the set pieces really made me struggle to find something to feel about in the story. I was quite excited by the final battle but I didn't really feel invested it in, it was only occasionally intimate enough to make me care. As a result the 'nineteen years later' conclusion didn't do anything for me other than make me wonder if they couldn't have at least spared some of their special effects budget to convincingly age the three stars. I'm pretty sure that fans and particularly those fans that grew up with the franchise will be much more impacted by the conclusion and this flash-forward, but for me the film almost did the epic spectacle too well, because it hadn't left me too much room for emotional focus on the three children at the heart of the tale (and, ignoring their multimillion nest-eggs, these characters are children in terms of age).Their performances are not to blame because Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have all grown into fine actors and kudos to whoever manage to see that potential all those years ago. They (and their children) may never need to work again but they do good work here and it was their performances that stopped me totally losing sight of their characters in the middle of the special effects. Of course the quality of the rest of the cast (featuring every living British actor) is deep and even though none have much to work with they are good – credit to Fiennes that he manages to be a presence despite this really not being a project that ever interested him or engaged him as much as it did others involved.This final film is a fine spectacle though and it brings about a suitably intense finale to this (mostly) dark series. In my opinion the characters get a little bit lost in this specific film but it is understandable and those that already have lived formative years at the same pace as Harry et al, will not need this film to do anything to keep them involved – and given this is film 8, there probably aren't too many 'casual' viewers left.",Null,0,1,7 December 2011
Final Destination," Enjoyable and tense horror/thriller
","Waiting for the plane to take off for his high school trip to France, Alex has a vision of the plane exploding.  He panics and is removed from the plane along with several of his party.  As they argue in the terminal the plane explodes leaving them as the sole survivors and the FBI investigating how they knew.  When one of the number, Todd is killed, Alex realises that they have not cheated death and that the reaper is returning for them in turn.When I originally saw this film I was not that taken with it, however seeing the sequel made me realise just how superior to that, the original was.  The plot, taken from an X-Files idea is quite clever and originally worked out throughout the film.  Each death (or potential death) is shocking or tense or exciting, there is little of the obscene cruelty that exists within the sequel.  Here the characters are just a little more than meat to be sliced and diced in fancy manners.The cast are reasonably good.  Many are simply student clichés who have their time counted down.  Not knowing who was famous and who wasn't here I didn't know who would live and who would die and it made it quite exciting. Sawa leads the cast well and is a good character  his madness in the cabin is worth seeing.  Todd (Candyman himself) makes a brief cameo that helps the film and is nicely creepy and trashy at the same time.Overall this is an enjoyable trashy film that has gore and suspense and is enjoyable to watch.  The sequel was simply excessive death scenes and you'd do well to enjoy this film and ignore it's follow up.",Null,4,7,17 November 2003
Rear Window," Classy, gentle excitement with nice subtexts within the enjoyably tense main story
","Jeff Jeffries is an adventure photographer for a major newspaper who, thanks to an attempt to get an action shot during a motor race, has found himself in a plaster cast spending his days and nights in a wheelchair. His only visitors are his carer Stella and his beautiful, but pressurising girlfriend Lisa and the majority of his time is spend staring out the window into the courtyard area of his apartment complex. It is during one typically hot night that he spots something funny going on inside one of the apartments opposite his  the woman of the house seems to be gone and the man is acting suspiciously; from the confines of his chair, Jeff keeps watch, with the case becoming increasingly clear to him and his friends.Despite having themes in common with many Hitchcock films, this stands out as being one of a couple of his movies that are accessible and entertaining to a wider audience. Using voyeurism as its central theme, the film takes us into a fairly straightforward mystery that is well told but also laced with subtexts and other windows to stare through. To me this makes it a better film because there is much that intrigued me about the characters and the neighbourhood while also providing me with an engaging mystery. Modern audiences who have seen this film copied and referenced countless times will doubtless struggle to see what the fuss is about and perhaps they are right as the story doesn't have the twists and turns that are considered the norm now in a lot of thrillers; but it is still strong enough to keep the interest. The voyeuristic nature of the characters is interesting  with them changing throughout the film; meanwhile the many lives on display in the other flats provide other things to be interested in as well.Of course a massive part of it working is the cast. Stewart plays his usual 'aw-shucks' personae to good effect but crosses it with a certain lack of ethnics and a less than wholesome character who spends his nights with a young girl who he doesn't want to commit to and an unhealthy habit of staring at his neighbours. Kelly is sexually innocent and seductive with it  unlike Hitchcock I tend to find blonde princesses all a bit dull and obvious but she worked here. Stealing most of her scenes is sterling support from Thelma Ritter, not that different a performance from some of her others but still very well timed and blessed with some really great lines. Burr is rather stiff but at a distance it doesn't really matter and he does well enough. The various other neighbours each works well with their mini-stories that barely exist within the film but do add to the layered effect of the film.Overall the film is classy and the rich colours and ordinary setting are nicely in contrast with the action of all the main characters. The mystery is well delivered and engages in a gently dramatic fashion while the starry cast are impressive and interesting throughout. For my money not as pound-for-pound entertaining as North by Northwest but still one of Hitchcock's more widely accessible films if not quite one of his best.",Null,6,10,28 March 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," My objective and unhyped view? Stunning. Simply stunning.
","Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum.  Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.",Null,367,499,25 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Dated and very genre but still an effective low budget horror
","When a group of friends all have similar dreams with a weird man in a dirty red and black jumper they just think it's a bit weird. However when one of them is brutally murdered by an unseen force while she sleeps, her boyfriend Rod is arrested for the murder. Meanwhile, Nancy falls asleep in class, only to find herself chased through her dream by the same disfigured man. When it becomes apparent that this is more than a dream, more of Tina's friends start to dieWith seven or eight (who can keep track?) sequels under its belt, Freddy merchandising and the fact that the 'monster' has become almost a hero, it is hard to look back at this film with fresh eyes. This film is not the gory spectacle that teenagers with video recorders in their bedroom will have come familiar with over several flashy sequels; rather this is a low budget horror movie that is quite gory, quite scary and pretty effective. The plot is interesting enough and is better than the 'gore for gore's sake' that the sequels fell into  it's still not the most intelligent thing you'll ever see but it is still interesting enough. Of course it is about 20 years old now and it looks dated, an effect not helped by the way recent horrors have made fun of the things in here that have become genre cliché over the years. The downside of watching it now is that you expect it to be as 'big', 'gory' etc as the 7 or 8 sequels have progressively become  but it isn't, it's a lot more straightforward a horror than that.Despite this though it is still a good horror movie  low budget but yet with effective effects and a monster that has grown larger than the series itself. The cast all fit into the requirements of low budget horror, that is to say they can't really act and just scream lots. Langenkamp is a good example and, accordingly, she has done little since this film of any high caliber. Wyss, Garcia and even Depp are all pretty wooden and just fit in with the genre. Saxon puts in a better performance but even then it is only comparable. Englund is actually in the film a lot less than you would expect and, as a result, makes more of an impact. He would later take his Freddy to the level of cartoon character or celebrity (as shown in the New Nightmare) but here he gets his horror character just right  a monster.Overall this is a good low budget horror but it is one that is difficult to view now without looking back and seeing it as the start of a long horror series that producing a character that has even moved beyond the constraints of his own film. The best way to enjoy this is on its own terms  it is not a massive horror series, it is a single low budget horror movie from the mid-eighties; as such it suffers from the usual genre flaws from the period but it also delivers the goods in terms of scares and gore. It may not be as gory or as knowing as some of the later sequels but it does what it originally intended to do  scare and thrill.",Null,52,94,19 July 2004
The Truman Show," An unassuming film that is thought provoking on so many levels, well acted and thoroughly enjoyable however you come to it
","Truman Burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of Seahaven Island where nothing really happens. Everything is clean, everything is perfect, he knows people but never really connects to anyone. The one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go. Paralysed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident, Truman still feels he is missing something. A strange light falling from the sky, a man who reminds him of his dead father, a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrong  but what is it that he seeks but feels he cannot find?When I first saw this film it was with my girlfriend (who would then become my wife, then ex-wife!) and I remember how she and our friends felt a little bit cheated by the film that they had expected to be yet another wacky Jim Carrey comedy. In fairness to her and the others, it was easy to do this at the time  who would have thought that Jim Carrey would be able to act  certainly not the marketing department that sold this film on the basis of it being a hilarious film as opposed to the thoughtful and rewarding film it turned out to be. The plot can be viewed on so many levels that it is honestly easier to leave it to each viewer to take what they will from it. On the most obvious level it satirises the media, the emotional façade of television and (the increasingly relevant) look at reality shows. To others it will say as much about God, the empty drone of life and the things that we all desire. Of course to others it will just be a comedy with general comments to make  and there is nothing wrong with that whatsoever; in fact the multi-level approach works to make it appeal to many audiences.Starting as a comedy, I am always taken by how well the film moves to become more and more interesting but yet never loses sight of those audience members who have come for the basic story. Hence it delivers an enjoyable and engaging central narrative that, plainly put, makes for a comic and involving yarn  we grow to care for Truman and this makes the ending an emotional and satisfying one even if some viewers will bemoan the fact that (to them) it appears 'open ended'. That it is also a very thought-provoking affair is only a bonus, with the satire working on many levels. Of course by seeming to tackle so many subjects and issues in such a short running time, the film never really gets its teeth deep into any one of them but this is not a major problem because it leaves us to do that in our heads after the film finishes.The cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles. Of course it is easy now to look back at Carrey and accept that he can act straight but at the time it seemed so unlikely and few felt it was a good casting choice. Of course, seeing the end result it is clear that he can and he delivers such a great performance that he really makes the film work.He is comic but yet serious, sympathetic but not worthy of pity  it is a great delivery and one that basically meant that I now look at his Ace Ventura stuff as the 'other' category and see his acting as his real work (6 years ago that was vice versa). Carrey carries the film, being on screen for almost the entire film but he has good support from Linney, Emmerich, Krause and others who play it well despite being stuck in the necessary stiff and unreal roles. The controller etc roles are all well played and feature a collection of well known faces including a great support role from Harris through to roles for Giamatti, Shearer, Baker Hall and a few others. It may be Carrey's show but the support certainly helps.Overall this is a great film that can be appreciated as much for what it is on the surface (a great little comic story) as it can for the issues that it hints at all the time. There was a time when some viewers may have looked to a Carrey film to be a load of mugging an crude, basic laughs but this was the film that saw that change. Thought provoking, funny, entertaining, short, enjoyable and well acted throughout  well worth seeing and well worth coming back to several times.",Null,365,398,29 October 2004
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Solid step up from the first film even though it still lacks real teeth
","When I watched the first Hunger Games film I was surprised by how safe, sanitized and almost totally unmemorable it was – things that were even more surprising to me when you consider the subject matter of children murdering children. To me that was a failing of the film but also of the first part of the story since we really did need more horror and oppression to it all. As a result I really wasn't too bothered about seeing the next film but eventually I did simply because I had time to kill.Fortunately the second film steps things up pretty well because in the first hour I felt it did a much better job showing the impact of the killing and the violent oppression of the state than it did the first time. This is important because it did draw me into the situation rather than letting me sit passively. When the games section comes it does keep it relatively tight in the training section so it doesn't feel too retread. The games themselves focus less on the 1v1 aspect and more on the build to something else; this is fine for me since the film still lacks the nerve to be horrific in this way but here does at least provide some good action as it goes. The production values have also been increased and the laughable effects of the first film have been replaced by ones much more becoming of a film that wants to be a large blockbuster franchise.The entertainment value of the film is higher as a result but I did enjoy that it had found more of a consistent dark edge, even if it did still lack real bite in some ways. The performances were mostly strong too. With Lawrence in particular being very good at making the most of whatever she is given – which at times is not a huge amount it must be said. Hutcherson is the polar opposite of this and I have no idea how someone so bland managed to get such a role as this. Support is good from Harrelson, Sutherland, Banks, Tucci, Hoffman, Wright and others, giving the film a good spread of class even if they do not really get much time to do much.It is still flawed but at least this film seemed like it knew what it wanted to do and it found a darker edge it felt comfortable with even if it never really pushes the audience out of that nice marketable comfort zone that it has. I'm not only hoping the next film can continue this improvement but I'm looking forward to finding out.",Null,2,12,24 May 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Silly but just manages to get by with energy and charm
","Bill and Ted are slacker, surfer types in danger of failing history.  This would result in Ted being sent to military school  hence splitting their band, Wylde Stallions.  When all seems lost Rufus, from the future, arrives in a time machine to offer the dopey duo the chance to travel back in history and get first hand knowledge of the subject  the future society is based on the music of Wylde Stallions and Rufus must ensure they don't split up.  Bill and Ted set off on an excellent adventure.A famous film despite the criticism.  The story is little more than a series of sketches where Bill and Ted kidnap famous people from history.  This is quite amusing, but not hilarious.  It only really gets funny when all the historical figures are set loose in modern day America for 20 minutes. However even this is broad farce rather than sharp humour.  The characters of Bill and Ted are either annoying or cool  depending on how you feel about the surfer-speak they engage in.Reeves is cool and dopey  it's weird seeing this now, now that he's a big action hero (The One, no less!) but here he is at his rawest (although he's not a great actor).  The smarter of the two is also the one that has had less success commercially, but Winter also manages to carry off his role easily.  The rest of the cast are amusing in their one-dimensional historical roles.Overall it's silly and not very funny.  However it does have a sort of gormless charm and is quite enjoyable  like a snack that is tasty for a second but leaves no taste!  The best thing about this film is that it gave us a much better sequel!",Null,3,6,29 March 2002
The Matrix," Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)
","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day.  When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police.  However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy.  Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods.  Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.Has anyone not seen this?  The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero.  That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones.  The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing.  The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake.  Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.The action is fantastic.  After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here.  Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels.  The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT.  The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too).  Reeves is cool and is suited to the role.  Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on?  Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on.  Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden.  Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc.  How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted.  The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree.  However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch.  For me  I can't wait for the sequels.",Null,10,20,20 June 2002
Godzilla," Although effects and sound are technically impressive, it is quite unsatisfying and superficial
","I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.The film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others – all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on – a device that has impact for sure, but doesn't seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.On this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience – so it does it, lots. Considering I didn't care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed – it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness – something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.Unfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value.",Null,79,132,5 October 2014
Looper," Has its moments but mostly it is ideas without cohesion, flow or spark
","Looper was compared (by some, but not many) to The Matrix and Inception in terms of it being a smart film supposedly based on ideas and, to a point I suppose it is. The plot sees hit men recruited in the near future to kill and dispose of people the mob want out of the way; the twist being that these hit men exist many years before the hits need doing and the mob are sending the victims back to be killed and disposed of because in their future getting rid of bodies is apparently very difficult. These hit men are very well paid but, at some point they will do a final contract – their futures selves – at which point they are well paid off and allowed to life out the rest of their lives until the point where they become that person who is sent back to be killed. When Joe is sent back to be killed by himself though, he has other plans, sparking a race to change the future and the present.It sounds like it could have been a smart film but unfortunately the delivery from concept to filming is lacking. In terms of the ideas it is important not to think too hard about them or else the wheels will immediately fall off – even the idea that mob would have a time machine but not be using it for many other better ideas is one, but there are many others. The story unfolds with messy coincidence and a real lack of cohesion with many ideas and tones banging up against each other in a way that doesn't work – the film never seems to settle into a rhythm or flow and it is quite hard to watch as it is so uneven. I was surprised by how little spark there was to it as well – the filming style seems to be deliberately slow and moody, but the material doesn't support this approach, meaning that the unintended consequence is that the story seems lethargic and quite dull. It still has its moments but mostly it bored me.The characters and actors don't help. I understand why they wanted Gordon-Levitt to look as much like Willis as possible, but, as impressive as the transformation is, it is endlessly distracting – and considering how much more disbelief I was being asked to suspend by the rest of the film, I don't think it would have been a massive stretch to accept him as he is. The transformation into Willis also hurts Gordon-Levitt's performance as it is so much impersonation that he loses the character; it is excellent in terms of impersonation of mannerisms, tone and the like but there is no character here. Willis doesn't present one either and is so-so. Blunt is more interesting and at least has more to do than Perabo, although the latter will be more memorable to some viewers.Looper has some good ideas in here but they are presented without much cohesion, flow or spark. The tone of the film is all over the place and it never really got me engaged as it should have done and the manner of the ending suggests they had that as their first idea and sort of pieced it backwards from there. It is a very average film at best.",Null,2,4,6 January 2013
Casino," Scorsese tries to do a Goodfellas 2 but forgets to give substance to his style
","The rise (and fall) of casino boss Ace Rothstein in 1970's Las Vegas.  The film charts Ace's struggle in love with money hungry Ginger McKenna and his struggles to control his business with the violent influence of partner and friend Nicky Santoro.This is very much a rerun of Goodfellas - the running time, the heavy style of Scorsese, the cast, the soundtrack, the violence.  However here the story is so thin that it is really stretched to breaking point.  The first half is mainly just action, heavily stylised scenes with De Niro's voice over giving it a vague direction.  The plot kicks in in the second half with Rothstein's empire crumbling in parallel with his relationship with Ginger.  The action is pretty good, but the lack of narrative is a big problem.In Goodfellas, Scorsese's tricks seemed to be the icing on a very, very good cake.  Here they seem to be a end onto themselves.  Similarly Pesci's performance is very much a turned up version of his Tommy.  Scorsese's tricks, tracking shots and soundtrack all seem to be wasted here - as if he was looking for an excuse to do his visual stuff without needing a strong story.Overall this is an unfortunate version of Goodfellas.  Visually it is great but without a strong story it feels very empty and shallow - After Raging Bull and Goodfellas I didn't think Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci could do a bad movie.  Unfortunately here it is.",Null,6,17,30 January 2002
Heat," A great cop thriller with a rich tapestry of characters and subplots topped with two fantastic actors brought together for the first time
","Neil McCauley is a professional crook; he and his crew do very planned and detailed jobs and execute them without error.  Vincent Hanna is a cop who's life revolves around catching criminals with robbery homicide division. One botched job brings these two men into direct confrontation, sparking a cat and mouse game where McCauley's crew wants one last job, regardless of the heat that is being put on them by Hanna.The fact that this film brings with it one of the most anticipated onscreen pairings in recent memory is only the icing on a cake that stands out as one of the best cop thrillers of the 1990's.  Essentially a remake of the much lesser LA Takedown, Mann delivers a story that is a simple tale of two men on the opposite sides of the law who clash heads over one job - each using the skills they have in their field in an attempt to do what they have to do, but only one can succeed.  However this is layered with such great characters that it is difficult not to be impressed - many films would benefit from even half the characters and subplots that this has.If they hadn't worked, then these subplots and side characters would have felt unnecessary and really dragged the film down.  It is to the script's credit that this doesn't happen here and what they actually do is strength and enrich the central narrative and easily fills out the running time. The direction is great - visually the film is impressive and it really uses the streets of LA to good effect; I was really taken by how Mann was able to not only manage that side of things but to also to deliver on the characters as well.  It is not without problems though - and some of the subplots are running for some time before we find out what the point of the character is (most notably in Breedan's cook).  Also some of the threads seem unnecessary and distract - the fact that McCauley's betrayer is also a rapist is a side issue, while Lauren's problems are not dealt with that well.The plot is a solid crime thriller but it is the characters that make it so much better - in particular those of Hanna and McCauley, both of whom are well developed to the point that the audience never sides for one over the other.  The John Woo thread where the two men have admiration for one another is well done but not overdone.Of course a massive boost to the delivery of this dynamic is the pairing of two actors who, regardless of bad spells, are rightly revered as two of the finest of their generation.  Both are on great form here and it is as good a showcase for them as any other film.  It is impossible to say who is better because both are excellent - hell, even Pacino's OTT woo-ha'ing works here! Both bring so much to their performances, using minor facial expressions to convey so much - just look at De Niro as he drives through the tunnel at the end, we don't need to be told his inner thoughts because De Niro lets us see them.  The plot holds back their first meeting and it is worth waiting for - it doesn't overdo it and it proves that less is more.  They both underplay in a scene that lacks fireworks but is immensely satisfying.On top of this the support cast are roundly excellent with the material to work with in most cases.  Kilmer is not great normally but is excellent here, as is Sizemore and a nice role for John Voight.  It may be strange to see Haysbert now that he is famous for 24, but he is good here - even if the relevance of his subplot is less than clear until later.  Fitchtner, Williamson, Levine and Noonan are all good but, if the film has a weak link, then it is in the female characters.  The female cast are good on paper but they aren't given their fair share of the material.  Judd stands out because she is given a decent character but Portman, Venora and the beautiful Brenneman are only really required to fit in the best they can.  In fairness this is a minor compliant as such a rich tapestry was always going to have flaws - especially in such a masculine film.So, yes, this film has the odd weakness - the female roles aren't as strong as the male ones, and some of the subplots require a bit of faith that they will come through, but mostly the film hangs together as one that works superficially, on a basic plot level but also deeper with great characters who have their own lives and are not simply there to say their lines and fill in the background.",Null,8,13,13 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Classic bit of fun sci-fi  a space western!
","The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices.  The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems.  The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire.  However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star.  Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape.  When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi.  Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation.  However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space.  The story is simple but contains clear characters.  The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front.  The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle.  The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars!  The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer.  Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!).  He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role.  However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas.  Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances.  Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role.  Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'.  But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood.  Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.",Null,16,26,30 June 2002
Deadpool," Not quite as fun as it wants to be, but still fun
","There was a lot of clever marketing around this film – marketing which not only got the sense of humor of the film, but used it really well to get to, and expand upon, the target audience. Like the film itself, it was all done with such irreverence and lack of respect for the genre, that I found it quite refreshing – particularly as superhero films continue to puff themselves into bigger and more serious epic franchises. Mostly, the film itself manages to deliver in the same vein, but it is not as consistent as I would have wanted – and I can understand those that hate it.For all its subversive humor, the plot of the film is a collection of familiar tropes – the kidnap, the revenge, the origin story etc. An added downside is that this flaw doesn't really matter, because the plot always feels like it is an afterthought that the writers added once they had all the jokes and scenes they wanted down on paper. These are pretty funny, and the irreverent tone helps it work, but if you are not in the right frame of mind then it will probably grate quite a lot. The action set-pieces are pretty enjoyable though, and it does play well as a faux-subversive entry in the genre.It is fun, rude, and gory; and it is enjoyable for it. It does have its weaknesses though, and in the end it is not as clever or different as it thinks it is.",Null,0,5,2 July 2016
Thirteen Days," Very good at what it sets out to do and well worth seeing
","October 1962. An American spy plane picks up signs of nuclear missiles inside Cuba with the ability to strike the US. With the missiles not yet able to be used, President Kennedy and his staff are forced to decide a course of action against the Russians, all the time with the knowledge that being too weak or too strong in their actions could tip the standoff into catastrophe. As the decision is taken to use the US Navy to blockade Cuba all movement is read as messages between the two nations and the world holds its breath as the crisis deepens.Drawn from The Kennedy Tapes, this film looks back at the two-week Cuban Missile Crisis from the perspective of those involved in the White House. Some viewers have bemoaned this and claimed that it is nothing more than a one-sided love story to the Kennedy's and ignores the views of others outside of the administration. While there is an element of truth in this opinion, the film didn't really go that far for me and rather the enclosed view acts to increase the tension within the story. By experiencing it only from one sided it is possible to forget that you know the outcome as you get caught up in the blind judgements and the high-stakes game being played. Very few viewers (if any) will be unaware of the eventual outcome but it is to the film's credit that it still grips throughout.True, the film does rather worship the Kennedy brothers and there is nary a bad thing about them here but I forgave it of this because it was not really a character study so much as a summary of an intense political period in recent history. With this in mind the weakest parts of the film are moments away from the crisis itself; specifically I referring to the scenes involving O'Donnell's family  mostly they are unnecessary and stick out like a sore thumb. Costner plays his part well and leads the film with strength even if his character isn't the main one. Greenwood is good as Kennedy even if the material does push him to playing JFK like he was the messiah. Culp is almost as good and the three men work well together  although again there are perhaps a couple too many scenes of them being 'close' and they weren't all needed. Support is strong across the rest of the cast, with key roles in the story picked up by Baker, Fairman, Smitrovich, Mason and others.Overall then an engaging and enjoyable real-life thriller. Although it focuses on the US side of things, it is better for it as it is tense and convincing in how it depicts the pressure on those involved. Not as factual as a detailed documentary or as character-driven as a film looking at JFK in detail but very good at what it sets out to do and well worth seeing.",Null,3,4,4 January 2007
300," Visceral, violent and visually stunning to the point where the lack of much else doesn't really matter
","In the year 480 BC, King Xerxes of Persia set in motion his enormous slave empire to crush the small group of independent Greek states  the only stronghold of freedom still remaining in the then known world. As the countless armies of Xerxes approaches, King Leonidas petitions the ruling council to meet the army with whatever men can be found. With the council unwilling to release soldiers until after the religious festival, Leonidas sets out with his 300 strong personal army to meet Xerxes' men at a narrow pass knowing they must hold off the approach for as long as they can until the army arrives even if it means their deaths.Although I am surprised to see this film so highly rated on IMDb, I can understand why it is so because it does deliver a powerful experience, almost powerful enough to carry it through its lack of real depth or substance. You can see the selling point on the DVD cover or the poster because it is in these places where any film visually has to sell itself. With 300 though this selling continues across the entire film because, holding close to the graphic novel roots, the visual design is the all here. The plot is simple and, although there is a little bit of politicing back home, the film is all about the stand of the 300 against countless others. In this regard it is visceral, violent and visually stunning. The mix of effects with live action brings the action to live and is as suitably overblown as the legend.Snyder's direction matches the effects and he wallows in every macho swing of the sword, doing really well to capture the action in a way that is engaging and clear. The lack of substance was a bit of a problem but to be honest the film does sweep you along in the moment of the battle and mostly this is all you care about. The cast don't really have characters so much as presence and mostly they deliver in this area. Butler is strong in the lead and he convinces in the role of Leonidas. Headley and West have the harder job back home to provide some interest in the politics behind the battle  they do well enough (particularly The Wire's West, but I'm biased) but the script does rather leave them to their own devices. The rest of the cast are appropriately muscular and heroic and fit in with what the script is trying to do.Overall this is an effective but superficial film. The design and the look is the all but fortunately it delivers in this regard really well. The performances, the script and everything else falls into line in supporting the graphic novel feel of the film and, although I would like to say I favour substance over style, it is hard not to like when the style is this well done.",Null,40,64,18 November 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Has interesting and intense elements, but the tonal control is surprisingly weak and generally it is a messy affair throughout (MAJOR SPOILERS)
","I had only vaguely heard things about this film when I sat to watch it and, being honest, I was of the mind that it was more aimed at younger audiences. My basis for this was that it seemed like a spy spoof with gentle humor from the brief clip I had seen. Of course very early in the film the action and language let me know this is not the case at all. From this point on we have the standard structure of the new recruit providing the narrative and also acting as the viewer's eyes as he too is introduced to the world of the secret agency. This leads into a fight to stop a typically crazy plan for world domination, and as a plot I found it perfectly enjoyable.In the specifics though the film is oddly unbalanced in terms of its tone; there is an element of it trying to do that same balancing act that Kickass did, but here it does not come over so well. In some cases it is quite silly and plays to its comedic nature, but then in other ways it is very intense and dramatic with no laughs to be hand. Mostly it must be said, the film does manage to get the silliness and the violence to go together hand in hand, generally with comedic or stylistic flourishes that stop us taking it too seriously – or by killing baddies so the viewer has no moral qualms about any of it. There are examples of the opposite though, and for me the most obvious is the church scene, where we have the mass murder of civilians during a church service. The film tries to make sure the audience is prepared to go with it, by making sure we see this church being a rather vile affair preaching hatred of minorities, however it is really not enough. The scene is delivered with slick style, and an upbeat soundtrack, and feels like it should be fun – but the actual content (and my feeling on it) says that it should be horrific – because it certainly is horrific to watch. It didn't help that the US had a massive shooting a few days before I watched this (although statistically, that is never not going to be the case), but the murder of civilians in a church felt horrible (regardless of the brief highlighting of their abhorrent politics), and to have it played out in an entertaining way just did not work – it felt tone deaf, like the Kickass concept was imported but not testing to see if it fitted. This was followed by a scene of one specific violent act which was actually really well done in terms of the impact on Harry emotionally and physically – it is a great twist and an impacting moment, but like the massacre, it just didn't feel like it belonged in this film. There are other examples of this messy design, and of course the most famous is the anal sex gag right at the end. The internet is full of opinion on that so I'll not add too much; I did understand it was going for a Roger Moore Bond-style sex joke, but it wasn't funny, was delivered in a tone- deaf manner, and again it just felt totally out of place. Otherwise I though excesses like fire- work head explosions actually did work, and married violence and humor well, but the film cannot do this consistently at all.The cast are good and mostly carry the film through trouble moments even if they too seem to be unsure what type of film they are making at any given moment. Firth is a great lead and plays his part well; even getting a person into the cliché. Egerton is pretty good, not least because he makes a likable character out of someone who is mostly either a chav, or a cocky arse – with the remainder of his character covering for this. Jackson is a lot of fun in the villain role, and the supporting cast is well fleshed out with turns from Strong, Davenport, Caine, Boutella, and others.Generally the film does have enough going for it to make it enjoyable in a darkly violence way; it is well made and has a strong cast. The tone of the film is very uneven though, and there is some very difficult material in here (both violent and comedic) which needed a very good control to make it work – this it doesn't have and as a result it really doesn't work, often really pushing the viewer out of the film by how tone-deaf the delivery of it is. It is worth a look for what it does well, but those weaknesses are much bigger and impacting that they should be.",Null,3,9,9 October 2015
Ran," Plays on an epic scale but is driven by the hearts of the characters
","Lord Hidetora announces his plans to step down as Lord of his lands and, whilst he does keep title and men, all will pass to his eldest son, with his younger two sons each taking control of the second and third castle. Youngest son Saburo derides his foolishness, claiming that this will split the kingdom and that natural divisions will rise up, but he is dismissed by all and banished by Hidetora for his dissent. So the change begins and internal wrangling occur immediately with Taro's wife Kaede stirring up ill feelings in him against his father.The things about mediocre films is that often they are easiest to watch and so often I pick them over more interesting fare simply because it seems like the easiest thing to do. So-so films offer you little but conspire to take little from you other than time. So I regularly find myself in a position where I have seen lots of films but yet cannot comment on some that are considered classic. Recently I was in Paris for a week break and stumbled upon a showing of paintings and sketches by Akira Kurosawa and, having been watching some of his black and white films of late I paid my money and went in. The paintings were mostly designs for his films and yet again I found myself wondering why I had not seen these films even though I knew of them and had read about them on lots of critic's list. LoveFilm helped me again by supplying Ran off my list a few months later and I'll be honest and say it sat for a few weeks in favour of lesser stuff.Finally seeing it I regret leaving it so long because it is a great film that paints on an epic scale as a clan collapses on itself but still manages to tell the story at a personal level of the corrupted and the corrupters. Unmistakably King Lear in construct, the film is engaging throughout as we have battles and treachery all around but yet the descent into madness of the Lord is still an interesting section to the film, as is the treachery and bitter hate of Lady Kaede. It is a fascinating tale and one that benefits from the richness that Kurosawa is able to give it. His use of open landscapes and convincing period locations adds quality to the film and the whole thing is shot with a great eye for beauty and colour  credit to the cinematographer. The script is functional at times but mostly we have real characters portrayed, which makes the film more engaging as they betray and are in turn betrayed. The cast use this very well but a couple of performances do stand out. Nakadai will appear a bit overdone to Western eyes in his heavy white make-up but this must be accepted in the way it is done, which is a cultural reference. Behind this though his performance is great as he starts powerful and wise but falls through rage into madness. It is a powerful theme of the film that part of his fall is a recognition of what he himself has done in the past and how that is coming for him whether real or imagined. Harada is the second turn that sticks in the mind as she is sly evil personified; not the most subtle of characters perhaps (I preferred the similar character in Throne of Blood) but she dominates her scenes and is quite intimidating as a screen presence due to how well her ruthlessness comes over. The sons are all well played in different ways with Terao, Nezu and Ryu all having different types of material to show what they do. I liked the fool played by Ikehata and how the script used him opposite the Lord and the massive supporting cast of generals and extras are all convincing and stout.Ran does have a hard time going for it in regards modern audiences; not only is it subtitled and over twenty years old but it is also a rough adaptation of Shakespeare  not really anything that a MTV viewer will jump at. However it is worth the jump because it is a great film with consistently interesting themes, strong performances, great direction and a story that runs in the hearts of the characters but is played out on an impressively epic scale. Well worth seeking out and another reason why Kurosawa has the reputation that he does.",Null,4,7,26 December 2008
Cube," Effective thriller that sticks close to the clever premise to keep it simple and very enjoyable
","Quentin wakes up in a square room with exits on each wall. Soon he is joined by other people, strangers, who also have no idea where they are. Looking around they find that each room leads to another one that looks just the same. One of the group is the famous prison escape artist Rennes, who realises that some of the rooms are booby-trapped but that he thinks he has got the solution. With no other ideas the group follow him and try to evade the traps and stay alive  all the time with absolutely no idea of why they are here or who has imprisoned them.I heard about this film years ago but only recently managed to find it on television to watch. It is hard to think that it is almost a decade old now but that it is still effective and a regular cult movie that people will still talk about. Its power is in its simplicity  every room is the same and every next room could be safe or could be a trap; there is no reason for any of it and there appears to be no way out. Usually this sort of stuff makes for a great pitch but not always a good movie because the idea can't stretch beyond a catchy gimmick, however here it does it and makes it look easy. The whole film is our characters trying to work their way through the rooms without getting horribly killed. This in itself is gripping and at times unbearable to watch  horror fans may be disappointed that long periods go by without a lot of gore but personally I prefer tension to the delivery.At the same time we also get the characters feeding the mystery of the cube, building the tension and the sense of hopelessness without ever really solving anything. It answers questions with more questions and keeps things moving well. The development of the characters is better than I expected and I liked the way that the film played with the characters, changing them as the film went along. It isn't a fantastic character piece but again it is just something that helps keep the film moving and I suppose it was interesting to see the nature of people come out. In that regard I was also impressed by the cast. I had expected poor performances from a low budget film but actually they were all quite good. Wint is best but towards the end his performance became a bit too simplistic. Hewlett underplays and probably has the least character to deal with but is still good. De Boer was effective and interesting. Robson was a nice distraction. Guadagni was a good counterweight for Wint and played well to develop him and herself at the same time. Miller was good and the pace of the film helped distract from him basically doing a Rain Man impression.Overall an impressive low budget thriller that works because it sticks to the simple idea while building side issues with the characters and the cube around it but never actually solving anything. Perhaps it is better not to over praise it because I thought it was at its best because I didn't know what was going to happen.",Null,12,18,9 January 2006
Apollo 13," A rather straight but enjoyable drama with a good cast that could have done with a more human touch
","When the Apollo 13 mission took off to go to the moon, the television networks generally tuned out with the attitude that it was more of the same old stuff that the public had seen before and grown tired of. To the crew it represented much more of course, being Jim Lovell's final mission and his chance to finally make it to the moon itself, an aim he intends to see through despite having one of his crew replaced at the last minute by Jack Swigert. However the networks all tune in when a minor malfunction with the electrical system results in an explosion and the loss of oxygen, sending the unit out of control. With the crew retreating into the lunar module, the ground crew scramble to work out how to get them home despite the constantly lengthening odds. At the time of release this was a fairly massive film that was talked up for all manner of reasons and not all of these are still as applicable today. One thing that wasn't really talked up was the writing and the convincing nature of the plot, not a real surprise considering that these aspects seem to be delivered without a great deal of spark or flair. I know that it is based on a true story but it is hard to fully accept all of the film as some of it seems so far fetched as to be a bit silly. I'm totally open to the idea that this could have been 100% accurate but if that is the case one has to wonder how simplified the material was because at times it feels like Lovell and his crew were just blasting their way to earth. The script is OK but never really gets that involving, instead keeping a consistent stream of memorable gruff barking but nothing that really gets close to realistic dialogue. This is not to say that it isn't engaging, because it is and it does have some degree of involvement and of course historical interest but it is not as good as it could have been.The direction is good even if the effects are not as impressive as they were a decade ago  even some of the blue screen backdrops don't look that convincing. The decision to shoot some of film in the 'vomit comet' in order to convey the effects of weightlessness is a nice touch and does work pretty well, although naturally none of these shots can last very long and sometimes the editing of these shots with shots in the same scene set on the static set doesn't quite marry up. This is a minor complaint though and it does serve to make the film feel more 'real'. The ensemble cast are mixed and many have little to work with  ironically though those with the least important characters seem to have an easier time just barking out gruff dialogue. It is for this reason that the film's more memorable performances come from the ground, where a lot of the action occurs. Sinise is interesting and a key part of the rescue effort while Harris (who was in space in the much better The Right Stuff) gets the memorable lines. Of course it is Hanks who was the star at the time and he does OK; he has 'the' line but mainly his performance is not helped by the material. He conveys Lovell's longing for the moon but can only do this by staring out the window wistfully every now and again. Paxton and Bacon make up the trio and both are good without ever really having a chance to excel. The ground crew are mainly very good in their minor roles but somebody forgot to give the wives etc characters and Quinlan et al are left to just occasionally look at the TV/sky with either a touch of tears or a look of hopeful resilience  unsurprisingly none of them really made much of an impression with this thankless task.Overall this is an OK film but not anything that special. It is a glossy historical piece that lurches between convincing telling to some rather extreme moments that feel like they have been over simplified to the point of doing the reality an injustice. The cast are impressive on paper but the lack of a strong script really gives them little to actually work with, although none of them are actually bad it is possible to see that they are reaching without much help. The effects are OK but are a little dated even if the novelty of the weightless scenes is still there, but what I would have given for more of a human touch to what is otherwise an enjoyable technical product.",Null,3,7,17 October 2004
Fast Five," Noisy entertainment even though it could have done with being tighter and more urgent than it was
","Very early in this film Paul Walker's character is hanging off the side of a speeding train in urgent need to get off before it hits the bridge. Instead of jumping to the ground and hoping he can roll his speed down, he jumps to a speeding car seconds before an explosion and then goes with that car as it flies off a cliff into a several hundred meter drop into a lake. At this point my girlfriend asked how any of that had been easier than just jumping onto the ground considering that hitting water from that height is similar to hitting concrete. I couldn't argue her logic but I did have to explain that her logic and attention to detail have no place in a film franchise that has hit its fifth instalment without ever suggestion that logic or plotting are anywhere near as important as a shot of a young woman's ass and a love of fast cars.And that is the problem with Fast Five that you need to overcome, it will at no point do much with the plot unless it knows it can get from that bit of plotting to the next car, gun or ass scene with minimal effort. It is a summer movie though and the 'Five' in the title does mean that you should know what you're coming to with it. So I did my best to overlook the plot which is messy and a lacking logic at pretty much every turn – I over look it because I'm happy to surrender logic if the film can give me thrills and action. Mostly the film does, or at least it gives spectacle. Whether it is the foot escape over favela roofs or the ridiculous destruction derby of the robbery itself, the film provides you with a lot to look at and as such it is entertaining as spectacle. Personally I though the whole film could have greatly benefited from being tighter outside of these scenes and needed an injection of actual danger and tension. Instead everything happens and our characters and their cars seem indestructible, which does rather detract from the action because the viewer doesn't really 'care' or worry about what is going on – it is all about just the spectacle. Although, like I said, it does do this well.Previous films in this series have had terrible effects and some awful CGI cars (that look CGI). I'm sure computer effects were in use here but mostly it doesn't show – specifically the car chases and scenes of destruction are satisfyingly real; again they may be effects but they are very good if they are because you do have the satisfying feel of stunt men working hard in the real world – something so many effects-driven blockbusters forget about now that computers can do so much. Matching the spectacle the cast mostly do what they are required to do by looking great. Paul Walker remains good-looking and has the sparkle in his eye that makes him fun to watch in these film. Alongside him Vin Diesel looks like he is half asleep in the most part and in this film his presence is massively damaged by having to be compared to The Rock. The Rock may not have much to do but he has great presence and a real brutal charm – arms the size of tree-trunks also help his 'character' but, like I said, it makes Diesel look dull and out-of-shape by comparison (although the dull one is certainly true). Outside of them Brewster is OK despite having little to do, Tyrese brings his mouth but not the homoerotic comedy that he brought to the second film while both Pataky and Gadot have tremendous figures. Ludicrous, Kang and others in the gang appear to be in for fans of the franchise but it gives too many characters to care about – in terms of excitement and making the film tighter, it would have been better with a smaller group and tighter focus.Overall Fast Five is a fun film in a franchise that has seen some poor ones already. It provides spectacle and noise which is all one can ask for – even if I would have loved it to be tighter, more dramatic.",Null,1,3,21 September 2011
The Thin Red Line," Frustrating and flawed in some regards but generally a beautiful piece that has a poetic flow and a structure that feels you can walk inside it
","In World War II, a key piece in the battle to stop Japan's advance into the Pacific area is Guadalcanal, where they have positioned an airfield.  Into this battle comes the mostly young `C' company.  Each man is different with his own fears and hopes, but as the battle rages, the men become less important as individuals.First of all, let me just state that I shall not be comparing this film to Saving Private Ryan - suffice to say that, out of the two, Thin Red Line is my preference due to it's nature.  Too many reviews have compared the two rather than approaching each on their own merits.  What we have here is a film with a simple plot - a company of men taking part in one battle. However what Malick does with this is to create a film that is more an experience than a story.  It is hard to describe but rather than watching a story unfold I felt that I was able to walk around the film and take or leave whatever I wanted - there are no big scenes, there isn't one guy we're supposed to focus on, but the end result is still mesmerising.It is ironic that some people have complained about the lack of plot and lack of developed characters - claiming that Ryan was stronger cause it had a plot and had a collection of well defined characters.  However Thin Red Line uses the men's thoughts to tell us about them and does it very well - I didn't need these men to be ethnic stereotypes or have a back story, all I needed was who they were in the situation, and that the film gave me.  It gives a similar courtesy to the Japanese as well - this is not a film to watch if you want to cheer as `our boys' kick `their asses'.It is an overused term about this film, but it is practically a poetic experience and it is easily one of the most moving and meaningful war films I have ever seen.  Of course for pretty much the same reasons as it is good, it is frustrating and flawed.  The images of nature and the voiceovers occasionally border on the pretentious and if you came to it looking for a solid plot with men shouting `move' and the usual macho stuff like the Dirty Dozen then I imagine that this would just irriate you - however is that the film's fault or your fault for not being open to it being different from your expectations?  Yes, it does drag a couple of times in the final hour, but if you have been put in an introspective mood by the previous hour or so then this shouldn't matter.  Special mention should go to a Hans Zimmer score that is perfect - it compliments the mood of the film and it adds to the film's beauty; I stayed until the end of the credits just to be able to hear more of it.The cast is again a massive strength and a silly weakness.  The weakness comes in the overcastting with big names.  It is an impressive list but at times it is it's undoing with people like Travolta and Clooney just wasted and the impact of their characters lost because they are a blink and you'll miss it cameo.  However the collection of 10 main actors are all very impressive regardless of their screentime - this is an ensemble film and that is what an ensemble film is about.  Nolte is not always given the parts to show it but he is a fine actor - here the hurt and pain in his thoughts can be seen behind his eyes.  Likewise Koteas is wonderful.  He is a very fine actor and he delivers such a great character here - I wish he had more roles like this but we don't get to see the best of him as often as we should.  Caviezel is very good as one of the main characters (main because we see him first), I felt his character was a little too calm but he forms a big part of the film's spiritual reflective side.  Further support is strong from Cusack, Harrelson, Leto, Nelson, Reilly, Savage and others.  They don't weaken it - it is only the couple of BIG names that appear for seconds as one-offs that annoy as I wondered `why bother?'Overall, this is not a war film in the way many viewers expected it and I think that is why it is not revered in the way I think it should be.  This has little plot and does not have a beginning, middle and end structure and if you expect that then this will frustrate you.  It is not perfect but this is a wonderful experience where the soul is more important than action. The dialogue just about avoids being arty for arts sake and is thought provoking and haunting.  If you come to this with your own expectations then you will likely be frustrated - this is a film that you must come to as a blank canvas and be open to what it tries to do. If you manage that then, for it's flaws, you will be touched and moved by one of the bravest and most beautiful war films that Hollywood has produced.  In a time where the we (the UK) are at war again and are told to look at `them' and `us', this film reminds me that there is only an `us'.",Null,12,22,13 April 2004
Fantastic Four," Enjoyable, effects-driven summer fare but surprisingly lazy
","Reed Richards wants to investigate the effects of a space storm that he believes could have started life on Earth, However, out of cash he is forced to turn to Victor Von Doom, a wealthy businessman, for funding. Soon the team is altogether and on Doom's space station  Richards (the scientist), Doom (the money), Grimm (the co-pilot), Johnny Storm (the pilot) and Sue Storm (a young woman with a nice body). However it all goes wrong when the storm arrives nine hours early and only Doom can get safely behind the shields. Back on Earth, the effects of the storm start to kick in, giving the four of them amazing powers. However while they try to work out what is happening, Doom's company is collapsing, driving him into anger and rejection, while other smaller changes start to kick in on him too.Another summer, another comic book adaptation looking to kick off a franchise of blockbusters. In this regard it is no different than all the other ones; driven by special effects and noise rather than having a real depth or individualism to make it stick in the mind. These problems are obvious from the very start but it probably won't matter to those who have come for the effects because it is noisy and colourful but I was surprised by how little effort the film actually made at times. The plot is fairly straightforward but yet it also manages to be lazy at the same time  characters conveniently arrive when required and it is all too simple. In many other areas as well, it appears that the film already knows that it will get a sequel so it doesn't need to do anything special. The action is good despite being a little too sparse and simple; its quite fun and the effects are mostly good.The cast are mixed and are a surprising mix of TV stars considering the high profile of the film. Gruffudd is OK but it is hard to get behind him as a person because he doesn't have much in the way of screen presence  he is meant to be the lead but instead he is the least of the group. Alba is cutting out a risky career path for herself here  blazing a trail as a bland, pretty blonde starlet  will the trend catch on in Hollywood I wonder? She is dull as dishwater here with a poor delivery that no amount of cleavage shots can compensate for. Thank god then for Chiklis and Evans. Chiklis gets the closest to a scarred character the script gives anyone and his tough comedy and good presence is always welcome. Evans may be pretty obvious with his surfer humour but he is at least lively next to the corpses that are Gruffudd and Alba. McMahon is a bit hammy and not as much of a super-villain as I think he needed to be.Overall this is an OK summer movie but it is certainly no more than that. The effects are good and the action is fun if sparse. However the performances are surprisingly poor in key roles while the writing (in regards plotting and dialogue) leaves a lot to be desired. Not a bad film and will please target audience but it has certainly not done anything to deserve the sequel it clearly sees as its birthright.",Null,7,15,17 August 2005
Pineapple Express," A basic comedy with little for the casual viewer
","Dale is a simple man who is dating a high school senior and enjoying his job serving court summons and spending the rest of his time getting stoned on that good weed that dealer Saul keeps him supplied with. After one more visit to Saul, Dale leaves with a couple of joints of brand new Pineapples Express and carries on to his next job. Coincidentally his next job is at the house of Ted Jones  the main drug dealer in the area  and he arrives just in time to witness Ted and a female police officer killing somebody. Dale chucks his joint and flees the scene but the distinctive aroma of Pineapple Express is unmistakable to Ted and it means the witness was a customer of Saul's. Realising this, Dale and Saul go on the run but Ted's men and corrupt cops are hot on their heels.It has been many years since I last smoked but I do know that it is not a great feat to make a stoner laugh and, as such, Pineapple Express is hardly going after a tough target audience. Much like all goofy comedies, this plays well to people who are high (I think I have watched the South Park movie and Spaced loads of time in that condition) but in a more sober state of mind it is not actually that remarkable. Marketed as an action/comedy, the film plays a lot more like the many Rogan/Appatow films that have come out over the last few years (in a rush before the taste for them wares off?) and it isn't as smart or as funny as it would like to think it is. It does manage to create a tangible air of a stoner comedy but the writers seem to have forgotten the substance, because it does all feel very basic  like most of it was the first thing they had thought of.It has a few laughs here and there but way too few to make the comedy work. Meanwhile, as an action film, it relies too heavily on the comedic tone to carry it and it is not that 'exciting' or engaging. Indeed, with the comedy not really working, the body count and graphic violence are quite excessive and unpleasant because, in order to work, the audience either needed to be enjoying it as a silly affair (like Shoot 'Em Up) or as engaging action. I never really have either of these and, while it was reasonably amusing, it was never more than that. Rogen and Franco make likable enough stoners but there is not enough here to make them really engaging characters more than simple stoners. The support cast feature plenty of solid turns with Cole, Perez, Corrigan, Robinson, McBride and a few others doing good work with their material.Pineapple Express is aimed at stoners and this is pretty much the only audience that will find it a lot of fun. To the casual viewer, the humour and stoner air is the whole story as there is not a lot else to the film  not comedy, nor action. What there is is basic and lacking in imagination and invention. Ignore the hype  this is just a very basic comedy that needed a lot more criticism while it was being made and a lot less freedom to the makers.",Null,12,28,9 November 2008
John Wick: Chapter 2," Slick, but I was detached in a way I wasn't in the first film
","The first John Wick film took me by surprise; it was a cartoonish action film that was surprisingly brutal in its content, cruel in its delivery, and had a real punch to it. All of it existed inside a world that convinced in its own logic, even if it was clearly fantasy. John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to sneak up on me unannounced, which does work against it, but this is not what hurts it the most.The second chapter of what at least looks like being a trilogy, is slick and very well put together. The locations are brilliant (whether a roof garden or a larger location), the fight scenes have great choreography, and after a slow first 20 minutes it does have a great pace. But yet I found myself watching it much more passively than I had with the first film. This sense of being detached came from a couple of places. The first was that the plot did not seem as organic as the first – the violence that draws Wick deeper seems to occur just for the sake of making the film happen (which is of course true, but it doesn't try to hide it). This reduces the investment and stakes, so rather than being drawn in, I just sort of accepted it because I know where it was going.The second thing that kept me out of it was related to this lack of investment – which is that the film's lack of realism is all the stark. I do not mean that the film needed to be a kitchen-sink drama, but rather that the film cannot sell this world to the viewer. In the first I could go with this shadowy world on the edges of ours, with the idea that it developed its own rules and norms; here though it seems everyone is a hired killer, and those in charge have total power and huge organizational skills. The use of this doesn't seem worth the cost of doing such things – for instance suggesting everyone in a massive crowd is in the employment of one person and can act with the slightest nod just seemed silly and not to add value. This excess infects the action – it is overblown but could have been strong enough to engage had it not been that the majority of the film is so silly in how it works. I read Theo Robertson's user comment on this one and I think he nailed it when he said that the film could easily be in the Matrix universe – at least this would make the nonsense here ring true.This limits the film, but doesn't stop it being enjoyable. The action is slick and consistent, the style and gloss of all the moments are enjoyable, and the starry cast are mostly pretty good. Reeves is good value and does great physical work, and the supporting cast has plenty of famous faces – although some of them are distracted by their volume, or by virtue of not being well used (Fishburne is probably the one that we could have done without). So JW2 is a slick action flick, but not as good as the first film, nor as good as everyone tells you it is. The ending suggests the third film will be on an even bigger scale, with Wick literally taking on the whole world, which will probably only serve to remind me how good the first one was when it was one man seeking revenge on another for the death of his dog.",Null,4,10,1 July 2017
Annihilation," Engaging, entrancing, but the pace needs tightening, and there is not as much there as the tone suggests
","Opening on Netflix in the UK, I heard about this film because it was unusual that such a high-profile film would come direct to a streaming service rather than the 'traditional' route. I also read a tense interview with Garland where he was clearly frustrated that the film wouldn't show on a big screen, probably feeling a lot would be lost in the front room TV. Despite not doing well in the US, the reviews were good so I gave it a go.The film opens slowly, which I suppose is an early indication of how most it will go. The introductory 'chapter' structure is nothing new, but works well here, and the film has a solid tension to it as it journeys into the core of the mystery zone. As it goes, the film gets more interesting as we see more impact of the DNA changes to everything within the zone, as well as the horror and danger than comes with it. This aspect is well done but perhaps could have used more fear and urgency - when it gets it, it is good but too often it seems a bit disconnected. The pace and tone of the film suggest that it wants to be more about ideas and sci-fi themes than about horror or tension, even if it tries to do both. In terms of the former, the tone makes it feel really smart and reflective, but really there is not as much there as it suggests; at the end you'll have enjoyed the creation of this place and the things within it, but will not be left pondering the ideas or characters for long.The characters are interesting, albeit a little underserved. The all-female cast may have contributed to the film not doing as well, but probably not that much since word of the tone/pace probably kept the masses away on the basis that it was 'cerebral' rather than a 'proper' sci-fi with action and wit. Ironically, within the film the cast help it a lot. Portman is great throughout. Thompson is nicely subdued and I wanted her to have more time. Jason Leigh is solid, and Rodriguez does okay but jars a little at times in terms of not convincing in her role in the team. Supporting players such as Wong, Isaac, and a few others add quality. The design and delivery of the film is just as much of a star though; it looks great throughout, and the use of sound and music is mostly very good - I share Garland's feeling that probably the cinema would have been a much better way to have seen this.Annihilation will be a nice find on Netflix, and it is a quality film in the most part, even if there is not as much to it as it would like to think, and has issues with pacing and tone.",Null,2,6,24 March 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Lavish looking but lacking substance
","In modern day America, a journalist is approached by a handsome young man to hear a story told.  He tells a tale that begins hundreds of years prior, where he was a landowner who had lost his wife and daughter.  He tells of being turned vampire by the suave killer Lestat.  However the blessing of eternal life as the undead becomes a curse.The hunky cast is clearly a major part of the reason that this film was as successful as it was  the imdb voting breakdown shows it ranking highly among female groups.  However this is maybe not a fair reflection of a film that is certainly glossy and professional, but not as rich in depth as it is visually.  The plot is reasonable, I have not read the book so I can't compare, but the plot was thin for the majority of the time.  As a journey with Louis, it fails to really grip and involve and ends up being a little dull as it feels like it's going through the motions.  A big problem is that much of the plot is character driven  which would be fine if the film had strong characters, but it doesn't.Instead the characters are pretty bland and lacking substance.  Louis is interesting at first when he struggles with the change, but after that he becomes all slick and starts speaking in a low, quiet voice!  Most of the vampires are the same and the relationship between them aren't well done  it all feels very superficial without any meat on the bone.  The actors must carry some of the blame.  Pitt is way out of his depth and flounders with a character he is unable to bring the complexities and sorrows out of convincingly.  Cruise looks like a model and is more pretty boy than devilishly dashing  his character is a fine example of what I mean by superficial.  Dunst is OK for a child but all she really does is play the role in one way.  Banderas is a poor choice for his role and he looks a little out of place  although Rea is good in his role.Overall this film looks good and Jordan has done a good job as director. The score is effective and the film has a good list of names in the lead and support roles.  However both the story and the characters lack a substance which was sorely needed to engage the audience.  While Louis battled to keep his regrets and his human heart, I battled without luck to find any heart within this slick, glossy movie.",Null,4,11,7 December 2003
Jackie Brown," Less showy than Pulp, but a more mature story that is just as enjoyable
","Jackie Brown is a 44 year old air hostess who also acts as a money carrier for her boss, gun dealer Ordell Robbie.  When one of Ordell's other employee's is caught he is forced to kill him, however, before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up.  With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money.  However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends.Coming as a follow up to both Dogs and Pulp, this film was going to be the `greatest movie ever made' or it was going to be met with a critical response that seems to be a bit negative.  It was the hype and hyperbole around anything baring the name Tarantino that perhaps was giving every film he did higher and higher standards to meet, it is wasn't Jackie Brown that was met in this way it would have been the next film, or the next one. However the reviews were mostly good, but it did get some unfair reviews from critics who expected this to continue the upward trend.  In a way I believe that this film did show Tarantino's growth as a director.Where Pulp Fiction was dizzying in it's style and pace, Jackie Brown is much more of a mature, balanced film that is satisfying in a more traditional sense that the design of Pulp.  Developed from a Leonard novel, the plot is a solid crime thriller with a good plot that still gives room for Tarantino to do some time shifting as he reveals some key scenes from different perspectives to allow us to see the bigger picture.  As a story it fills the rather generous running time pretty well and is enjoyable throughout.The film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans - the heavy soundtrack, the pop culture references, the witty, slick dialogue.  However where the film stands out is that the characters are actually better than in his previous films where they never really went beyond the story and dialogue. Here not only are they better but they also include well-written female parts!  While some of the characters are as good as they need to be within the confines of the basic crime story, it is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit - although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script, but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters.Following the praise for Pulp and Tarantino's ability to rejuvenate careers, he must have had no problem cherry picking for this role.  Grier gives a great performance and should be grateful for the role in an industry that generally ignores middle-aged women (not to mention black women!).  The only thing surprising about her is how poorly she has taken this big lead role and used it to take her career on.  Her performance embraces her age and uses it well, but it is Forster who gives the standout performance here. Not an actor many will be aware of apart from this film, he got an Oscar nomination for this and I think he deserved it.  His performance is very low-key and quite moving - I think I will appreciate his work here more as I get older.  Jackson does what is expected of him and has no real character, but his energy and skill are there to see.  De Niro plays a little against type and is an interesting, but underused character.  Fonda is really, really sexy and has some good lines while the rest of the cast do good work in small roles with people like Keaton, Tucker and Bowen in there.Overall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is.  However to me this is a more satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery.  The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most and it sadden me to see him regress about a decade into style without substance with Kill Bill Vol. One.",Null,172,205,1 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," All the fun of the original with a much better, darker plot
","The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion.  While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.",Null,178,215,27 June 2002
Minions," Let Bob be Bob.
","Undeniably one of the funniest aspects of the Despicable Me films was the small yellow henchmen called the minions. One might wonder how best to make the most of this, given that the normal route would be to give them a spin off film – but the challenge would be to construct a film around small yellow creatures which speak in gibberish. This challenge remains, because with this film it feels a lot like they simply decided that if the minions stay themselves and remain funny, then probably few people will care that the plot is a mess.And it is a mess, with characters all over the place, no meaningful throughline, and generally the thinnest excuse for the setpieces. Of course, it is still fun thanks to the minions being themselves, and when this is happening the film is absolutely fine. The human characters are the problem though, because they are weak – mostly just devices to make things happen. Although they are voiced by some very big names, mostly the cast do very little of value, and occasionally seem out of place or poorly used. However when the main three are doing their thing, the film is funny, fast, and enjoyable – just a shame that the actual frame it all happens within is so weak.Despite this, it does have enough silliness and fun to get by, so I forgave it the mess of the plot and just enjoyed the trio being daft, which to be fair is probably what the makers were banking on.",Null,0,0,26 December 2015
Incredibles 2," Big bright colorful entertainment, although doesn't have much to it in depth
","I still remember watching the first Incredibles film and liking it for what it was, rather than what it had been marketed as. I liked its darkness, and how much of the character and plotting seemed aimed at someone much, much older than the marketing had suggested. By contrast, Incredibles 2 seems much more interested in keeping things light and fun. This makes it a slightly 'lesser' film in terms of the detail and observational elements but does make it easy viewing. The plot sort of follows a journey for Mrs Incredible, but it doesn't really build it so much as use it - likewise any emotional knock-on for the other characters is the same. In terms of what plot it uses to get with this, it is obvious enough in terms of twists and direction, but it does the job.That job is producing plenty of enjoyable action and funny moments, and does so for most viewers of most ages. The lack of darkness helps this slickness, and the 1960's vision of the future design adds to the sense of fun with its nostalgic references and look. The voice cast are all solid, even if several of them are essentially doing what they are famous for (Jackson, Odenkirk). As a whole there is much to enjoy in terms of spectacle and laughs, but it doesn't run much deeper than that, making it a lesser film, but probably one good enough that you'll not feel the impact of that till you reflect back on it.",Null,1,2,9 March 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," There is a creative sadness in here, but it is heavily masked in sporadic plotting, hidden meaning and a dreary tone
","Like almost everyone who loved or hated this film, I do generally like the Coen brothers and am not against having to do work to enjoy and appreciate a film. This is an important thing to say because Inside Llewyn Davis is certainly not a film to come to as a casual viewer just looking to kill a few hours – not as a snobby thing of 'you'll not appreciate it' but just a reality that the film does almost nothing to help the viewer. The plot involves struggling folk musician Llewyn Davis in the Greenwich Village scene of the early 1960s; he is not particularly commercial, is irresponsible, downbeat and cannot look after others or even the cat belonging to others. We follow him over the course of a week which will change his life and see the world around him change too.I really did want to like this film because at times there is a certain beauty to it in the pained reality of its lead character, his situation and his gradual realization of where his life is and where it is going. Unfortunately this is generally spread very thin and instead of having a structure that supports this, we instead get an episodic approach that makes the 'week' feel like months, sees characters just come and go whether we have an interest in them or not and generally doesn't allow you to do more than grasp at metaphors which drift by – usually resulting in the people who love the film the most being those who brought a lot of their own selves to the table, leaving us who look to the film to at least help, feeling left out in the cold and even a little bored.The music is beautiful when it comes and the cinematography is excellent as it captures and shapes the feel of the film and the character – it is bleak to look at for sure, but it is suitable and effective for what the film is. The same could be said of Isaac's performance because it is what the film needs him to do but the downside is that it isn't really what the viewer needs him to do. His personal journey (physical and emotional) is made harder b the coldness of his character – there is really not much to grab hold of here and he is generally difficult. As often is the case with the Coens, we have characters drifting though the story usually in a colorful fashion – the times it has worked in other films has been frequent but here I didn't think it did at all, with nobody seeming to add much. As writers of the material and directors of their cast the 'blame' (depending on your view) belongs with the Coens as they have made this film very difficult to get into.Full of supposed metaphors and with a sadness which is put in the distance look of its title character rather than in his heart or in the audience's line of sight, the film drifts along with a general sense of sadness and change which always interested me but just seemed deliberately out of reach and distant. I'm sure if you 'get it' then it is a film to adore, but for me it just didn't work at all.",Null,7,11,8 March 2014
Sin City," Target audience will love it & it's a nice contrast to the usual summer fare but the sexual violence and depiction of women will be a problem to some
","There is no denying that, for a mainstream Hollywood summer blockbuster that visually Sin City is impressively different, stylish and quite daring. Not only does it provide George Lucas with a simple lesson in how to effectively use a blue screen, but it also provides an experience that looks unique and fascinating to be worth a look. The characters are all larger than life, the backdrops drip with smoke, grim, corruption and hopelessness and only occasionally does the CGI look clunky or the actors have the body language of people who are totally disconnected from their surroundings. The mix of black/white and colour is perhaps a bit obvious but is still a nice touch and, although I didn't think it pulled it off, the attempts at film noir played well with genre clichés.Because the stories and characters are larger than life, the narratives do struggle a bit and it is only their pace and unrelenting grim violence that makes it possible to stick with it. However after about an hour I had got the idea (it is stylish, gritty and violent) and it didn't have much more after that  I never got bored but the more time went on the less impressed I was by it. The style of the film is grimy but it is no film noir in the sense that those familiar with the genre with be used to  instead of being suggestive it is blatant, instead of being sensual it is vampish, instead of being dark it is gory. While this is not a major problem in itself, the film does feel like it is dressing in clothes that are too big for it and aping films that made this all look so effortless many decades ago. Despite this, it was still so far so good  not enough substance perhaps but the style and genre clichés still were enjoyable.The only really troubling aspects of the film come in the form of the women. All the characters are stereotypes designed to appeal to the adolescent male in the audience  whatever age he may actually be; men are grizzled, bloodied and yet somehow invincible until their heroic poetic deaths while the women are gorgeous, sexual and available. Although hardly useful for a character driven film (which this never is) it would have been acceptable  certainly these are roles that endless action movies cast the two sexes into. However with Sin City there is a constant, unpleasant air of sexual violence and fetishistic domination of these women that left a bad taste in my mouth  I'm sure the film is just being true to the material but it is difficult to swallow nonetheless. In noir, the women are often controlling of the men and if anyone destroys them, it is often themselves. Here women are beaten and they like it, they need men to protect them from other men, they are gorgeous but give it up like it was a bad habit, generally they are not defined by who they are but by what they are  'dykes', strippers, whores, rape victims and killers; that they are not real people is not a problem but the film's depiction and use of them within the narrative goes beyond the mere 'trophyism' of music videos and adverts and is very close to being misogyny so harsh and spiteful it is.Thanks to the pace and style though, I was mostly able to put this out of my mind and enjoy it as a comic book noir that appeals to those who like the noir style without having to watch old films and miss out on extreme violence and MTV flesh. Miller deserves credit for the style but Rodriguez brings it to life convincingly well. His cast are mostly good because they buy into it with such conviction, although, lets be honest here, other than the makeup and gruff voices, the male actors didn't have a massive stretch of their skills. Willis plays a role he had played so often it must be like second; Rouke is better because his character seems dumber and driven by love for a woman that didn't care for him (see  that's film noir) and I liked what he did with it. Stahl is pretty good and Clive Owen takes to the 'hard man cool' like a duck to water. The male support cast are pretty good even if Boothe, Duncan, Hauer and Wood just come and go in minor roles. The women all look great and that is pretty much all that is asked of them. Dawson is gorgeous and playful but can't have been comfortable in those clothes; Murphy does her usual playful smile thing but just don't expect her to bring any gravitas to a character thrown between abusive, doomed men  not only doesn't she, she never tries. Alba is OK for all she does but the presence of Aoki proves that it is more who than what you know in the business. None of the women are that good but then this is not a women's film and they are only there for one thing.Overall, complaining about male/female stereotypes in a summer blockbuster is a bit like taking a bath and moaning about getting wet, but the degree of sexual violence and the depiction of women does take some swallowing and will be a big problem to some viewers. The grimy style may smack of someone aping noir rather than 'doing' noir but it is at least refreshingly different from the usual summer fare. The lack of depth is a minor problem but it still works thanks to the pace and engagingly gritty and dark story lines leaving me in no doubt that (as shown by the presence of Tarantino) that this will have the geeky 'fan-boy' target audience hunched over, furiously loving every minute of it.",Null,11,20,20 June 2005
Saboteur," A solid piece of Hitchcock that plays like a halfway house between 39 Steps and North By Northwest
","Barry Kane works at an aircraft factory at the height of World War II and as such security is high. When a fire breaks out in the factory Kane, his friend and a man called Fry run to put it out but when the fire extinguisher Fry provides turned out to be filled with gasoline, Kane's friend dies a horrible death. The factory destroyed, the investigations begins and an emotional Kane tells his story. However with no evidence of any 'Fry' or anyone else who knows him, the authorities suspect that the fire was the work of Kane himself. Unable to convince them otherwise, Kane goes on the run to follow up the few clues he has  knowing that he must get to the Nazi saboteurs before the police get to him.With a wrongly accused innocent man on the run looking to find the real perpetrators in order to clear his own name, this film plays a bit like a remake of 39 Steps crossed with a dry run for North By Northwest. Although the basic plot device is very familiar now the film is still quite a bit of fun. At times the plot is a bit baggy and does have sections that could have been cut back in order to keep the film moving at a quicker pace but generally everything is engaging and enjoyable. As this is a Hitchcock film we have some solid sequences and set pieces such as the party that is impossible to leave and the memorable conclusion on an American landmark (both basically replayed in North by Northwest). These are enough to move it along even though. The script seems to have lots of people trusting Kane, which I didn't totally buy and felt it was a bit simplistic to only have saboteurs on one side and 'good' people on the other.Hitchcock directs with his usual style and uses shadows well to build tension. He has a nice awareness of the comic even in a tense scene and the humour works well at times as a contrast to the building tension. Some reviewers have claimed that Cummings was a dull leading man; I'll give you that he is no Cary Grant in terms of screen presence but he does a good enough job given that all the script requires is a believable 'everyman'. He doesn't have as much chemistry as he could have done with Lane but then, I didn't think she was that good herself. The baddies are not that flamboyant but they are a welcome presence in the film and I enjoyed the turns from Kruger, Baxter and Wolfe to name a few.Overall this is a solidly enjoyable film. Not as pacey and fun as North By Northwest but fans of that film specifically or Hitchcock generally find it worth watching. The cast are not that impressive but they do the job  just don't expect them to stand up to stars in some of Hitchcock's later films. His touch is evident though and the film looks great, being unmistakably his work and all the better for it.",Null,3,4,2 April 2006
The Ugly Truth," Fairly generic and obvious but still passable on a sort of genre level
","The Ugly Truth is summed up by the poster which sees the two stars leaning and turning their bodies away from one another in the time-honoured way that suits a film that has no intention of doing anything new or challenging but rather just turning out what the viewer expects. So it is that two people who initially hate each other are forced by a plot device to spend time together – I wonder if it is possible that they will somehow fall for each other at some point? No, surely not, I mean they clearly dislike each other from what I can see.And so it goes. Anyone who cannot see where the film is going within 5 minutes (or even just the poster) has simply never seen a film in this genre before – because it does almost exactly what you expect from start to finish. Along the way we have comic misunderstandings that are as basic as they are elaborately set up and of course a general emerging chemistry developing – none of which will be a surprise to the vast majority of viewers. The plot is secondary to the comedy though and in this way the film does have a certain obvious charm to it thanks mainly to the enthusiasm of Heigl in the lead role. She is likable and she commits to delivering the material and really does sell it in the most part. It is a shame that the supporting cast (including several famous faces) could not have been better used to deliver lots of side laughs to strengthen the film, but they were still reasonably good.Butler overplays his 'gruff real man' role, slurping his coffee quickly used as a character shorthand – stuff like that. I didn't really like him that much and I don't really see the appeal – nor did I think he worked particularly well with Heigl, although this was perhaps down to the base material more than just his performance. He does what the material asks of him though, so in regard I guess he is OK for the film. As I said, seeing people like Hines, Higgins, Brown and others not really given the material to work with was a shame – normally a cast is populated with people like this so they can provide colour and one-liners in the background to help provide a sort of comedy base for the main plot and cast, this wasn't really the case here.So The Ugly Truth does just what you expect it to do across a film filled with the elaborate and unlikely comedy situations that you can see coming and often hope don't arrive. It is not a particularly good film but it is not a bad one – just about doing enough to provide the easy, undemanding and instantly forgettable genre fill that the majority of viewers will have come to it for.",Null,1,3,22 August 2010
Gangs of New York," The narrative and characters are weak but the general sweep and spectacle of the whole thing makes it worth a look
","In the 1840's New York is a mess of gangs all fighting over small areas of turf. The main rivalry is between the immigrant Irish and those who see themselves as Natives of their New York. A battle rages between them and the leader of the Irish (Priest Vallon) falls to the blade of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting  witnessed by Vallon's young son. Sixteen years later and things are different but no better. Cutting is now the head of the Five Corners and all the gangs answer to him. It is into this situation that an unknown man called Amsterdam returns  none other than the grown son of Priest Vallon. Seeking a fitting revenge for the death of his father, Amsterdam makes sure he catches Cutting's sole eye and gradually is taken into his trust.Despite lukewarm reviews I decided that any Scorsese film is worth a look and gave GoNY a night of my time. In terms of plotting the film is essentially a revenge drama that sees Vallon trying to get close enough to Cutting to take him out in a fashion befitting the man. You might rightly point out that such a straightforward tale does not require 180 minutes to tell but it does when the film tries to make this much more of a sprawling affair that aims to bridge the cinematic gap between the western and the gangster films while also painting a rich tapestry of characters against a rich background of 19th Century New York. However it fails to do this on several levels and the end result is a film that feels a lot baggier than it really should have done. This is best seen in the characters because none of them really develop beyond the first impressions they give, or a better example is the failure of the film to use Jenny in the critical way that she was clearly intended to be used.Scorsese may lose his way with the story but it is easy to forgive him because he does so well with the majestic historical sweep he gives to everything else. The sets look great, the costumes look great and the dramatic flair he gives in delivery add so much. It is a real problem that he has not taken the characters and story along for the ride but I found his silver lining to be enjoyable even if his rather OTT approach did further take away from the realism of the people and the story. His approach is matched by the cast, who are mostly enjoyable despite lacking depth. DiCaprio is more than the bland pinup I had feared he would be but he can't do much more than play the 'silent revenge' card from start to finish. He is overwhelmed by Day-Lewis who has great fun in a fantastically OTT role that worked much better than I expected him to. Diaz is not that good and I felt she was miscast in an attempt to get 'credibility' by working with Scorsese. The support cast is roundly good and features solid turns from Neeson, Reilly, Gleeson and many others fill out a strong cast.Overall this is an impressive film in terms of sweep and style but not in terms of story and characters  which is a bit of a problem in a film that pretty much lasts three hours. The skill of Scorsese and the presence of so many stars make it worth a look but it is hard to get past the problems in the way that the story is not as well done as it could have been, even if the general historical sweep and spectacle makes it worth taking a look at.",Null,99,154,25 February 2006
The Cabin in the Woods," Entertaining and smartly written and delivered
","I'm no great fan of horror movies and in particular I don't really like gore, so although I heard good things about this film, it never really appealed to me. I'm not sure why I ended up watching recently but I was very pleasantly surprised by what I found. Although the film opens in some sort of industrial/clerical banality, very soon we are in familiar territory as a group of college students head off to a cabin in the woods for a fun weekend. Despite the warning from an old man in a gas station about the dangers ahead, they continue up to the dark old cabin, where they find some weird things – although perhaps not as weird as what lies ahead.The plot is bang on the genre tropes for a reason, and it does it very well. It is almost ironic that as a 'cabin in the woods' horror, it is pretty effective in how it works even though it is mostly meant as a pastiche of the genre. True enough it is not particularly scary but it is gory and effective in the way that so many of these things are. The contrast with the men in the offices is nicely played on many levels. I really enjoyed the linkage to modern horror films from different cultures, and the passive and humorous way in which they went about their job. I'll not say too much more than that, because although it an aspect of the film that unfolds from the start and throughout, my enjoyment was greater for not knowing anything.The delivery of the film is good. In the horror sections it gets the tone right, but also balances it very well with dark humor – with neither detracting from the other. The cast are very good at what they do. The genre horror cast not only hit their marks but hit them well; Hemsworth and Connolly play their roles well, while Williams and Hutchinson have less to do but are still good. I enjoyed the Ash-referencing Franz a great deal. Meanwhile Jenkins and Whitford in particular do a good job with their side – delivering with good comedy but convincing work. The special effects have a good quality of looking trashy but still effective – very b-movie.The Cabin in the Woods is not as good as you have heard – it is one of those films that catches a lot of people by pleasant surprise, and as such it probably got a bit more hype than it could support; however it is an enjoyable film which cleverly plays with the horror genre while also delivering a good genre film at the same time. The comedy works surprisingly well and in the end it is a nicely written and delivered film.",Null,1,4,5 November 2014
Windtalkers," Noisy but the lack of story and lack of unique style in the action just leaves it as a fairly run-of-the-mill war action movie
","After a disastrous military command where he lost all his men and part of his hearing, Sergeant Joe Enders wants back into the action. Faking his way through his medical he is soon back in action, charged to protect a 'windtalker' one of the Navajo Marines who are used as code talkers to keep radio signals secret from the enemy; protect him that is, unless capture is imminent in which case Joe is to kill his charge. Put together with Private Ben Yahzee, Joe struggles to keep it together in battles where his rage drives him on, but his growing friendship with Joe threatens his entire mission.Despite the names involved with this project, nothing else about it really grabbed me when it came out at the cinema; the action just looked noisy and the story looked like it would be lost in all that. Never let it be said that you can tell nothing from the trailers because it turns out that this is exactly what the film is like. The story is interesting in terms of a very basic piece of history but, beyond the one-sentence summary, there isn't really anything to learn. Being mostly fictionalised, the script still needed to create its own story to hook me and mostly it failed to do this. I never got involved with the characters and the few scenes where they share some corny dialogue or fire guns with a haunted 'terrible-regret-and-hurt-in-my-past-that-I-can't-let-go-of' look in their eyes were not enough to create interest. Unsurprisingly the massive, noisy battle scenes dominate the film (easily without much to compete with them) and for many viewers these will do the job  for me they at least provided energy in the film.However what surprised me was just how unexciting they were. So much is going on, so many things are blowing up that it is difficult to really get into it. Yes, in Face/Off and the likes, we had everything blowing up but that was fun and done all in the name of pure silly entertainment. With this I think Woo felt he couldn't make was 'fun' so he seems to have lost his style, his unique flair for action and his ability to produce some very big, overblown, outrageous action. It is all visually impressive but partly down to the lack of style and partly down to the lack of substance I just didn't think it was anything special to make it stand out. In fact, this last criticism could go for the cast too  which was a surprise when you consider the names involved.Cage has clearly been told by Woo to do that 'crazy, slightly haunted look' and to do it over and over again, so that is what he spends most of the film doing. The rest of it he spends looking soft and wounded as he stops worrying and learns to love his Indian. Beach is pretty and he does make for an attractive character but the lack of depth leaves him pulling faces and jumping around just like everyone else. Considering his high-billing, Slater appeared to just walk in and out of the film as if he was required somewhere else. Stomare does nothing much but then nor do Emmerich, Ruffalo, Issacs and others who you would expect of at least being interesting.Overall this is not a poor film, it is just a very average and unmemorable one. The lack of a good character-based story (or story full stop) means that the noisy action dominates and, without any unique style, flair or real excitement to that, it does become rather tiresome after a while. Of course if this is all you are after then it is probably noisy and violent enough but you should bare in mind three things: 1) there are more exciting action movies out there, 2) there are more meaningful war movies out there and, 3) there are much better John Woo films out there. With so many options, it is no wonder that I'll not be watching Windtalkers again anytime soon.",Null,3,6,25 July 2005
Spectre," Solid and enjoyable even if it could have used more character and spark to make it more than 'a Bond movie'
","With all the hype around this film, it was hard to come to it as just another Bond film and not the 'event' that the release of a new one has become. However, it is best to come to it as such, because essentially this is what it is – another Bond film. Drawing a lot from the series already, and recreating very famous organizations and characters, the plot sees a continuation of the road of the previous films, with a message from beyond the grave sending Bond in pursuit of something he is not quite sure of. In doing so the film essentially delivers a lot of elements that we have come to expect from this recent run of films, and from Bonds generally.The pre-credits sequence is not quite as thrilling as it was billed, but is still a solidly enjoyable series of stunts run together (although I suspect the technical achievement of the helicopter sequence is probably more impressive than just watching it). From this point onwards the film runs a familiar course, which is not a bad thing, but too often the film seems to forget to thrill as it should. No doubt it is robustly constructed, and the quality and crafting is evident in almost every regard, but this is not always a good thing. Bond himself feels a little bit on the rails, and pulled along by the plot. Of course an element of this is that this is precisely what the plot of the film is, but at the same time I didn't get much 'person' from him compared to previous films, and his later connections with Swann didn't remedy that. Likewise too many other characters do what they say on the tin – and it was only really Whishaw's Q that had some spark to him. Craig himself is strong as a presence, and this does bring out the feeling that he could easily have delivered more given the chance. Seydoux is a throw-back Bond girl, needing rescuing and not having a great deal of character. Waltz is a great villain because he is very good at this sort of character – so watchable in the last few films he has done, here they give him space and dialogue to be an imposing presence, and he does it well. The rest of the cast are very much supporting and doing so in defined roles – which is fine but seems a shame with so many big names.Spectre is still a solidly enjoyable film; it doesn't live up to the hype, or the pressure put on it by Skyfall, but it is still a solid Bond. It does all the things you expect it to do, albeit with a rather workmanlike feeling that will make you wish it had been delivered with just a bit more spark and energy to it at key moments.",Null,0,4,26 December 2015
Coach Carter," Solid and enjoyable if somewhat unremarkable sports movie
","The pupils of a Richmond, California high school have little in the way of academic potential and, in their basketball team, little to celebrate in way of sporting achievement. The team and the players get a shakeup when local sports store Ken Carter accepts the job of coach of the basketball team. Making the players focus on fitness and sign academic contracts, the team revolts but quickly comes round to the tough new regime. He technique works on some levels as the team goes on an undefeated run in the league, however when the players start falling down in other areas, Carter holds to his original promises no matter what others think.The fact that FilmFour is playing this film at all times of the day on freeview should perhaps give an indication that this is not a 'special' film that is worthy of great attention. It isn't and nor did it get any. This is not the same as saying it is a poor film though because it is certainly not. Although it is based on a true story, it is, at heart, a sports movie that sees the underdog team winning despite the odds. Along with this it does have the message of the importance of education and respect rather than arrogance and 'NBA or nothing' attitude and for this it is hard to dislike it  and I suppose it isn't that heavily delivered. These elements work well together and make the film engaging enough without ever being anything particularly inventive or original. If the film is 50% accurate in regards Carter then certainly he deserves more  particularly within the sport of basketball in US, not a minor activity by any means.The heavy soundtrack shows the target audience and is sadly another demonstration of the lack of invention in the delivery although everything is competently done  the direction didn't wow me but the sports action is well shot, which is not that easy to do. The cast are likewise solid and effective without ever excelling. Jackson goes into 'father-figure' mode for this and it works well as his screen presence carries him a long way. He is well supported by the players themselves; OK some of them skate very close to being stereotypes but Gbewonyo, Brown, Gonzalez, Tatum and others all hold together well. Not sure about the casting of Ashanti. Yes she is sexy and adds appeal to this MTV film but she never feels the age of her character and instead just gets by being cute.Coach Carter is a MTV film that offers sports and a 'message' and it pretty much does what you would expect and is still good even though it is anything shockingly new or inventive. It is solid across the board and an easily enjoyable film based on quite an inspiring true story.",Null,0,0,11 September 2008
Moon," Not as awesome or as twisty as the hype suggests but certainly a very engaging and thoughtful sci-fi (SPOILERS)
","It happens frequently but the summer blockbuster season makes it worse. Critics are keen to jump on a bad big budget film to make it out to be the worst thing ever because reviews that lay into a film are fun to write. Conversely any film that is actually 'good' comes as such a surprise that sometimes it can be over-hyped and over-praised to the point where one goes to a 'good' film half-expecting it to be the most amazing thing ever. That has kinda happened with Mood in two ways. Firstly it has been over-praised but secondly much of the praise has been around the 'twists' and avoiding talking about plot points for fear of 'spoiling' the story.I can respect this approach but in doing this the suggestion is made that this is a film full of plot revelations and twisty surprises – the former of which is sort of true but the latter is not. Moon does have a very good little story about it that is thoughtful, engaging and quite moving but it doesn't shock with revelations or twists and most viewers will be at least a few minutes ahead of where the film is going – not because the film is 'predictable' but more because it gives the audience respect that we will be able to follow and understand for ourselves to the point where the logic of the situation pulls us along. So, for example, the reason why 'original Sam' is getting ill is not really a mystery because it is clear that the '3 year contract' really means '3 year shelf -life'; this is not spelt out for us and it is not slapped down on a table for us to see either – it just is the case and it makes sense within the film's internal logic.I can understand why some viewers have found this to translate into 'nothing happening' or being very slow in delivery but I don't agree with them beyond acknowledging that that was their experience and opinion. To me the simple concept is very well done because it is so focused and tight. Things do not fall into a space battle with guns and explosions but, while there is a forward motion with the plot, a good chunk of the drama comes from the feelings and realisations of the two characters. That said, it is not as smart or as well done as one would have liked. The 'news coverage' conclusion feels like it was the easiest way to produce an ending to the plot but it seems too pat and, while it feels like it was meant to 'answer questions', by 'closing' the story it actually reminds the viewer how many unanswered parts there are to the bigger picture. The character drama is not as good as some would say either but it is helped immensely by Rockwell giving great performance(s). He is part of the reason we feel for his character(s) and are drawn into the film. He would have benefited a great deal from more scenes that stretch him (like the live video link to his daughter) and fewer where he is hanging around but he does still give good work. The supporting cast are limited in input but while Spacey does a good job with his computer, the others are solid enough not to distract in their small roles.Visually the limited budget does show but this appears to have been accounted for by giving the entire production a rather endearing lo-fi feel that does match the reality of the future. Too often everything is shiny, white and clean as if dirt has been eliminated and expense is not a limiting factor; it feels more convincing to have things done on the cheap and be worn and old. It has been said endless times already but it does have an engaging '70's' feel to it and, in the wake of the mindless, boring rubbish of Transformers 2, it is nice to find something good being made under the sci-fi banner. In contrast to the models though, the split screen effects are really very good.Moon may not be the perfect film that some viewers have seen, but this should not be taken as a criticism because it is still a very good, low budget sci-fi. It doesn't totally delivery in the keys areas of plot and character but, even as it falls short of what could have been, it still delivers enough in the way of intelligence, thoughtfulness, silent tension and plot to make it a very good little sci-fi that is well worth seeing if you get the chance. Or, to put it another way, a choice between this and GI Joe ids no choice at all from my point of view!",Null,5,8,20 August 2009
True Romance," Tries a bit too hard but is still enjoyable
","When Clarence meets Alabama they hit if off immediately and fall in love. So when she reveals she is a call girl hired to get him laid on his birthday it doesn't matter, and they get married.  Clarence decides to make Alabama's break from the job official by collecting her stuff from her pimp. However when that meeting turns into a bloodbath he mistakenly picks up a suitcase full of drugs.  The pair say their goodbyes and make off with the drugs to sell them in LA, however the drugs leave a track behind them, one that both the mob and the police follow.In the height of Tarantino fever, several of his scripts got quickly dusted off and handed to big name directors in an effort to capitalise on the public flavour for his dialogue and mix of pop culture references and violence.  True Romance was one such film and, in fairness it does fairly well to emulate the films of the writer himself - big cast, snappy dialogue, violent shoot outs and so on.  In fact the film lifts his style to the extent that it even rips off (or homage's) other films - most notably in the theme music that is almost a photocopy of Badlands.The film wears this a little too obviously and clearly is trying very hard to be Tarantino-esque, most of the time it works out but at times I just wanted it to relax a little bit.  The plot is pure geek wish fulfilment mixed with crime thriller; a beautiful woman picks up a comic-book fan in a cinema showing a martial arts triple bill!  It works reasonably well by filling the scenes with colourful characters, pop culture dialogue and violence - at times it gets a bit much and I wanted characters to talk normally without a wall-to-wall soundtrack just some of the time; however it does have some very good scenes at times.  Stand outs are the scene with Walken and Hopper and the scene where Alabama takes a beating, but, if you like Tarantino's films then you should be happy with most of this.The style of the film is a little uneven.  As I said, it is really trying hard to be a Tarantino film but at the same time you can see Scott's glossy action-movie hands all over it!  The two don't really fit together all the time and would honestly rather have had a different director at the helm. The cast however is as deep as Tarantino films were drawing at the time - everyone wanted the chance to be cool!  Slater is cool and fits the role well and even Arquette manages to be quite good, although her narration is about as flat and dull as they come.  It is the support cast though, who the film belongs to.  The film has roles for a variety of people whether it be non-speaking roles or one or two scenes.  In a way this is a bad thing because some great actors have nothing to do and are wasted but overall the effect is good and each cameo makes an impact.  When a cast includes Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L Jackson, Victor Argo, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore it has to be at least worth checking out!Despite the fact that Tarantino's words in another directors hands doesn't feel that right, and the fact that Scott's very slick Hollywood direction doesn't quite match with Tarantino's much less establishment writing this is still a good film.  As you'd expect it rips off every `lovers on the run' movie that you'll have seen but it still is funny and slick enough to stand up for the rather generous running time.  It may bottle the brave ending of the original script but it has some very good scenes along the way.",Null,25,50,1 February 2004
Her," Good ideas and generally works but it is overlong and forces its emotional importance too much, ultimately undermining itself
","I recently watched the Charlie Brooker film Be Right Back, which is part of the Black Mirror series (one which is flawed but I would still recommend to anyone) and I mention this because thematically that film has a lot in common with this film. Those who want to look smart will tell one that this film is a lift of Brooker's but this is not the case, although it is true that both deal with a person having an emotional relationship with a programmed personality. In Her we see online letter writer Theodore going through a divorce and feeling disconnected from the world. He purchases a new operating system which boasts an adapting and learning virtual personality, one which unsurprisingly he develops a chemistry with as she helps him work on his organization. Soon they are hanging out together and something approaching a relationship begins to develop.The ideas and themes within this film are very interesting and mostly very well presented as it deals with the idea of virtual personalities and software that 'knows' us and is able to adapt and learn to appeal to us and interact in a way that fits us personally. Perhaps once such an idea would have seemed far-fetched but nowadays we already have websites suggesting other products or people or films or music we might like based on our habits or purchases, so it is not a million years to go beyond this. So in terms of the concept of the film, I liked it and was already sold and having recently really enjoyed Be Right Back, I was looking forward to Her. As usual any film that is tied up in the Oscars will be subject to hype and I did try to ignore it but this is a film that I do think has been overpraised because, while it is a pretty good film, it has plenty of flaws and is not as good as you will have heard (and without a doubt if you are watching it in early 2014, you will have heard about how good it is).The central ideas provide a link to those of us who make use of the internet, which is most of us. We have friendships going back a decade where we have never actually met the people involved; we have real-life relationships that have become virtual as they migrate onto Facebook status updates etc being the only point of contact as the real connection fades; some of us may even have connections with online characters who are no more real than their pixel visualization. The point is that the film will speak to many viewers in this sense but in terms of the romance side, it is probably aimed at those in their late 20's or older who have seen relationships start, change and then drift apart. So essentially I am target audience for this film but yet for me it didn't quite work as it thinks it did.The first problem is the length because at 2 hours it is about 20 minutes longer than it needs to be and this is time that could easily have been found since there is a lot in here that doesn't add much. The bigger problem is that the film is intimate, vulnerable and personal – well, sorry, it being this way isn't a problem but it knowing that it is, is the problem and it forcing this aspect is the problem. Through the cinematography, the music, the performances and everything we have a film that really strives to be emotionally deep and impacting, rather than simply being that way. It is hard to describe but it starts to feel forced and artificial at several points and it blocks what it should be doing. What remains still works, still engages and still provides food for thought but it tries too hard for too long to convince you of its emotional impact that it overdoes it too easily. It is frustrating because the simplest moments of the film work the best but it soon pushes past this and loses the idea in its unique version of sentimentality. The direction, the look of the film and Phoenix's performance is part of this. The latter is a shame because on the face of it Phoenix is great – he is on screen alone for most of the time but works very well as a vulnerable soul finding a foothold – but around him the film and this performance combine to be excessive and I grew tired of his slumped sadness contrasted with smiling contentment. Johansson is better although without a body she will never be equally considered for the awards. Supporting roles range from the out of place (Wiig) through to the 'nice money for a few minutes work' (Cox).Her is one of the films hyped to greatness in the 2014 awards season and frankly it doesn't deserve it. The ideas behind it would work better if it were a shorter film which doesn't overplay its hand but lets it come out in more of a natural fashion. As much as I liked aspects of it and specific moments, it doesn't deliver as it should and it is disappointing for what it doesn't do just as much as it pleases for what it does. People talking about Be Right Back in the context of Her ripping it off are wrong in terms of their subject but correct in bringing up Brooker's film – those watching Her should be aware of it, but not because it is a copy but rather because it is the superior film of the two.",Null,2,6,14 February 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," An energetic, stylish and engaging fairytale that has enough about it to cover the main weaknesses it has while you are watching
","This film came to the UK on a wave of Oscar hype and critical praise and I was looking forward to see it even though the reasons 'why' it was good seemed a bit vague to me. On one hand it seems to be set in the gritty poverty of India, with descriptions of some very unpleasant scenes but then, on the other hand it was described as being uplifting and the feel-good movie of the year. I was curious how this conflicting information resolves itself within one film without off-balancing it.The overall sweep of the film is very much a rag-to-riches story with love being the real heart of the film even if 'money' (or a game-show for money) is the narrative driver and essentially it is modern day fairytale. In this regard it is an excellent film because you are engaged throughout, are totally on the side of the main characters and ultimately the viewer would give anything if they could only end the film happily. In this way it is uplifting and (ultimately) a really cheering film that is worth seeing with an audience because it is one of those things that unites an audience with a common feeling of cheer and goodwill. The method of delivery really helps the plot work because it is colourful, frantic and stylish.I really enjoyed the fragmented time structure that uses the re-watching of the Millionaire questions in the police station as a trigger for flashbacks. This means we are gripped by several threads/times rather than it being a straight flow. It is not an amazingly unique device but the manner of it being put together prevents it ever being clumsy or obvious by how it transitions from one time to the other. Speaking of delivery and style, the film is understandably an Oscar contender generally thanks to its upbeat nature (after darker material last year and the current downturn in the world, Oscar probably will look for some feel-good stuff) but the areas I think it stands a great chance are those of cinematography, editing and direction. I say this because visually the film is a treat. It captures the colour of India with great camera work that puts us right in the scene. An example is the early chase through the slum, with a frantic camera, plenty of colour (in terms of palate, places and people) and a great visual style with the sun hitting the camera from above as it moves and other effective devices. With this much movement in the camera throughout the film, the editing is key in making these scenes work and it is excellent throughout  even putting the subtitles in a stylish and arresting fashion which helped sell the use of Hindi but does also match the style of the film more than standard text would have. As director Boyle delivers on all this and his use of music is great as well. It does feel like we have the grit and style of City of God but yet also the warm uplifting story of the very best the 'underdog' genre can provide.That it achieves this is a testament to how well the film is delivered because it does have to overcome the fact that the majority of the film presents us with a terrible world of poverty and suffering and then gradually pulls the main characters out of it. This is a problem that the delivery covers but ultimately the viewer is left with some fairly harrowing realities that haven't gone away by the end of the film. I totally understand those who love the film unquestioningly but I do agree with those that take pause on this issue and note that it is an aspect of the film that really doesn't stand up in the cold light of day. You see, it is gritty and it is unpleasant and, although not based on a true story, this is a reality in our world and to see so much of it in a film that ultimately leaves you feeling good about life and happy that everything worked out alright is not a mix that sat particularly well with me. It isn't helped by the dance number over the end credits, which involved lots of people and pushed the 'isn't everything great' idea more than the proper conclusion of the story did. I didn't like this part of the credits for this reason and also it would have been nice to see a film based in India that didn't feel it had to 'do' Bollywood.The cast mostly play to the 'fairytale' side of the film more than the grit, although the young children are very impressive in the first sections of the story. Patel took a minute to grow on me but, although not the most charismatic of performers, he is really steady as the underdog who is driven. Kapoor is a great villain, driven by a hate that says a lot about the class system in place. Pinto is stunning and has a much stronger presence than Patel. Khan works the investigation scenes well, which was important as these are where the story is told from. There are no real weak links in the performances  the fairy-tale nature of the tale means everyone has to focus on that side of it but they are still good.The film is not as perfect as you will hear but it is still very good at what it does. It is a wonderfully stylish and slick romantic fairytale that is cheering and uplifting but of course this does give the slight problem that it is a stylish, slick and uplifting film that features horribly real images of cruelty and poverty. It doesn't manage to reconcile this but it is strong enough to make you ignore this for the vast majority of the time, leaving you tense, hopeful and weepy.",Null,52,80,1 January 2009
The Nice Guys," Solidly engaging and entertaining, but never as funny or thrilling as it appears to be
","Somewhat of a throwback of a film, which is perhaps to be expected from Shane Black. The odd-chemistry of the mis-matched buddies are what drives this film, while the noir-esque plotting and style helps it too. The film has a reasonably engaging story-line, good casting, good laughs, some good action, and plenty of specific moments that make it enjoyable. And it was enjoyable, however this is different from saying it is a great film – because it isn't.In the moments or specific aspects, it does work, but as a whole it seems disjointed and unsure of what it is trying to be. Instead of it feeling like one common film as it flows through moments of varying tone and content, it feels like a series of moments of different tone which have been pieced together to become a whole. In some ways it is dramatic with a wry comedy, in others it is pure slapstick, and then again in others it asks us to take the plot seriously. Mostly it works in this, but it never totally convinces either.A lot of credit for it working should go to the casting and performances from Crowe and Gosling. They work very well in their characters; in particular Gosling manages to make his daughter work as a relationship (as poorly judged as she is as a character), and even makes things like a Lou Costello / Lethal Weapon-style moment work. The supporting cast features plenty of familiar faces – some work well, but some others only serve to remind of better films (Basinger and Crowe together nods to LA Confidential – which is too good a film to be put in the viewer's mind when watching this).It is all solidly entertaining stuff, but it never wholly comes together in a way that makes it stick in the mind as a great film that I'd love to see more of.",Null,3,7,18 September 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Admirable in its commitment and scale, but certainly not what the hype suggests
","It seemed to me that few people did not totally love this film, and I cannot think of any time on social media or reviews that I saw many negative words about it. So I was keen to see it once it came to being released for the home viewing. Undeniably the film is committed to what it is doing and it seems determined to make this world real simply by the force of its own will. As a result there does not seem any excess that is out of place, even if for me personally this also worked against the film. The simple plot allows the action to be the all, and in some ways it is enjoyably metallic – with impacts, grinding of parts, the smell of grease. However on the other side the sense of vaudeville that it has detracts from the actual feeling of tension and violence it should have. That it didn't manage to draw me into its creation meant that the constant action felt like a show rather than something with real consequence and risk.That is not to say that it isn't enjoyable, because as a show it is often quite the show. I am not sure why this content-light blockbuster got so much praise versus any other blockbuster heavy on action but light on plot, but it did. Visually it is endlessly interesting; the crazy nonsense of the vehicles and the action sequences combine with some great cinematography – over-saturating everything and adding to that sense of otherworldly extremes. The cast do the same and have that 'committed' approach that the film has – whether their performances make sense or not. Theron is the most engaging of the piece, with a very strong and yet emotive character. Hardy is a good presence but surprisingly not particularly interesting as a title character. Hoult is better, and the female support characters see good turns from Huntington- Whiteley (I know – surprising), Kravitz, Eaton, and others.It is a film that simply does what it sets out to do and doesn't seem to worry about whether it will work or not. In this way it does have strong forward motion, and never lack confidence. However the sense of performance and show to it does rob it of a hook to draw the viewer in, and as such it is always a blockbuster, even if the grimy metallic aspects suggest it is more 'proper' than other films doing much the same for a wider audience. Good for what it is, but certainly not worthy of the endless waves of praise hitting it this summer.",Null,7,13,26 September 2015
The Breakfast Club," Lacks subtly, real laughs or real emotion but is still an OK genre film
","A Saturday morning is the last time anyone wants to be stuck in school, but that is the fate of a group of five high school students who have each been given detention for various reasons. With nothing in common but their location, tensions are immediately evident within the group with drop out Bender trying to out-macho jock Andy by competing for the attention of the prissy Claire. Meanwhile the geeky Brian and the reclusive Allison just seem out of place. While principle Vernon tries to keep control, the group fall out and then start to share themselves with one another, bringing about an uneasy bonding between them.Although I think this is an OK film I must admit to being a bit bewildered by the high regard that many viewers seem to hold it in. The plot is a fairly standard piece that relies more on the characters than any great narrative devices and, while this may work for some I found that the characters were not well enough written to really carry it. While elements of each character is recognisable none of them really stand out as being original or that insightful; in essence they are the characters you find in any high school movie and it never develops them to the point of being critical. Instead their issues and hang-ups are just accepted and it quickly turns into lots of teenage hand-wringing and complaining. If that sounds a bit strong then I suppose it is because the film still does enough to make things work and it does have enough within each character to be interesting but the problem is that, with so much of it being obvious, the clever bits tend to sound a bit corny rather than insightful.The cast are perhaps a little to blame because they do such a good job of playing rather annoying, up-themselves teenagers that that is exactly what they come off as. They are all OK and do manage to reveal layers within their characters but the surfaces of their performances are pretty obvious and it takes a lot to get away from that. Judd is the weakest because he takes so long to reveal anything in his character that by the time he did I had lost interest in him. Estevez is OK, Ringwald is suited to her character but Sheedy has little to do and Hall really just brings up the rear as the geeky comic relief. They are OK like I said but the film tends to go from 'loud school tomfoolery' to 'quiet introspective revelations' at the flick of a switch and this lack of subtly damages proceedings somewhat.Overall this is an OK film that probably doesn't deserve the reputation it has garnered over the years. It has good aspects but it lacks subtly or gradual development and the actors can't help this even if they do reasonably well. It provides some laughs and some nice moments but generally it doesn't do either that well. OK genre piece but nothing special.",Null,4,11,22 February 2005
Gladiator," A great revenge movie that is not as worthy as it thinks it is but is still a great movie
","Maximus is the favoured commander of Emperor Aurelius' armies in Germania. He is favoured to the point that the Emperor, sensing his death is near, commands him to succeed him and return Rome to a republic.  Caesar's son discovers this, kills his father and orders Maximus dead.  However he survives and, finding his wife and son murdered, is captured by slave merchants and sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.  As his skills increase his strength he eventually comes to the games at Rome, where he finds himself anonymous and within striking distance of the revenge he seeks.If you strip away all the period settings and political battling in the background, this film is essentially a revenge film and a good one at that. It's best to ignore the liberties it takes with both logic and history and enjoy it for what it is.  At times it does threaten to take itself too seriously, but it's worthy sheen is just about supported by the emotive story and strong characters.  The film hits a good mix of political goings-on and action, with the action being the main body of the film.  It is delivered in bloody spades and the action scenes are a lot more dramatic than I expected.Although the characters fit into traditional revenge movie moulds (wronged man, evil man in position of power etc) they still manage to be strong characters in their own right.  Maximus is a strong hero and it is hard not to feel for him and thus get involved in the film.  True, the script is very generous in it's painting of him but this is a minor issue.  Crowe takes the lead really well and, while I don't personally care for him, he really fitted the role here.  Phoenix plays it well despite the fat he could easily have given into mugging the evil role.  Harris is good in his small role, although Jacobi just shows up once or twice.  Reed has a good part for his swansong but this is really Crowe's film and he commands it as his character does his army.The close of the film always gets me as it treats the characters and audience with respect (although it is not as daring as some would suggest. Overall this is a great film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously or go looking for flaws.  The music and direction gives it a great feel  the music in particular used to support the required emotions created by the action.  Three hours go by very quickly and enjoyably.",Null,6,16,26 October 2003
Contact," Very interesting and worthy but, my god, but it is full of itself!
","Since childhood, Ellie Arroway has been interested in space and radio signals, spurred on by the death of her parents early in life.  As an adult she is a scientist who listens to space for signals from the stars, however her programme has it's funding cut and she finds herself looking for private funding.  Four years after securing such funding, she discovers a mathematical signal from space.  As the Government gets involved the signal reveals more information - thousands of pages of mechanical schematics. As the design is built, the world reacts to news of alien life.It is hard to complain about a film that tries to be an intelligent sci-fi at a time when the genre reaped greater box office rewards if you were shooting them like Independence Day.  It is a shame then, that the film doesn't totally work as a whole, even if it has moments that are thought provoking, exciting or interesting.  The plot is great in essence, however it bogs itself down with too much in the way or spiritual philosophising and emotional back story that, while being an OK idea, just complicates the issue unnecessarily.  The essential questions of who and why are lost in bigger debates that the script simply can't cope with - turning some discussions into weird pillow talk between Ellie and Joss!What it does do well is capture the fight between religion and science in this area - both come off equally well and it was well done that the film didn't slant too much in favour of either.  The politics and religious zealotry is given a bit of a pushing - but the good thing is; it never actually felt unlikely!  In fact, if anything, the project being a multinational project and scientis given a reasonably public free hand is more fiction that some elements here.  The film opens very well with a great pull back into space, where you really feel the vastness of space, and ends with a visually impressive scene that would have had much more impact if it had just lost the whole emotional back story connection (regardless of `to make you comfortable' reasons).  Between these two moments the film generally keeps things moving with the sense of discovery, but it does regularly get bogged down and it needs a terrorist to add some action - we could easily have condensed or lost a good 20 minutes of this film and things would have been better for it.The cast is quite deep but they don't all do well.  Foster is very good I felt, her character is developed reasonably well for a sci-fi and her performance is good.  McConaughey is less fortunate, his character is a bit of a mystery to me and the early scenes with him are pointless apart from setting him up for later.  Morse is lumbered with a horrid two-part role, neither of which is very good.  However the support cast is good and includes such actors as Woods, Fichtner, Skerritt (who is surprisingly welcoming of the aliens all things considered!), Lowe, Bassett, Busey, Hurt and Bill Clinton as himself!Overall this is a good film despite being weighed down a script too full of sentiment, back story and unclear philosophising.  The essence is good and it has a basic good story, start and ending.  I enjoyed it and have seen it more than once but it is remiss of me not to admit that it easily could have been tighter, smarter and more satisfying.",Null,8,18,3 February 2004
Donnie Darko," Confusing, dark, difficult and confusing but very enjoyable and worth the work
","In the small American of Middlesex lives Donnie, a disturbed teenager, in psychoanalysis and on a programme of medication.  One night a large figure in a rabbit suit (Frank) appears to Donnie and takes him out of his home in order to tell him that in just over 28 days the world will come to an end. While out Donnie house is struck by an aeroplane engine that crushes his room and would have surely killed him.  Donnie follows Frank's instruction as they grow increasingly violent as he tries to prevent the world ending and turn time back.I, like many others, came to this on the back of rave reviews but I knew that this film is a CULT movie.  That means that not everyone will get it or enjoy it.  I fell within the first category but not within the second.  The plot is a strange mix of high school movie cliché and a weird hallucination (?) that is Donnie's world.  The two sit well together and both work separately.  The high school stuff finds Donnie in a boat many of us have been in  that of a teenager disaffected and misunderstood by everything around him.  On top of this alienation Donnie must cope with the darker world of Frank  a darkness that is brought out really well and is genuinely creepy.This side of the story is the difficult bit.  There are big question marks that surround what is actually going on with Frank and, even after the film has finished it remains unclear and you'll be left wondering `what the heck was that?'  However it is a fantastic ride and you'll be totally sucked into the world of Donnie.  It's not a classic film because of this  too dark for many and maybe too frustrating in it's ambiguous nature for others, but it is one hell of a movie that'll amuse, chill and entertain long after you finish it.The direction is faultless.  Shadowy stairwells cast beautiful shadows and blue skies and picket fences give way to dark visions and destruction.  The use of music is also good  80's soundtracks may not be a fresh idea but here it is used sparingly and to great effect.  Some is over familiar but in fairness most is well known but gains value from how it is used with the action onscreen.Gyllenhaal is a great lead and brings an immense depth to the film, his laid back approach mixed with the dark haunted looks he can draw upon add to the feelings of both menace and reality.  The rest of the cast are all great and throw up a few faces I wasn't expecting  including Mary McDonnell, Swayze, Barrymore and Noah Wyle from ER.  These aren't distracting and don't take away or add to the film's value simply by their star power.Overall this is well worth a watch.  You won't get it first time but you'll have fun thinking about it and running over the meaning in your mind.  I'm coming to grips with the whole time travel thing but am still questioning my own answers.  Please remember than this is a cult movie that is wearing a multiplex outfit (just like Frank).  Many will find it confusing, challenging and just too plain weird but most will enjoy it even if the meaning is confused and difficult.",Null,15,33,4 November 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A dark plot ruined by silliness, corny touches, pointless franchise characters and everything done OTT just because they can afford it
","What is there left to say about this endless franchise? I guess that the summer season will always produce overblown effects movies that make for easy crown-pleasing noise – it may as well be the devil we know rather than one we don't. This third film opens with a surprisingly engaging rewriting of history to place the Transformers at the heart of historical events from the middle of the last century. This is the preamble to a story that sees the city of Chicago in ruins, people vaporised in front of the camera and a plan to enslave humanity to rebuild the lost world of Cybertron. I'm not suggesting it is Shakespeare but for sure the plot on the face of it offers at least something of interest.Sadly within seconds of his opening, we are introduced back into the same nonsense that makes these films so difficulty to enjoy. The silliness of the dumb 'comedy' that they try to introduce, the overly wordy plot exposition (these films normally assume that most of the audience are too dumb to follow without it all being explained via one character explaining things to the other) and just the sheer unnecessary overblown nature of everything that does hurt the film badly. The plot is hurt by it because it is not given room to breathe, while we see plenty of devastation, we are never allowed (or even encouraged) to feel anything about any of it. I'm of the opinion that interesting sci-fi can still be full of action – but this film seems to be in an either/or camp because it is all about the spectacle here.Once we do get rolling with that though, it is hard to deny that the film is technically very impressive. The effects are great and the sheer scale of it as a film is impressive – Bay has an ego for sure, but given the cost and the complexity of the projects he pulls of, one can understand why. And make no mistake he has done what he set out to do with this film – it is just that personally it is not enough for me to simply have effects thrown in my face. If only some of the effects shot money could have been put towards the script then maybe we could have had decent characters, or comedy that is funny, or a tone that actually draws the audience in. Sadly we get none of these things, all we get is a constant audio/visual assault that is good for that, but that alone. The action does impress even if it doesn't engage and, as much as it is an overused device, I did appreciate the slow-motion simply so I had a fighting chance of seeing who was hitting whom etc.The script is responsible for the silly dumb comedy (Sam's job interviews?) and also the unnecessary characters that are now just cluttering up the screen. So Sam returns which is understandable, it is hard to jettison your main human character, but he is a poor character – an unlikeable little oik portrayed with the usual lack of charisma and presence by LaBeouf. As we all know Huntington-Whiteley replaces Fox and her part in the film is made clear from her first shot (it is of her legs and ass). This is all she is and, while easy on the eye she is stiff and unnatural throughout the film, feeling like little more than a doll. While she is poor, she is not as annoying as the many returning characters who simply add nothing but brand-familiarity; it also hurts that several of them are played by very good actors. Turturro is an embarrassment – nothing else to say. Gibson and Duhamel are both good at the 'running with guns' thing but their presence as characters is daft and again hurts the narrative. Dempsey is a decent turn while McDormand at least has the decency to look like she's there for the money and do as little as possible. Dunn and White return as his parents – someone thinks their characters are funny and worth bringing back to do the same old stuff over and over, they are wrong. John Malkovich does a stupid and unnecessary character that achieves nothing but earn him money and lose him respect. But this isn't an actor's film is it? It is about the action Overall Transformers 3 is just what you expect it to be. Not quite as bad as the second film but it has all the strengths you expect (technically expensive) and all of the weaknesses too (almost everything else). It is an 'event' movie so the normal rules don't apply, but I liked the plot and I liked the effects – a bit of work on the script, dropping loads of characters, dropping sappy rock ballads and maybe letting the camera stay in one place for longer than 2 seconds and MAYBE this could also have been an enjoyable film rather than a technically impressive battering. It is empty and lacking atmosphere, heart and intelligence while it rushes to throw as much action and money onto the screen as possible – whether the audience care about what they are seeing or not.",Null,1,4,23 October 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," An ambitious film but it doesn't pull it off despite being worth a look for Cruise alone
","Having had an all-American upbringing in Long Island, Ron Kovic leaves school and decides to sign up for the marines to represent his country in Vietnam and make a difference. Having seen all manner of horrors, Ron is shot and wounded in the field and finds himself in a veterans hospital where he hopes to regain the use of his legs despite the advice of doctors. When he realises he will never walk again, it starts his mental collapse and he becomes increasing disillusioned with the country and he lost his legs for.There is nothing I dislike more than hearing uninformed people from other countries spouting about Northern Ireland so I'll be very careful about launching into any sort of preaching  I'll leave that to Stone himself. It isn't that I don't want to know more it's just that I have so much to learn about my own culture and history that who has the time for wandering off to learn about America's! Anyway, there is no need for me to get on a soapbox because this film has a darn good go at doing it by itself. The basic plot is fine and very involving, mostly because it is a real person, not just a character but it weakens its impact by playing to the simplistic side of things. For example there is no question about Ron being a clean cut, shy boy, nor is there any complexity about how badly he is treated afterwards. In some regards this is fair enough but at times I wished that Stone had not been so strong in his sense of moral outrage because it doesn't give the subject the balance and subjectivity that it deserves to be presented with.This alone does not make it a bad film however, and it isn't ever bad  just a touch heavy handed at points but it is very difficult to watch impassively and uninvolved. The film shows Kovic's collapse and gradual disillusionment really well in a way that stands for the mental and/or physical suffering of many vets who must have come back to find that the sacrifice they had made was not even supported by the vocal section of the populace. In a way, focusing on this one man makes for a story that is intimate but also has wider significance but in another way it means the film has to go into very specific areas that don't work so well. In particular I didn't think that Ron's Mexican trip worked that well and some aspects of his life were simply forgotten about (Donna?) and I wondered why they had even bothered to include them at all. Anyway, despite these comments the film still worked for me and it is an impacting story even if Oliver Stone is not the person I would have chosen to tell the story  a very good director but 'non-partisan' is not a term that could ever be laid at his feet and at points this film gets a little sermonising as a result.A big factor in this film working is a superb performance by Cruise who was still, at this point, a clean cut poster boy and not the one I would have imagined taking this role! In the first of two performances that I believe he should have won an Oscar for (the other being SA for Magnolia), Cruise is very brave and very strong in the lead, convincingly taking us from a patriotic young boy to a injured soldier to a broken man to a man trying to put all the pieces together. Credit to both Cruise and the editor that this is done convincingly and without too many big jumps in character. Outside of Cruise though, nobody is really given a great deal of material to work with and all their characters are pretty two-dimensional and fleeting. If anything the support cast's main impact is to keep bringing well known faces to the screen; these include Barry, Sedgwick, Whaley, Baldwin (times two!), Dale Dye, Berenger, LeGros, Bob Gunton, Vivica Fox, Mike Starr (and brother), Dafoe, Sizemore, Eagle Eye Cherry, Wayne Knight and John C McGinley. Few of these have much to do but it is impressive how many faces there are that have since gone on to become well-known actors in their own right (I personally was surprised to see McGinley's only contribution being pushing a wheelchair or Fox being on screen (topless) for about 3 seconds with only one line) but this actually takes away from the film more than it gives now.Overall this is an impacting film but not a great one. The story has a few bits that don't really work and aren't delivered very well, while Stone's direction occasionally gets all preachy on us but, although the now all-star cast are not great, Cruise is superb and deals with the difficult role well.A very ambitious film and not one that manages to get it all right but still a film that is hard to ignore even if the same subject has been done better in other films.",Null,51,94,23 August 2004
The Social Network," Smart, snappy and engaging thanks to good writing, performance and structure
","As someone who has never joined Facebook and don't have any desire to do so, I approached the film on the subject with a certain caution since, although I was aware of the various back and forwards legally between all the individuals involved, I had generally treated it with only slight interest because I really don't care to consider how much money those involved now have. So it is to the film's credit then that I was easily held for the duration of the film and that the two hour running time zipped past. Opening with a scene of rapid-fire dialogue that only people in Aaron Sorkin's world talk in, the film keeps up the pace throughout with lots of snappy and convincing dialogue. This is also impressive when one considers that the majority of the 'action' is either occurring in coding within computers or in stuffy conference rooms between two legal teams.This is where the importance of structure comes in and the film effortlessly moves between the two lawsuits and the events themselves as they unfold. None of it is in flashback per se but rather the audience is being told the story and getting to know the characters across the different time-zones at the same time without any real problem in terms of losing the audience or fragmenting the telling – it is a very strong structure and one that is edited together really well. In the telling, Zuckerberg is the focus and he doesn't come off well at all (although I imagine his immense wealth will perhaps soothe him a little). Here though he is very much an intellectual geeky type, difficult to get to know and, once he is able to 'be himself' one discovers that actually he is even more of a jerk than when he at least had some sheer of politeness about him. He is the cynical heart of the film when it comes to the rather selfish manner in which the business unfolds – with Zuckerberg caught up in himself and seemingly motivated by some deeper sense of failing and inadequacy that manifests itself in a barely concealed jealously.Thankfully the film balances this character with the much more sympathetic Eduardo, who is really the heart of the piece in that he allows us to see Zuckerberg more clearly by virtue of outcomes and not just actions. How much these two and their relationship is dramatised as opposed to fictionalised, I'm not sure, but within Sorkin's script they both work well. Fincher also delivers and makes the film feel cinematic despite its very talky and chair-bound nature. He produces great shots, sets the scenes well and produces good performances throughout. Eisenberg stopped being the poor man's Michael Cera for me with this as he produces a character that he really understands and gets into – it isn't that he is saying the lines in a certain way so much as it is him 'being' that character so that the rather bitter edge to him is always there even when the scene doesn't need it to be more than a shadow. Garfield is equally good and does make a lot of the scenes with his more emoting character, while Timberlake is great – OK a rather swaggering character but he pulls it off well. In support there are plenty of good turns from Hammer (who does great with his two roles), Mara, Jones and others and the only ones that did distract me a little was Disney's Brenda Song and a totally silent Adina Porter (True Blood) who seemed to be in a character that one would normally just stick an extra in – I doubt she was actually even in focus once during the film.Anyway, True Blood fan gripe aside, The Social Network is as strong as everyone says it is. It has the snap and pace that you know it will have thanks to Sorkin but it also has a strong base of characters and makes this tale of invention, betrayal, business and lawsuits into a fascinating and engaging character-driven thriller of sorts. The performances and direction are all on the money to make the most of this great script and the film does stand as one of the best of 2010 – hopefully the upcoming Oscars will reflect that as well.",Null,6,9,19 February 2011
The Wedding Singer," A funny Adam Sadler film!  is this a sign of the apocalypse?
","In 1985 failed rock star Robbie Hart is the best wedding singer in town. However when his fiancé leaves him on the day of their wedding his world is turned upside down.  However a burgeoning friendship with waitress Julia helps him back on his feet.  However when he begins to fall for her he finds himself at a loss as she is engaged to be married herself.A funny Sadler film!  Clearly an one off but why not enjoy it while it last? Clearly Big Daddy and Little Nicky are the final nails in his career coffin but here he created a generally good film.  The story is actually quite good - it is a love story but it isn't cursed with heavy slush or sentiment. Instead the film has a real good laugh at itself by laughing at the time period.  However the jokes at the period are not too derisory and it's not cruel.The story is littered with direct jokes, side jokes, period jokes and sheer outrageous laughs (namely Hart's song inspired by the Cure!).  There is much to like here and the film is supported by a range of hilarious characters, the only complaint being that it's all a little neat (and feels too short).Sadler is good and, believe it or not, he gives a subtle, believable, likable performance - surely not!  Barrymore is good in a `good girl' role that she rarely gets.  Alexis Arquette is funny as George even if he is an one-joke character.  However the funniest characters are those that do cameos and have funny characters rather than funny jokes - Jon Lovitz is hilarious as a rival singer (he's losing his mind!), Frank Sivero from Goodfellas is strangely funny as Andy (oh great now I've got water all over my pants) but the best is a wicked cameo from Steve Buscemi as a drunken best man (`the better man!').  The only cameo that doesn't work is Billy Idol - he just looks scary!Overall, even if you hate Adam Sadler (I do) it's hard not to be taken in by this innocent little charmer with it's gentle humour and great sense of period.",Null,2,5,15 February 2002
The Pursuit of Happyness," Almost too heartbreaking to be uplifting even if it ultimately does it, but still engaging and driven by another very good performance from Will Smith
","Chris Gardner is a struggling salesman who finds himself having to look after his son when his wife gives up and leaves him. Using his charm as much as his academic record, Chris wins his way onto an internship programme of twenty, with only one job at the end. He has the determination to make it but with no salary and almost no income from his sales efforts, Chris finds himself homeless and increasingly desperate as he tries to keep up with his peers by day and survive the rest of the time.This is an unusual film that, were it totally successful, could be called a victim of that success. Certainly the story it is telling is uplifting and very much testimony to the determination and courage of one man to make it despite tremendous odds. OK so he is not diving into burning buildings to save babies but it is still an engaging and inspiring story because of the sheer endless scale of the challenge and disappointment. It also helps that the sheer weight of soul-destroying challenges that he works through makes it almost impossible for all but the hardest hearted viewer not to feel happy for Chris when he finally makes it (as we know he ultimately will, or else his story would not be a film!) even if 'making it' is 'making money', which some viewers may find to be not totally worthy in itself. Ironically though this same weight of events also works against the film because it does make it a consistently hard watch. It is praise in a way because I personally tensed up with every added sorrow and this happened because of how convincing and heartbreaking this festival of misery and unfairness was.A massive part of this working as well as it does is Smith's performance. I last saw him in I Am Legend where I thought that the narrative development in that film totally undid his wonderfully convincing performance in the first half. Here again he is quite brilliant  utterly convincing, showing a flicker of spirit deep within him while also clearly showing each kick, each challenge on his increasingly worn face. Smith junior could have been one of those terribly cute-kid type roles but just about avoids it. Sure he is cute but he is not annoying, mainly because of how natural he is. I think he is really helped by the fact that he does seem to be able to act (or at least 'pretend') but more than he already has a relationship with his father that feeds their on screen one. They work well together but ultimately the film is owned by Will Smith, who is great.Overall then this is an engaging and ultimately inspiring film but not one that is a lot of fun to watch. By virtue of how convincing Smith and the overall delivery is, I felt the tension in my own body, felt the crushing blows of each misfortune or challenge. It helps the film in a way but it did seem like the 'uplifting' material is a long time coming.",Null,2,3,27 April 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones and the lost sense of fun!
","Indiana Jones is recruited by Walter Donovan to take up the search for the holy grail and find his father - lost on the same quest.  What he finds is a trail leading to the grail hotly contested by Nazi's seeking the cup that brings eternal life.  Joneses Junior and Senior race against time to find the Grail before the Nazi's.After the disappointment of the second of the series this was a chance to redeem the series.  Temple of Doom was too nasty and gorey to be totally fun.  Raiders of the Lost Ark was huge fun with very little reality and this is what is brought back here.  The plot is similar in theme to Raiders, with many of the characters brought back.  The fact that some of the story is just ridiculous is easily overlooked by the fun and the fact that it's tongue is firmly in it's cheek the whole time.  Speilberg knows it's a bit silly and OTT at times, but rather than let it be a downer he lets it add to the fun of the whole thing.As with the others in the series this is packed with great set pieces - some with comedy mixed in (such as the Joneses trapped in a burning room) others with great action (the chase across the desert) and others with gore (the conclusion).  It's all good old fashioned fun to watch and tremendous fun all the way.Ford is as good as ever and seems a lot more at home than when he did Temple of Doom.  Connery is a great choice for his dad (despite him only being 12 years older than Ford), his easy going attitude contrast well with Ford's action hero.  It's also good to see Dermot Elliott back again (and very well used) as well as John Rhys-Davis.  British comedian Alexis Sayle makes a surreal appearance and the bad guys are very much carbon copies of the Nazi charicatures used in Raiders.Overall this is tremendous fun and more than makes up for the disappointment that was Temple of Doom.",Null,5,16,25 January 2002
Back to the Future," Very entertaining film  as slick as it is fun as it is engaging
","In 1985 teenager Marty McFly is a bit of an outcast and spends his evenings hanging out with eccentric professor Doc Brown and his various crazy and failed inventions. However when Doc asks Marty to meet him late one night in a mall parking lot, he learns that Doc has invented a working time travel system and inserted it into a DeLorean. Much to Doc's joy and Marty's surprise the machine works on its test run and Doc is all set to be the first man to travel in time when he is killed by the terrorist group who stole plutonium for him with the impression he was making them a bomb. Marty flees in the DeLorean but accidentally winds up back in 1955. Back there he convinces Doc to help him out and come up with a way of getting him back to the future. However the problem of no plutonium appears small when Marty changes the past and stops his parents meeting and falling in love.In its own way this is a classic film that delivers the goods in the same way as Frank Capra's films does although I can understand why for some it doesn't hold quite the same appeal. The plot seems complex as it involves time travel and such but it is deceptively simple and is a clever mix of sci-fi and romantic comedy that is as light and enjoyable as you could hope for. It never makes fun of itself but it never takes itself too seriously and by doing this it pitches it just perfectly. The narrative may be light but it is consistently engaging whether it is the time travel aspect or the relationships. It isn't perfect and it isn't the deepest of films but it is effortlessly a lot of fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.The cast are roundly great and are a big part of the film being as light and fun as it is. For my money this is Fox's best all-round performance and he plays the clean-cut American teenager really well bringing energy to the character. Of course Lloyd's performance dominates the film by its sheer colour and energy, making him the most memorable character of the piece. Thompson and Glover (two people who still look young twenty years later damn them) are both good in their roles and work well together and individually to make their part of the narrative match up to the (superficially) more appealing sci-fi stuff. Zemeckis directs with an eye for a memorable shot and visually his film matches the style and vitality of the narrative.Overall a very good film that is every bit as pleasing as the Frank Capra feel-good films that are held up as classics. Whether this film is a classic is as much up for debate as those films' classic status but it isn't really a debate that means a lot to me. What matters is that the film is engaging and entertaining, which it consistently is. It glides through a slick plot and I always enjoy it when I revisit it. Well worth taking a look if you are after a great piece of family fun.",Null,6,11,4 August 2006
Goodfellas," Classic modern day gangster film
","Starting with the 1950's, we follow Henry Hill from a teen who tries to realise his dream of `always wanting to be a gangster'.  He goes from running errands for Paulie Cicero to become a trusted man within his organisation.  Working with James Conway and Tommy De Vito, Henry navigates his violent lifestyle where death is never more than a few steps away.For my generation this was one of our first introductions to Scorsese doing a real tour-de-force of a film - I was too young to appreciate Raging Bull and his 70's work when it first came out and the eighties were a quiet period (except the brilliant king of comedy).  So here was a great introduction to a fanatastic director.  The plot is spread over such a long time (in terms of story years) that it's hard to get beneath the surface events, but this is a very minor problem given that it's such a great ride. The focus is on events and the culture rather than a deep story and as such Scorsese works with set pieces and events rather than too much characterisation.  However the story moves so effectively through the action - Scorsese uses long tracking shots, pumping soundtracks and scenes of building tension and sudden violence to create a masterful experience.The weakness with lack of depth is really put to the back of your mind by the action, the direction and the performances.  The story is well held together by Hill's narrative and the shallowness is easily over looked. Liotta is excellent as the aspiring gangster and is full of self seeking menace.  De Niro does what he does best in terms of the Irish gangster role but the standout is Pesci.  Pesci gives a strong role as the vicious Tommy and deserved his Oscar.  The rest of the cast are all excellent whether it's major roles (Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco) or minor characters (Frank Vincent, Sivero).The real star here is Scorsese - he uses the camera and the soundtrack to great effect and gets great performances from his cast.  A modern gangster feast.",Null,17,29,30 January 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," An imperfect but enjoyable and refreshingly old-fashioned thriller in a CGI bloated summer
","Having been under for several years, Jason Bourne is brought to the surface by an attempt on his life by an assassin and the fact that the CIA come after him when he is placed at the scene of the murder of a CIA agent in the field. Innocent but just wishing to be left alone, Bourne comes out of hiding  seeking to bring down his former bosses and clear his name. All the time however, events are complicated by his memory coming back about his violent, deadly past. Empire magazine called it  they said in their feature on this film that the Bourne Identity sneaked out and calmly and efficient went about its business. In the same way Supremacy came out in the UK with seemingly none of the hype and massive marketing that preceded films such as Spiderman 2, Catwoman and others. Without the same exposure to this hype I came to the film looking for nothing more than a good film  I didn't see it as an event in the same way as other blockbusters. The film has a quick set up with Jason having dreams before launching into a twisted mission that starts a pace that never lets up until the film's wonderfully low key conclusion. The plot is very thin  frighteningly thin in fact. I have not read the book but I cannot imagine, given the thickness of that tomb that much of the source has made it to the screen. This is a bit of a problem for me because the film comes across as a bit superficial and, although I was taken by the potential darkness of the material, most of it was simply used to provide edgy action as opposed to thought. This changes in the odd scene but generally it is about the action.And this is not a complaint that I am making with too much effort because, personally, I found the film to be great fun and it was the action that covered the problems in the material. The pace is good, never dipping by accident and generally keeping me either interested or right on the edge of my seat. The basic plot allows this (it doesn't need too many introspective moments) but it is also greatly helped by the direction. Greengrass uses the same hand-held camera style that was so very effective in Bloody Sunday and gets a similar result here. At times it makes the action hard to follow but it also serves to increase the energy in the scenes and make them feel more urgent and a lot more brutal. Some will be put off by the way it jutters around but it has been done well in everything from NYPD Blue to 24 and Greengrass uses it well here too. The film's washed out colours and use of darkness (or under use of light) also helps make the film feel edgy and moody more than a summer blockbuster deserves to be.The action scenes are the film's selling point and they act as somewhat of a beacon in a summer that has been full of CGI event movies  even if some of them have been good CGI event movies! Here the fact that the actors are not on wires or the fact that the action scenes do not just exist on a PC only help make the action scenes feel a lot more dramatic and urgent  of course they are not any more 'real' than some of Catwoman's antics but it is a refreshing change to really believe what you are seeing. There is little fancy spectacle but, like Bourne himself, the film is brutal and efficient even if it is unshowy.Damon himself is a big part of it and, in Jason, he has found a role that allows him to act with only a tortured look at the same time as he is able to use his body. The fact that his character is an unknown makes his performance easier and, in this sequel, it is good that they make him a more difficult character (even if they don't expand him that much); I hope they round this off in the third and final film. It may not be a difficult performance to give but Damon still does well and holds the attention well with a character that has been rightly described as the anti-bond. Stiles has a small role yet again, but at least it makes more sense now why she bothered with the role in the first place. Cox is his usual gruff self and the only downside of his presence is that, after such films as X2, we have come to expect him to be a shady, conspiratorial military/Government type and nothing more. Allen is also good and makes more of a balanced character than Cox and is better for it  it'll be interesting to see if she is used well in the third film or if she is made too complex. It is a credit to Damon though that he emerges the star even with the other names involved.Overall this is an imperfect film with a surprisingly thin plot that is not really as dark and edgy as it would like to think it is. However it has a great pace, good direction, tough scenes, great (non-CGI) action, energy and these all combine to cover up these weaknesses and deliver a solid, old fashioned thriller that is not an 'event' in the same way that other summer films are but is perhaps a better film for standing out from the crowd in this regard.",Null,3,9,23 August 2004
The Proposal," Nowhere near charming or funny enough to cut it
","We all know where we are going here right? When pushy Canadian boss Margaret Tate pretends to be engaged to her assistant Andrew in order to avoid being deported due to a failed visa extension it certainly seems like it is an unlikely coupling – particularly because of how hard-nosed she is about any intimacy or love. The two have to go away to his family home in Alaska for the weekend and keep up the lie – but while it is cold outside, will Margaret begin to warm to this very different life and to the idea of being with Andrew? Hmmmm, I wonder – well, however it turns out I imagine there will be no end of comic misunderstandings along the way.Yep, it goes just where you expect it to and in terms of how it gets there it goes through all the sort of scenes, misunderstandings and 'gradual warming' stuff that you know it has to do. Having absolutely no problem with genre films doing what genre films do and also being someone who likes Sandra Bullock, I had no problem with this film being the way it was in terms of obvious structure and predictable narrative flow. What I did have a problem with was that it didn't actually do much to make it a good film. The most glaring problem with it is that as a romance it just doesn't work. It seems to expect the viewer to just accept that Margaret and Andrew have fallen for each other and that both have undergone some degree of character change during the film because it certainly doesn't show us it happening in any way that is obvious. OK we have the 'cocked head soft/sad look' scenes flash up occasionally (to imply Margaret's 'true heart' coming out) but otherwise nothing.This isn't helped by the film simply not funny enough as a comedy. OK there are some bits that show imagination and are funny but equally there are bits that just don't work. The forest chant/dance is embarrassing, seems dropped in out of nowhere and isn't that funny. It doesn't flow particularly well either, so the film doesn't have any sort of build – the funny scenes seem to stand on their own without leading anywhere or being used to strengthen other parts of the film. I laughed several times and chuckled a few more but mostly it just didn't seem like it was particularly well structured as a romantic comedy. It is a shame because Bullock is good in it while she plays against type. She is a good comic actress and I have no problem seeing her work in the genre where her looks and sweet personae make her charming, but it would be nice if she had more to work with than this. Reynolds is OK but cannot get much in the way of chemistry going with her and he is certainly not her equal in terms of the comedy. Steenburgen and Nelson are solid while White tends to scene-steal with some funny moments, although personally I thought she also had her share of moments that didn't work either – moments that seemed to just rely on her being an old woman in situations where one does not expect to see old women. Small turns from Nunez and Mandvi are good though and the film could have benefited from more colour in these smaller moments.The Proposal is not a bad film by any means. The plot comes with genre territory so should not be dismissed for that alone, but the problems come with the failure to flesh the film out around these standards into a good film. It is sporadically funny but never manages to build or even sustain this, while the lack of chemistry between the lead two characters is part of the reason that the relationship that develops never seem real and never convinced me enough to care about it. A basic genre film that might just have enough about it to please those looking for a basic genre film, but those hoping that it can build on the standards and be funny and charming will be disappointed to find that it falls short in both those areas.",Null,2,5,9 November 2009
Hustle & Flow," Great performance in the lead but the material isn't all that it needs to be and slips away totally at the end (minor spoilers)
","DJay is a smalltime pimp, selling his one or two worn girls out of his battered Cadillac or seedy strip-joints. However time has worn his enthusiasm for the game and he longs for more. Meeting up with an old classmate who has recording experience, DJay sees the opportunity to take his experience and use it to make his dreams come true through hip-hop. His aspirations cannot get him away from the reality of his situation but the impending visit of local rapper-made-good Skinny Black could be the break he needs.It is not possible to talk about this film without focusing on the person that really puts it all on his back and carries it from start to finish  Terrence Howard. Never someone who has impressed me, Howard did well in a small role in Crash and has improved again to produce a convincing central performance here. DJay could have been a big cliché played by a rapper that deeply enjoys the credibility of the pimp role but in Howard's hands the role is much closer to being a real person. He doesn't enjoy the pimp life so much as convincingly mire himself in it  his eyes are filled with an anger and pain that say more about the person than a thousand Jay-Z songs ever will. His character is key to the film and it is Howard that makes this part work.The rest of the film is more or less worthy of him but loses its way right at the end. For the majority we are allowed to act as witnesses without sides in his story  we aren't pushed to see him as a good man or a bad man, nor to allow the fact he might be 'good deep down' to excuse his violent exploitation of women. It is a fine line but the film balances it well. This success helps to make the plot more interesting considering that it is only ever a note away from being just one big 'making it out the hood' movie. The scenes of hip-hop hope are a bit cheesy but they are well balanced out by the sleazy and unglamorous reality of the lifestyle. It could have been deeper and more about the characters but it is still interesting enough to do well  up to a point.Unfortunately this point is about 20 minutes before the end of the film when suddenly Brewer abandons his approach and falls back on cliché, easy options and, worst of all, an optimistic ending that sees him holding DJay up in a way that he had mostly manage to avoid doing. The whole end flies in the face of what had gone before and throws off the balancing act it had done up till that point. It is a shame because it should have been more downbeat and interesting but instead it takes the line of least resistance. It may have been Brewer but, in his defence, it does smell slightly like the work of a studio executive or an American test audience. It still just about works although not even Howard can cover the disappointing in the final act.The rest of the cast do well to help him. Usually Anderson is enough to make me avoid a film but, as with the most recent series of The Shield, he shows that he can act and has a solid serious side. He is good and surprisingly unshowy support for Howard. Manning is good as Nola but again the end of the film sees her betrayed and asked to be something she is not. The vulnerable and pregnant Shug is really well delivered by Henson; her character may be simple on paper but she does well to be really quite touching and sympathetic. Parker has a black cliché in her finger-clicking, swearing performance but she is good enough to do the job without dragging the rest down a notch. Ludicrous (who also impressed me in Crash) is pretty close to his rapping personae in an easy role but he deserves credit for taking a beating on screen and being convincing in his one role. Hayes is a bit distracting in such a small role but again is a nice addition.Overall this is a pretty good film that pulls off the balancing act and avoids judgement for the majority, helped in no small way by a very strong turn from Howard. However at the end it undoes all this god work with an ending that is so easy and pat that I genuinely doubted it had been delivered by the same person who had written and directed the first two-thirds. Close to cliché and corn at times but it mostly mixes them well and the film is worth seeing.",Null,5,9,21 November 2005
The Birds," Dated effects but chilling and great fun is to be had with the subtexts
","Melanie Daniels meets Mitch Brenner at a pet shop where he has come to buy some birds for his young sister.  They have a conflict of words but he sparks her interest and she travels up to his small town to see him again. Daniels stays in the town for the weekend despite the tension between her and Brenner's mother.  However this is not the only source of worry as the locals begin to notice that the birds are acting out of character and showing signs of aggression.I came to this film because my mother mentioned she was scared of birds as a result of seeing this when she was young.  So I went for it with highs hopes that were not disappointed on the whole.  The basic plot is just that  basic.  But it allows plenty of disturbing scenes of bird attack as well as a nice slow build.  The effects have dated and it doesn't look as impressive now, but it still has an impact.  More importantly the film has a rich side-plot about themes that carry over from Psycho about mother's and sons. Not quite as far out as that film, this still has plenty of meat for anyone looking to analyse it further.Hedren is OK in the lead but I found her to be just giving the same performance as every `dangerous blonde' does in Hitchcock films.  But she is the predator of the film and she does it pretty well.  Taylor is a good stock B movie actor type but looking at him I couldn't help picturing Cary Grant doing the role and it took away from Taylor.  Tandy looked old even then, but she does really well with a complex role of the mother.  Pleshette is a little annoying but still okMost people see this as a horror film, but it is much more than that.  The ending is quite low key but it worked well with the overall feeling of menace in the birds, but it's worth remembering that this is not the ending Hitchcock wanted.  His first choice, the Golden Gate bridge covered in birds, couldn't be done due to a tight budget.Overall this is a great bit of Hitchcock that works on several levels.  The horror will have you sweating when walking through groups of pigeons in city centres and the subtext will keep you in the pub for several hours.",Null,11,22,5 December 2002
Princess Mononoke," Not perfect but still wonderful
","When he is touching by a demon while defending his village, Ashitaka is sent out to the West, from where the crazed demon originated, seeking a cure for the demon infection that will otherwise kill him.  However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Town's iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of it's trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that.  This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness.  The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai).  However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away.  The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it.  The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying.  I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters.  However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka.  Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her.  Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast.  Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast.  I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast.  Driver is OK but her character wasn't.  Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work.  Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added).  Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai.  Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki.  It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is!  It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids' animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of it's weaknesses.  The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices aren't that good.  The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story.  Despite this, it is still a wonderful film and easily one of the best animations I have seen.",Null,30,63,20 January 2004
Cinderella Man," You've seen it before but it is still professionally effective
","Once a young, promising boxer injury and back luck has seen Jim Braddock turn in one poor fight after another to the point where he is stripped of his boxing license and forced to looked for other work to support his wife and young children. This career change comes just as the country enters an economic depression and, like the rest of the country Jim and his family struggle to get by. Eventually he is forced to swallow his pride and start collecting welfare to get by. An injury to another fighter ahead of a big night gives Jim one last payday as his agent manages to talk the commission into letting him back due as nobody else will do it at short notice. Jim takes the fight for the money but knows that a win could start him back again  but he has no idea how important this fight is for more than just him.People on this site are praising this film and also wondering why it 'flopped' (which is arguable but I'll let it stand) but to me it is perfectly understandable because the film is nothing wonderfully brilliant and is very much a package deal that perhaps people weren't in the mood for. I'm not sure if it is the presence of Crowe, Zellweger or what but here we are. What I mean by a 'package deal' is that this is another one of those sports movies that follows the 'against all odds' rise of the 'little fella' when the rise takes on significant to the community/country. The obvious parallel is Seabiscuit and in a way Cinderella Man does the same thing in the same sort of way. So the sense of period is done really well through costumes and sets, the cast has big names, the big sporting events (in this case the fights) are done with a touch of slow-motion and, as the crowd rises, so does the music; whether you like it not, when they are done right they are very good at sweeping you up in the feelings.Cinderella Man is no exception and it does it all with a professional polish and grand sweep. The details of the story are different but essentially it is the same film and unlikely to be considered 'great' on its own terms  because it doesn't really have any. That said, it is another good film in this mould and by the end, when the music came up at the end, of course I was into it. Crowe does well to hold back his usual arrogance to be quite a polite figurehead for the film and makes it easy for you to get behind his character even if you don't like him as a person. Zellweger doesn't quite manage the same feat though, and her pained look and trademark whine was quite annoying to me and I didn't like her performance. Giamatti embraces the trainer cliché and makes it work for him while support from Considine, McGill and others help round out a starry cast. Howard directs with a sturdy hand, doing well with the fight scenes in particular; it isn't all down to him but I did think he let the sweeping meaning of the final fight get away with him a little bit but to be honest by then I was swept up in it myself.Cinderella Man is nothing new or remarkable but it is still an easily enjoyable and warming sports movie in the mould of Seabiscuit and the like.",Null,4,6,11 September 2008
Jurassic Park," Big dumb fun that relies on special effects to cover the gaps (Jaws with claws)
","Wealthy businessman Hammond has developed a process for recreating dinosaurs from DNA held inside insects encased in amber.  He uses it to create an island theme park, Jurassic Park, to cash in on the spectacle.  Hammond invites a select group to visit the island under tour conditions - his lawyer, a mathematician, his grandchildren and two archeologists.  However during the tour the man in charge of the computer system shuts down the fences so he can smuggle out stolen dinosaur embryos to sell to the higher bidder.  With the fences down the dinosaurs escape their compounds and the visiting group find themselves with a much closer view than they expected.Adapted from Michael Crichton's novel, this is basically a summer blockbuster that relies on special effects to cover the holes in the plot. The story is a little daft from the very start however once you get past the first 30 minutes of science you get to the dinosaurs and Spielberg's set pieces and nothing else really matters.  The effects are good and the action is well handled by the master director himself.  The film has plenty of suspense and drama - especially when the raptors break free!  However the film also has plenty of problems that come out when you look past the spectacle.Firstly the kids!  Why does Spielberg always feel that he's got to put cute kids in every film - just cause it worked with ET doesn't mean it'll come off every time.  They both quickly become annoying and I wished that they would just move that little bit slower so something could get them.  The film also wants to be a family blockbuster and it doesn't want to upset the audience, hence several main characters that die in the book live in the film so as not to upset sequels etc.  The other main weakness is the huge merchandising that came with the film, making it feel like a happy meal package rather than a film.  However outside of all this baggage the film moves quickly and contains plenty of good action scenes that more than cover the other weaknesses.Neill is OK as Dr Grant and he is clearly happy to get involved in a franchised blockbuster.  Laura Dern is not as good - she is far too hammy and isn't convincing in  her emotion.  Goldblum is excellent as the chaos-therorising mathematician, but it's his usual stuttering scientist stuff so he doesn't have to try too hard.  The rest of the cast are quality, even if they are only to be dinosaur fodder.  Jackson,, Peck, Wayne Knight and of course, Attenborough.  However those children - who seem to have most of the screen time really should have been better.Overall this is a good summer blockbuster - the effects and the action scenes are big and exciting.  However the plot is weak, the performances mainly poor - without these major flaws it cannot be as good as it should have been.",Null,5,13,8 February 2002
Valkyrie," Solidly engaging thriller that works despite knowing the outcome before you start
","I'm not really a fan of Tom Cruise so I let this film go past me until it came to TV because I just thought it screamed 'star vehicle' too loudly. In reality I was probably a bit too hasty with that call because Valkyrie is a solid little film that delivers an interesting story with the predictable Hollywood liberty but does so in a rather satisfying manner. Having decided to put my personal feelings on Cruise to one side, I did still think that the film would struggle because ultimately I already knew the ending (spoiler: the plot to assassinate Hitler isn't successful) and it would therefore not be able to hook me in. I think in a way this was correct but not really in the way that I thought.In terms of just straight up narrative flow the film does engage; OK it maybe takes a while to establish the main players and get things moving forward but ultimately, while I knew they would fail, I was interested to see what happens, how it happens and what they did. On this level I enjoyed the film and although it was a full two hours long I wasn't bored by it and it felt like it was as long as it should have been. Where I thought it didn't quite pull it off is in the portrayal of why the conspirators felt they had to act. In this regard I didn't feel their desperation and I didn't get a tangible sense of how bad things were at this point in the war for Germany; I know from other films etc how bad things were but this film didn't really do that so much as simply say that things were bad. Likewise I didn't get a feel for the emotions behind the plot and instead I got the impression that the film was taking it as read that everyone dislikes Hitler and therefore that would be all the understanding we would need – this is perhaps partly true but the film needed this as part of it, not an external thing brought by modern audiences.Singer does a really good job in terms of direction. There isn't a huge amount of action here but the tension is good and it is very well delivered to be a lot more effective than I thought it would be (again, the issue over knowing the ending). The cast is deep in quality but, like me, many will get stuck at Cruise. He does an OK job by which I mean he doesn't overplay or make it all about him the personality. The downside of this is that he doesn't bring much character out either and I didn't see much of a person in his character – he does have presence though, which helps a lot. The supporting cast is rich and their presence also helps the film since you cannot turn left or right without bumping into a quality British actor. Branagh, Nighy, Wilkinson, Stamp, Izzard, Hollander and so on – they all do solid work and are a boon to the film.Valkyrie isn't a classic by any means but nor is it the ego-driven Cruise film I expected. Instead it is a solidly entertaining thriller based on fact that manages to engage even though you know the outcome. Cruise doesn't get in the way and the support cast make it stronger by their quality and their number.",Null,28,31,24 May 2011
The Simpsons Movie," Enjoyable even if it falls far short of the series at its best
","Homer takes a pig into the family but, as much as it amuses him, it messes up the house and makes Bart feel even more isolated from his father. Meanwhile Lisa finds a soul-mate in her quest to educate the community in local environmental matters. However when Homer finds that his pig excrement problem is getting out of control, he dumps the silo in the lake  triggering an environmental catastrophe. On the orders of President Schwarzenegger, EPA director Russ Cargill seals Springfield in a plastic dome. Resources naturally run low and the town yet again turns on Homer and the Simpsons.Out of a summer of mostly mediocre sequels and franchise movies, The Simpsons stood out as the one that many audiences were waiting for the most. I know I went on a weekend night (and I hate crowds  particularly noisy multiplex crowds) in my desire to see it. The film itself though, doesn't really live up to the expectation and, although funny, does come across like the faltering first steps of a baby  at times moving quickly but mostly looking like it is about to fall over at any moment. Part of the reason for this is probably that the bar is set too high  something that it did for itself. Of course being a brilliant TV series is hardly a criticism but it does work against the film, particularly as it struggles to fit into the 90 minute format.It isn't so much the matter of having enough plot to fill it, because the Simpsons has always jumped around quickly  using one event to lead to another and then another. However doing it across this length of time is not quite the same. Strangely though it wasn't this I had the problem with, it was the way the film format meant that it did have to have more of a 'narrative' feel to it with more talking and plot development. The problem with this is that it is such foreign territory that it stands out  it jars with the funny moments (of which there are plenty) and I found myself wanting more of the latter and slightly put off by the former. It is not that the plot is bad, but just it breaks up the normal tight and fast pace that I am used to with the episodes and I missed this.Is it funny though? Well, yes, it is but just not as funny as the many, many brilliant episodes that I enjoy. It is rarely as smart and witty as the TV series. The style of humour is typical but at times it is a bit obvious and not as out and out clever as I would have hoped for  again perhaps a problem associated with the bar being set high by expectations from the TV series. This is not to say that it isn't funny because there are still plenty of great moments and lines but they don't merge into a great flow  rather they are asides from the main plot. In a way the attempt to have more of a 'story' with character threads mean that there is less time for the quickfire material and it shows in the way that many characters are limited in their screen time. Of particular disappointment is Mr Burns being limited to just one scene  albeit one of the best of the film, complete with the most typically Simpsons line 'ah, for once the rich, white man is in control'. The voice cast are all great, despite some of the many, many characters having little to do; while guest stars are wisely limited to Green Day and Tom Hanks.Overall then, it is a very funny and enjoyable movie that is fun despite the fact that it never really finds a consistent pace or flow. Fans will enjoy it as much as they are disappointed perhaps but it is still a good film that is one of the best films from a mostly lacklustre summer offering thus far.",Null,6,10,13 August 2007
Alien: Covenant," Sits awkwardly across two stools, being good enough to work, but not excelling at either (suggestive SPOILERS)
","It is a testament to the alien itself that the franchise continues, and that it continues to interest and engage. Even as the franchise has become messier as it expands, the core strengths remain – although this does depend on who you speak to. Prometheus does seem to have pleased those who were happy that the 'horror' element of the franchise was put behind the expansion of the story and mythology of the alien as a creature, and Covenant seems to be trying to keep that element while also producing an 'Alien' movie in terms of what that mostly has meant. It is a flawed attempt, but yet still provides enough of value to enjoy.On the horror side, there are plenty of creatures, tension, fast- movement, and intensity; but it does all have the downside of feeling overly familiar. It doesn't help itself by having sequences which are directly or indirectly referencing the original films, but not quite doing it as effectively. For instance, the shower scene here is not bad, but when placed against the horrific cruelty and sexual nature of a similar scene in the original, it pales. Similarly, the other scenes deliver, but yet still fall short of something which we are constantly reminded of. The creatures themselves retain power, and the characters are decent enough to make us invest, and it is all professionally delivered.On the other side, the mythology is more fully explained in terms of the development of the creature we are familiar with, the motivations of David and, by extension, of the Engineers. The problem is that there is a lot of true horror and character in there that needed to be brought out more than it was. The horror/thriller aspect takes time from that element, and I wanted to be more shocked or chilled by David than I was – too often the events were related as such, as opposed to having a depth to them. Again this element did still work, but I was left wanting more given what it did. Fassbender helps this element loads though, and his performance makes the most of the time allotted for this, although on the flipside it does frustrate as I wanted more.The plot itself, outside of these elements, does better at creating characters we like, or that have interesting flaws; but Covenant relies on them being stupid, and taking bad decisions with no basis – mainly to allow the plot to move. There is enough to the film to make that less annoying, but it is still annoying to see heavily armed with guns but yet apparently oblivious to disease or microbiological risks associated with stepping onto a new planet. That aside though, there is enough in the horror, and in the mythology, and in Fassbender, to make Covenant worth seeing, even if it doesn't deliver on its full potential.",Null,0,5,13 August 2017
All the President's Men," An engaging political drama that delivers in a slow, wordy film
","When the police are called to a suspected break in at the headquarters of the Democratic party, they arrest 5 burglars.  At the court hearing, one of the men states his occupation as security consultant with past links to the CIA, sparking the interest of journalist Bob Woodward.  When he later learns that two of the men had `Howard Hunt at W. House' in their address books, he begins to dig.  As the story opens up with secret sources and leads, the paper puts Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the story full time but continue to hold back from printing things lacking proof. However as they investigate they find the story spreading wider and higher than they could have imagined.I have tried to watch this film several times in the past few years, but it has always been on late at night and my lack of vhs meant I fell asleep both times trying to watch it.  With it on this week I was now able to video it and watch it at a reasonable hour.  The film has always intrigued me as it is a part of history I know very little about other than the basics - not only was it just before my lifetime, but I was born into a country where my own politics were more important.  I am, however, aware enough not to treat every word of this film as the truth without questions - so when watching it I tried to focus on the bigger facts and assume that the detail in the film was either fictionalised to make it flow better or characters were combined for the sake of clarity.  These assumptions were not a real problem for me as I wasn't really looking to this film for a history lesson.What I was after was a solid political thriller, and that is what I got. The film starts simply and builds up to reveal an entire web of conspiracy; it does it well and I never got lost in the sea of names and links - it's running time is generous but it is well filled, never feeling over simplified or rushed.  The film may well bore audiences, but not if they are able to follow along with it's telling.  I found it gripping even though I knew where their trail would lead them and what the repercussions would be. This is a real credit to the film - we all know roughly what happened and who was involved yet it is still thrilling.Director Pakula does well to condition the audience into right/wrong mindsets.  The newspaper offices are bastions of light and space - the place where truth is everything and there are no secrets.  On the flipside of this, the corridors of power are shady and claustrophobic; informants are met in dark car parks where light barely reaches - the truth has little place and just enough comes out to illuminate the scene.  It gives the film a little bit of an over simplified view of the situation but it is effective.The cast is very deep and roundly good.  It is hard to imagine the impact of two massive stars in the lead of this film - watching it now it is easy to accept Newman and Hoffman in the leads but they were a hot casting then and really still would be now!  Newman is given the lion's share of the material as he is easily the more photogenic; Hoffman is still given plenty to do but he seems to have the less glamorous side of things and is portrayed as less heroic - I'm not sure if that was deliberate casting choices or just the way the script played out.  The support cast is deep in famous names - I don't know how many were famous then but certainly a surprising amount of them are still well known faces.  Warden, Holbrook, Beatty, Robards and a small role for Abraham are the better roles but everyone plays their parts and I honestly couldn't remember a weak link in the chain.Overall this film manages to be a solid political thriller even though we all know the outcome - but it is less about where it ends than how it gets there (the final revelations are told quickly via typewriter).  As a journey it works really well and is involving and gripping.  Stands up after all these years.",Null,1,5,13 March 2004
Draft Day," A solid movie which has a good cast and delivery to make it more than it is – still only decent, but everyone puts their back into it
","This is a sports movie in the tradition of the films that Kevin Costner used to make when he was great – Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup; all films that blend aspects of sport into characters and relationship drama. This is not to say that Draft Day deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those films, but just to mention that Costner is on home ground here. The plot centers around the piece of socialism which is Draft Day – where essentially the worst teams in the league get first pick of new players, but of course with lots of horse trading and deals done all around this system. So, basically a sports film about contracts and rosters – not on-field action.Despite this it works well because it recognizes the drama of the day, with fans eagerly awaiting to see who their new star player will be – teams are made, as are young athlete millionaires. The film balances this well and has good forward motion; I mean, these are fictional players in a fictional draft but the drama of the trading is well done and you do tend to get drawn into it and enjoy the twists and the tension (even if you know generally that it will probably end well for those we are following). The split-screen conversations and the movement of the camera and the use of realistic sets and TV talking heads, all add to the feeling of realism and I enjoyed this aspect of it.What doesn't work so well is the film trying to take this drama and fold in some personal drama in the way that the aforementioned films did so well. In this case it doesn't really convince and feels like it is part of the film because it has to be, rather than it genuinely being part of this character's day. This is a shame because it takes up the time, so why not make it work just as well as the main drama? Either way, it doesn't – it is not awful but it doesn't work. This is a shame for Garner in particular, but her male counterparts eat up the drama of the draft – with Costner leading the way well with this slow drawl adding a calm urgency and loads of starry supporting actors giving the feeling of quality and depth.It isn't anything remarkable or special, but it is a perfectly decent sports film with an enjoyable sense of tension. Shame the human stuff doesn't work, but for those of us that enjoy listening to the drama of the last day of the transfer window on Radio Five Live (even though our teams are not involved) then this film catches that pretty well.",Null,0,0,14 November 2014
The Soloist," A solid and engaging film in the main that only hurts itself when it does give way to sentimentality (although this is not too often)
","When it came out in the UK (which was sometime after it came out in the US) there was still some lingering talk of Oscars which is sort of par for the course in any film where a famous actor is playing a character with a mental illness etc. As it transpired, the film wasn't there when the names were called and in some areas (acting) I think that is a shame because while the film has its problems it is actually a very engaging piece. The plot follows a journalist (Steve Lopez) as he finds a homeless man (Nathaniel Ayers) playing violin on the street with a skill far in excess of that which his appearance would suggest him capable of. As he tries to help this man and get a story out of it, Lopez finds out more about the plight of the homeless in LA.The film never quite becomes as smug and curt as my potted plot summary makes it sound but I will say that there is an atmosphere of hand-wringing to the film that it never totally loses – it is not overpowering but it is in the air and you never forget it is there for very long. This manifests itself in the nature of the telling as we very much have Lopez as the main character but it also comes from the unnecessary excesses when it comes to the wider issues of homelessness. This is most evident in the terrible clips over the end credits (talk about overegging the cake) but it is also in the main film when it goes all hand-wringing over 'what's to be done' and also visually and audibly gushes over the healing power of music. It is a shame because otherwise the film does maintain a fairly even keel and manages something close to restraint, particularly when the scenes are squarely in the hands of the lead two actors – scenes where director Wright actually does well to be as matter-of-fact as he is.Ignoring the liberties taken with the fact (which will not even occur to most casual viewers – myself included) we actually have a very solid story in this odd relationship. The characters are not excessively polished and nor are the performances pushed out in the hope of an award. Credit to Jamie Foxx because this is the sort of thing where it could all be played out over soft music and where there could have been several 'big' scenes where the Oscar clip is in the mind. On the contrary, Foxx is restrained and convincing and you feel for his character all the more for it, he doesn't have one 'big' scene where everything is laid out but both he and the film are better for it. Downey benefits from the material not leaving Lopez as either a blank plot device or as some sort of saint, rather his motives are always questionable and his ability to do anything is not exaggerated. This gives Downey more to play with and he does very well with it – again he is never showy or give 'one big moment' but he is consistently good and he works very well with Foxx. Keener has a small role without too much to do (but still manages to be a quality presence as ever) while Hollander and Hamilton are both good but also rather odd finds for viewers of The Thick of It and True Blood respectively.Overall The Soloist ironically may have been more successful had it really turned up the sentimental music and gone the whole weepy route, but it would have been a lesser film. As it is, it is not perfect and does give way to sweeping generalisations and slight sentimentality when it comes to the music and the wider issues, but in the main story it is sturdy, reliable and quite emotionally balanced. It is also helped a great deal that both Foxx and Downey are happy with this approach and pitch their engaging performances accordingly. Not a brilliant film but certainly one worth seeing.",Null,1,2,17 February 2010
Dodgeball," Very silly but fun despite the odd patch of misses
","Peter La Fleur runs a second rate gym that is populated by non-paying members who are, shall we say, on the edge of society. Peter's relaxed existence is made difficult by the fact that a large gym across the road aims to shut him down. When the Average Joe gym receives its final warning from the bank, they face a 30-day deadline to come up with $50,000 or lose the gym to competitor White Goodman. After their initial ideas fail, they discover that the national dodgeball contest has a prize of that very amount  with a little help from an ex-champion, they set out to make it to the finals and save the day.This film came to the UK on a wave of hype and praise but I was a little wary because I knew that the style of humour that it has can be very hit and miss. The film has the same plot that all these sorts of sports movies have and you pretty much know where it is going from the very start but, to be honest, how many people have come here for the engaging story? No  me neither! The humour is very silly and it will not appeal to everyone but I found it pretty funny with the out-of-the-blue stuff being the funniest; if you find it funny to hear the line 'thank you Chuck Norris' said with sincerity then this will be the film for you. It isn't as consistent as I would have liked because it does have a couple of patches where there are more misses than hits but generally I had a good hatful of laughs and, when not laughing I still had a smile on my face.Of course, like I said, this isn't for everybody and I'm sure many will see it as a juvenile  and it does seem to have been aimed at the young male side of the market. The downside of this is that the majority of the laughs are pretty basic and, as we are seeing too often recently, the old audience draw of girls kissing is wheeled out yet again. The casting also helps to a certain degree and do help a bit to cover the basic humour. Vaughn is cool and relaxed and, although you wouldn't call it 'acting' he is a likable lead. Stiller has a few dry moments but generally his 70's fitness freak steals every scene he is in. Taylor is pretty but you can't help feeling that the film is only using her when, for no reason other than titillation she is revealed as bisexual (with a girlfriend). Torn is funny if basic and Azaria is also funny. The support cast is more about off the wall characters than good writing or performances, but Long, Root, Moore, Tudyk and others are all OK. Cameos from Hasselhoff, Norris, Shatner and Lance Armstrong are all briefly amusing and, just like Best in Show, commentators Gary Cole and Jason Bateman do spot on spoofs of low-grade sports commentators and have lots of great lines between them.Overall this is not the funniest film EVER, as some critics have absurdly claimed  it simply isn't consistent enough for that accolade but it is still a pretty funny film if you are in the mood for silly humour and some pretty basic jokes. The use of easy draws such as female flesh, lesbianism and physical jokes is a bit of a downer when you think about it but I doubt many will complain when it is on. The cast generally do well and the material is funny and energetic enough to do the job, producing a silly film that is hardly memorable but will be fun while you're watching it.",Null,64,94,23 August 2004
The Martian," Entertaining and slick enough to make you go with it
","I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair – an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun – with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it – although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years).The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion – essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable – Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Peña, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks.In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself.",Null,26,31,2 July 2016
The Fighter," Just a great piece of story telling
","I have been burnt so many times around Oscar time of year – films that come out with a lot of fanfare and glory, films that seem very 'worthy' but ones that ultimately don't deliver on the screen where it matters. Daniel Craig's Defiance comes to mind but there have been others. Anyway, for this reason I stayed out of the crowds for The Fighter and only got round to watching it recently. I was very pleased to find that, although not a classic, The Fighter is just a solidly great film that satisfies across the board even if it isn't the classic that some would have you believe.The plot comes from a true story and is as much about the character as it is about the sport. While the fights produce the type of energy and drama that we are used to with Hollywood sports movie it is the relationships that provide the bulk of the film and draw the viewer into the story and caring about the characters. Although some liberties are taken with facts (the final fight was in the UK, not in the US) and I'm sure the characters have been handled the same way but yet they still really engage. The family background is made up of a strong willed women and a bunch of big-haired, small-town daughters that look like snakes on the head of their mother Medusa; it is very well done and it is such a strong part of the film. The brother's battle with drugs moves along the main sporting plot really well, complimenting and working with it. Meanwhile of course the rise from nothing to having a chance to be champion is the reason we all watch sport – everyone loves the underdog.The story could have been badly told or a little corny but the delivery is strong and it helps that the cast are roundly great. Although the others get the awards, it is Wahlberg that does some of the finest work. He doesn't have the mannerisms, he doesn't have the bigger character so he understates it and allows the others to work, thus being the foundation for them to be effective. Bale is tremendous; watching action blockbusters where his voice is comically deep makes you forget that he is essentially a brilliant actor. His Dicky is very real and very well drawn physically and mentally. Although Melissa Leo almost blew it with those ridiculous adverts, her performance is strong enough t overcome those for the Oscar and she does well here. Her monstrous but also well-meaning mother is great. Adams plays very much the level below these but she is still very good while the supporting cast all play their parts convincingly throughout.The Fighter is not a perfect film but it is a really great one. The sporting drama is complimented by the character drama and these two elements are all made to work thanks to strong direction, writing and of course a collection of actors who deserve every good thing said about them in this film. Ignore all the hype and awards though, just come to it as a film and I'm sure you'll be impressed by just what a roundly strong piece of story-telling it all is.",Null,4,6,5 June 2011
Evil Dead II," A rerun it may be but it is still an unsettling, funny and enjoyable rerun thanks again to Raimi and Campbell
","Having lost his girlfriend to the undead, Ash is forced to face the possessed corpse of his former lover Linda and cut her up with a chainsaw to stop him becoming her victim. However the demons in the cabin are not that easy to stop and soon his hand has become possessed as well. While he battles to stop his hand killing him, a group of four young people are heading to the cabin in seek of shelter for the night, only to find themselves trapped in the same fight as Ash as barely managed to survive thus far.Despite that fact that Sam Raimi is now a 'proper' director making summer blockbusters like his life depended on it, it is still heartening to see that his frenzied style is still present in his work, albeit it not dealing with such extreme material as that which made his name famous decades ago. While Evil Dead II may be a complete repeat of Evil Dead in terms of the basic narrative and content, it is still worth seeing because of Raimi's skill as director and writer of the film. In the UK Evil Dead earned notoriety for being one of the 'video nasties' that the BBFC took such objection to and, in doing so, probably greatly boosted its cult appeal here, and to rerun this film is not a major problem because it does have enough energy and good qualities going for it to be worth a watch if you're into your horror.However horror fans may find it a little tame by modern standards although I still found it to be pretty scary and gory  certainly considering it was made almost 20 years ago with a budget that would barely buy you an A-listed movie star these days. The film is also pretty funny and is full of dark humour and comic moments that make it more entertaining than a gory b-movie has any right being. But here's the thing, the success of this film and indeed the whole trilogy, is mainly due to two people  Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Raimi drives everything with his unique direction that places the action somewhere between a horror and a cartoon. It has great camera work, frantic shots and a real flair for the unreal; it is very hard to describe but it can be seen it many of his films.Campbell's ongoing cult status has only been helped recently by Bubba Ho-tep but this is where it basically began and part II only sees his continue his good work as Ash becomes more of a hero than he was in the first film. He still has the cowardly quality that I loved in Ash but now has weapons and kiss-off lines to compliment his new status. As before his performance perfectly matches Raimi's direction and I can totally understand why the two have kept their close relationship decades later  they really seem to 'get' each other here. Support from Berry, Hicks, DePaiva, Domeier and Bixler is just about passable for this type of b-movie stuff but really the cast is dominated by Campbell playing his best character to date.Overall this is a gory, cheap horror movie that won't appeal to everybody but to those that get it, it will be a hugely enjoyable, gory film with a great sense of humour. Director Raimi and actor Campbell truly make the film work better than the material would suggest it should and, on the basis of any of the three films, it is no wonder that this is such a timeless cult horror.",Null,38,48,13 February 2005
High Fidelity," Oh great! They've got me down pat
","Rob is the owner of a small record store who spends his time arguing over record lists with his two hapless employees.  When his relationship hits a bad patch and breaks up, lending Rob to re-examine his life through his top five break-ups while trying to salvage what he can and start his adult life.`They're setting a Nick Hornby book in America!?'.  How would Fever Pitch have played out if it had been based around American Football and not the Arsenal?  Happily there is one thing different with this book  and that's the fact that the book is about me  it's about men.  And this subject is the same in the UK and the US.  As a result the film is as good as the book because the character and the situation is so very real.  Rob's life may not be a copy of everyone's details but the basic character is so recognisable. A guy who lists everything, is a geek for detail and screws up relationship because he isn't ready to grow up.If you can recognise yourself then you'll love this movie.  I saw myself and the film meant more to me as a result.  Despite this it is very funny and yet quite touching.  Rob's to-camera delivery works very well and really helps get into the film with minimum work.  It may be a film (hence we have the constant soundtrack and the gorgeous girls that we don't have) but the meaning is the same.Cusack became one of my favourite working actors with this film even if some of his stuff is mixed.  Here he is the typical man and it's a role he carries without overdoing any of it or without mocking himself.  Black and Louiso are the comedy duo who overdo it to great effect.  They are lesser characters but really help the film. The `girlfriends' are all excellent and a mix of faces  Hjejle is good while Jones, Taylor, Gilbert etc are very funny.  Oh, and Bonet is `oh my God' sexyOverall this is a great film if you can relate to the central character.  If you can't then you might enjoy the comedy and the story but you won't take as much from it.  I hated Rob because his petty listing and bickering reminded me of myself but it was a good ride nonetheless.  Funny and insightful  all men should watch it rather than arguing over the top five movies which feature male flaws.",Null,6,11,27 January 2003
Up in the Air," Subverts the genre a little with a sharp edge to be enjoyable but not worthy of the mass praise it got at the time (MASSIVE SPOILERS)
","I don't remember if it won anything or even what categories it was getting buzz for, but I do recall that when Up in The Air came out the film was highly considered awards-material and there were lots of reviews gushing about how timely it was in regards its subject matter. Not sure why it took me several years to watch it, but it did. What I found was a perfectly likable little indie comedy/drama that delivers a rather traditional message but does it in a way that slightly subverts the genre. The theme of redundancies is not really as important as many reviewers claimed, but it also sort of props up the traditional message.The way these films usually work is that we follow our main character through a life of glossy awesomeness and then join them in a sort of self-discovery where they realise that this superficial awesome life is, well, superficial. They usual then trade some of this awesome for a bit less superficiality – this is a revelation they normally make while running to the arms of the woman they could have treated a bit better while being awesome and superficial. This is normally how it works and this is basically what the film does and it does it more or less with the pacing and style of the genre. For this it should not be overly praised but rather just enjoyed because it does it pretty well – although it does what you expect. What helps it is that it does have this rather clear eye in the presentation and it is also a little harsh in tone; in particular, while our character makes the revelation and we are shown the importance of family – he doesn't get to benefit from it and he carries on the way he was, albeit with his enjoyment of the superficial awesomeness notably reduced because of how aware he is of the superficiality of it all.This is a nice touch and I felt it made the film better and complimented my impression of the rest of the story. In the telling we are given comedy and drama in a nicely wry mix and for all its genre stamps, I did really quite like the flow of it. Clooney is a massive part of this as he comes over so natural and human – so yes this is maybe something he does easily when it is early in the film, but he never comes over as smug and we still like him despite his job and thus we are with him when he equally convinces towards the end. He is well supported by Farmiga who is his plot device but is also as good as him. Kendrick is solid and it is nice to see Bateman, Simmons, McBride and Elliot in small roles.The theme of redundancies was made much of when the film came out because it supposedly captured the heart of the period or was searingly relevant or other such rhetoric but to me it did no such thing. The film doesn't really feel for the people and it certainly doesn't comment on their plight or feelings; it does allow them space at the end of the film, but this is only to allow the film to emphasize the point about the importance of roots and family – but this is a point that does not only apply to bad times, so for me it wasn't like this film was really hitting a moment in time – just that its plot device was topical, there is a difference.Up in the Air is a genre movie where our hero learns a life-lesson in regards the importance of family and reality in a life – it is a good example of this genre as it subverts it nicely and has a consistently good mix of comedy and drama. It isn't quite the amazing film that the critics at the time claimed, but it is still very good and Clooney is as good as he is well cast.",Null,2,4,11 February 2012
From Here to Eternity," Good melodrama but overrated
","1941.  Private `Prew' Prewitt has been transferred to Hawaii.  His new captain is keen to get promoted and sees Prew's former boxing prowess as his way to get noticed.  However Prew has given up boxing and refuses to join the team  leading the Captain to punish him in many different ways. Meanwhile Sergeant Warden is beginning an affair with the Captains maltreated wife.  Prew himself finds a girl but his friend Maggio has conflict with Sergeant Judson.  Meanwhile the threat of attack looms.This is most famous for Warden and Holmes' adulterous passion as the waves lash over them.  Probably people who haven't seen the film will still know that scene.  However this film is much more than that.  The plot has several main strands  mostly involving romance  running through it.  It works well but it is really a soapy melodrama at the end of it all.  This doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and intense but it is really that basic.  The Pearl Harbour attack is tacked onto the end and didn't really grab me.The central relationships are OK but the film is strongest in some very good male performances.  Clift is great as the put upon private, while Lancaster deserves recognition for more than just snogging Kerr on a beach.  Kerr and Reed are OK  Kerr is better but none of the female roles are as good as the male leads.  Warden, Sinatra and Borgnine are all great support and steal the show when they are on screen (Sinatra especially).Overall I was surprised to see this film being hailed so high in many polls. I found it to be involving, interesting and well acted but at it's core it is a melodrama that has a few bangs at the end.  Worth a watch.",Null,15,20,24 November 2002
Atonement," Professional and classy drama whose only significant weakness is the inability to deliver the emotional gutting that it should have been (MAJOR SPOILERS)
","As a thirteen year old girl, Briony Tallis has a passion and creativity that sees her channel her energy into writing novels and plays. Her upper class family live is happy and privileged. However a late night search for two of her young cousins who have gone off by themselves sees Briony stumble across her other young cousin being raped. Briony identifies the attacker as Robbie Turner, the young working class man taken in by her family who is also the new lover of elder sister Cecilia. In one night this accusation rips the family apart, shattering lives perhaps irreparably.I wasn't sure what to expect from Atonement, never having read the book or really knowing much about the story. As a result I found the film to be a rather sumptuous and engaging watch but yet at the same time to be quite unsatisfying in regards the emotional content which I imagine the book must do much better. I imagine this for the simple reason that the film alludes to it and that the book has significantly more time to deliver in this regard. The thing for me is, and I'll jump right into the spoilers here, the film didn't develop and engage me enough for the story to hurt and the ending to crush. I didn't long for Robbie and Cecilia as much as I should have done and as a result I found myself watching the story rather than feeling it. The emotional impact of the ending is undercut by this as well. Without the hurt or anger in the viewer at the news that any happiness in their lives was a complete fantasy comes as a twist more than a punch. The presentation of this twist is also not perfect because for me it came over like it was giving Briony a way of finding her own forgiveness. It is a false atonement though and one given to her by herself to the benefit of nobody else. This sense of pointlessness and loss is not followed through on though and instead we get another 'false' scene of happiness that seems to be suggesting that Briony has ultimately done the right thing; whereas I felt that she could never have atonement for what she did, whether I wanted her to or not.I might be reading too much into it but that was what I thought and I didn't think that the film delivered that well enough. That said, the story is still engaging and solid. The jumping around within time structure worked surprisingly well and it did hold my interest easily. What makes the film though is the delivery, which is classy and professional in almost all regards. The sets and costumes hit you first because it is very well located and framed; you can feel the heat and relaxed air of the meadow, the stiffness of the dining room and so on. It looks and feels perfect for period and place; some will feel that that the typically English stiffness is a barrier to the film but I did not. The soundtrack is worth noting as well as it builds in the typewriter sound so well that it is present but yet unobtrusive. Wright's direction is excellent and the many touches he employs makes this stand out from being another English period piece. I liked the fades to black in the backgrounds and some other character framing shots that did keep the literary feel. Of course the money shot is the one-take around the crowded beach  an impressive shot from a technical point of view and a real pleasure to watch.The cast is the final area of delivery and of course the running time of the film and the requirements to hook the audience put a lot of pressure on them. I felt that McAvoy stood up to this pressure well and delivers a convincing and heartfelt performance throughout, making me care for his character. Knightley is not as good but she is not Pirates of the Caribbean either. I never felt for her or the pain she carries but yet at other times she is good  the love scene being the most convincing (and another really well delivered scene as well). Ronan is the best of the Briony actresses. I thought that Garai didn't give much away (partly because she is having to play a character as written by that character) and Redgrave, although a strong presence, was treated too well by the film in my opinion.Overall though this is a really well made film that has class dripping from the stylish direction, the score, the set and the performances to name a few. The emotional impact is surprisingly not what it should have been and I thought that the ending was disappointingly touched with hope and forgiveness that I thought was ill-fitting.",Null,11,18,5 May 2008
V for Vendetta," A surprisingly effective social satire within a Hollywood film? It is not perfect but it is very enjoyable for what it does
","Evey Hammond is heading out after curfew when the Government's Finger Men catch her and decide to enact their own form of justice on her. Her only rescue comes in the form of a masked man in a cape. This man then proceeds to show her the destruction of the Old Bailey. The Government spring into action to spin the story, control the people and find the terrorist. The police track Evey from CCTV and head to her work place (the Government controlled television station) to detain her. 'V' arrives before them and uses the emergency station to broadcast his own message of unrest, elevating his 'terrorist' stance against the Government in a year long war that will culminate on the 5th November one way or the other.It probably helps to be in the UK to really appreciate what this film does well. I don't mean that in a snobby way but it is a success of the film that it produces a vision of the UK that is both futuristic but yet recognisable as our current condition. It does this most easily by visually mixing the design of homes and people's lives with all the trimmings of a totalitarian state but it also does it by making the links to our current political state of control and Government intrusion in the name of 'terrorism control' and protection. Although it is only a year old, the film still shows a lot of foresight when viewed with hindsight and in doing so it produces an effectively bleak attack on our current political climate. It is effective mainly because it doesn't ever feel that far fetched thanks to the details but mainly thanks to the overriding themes of fear and control being used by a Government.The surprise and joy of finding this level of social commentary in a what appeared to be a Hollywood action movie helped cover up some of the weaknesses. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action in the film; personally I do not see this as a weakness because this is more to do with how the film was sold rather than how it was made. The weaknesses are minor and include the asks the plot makes in regards the ability of V to do what he does and how far-fetched some of it is etc but, like I said, these are covered by how relevant and interesting I found the story. The cast are mostly good. It took me a good twenty minutes to accept Portman's accent but after that she won me over. She is very much in the shadow of Weaving, who shows what a great voice he has by producing a wonderful character without a glimpse of his face throughout. Rea is a bit dour but he does convince as a worn-down public servant faced with the truth about his masters. Fry wasn't that good but does what he had to do in a small role. Hurt and Pigott-Smith are both very good; Hurt particularly convinced as the sort of person who rises to power and delivered convincing lines in a convincing manner  it is telling he has little screen time but a large impact. McTeigue direction was surprisingly good and he delivered the whole affair with a real downbeat air while I'm sure some pressure must have been on him to deliver a big budget action movie for the summer season. He is well supported by the designers behind the visuals.Those seeking action to compare with the Matrix (or even action) will feel let down and I can understand why  the trailers have talked up this side and talked down the social commentary side (and this is a damning verdict of how public tastes are viewed from Hollywood) but credit to the makers for producing a film that surprised me by how relevant it was. Over the coming years this will either become a thing of its time or more relevant than ever (I hope the former) but right now it is an effective story, told with the unreal air of graphic novel but with enough to link it to the present to keep it relevant. I was genuinely surprised by how good it was and how engaged I was by it.",Null,6,12,11 December 2006
The Island," No brain or logic to any of it and the noisy action isn't enough to cover the problems
","Lincoln Six Echo is one of many people who survived the contamination of the outside world and now live in an enclosed complex where everything from their diet down to their daily clothing to managed for them. They live and peaceful but controlled life with their only ambition being to win the regular lottery and be taken away to the Island  the last place on earth that is outside and free of contamination. However Lincoln begins to question the logic of the whole thing when he finds a bug that has 'survived'. His suspicions lead to discoveries about the truth behind the complex and his very existence and sees him and Jordan Two Delta fleeing the complex with a small army on their trail.The issue of cloning and such is a timely focus for The Island given the debate over stem cell research etc at the moment, so this film would have benefited from producing food for thought as a side-order to lots of action. However when you have Michael Bay as your director it is unlikely that he is going to be able to pull that off and indeed this film pretty much fails to do anything with the cloning issue of any value other than using it to remake Logan's Run and make lots of stuff go bang and fall down. This means that the majority of the film is just used to set up the next chase scene and we are not allowed to think (or indeed given any encouragement to do so) while the script ignores any moral complexity in the issue and just makes this about two people running away from a well-funded conspiracy  the reasons don't really matter after a while. This is a real shame because it could have been so much more interesting and so much more challenging but instead it just treads the genre line and soon the narrative has lost all impact and you find yourself wishing the next thing would just hurry up and explode. Bay may not have written the film but he is just as much to blame for this as the writers; you do get the feeling that he thinks everything by be solving by having a helicopter shot sweep around his characters on a mountain top.Which is not a bad thing in itself because the film does produce one or two enjoyable action sequences but you do have to ask yourself if it is worth 130 minutes for 'one or two' impressive special effects? I would say no because, although they do look impressive, they do lack genuine tension, mainly because we have no real concern or interest in the characters or their story. So yeah, things fall down in very expensive ways and if that is all you want then welcome aboard but personally I just got tired of the hollow noise I was watching. The cast don't do anything to help either, nor could they be expected to without any material to work with. McGregor appears to have forgotten how to act after three Star Wars movies spent in front of a blue screen  he is boring here and about as far from being an action star as he is from being the impressive young Scottish actor he was when I first saw him. Johansson is sexy and currently hot property but this will not allow her to produce many more films like this where she just sleep walks her way through a performance that could have been delivered by any blonde starlet. Bean is a good baddie but I'm sure he could have done more had the material been there to use his character as a source of moral complexity, but we'll never know. Likewise Hounsou is OK but the material is just not there to make him interesting or a threat. Buscemi is always a welcome addition but you do have to wonder why Duncan bothered.Overall a noisy hollow action movie whose one or two thrills might be enough to satisfy some genre fans but not the majority. The script could have been an enjoyable mix of action thrills and moral complexity but it feels like it was generated by a computer and it fails to engage on any level  even failing to inject tension and pace into the action or the narrative. Could have been more but is really just a ho-hum action movie that has nothing really to recommend it for or make it stand out in a sea of much better action blockbusters.",Null,4,8,21 November 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Another gem from the Coens
","Based on homer's Odyssey, we follow Everett Ulysses McGill and his companions Delmar and Pete as they escape from a chain gang so that McGill can get home to his family.  Along the way they must deal with sirens, a bible selling Cyclops, Babyface Nelson, a campaigning Governor, a Klan lynching party and a blind prophet.This is another of the Cohen brothers `different' projects - basically meaning that nothing will make a great deal of sense and won't always follow logical paths but will be full of imagination and energy.  The story won't always be gripping unless you know Ulysses' original adventure.  If you do then the story will be a joy, as you recognise the parallels between the two tales.  Even if you don't there is plenty to enjoy here, the story is so full of funny, imaginative and original characters that you can't help but be drawn in.  From Badalucco's Babyface Nelson (`Oh George, not the livestock'), to Durning's Pappy, everything is handled with such an edge of surrealism that it's captivating.Clooney has never been better and is truly excellent here with his eccentric hick character with a taste for hair cream.  Turturro is also excellent, but Nelson's childlike Delmar is the best character and a great performance. Hunter is as good as she usually is in Coen stuff and the support cast of Durning, Goodman, Badalucco etc are all great.  The music is fantastic, even if you not a fan of this type of music it still fits so totally with the mood of the film that it all works well together.This is a wonderful film - yet another from the Coens.  It has it's slow moments and the episodic nature of the story can sometimes give it an aimless feel, but overall this is significantly better than the sum of it's many great parts.",Null,7,10,4 February 2002
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Silly and amusing rather than funny but good fun if you are in an undemanding mood
","As a child, Ricky Bobby was heavily influenced by the 'second is nothing' mantra of his amateur race driver and regular absentee father. As an adult he is working as one of the pit crew for the worst team in NASCAR when he gets the chance to drive and marks himself out with his determination and drive to win. Replacing the regular driver, Bobby starts to dominate the sport and quickly finds himself on top of the NASCAR world. However when a French formula 1 champion joins the sport, Bobby finds himself not only having to come to terms with a competitor but also the injury and trauma associated with a massive crash.Having enjoyed some similar comedies recently so although I never made it to the cinema, I did want to check out Talladega Nights on DVD in the hope of good laughs in a silly sports movie. The thing is, conceptually it is all well and good, delivering a silly concept with a wonderfully absurd load of dialogue to match the characters. On paper (and in the clips) it looked great and here and there it did produce the odd laugh from me. Problem is, in the delivery it is not as funny as I would have liked. It is amusing though and I did enjoy the way it affectionately digs at the very male and American sport of Nascar (does any other country in the world actually care about it?) in the characters and the dialogue.The big budget allows for plenty of car action but, with me caring so little about the sport, it was not really that engaging even if it was noisy. Personally I would have preferred a lot more work to have gone into the script rather than the action because maybe it could have just been a bit funnier. The cast are mostly good though and it did make me think that they could have done more with the material if it had been stronger. Ferrell is pretty good and enjoys his character but mostly he is outdone by a great performance from Reilly. Support is good from Duncan, Cole and others, but Tumlin and Russell caught my eye with two tremendously foul-mouthed characters. Cohen is part of the wonderful silliness that the film wears as a strength and I really enjoyed his brief turn here.Overall then, consistently amusing rather than as funny as it should been. The cast do well even if the material doesn't let them be the best they could have been. Silly stuff then but reasonably enjoyable if you are in an undemanding mood.",Null,0,1,10 September 2007
Semi-Pro," Uninspiring fare
","The Tropics are an unsuccessful basketball team in the ABA who are mainly kept afloat by the deep pockets and shameless self-promotion of their owner-player-coach Jackie Moon. However the team looks to be coming to an end as the league is collapsing and has agreed to a merger with the much more popular NBA - although only four teams will go through. After forcing a vote in the ABA committee, Jackie gets the pre-selected four teams changed to be the top four teams of that season - a victory only of sorts as his beloved Tropics are far from that lofty league position. So the race begins for Jackie to get his team winning and hit the other requirements to become a NBA team.Semi-Pro did not really appeal to me when it was advertised because, in so many ways, I felt I had seen the plot, the jokes and the characters before in many other 'wacky' sports movies. When it would come to me on DVD instead of me going to it though I decided to give it a try and waited for a time when I was in a simple mood so I could enjoy it. Sadly it turned out to be worse than I thought and the whole film feels like everyone going through a tick list and doing things without a great deal of inspiration or energy. It has its silly moments that some will enjoy but mostly the gags are not that good and it came across like the writer was reliant on the cast to make it sparkle in a way that he hadn't on paper. Outside of the gags we have subplots that don't work and moments of semi-seriousness that only serve to bore the viewer rather than engage - for example I am not sure why I was supposed to care about Monix and Lynn or why so much time was given over to their relationship.Fans of this type of film may still enjoy this but for the majority of people it will be a case of too much doing too little and the stuff that does show potential not being that well delivered. A lot of the fault rests with the writer Armstrong, a man whose recent work is less than inspiring but lets share the blame to include the directing debut of Alterman, someone who clearly has clout enough to make this happen without anyone suggesting he might not be up to it. His direction does not suit the material and he cannot draw the comedy out. I assume that he too must have been hoping that the right cast will make it fly, but it doesn't happen. Ferrell himself is not to blame as he does his best with what he has and indeed his Jackie Moon character is a good enough one by his standards. The problem comes from the material as it doesn't rise to meet him - a problem that abandons him but leaves others bogged down. Harrelson is the worst victim as he has to carry a character and subplot that nobody cares for - likewise Tierney is wasted. Benjamin and the other players are OK but Arnett and Daly are only sporadically funny in roles that were infinitely funnier in Dodgeball.Semi-Pro is not a terrible film and it certainly will have some viewers in stitches but for me personally it was tiresome in too many ways. Whole parts of it just didn't work within the requirements of the genre and too many sequences just seemed reliant on the cast pulling something out by their mere presence. The end result is uninspiring at best and there are many other films that are just like this one that are better than this tired effort.",Null,4,7,10 August 2008
Furious 7," Fun nonsense even if it carries itself with an earnestness it doesn't warrant, and complexity in the action that doesn't add to the fun
","As high-brow as I would like to think I am, I do enjoy a good blockbuster and for many, many years, the Fast & Furious franchise has been there offering up something for that habit. I won't pretend to remember all the films (this is not their role) but mostly I have enjoyed the last couple of the big dumb fun they provide. As a result I was looking forward to this film, while also knowing it would be nonsense. To be fair, the film mostly delivers on that remit, which is to say that it is overblown nonsense, but that it does provide a certain amount of fun with its world which crosses the sexuality of music videos with the action of video games â€“ which is a combination that fits well with the target audience.This is not to say that Furious Seven gets it right throughout, because it doesn't. Even by the standards of the series, the action is overblown, and the defiance of gravity is extreme, and it doesn't always work. To really be enjoyable and to be 'fun' rather than 'daft' one does need to have some engagement in the action, but in this case the narrative devices and the action sequences are so overblown and lacking in anything to hook to, that it does rather make them overblown, but losing out in the fun a little bit. It is a balance that I think the last couple of films has done better. In addition to this the film carries itself with a bit too much earnestness. Okay, this is the seventh film, which makes this a great franchise with characters which we have in theory invested years in; so perhaps there is justification for some soapy elements to the narrative? Other than the (well handled) ending for Walker, the rest doesn't really work and just seems to take up time that could be better spent.Actually that time could have been edited out, because as well as carried its longevity a bit too much, it also has a running time that doesn't totally suit it. The content screams disposable and slick, but the 2 hours + running time works against this; it is a film that could have done with fewer 'things' going on, and would have been leaner as a result. Having said that, all those things do bring lots of good cast members onboard, even if most of them don't have a great deal to do. Emmanuel, Hounsou, Russell, even Iggy Azalea â€“ lots of names and faces. It is even nice to see that the film gives Tony Jaa a couple of well shot scenes (not seen him in many of those recently). The regular cast are their usual selves. Walker is slick and fits this series well â€“ the montage at the end shows how much the films will miss him as he is by far the star of the films, regardless what Diesel thinks. Speaking of which, the big man is front and centre of this one, but he never looks natural in front of the camera â€“ his body is awkward and he doesn't look the match of the others in his scenes. Specifically Russell (taking his cheque but at least having fun) and Dwayne Johnson (other commitments but still is a good lead). Statham is a good villain but doesn't get as much use as I would have liked; the usual supporting cast are fun, with Gibson and Luda being quite funny, while Rodriguez at least gives the film one female character who is, well, a character, as opposed to a body part.The seventh film in this franchise is just what you expect it to be in the broad sweep of things. It is not as fun as the previous films, and it doesn't carry the soapy material, all the baggage, and the longer running time, but when it is being big and dumb with a smile on its face, it is hard not to like.",Null,1,18,4 November 2015
The Godfather," Great look at a family based around crime
","Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.  Now that's respect.",Null,49,79,1 July 2002
