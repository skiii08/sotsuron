Requiem for a Dream," Truely insane!
","This film is enough to make a person insane.  I like it!!   Aronofsky is  a true artistic visionary.  His use of sound and flashing images screws with your head, and with the performance of Ellen Burstyn.  You can truely see and feel just what's going on in her drugged out mind.  Well what do you know is that Wayan's kid trying to become respectable actor? I think so. This film is jam packed in intense emotion and can feel every bit of it as it screams of the screen.",Null,0,0,2 June 2001
The Mummy Returns," Special Effects needed to cover script flaws.
","This movie like many others relies much to heavily on special effects.  A little too much.  When that happens something has to suffer, like the script. Although there were some good effects, some just seemed corny and stupid. Rachel Weisz is Hot.",Null,0,0,28 May 2001
