Walk the Line," Stunning!
","This one took me completely by surprise! For once I wasn't let down by the fuzz. The last time that happened was with Magnolia. Every aspect of the film is as close to perfect as can be, and I must say that both Phoenix (of course) and especially Witherspoon (concidering her previous track record) were amazing in their respective roles. A minor letdown were Taylor Hilton as Elvis, who didn't even remotely possessed the power and charisma of Elvis.There is really not much else I could say about it. You got to experience it! Shamelessly entertaining! Don't believe the detractors. They are all over-analytical sociopaths, and just full of what sane people would call b....hit!",10,0,0,16 July 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," You know what to expect.. Or?
","Horror-flicks, lately have all been quite limitless in the level of violence they portray so if you rent or attend a film like this you basically know what you've gotten yourself into. However, with this one I think a border has been crossed, that shouldn't have been crossed.One thing is to portray unthinkable violence and abuse among adults, but I think the heavy involvement of a newborn child was unnecessary, and the people behind, and participating in this film must really sit down and think about what they've done. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of horror movies, but this one went way too far!",5,0,2,12 July 2006
The Descent," Surprise!
","Wow! One of the few movies the past couple of years that I really enjoyed! The story line is pretty basic but everything else is spot on. The light setting, timing, sound and atmosphere of the film is breathtaking! -What is it with the typically stadium-lighted American horror/science fiction films??? I guess flashlights, lighters and matches over there are quite potent then? The acting is first class, compared to the typical American horror-flick. These girls really look scared!! And the monsters are... -convincing and grotesque! 'First Blood' were banned, and later heavily cut in Norway. These days the most violent action and horror films (like this one and Land of the dead)) gets pass uncut, with a 15 certificate! Hmmm...",10,7,15,30 November 2005
