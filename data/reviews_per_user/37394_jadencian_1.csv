Walk the Line," Joaquin and Reese were absolutely amazing!!!
","I still can't believe they sang every song in the movie. I stayed to watch the credits role to see who the actual vocals were done by and I was awe struck. I thought Joaquin a fine actor (extremely handsome too) before this movie and knew that his star would eventually shine once given the 'right' script/movie and this is it. He brought Johnny Cash back to life and introduced me to this music for the first time. If Joaquin doesn't WIN the best actor Oscar for this, shame on the Academy!Reese Witherspoon should seriously consider a singing career, along with her acting career. There are so many other actresses out there that are and she has so much more talent. If she hadn't starred in this movie, this would definitely be the case of talent wasted. I wished the movie was longer! It touched my heart because the actors didn't seem like they were 'acting'! I have hope once again that true love does indeed exist!",10,8,14,11 December 2005
