The Benchwarmers," An insult to any movie watcher or ball player
","First of all....this is easily the most excruciatingly stupid film ever....Second, there are actual rules to the game of baseball, and this film follows absolutely none of them....Third, what the hell is this garbage? Fourth, are you kidding me? Fifth, 40 year-old men against 6th and 7th graders? They BETTER win...Sixth, you cannot be serious! Seventh, WALK ROB SCHNEIDER'S CHARACTER>>>>JEEZ!!!!!!!! Eighth, C'MON!!!Ninth, I am a stupider person for watching this movie....Tenth, this film is AWFUL!!!",1,5,9,2 August 2006
Crash," Great dialogue.....great movie....
","I am always relieved when a filmmaker (Paul Haggis) dares to trust his audience to understand the nuance and brilliance of what he is creating. With fantastic dialogue and tremendous characters, 'Crash' is one of the best films of the year. Playing mightily upon our deepest fears and even deeper convictions about what it is to be human, 'Crash' effortlessly hands the baton off to the multitude of characters again and again....In a 36 hours period, every character created by Haggis is affected by the world around him or her. And while we all like to think that nothing bothers us or affects us unless we want it to, we are quickly shown that is simply not the case. Everyone exists in this unfair world falling prey to the venom spewed forth by the human race.Genius...",9,3,9,6 October 2005
The Village," Not original, and not enough
","While I certainly may be holding M. Knight to a higher standard(and unfairly so), the main motivations and the central themes of 'The Village' are profoundly weak.That which motivates this film is quite simply not enough to justify my attention for almost 2 hours. This film is not bad, just not great, and it will have no 'legs' at all.I understand that its difficult for a director to hit a game-winning homerun every time out, but this film at best is a run scoring groundout in the 4th inning.",Null,0,0,3 August 2004
"I, Robot"," Does anyone else see that this film is 'I, Mudd'?
","Being a ridiculous Star Trek fan, does anyone see that this story is very similar, symbolically, to the old series of Star Trek's episode entitled 'I, Mudd?'Granted, perhaps BOTH the Star Trek episode and 'I, Robot' are based on an Issac Asimov story from the 60's, but I feel this is just another example of Hollywood losing originality and zest, and becoming a sequel/remake machine........(yawn)Hire more writers, become more attentive to story lines, and stop 'Green lighting' garbage like 'Catwoman', 'Thunderbirds', 'Around the World...', and 'King Arthur', all remakes/sequels to superior film-making.",Null,1,1,3 August 2004
American Beauty," Perhaps the greatest American film of the last 10 years...
","There are those who go through life pretending to be satisfied in every way when nearly all of us are anything but. This tremendous piece of cinematic work drives home the truth: all of us desperately wish for our youth and all its irresponsibility and vibrancy to return to us, but the fact is its gone forever, and our lives will never be as satisfying as it was back then.American Beauty is the symbolic dream of all adults everywhere in the world to somehow recapture any and all aspects of their youth. In fact, many are desperate for exactly that. So much so that while we deny it to ourselves, we fantasize every day and night about the reality that we all would in fact do ANYTHING to return to our youth and stay there forever. Only after we age and become jaded to the world do we lose the pure joy that comes with being alive as we realize that existence revolves around trade-offs and compromise.The character of Lester Burnham is classically created as we all see ourselves: initially weak, and only strong when independent, and it is that independence which ultimately destroys him. Perhaps moreso than any character in film in the last 10 years, Lester encapsulates the brutal truth that if one chooses to rebel against the conformity of the American Dream, one risks an enormous amount, even their own death. American Beauty is a fantastic voyage of the mind and soul through the eyes of quiet desperation, as one by one we all acquiesce to the reality that life ultimately grinds us all under its plow.",Null,0,2,15 November 2004
The Alamo," Historically accurate, historically unmarketable
","This film is perhaps the most fulfilling and detailed story of the quintisential American hallmark of bravery and heroism.  And yet while the story nearly writes itself, Disney has made the near-fatal error of misreading their audience.  Very few, if anyone, wants to see a movie graphically illustrating the death of americans, famous or otherwise, in a hopeless battle.  'The Alamo' is a great film about a topic that many people try to avoid exposing themselves to: Americans locked in a battle they know they cannot win.There is another Dennis Quaid film called 'Come see the Paradise' about the American government's unlawful detainment of asian-americans during World War II.  While historically accurate (and an important story that every american should read and know), most Americans avoid intentionally exposing themselves to aggressive and shameful moments in their history.  'The Alamo' is a tough sell because the entire film is contaminated with the truth that all the characters within the Alamo's walls are killed, some of them horribly so.  No one wants to see that, even if it IS american history.",Null,4,5,24 April 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Best Book and the Best Movie....
","An edgier, darker, more mature Harry returns to Hogwarts School with his friends Hermione and Ron ready to take on yet another adventure in his world of wizardry. New characters, mixed in with the old, is the precise recipe for a great sequel that is followed perfectly by director Alfonso Cuarón. Kudos to Cuarón and Warner Brothers for matching story to artist with seamless accuracy.Harry and friends become embroiled within the fascinating story of murder and revenge as Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an old friend of Harry's father, escapes the wizard prison of Azkaban where he has been held for 12 years. Accused of murder, Black seeks to reveal the truth about all things, mostly about what happened that mystical night when Harry escaped Lord Voldemort's wrath long ago. Werewolves, Animagis, and the growth of already established characters make this film by far the best of the three. With fresh faces and a fresh story (unlike 'Chamber of Secrets', which is essentially a continuation of the first film), the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a delight for young and old.",Null,0,0,18 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Meet the new Star Wars....same as the old Star Wars....
","There are times as a critic and as a movie watcher where your expectations are so low that if the movie being seen has ANY redeeming qualities, it is automatically 'great'.If people walk through the desert looking for water and find none, they will drink the sand.Viewers and fans of Star Wars are intelligent and critically sound people. They have been desperate for another great Star Wars film, as they should be, because this story is a wonderful tale of good and evil battling each other for redemption and absolution. George Lucas at long last has revealed himself to be what I have long suspected since the early 80's when he was unable to duplicate the success of Star Wars: a horrible writer and a hack one-hit wonder. All he has and all that he pretends to be is a direct result of one brilliant bubble gum film made in 1977.My frustration with Lucas' butchering of something that writes itself is at an end. Nowhere in any of the pre-quels is anything resembling greatness or aforethought. Indeed Lucas has made three films that are so benign of story that at times one feels sick. The dialogue is abysmal, the editing is sophomoric and jumpy, lacking any cohesion whatsoever. And the critical basis of Anakin's turning to the dark side is laughable.Take a lesson from Shkespeare. In 'Othello', the character of Iago is a terrifyingly evil one who causes havoc and despair with all that he does and says. His character's greatness comes from one truth: he is evil for the sake of being evil. Iago, granted, was 'passed over' for promotion by Othello, but that does not justify the absolute decadence that came with his character from that moment on. Indeed, Iago was evil mostly because he was very good at it, and he enjoyed having absolute power over everyone.My contention is this: why cannot Anakin turn to the dark side simply because in becomes hypnotized and mesmerized by the power and pleasure of being evil? What draws us to The Terminator? or Hannibal Lecter? or DARTH VADER? It is the absolute power and fear generated by an entity that can do anything it wants to any one at any time.So no, this film DOES NOT redeem George Lucas, and yes, Star Wars III is as awful as I and II. Enough already, because trust me, Lucas is cackling the cackle of the Dark Lord of the Sith all the way to the bank.....",6,3,8,24 May 2005
