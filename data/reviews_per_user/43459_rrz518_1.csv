United 93," Disturbing, as it should be
","I couldn't take my eyes off of it. As a matter of fact, I literally sat on the edge of the seat.This is not a political statement, no preaching, yet it is as powerful as a film can get. Leaves the audience silent and speechless at the conclusion.It accurately and totally captures the chaos of the day. One plane, then the next, then the next, etc. The way the passengers (and the hijackers of 93) learn about the prior incidents is much the same that we all did..., shockingly, with the fear of 'what in the world is going on, what's next?'.",10,1,4,30 April 2006
