Hereditary," Intensely.... boooooring
","Again, I dont know where to start.It goes from boring, to bad, to worse, to straight up comedy bad at the end.Its at least two hours and 4 minutes too long.All things 'good' in this movie are contained in the trailer.Watch the trailer, its enough. Do not waste time on this spinal tap of a movie.Its a joke right? Its made as a joke, or a tax write off? Its a joke!",1,2,5,27 August 2018
A Quiet Place," Just silly
","I'm sorry but this is stupid beyond belief.The main characters clearly arent survivalists or they would have taught their kids to shut up. Which they clearly havent. With 6-12 year old kids which havent learned a damn thing over sereral years, it would appear, they decide to bring a newborn in to a world were quiet is the only means to survive.Seriously?How in the h*** do they expect a newborn to be quiet, when the older kids have no sense at all? A mattress covering a hole in the floor sure wont cut it when a ticking egg clock sets these things off. The box might work, if they are near it 100% of the time the first years of the kids life, until the kid understands. Good luck with that considering the other inept kids. Unless the kid is kept in the box 100% of the time.By the way, what on earth is powering all the security cameras and other stuff? Surely not a loud generator? Batteries wouldnt last.The only thing scary about this is the script. Cant grasp why it did so well at the box office.",1,63,123,27 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Somewhat disappointed
","Well, I went to see it with quite low excectations on the basis of the directors past efforts, namely Looper.I thought 'why not give the guy a chance', and I had hopes that i'd be positively surprised. Unfortunately I wasnt.Now, dont get me wrong. Its not at all a bad movie. It's just not up to par and the standards one should be able to expect from the SW fanschise. Its an ok movie, but nothing more.The main greivance I have is the outright plagiarism from earlier installments such as Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. Its beyond obvious and I'm still kind of stunned by how blatantly it was done. Come on, show some creativity as a director. One should be able to expect that at least.There are still good things about it. The fx, as one expected, are great. Its fun, there's a lot of humour in it. Hamill is intense and impressed me. Some nice new ships, a few nice fights and Serkis is great as usual. The cast does a good job over all.I was sceptical right away when the announced the director for this one, he didnt prove me wrong at least, and its really sad that he's been 'given' the franchise - more or less - and named director of three more SW movies.",6,37,66,13 December 2017
