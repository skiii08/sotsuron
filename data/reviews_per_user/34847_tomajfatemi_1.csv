Come and See," Come and See, was very good movie because
","Come and See, was very good movie because its way of showing us the strong emotions that was expressed by characters when they experienced true horrors of Nazi occupation. It made me, and believe anyone that has ever see it emotional effected by it, and its because of not making it unreal by putting unreal special effects and other stuff that typical Hollywood movies have. It also, didn't just show a Russian interpretation of the war, that was a glories victory of the great Soviet union an Stalin, instead it showed the true suffering and killing of ordinary people in Russia.very good movie !!!",8,0,0,5 June 2012
