Hereditary," The trust is all gone!
","This movie is about a bunch of cultists who try to find a new host to this king of hell. It takes them 2h of our time to do it. For the first 1,5h nothing really happens, and then you get a bunch of dead bodies, bunch of naked old farts smiling at you, somehow that is more scarier than anything in this movie. The guy who is about to get invaded by either the cultists or a king of hell is at one point screaming, 'This is just a dream, wake up.' Well, at the end of it, i was screaming the same thing! Bottom line, you are now a king of hell in your new body and your followers are all just as old as you are and completely naked. You can see the disappointment on his face, and trust me, that is not fear or despair. You got time to waste, feel free to watch this crap. It will keep your attention till the end, and that is why i gave it 2 stars.",2,2,6,6 November 2018
The Disaster Artist," Made me laugh!
","Oh, long time since a movie made me laugh so hard. I mean, its not all about comedy, its a good movie, the fact that is close to actual events is making it even more awesome. Worth the watch, especially since i saw The Room. Franko nailed it!",8,0,2,26 February 2018
