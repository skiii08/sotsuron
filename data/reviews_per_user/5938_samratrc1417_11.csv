The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The most sober vampire movie ever made!!
","Breaking Dawn was the best novel in the Twilight series penned by Stephanie Mayer and as I found out a little while ago Twilight Sage - Breaking Dawn Part-I might be the best movie of the lot till date. The hallmark of Twilight series is the simplicity of the plot with a great emphasis on romance, and with generous bits of vampires and werewolves thrown in together. As a Harry Potter aficionado I at first didn't like the overtly simple tone of the novels (I still think Twilight would have turned into a work of art had a writer of J.K Rowling's caliber worked on it)but the intrigues of the Bella, Edward and Jacob trinity finally roped me in. As any reader would know the movie starts with Bella and Edward getting married. I have seen a lot of movie weddings but I think this one would take the cake. The wedding scenes were simply spectacular and so was the locales selected for shooting. I could see the ladies in the theater practically drooling as the sight of such magnificence. Its a girl's dream come true - marrying the man of their dreams in a fantasy wedding and honeymoon and getting an awesome family too - At 18??. Which girl doesn't dream of it (or so my wife says).Then the drama started. The kids did some acting for a change. I am not saying that I saw Brando,Pacino and Hepburn in action here but given the storyline and tween premise of the movie I would say they did well. Lets give them credit. They have been playing these characters for a while now. Anyway, I wouldn't give away the story as I am sure a lot of non-readers would be watching the movie so I ask them to go and find out for themselves. Anybody can sense that part two will be a lot more action packed as I think the book envisages a Deathly Hallows and The Return of the King kind of finale. Its not in the 'Godfather' category but I'm sure even non-fans will not begrudge some praise for this one. Its a couple of hours of solid entertainment(even in the mid-east with heavy editing). So go and watch it.",Null,6,26,16 November 2011
Skyfall," Definitely,way better than its (Daniel Craig) predecessors...
","I had watched this movie at its midnight screening and oddly enough I found it to be better than the other two Daniel Craig rendition of the man with a license to kill. That might be because of its director Sam Mendes (Academy award winner for American Beauty-2000) who actually tries to tell a story instead of making a mishmash of action and chase sequences, putting in a couple of really beautiful women, and of course the inevitable and implausible bond villains. It still has all that but this time it seems to have a coherent story line. If you have followed the work of Mendes over his career, you will be aware that he is a consummate storyteller and thats where Skyfall is different from its predecessors. It actually tell a story. It has a very stylized cinematography and has been shot in exotic locales. It has some surprise elements which will affect future Bond films (I am trying very hard not to give away spoilers). It also sheds a lot of insight into the origin of the man we have come to love and admire.My only concern was the misuse of Javier Bardem as the villain Raoul Silva. Make no mistake,he is a brilliant actor but he seems to be miscast. His attempts to portray a megalomania-cal villain fit for the Bond genre fall flat as I believe his part was not well written. He tries to do justice to it but ultimately fails. Its a pity, as he was one of the primary reasons I went to watch the movie. And Adele's version of the opening track reminds us of the Shirley Bassey songs of yore (Goldfinger anybody???). Overall its a very interesting watch and its value for money.",8,6,15,26 October 2012
Iron Man 2," A great follow-up!!!!
","I was bored today and wanted to catch a movie. It was quite a shock when i found out Ironman II was playing. I was under the impression it was going to release on the 7th of May. Great!!I queued up and saw it, blessing my lucky stars!Wow!It's amazing to see the number of actors joining the directors club. We knew Jon Favreau was good when we saw 'Elf'. He just keeps on getting better. This is phenomenal. I am afraid this movie is not for 'artsy' type. Girls and refined folks! Advice for y'all! Keep away. This ain't your scene! This is a plain and simple hardcore action movie with a great story and even greater action. Mind blowing action! Both the movies have great scripts. Favreau is lucky with that one. And awesome actors playing them. I am not gonna give away the story. I recommend you see for yourself. If ever there was a 'Phoenix' in Hollywood, its Robert Downey Jr. A decade ago he was convicted and imprisoned. The only thing going for him was Ally Macbeal. Hollywood had written him off. Now he's headlining two big franchises. Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes. Speaks volumes about his quality. He rose from his ashes. The other 'Phoenix' being Micky Rourke. He's just awesome as 'Whiplash'. I think i will add some 'Vankoism' in my vocabulary when i criticize any software...'Thees sooftwer ees sheeet' in a Russian accent.I know i didn't give much of a review because i don't want to prejudice any potential viewer. All i am going to say is 'You will not be disappointed'. I leave you with that note and let you judge for yourself....",10,13,26,29 April 2010
The English Patient," Love story in the magnitude of a 'Casablanca'
","I have heard an awful lot about 'The English Patient' and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. What I found out was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral zealot, I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. It's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence. Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks.",10,2,4,29 January 2006
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The best ever MI...Beats the first one hands down..
","Ghost Protocol-Whatever that means, has laid down the ghosts of MI-II and III. They were good but not this good. Brad Bird's directorial debut shows that he's equally comfortable in a live action movie as he is doing an animated feature. The script chosen is top notch and the audience really was kept guessing as to what happens next. The locales were exotic-Moscow,Dubai,& Mumbai.This is a Tom Cruise vehicle through and through. He shows us why he is the biggest star in the world save perhaps a few. He still does his stunts (or so I am told-at this age)and stunts in an MI movie were aplenty. Humor is also thrown in a liberal doses, which makes it refreshing. Simon Pegg tickles your funny bones, Paula Patton brings in the oomph factor - never seen her before but she's hot. Renner as Brandt has some skeletons in the closet but he's the new member in team Hunt. Wonder why they did away with Ving Rhames - he was good. Micheal Nyquist - Those of you who know who he is (Dragon Tattoo anyone?) is good in his character. Wonder where he got his British accent from (He's Swedish)? Or did they do a voice-over? And Tom Cruise is immaculate. The best action movie of 2011 and I am glad they didn't go the Arab terrorist route. Its well worth the watch. Money and time well spent.",9,5,10,17 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Cheesy ending to a cheesy series!!!
","As I had not read the book, I was eagerly awaiting the part II of Breaking Dawn. I wanted to know what happens to Vampire Bella and her newly adopted clan of Vampires. And find out I did!! I just ended up watching the long awaited sequel of the immensely funny parody called 'Vampires Suck'. But this was Breaking Dawn Part II I had just watched. Or am I confused? Are they one and the same or not? You decide. In any case, Bella apparently had a baby and we had seen in the previous edition that Edward had turned her into a vampire to save her from almost certain death while delivering the half human half vampire baby. That apparently is a threat to the Volturi and this leads to an all out war with the Cullens. A lot of ham acting, silly incidents, and CGI mayhem later, we finally got to leave, thankful that there aren't any more of this farce to wait for (stupidly, I might add),in the future. And to quote from 'FRIENDS' 'This is two hours of my life, I am never getting back'.PS - This is not a finale like that of the Lord of the Rings: The return of the King (or I have an egg on my face for comparing the two)! Kudos to both Stephanie Meyer and Kirsten Stewart for creating and acting the asinine character of Bella respectively. I am sure a whole bunch of Razzie nominations await!!",5,12,31,15 November 2012
Super 8," Super 8 is superb!!!
","I just watched it this afternoon!It surpassed my expectations which was heightened by the trailer. The trailer made me curious as to whether this was a sci-fi movie or a monster flick. There might be a lot of holes in the storyline but cinematic-ally the script was awesome as it kept me riveted to my seat. J J Abrams is turning into one of the greats of the cinematic medium. The concept/premise of the movie is nothing new but its the treatment that makes it such a delight. We have a bunch of youngsters who are student filmmakers. While shooting a scene from their 'zombie flick' they witness a train crash(that much you might have garnered from the trailer). The rest i leave it for you to watch as i might give away the storyline...The strength of the movie is the young cast who puts in a superb performance..I loved them especially because most of them are completely unknown and fresh. That made them totally believable. We all know the Fannings can act. This movie has something in it for both teenagers as well as adults. The teen romance, loss of loved one, horrifying disappearances, military cover up...the list goes on. Its a good film to study if you are a budding script writer. Its teaches you how to write a movie that satisfies everyone.Anyway...Its one hell of a popcorn flick.. I assure you..your wont repent watching it..Go watch it.",9,2,6,16 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Best of the series.
",I may be a little too old to be Potterphile but i ain't ashamed of it.Yeah! i caught the show at a media screening and this is a too great movie to be viewed free.HAHA!lucky me!This is the best of the lot as whoever's read the books will agree with me that this is the most action packed of the 6 books.When i read it i knew it will make a heart stopper.The length of the book concerned me as i realized that there will be some cuts and chops or else the result will be a 'Lord of the Rings' styled mutimovie series adding up to some 5 hours.I had some doubts about the selection of Mike Newell as the director but he did a Peter Jackson with this movie.This may be the highest grosser this year eclipsing 'Star Wars Ep-III'. He's done a magnificent job shooting and editing this movie.Its smooth sailing.There was once a talk of replacing the cast with older actors but the decision to keep them looks great as as the 'Kids' are growing up with their characters.The casting is great as always but the only glitch appears to be the casting of 'Fleur Delacour'. Clemence is good but sometimes Emma'Hermione'Watson(who's supposed to be this ugly duckling in the books) looks better than her. Or maybe i am biased towards Emma.Anyway for you folks who will have to wait till its commercial release i am sure you will feel your time and money well spent.Go and watch it.Folks!,9,2,5,15 November 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Its pretty damn good!!!!!!
",I agree that Ritchie and his team of writers have taken a lot of liberties in this movie but i think thats good or else it would have turned into the same costume dramas of yore. Ritchie's brought in his unique Tarantino like style and feel to this movie about a character that has had umpteen interpretations since the dawn of the age of cinema. Its fresh (even though it has a feel of 'Snatch') and in a lot of ways very interesting as the story tries to catch the essence of Conan Doyle with modern Thomas Harris like leanings. I would be very much interested in a sequel and i would also be interested as to who might be cast as professor Moriarty (Tom Wilkinson/Gary Oldman comes to mind)...Kudos to Ritchie. The divorce didn't dampen his creative juices.,9,3,7,27 December 2009
Casino Royale," Best Bond since Connery
","Bond is back and with a bang. I admit in the beginning i was very sceptical about Daniel Craig being Bond. He did not look the part.I thought Hugh Jackman would have made a very suave Bond. Brosnan was suave but i was tired of the one line double entendres that were written into the scripts. Sean Connery was the definitive Bond as he had that presence and the raw menace of a person with a 'license to kill'. Daniel Craig brings that back.He is lean and physically fit and is already a proved actor.And he also brings a Steve McQueen 'coolness' to the role.His introduction to the audience with an Honey Ryder style emergence from the sea in a bathing trunk is a great way to pay tribute to Dr.No - Where the legend/legacy was created. I was hoping that the series doesn't go back to the 'action-comedy-farce' era of Roger Moore (very good in his aristocratic demeanor but a secret agent-NO WAY). The story is not overtly complicated. It goes back to the beginning-where it all started.That's refreshing for a change-a prequel.It has extremely gorgeous women. Eva Green(Benardo Bertalucci had remarked that she is so beautiful that its obscene) takes my breath away(most French actresses do). One thing i am grateful for is the lack of CGI. Its good old stunt work just like the old days. I'm no sexist but in the old films i was used to seeing Bernard Lee as M and since it is about the beginning where M was a man, Judi Dench (fabulous actress though)is a tad miscast.The villain wasn't villainous enough (remember Goldfinger,Blofeld?). All in all a great 'Craig' experience. Hope the next 2 installments with him are as good. Bravo!! Encore!!",10,2,5,20 November 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Very true to the book!! Excellent Finale!!
","It was a very fitting finale for a saga that has endeared us to these three kids turned young adults. We literally watched the troika grow in front of our eyes, sharing their trials and tribulations, their joys and sorrows, their success and failure in equal measure. We now see them carry out the grand responsibilities entrusted on them and bring them to its logical conclusion. They suffer great losses while achieving it but they did manage to rid the wizarding world of its greatest scourge and in turn save us muggles (he-who-must-not-be-named had threatened to rid the world of muggles) as well.Shot at great locales and powered by tour de force performances by our young thespians, aided by outstanding CGI effects the saga ends leaving an empty hollow in our chests. Whilst enjoying the cinematic journey in the theatre I was also overpowered by the sense of loss brought on by the realization that we wont be watching another one of these in the theatre again. I don't have any more to add as most of us know the books and so as a result knew what we were about to see. I had only one problem with this movie. There were some famous faces only seen in one or two scenes (Emma Thompson for instance). I wish they were given more screen time. All in all a great movie. Please go and watch it. Its a pity none of the HP films managed to gross over a billion. Some very pathetic ones did. Hope this one manages it aided by YOU.",10,12,28,12 July 2011
