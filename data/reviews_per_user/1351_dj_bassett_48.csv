Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 'Okay'
","I neither liked Vol. 1 as much as some fans did or hated it as much as others. I thought it was 'okay' -- basically an action/revenge cartoon with a Tarantinoesque gloss. Isolated parts, particularly the anime sequence and the wonderful House of Blue Leaves episode, were exciting filmmaking by any standard, but taken as a *whole* the movie seemed very lightweight and self-indulgent, more a case of Tarantino stylistically riffing on genres and characters he likes than an actual movie about real people doing real things. That probably sounds harsher than it really is:  I like action/revenge cartoons, and I enjoyed Vol. 1. But I don't understand those who see all sorts of depth in the movie. The movie this most reminded me of was FROM DUSK TIL DAWN.Vol. 2 has, I think, been overrated by a lot of critics who hated Vol. 1 and were looking for more traditional Tarantinoesque pleasures. Again, I think this is 'okay', not great, not awful. More talky and less action-oriented than 1, it follows Uma on her quest. This time out she goes after Madsen, Darryl Hannah, and of course Bill himself. Madsen's amazing, the best performance in the movie and the only one who felt actually 'real' to me. Hannah is very good, too. There's a flashback sequence with Gordon Liu as Pei Mei that harkens back to old school Seventies kung fu movies that's fun, especially for fans of those kind of movies. There's some clever casting in small roles, too --I'll just mention Bo Svenson in a nice bit as a country preacher. Some people like Uma in this -- I thought she did the best with a limited role, take that for what it's worth. Carradine has his moments, but he's basically playing David Carradine: the movie works best if you buy him as a Presence. I've never been a big fan of his and remained unmoved by his performance. Tarantino complicates Uma's quest here and it's interesting -- I just never really cared about Uma and Carradine's relationship, so the complication remained pretty intellectual to me (ie, I understood it but just didn't really care about it, either). The dialog is entertaining, and there's plenty of homages here, especially to Spaghetti Westerns.
Taken as a pair KILL BILL is good but lightweight, worth seeing but destined to be overrated. I am of the school that JACKIE BROWN is Tarantino's best movie, and the most interesting direction for him to go, but I like him a great deal and will definitely see his next movie, whenever it is.",Null,3,5,19 April 2004
Vertigo," Absolute Masterpiece
","For such an 'interior' movie, this gains a lot of power on the big screen. The locations become sort of imposing in their grandeur, like we've entered a kind of fairy tale, and Hitchcock's color scheme really comes alive.It's always impressive to see Stewart here. You watch this movie comfortable with good ol' Jimmy and suddenly  and it still comes as a shock, no matter how many times you watch it  you realize that good ol' Jimmy has completely lost his marbles. Kim Novak is also fine, and once you understand the central twist of the movie it becomes fascinating to watch her in the first half, with the understanding of what happens in the second.Vertigo is a movie you can watch endlessly, as it somehow manages to tap into some truly great mysteries: unattainable love, tragic love, loving an ideal vs. loving reality and the dangers of conflating the two, the inescapability of destiny, the cruelty of life and fate. It resists easy interpretation, as all great art does.",Null,2,4,3 October 2005
The New World," Beautiful, Mythopoetic
","Rather beautiful retelling of the first contact story in Jamestown. Farrell for once in his career is quite winning as the roguish, bad-man-trying-to-be-better John Smith, and the girl is exceptionally winning as Pocohantas. Exceptionally well photographed  one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, actually. You really need to see it on the big screen to appreciate it. Malick is also very good at capturing the essential foreignness of past times and cultures: this is a very difficult thing to do, as we tend to view the past through the lens of the present.Malick seems to view this story through the rather clichéd lens of Decadent White Men vs. Noble Savage. It's a tribute to his artistry that he takes such threadbare material and makes it powerful. I think Malick captures a lot of what the Europeans must've felt when they saw the New World, a sense of it as an Eden where people could start afresh. I think Malick, to his credit, also hints that the European romanticization of the Native American was based purely on their foreignness: after all, they're shown to be quite warlike in their own right. Still, it ought to be said that Malick never really transcends this notion the way a true artist ought. It feels derivative to me.Movie's biggest weakness, though, is a rather strange left turn ¾ of the way through into a conventional love story between Pocohantas and Christian Bale. This may well be historically accurate, and in fact on it's own terms it's kind of sweet, but it doesn't seem to fit into the movie proper. I would've preferred more with Wes Studi, who's a fine actor with little to do here. More importantly, his story makes more sense in the general scheme of things. Or at least I would've thought.Recommended, though, a movie worth experiencing for yourself. It has it's faults, but Malick is a true artist, with all that means.",Null,4,9,30 January 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," Beautifully done, though a bit unfocused
","I saw the Japanese subtitled version, and must concur in the praise given to the Japanese actors, particularly the guy doing Calcifer.I enjoyed this. This is the first Miyazaki movie I've ever seen (and one of the few animes) and I thought it was really beautifully done, with a pervasive sense of place and a nice sense of 'magical logic'(meaning a sense that the supernatural things one sees make a kind of sense, follow a kind of rule, even if it's not clear immediately what that is.) Movie suffers a bit from being thematically all over the place, from 'age is a state of mind' to 'make the best of the hand you're dealt' to a general distrust of power to what eventually becomes a kind of antiwar message. On the other hand, there is an utterly fantastic moment toward the end of the picture (where Sophie stumbles through a door and sees the young Howl make a bargain with the demon) which sent a real chill up my spine: it's the kind of thing you go to the movies to see. Recommended.",Null,1,2,28 June 2005
Lucky Number Slevin," Slight
","Narrative games are played throughout here, this is one of those movies where nothing is as it first appears to be. The pretext though is that Josh Hartnett is 'Slevin', a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time who gets caught between two rival gangland bosses.Very similar to THE USUAL SUSPECTS, though that was better plotted and a slyer game all around. Hartnett is a vacuous bowl of suck stuck right in the center of this, a good example of how bad casting can hurt a film. I suppose as an amiable doofus he's okay, but once he has to become effective he's pretty laughable.Structured clunkily, with the big reveal taking up far too much time (as Hartnett has to actually explain to us the plot -- most of which we've figured out, thank you very much). The script bounces around from the well written to the not-so well written: in general it suffers from a kind of self-regard or self-importance that afflicts a lot of Tarantino imitators. (It's interesting that Tarantino's imitators have never understood Tarantino's light touch.) On the other hand, it's mostly very well acted (outside of Hartnett) and that alone lifts a lot of it. Willis is becoming iconic, Freeman and Kingsley get to chew the scenery enjoyably, Lucy Liu is surprisingly winningly girly (a nice break from her Dragon Queen persona). Nicely cast even in small parts, too, with Stanley Tucci and Danny Aiello is small roles.I wouldn't search it out, but it's the kind of movie that, if it's playing on cable in a hotel room, you won't feel embarrassed about using it to kill some time.",4,29,63,22 April 2006
United 93," Superb
","It is difficult for any American alive and aware on 9/11 to look at this movie clearly. I believe some years will need to pass before we can look at this film as an aesthetic piece, a work of art. As it stands, the feelings are still too close to the surface for a lot of us. It's hard to separate what you think of this movie with what you think of the events being portrayed.I also think that the one sensible critique I've read of this movie, that it essentially lacks a theme, or some kind of perspective, is an accurate one. In a way Greengrass's achievement is tremendous here: he essentially disappears from his own movie. Much of this docudrama feels about a half step up from something like GUNNER'S PALACE, which was essentially a raw footage documentary with a narrator slapped on it. This strategy has ensured that the movie will be acceptable to the greatest possible audience, and that it won't alienate anybody sensible: it's a mirror, essentially, and will reflect back whatever political opinions you bring to the film. But those who question the point of the exercise ask an interesting and worthwhile question.All of that said, I found this an absolutely riveting movie, often excruciatingly intense and emotionally draining, yet still compelling. Greengrass's camera work is far more suited to this material then his previous action flick, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY -- he is not good at staging action choreography, but is exceptionally gifted at livening up static scenes, especially of people sitting around talking into microphones (much of the movie). A lot of the moral thrust Greengrass brought to SUPREMACY makes more sense here, too -- the one thing the movie does argue for is the obscenity of violence.I have a number of intensely-felt opinions about 9/11 and this story especially -- I don't think they're really to the point here. I am glad I saw the movie and think Greengrass has done this country a great service by making it, whatever it's successes or failures as an aesthetic piece.",Null,1,4,6 May 2006
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Oddly warm and good-hearted
","Brian, who's born at the same time as Jesus, gets involved in the political resistance to the Roman occupation, and later gets mistaken as the Messiah. Once controversial but now seems rather tame: the comedic pokes are relatively light, and are targeted not so much at Christianity or religion as zealotry of all stripes (note that political zealotry, here represented by revolutionary movements, is as much of a target as religion). Popular culture has essentially caught up with this film, but it's still pretty good:  Graham Chapman plays Brian as a put-upon Everyman, and he comes across as very sweet and likable. Plenty of funny bits -- my favorite is a scene involving Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate, telling his guards about some of his friends' names. The final messages of 'think for yourself' and 'keep your chin up' seem very warm and good-hearted to me. Recommended.",Null,0,2,9 May 2004
Underworld," Pretty but dumb
","During a long-standing war between vampires and werewolves, a vampire warrior (Beckinsale) becomes involved with a human who the werewolves are targeting. Beautiful to look at, all shiny and self-consciously Gothic like a Maxim spread. And in an abstract sense rather well directed, particularly in the action sequences, which are a nice absorption of Hong Kong influences. Unfortunately, though, the movie lacks an ounce of imagination or intelligence. For all of the money spent on it there's not that much by way of werewolf action or vampire action, really, for instance  there's something really disappointing about watching monsters fighting with guns. The plot is simplistic and predictable (one of the bad guys is named 'Craven' and he's, um, cowardly), the rationale behind what the monsters can do is fuzzily presented, at best (sometimes vampires just drain blood, sometimes they can turn people  but they can't seem to turn werewolves  although they can turn our superman), and on and on and on. A real pity, as there's some real talent at work here, but UNDERWORLD strikes one as all technique, no substance. You can't just watch Hong Kong Action movies and horror thrillers and think you can derive a story on that alone.",Null,1,3,26 August 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Just a great flick
","This is one of those ideas that is so obvious you end up hitting your head, wondering why you didn't think of it yourself: combine 28 DAYS with the British genre that's most famous nowadays, 'overgrown adolescents learn to accept responsibility and get lives'. In England, Shaun and his going-nowhere best friend are living lives of quiet desperation, until his girlfriend dumping him and, incidentally, a zombie uprising, causes Shaun to get a clue. I really liked this. This is almost a perfect blend of humor and seriousness: some people have knocked the film for this but I think it's just right, so much so that I actually got a little misty-eyed toward the end of the movie, and I can't say I've done that with any other release this year. Particularly funny is Shaun's early cluelessness during the outbreak.The movie does post-modernism proud, as it's both a play on genre conventions and a celebration of them: this is an extremely tough thing to pull off, but they manage to do it with style. Because it's mainly a riff on established conventions, not something unique, the movie does suffer from a certain diffuseness: early on it looks like the theme will be 'modern society creates zombies by itself' ala DAWN OF THE DEAD, but that soon gets abandoned, for instance, as there's too much other stuff to refer to. Still, the characters believe in what they're doing absolutely, which helps a lot in these sorts of things. Jokes aren't funny if the deliver is sniggering as he delivers them. This is the sort of thing KILL BILL was trying to do: I liked those movies but they never really congealed into more than the sum of their parts, the way this did. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is essentially a goof, an inside joke (in some ways the definition of post modernism) but it's a very good example of it. Highly recommended.",Null,1,2,26 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Disappointing
","The effects are good.Johnny Depp remains amusing.Keira Knightley is very beautiful up there on the big screen. I don't think she's well-cast in these big budget action spectaculars, though: she has a modest, quiet kind of talent that is just better served by costume dramas and romantic comedies and the like. Too much of the time she just feels drowned out by the action. And also, frankly, no offense to the girl power contingent, but who wants to see her in guy's clothes fighting? I fully agree with Sparrow: she should be in a dress or nothing at all.Orlando Bloom is a stick. I keep forgetting he's even in the thing.The movie more generally suffers from being fundamentally misconceived. Did anyone really care about Bloom's father issues? Or Ms. Knightley, torn between the two men in her life and then burdened with a third potential love interest? No, of course not. We all wanted to see the same damn movie as the first one, but this time with Depp as the star. Well, he's not exactly in a supporting role here -- this is more of an ensemble piece -- but he has to share a little too much screen time with everyone else, because this is a straight up continuation of the story. Like we care. This is especially a problem in the beginning: the set up is long and craftsmanlike, but it's all in the service of a bad idea, and it just weighs things down.I also thought the movie just didn't know how to end, until finally it just stops -- while we wait for the sequel, in a pretty ham-handed cliffhanger.I'll probably see the third, but I'm not optimistic.",Null,2,5,15 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," It's a fine adaptation
","In fact, I think in some ways it surpasses the original. Tilda Swinton's White Witch is, I think, a lot scarier than anything Lewis himself came up with, plus the final third of the movie has an oomph and push rather lacking from the over-schematic original. I also liked the early set-up which helps give us a sense of these characters before they enter Narnia, set the story in a place and time, and in a neat way foreshadows part of the climax.There is a certain thinness which is inescapable, a fault of the source material itself. I respect Lewis, but don't consider him an especially good writer of fiction. Narnia is a hodgepodge of myths, folktales, Christian symbolism and talking animals straight out of The Wind in the Willows. It feels contrived, not especially 'real'.But if you have any fond memories of the book at all you'll like this, it's a marvelously faithful adaptation. As for the Christian elements, they're there but it's not a dreary Sunday School lesson -- the movie's as Christian as you want it to be, essentially.",Null,1,2,17 December 2005
Oldboy," Didn't like it much at all
","Armond White of the NY Press has called it a 'virtuosic stupid movie'. I think that's exactly right.Certainly the movie looks fantastic. I liked the surrealistic touches. I think the director has a real imaginative way of capturing the process of memory -- there's an extended flashback about 3/4 way through which I think is as well conceived and shot as anything I've seen. The acting is standout. Hell, I even liked the score.But the movie almost aggressively makes no sense.SPOILERS Leave aside for a moment the obvious plot holes, large and small -- although it's worth noting that there's a whole lot of them. Leave aside the contrivances, too: the endless special gadgets the bad guy comes up with just when he needs them, the rather magical view of hypnosis, Dae-Su's magical new abilities, the seeming omnipotence of the badguy. Let's assume all this is beside the point, and that we're supposed to take the movie more or less symbolically ala FIGHT CLUB (probably the closest reference).The movie doesn't make any sense thematically, either. What's it really about? The virtue of keeping your mouth shut? The movie seems to suggest that the bad guy's sexual relationship with his sister is just fine, the problem seems to be Dae-Su's big mouth. The movie rather laboriously teaches this: the sister kills herself because of the rumors which somehow the sister believes to be true (?); Dae-Su becomes convinced that he was, in fact, at fault; Dae-Su cuts his own tongue out; Dae-Su pleads that Mi-do never learn the truth; Dae-Su even ends up brainwashing himself via hypnosis to forget the truth -- or 'keep his mind shut', in a sense. I mean, huh? This is a pretty juvenile kind of ethics, to be blunt about it. Although Dae-Su is the protagonist the movie really doesn't seem to be on his side. It also hints at a weird kind of passivity: for all of the hammer swinging and octopus eating, Dae-Su doesn't really do all that much: things are done to him, and eventually he begins to internalize the abuse given to him.Is it about the futility of revenge? One would think, particularly with the references to COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. But leaving aside the notion that Dae-Su's tormentor's omnipresence seems to weigh against the notion of him and Mi-do doing anything, really, but take their lumps or try to fight back, the fact that Dae-Su is considered by the movie to have really 'done' something makes any critique pretty complicated. Remember, in COUNT Dantes is a true innocent. His motives are as pure as revenge ever gets -- that's why Dumas's ultimate critique, his ultimate notion that revenge even for the Count is wrong works so well. The force is seen in isolation. Here, though, it seems more a case of Dae-Su learning how 'bad' he really is. He shouldn't take revenge because he really IS at fault.I guess you could argue that the movie shows revenge is futile from the bad guy's point of view. Then why are we watching Dae-Su at all? Maybe the point is that everyone feels themselves righteous until they realize the true dimensions of their 'sin'. But I don't see a lot of people facing up to facts in the movie: I see a lot of denial, in fact. Dae-Su admits to his relatively 'minor' sin but can't face up to his 'major' one.After I saw this I read some interviews with the cast and crew, and apparently some of this vagueness is intentional -- we're supposed to be left unsure. Well, the movie is successful in that, but I think it's an unworthy goal, an abdication of the artist's responsibility. People have bristled at the charge that this movie is nihilistic, but if that really is the point, that the movie's supposed to throw up it's hands and say, 'hey, I dunno, you figure it out', then that truly is nihilism.Ah well, I could go on, but I won't bore you. A virtuosic stupid movie indeed, I think: often amazing to watch but underneath the surface just a whole bunch of muddleheadedness.",Null,688,1275,24 April 2005
Spider-Man 2," Very Enjoyable (small spoilers)
","Spidey vs. Doc Ock and the usual travails of life. I'm one of the six people in America who haven't seen the original, so this was all fresh for me. I, of course, know the general mythos: Spiderman is basically a realistic Superman. He isn't just 'nerd-like', he's an authentic nerd. His boss isn't just irascible, he demeans Parker and spends his days trying to destroy Spiderman. Etc. The joke in Spiderman is that being a super-hero doesn't do much to help you in daily life. The movie is well cast. Tobey Maguire is a very fragile Spiderman: he seems bowled over by the pressures of his life. It's a very interesting portrayal -- true to the character, but different than most superhero stuff we see on the screen (who are usually larger than life). It's best dramatized by the best sequence in the movie, an abolutely knockout fight scene that starts on a skyscraper and moves to a train. (The CGI effects throughout are exceptional). The other real highlight of the movie is the script, which is thoughtful and delicately done (an odd observation, but you don't usually see restraint in a superhero movie). The movie's been compared to SUPERMAN 2, and there's a little of that, but a closer comparison, I think, is BATMAN 2, with its themes of identity and 'who's the real guy under the mask'. I've always liked BATMAN 2, but I have to say this movie is better, far more coherent and engaging (while coming to the same basic conclusion).Well directed by Raimi, who has the rare gift of poking gentle fun at his story without ever condescending to it. (The elevator sequence is priceless). Kirsten Dunst is appealing in the always-limited role of 'the girl'; Alfred Molina plays an occasionally sympathetic bad guy, and J.K. Simmons is the definitive Jonah Jameson.",Null,0,0,1 July 2004
Alexander," Deliriously Awful
","This is easily the worst movie I've seen in 2004, but it's bad in a way I thought Hollywood didn't do anymore, bad in a full-on, gonzo, over-the-top kind of fashion that actually makes it kind of 'good', or at least entertaining.Start with what must be called homosexual panic. I am sure Stone wanted to do what he saw as the 'right thing' by his story, and dramatize the bisexuality that was common in the era. But it's also true that Stone, judging by what's on screen, doesn't understand homosexuality, and is more than a little panicked by it. Thus we have the strongly implied notion that Alexander's bisexuality was directly related to an overbearing mother and a strong, distant, father, which is a notion of homosexuality that wouldn't have seemed out of place in, say, 1952, but seems more than a little quaint today. Thus we have clichéd 'pretty boys' flouncing around exaggeratedly, we have a surprising lack of male nudity, given the stated subject matter, etc. It would all be very offensive if it wasn't so ridiculous. This is like your Dad getting all down and sweaty to your rock records -- striving to be 'hip' is never anything less than funny.Add to it Angelina Jolie, who chews the scenery with some kind of weirdo Bulgarian/Romanian accent that doesn't fit with anything else anyone else is doing. Add to it Val Kilmer -- it's like he wandered in from the Viking movie down the street. Add to it my favorite love scene of 2004, between the incredibly beautiful Rosario Dawson and Colin Farrell, where they get naked and slap each other.Add to it the world's worst screenplay. Well, no, that's harsh: how about the world's most incompetent screenplay? One doesn't know where to begin -- Anthony Hopkins droning on and on and on, helpfully explaining the Meaning of It All in case we didn't get it? The incredibly clumsy flashback that occurs 3/4 through the picture and gives us the motivation for Alexander's conquests? (Why on earth was this a flashback?) Jolie 'writing Alexander' to tell 'him' (really us) what the political situation at home is? How about the fact that in an incredibly action-packed life, we only see two battles, one of which (the India one) is badly shot and ends with color freak-outs that I'm sure I remember from NATURAL BORN KILLERS? (The other battle scene is well done, but is prefaced by a lame scene where Alexander has to explain to his 'generals' -- really us -- what we're about to see.) How about the fact that there's no real theme or arc to this story, that it doesn't seem to understand how to dramatize a life and instead ticks off the major events in a sluggish, chronological way? And I'm not even touching the ridiculous use by Stone of Motifs (the Meaningful Glances between Farrell and Leto, say) or Leto, who apparently is doing Clare Daines doing a Greek warrior, or the buckets of mascara used by the cast, or Farell's dullness (is there a more overrated actor working today than Farrell?) or Kilmer's appearance as a Meaningful Ghost near the end. Etc.Unaccountably taken seriously by most critics, who've missed the boat here completely, and are giving it lackluster reviews as a result. If you understand what you're getting into -- and you have three hours to kill -- you'll enjoy it. Bring some booze, though.",Null,4,8,12 December 2004
Constantine," Fine, but will irritate fans of the series
","Fans of the series are going to be annoyed at CONSTANTINE, which casts Keanu Reeves in a paradigmatic British 'good bloke' kind of role and at times roams rather far afield from 'Hellblazer' (Constantine is not known for action, really, nor is he the kind of guy who's going to fit in well in a redemption tale, which is what the movie turns into.) That said, Reeves is not bad, especially as the story kicks into high gear and we see him trying to figure out what's going on: Reeves always does bewilderment well, and we see a lot of that. Unfortunately he's asked to be acerbic and cynical at the start, which is something he's not good at.Absolute newcomers are probably not going to like it either: I've read reviews from such folk who seem completely lost in the story's byways. It helps to have at least a general familiarity with the Vertigo aesthetic, and it's sort of oddball take on Heaven/Hell/God/Satan/Good/Evil. Probably the ideal audience is somebody like me, who followed some Vertigo series but not 'Hellblazer' specifically.I enjoyed this movie for the most part. It ultimately becomes rather conventional, and that's a problem here and there (the climax is kicked off by as ridiculous a plot machination as I've seen). There's also too much fogginess in the story: the bad guy's plot seemed to depend far too much on luck, for instance. But the effects are spectacular, the mood is nicely grim and downbeat, the trip to the conventional destinations is unusual, there's a lot of interesting Vertigo-type ideas on screen, Constantine is for the most part not much of a superhero, and while the movie ends as a redemption story, it's a complicated sort of one, which I liked. (I thought Constantine's final solution to his problem was incredibly ingenious.) In other words, I liked it despite it's faults, and would cautiously recommend it. I've heard some people call it BLADE crossed with THE EXORCIST, which actually isn't too far off -- whatever you think of 'Hellblazzer', if that notion appeals to you you'll like this.",Null,3,19,22 February 2005
Troy," Solid (Some small spoilers)
","Does anyone not know this story? Helen is supposed to be marrying the king of Sparta, but ends up running off with Paris, the younger prince of Troy. Sparta declares war, as does Greece, which has been eyeballin' Troy for some time and uses the incident as a pretext. Sorrowful anti-war war epic takes its time getting going, but after about a half-hour of self-serious throat clearing we finally get to the war and the movie catches fire. Director Petersen has a nice touch with the action sequences -- he never allows the epic sweep of his story to overwhelm the focus of the camera. (The big battle between Hector and Achilles is a highlight, well staged with some interesting fight choreography.) He also manages, for the most part, to dramatize his anti-war themes gracefully: the only exception is Brian Cox, hideously miscast as Agammemon. (Cox is a character actor who specializes in Snidely Whiplash style villains; he's fine in the right role but here he overacts outrageously, pushing things into a cartoon land that Petersen mostly manages to avoid.)
Outside of Cox, though, the performances are good. Bloom is not likable, but very believable as the spoiled pretty boy Paris. Bana is even better as Hector, who he essentially plays as an all-American type, a decent patriotic guy in a bad situation. Achilles is an impossible role, really -- he is, after all, the child of a goddess -- but Pitt manages to capture something of Achilles's essential strangeness and the petulance brought on in part by being so outstandingly beyond most men. Solid all around, except for the sleepy beginning. Recommended. With Peter O'Toole as the weary, somewhat naive King Priam and Sean Bean in a very nice turn as Odysseus.",Null,2,4,14 May 2004
Silent Hill," A Decent Stylistic Exercise
","People who complain about the plot certainly have a point, it makes little sense. But a movie like this is not really about 'making sense', it's about delivering trippy imagery. On that basis alone I can recommend this -- while not especially frightening, it's incredibly nifty to look at. If you liked HELLRAISER you'll probably like this.There are nods to the video game roots but I think they're handled pretty well, with essentially a wink and a smile -- the bit with 'memorizing the map' comes to mind.Only two complaints. First of all, the final reveal of who the bad guys are is disappointing in the extreme, painfully obvious. Ironically, the biggest weakness in SILENT HILL comes when the actual plot kicks into gear, during the only time that the story really become paramount.More importantly, I think the pacing's off. Again, it's the climax. A movie like this needs a real firework sendoff, a real visual barnburster. I found this disappointing. (The coda is nicely ambiguous, though.) Still, it's worth seeing. Especially if you think you'd like to see it, you probably should. You're already on the movie's wavelength.",Null,0,1,30 April 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Fine drama, highlighted by masterful Cheadle performance
","Obvious comparisons to SCHINDLER'S LIST can be made, and this is not the grim masterpiece that film was. This one plays it safe and conventional a bit too often, hitting discordant notes of forced Hollywood catharsis and grand moments and the like. I disliked Joaquin Phoenix's pro forma guilty white liberal, and I think Nolte was simply miscast as the impotent UN general.All that said, the movie succeeds far more often than it fails. For every wrong note there's a bunch of absolutely right ones, and some of the dramatic crescendos are riveting (the bodies on the road and Cheadle's subsequent breakdown, for instance). Those who would criticize the movie for it's conventional structure ignore the power such conventions have: an event like the Rwandan genocide is beyond any one viewer's ken to grapple with -- it is these very conventions which enable the viewer to engage with the subject matter.Cheadle is superb as the hotel manager who becomes a reluctant savior. Throughout he's a man consumed with the value of appearances; what's fascinating is we see him plausibly shift from believing in a phantasm-like symbol behind those appearances to using his skill with appearances to accomplish other, better goals. Unlike SCHINDLER's Liam Neeson, Cheadle is a real, plausible human being. I think this is the best thing he's ever done in the movies. As his wife, Sophie Okanedo does a fine job with a rather underwritten role: it's to her credit that she makes such an essentially passive character believable and memorable.Has it's faults, but mostly very fine, and shamefully does not seem to have garnered the audience in America it deserved.",Null,2,3,18 March 2005
Crash," Good first half, then loses it's way
","A God's-eye view of LA, which director Haggis sees as a place full of racial conflict and rough racial accommodation. Everyone's quick on the trigger, everyone's quick to claim victim-hood status, as well -- although the truth's a lot more complicated.The first half is great, with dialog so sparkling I almost thought it was a Tarantino flick, if Tarantino was trying to do a message movie about racial relations. The inter-cutting between the different points of view are well done, everyone gives good performances (the Larenz Tate/Ludicrous car-jackers-cum-comedy-duo being especially outstanding), and the dialog absolutely leaps off the page.The movie runs into real trouble in the second half, starting with SPOILERS Matt Damon's improbable rescue of Thandie Newton from a burning car (he had previously groped her while her husband watched in a shocking scene). One such improbability I can swallow, but then they start coming fast and furious: Larenz Tate turns out to be Don Cheadle's missing brother, Ryan Phillipe acts in a way completely contradictory to his character as set up, as does Sandra Bullock, etc. All of these forced moments seem to be designed to give the characters an Epiphanic Moment, but that's not how it works. You can't force these things -- epiphanies come naturally out of the flow of the story.What had previously seemed fresh and exciting, a unique way to talk about race in America, soon becomes ever-more contrived. It's almost as if you can feel the force of the narrative press down on them, to the detriment of the film.It's too bad, because the first half really is spectacular.",Null,1,3,6 June 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Marvelous (small spoilers)
","An Air Force General (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and orders a wing of bombers under his command to attack the Soviet Union. Marvelous satire of Cold War sensibilities. Kubrick's clinical, coolly analytic temperament serves him well here: the old quote goes 'the world is a comedy for those who think, a tragedy for those who feel' and Kubrick was definitely a thinker. He clearly sees the whole thing as one bleak, black joke and he manages to get us laughing at our own destruction, no small feat. Movie is filled with priceless comic touches, from Hayden's General, always muttering about precious bodily fluids, to Scott's womanizing General, whose secretary/girlfriend calls him in the War Room, to Peter Sellers as the wimpish President getting into a fight with the Premier of Russian on the phone, arguing about whose 'sorrier' about everything, to Sellers again, this time a British officer trying to stave off Armageddon but out of change for the pay phone (Keenan Wynn blows up a Coke machine for Sellers to get change, but warns him 'he'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company') to Sellars again (three roles!) as a Nazi War Criminal who can barely restrain his sieg heils. Not a perfect movie, a few of the jokes are pretty telegraphed, but it would be churlish to pick nits. A classic, well worth seeing.",Null,0,1,17 June 2004
Nacho Libre," Fun, though slight
","Jack Black is a friar in a remote Mexican village who deep in heart longs for the glory of the Mexican Wrestling ring. It is what it is -- a very light slapstick comedy -- but what it is ain't too bad at all. Jack Black, firmly upholding the tradition of the Goofy Fat Guy in comedy, mugs for the camera and does a lot of silly things with brio. The theme, such as it is, of not denying your gifts but using them for God, not personal aggrandizement, is an oddly sweet one, and the whole winds up in a cheerful, almost old-fashioned kind of way. Very smart movie-making from a commercial point of view, it threads the gaps between a lot of America's current poles expertly. Recommended, it's hard to know who wouldn't like this, actually.",Null,0,0,3 July 2006
The Bourne Identity," Enjoyable, Damon's great (spoilers)
","I saw this after seeing BOURNE SUPREMACY. A man who's been shot in the back three times is found floating off the coast of France (Damon). He soon discovers that his name is Jason Bourne and is some kind of superspy. The first movie is not better than the sequel, but it is different in tone. There's more of a feeling here of lightness, even amiability, and the source of that is, I think, Damon's performance. *He* is much better here than he was in SUPREMACY, mainly because there's a more natural blending of his natural, sort of boyish charm and the action. Damon often gives the sense that he doesn't understand how he's doing what he's doing, and that seems right for him, a natural fit. We also have the addition of a female here, Potente, and their relationship inevitably helps soften the mood. The story is not as sharp as it was in SUPREMACY, which is actually an extremely well-written version of the breed. As Bourne begins to unravel the mystery of his past, Treadstone sends operatives out to kill him. Much of the action is Bourne knocking them down one by one, until he knocks down Clive Owen, who gives him enough information to finally advance the plot to the climax. It's entertaining, don't get me wrong, but doesn't have the sense of inevitability that a great genre plot should.The action is superior. Whatever Greengrass gained by the extensive handheld work in SUPREMACY (immediacy, mostly) he lost with incoherence. The director here takes a much more restrained approach, and that's welcome. The Paris chase scene is better than the climactic Moscow chase scene in Supremacy, in particular, partly because we have a better sense of what's going on. I also think the final Damon/Owen fight -- the best sequence in the film, in my opinion -- is aided by relatively static shots. IDENTITY is lighter, more of a popcorn movie than the rather sad SUPREMACY. Both are worth seeing. With Chris Cooper and Brian Cox, both basically doing themselves as badguy agency officials.",Null,1,2,28 July 2004
The Village," Beautiful, Well Acted, and Dumb (spoilers)
","An Amish-styled village has an uneasy truce with 'creatures' who live in the woods surrounding them They run into trouble when Joaquin Phoenix is stabbed -- the girl he loves braves the woods to bring back medicine for him.
Beautifully shot, beautifully directed -- Joaquin's stabbing sequence is very well done for instance -- and wonderfully acted. Ron Howard's daughter is good, but I especially liked William Hurt, who underplays his role very nicely as the morally conflicted leader of the village. And absolutely stick-stone stupid.Harsh words, but I'll stick with them. This is the paradigmatic example of how a bad script, by itself, can kill a movie. All of the rest of the pieces are in place, but the story makes no sense the moment you press on it. Structured something like a 'Scooby Doo' episode, it presupposes, among other things:1. That citizens can leave modern life and talk in an absurdly stilted dialect for 24/7, with no references to anything in the outside world.2. That these unnamed citizens can get away with *all* government agencies ignoring them. No sheriffs? Social workers? Taxmen? Nobody?
3. That these unnamed citizens can actually bribe the government to reroute planes overhead, soley to keep the illusion intact.4. That no one complains when somebody dies needlessly in the village, because 'that's the deal'.5. That a modern park ranger wouldn't have more questions when a girl comes stumbling out of the woods other than 'you live in there'?
Etc.Add to that how manipulative it is, and necessarily so to maintain the illusion. That's what really bothers me about the movie: MNS has to conspire against his audience to keep things going. So, just like a Scooby Doo episode, we have 'sheds that can not open' and 'mystery boxes' that are only opened to reveal the truth of what's going on. This information is unnecessarily kept from the audience -- there's no reason in plot terms to be so coy. Unless your whole raison détre is to mess with the audience's head.The final battle with the blind girl and Noah is meaningless: it's shot like a horror movie sequence, but there's nothing scary about it. How could there be? We already know it's a guy in a suit. What's scary about that?
Scooby Doo wraps it all up in a half-hour and never takes it too seriously. This is taken incredibly serious, which only makes it worse. Ranks with VAN HELSING as the worst movie I've seen this year.",Null,0,0,4 August 2004
"I, Robot"," Not great, but okay (spoilers)
","In the future, a homicide detective (Smith) investigates the apparent suicide of the founder of robotics (James Cromwell). He has his doubts, and they flare into suspicion when he finds a strange robot lurking around the crime scene. Nothing particularly special, but a decent crime story set in the future where robots are integrated into daily life. Doesn't have a lot to do with Asimov's book, although some elements are shoehorned in. More importantly, here and there the writers manage to capture the spirit of Asimov's work -- some of the dialog has the same earnest, somewhat naive quality one associates with Asimov. Smith is not one of my favorite actors, but he rings a few interesting changes on the cliched 'rebellious cop bucking the system' role. The rest are routine, although I liked the actor they based the robot on: his voice acting, especially, is sweet and convincingly innocent.
The solution to the whodunit is somewhat surprising, although once we know the bad guy the climax becomes a retread of countless 'insane computer killing humanity to save it' stories. On the other hand, the action sequences, particularly here at the finale as our heroes race to stop The Evil Computer, are extremely well done. (The battle between robots is a highlight.) It's not exactly enough to make you forget you've seen it many times before, but it's close. Despite all the money thrown at it, this is a relatively small movie in spirit, limited in scope and ambition. I wouldn't be surprised to see a spin-off tv series a few years down the pike -- it's that kind of movie. But I still liked it. It makes sense, the story's paced well, the action is exciting and the movie poses it's questions without giving any simple answers, which was nice. A mild recommendation.",Null,0,0,17 July 2004
Van Helsing," Beautiful to Look At, but Mediocre
","In the 1880's, Van Helsing is a James Bond-type for a secret wing of the Catholic Church. Instead of fighting SMERSH or SPECTRE, he fights the Universal back catalog of monsters (Mr Hyde, a Wolfman, and most notably Dracula, who has a Bond bad-guy idea for destroying the world).The movie is absolutely beautiful to look at -- the production design is a pitch-perfect evocation of Hollywood horror movies from the Thirties and Forties, but grander -- it deserves an Academy Award nomination. The movie has been lambasted in some quarters for an over-reliance on CGI special effects, but I thought they were fun to watch, for the most part -- although the Mr Hyde is too close to the Frankenstein for comfort. The action sequences (and there are plenty) are fun to watch, too, although the final battle is disappointing:  here the critics are right, Sommers over-relies on CGI effects and quick cuts and it vitiates any sense of excitement we should be feeling.The movie *should* be criticized for an absolutely terrible script. Nobody should go into VAN HELSING expecting WAR AND PEACE, but this doesn't even meet minimum standards of quality. Dracula's evil plot is not very well explained, and I don't understand how various other characters should be fit into it. Motivations of the other characters are all over the board or inexplicable, even with painful-to-watch scenes of characters looking off into the distance and explaining them. I also could have done without scenes where characters explain the background to each other for the viewer's benefit; without silly, too anachronistic to be believed dialog (at one point VH tells somebody he does what he does for 'self-realization'); and without the obligatory hip/'cocky' rejoinders that just fell flat.
It also *should* be criticized for some pretty bad acting. Again, my standards for this kind of movie are not high, but Sommers can't even seem to meet the low bar. Jackman can be good but he's not good here -- he seems painfully wooden, like he could never figure out what tone to take. David Wenham, as The Comic Relief, is spectacularily unfunny, and Richard Roxburgh, as Dracula, is achingly bad, maybe the worst portrayal of this character I've ever seen. Only Beckinsale is good -- she has the necessary light touch for this kind of semi-schlock. I spent a lot of the movie wishing that her and Jackman had switched roles.I wanted to like this -- I like Jackman and Van Helsing was always my favorite character in DRACULA. But there's not a lot here. Avoid.",Null,0,0,8 May 2004
Jarhead," Pointless
","There's no story here -- in fact, one of the 'points' of the movie is that nothing happens. As a slice of life it's been proved inaccurate by various people who've actually served -- and even if it was accurate I'd question the point of it, since GUNNER'S PALACE works much better at filling that niche (among other things, it has the merit of being actually true, ie a documentary.) Historically, it's 'theme', that the infantry has been rendered pointless in an era of push-button war ala the Gulf War, couldn't be more out of date, as a brief glimpse at today's headlines will show. It's philosophical 'point', that man receives meaning by what he does, is pseudo-profound at best, basically just dime store dorm room philosophizing. Dramatically so much of the movie seems ripped off from better films (FULL METAL JACKET and THREE KINGS, especially) that one is left feeling like one should've rented those instead.Nicely acted, especially by Foxx. And really lovely cinematography at times, especially in the oilfire sequences. But pointless all around, should never have been a movie in the first place.",Null,1,2,16 November 2005
Collateral," Great genre piece (spoilers)
","Jamie Foxx picks up Tom Cruise, who offers him six hundred dollars to ride him around LA while he makes 'stops'. These 'stops' turn out to be hits and Cruise turns out to be a professional killer.Fantastic genre piece from a master of the form. The storyline's incredibly tight -- if you can buy a couple of early implausibilities it works like clockwork from there, which is all anyone can ask from a movie script. Mann gives LA a grainy, bleary kind of look, like a drunkard's dream. He's also very good about making what could be a relatively static, boring series of shots in Foxx's cab seem exciting.If you like HEAT, this movie somewhat riffs off the central 'duality' concept in the famous De Niro/Pacino scene. Foxx has escaped the world in dreams; Cruise has embraced nihilism. They're two sides of the same coin, and the movie ultimately is the story of how they try to connect.
Foxx has never been more likable, underplaying his role for the most part and giving us a very believable schnook. Cruise is good even in crummy movies, but he's particularly good when he plays around with his persona, and he does so to devastating effect, here. The two together have an interesting chemistry, especially as the movie draws on and a strange kind of bond starts to form between the two men.

","Bale's transformation is shocking, but in the service of what? A ridiculous, pretentious, overwrought story that seems to think throwing in Dostoevsky is somehow a sign of intellectual depth. The pov of this story is muddled beyond belief -- although clearly not in 'the real world' we are neither in lunatic land (too realistically presented) nor slowly going insane ville (as Bale's own physical appearance cuts against that; he's clearly six degrees around the bend already). Much of the symbolism is belabored and obvious -- if you haven't figured it all out by halfway through the picture, you need to see more movies -- and the actual lines are often wince-inducing. It's such a shame the acting is stellar throughout, as it seems like such a waste. I actually walked out of this, one of the rare times I've ever done that.

","Juan (Rod Steiger), a Mexican bandito, shanghais expatriate (and former IRA member) Sean (James Coburn), an explosives expert, into knocking off the Mesa Verde bank. Before he knows it, though, Steiger has gotten himself enmeshed in the Mexican Revolution.I recently saw the restored version on the big screen, and it's certainly the version to see, as previous American versions had cut this movie all to shreds. I bow to no one in my admiration for Leone, a favorite director of mine who directed my all-time favorite movie, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, but this, while pretty good, is not first rank. Part of the problem is that the early broad comedy jars, and jars pretty badly, with the later very somber seriousness. Not only that, the other part of the problem is that the comedy really isn't very funny -- Steiger isn't Wallach, who could make the broad Italian-style clownish humor of Tuco appealing. His Juan does a good crack at it, but it seems really forced to me, like Steiger's heart really wasn't in it. Things pick up in a big way once we hit Mesa Verde. While not an action-fest, there are several nice set pieces, and Leone does really good work pulling out the tension of the various explosions. (The explosions, particularly the final one, are exquisitely staged.) There are several haunting images in the second half -- soldiers gunning down innocents in trenches, Coburn watching a firing squad in the rain, Steiger ripping off his crucifix after finding his family slaughtered. The story, once we get past the cornpone, is also pretty good. Leone is pretty obviously anti-war, but the movie steadfastly refuses to take sides in the conflict. Ultimately what matters to Sean and Juan are personal solutions, personal motives. The war simply surrounds them (a theme introduced in GOOD, BAD, AND UGLY.)Steiger is better playing reluctant hero than comic clown; I think he's basically miscast here (and I like Steiger). Coburn is very good as Sean: he comes from the same laconic line as Blondie in GOOD, but this is a sad, damaged man who's laconic more as a defensive mechanism than anything else.If you're going to see it, see the restored version.",Null,2,6,25 September 2004

","A little too much recapitulation of the origin story for my taste, although the notion that Bruce Wayne learns at the feet of what are essentially terrorists is fascinating, a unique rejiggering of the moral ambiguity at the heart of the legend. Nice effort at reestablishing Batman as a fearsome figure -- Bale's scream of 'Pray to me!' was awesome, in particular. A fine cast all around, with Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow turn and Gary Oldman's definitive Jim Gordon being highlights. An interesting redesign of Gotham as a kind of incipient Third World city. A worthwhile moral logic: the villains plans make sense, as does the thread of fear and confronting fear, which weaves through the story.

There's not much of a plot, the Nolte-aphorisms sound like they came from Pat Morita in THE KARATE KID, and frankly the whole set up seems absurd to me from the get-go.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Disappointing Way to end the Series
","Actually, I don't understand why they decided to end this -- it's been profitable and there was a lot of goodwill invested in the characters after the first two. Certainly there's more interest in this than there ever was in, I don't know, an Elektra movie or something.But as a conclusion this is pretty shoddy. If you know and like the characters you'll like this -- the real pleasure of this series has been the spot-on casting throughout. The movie really rides on that, as well as the accumulated goodwill, because other than that it all feels hurried. Far too much story in far too little space: we see three major characters die, more change their roles drastically, maybe a half-dozen new characters are added on both sides, apocalyptic fights right and left (that don't go on as long as they need to). The whole thing feels really pro forma, like the movie makers weren't interested, ultimately, in it. It's very strange.There are two sizable story lines here that could've stood on their own as movies; smashing them together does nobody any good.It still has it's moments: Jackman is still wonderful as Wolverine, I think Berry is more comfortable as Storm. There's a lot of in-jokes for the fans, and even in this denuded state it's not actively awful. But it could've been a lot better -- it just feels depressing, as it stands.",Null,0,0,3 June 2006

Almost sixty years later, Hellboy is a member of an elite paranormal defense unit, along with a strange guy who looks like the Creature from the Black Lagoon's peaceful cousin, and Selma Blair, who's a pyrokinetic. They end up fighting the same group who brought Hellboy to Earth, led by Rasputin, of all people.Very entertaining story based on a comic book I've never really followed. It's carried completely by Perlman, who delivers an amazing performance underneath all of that makeup and makes what would seem like absurd situations (Hellboy battling a monster and trying to save a box of kittens), rote situations (his interactions with Hurt, who he considers a father), and hackneyed situations (his love story with Blair, made difficult by his appearance) believable and even touching.Most everybody else in the movie does a fine job as well, although I think Blair's role was somewhat underwritten and her motivations a bit opaque, especially early on.The effects are decent, although it's fair to say the action doesn't really take off. On the other hand, it's hard to know how del Toro would really sell a battle with a Lovecraft-style monster in a library in any 'realistic'. Instead, the general feeling is of amiable horsing around, essentially -- everything is kept very tongue in cheek, light.This is a very entertaining melange of Lovecraft, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and tough guy/hardboiled shtick.

Jet Li is a nameless functionary of the Emperor's who comes to the capital city to tell the Emperor that he's killed the three most dangerous assassins in the realm -- the truth, though, is something quite different. Beautiful cinematography, with a wise use of location shots. Excellent, almost etheral fight cinematography. A fractured storyline that relies on visual echoes and cinematic cues to draw the pieces together (the actual protagonist of the story isn't Li or the Emperor at all, really, but rather Tony Leung's Broken Sword). A symbolic story that resonates on many different levels: the story seems to be a poetic meditation on power, at least at first viewing. Wonderfully acted by all concerned: Leung is typically great and this might be my favorite Maggie Cheung performance. A genuine work of art, controversial to some because of the implication that this is pro-despotism. I think the truth is somewhat more complex than that, though -- one could write an essay teasing out the meanings of HERO, but let's just say it's not a simple storyline or simple propaganda.

It is, for instance, an anti-war movie, but it's not just that or simply that. Nor is it simply a glorification of war.There's an extraordinary moment in the film where it suddenly becomes quite moody and meditative, even melancholy. For a POW film it suddenly feels like a meditation on the passing of time, and things, and how life is really just a stealthy robbery of us all.There are a couple of moments that feel a bit preachy, and that's a real disappointment, as for the most part the tightrope of subtlety is walked extremely well.

Good little bits are sprinkled throughout: the Albanian floozie, the bit about what Grand Central Station really is, the moment with Owen and the kid playing video games.The spine of this is the caper story, though. It has it's moments: for once I liked the final twist, and it's tightly shot and effectively presented. Unfortunately in the end it seemed to me to be a whole hell of a lot about not much -- the basic plot here could almost be one of those dreadful CBS television movies, complete with a little moralistic ending. And that's a problem, too -- this thing just doesn't know how to end. I counted at least four false endings before it's finally put out of it's misery.That doesn't make it bad, by any means, and I would really like to see Lee try his hand again at this genre -- I think he has a natural flair for the crime genre.

Unusually hard-edged and rough, with clear references to 9/11 -- I found the usually pro-forma shots of cities being destroyed unusually powerful. Cruise is a very fallible 'hero', we never get much more than a small piece of the whole story (which I found exceptionally believable). For the most part the kids behave believably.

Man on Fire," Half of a Success -- Wait to Rent
","Ex-soldier Creasey (Washington), who has an unnamed violent and tragic past, takes a job bodyguarding Marc Anthony's little girl in Mexico City. The two bond, the girl is taken, and Washington goes on a rampage.
Not-bad crack at a tough guy action flick. Director Tony Scott, a hack who generally panders to every sort of upbeat Hollywood cliche, is here admirably grim and gritty (at least by his standards), with some graphic violence that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Seventies era Bronson movie. There's a lot of quick cuts, MTV style montages, and Fincheresque playing around with the medium (the use of subtitles) that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, but at least suggests Scott's motivated and interested this time out. Some absolutely beautiful location shooting in Mexico City, too.The plot is crap, unfortunately, and that matters more here than it did in THE PUNISHER, say, since PUNISHER was a comic book movie with no pretensions to be anything else, while this is clearly trying to aim higher. Without spoiling anything, major entities have to act in bizarre ways, major characters have to behave pretty incredibly, and minor characters have important roles but unclear motivations (partly because the information is withheld from us -- I suspect editing's at fault). I did like, though, the fact that the nature of Washington's pain is never revealed, as well as the rather sad ending. Again, that's more bracing stuff than Tony Scott normally delivers.Washington's always believable in tough guy roles, and he's good here, for the most part. Nobody does righteous rage like Washington. The movie takes it's time, mainly to set up the relationship between Washington and the girl so that the subsequent action has meaning. I understand the concept but fault the execution -- Washington does not relax very convincingly onscreen, and the bonding scenes seemed rather painful to me. The girl Dakota is sometimes okay and believable, sometimes preternaturally aware in the typical Hollywood tradition. Frankly I found her more evocative as a kind of ghost haunting Washington, than as a presence.Not bad, but probably only worth renting, where you can skip past the slow stuff and concentrate on the good sections.

","Saga of an arms dealer who gains the world but loses his soul. The movie is attempting, I think, a black comedy along the lines of THREE KINGS, but this is far less tonally controlled: I never once believed that the sardonic narrator was the same Cage as the rationalizing protagonist, nor did I believe the man we were seeing would ever surround himself with the wounded ducklings Cage did. (More irritatingly, these wounded ducklings  Cage's beautiful, hapless wife Bridget Moynihan and drug-addicted brother/sometimes partner Leto  are there just to preach the message that Arms Dealing is Bad. As though there's anyone out there who thinks Arms Dealing is Good.) This is a movie that fundamentally lacks courage, that is so intent on moralisms that it betrays it's own source material. A truly serious movie about arms dealers would no doubt be the blackest of black comedies: perhaps Hollywood isn't the place to look for that.Some good moments, a knockout opening title sequence, and a good performance from Cage make this watchable, but I wouldn't make a special trip.",Null,5,11,26 September 2005
Munich," Overrated
","This is the usual battle of Spielberg the master craftsman versus Spielberg the middlebrow thinker. Much like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the movie this in fact most resembles, it's a back and forth kind of battle. In the end MUNICH much like RYAN works better in small bits: as a whole it's failure.The movie's too long, irritatingly so. A good half hour could've been trimmed from this easily.I'm not sure what I think of Bana, I've liked him in other things I've seen of him, but he's pretty mediocre here. None of the characters we see are especially deep, but the other performers (particularly Rush and Craig) do their best with what they've got. No such luck with Bana, who's a stolid performer in the best of times.This is a movie that thinks it's a lot smarter than it really is. The main theme is probably something like 'this is all pointless', which by definition makes the revenge plot by-the-way. Which is the point, I'm sure, but it doesn't make for interesting cinema. Another way to say it is that large parts of this movie are just boring, despite all the explosions.Okay, so the themes of the movie are presumably more important. Even if we probe deeper, though, the 'argument' is overly simplistic. Once we get past the massacre itself, every Palestinian is seen as sympathetic and reasonable, while most Jews are crazy, or crooked, or naive, or creepy. The deck is ridiculously stacked, and that's not subtlety, that's comic book stuff. At the end of the movie, Spielberg and (more likely) Kushner hint at a lot of things they don't want to say outright: there are specific correspondences drawn between the terrorists and the Israelis, for instance. The validity of that point to one side, the reluctance of these two to give it a proper airing can only be considered an aesthetic failure.In a year of overrated movies, this is one of the biggest.",Null,3,8,31 December 2005
Fantastic Four," Not a bad adaptation
","Generally people were unnecessarily hard on this movie, which does what it tries to do fairly well. If you're looking for a decent Fantastic Four adaption you'll find it here: the storyline charts the origin of the group and their big nemesis, Dr. Doom.It's exceptionally well-cast: Chiklis is the definitive Ben Grimm, but even Jessica Alba, a woman who I was sure would never deliver a decent performance in her life, does okay as Sue Storm. (Not that it's an exceptionally tough role, but still.) The personal interactions are generally believable, as far as 'believable' goes in this kind of thing. The movie makers get the look right: it's bright and colorful the way the comic always was, and full of the gizmos the comic always had. And while I can't say the CGI work was standout, it's not intrusive, anyway.I can't say that this will ever be one of my favorite comic book movies, though. One of the problems, oddly, is that there's a bit too much personal interaction: a comic book movie that only has two real action sequences seems to miss the point, somehow. The second, more serious problem, isn't really the movie's fault so much as the source material: I just don't think this series has aged very well. I think people generally are looking for something different in their comic book heroes than what the F4 can really provide  there's a kind of simple innocence to these guys which I'm sure some find appealing, but frankly which I find to be rather blah. Another way to say it is that I find these guys pretty dated.Still, that's not really the movie's fault. And while I'm unenthusiastic, generally people who are fans should enjoy this.",Null,0,1,14 March 2006
Sin City," Fine adaptation of rather inferior material
","The best way to think about SIN CITY is that it's an extremely faithful adaptation -- in many ways it IS the comic book up there on screen -- of rather dumb material. Frank Miller's world here is loud and cartoonish, full of violence so graphic it ultimately becomes exceptionally silly, macho monologues that are just wincing in their tin-ear notes (easily the worst part of the movie is the dialog, often lifted directly from the books) and women who are really ridiculous fantasy figures for teenage boys: all sorts of hookers with hearts of gold or strippers who'll love you no matter what or waitresses looking for love. Really stupid.All that said, it is what it is, and it's not bad for what it is. It looks absolutely fantastic, light years beyond what SKY CAPTAIN was able to put on screen. The acting from the guys is all pretty decent: Rourke in particular is exceptional. You really believe in big IL'Marv: the fact that Rourke can make you care about his plight is pretty amazing. All the guns blazing and gratuitous nudity and cannibalistic practices and the like are entertaining, in their way. Rodriguez is a good action-cartoon director: he's particularly good at pacing, and the film never slows down. It's one quick two hours.Destined to be overrated by certain segments overimpressed by style and underimpressed by substance. Basically belongs in the hopper with KILL BILL and SHAUN OF THE DEAD, though nowhere near as good as those two movies. Okay, though.",Null,1,2,9 April 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Good, a bit overrated (spoilers)
","Jason Bourne, now in hiding in India, is framed for the murder of two CIA operatives in Berlin. Good, not great sequel boasts nice location shooting, a very tight script (with only one implausibility, a murder that's done for unclear motives), some decent acting and some good action sequences. The action sequences overrely on quick cuts: director Greengrass is rather more successful than most with this technique, so much so that I have to conclude this is a matter of style with him, not a way to camoflauge the movie's limitations. That said, I would have liked to have seen the action sequences shot more directly and unobtrusively. The final chase is good but overhyped. I still think the best recent car chase sequence in movies is in RONIN. Damon is better in the emotive scenes than he is in the more 'macho' sequences. He is aging well as an actor, though, losing that kind of 'pretty boy' aura that was limiting him before. Joan Allen plays an impressively flinty Deputy Director, Brian Cox chews the scenery as usual as one of the bad guys. The best thing about the movie is that it makes sense, it more or less hangs together. The plot takes a bit of concentration but is plausible. Damon is a realistic hero: he takes damage, he gets upset and distracted. His goals are nicely modest and he accomplishes them by the end of the story. The final fight is plausibly set up (as much as these things ever are, anyway) and is thankfully not with the main bad guy, but rather his henchman. His finale in Russia with a girl was very touching and very well done.As I said, I liked it. I consider it an above-average genre picture. I think it's easy to overrate it, though: it's not much MORE than an above-average genre picture. It's just that Hollywood seems to have lost the knack of making these kind of things.",Null,0,1,24 July 2004
Hustle & Flow," Good version of a clichéd story
","Small time pimp and drug dealer decides to screw on his courage and make a big push to become a rap star. Basically a very traditional, even corny story, tricked out in urban gear: but scrape away the pimps and hos and you're not all that far removed from something Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland might do. The performances help push the material past the clunky spots: I agree with all of the plaudits for Mr. Howard, in particular. He's a charismatic actor and he makes you feel the pain and frustration of his character's life. He helps bring life to the cliché. Movie staggers a bit in making Howard's character unusually kind and charming for a pimp and drug dealer, and structurally it's adherence to formula means it'll never go beyond a certain level. But for what it is, it's quite good, with some real nice stretches of dialog and some fine acting up and down the line. Recommended to those who like this kind of story.",Null,1,2,31 July 2005
Cinderella Man," A Throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood
","Inspirational story of James Braddock, a boxer who once was on top of the world, lost it all in the Depression, then got it all back through a series of happenstances, in the process becoming a symbol of hope for Americans still struggling through the Depression. A throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood: a straight-up, unironic, unapologetic paean to family, courage, fidelity, love, faith, hard work and the American dream. Crowe is excellent as the noble Braddock: he manages to make goodness interesting, which is not an easy thing to do. (He does it through not seeming aware of his own virtue.) The supporting cast is good, with Bierko a fine, leering Max Baer. The production design is faultless, you can almost smell the poverty depicted. The fights are well choreographed, with the final Braddock/Baer confrontation being an excellent restaging of the fight.",Null,0,0,18 June 2005
Evil Dead II," A classic, of course
","One of the greatest horror comedies ever made, the place where graphic horror and slapstick comedy intersects. Bruce Campbell gives one of the greatest performances ever in a horror movie, and when you stop to consider much of the film is just him in a one-man show the breadth of his achievement is even greater. Several bits seem to borrow heavily from 'Three Stooges' style shtick, most notably the whole bit with the possessed hand. I've read a couple of reviews where people try to look at this as though it had horrific qualities; I think that's completely wrong. I would seriously wonder about anybody who was 'scared' by this movie  and that's clearly not the intent, anyway.Movie has some marvelous uses of camera work and some absolutely classic set pieces. ('Groovy', indeed.) Raimi makes a virtue of the limitations of his budget: most of the effects are charming stop-motion stuff. The sort-of-sardonic tone throughout here has pervaded popular culture more generally, which is not always a plus but that's not the movie's fault. Highly, highly recommended.",Null,0,2,6 February 2006
