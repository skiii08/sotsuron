"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Incredibly funny!!
","This is definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! Aside from Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Spaceballs, this is THE funniest! Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp (is that his name? I'm not completely sure..) are hilarious... Before I saw this movie, I admit I was kind of... well, very afraid of drag queens. :P But this changed my opinion quite a bit! Unless you are a homophobic, I definitely suggest this movie!!! Go see it NOW!!",10,1,2,31 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," Not as good as the Mummy
","I really liked the first one, which is the only reason why I saw the Mummy returns.  I think that's one of the main reason why this movie is so popular! Not to mention that all the WWF fans saw if cuz of the Rock.. anyways! I thought it was going to be decent. I do, however, admit that the fight scenes were good and exciting and all, but there were just too many! I love fight scenes, and I love movies with lots of fighting, but this was just too much. There was no plot! No reason for it! It's like, 'Hey, I don't know who that guy is, but he looks like a jerk, so why don't I beat the crap out of him?' And since when does what's-her-name--Evie, is it?--know how to fight?! She's beating up some dude, and her son asks, 'Where'd you learn to do that, Mum?' and she says, 'I don't know!' Okay, how much more pathetic can you get?! Aside from the 'fight anyone that looks mean' bit, there was too much computer animation. I have my doubts that ANY of the movie was actually filmed in the location. Do you think they were really in the desert? No! Do you think they were really in an English city? Possibly, but I doubt it. I bet that the whole movie was shot in front of a green-screen. And then there's the final fight the Scorpion King! While the rest of the theater looked very into it, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. The thing didn't even look real! Sure, it looked similar to the Rock, but it definitely wasn't him! And why couldn't he have just come out as a MAN? Noooo, let's see if we can use our computers til they burst with hopes of making more money! Maybe the movie would sell better if the hero had to fight a half-man half-scorpion! Riiight.All in all, this movie was horrible. Don't waste your money! At the very least, wait til it comes out on video! Perhaps I'm simply comparing this to Memento which I also saw recently... compared to that this movie was shi... nevermind. Many people thought this movie was great, but those are the people who either just went for Brendan Frasier, just went to see the 'cool-looking' demon warriors, or maybe they just had nothing better to do and didn't pay any attention at all and just said it was good to make themselves seem intelligent or something. I don't know. But I do know that I DID watch it and pay good attention, and it was a brainless movie. I can't BELIEVE Brendan Frasier agreed to be in this! And I thought he had good taste...",Null,0,0,31 May 2001
