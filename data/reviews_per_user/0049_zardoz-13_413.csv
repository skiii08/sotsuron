The Rock," Incredibly Entertaining Nonsense
","Ostensibly, 'The Rock' ranks as Sean Connery's last memorable motion picture. This supercharged, high-octane, but improbable shoot'em up concerns renegade Army General who takes civilian hostages, occupies Alcatraz Prison with a small force, and threatens to fire poison rockets with deadly VX gas at San Francisco if the government refuses to bow to his demands. The FBI assigns Special Agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage of 'Con-Air') to the case, and he receives help from the only man who successfully escaped from Alcatraz. As it turns out, this brilliant individual is former British secret service agent John Mason (Sean Connery of 'Zardoz') who has been buried in the U .S. Penal system because he got his hands of all of America's top-secrets. FBI Director Womack (John Spencer) fears Mason. He sends in Goodspeed to negotiate with Mason. Naturally, Mason demands a trip into San Francisco, a meal in a sumptuous hotel, and a haircut. Eventually, a reluctant Mason leads Cage under the island, and they set out to disarm the rockets. Our heroes face a deadline as they battle their way through bowels of the prison. The Navy plans to obliterate the island if Mason and Goodspeed blow it. The first obstacle that our heroes encounter is a massacre in the prison showers when Hummel's men wipe out a squad of Navy Seals. One of the best scenes concerns a chase through the streets of San Francisco with Connery driving a Hummer. The script bristles with great lines. The music is terrific. If you watch closely, Cage's character learns how to lie during the course of the action. Michael Bay never lets the pace lag. Composers Nick Glennie-Smith and Hans Zimmer enhance the spine-tingling suspense with atmospheric music.",10,2,3,12 November 2012
The Blair Witch Project," Hype surrounds 'The Blair Witch Project,' but the payoff is a rip-off!
","First, 'Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace' qualified as a good sci-fi thriller but a galactic letdown as a prequel to the original 'Star Wars.' First-rate special effects engulfed a predictable, pretentious plot with characters whose charisma rating never scored as highly as the originals. 'Star War: Episode One' wasn't the only movie with too much hype. The second movie that generated almost as much hype in an even shorter space of time was 'The Blair Witch Project.' Independently produced on a broomstick budget for $22-thousand dollars, 'Blair Witch' aroused all sorts of curiosity. Was it based on fact or fiction? Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who co-produced, wrote, and directed this phenomenally successful horror melodrama, have changed the way that Hollywood publicizes movies. Moreover, they may have touched off a trend that will revolutionize movies as well as movie-making. In the short time that 'Blair Witch' has haunted movie houses, this game little thriller has generated over $240 million dollars! 'The Blair Witch Project' concerns three student filmmakers who vanished into the stick near Burkitsville, Maryland, in October 1994. A year after their mysterious disappearance, their film and video footage was discovered, and 'Blair Witch' reveals what happened to this ill-fated trio. The concept and the production of 'Blair Witch' should inspire anybody with a video or film camera that has movie-making ambitions. Myrick and Sanchez didn't let a paltry budget or the lack of major studio support encumber their efforts. Anybody who studies cinema can see the resemblance between this little movie and the Italian Neo-realism movement in the late 1940s after World War II. Like the Neo-realists, Myrick and Sanchez filmed 'Blair Witch' on authentic locations with no-name performers so that they film boasts more than a shred of authenticity. The lack of a budget transforms 'Blair Witch' and makes it such a promising premise. If Myrick and Sanchez haven't been compared with famous Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, who helmed the 1965 masterpiece 'The Battle of Algiers,' they should be. The controversy raging over both movies is the superb way that the filmmakers give their subject matter an added boost by making it look like a documentary.Sadly, all comparisons between Italian Neo-realism and Pontecorvo end when the lame storyline and the imbecilic characters in 'The Blair Witch Project' are considered in retrospect. Media theorists will have a heyday writing about the symbolic implications of this movie for years, but dyed-in-the-wool horror fans will find 'Blair Witch' less than satisfying. First, the storyline is predictable, lame, and improvised. Myrick and Sanchez get off to a bad start. 'Blair Witch' takes too long, even for an 80-minute movie, to get itself cranked up. Of course, enthusiasts will argue that the filmmakers are setting up the characters and the situations.Boo! These characters are as half-baked as their project. They plunge into the woods in their search for a spirited demon without any logistical support or back-up plan. Second, the characters themselves spend more time arguing than witch hunting. They aim their cameras at themselves more than at what they are searching for in the backwoods. They get themselves lost in the middle of nowhere and don't have enough sense to figure a way out. I'd have started a fire. These characters are every bit as stupid as the characters in major Hollywood epics, such as the 'Friday the 13th' and 'Halloween' franchises.Sure, 'The Blair Witch Project' stirs up considerable atmosphere, but the payoff is a rip-off. The witch is only hinted at through symbolic settings and off-camera hysterics. The constantly shaking cameras may induce motion sickness for some, but there is nothing in this movie that would scare anybody over age four. Indeed, 'The Blair Witch Project' has subtlety working for it, but subtlety will only get a horror movie so far before you want to scream: Show me the Evil! The acting is not an issue, any more than the funky looking, pseudo-16mm format that gives 'Blair Witch' a novel appearance. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have produced an interesting but deeply flawed movie that will be talked about for years. Hopefully, 'The Blair Witch Project' will inspire a new generation of low-budget, independent filmmakers. Presumably, next time Myrick and Sanchez will contrive a story that matches their cinematic gifts.",6,0,3,4 September 2008
Insidious: Chapter 2," Behind the Red Door
","Ever since Oren Peli parlayed 'Paranormal Activity' into a mega-successful franchise, horror movies shunning all traces of blood, gore, and mutilation have been the rage. The satantically-oriented 'Paranormal Activity' franchise, for example, is embarking on its fifth installment. Peli's spooky success has rubbed off on writer & director James Wan. Wan made a name of himself with the original 'Saw,' the guts-and-gore, torture-yourself franchise about a serial killer who inspires reprobates as awful as him to end their lives in a blaze of pain. After the millions of dollars that 'Saw' yielded, Wan left the remaining five 'Saw' sequels in other hands. He made 'Death Silence' and 'Death Sentence.' Neither exerted the impact of 'Saw,' and the young Malaysian director languished until Peli came along with 'Insidious.' Wan and his long-time 'Saw' collaborator Leigh Whannell teamed up again, and 'Insidious' used demoniac possession to scare up a mite more than $54 million on a $1.5 million budget. After a week in general release, 'Insidious Chapter 2' has sold enough tickets to surpass the original's life-time haul. Between the two 'Insidious' movies, Wan created another hair-raising hit with 'The Conjuring.' This white-knuckled ghost story has earned approximately $271 million worldwide. 'The Conjuring' and the two 'Insidious' epics exemplify a new breed of horror movie. They shun the blood, gore, and mutilation of hell-raisers such as the blood-sodden 'Evil Dead' remake. Indeed, Wan's 'Insidious' outings aren't designed to make you gag as hideous events unfold before your eyes. Like Peli, Wan has given spooky sagas a new lease on life. Scares are served up in the form of surprises. Goose bumps cover your forearms. Something mysterious lunges at you when you are least prepared for it. A creepy character appears out of nowhere and your blood runs cold because you were caught off guard. You may see some vile characters lurking in the background, but these ghouls won't make you empty your stomach into your lap. Virtually all the frightening stuff in the 'Insidious' franchise encourages you to use your imagination. You wind up scaring yourself because of what you didn't see rather than being frightened by prosthetic effects.If you haven't seen 'Insidious,' you're going to be lost in 'Insidious: Chapter Two.' Director James Wan's superior sequel resumes where his original ended and provides more thrills and chills. Predictably, the unlucky Lambert family encounters more of the unknown that lies on the other side described simply as 'the Further.' This 'Further' is a Purgatory of sorts where the tortured souls of the dead wander without a hope. Basically, demons want to appropriate your physical body in the 'Insidious' movies. They struggle to oust you from your flesh so they can occupy your skin. Some people are gifted with the ability to project themselves into an astral dimension while their bodies rest in an apparent coma. Imagine what might occur if you went to sleep and left the door to your house or apartment standing wide open? Young Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) has been able to project himself onto an astral plane. During one outing in the other world, Dalton got lost while his body lay in a coma for all practical purposes. Renai (Rose Byrne of 'Bridesmaids') and Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson of 'Watchmen') are at a loss to explain their son's predicament. Initially, they believed that their house was haunted so they moved but Dalton's condition didn't improve. Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey of 'Beaches') ushers in an old friend, Elise Reiner (Lin Shaye of 'Snakes on a Plane'), who specializes in paranormal investigation. Two assistants, Specs (Leigh Whannell of 'Saw') and Tucker (Angus Sampson of 'Razor Eaters'), who sketch, record, and photograph things for Elise, accompany her to the Lambert residence. Elise relieves everybody when she informs them that Dalton is not comatose. We learn that Josh wandered on the astral plane, too, during his youth. Elise puts Josh into a trance and he confronts demons in the Further that resemble a cross-between demonic clowns and 'Star Wars' villains. Eventually, Josh succeeds in bringing his son back to life. Unfortunately, while Josh has been acting like a responsible parent, a demon has entered his body and controls him. Just as 'Insidious' appears to end happily ever after, Josh strangles Elise while Renai, Lorraine, and Dalton sit in the next room without a clue about what is happening. As 'Insidious: Chapter Two' opens, the Lamberts have moved in with Lorraine, and the police have launched an investigation into Elise's murder. The sequel takes us into Josh's past when he met Elise for the first time as a youth haunted by the apparition of a woman in a veil. Lorraine discovered this phenomenon after she snapped several pictures of her son and noticed a mysterious lady in the background. The history of that elusive dame that has tormented Josh constitutes the bulk of scenarist Leigh Whannell's screenplay.Essentially, like its predecessor, 'Insidious: Chapter Two' is spooky version of the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sagas with demons that are far less aggressive than Freddie Kruger with his razor-sharp claws. Nevertheless, Wan and company rely less in depicting events in a way that sickened audiences in the 'Nightmare' franchise. People sitting and standing in rows with white sheets draped over them will make your goose bumps rise. Just as the original had things that lunged out at you, 'Insidious: Chapter Two' never misses a chance to startle you with its revelations. Unlike many horror movies, the 'Insidious' franchise doesn't deploy false alarms as a part of their scare strategy. Some horror movies go to outlandish lengths to set up a scary situation and then disappoint when they didn't pay off with a scream what they set up with dread. The woman that haunted Josh in 'Insidious' comes after him with everything that she can muster in 'Insidious: Chapter Two.' Predictably, the ending serves to anticipate Chapter Three.",10,1,3,22 September 2013
Whip It," Roller Heroines!!!
","Drew Barrymore made a corker for her freshman effort! 'Whip It' is all about empowering women and this is the best roller blade movie ever. Everything seems to come together without a flaw as Ellen Page heads up an all-star cast and the casting and performance really make this movie memorable, whether it is Daniel Stern as our heroine's father or Kristen Wigg as Maggie Mayhem, there isn't a bad performance. Ellen Page is terrific as a high school girl who just cannot seem to find her niche in life. Of course, her mom has her sights set on her lovely daughter becoming a beauty pageant queen so she can land a good husband, get into a great college, and enjoy the benefits of a well-earned life. However, beauty pageants are NOT a part of Bliss Cavander's agenda in life. The minute that she spots three gals careening into a thrift/head shop in Austin, Texas, Bliss knows what she wants to do is roller blade. Sadly, this inspirational little sports epic didn't generate stellar box office receipts, but it is worth watching for its oddball characters and its general thematic material. Sport movies fall into two types: those where the team is triumphant against overwhelming odds and those where the team isn't as successful against overwhelming odds. 'Whip It' occupies the latter category.",10,1,5,30 January 2012
The Avengers," One of the Best Super Hero Epics!!!
","Since the epilogue in 'Iron Man' (2008) when Nick Fury broached the idea of the Avengers Initiative to wisecracking Tony Stark, Marvel Comics has been patiently whetting our appetites for 'The Avengers.' This imaginative ensemble epic assembles not only Iron Man and Hulk, but also Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. Agent Phil Coulson is back, too. Ostensibly, these paragons of virtue are all that stand between Thor's scheming step-brother Loki and the fate of mankind. Happily, Loki brings more to the table than he did in Kenneth Branagh's anemic 'Thor.' Indeed, Thor and Loki seem to have matured considerably during the interim. Loki ranks as a first-rate villain; he is ready, willing, and eager to kill anybody who confronts him, and actor Tom Hiddleston relishes every moment. Ultimately, 'The Avengers' qualifies as Marvel's ambitious attempt to deliver an all-star, no-holds-barred, alien invasion thriller to rival both 'Independence Day' and 'Transformers' franchise. Of course, we know that our heroes won't capitulate, but this 142-minute, PG-13 extravaganza takes everything down to the wire. Inevitably, the extraterrestrial villain--only hardcore Marvel Comics fans may recognize him—who boasts about subjugating Earth is as presumptuous as audiences who fail to appreciate the artistry of 'The Avengers.' Unlike other ensemble pieces—like the venerable 'Star Trek' movies that always relegated some regulars to obscurity, 'The Avengers' gives everybody a chance to perform an integral part in this larger-than-life smackdown. Reportedly, 'Serenity' director Joss Whedon shot more footage of Captain America than reached the screen. Nevertheless, the fish-out-of-water, World War II hero still participates in a major way. Melodramatic, with more humor than you might imagine, but just enough tragedy to make things bittersweet, 'The Avengers' doesn't wear out its welcome. Moreover, this far-fetched nonsense holds up under repeated showings. I've seen it four times, and it loses none of its spontaneity.'The Avengers' opens with audacious Asgardian exile Loki (Tom Hiddleston of 'Archipelago') cutting a deal with malevolent aliens elsewhere in the galaxy and then appropriating a formidable source of energy, the Tesseract, from Nick Fury's (Samuel L Jackson) SHIELD outfit. If you're interested, the Tesseract showed up initially in 'Captain America, the First Avenger.' Once Loki gets his power-hungry hands on the Tesseract, he plans to unlock a portal in space with the expertise of Professor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård of 'Thor') so an extraterrestrial horde, the Chitauri, can invade Earth. The Chitauri are reptilian warriors with humanoid body structure in silver armor that cruise the skies as trios in chariots. Along the way, Loki recruits Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner of 'The Hurt Locker') to do his evil bidding with the help of his glowing scepter. Meanwhile, Fury recruits his own team, first persuading Steve Rogers (Chris Evans of 'The Fantastic Four') who has not quite grown accustomed to the 21st century to join him. Chiefly, Captain America doesn't know what most of the popular phrases mean. Former Russian spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) heads off to Calcutta to round up Dr. Banner. Eventually, Iron Man shows up, too. Thor barges him when he discovers that Loki is up to no good. Everybody boards a futuristic aircraft carrier that does more than ply the seas. Whedon does a masterly job of interspersing comedy with drama. Moreover, he manages to ante up enough time for each hero to make a contribution as they struggle to defeat Loki.Whedon's 'The Avengers' emerges as the climax to several recent Marvel Comics super hero escapades. Thor and Captain America toplined their own respective origins stories and generated well over a $100-million in box office receipts. If you've been keeping track of Marvel movies, you know the least successful super hero of the quartet is the Hulk. Unlike 'Iron Man,' 'Thor,' and 'Captain America,' the pugnacious green gargantuan never formulated the right mix of leading actor, atmosphere, and narrative tone. Marvel's two 'Hulk' movies failed to forge a charismatic hero after Marvel's major success with him on prime time television. Director Ang Lee's 'Hulk' (2003), with Eric Bana as the title character, took itself far too seriously and tackled unpleasant issues such as child abuse. Marvel rebooted the character with director Louis Leterrier's 'The Incredible Hulk' with Edward Norton as the eponymous character. This adventure surpassed 'Hulk,' but remained half-baked. Unfortunately, actor Edward Norton feuded with the studio over the film's interpretation of the material. Happily, for Hulk, lightening strikes the third time. Mark Ruffalo looks ideal as Dr. Bruce Banner and Whedon literally has remade the Hulk in Ruffalo's own image. Hawkeye and The Black Widow aren't exactly in the same league with luminaries like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, or Hulk. These two are conventional agents of SHIELD with special skill sets. Neither, however, possesses Herculean prowess. Lastly, ubiquitous Agent Phil Coulson hasn't changed an iota. Like Nick Fury, Coulson has appeared in most of the films. More than any other character, Coulson makes the greatest impression in 'The Avengers' when Loki throws down the gauntlet.There are two kinds of super hero movies. First, you have the brawny, exciting sagas, with sparkling verbal repartee, like 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America,' that are lightweight and exhilarating. Second, like 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight,' you have those that are dark, literate, complicated, and rely as much as possible on realism. 'The Avengers' belongs to the first category, and Whedon's opus ranks as one of the best. The action never sacrifices its momentum for expository information about any of the heroes. Iron Man has lost none of his quirky, anti-heroic personality. Captain America is still as straight as one of Hawkeye's arrows. Hulk acquires a mystique lacking in prior incarnations, and Thor becomes the hammer wielding equivalent of an intergalactic lawman. Again, Loki's machinations keep thing interesting. 'The Avengers' is the kind of movie where you need to stick around even as the end credits roll to learn more about the villains and the heroes.",10,4,11,13 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' is a lot of hush hush half-witted fluff!
","The first 'National Treasure' (2004) movie qualified as a predictable potboiler that was fast, furious, frivolous fun. The sequel 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' is just plain frivolous. Nicolas Cage heads up a seasoned cast, including Jon Voight, Ed Harris, Helen Mirren, Bruce Greenwood, and Harvey Keitel, that looks like they had a blast. If watching other folks have a heck of a lot of fun on the big-screen turns you on, then 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' will delight you. Unfortunately, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' lacks virtually everything that good action-adventure movies boast. You won't find many suspenseful scenes that are realistic enough to make you squirm at the edge of your seat. Everything here resembles a carefully contrived amusement park thrill ride. When all is said and done, the heroes, villains, and sidekicks engage in an endless game of musical chairs. In fact, the entire movie looks like an episode taken from producer Jerry Bruckheimer's CBS-TV series 'The Amazing Race.' Basically, the principals scramble breathlessly across Europe, on a harebrained scavenger hunt for clues that bring them into contact with several famous places or high-ranking people, such as the President of the United States. Moreover, you know that nobody is going to get die or get seriously hurt, except perhaps the dastardly devious villain. Worse, you know a movie like 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' is second-rate when the cartoon shown before it is more amusing than anything in this rated PG, 130 action-adventure comedy of errors. Right, the best thing about 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' is the Walt Disney Studios' cartoon about Goofy and his arduous antics to assemble a high-definition television set within the confines of his modest home.'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' should have been subtitled 'Books of Secrets.' Villainous Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris of 'Apollo 13') uses a missing page from presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary to implicate an ancestor of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage of 'Next') and his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight of 'Heat') as the mastermind behind the Lincoln's assassination. Naturally, our overgrown Hardy Boys heroes don't take kindly to Wilkinson's smear tactics. They embark on a race for clues that will clear their ancestor of this accusation. Some audiences, especially around these parts, may take offense at the way that 'National Treasure' director Jon Turteltaub and scribes Cormac & Marianne Wibberley, try to rekindle the flames of Southern hatred with a plot gimmick that involves a secret Confederate society. Along the way, Ben breaks into restricted parts of Buckingham Palace with his estranged archivist girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger of the first 'National Treasure') and their computer savvy, comic-relief sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha of 'Failure to Launch') so that they can ransack antique desks and then run rings around British security personnel. At another point, Ben and company make monkeys out of the U.S. Secret Service when our protagonist kidnaps the President (Bruce Greenwood, who played JFK in the Kevin Costner thriller 'Thirteen Days') during a ceremony at George Washington's estate at Mount Vernon. Ben has to separate the President from his bodyguards long enough to learn the whereabouts of the Chief Executive's Book of Secrets. This apocryphal reference book about nation's paranoid secrets is concealed in the Library of Congress. Eventually, the trail takes Ben and company to the Black Hills of South Dakota and Mount Rushmore. Along the way, Ben's father Patrick has to reconcile with Ben's mother, his ex-wife, Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren of 'Prime Suspect') who helps them decipher obscure Native American symbols. These reconciliations between Ben and Abigail as well as Patrick and Emily never generate much mirth.'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' isn't half as good as its predecessor. Moreover, some of its scenes have been cloned from other recent movies. The backwards car chase in London looks suspiciously like the backwards car chase from the slightly better but just as objectionable The Da Vinci Code.' The writers took the dialogue almost word-for-word about those paranoid national secrets straight from another Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster, 'The Rock' (1996) with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. The biggest set-piece occurs at the climax of the action with our heroes, heroine, sidekick, and villain atop an implausible giant spinning waffle iron contraption that looks like something out of the 1980 'Flash Gordon' extravaganza. What few historic facts and stories that come up in the plot could be found in the trivia section of any college textbooks, especially the phrase about mud. Altogether, if you're looking for lightweight, disposable fare to forget about the moment you hit the exit door, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' is superb. The first 'National Treasure' movie coined over $347 million worldwide so it was inevitable that Bruckheimer would produce another installment.",3,19,30,25 December 2007
Angels & Demons," 'Angels & Demons' Surpasses 'The DaVinci Code'
","'Apollo 13' director Ron Howard's 'Angels & Demons' qualified as a 100 times better than its predeccesor 'The DaVinci Code' and the surprises kept piling until the very end. Hanks' co-starlet Ayelet Zurer isn't very pretty and she has a rough-hewn appearance. There are no romantic interludes between them, but everybody else in the cast was terrific, including Ewan McGregor as the priest and Stellan Skarsgard as the Vatican police chief. The villain is a lethal S.O.B. who is a crack shot with a silenced automatic pistol and displays no qualms about killing Italian cops even after he has disarmed them. He gets his just comeuppance in the end. The helicopter scene at the end is unrealistic like much of the movie but it is utterly entertaining with some interesting Vatican lore thrown in for good measure. Director Ron Howard generates lots of hair-raising suspense, especially in the Vatican archives and later on toward the end with the shoot-outs. None of the stupid things that marred the first movie occur in 'Angels & Demons.' In other words, the villain doesn't try to shoot the hero from a few feet away and miss him. Tom Hanks gives another polished performance.",9,2,8,7 June 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not As Much Fun as the First One
","Quentin Tarantino has got talent, but he whipped up so much frenzy with 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' that there was no way that he live up to what he had started in 'Kill Bill, Volume 2.' 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1' has more artistic merit that the second half. For instance, Tarantino never showed Bill in a full shot in the first half. Obviously, the 'Pulp Fiction' director was treating his chief villain like the early Blofeld in the James Bond thrillers that didn't show the villain until 'You Only Live Twice.' In the first half of 'Kill Bill,' our heroine--Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman)survives an attempt on her life. We know that the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad turns out for her wedding rehearsal and mowed down everybody in a barrage of gunfire. However, this singular event was never shown. The discretion that Tarantino exercised in 'Bill 1' distinguishes it from the lack of discretion that he depicted in the follow-up. Indeed, he doesn't show this homicidal quartet actually perforating everybody in the chapel. Nevertheless, aside from showing the scene as a necessity, this is basically the only thing that he does that doesn't follow the chronology.'Kill Bill, Volume 1' surpasses 'Kill Bill, Volume 2' because the demise of O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green are more interesting than the deaths of Budd, Elle Driver, and Bill. Nothing in this half compares with the outrageous swordplay at the House of Blue Leaves. Furthermore, none of the villains in the second half are as memorable as O-Ren. You can almost share of sympathetic tear for O-Ren because she worked up way up to a position of prominence in the Tokyo underworld. Budd and Elle Driver qualify as sadistic louts. The Bride (Uma Thurman) doesn't even kill Budd. Indeed, Elle Driver kills him when she stashes a venomous black mamba in a red piece of luggage that contains a million dollars in $100 dollar bills. The fight scene in 'Kill Bill 2' is a reversal of the fight scene in 'Kill Bill 1.' Instead of staging an over-the-top combat sequence in a spacious restaurant, Tarantino choreographs a demolition scene fracas in a trailer. While it is imaginative, it seems more claustrophobic and exciting. Unlike O-Ren, neither Budd nor Elle Driver have anything approaching a back-story. He is a drunk and she is a sadistic bitch. The rewards of 'Kill Bill 2' are the scenes at Pei Mei's place where The Bride learns how to punch her way through wood as well as a special punch that later enables her to kill Bill. Compared with its predecessor, 'Kill Bill 2' looks and sounds more like a Tarantino film because the dialogue sounds more like 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Unfortunately, again, the characters are not as interesting. You never really hate Bill who comes off as more charismatic. Nevertheless, 'Kill Bill 2' is worth watching and studying for its narrative structure of setting up things and paying them off. The homages abound and Tarantino indulges more in his penchant for making references to other movies.",7,3,6,7 June 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Above-Average But Dreary 'Hunger Games' Sequel
","As much as 'The Hunger Games' and 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' captivated me, I'm less than elated that Lionsgate has split the final novel of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy into two movies. Watching 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1' is like watching half of a good movie. Worse, Lionsgate plans to make audiences wait for another year before they fold this franchise. Of course, the 'Harry Potter' and the 'Twilight' franchises made a mint with this shrewd strategy, so it's no surprise Lionsgate, the same studio that released the 'Twilight' epics, would not pass up such an obvious opportunity. As fastidious and well-made as 'Mockingjay Part 1' remains, all 'Catching Fire' director Francis Lawrence and scenarists Peter Craig of 'The Town' and Danny Strong of 'The Butler' have done is produce a potboiler that simmers more often than sizzles for two hours and three minutes. Indeed, this qualifies as the shortest entry in 'Hunger Games' franchise. Comparatively, 'The Hunger Games' clocked in at 142 minutes, while 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' edged it out at 146 minutes. The way they've made 'Mockingjay Part 1,' we see more of Katniss Everdeen and Plutarch Heavensbee than President Snow, Haymitch Abernathy, Gale Hawthorne, Effie Trinket, Finnick Odair, Caesar Flickerman, and Johanna Mason. Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence spends more time shedding tears than shooting arrows. Indeed, she shoots only one arrow in this installment. Making the most of his handful of scenes, a gleefully wicked Donald Sutherland delivers the best line: 'Miss Everdeen, it is the things we love most that destroy us.''The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1' picks up the plot after Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright of 'Casino Royale'), and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin of 'The Quiet Ones') have been rescued. Unfortunately, the treacherous Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman of 'Doubt') and the resistance have failed to liberate Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson of 'Red Dawn'), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone of 'Sucker Punch') and Annie Cresta (Stef Dawson of 'Manhaters') in the aftermath. Meantime, Katniss and her traumatized companions are recuperating from their tribulations in District 13, but our heroine doesn't know if Peeta managed to survive Panem's third Quarter Quell. If you haven't seen 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,' you may be at a disadvantage. Eventually, she learns that Peeta is alive, but he is being held in the Capitol by President Snow. Plutarch and District 13 President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore of 'The Big Lebowski') convince Katniss to serve as their standard-bearer for the rebellion. They need her 'anger-driven defiance' desperately to shore up the sagging support among the other districts in the wake of District 12's annihilation. Remember, Katniss, Peeta, and Gale Hawthorne all (Liam Hemsworth of 'The Expendables 2') grew up in District 12.The action alternates between above ground and below ground. The above ground scenes where either Katniss or the rebels battle the enemy provide the most excitement. The scenes below ground in District 13's deeply entrenched bunkers, where Katniss agonizes over poor Peeta's ordeal, constitute classic, four-handkerchief, hand-wringing, chick flick fodder. Worse, the scenes involving the secret mission to snatch Peeta from under Snow's nose yield only a modicum of suspense. Nevertheless, as static as this sophomore sequel is, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1' easily surpasses the half of the novel that it depicts without sacrificing much source material fidelity. Essentially, 'Mockingjay Part 1' combines elements of a war movie with a love story. The war story sequences generate fewer thrills than the tournament sequences in the two previous outings, while the scenes between a love-sick Katniss and a tortured Peeta are histrionic in every negative sense of the word. Katniss wanders around and whines, while a visibly wretched Peeta looks woebegone and far away. These scenes are as dreary as the air-raid sequence is tedious. The scenes of the lumberjacks scrambling up trees to avoid being massacred by President Snow's trigger-happy soldiers and later the assault on the dam are sensational, but these scenes cannot compensate from the loquacious inactivity during the subterranean sequences. The new characters that flesh out the action are fresh, but they lack charisma, while the regulars have been confined largely to the sidelines in cameos. Of course, each will play a larger part in the second half. Mind you, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' looks terrific. The producers have blown a bundle on every scene. The destruction of the District 5 dam is nothing short of spectacular, with a chorus of suicidal heroes storming a gauntlet of soldiers to detonate crates of explosives. The concrete mountains of rubble, twisted metal, and skeletons galore in District 12 appear thoroughly convincing, too. Philip Messina's production designs, Larry Dias' set decoration, and the art direction by Andrew Max Cahn, Lauren E. Polizzi, David Scheunemann, Steve Summersgill, and Dan Webster enhance the atmosphere and credibility of the film. The sumptuous looking sets and slick production values, however, don't offset the film's sluggish pace. Basically, nothing groundbreaking happens in 'Mockingjay Part 1.' The best scenes occur in the final moments, while most everything else serves as expository filler. Indeed, you know neither Katniss nor Peeta are in jeopardy. In other words, neither are going to die, and what happens to Peeta is the equivalent of having a regular series character slip into a coma while the filmmakers pause the plot to conjure up suspense. Altogether, neither Lawrence nor his scenarists have done anything in 'Mockingjay Part I' other than delay the inevitable. The hospital bombing sequence, the air raid scene, Katniss' propaganda speeches to arouse the other districts as well as singing a song are dreary. Jennifer Lawrence has a few good lines. Unfortunately, when she isn't decked out in her combat fatigues with a bow and arrow in her fists, she doesn't cut the mustard. Lawrence looks ridiculous in her baggy uniform, and Julianne Moore actually upstages her. Hopefully, Lionsgate is saving the best for 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2.'",7,1,11,8 December 2014
Black Swan," 'The Turning Point' Meets 'The Twilight Zone'
","Best known for 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'The Wrestler,' director Darren Aronofsky is no slouch when he sets out to fashion an edge of the seat thriller. Not only has he created an entertaining, first-rate film with tons of ambiguity, but he has also assembled a top-flight cast for his tense exercise in suspense about a young, ambitious, but repressed ballerina. Imagine 'The Turning Point' meets 'The Twilight Zone' and you'll have a good idea what is in store for you. Good performances, atmospheric cinematography, and spine-tingling editing bolster this quirky, offbeat film.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman of the second 'Star Wars' trilogy) finds herself considerably conflicted when she discovers that she may replace legendary dancer Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder of 'Heathers') who has starred in every ballet production. You don't have to know anything about ballet to appreciate this surprise-laden saga with the many twists and turns in a sophisticated screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andrew Heinz, and John McLaughlin. When Nina is facing competition with Beth, she finds herself attracted and seduced by a new dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis of 'The Book of Eli') who introduces the shy Nina to drugs and nightclubs. The most villainous personage is neither Big Apple ballet company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassell of 'Ocean's Twelve') nor Nina's strange mom Erica (Barbara Hershey of Beaches) who keeps a tight leash on her daughter. Instead, Nina's worst enemy is herself and she often sees herself as the Black Swan.Although some of the behavior in it might be offensive to prudish folks, this R-rated movie contains nothing in the way of nudity either upper frontal or lower bottom. Natalie Portman is terrific as Nina. Mila Kunis is her rival for the affections of the manager, (Vincent Cassel), who runs the ballet company. This nightmare thriller will keep you guessing right up to the last second and even then you won't be 100 percent sure what has happened. Winona Ryder co-stars along with Barbara Hershey. Believe me, it isn't just another dance film.The ending isn't exactly a happy one, but Black Swan is a genuine chiller that will grip you for every minute of its 108 minutes.",10,4,9,1 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," More Tedium Than Treasure
","The fourth installment in Walt Disney's profitable 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' succeeds admirably in delivering less than the previous entries. Clocking in at 136 minutes, this 'Pirates' sequel ends eight minutes shy of the original 'Curse of the Black Pearl' which lasted 143 minutes. Further, 'On Stranger Tides' runs about a quarter of an hour shorter than the first 'Pirates' sequel 'Dead Man's Chest.' Comparably, 'On Stranger Tides' is 30 minutes shorter than the bloated third installment: 'At World's End' which wore out its welcome at 169 minutes. Alas, brevity doesn't salvage this shipwreck. Oscar-nominated 'Chicago' director Robert Marshall and perennial 'Pirates' scribes Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio blew a $250 million budget but what they've forged is largely forgettable. Indeed, the dire lack of imagination on the part of Elliot and Rossio, Marshall's second-rate choreography, and the overall shortage of spectacle sink this saga. Although it proceeded with their respective blessings, neither Keira Knightley nor Orlando Bloom reprised their roles as Elizabeth Swan and William Turner. They knew when to say enough.Basically, 'On Stranger Tides' navigates tamer tides. Elliot and Rossio introduce two new characters, the infamous Blackbeard (Ian McShane of HBO's 'Deadwood') and his plucky daughter Angelica Malon (Penélope Cruz of 'Vanilla Sky'), and they serve primarily as villains who propel the plot. People who love the 'Pirates' franchise may spot some familiar faces, including Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa, Kevin McNally as Mr. Gibbs, Damian O'Hare as Gillette, Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father Captain Teague, and Greg Ellis as Lieutenant Theodore Groves. Familiar faces, two fresh characters, and a different plot don't save this scurvy saga. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' amounts to a paycheck movie. Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done little more than flog a franchise to see how much longer they could drag things out. Little about this third sequel, including Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, is entertaining. The mermaids are the only redeeming feature, but they cannot compare with the zombie sailors that trod the ocean floor in the original 'Pirates.' The race for the Fountain of Youth that motivates Blackbeard, King George, and the Spanish doesn't compensate for the clichés in Elliot and Rossio's briny script.The action weighs anchor when Spanish fishermen net a geezer who knows something about Ponce de Leon's fabled Fountain of Youth. This opening gambit in Cadiz, Spain, generates minimal anticipation. The next scene in London, England, ratchets things up as Captain Jack rescues one of his crew, first-mate Mr. Gibbs, from a hanging. Everybody thinks poor Gibbs (Kevin McNally of 'Valkyrie') is Captain Jack, and they are dying to see his neck stretched. Improbably, Sparrow cavorts about in a powdered wig and impersonates a British judge to get Gibbs off the hook. Of course, Jack and he don't get far before the authorities nab them. Jack is hustled off to see King George (Richard Griffiths of 'Gandhi') and the monarch wants him to lead an expedition so that the British to beat the Spanish to the Fountain of Youth. Jack escapes from George's clutches. Jumping from a high window, our hero lands on a moving carriage, slips inside long enough to nibble a noble woman's ear (Judi Dench in a cameo), and steal her ear-ring. Bounding back atop the vehicle, he staggers and finds himself straddling two carriages as each careens along a thronged thoroughfare. Considering director Rob Marshall's award-winning background as a choreographer, nothing Jack does in this frenzied scene qualifies as either nimble or new. Predictably, Captain Jack scrambles from one scrap to another. All this leaping and lunging creates neither hysteria nor humor. At one point, Elliot and Rossio have Jack fencing with himself in a spin on the famous Marx Brother's 'Duck Soup' (1933) mirror pantomime as Jack encounters his leading lady. As an introduction to Angelica, who masquerades as Jack, these sword fighting antics mark a slight improvement, but nothing compared to the original 'Pirates' when Jack sparred with William Turner. Naturally, Jack is searching for a ship and a crew. Fortuitously, Jack's dear old dad, Captain Teague (Keith Richards in a cameo), thwarts a lone British soldier from shooting him in the back. Eventually, Jack sets sail against his will with Blackbeard and company aboard the 'Queen Anne's Revenge,' where Jack discovers that his old ship 'The Black Pearl' has been shrunk to fit in a bottle. You see, Blackbeard practices Voodoo. Meanwhile, Jack's treacherous nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush of 'The King's Speech'), plies the seas in pursuit, but cares nothing for the Fountain of Youth. Specifically, Barbossa wants to exact revenge on Blackbeard for taking not only 'The Black Pearl' but also his leg. Like most hidden treasure quests, 'On Stranger Tides' sends the heroes and villains off on a scavenger hunt. One of the items is a mermaid's tear. The scene where Blackbeard's sailors fish for mermaids is the most original splash that this soggy yarn offers. Believe me; you've never seen mermaids like this lot. Marshall and his writers confine the action largely to terra firma with our heroes and villains plunging through jungles and caves. As Captain Jack, Johnny Depp wears his eye-liner as thick as always and flails about like a drunkard struggling to maintain his equilibrium. Sadly, Depp adds little depth to his mischievous miscreant that we haven't seen before. Ian McShane looks every inch the part of Blackbeard, but he rarely gets a chance to chew the scenery. Hans Zimmer's exhilarating orchestral score from the original imparts greater momentum than anything that either Marshall or his scenarists conjure up for this third sequel. A romantic subplot between a missionary (newcomer Sam Claflin) and a mermaid (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) gets lost in this PG-13 shuffle.Altogether, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' runs the franchise aground on a reef of déjà vu.",5,1,2,14 June 2011
Men in Black 3," Black From The Past
","'Men in Black 3' may be Tommy Lee Jones' last 'Men in Black' movie. The Oscar winning 'Fugitive' actor makes what amounts to a glorified cameo in the second sequel. He shows up for about fifteen minutes during the first act of this amusing, but tonally uneven farce and then disappears until about the last ten minutes of act three. Presumably, Jones wasn't agile enough to impersonate himself as a younger man in act two of this lively sequel. Consequently, 'Men in Black' director Barry Sonnenfeld cast Josh Brolin as a younger Agent K for the contrived time travel plot in 'Tropic Thunder' scenarist Etan Cohen's inventive but convoluted screenplay. Things seem considerably more realistic in 'Men in Black 3' as the vengeful villain takes advantage of time travel to trip back to July 1969 and knock off Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) mere moments before the historic Apollo Moon launch. Meaning, since Agent K would no longer exist, Agent K couldn't have recruited Agent J. Remember, in 'Men in Black' (1997), Agent K recruited plainclothes NYPD detective James Darrell Edwards III (Will Smith of 'Independence Day') for his fleet-footed pursuit of an alien. 'Men in Black 3' takes some outrageous liberties with time travel that haven't been handled in such a zany fashion.Basically, 'Men in Black 3' resembles the 1946 classic 'It's A Wonderful Life' (1946) where James Stewart learns about the chaos that will ensue if he commits suicide. Unlike the James Stewart hero, Agent K must survive a murder attempt on his life or chaos will engulf Earth. A buffed-up Mick Jigger look-alike bad man named Boris the Animal has dreamed about killing Agent K. Bad-tempered Boris is an alien who has goggles instead of eyeballs, gnarly-looking teeth, a Darth Vader baritone voice, and multi-toed feet and harbors a crab-like critter in his hand. He likes to discharge deadly thorns from his hand, and his trademark line of dialogue is 'Let's agree to disagree.' Unless Agent J can run interference for Agent K, the world as we know it is doomed. It seems that Agent K was instrumental in averting an alien invasion of Earth with a small gizmo that gives off an emerald glow. He has to plant it atop the Apollo Moon rocket so it can be boosted into outer space. Of course, Boris both before and after the Lunar Max escape turns up to complicate Agent K's efforts. They battle like titans atop the gantry as the launch countdown reaches the two minute warning mark.'Men in Black' opens in Lunar Max, a maximum security prison on the Moon, built to confine the worst scum in the galaxy. Beastly Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement of 'Dinner for Schmucks') thwarts an army of heavily armed guards with the help of a woman carrying a pink cake, and manages to break out. Just when the guards think they have Boris cornered, this larger-than-life villain surprises them with a stunt that staggers the imagination. Now, freed after 40 years of captivity, Boris decides to pay back the man who not only put him behind bars but also blew off part of his left arm. Of course, Boris' quarry is none other than resourceful Agent K. Agent K's only regret is that he didn't ice Boris when he had a chance. Mysteriously, Agent K vanishes without a trace, and Agent J gets the shock of his life at MiB Headquarters when he learns that Agent K has been dead for 40 years.The original 'Men in Black' offered a pleasant change-of-pace for science fiction fans. Essentially, this silly, 'Far Side' satire cleverly combined the police procedural TV show 'Dragnet' with the 'Star Wars' cantina scene. Sonnenfeld has helmed all three 'Men in Black' epics. Along the way, he has made some changes. Not only does Sonnenfeld eliminate Zed, but he also has replaced Zed with a younger woman. For example, Zed (Rip Torn) has died, and Agent K delivers a cryptic but dispassionate eulogy. Agent O (Emma Thompson) replaces Zed. Later, we learn that Agent K and Agent O were romantically involved. Unfortunately, the filmmakers fail to make the standard-issue, alien invasion of Earth plot feel refreshing. Sonnenfeld and Cohen do everything to raise the stakes in this outlandish sequel. Although some changes are obvious and accounted for, others are not so clear-cut, particularly the liberties taken with time travel.The biggest change involves the scope of 'MIB 3.' Although the adversary is an alien, little about Boris prompts laughs. The decision to go into the past makes 'Men in Black 3' different from the previous two films. Sonnenfeld and Cohen allow Boris to take things right down to the wire. 'Men in Black 3' is the tail chasing the dog, but it is so energetic that you can ignore its lapses in logic. Brolin and Smith are charismatic enough even when the plot stumbles from one big set-piece to another. Some critics have skewered the logic of the time travel plot. How can two characters and their counterparts inhabit the same time and setting without negating their alter-egos? For that matter, how is it that Agent J can remain a Man in Black if Agent K weren't around to recruit him? After Sonnenfeld and Cohen resolve the end-of-the-world plot, they cap off 'Men in Black 3' with a hopelessly contrived ending that brings the franchise full circle. The closure that comes with the return of Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K has an eerie sense of finality. Happily, 'Men in Black 3' boasts some novel gadgets, like a motorcycle with one giant wheel that the motorists rides inside and jet-packs that resemble chrome-plated Gemini capsules.Comparatively, 'Men in Black 3' surpasses 'Men in Black 2,' but lacks the spontaneity of 'Men in Black.' Josh Brolin ushers in some refreshing vitality with his inspired performance as Agent K, and the ambitious plot resembles a sci-fi, James Bond escapade rather than a goofy actioneer.",7,1,4,3 June 2012
Scarface," One of the Seminal Crime Films of the 1980s!
","Brian De Palma's contribution to crime movies is a splendid but extended remake of the Howard Hawks classic that toplined Paul Muni. Al Pacino of 'The Godfather' trilogy plays the eponymous Cuban refugee sent to America during the infamous Mariel wave of boat people when Castro emptied his jails. This lengthy but engrossing drama depicts how the protagonist made it to the top of the world. When they made this movie in 1983, the producers probably had no idea about either the controversy that would erupt during the lensing in south Florida or the ultimate cult status that this corrosive tragedy would generate. Eventually, the film stirred up so much ill feeling that Universal had to complete the shooting in California. De Palma and scenarist Oliver Stone took one of the three greatest crime movies of the century and exploited a historical event to make their gangsters reminiscent of the immigrant gangsters during the era of the first 'Scarface' movie. Indeed, at one point, Tony Montana explains that he learned English because his American father took him to see Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney movies. Considering that the film runs just shy of three hours, the filmmakers do a good job of balancing the violent empire building scenes with Tony's domestic life. Composer Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack is surely one of the classics. Lenser John A. Alonzo's widescreen color photography is elegant. Squeamish people should probably avoid this trigger-happy, shoot'em up saga, the chainsaw scene in the bathroom of a motel is pretty gory stuff.Our protagonist Tony (Al Pacino) rises from the streets literally after he performs a murder for Miami drug dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia of 'Prizzi's Honor') and obtains a greed card for his closest pal Manny (Steven Bauer of 'Raising Cain') and himself. They start out a dishwashers for a street vendor, but it doesn't take them long to put on their suits and ties and then they never look back. Later, Lopez henchman Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham of 'Amadeus') offers Tony and Manny $500 to unload a marijuana boat. Tony thinks the deal stinks; he has heard $1000 was that the going price for unloading pot. Omar winds up offering them a bigger paycheck. If they can pick up twp keys of cocaine from a gang of Colombians arriving in Miami, Tony and Manny can earn $5000. Tony and Manny along with a couple of their Cuban buddies pull up to the Sun Ray Motel, and life is never the same afterward Tony enters the room. The Colombian and Tony play cat and mouse to start with, but things change quickly when the Colombians demand to see Tony's money is. They grab Tony's back-up man Angel Fernandez (Pepe Sernaat of 'Honeysuckle Rose') the door and cut him up with the chainsaw before Manny bursts in the room with a machine gun and blasts away at everybody in sight. The evil Colombian chieftain who wielded the chainsaw tries to escape, but Tony chases him down in the middle of the street in front of everybody and puts a bullet in his head. Not only does Tony bring Lopez the coke but also the money. Lopez takes an immediate liking to Tony, and Tony sets his sights on Lopez's slinky but gorgeous squeeze, Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer of 'The Hollywood Knights'), but she seems more intent on snorting cocaine. Lopez assures Tony that if he flies straight with him that he will enjoy a long, happy life. He tells him that the biggest problem that Tony will face is what to do with all the stinking money. Lopez sends Omar and Tony to South America to talk with a major drug-lord Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar of 'The End of August') about cocaine. Sosa smells a rat and has Omar taken up in a helicopter and thrown out with a noose around his throat. According to Sosa, Omar had informed on a couple of drug dealers. Predictably, Lopez is furious when Tony comes back with Omar and has a deal of a lifetime for Lopez that the crime kingpin cannot afford to buy. Tony assures Lopez that he can make up any difference in the lack of money by going out and hitting the streets. When Lopez argues that the Diaz brothers won't take kindly to Tony's ambitious movie, Tony erupts in a rage at Lopez. He is prepared to kill anybody that gets in his way. Lopez puts a contract out on Tony and two killers try to mow him down at the Babylon Club. Tony and his men kill both Lopez and Tony takes Elvira as his wife. He buys an estate, sets up a real estate business, and lives large, installing a 24-hour security monitoring system at his home. Ironically, Tony's affection for children bring him down along with his ferocious coke habit. When the cartel finds itself in the spotlight because of an anti-narcotic activist, Sosa appeals to Tony to help them. Tony is facing a stretch in prison, but Sosa assures him that he will come out clean if he helps his non-English speaking killer murder the activist with a car bomb. Tony betrays Sosa and kills his man when the man tries to blow up the activist's car with the man's wife and two children. Sosa hits back with a gang of gunmen who descend on Tony's estate.The themes of trust, greed, betrayal and cocaine abuse permeate Oliver Stone's screenplay, and he has penned some memorable dialogue. 'Nothing exceeds like excess,' Elvira observes as she snorts some coke. The performances are all excellent, especially Loggia. De Palma and Stone carefully stage a terrific finale when dozens of armed Colombians attack his home and he breaks out a deadly assault rifle with a rocket launcher.",10,3,7,14 June 2010
Walk the Line," A Line Worth Walking
","Everybody dreams about attaining super stardom as a singer. Hollywood has been making movies about career-oriented crooners since Al Jolson captivated audiences with his warbling in the first 'talkie' picture 'The Jazz Singer.' Biographies about musicians either fictional or factual since 'The Jazz Singer' (1927) have been a Tinseltown staple. The late 1940s saw Larry Parks portraying 'Jazz Singer' Jolson in 'The Jolson Story' (1946), but the template for recent bio-musicals grew out of the 1950s. The Susan Hayward epic 'With a Song in My Heart' (1951) about songstress Jane Froman struggling for a comeback after a plane crash and the Frank Sinatra opus 'The Joker Is Wild' (1957) about nightclub performer Joe E. Brown surviving gangsters who slashed his vocal chords represent two examples. The earliest country western vocalist whose ill-fated affairs inspired a movie was Hank Williams, Sr., in 'Your Cheatin' Heart' (1964), starring George Hamilton in one of his few memorable roles. Basically, the thing that sets these biopics apart is whether the songster is still alive at the time of the film's release. Mind you, Williams died more than a decade before 'Your Cheatin' Heart,' but his accidental death gave that film an unforgettable air of tragedy. Sissy Spacek's Oscar-winning portrayal of Loretta Lynn in 'Coal Miner's Daughter' (1980) serves as the most recent model for country western crooners, overshadowing Jessica Lange's evocative but overlooked 'Sweet Dreams' (1985) about the doomed life of Patsy Cline. One theme, however, prevails throughout these bio-musicals; each performer pays a perilous price for fame and fortune. Despite overwhelming odds, they ascend the scales of fame only to plunge into a pit of addiction. The Billie Holiday story 'Lady Sings the Blues' (1971) with Supremes lead singer Diana Ross emerged as one of the earliest efforts where drug addiction figured prominently in the depiction of a star's demise.'Copland' director James Mangold's authentic but anemic biopic 'Walk the Line' about the life and tunes of country music superstar Johnny Cash, illustrates the latest example of the rags-to-riches saga about a singer caught up in drug addiction. 'Gladiator' heavy Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the notorious 'Man in Black' who rose to fame alongside the rockabilly likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly in the late 1950s. Johnny Cash fans should ignore the complaints against 'Walk the Line' leveled by the singer's relatives. Ultimately, however, who would want to endure the trials and tribulations that Cash suffered to carve out his unique niche as a popular American musical icon. More often than not, 'Walk the Line' qualifies relentlessly depressing. Some may complain that their favorite songs, like 'A Boy Named Sue,' got lost in the shuffle. Indeed, Phoenix looks like a dead ringer for Cash, and he mimics Cash's trademark mannerisms, including the way the Arkansas native wielded his guitar on stage like a weapon. Lightweight leading lady Reese Witherspoon of the 'Legally Blonde' movies matches Phoenix note for note as sassy June Carter. 'Walk the Line' amounts to Witherspoon's best performance since her trash-talking villainess in the forgotten 1996 crime melodrama 'Freeway.' Similar to Spacek in 'Coal Miner's Daughter,' Phoenix and Witherspoon performed the songs themselves without professional singers dubbing their voices. Scenarist Gill Dennis of 'Return to Oz' and Mangold based their highly selective screenplay on Johnny Cash's autobiography. Undeniably, they had to take liberties or this gloomy 138-minute, PG-13 parable would have worn out its welcome. They chart Cash's life from his origins as an Arkansas sharecropper's son. Two themes form the emotional crux. First, Cash's saintly older brother Jack (newcomer Lucas Till) died trying to earn a dollar in an awful lumber yard accident. Our hero bore the burden of grief for his brother's death, because he went fishing while Jack cut wood on a table saw. Cash felt that his father blamed him for his Jack's death. Second, an unhappily married Cash pursued elusive vocalist June Carter obsessively from the first time that they met on stage. Like all singer biopics, 'Walk the Line' shows Johnny Cash surmounting wholly impossible obstacles to attain stardom. The landmark album that Cash recorded at Folsom Prison where he serenaded murderers, thieves, and rapists turned his career around and made him a superstar. Mangold deserves credit for never sugar-coating this saga. Nevertheless, after two hours of watching Cash's tortured life, you'd have to be a masochist to want to follow in his footsteps. The least talked about performance in his superbly cast movie, however, is Robert Patrick as Cash's gruff father. Since his villainous debut in 'Terminator 2' (1991), Patrick has been typecast as a tough guy in anonymous straight-to-video actioneers. As undeniably gripping as Phoenix and Witherspoon are, Patrick anchors the action as Cash's long suffering father. Uneven at times and predictably grim as all get out, 'Walk the Line' still ranks as pretty powerful stuff.",8,0,0,18 June 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," What A Waste of Time!
","Comedy as a film genre has changed considerably since 'The Groove Tube' created gross-out humor in 1974. Basically, most risqué film comedies try to synthesize lowbrow scatological shenanigans with crude sexual monkeyshines. 'Kentucky Fried Movie,' 'Animal House,' 'Airplane,' and 'Porky's' followed in the footsteps of 'The Groove Tube' in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Farrelly Brothers established new rules for gross-out humor with 'Dumb and Dumber' (1994) and 'There's Something About Mary' (1998). None of the Farrelly's later films achieved the popularity of either 'Dumber' or 'Mary.' The Weitz Brothers pushed the envelope even further with 'American Pie' (1999) and its sequel 'American Pie 2' (2001). The Wayans Brothers intensified gross-out comedy with their 'Scary Movie' franchise and made millions with the first two entries. The wacky but less perverted Zucker Brothers of 'Airplane' fame took over the series with 'Scary Movie 3' and substituted absurdity for perversion. Popular HBO comedian Sacha Baron Cohen of the 'Da Ali G Show' has made the latest attempt to take film comedy to a new zenith or nadir depending on taste or tastelessness. Although the jokes miss more often than hit the target in 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' (* out of ****), Cohen's comedy of errors is making a lot of people laugh.'Borat' qualifies as a typical fish-out-of-water comedy about a klutzy foreign journalist on his first tour of America. Imagine what might happen if the Beverly Hillbillies went to Iran, and you'll have some kind of a clue about what the filmmakers were trying to do. British comic Sacha Baron Cohen bears a striking resemblance to late rock music icon Frank Zappa, and the brainless Kazakhstan reporter that he impersonates here dresses like the Howard Sprague character that Jack Dobson played in 18 episodes of 'The Andy Griffith Show' on TV between 1966 and 1968. Cohen generates some hilarity with his quasi-Polish accent, even though Kazakhstan's chief language is Russian, and mangles the English language with delightful results. This thin tale unfolds without fanfare in Borat's third-world village in Kazakhstan. Cohen breaks the invisible fourth wall as Borat and speaks directly to the audience when he introduces his family as well as the village rapist. At one point, he kisses a woman, identifies her as his sister, and then boasts about the trophy that she won for being 'the fourth best prostitute in all of country.' Afterward, he piles all himself and his luggage into a taxi that is drawn by a couple of mules and heads off for America. Borat claims to be the sixth best reporter in Kazakhstan. His fat, scummy, pinchpenny producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian of 'Frogtown 2') and he fly to New York to make a documentary about America. Along the way, Borat surprises the passengers with a live chicken that he packs around in a valise. In New York City, Borat tries to buy a Hummer once an auto dealer convinces him that Hummers attract women. Unfortunately, poor Borat doesn't have enough dough and has to settle for a used $700 ice cream wagon that plays kiddy music over an intercom. His producer and he argue about finances after Borat becomes infatuated with 'Baywatch' honey Pamela Anderson. Originally, they had planned to confine their documentary to New York City alone, but Borat's hopeless infatuation with the 'Baywatch' star prompts him to travel across country so that he can propose to her. Borat and his producer temporarily part company after our protagonist catches the latter abusing Borat's Pamela Anderson magazine for prurient purposes. The audience that I sat with went berserk over this scene, especially when Borat and Azamat wrestled nude with their hindquarters in each other's faces, before they ran amok in the buff through a hotel convention, flashing everybody. When Borat isn't making a complete fool of himself, he tries to make fools out of real-life people. Apparently, he managed to fool these nitwits into believing that he was a real-life journalist. The overall effect is worth a smirk or two but not a belly laugh. One instance early in the movie occurs at the ABC-TV affiliate in Jackson, Mississippi, WAPT-TV, where he dupes the Morning News crew in believing his lies. The jokes are mostly tame, and Cohen doesn't resort to the 'Punk'd' MTV antics of Ashton Kutcher. White Southerners make easy targets for Borat. He dines with a middle-class group of Southerners who appeared to have been plucked from the early 1960s and shocks when his fat African-American girl/prostitute date shows up. In another scene, the oblivious reporter visits a White Supremacist's antique shop and accidentally destroys over $400 worth of merchandise. No, this scene isn't a tenth as funny as a similar scene in 'Jackass: The Movie' (2002) set at a car rental agency. Eventually, Borat hitches a ride to California with a bunch of drunken frat boys, meets Pamela Anderson at an autograph session, and attempts to kidnap her. 'Seinfeld' TV producer Larry Charles makes his debut as director with 'Borat.' Cohen and he season their trim 82-minute farce with some politically subversive wit. They ridicule Jews unmercifully and Cohenwho is Jewish himselftakes particular delight in this clowning around. In one scene at an American gun shop, Borat makes inquiries about the best gun with which to shoot Jews. Watching 'Borat' is like binge drinking. Binge-drinkers go until they blow. Despite its classic comic set-up, 'Borat' blows more often than goes.",1,2,4,3 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Better than the First 'Sherlock Holmes'
","According to The Guinness World Records, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's illustrious literary detective Sherlock Holmes ranks as 'the most portrayed movie character' in cinematic history. Indeed, Hollywood has been shooting movies about Sherlock Holmes since the initial one-reeler, 'Sherlock Holmes Baffled,' appeared in 1900, as a 30-second silent epic. Since then a number of actors have taken up residence at 221 B Baker Street, ranging from the most vintage, Basil Rathbone during the 1940s, to the most bohemian, Robert Downey, Jr., who received a Golden Globe for his performance in director Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' (2009). 'Lethal Weapon' producer Joel Silver and Ritchie have brought back Holmes for a superior sequel, 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,' and 'Paper Man' scenarists Michele and Kieran Mulroney have pitted him against his most diabolical nemesis, that Napoleon of Crime, Professor James Moriarty. Nothing less than the fate of Western civilization hangs in the balance during this taut 129 minute melodrama which sends Dr. Watson with our eponymous protagonist globetrotting across Europe after 'Sherlock Holmes' had confined them to London. Although Lord Blackwood proved an audacious adversary in 'Sherlock Holmes,' Moriarty emerges as a far more stimulating opponent in a sequel that surpasses its predecessor. This Moriarty may be the best in any Holmes adventure. Ritchie and the Mulroneys have put the Victorian Era sleuth through the paces with several exciting sequences, including a bullet-riddled shoot-out on a railway train to a challenging chess match in a scenic castle in Switzerland posed on a waterfall. Happily, 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' preserves the formula of its predecessor in every detail and character, not only replaying the ingenious Holmes-O-Vision fisticuffs scenes but also ushering in new characters, such as Holmes' brilliant elder brother Mycroft. My only complaint about this otherwise tour-de-force mystery thriller is the short shrift given to Holmes' love interest, Irene Adler, who doesn't garner her share of screen time.'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' takes place in the year 1891 as anarchy threatens to engulf Europe and ignite war between France and Germany. The press speculates either nationalists or anarchists are behind the violence, but Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr. of 'Iron Man') believes Moriarty is to blame. Indeed, Moriarty is to blame! No sooner do his unwitting henchmen carry out a piece of his elaborate puzzle of murder and mayhem than a dishonorably discharged British sniper, Colonel Sebastian Moran (Paul Anderson of 'A Lonely Place to Die'), kills them with extreme prejudice. Essentially, the sequel picks up where its predecessor more or less off as Dr. Watson is poised to wed Mary (Kelly Reilly of 'Pride & Prejudice') despite Holmes' indefatigable efforts to derail matrimony. Holmes and Watson visit a London night club where Holmes was supposed to throw Watson's stag party. Instead, Holmes runs into his brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry of 'St. Trinian's') and leaves a disgruntled Watson to gamble while he meets a gypsy woman, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace of the Swedish film 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'), who has been searching for her long lost brother named Rene. No sooner does Holmes read her fortune than a smelly Cossack warrior attacks them in an exhilarating scene. Later, after they escape, Holmes meets Moriarty at the university where he teaches mathematics. This is Holmes' first encounter with Moriarty, and Moriarty tells him he plans to kill both Watson and his wife Mary on their honeymoon. Naturally, Holmes sets out to thwart him and all hell breaks loose.Oscar-nominated actor Robert Downey, Jr., has another field day playing Sherlock Holmes. Some of his disguises make him virtually invisible. What may irritate die-hard Baker Street regulars are Downey's undignified antics, particularly when he appears in drag to thwart the villains on the railroad out to murder Watson and his wife. Downey's funniest scene has Holmes straddling a Shetland pony to the hilarious strains of Ennio Morricone's music from the Clint Eastwood & Shirley MacLaine oater 'Two Mules for Sister Sara.' Undoubtedly, Downey's best dramatic scene occurs when he crosses analytical swords with Jared Harris' Machiavellian Professor Moriarty. Mind you, Downey displays more personality than Harris. Nevertheless, Harris makes an undeniably menacing impression with a grand scheme to start a war. Jude Law reprises his role as Dr. Watson, and the chemistry between Law and Downey is still as charismatic as ever. Watson isn't the bumbling oaf that Nigel Bruce was in the memorable Basil Rathbone outings in the 1940s. The mustached Law is as sharp with his wardrobe as he is with his revolver. For that matter, he is pretty good with military artillery. As Watson's future wife, Kelly Reilly acquires more screen time here. Other supporting characters from the original, such as Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) and Holmes' landlady Mrs. Hudson (Geraldine James), are back. One of producer Joel Silver's better characteristics is his predilection for retaining the same characters as well as actors as he did in his quartet of 'Lethal Weapon' blockbusters. As usual, despite his revisionist handling of Holmes as a pugnacious action hero, Ritchie makes sure that this lavishly produced thriller never wears out its welcome. Holmes and Watson find themselves up to their respective necks in danger. Meantime, the filmmakers never fall back on the formulaic woman-in-peril plot with regard to Madam Simza and her part in the action. Unlike the first Ritchie 'Holmes,' the sequel boasts a couple of tragic moments, but these don't slow down the pace. Thanks to a lot of gorgeous computer-generated imagery and 'Sommersby' lenser Philippe Rousselot's photography, everything looks convincingly Victorian. Nothing about 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' is merely elementary, but everything is wholly entertaining.",10,0,4,19 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," More Entertaining Than 'Hulk'
","'Transporter' director Louis Leterrier's 'The Incredible Hulk' delivers the melodramatic thrills and chills conspicuously lacking in Ang Lee's self-conscious, brooding, tragic predecessor. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana. Ironically, Norton turned the role before Bana took it. Mind you, Norton is an exceptional actor, but he is basically miscast. Simply said, he doesn't look appropriate for the role of an action hero. Meantime, Mark Ruffalo qualifies as the cinema's best Hulk. Meantime, Bana was a better fit, but Norton is not without sympathy. Norton's Banner is a fugitive on the lam. If you have forgotten Ang Lee's 'Hulk,' Leterrier and Pen use the opening titles to retell the origins of the Hulk in the laboratory. Hardcore Hulk fans may not like this departure from the Marvel canon. The original 'Hulk' movie followed the same strategy of orchestrating the transformation in a lab.As the action unfolds, Leterrier and 'Elektra' scenarist Zac Penn have our intelligent hero hiding out in Brazil and slumming as an employee at a dilapidated soda bottle plant. Bruce is their jack-of-all-trades handy man, and his ability to fix things is what gets him into trouble. After repairing a mechanism, he nicks a finger, and droplets of his blood stain the conveyor belt and contaminate one bottle. Clearly, quality control is not a strong point at this factory. When our hero isn't working in the factory, he communicates via the Internet with Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson of 'The Astronaut Farmer'), and they struggle to discover a cure. Of course, nothing works for Bruce. At the same time, Bruce is taking lessons from a martial arts mentor about how to control his rage. He wears a watch that monitors his pulse and develops deep-breathing from the diaphragm to curb his rage. Eventually, after that tainted bottle of Pingo Doce reaches America, an ordinary guy ('Hulk' co-creator Stan Lee) in Milwaukee experiences a reaction to it, and General 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt of 'Altered States') assembles a team led by an elite commando, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of 'Reservoir Dogs'), who is locked and loaded for combat. Blonsky and his team fly into Brazil and narrowly miss capturing Banner. Banner's mongrel dog awakens him in time for him to make his escape. Ross congratulates Blonsky for a good job, but Blonsky wants to take another crack at the monstrous green thing he encountered in the factory. 'It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball,' he tells Ross. Banner makes his way up through Central America and reunites with Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler of 'Armageddon'), and Ross is on his trail again. This time Blonsky and his team are prepared better when they tangle with the Hulk on the Culver University campus. Betty tries to convince Bruce to turn himself over to her father. Bruce points out that Ross wants what is in him and will sacrifice him to extract his DNA to forge an army of super soldiers. Bruce reminds Betty that he wants to find a cure. Again, Ross wants to create super soldiers with Bruce's super strength and agility.For the record, Banner transforms into the Hulk at about 23 minutes into 'The Incredible Hulk.' Leterrier stages some reasonably good action scenes. Ultimately, the Penn screenplay boils down to a chase thriller that concludes face to face showdown like an old fashioned western between Banner and Blonsky. Tim Roth makes a terrific adversary, but the final confrontation suffers because you know it is just a clash of CGI titans. Liv Tyler and William Hurt are serviceable as Banner's girlfriend and another of his adversaries. You can get your quotient of blood, gore, and violence out of this PG-13 epic.",8,0,0,11 May 2015
The Monuments Men," Fatigue Duty
","I love World War II movies, even stinkers like Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds.' For the record, I prefer Enzo G. Castellari's made-in-Italy, World War II mission movie 'The Inglorious Bastards' (1978) that Tarantino took and altered drastically with his remake. Nevertheless, I haven't seen a good World War II epic since Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) with Tony Hanks. Everything after 'Saving Private Ryan' pales in comparison to classics such as 'A Bridge Too Far ,' 'Battle of the Bulge,' 'Beach Red,' 'Castle Keep,' 'Catch 22,' 'Sands of Iwo Jima,' 'The Bridge at Remagen,' 'The Devil's Brigade,' 'The Dirty Dozen,' 'The Great Escape,' 'The Guns of Navarone,' 'The Longest Day,' and 'The Train.' These seminal films appear with regularity during patriotic holidays on both AMC and Turner Classics. Initially, I thought writer & director George Clooney's 'The Monuments Men' might tower above all the second-rate shrapnel that Hollywood has been shelling out like 'Normandy,' 'Company of Heroes,' 'Battle Force,' 'Fortress,' 'Red Tails,' 'Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed,' and 'Pathfinders.' Unfortunately, this fascinating chapter in World War II history about Allied soldiers who toiled to save the treasured paintings and sculptures of Western Civilization that Adolf Hitler looted during his 12-year reign as Der Führer amounts to a monumental bore. Meantime, Clooney has assembled a superlative cast including 'Private Ryan' himself Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. The production values look first-rate. Clooney's production designers and art directors shot the works with their $70-million budget to create sprawling scenes of bombed out towns and authentic aircraft laden military landing fields. Furthermore, to accentuate the realism, Clooney lensed these maneuvers on location in England and Germany, too.'The Monuments Men' covers a little known chapter in American military history that occurred after the Allies broke through Hitler's defenses on the French coast in 1944. Clooney and co-scripter Grant Heslov, who co-produced and appears briefly as a doctor in a scene, adapted the history tome 'The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History' by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter. This World War II movie focuses on an outfit of old-ball scholars, architects, and museum curators who sought to recover the art works that Hitler pilfered and planned to place in a Nazi museum in his home town in Austria. An earlier text 'The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War' by Lynn H. Nichols documented this event. Indeed, back in 2008, Public Broadcasting produced a documentary based on the Nichols book. The documentary is more exciting than anything that Clooney recreates in this static spectacle. Burt Lancaster played a brave French railroad official in 'The Train' (1964) who thwarted the Nazis from stealing art.'The Monuments Men' resembles a 1960s era World War II blockbuster with its abundance of vintage uniforms and equipment. World War II fans will appreciate the authentic Sherman tank that rumbles through two scenes. No, you won't find any M-48 Patton tanks masquerading as either Sherman or Tiger tanks. Unfortunately, little violence occurs in this loquacious, leisurely 119 minute opus. Two of our heroes die from enemy bullets with a minimum of bloodshed. Two of them capture a Nazi youth sniper during a brief exchange of rifle fire. 'The Bridge at Remagen' contained a similar scene. A firefight breaks out in a peaceful pasture between Nazis and American G.I.s after one of our heroes spots a stallion and stops to admire it. A Nazi officer fires his pistol at an off-screen Allied officer and mortally wounds him. Neither are shown in the same shot dramatically slinging lead at each other. George Clooney attacks a brick wall in a tunnel with a pick-ax. Possibly the most egregious act that occurs is several actors smoke cigarettes. The smoking is virtually pervasive. Remember, Uncle Sam stashed cigarettes in K-rations. Sometimes, a rare profane word is uttered. Otherwise, 'The Monuments Men' amounts to a lukewarm World War II movie that loiters on the periphery of the action. At one point, two of our heroes are at the Battle of the Bulge but not in the battle itself. Clooney never cuts loose with a machine gun at the Nazis. Indeed, our starry cast spends more time talking about what they are going to do than riddling the enemy with lead. Occasionally, Clooney shows the evil Nazis gloating over stolen art work. Our heroes do undergo basic training. At one point, John Goodman stops crawling through an obstacle course and stands up while a G.I. is firing a machine gun. Later, Goodman is appalled when he learns the soldier was blasting away with bullets instead of blanks! 'The Monuments Men' shuns conspicuous blood and gore as much as it does dramatic conflict.'The Monuments Men' suffers from several shortcomings. First, characterization is one-dimensional. We are given little insight into any of these characters. Each has a nominal scene that introduces them, but Clooney is more interested in what they are doing than who they are. Cate Blanchett has the most provocative role. She served as a secretary to the Nazis and maintained an inventory of their systemic looting of treasures from Paris. Initially, she is imprisoned for collaborating with the Nazis, when she hated them. After the authorities spring her, she approaches our guys with suspicions until Matt Damon flashes his reassuring smile. Second, the storytelling is episodic. Various men go off on various adventures. Third, the adventures lack pugnacity. Nothing memorable either happens or is uttered. Fourth, Clooney abhors dramatizing anything. A land mind scene in a cave could have yielded a little sweat and anxiety, but Clooney plays it strictly for low-key laughs. Fifth, the orchestral theme music fails to bolster the action and often sounds like it is undercutting it. Watching 'The Monuments Men' is the equivalent of fatigue duty.",Null,5,11,8 February 2014
Antz," Even Adults Will Be Animated by 'Antz!'
","'Antz' is the first computer animated feature from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Studio. Apparently, Spielberg and his studio partner Jeffrey Katzenberg wanted to beat their competitionWalt Disney and its 'Bug'by releasing 'Antz' five months ahead of its original release date. Despite its predictable, anthropomorphic, B-movie plot, populated with obvious stereotypes, and indebted to several sci-fi films, 'Antz' manages to enchant. Pacific Data Images' impressive 3-D animation; the witty, grown-up dialogue; the messages about conformity vs. individualism; and on-target voicing by a constellation of stars all make 'Antz' an exhilarating experience. Not only does 'Antz' emerge as an ingenious cartoon, but adults also can enjoy it without feeling insulted by its puny heroics. While the stimulating CGI special effects will flabbergast kiddies, the film's adult-oriented themes may boggle their wee minds. Happily, too, 'Antz' dispenses with any Top-40 wannabe hits sung by the cast.Indeed, the Todd Alcott and Chris & Paul Weitz screenplay covers familiar Disney ground. Work ant Z-4195 (Woody Allen, the cinematic master of the meshuganah comedy) complains about the conformist society where he toils long hours alongside millions of other proletarian ants in the excavation of a mega tunnel. Signs emblazoned with slogans such as 'Free time is for training,' 'Let's Work,' and 'We, Not You' proliferate in a setting that resembles Fritz Lang's 1926 silent, sci-fi, German, masterpiece 'Metropolis.' Like typical Woody Allen heroes, such as Broadway Danny Rose and Alvy Singer, Z qualifies as an angst-addled neurotic who babbles with a nasal twang and spouts consistently cute one-liners. Perennial feelings of insignificance bug Z. He sums up his plight as a 'soil relocation engineer' to his ant therapist (Paul Mazurky's voice) in the film's first scene.'I always feel uncomfortable around crowds. I have this fear of enclosed spaces. When you're the middle child in a family of five million, you don't get any attention. My father was basically a drone. I feel physically inadequate. My whole life, I've never been able to lift more than ten times my body weight,' Z explains. Incredibly, Woody Allen didn't write 'Antz.' Co-directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson let him tailor the dialogue to fit his native vocal patterns. Insiders say the cast recorded their voices during individually taped sessions, and that the animators incorporated signature physical gestures into their animation. Nope, Z doesn't resemble Allen. In fact, Z favors a classic Spielberg character who loved to hitch a ride in the basket of a bicycle during a full moon.Anyway, Z is a lowly worker ant with nothing except his paranoia to distinguish him. Z's friendly, female co-worker, Azteca (Jennifer Lopez of 'Enough'), tries to discourage Z from thinking such nonconformist nonsense. Z, however, refuses to accept his place as just another meaningless cog in a big machine. 'I'm supposed to do everything for the colony?' Z gripes. 'And what about my needs?' In the middle of the plot, the writers introduce the concept of an insect nirvana called Insectopia. In Insectopia, you can get anything that you want and you don't have to work for it! While Weaver and an ant are in the bar, they hear about an ant that has been to the fabled Insectopia. The truth that Z discovers about Insectopia adds to the mirth of 'Antz.' This entire conversation sounds like something that was edited out of the Humphrey Bogart classic 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre.' Meanwhile, the subversive General Mandible (dubbed by a villainous Gene Hackman) has convinced the gullible queen ant (Anne Bancroft) that their sworn enemies, acid-spewing termites, pose a threat. Not only does the colony's future depend on the new mega tunnel, but the ants also can only ensure their survival with a preemptive strike against the termites. Can we say 'Starship Troopers?' Actually, Mandible wants to wipe out his colony so that he can wed the queen ants' lovely daughter, Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), and the build his own ant empire.At least, 'Antz' has a villain that thinks big! Those termites are pretty scary, too. They resemble a souped-up version of the boss critter of the spiders in 'Starship Troopers' The ugly fiends have hoses sticking out of their foreheads that spray acid. The clever staging of the assault on a decaying tree stump, the Termite HQ, and how Z manages to survive the suicidual battle is well-done. Adult critics that try to shield young children from reality may have a hard time dealing with the Danny Glover character whose decapitated head talks. Z finds Barbatus (Danny Glover of 'Lethal Weapon') on a battlefield littered with hundreds of dead ants and termites. 'Don't follow orders all your life,' screams the disembodied head to Z before it dies.Anyhow, Bala balks at wedlock to the megalomaniacal Mandible. Slumming incognito in a nightspot, she spots Z standing alone at the bar and picks him up. They upset an army of ants sash-shaying on the dance floor to the strains of 'Guantanamera.' Bala and Z improvise their own jitterbug a la 'Pulp Fiction.' Chaos erupts into an old-fashioned bar room brawl out of a John Wayne western. Bala flees, but Z resolves to see her again. Switching places with muscle-headed, nice guy soldier ant pal, Weaver (splendidly voiced by Sylvester Stallone), Z gets to parade past the princess. When he learns that Weaver's company is shipping out on a suicide mission to destroy the Termites, Z's plans go awry. Meanwhile, Weaver has the time of his life in the tunnel romancing Azteca. Miraculously, Z survives Mandible's massacre. Surprising the evil general, Z returns to a warrior's welcome. Things go suddenly wrong for Z, and he tries to escape from Mandible. Inadvertently, Z kidnaps Bala, and they flee for Insectopia. Insectopia turns out to be a picnic area in Central Park, New York City. Eventually, Z exposes Mandible, wins the princess' hand in marriage after nearly getting squashed by a giant, bubble-gum encrusted sneaker!'Antz' is a funny, fast-moving hill of hilarity.",8,4,7,14 June 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," An Engrossing Revenge Epic
","Bruce Willis plays a world-class assassin with a soft spot in 'Gangster No 1' helmer Paul McGuigan's 'Lucky Number Slevin,' and he wears a hairpiece, too! This complicated, flashback-riddled, surprise-laden, revenge thriller co-stars Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, Robert Forster and Stanley Tucci. McGuigan and 'My Own Worst Enemy' scenarist Jason Smilovic keep you guessing throughout their elaborately plotted film's 110 minutes. The humor as well as the quirky dialogue stand out. One gangster lectures our hero about horses: 'My father used to say: 'The first time someone calls you a horse you punch him on the nose, the second time someone calls you a horse you call him a jerk but the third time someone calls you a horse, well then perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle.' McGuigan stages everything with a fresh eye for detail. For example, consider the way that the baseball that strikes bookie Bennie Begin in the eye and kills him is handled. Sometimes, it is just the crazy wallpaper that McGuigan uses that catches your eye. Essentially, the filmmakers orchestrate the action around their own clever gambler's maneuver known as the Kansas City Shuffle. According to murderous hit-man Goodkat, 'Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody looks right and you go left.' You can never take anything literally in 'Lucky Number Slevin.' The hero is not who he really appears to be, and we're the only ones that know it. Nevertheles, even we don't know everything, and McGuigan created considerable tension and suspense by withholding this information. In some ways, ''Lucky Number Slevin' is comparable to the 'Usual Suspects.' Like Tarantino, McGuigan enjoys making references to popular movies, and Hartnett and Lucy Liu converse about the James Bond characters. Later, one of the mobsters makes small talk with our hero and refers to Hitchcock's 'North By Northwest.' 'Lucky Number Slevin' unfolds with an intriguing tragedy involving a racetrack wager on an ill-fated horse back in 1979. It seems the horse was shot up with drugs and was supposed to win a race but died instead before it reached the finish line. One young fellow's entire family pays for his egregious error, and they suffer death by shooting. The man who sought to exploit the secret of the drugged steed has to wait years before he is eliminated, too. Nick Fisher is sitting in a depot when he meets Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) sitting incongruously in a wheel chair. Later, we are introduced to the actual protagonist (Josh Hartnett), who finds himself in an interesting predicament in another man's apartment. Our hero spends the first half of the action on the wrong side of the eight-ball before he surprises us with his actual identity. Every character possesses something interesting about them. You'll meet a Hassidic Jewish gunsel who never says anything and it makes him singular. The ending appears to come out of left field. On the commentary track, McGuigan said that he likes to keep the audience confused. Josh Hartnett spends about a quarter of the film wearing nothing but a towel. Lucy Lui is cast as a sexy coroner.Ostensibly, a young man's life (Josh Hartnett) is turned upside down after he loses his job, his apartment, and catches him girl cheating on him. This is a really amusing scene. His girlfriend is having sex with another guy. She is on her hands and knees and the guy is doing her doggie style when Hartnett walks in on them. Despite being caught in this humiliating position, she carries on a conversation with him. He cannot leave town so he visits a friend's apartment and encounters a pretty lady, Lindsay (Lucy Liu), who showed up looking for sugar. Eventually, because he inhabits the apartment of Nick Fisher, two rival gangsters make some outrageous demands on him. The Boss (Morgan Freeman) wants $96 thousand, while his competitor the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) wants $33 thousand. These two men were once friends but now they are enemies. They live across from each other in Gotham high rises and can see what each other is doing when they stand at their windows. In a sense, this enmity resembles the competition between the opposing sides in the town of San Miquel in Sergio Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars.' About a half hour before its finale, McGuigan's film begins to yield its secrets.Enigmatic but exciting, 'Lucky Number Slevin' will keep you involved from fade in to fade out with all its twists and turns. The violence earned 'Lucky Number Slevin' an R-rating. For the record, Hartnett gets punched twice in the nose, and later Stanley Tucci wallops him in the stomach. Several characters die in a brutal manner. Indeed, the first character that we see is shown as he is about to enter his car. We are looking at the scene from inside the vehicle when we see the man approach his car and then the driver's door window shatters with blood and he smashes throughout it. The second man dies when a baseball is hurled at him. This occurs moments before the second man's bodyguards are injected with poison before they realize they have been stricken. Two criminals suffocate in a barbaric death with plastic bags over their heads that are taped snugly around their necks. For the record, McGuigan abhorred the title 'Lucky Number Slevin' and said Kansas City Shuffle would have made a better title.",9,3,5,29 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Lot of Fun
","'THX 1138' director George Lucas' 'Stars Wars' prequel 'Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace' accomplishes four crucial objectives in the franchise. First, it presents the origins of Luke's father Anakin Skywalker, who will eventually deviate to the dark side as Darth Vader. Second, it introduces Queen Amidala who will be Anakin's bride in later episodes, and give birth to Luke. Third, it shows us Obi-Wan Kenobi during his youth as a Jedi. Finally, it let us meet Palpatine later mutates into the dreaded Emperor. Everybody loves to trash this exotic looking piece of space opera, but it provides solid entertainment even if it takes most of its cues from Lucas' original. Liam Neeson gives the film its sense of gravitas, and he serves the same purpose for Ewan McGregor's young Obi-Wan that the elder Obi-Wan gave Luke Skywalker in 'Star Wars.' Of course, everybody complained about comic relief character Jar Jar Binks. He isn't as obnoxious if you watch the film enough. Eventually, the Fanboys may rehabilitate the prequel trilogy. Mind you, as with all prequels, you know in advance who is going to make the cut, so suspense is compromised from the outset. The special effects are trippy as usual, and John Williams' orchestral score is fantastic. Like 'Star Wars,' 'The Phantom Menace' conjures up all manner of creatures. Eventually, the inhabitants of one planet must set aside their differences and join together to whip the outsiders. Apart from stalwarts like Neeson and McGregor, Natalie Portman makes a strong impression as a take-charge kind of gal. 'Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace' is entertaining enough to keep you distracted throughout its running time.",8,7,10,21 December 2015
Sucker Punch," Larger-Than-Life Fantasy Extavaganza!
","'Watchmen' director Zack Snyder's bizarre, babes-in-bondage, fantasy epic imitates Terry Gilliam's far darker, Orwellian, science-fiction satire 'Brazil.' Like 'Brazil' (1985), 'Sucker Punch' taps into the imagination--where anything goes--of an individual--a single, white, female here--before a doctor lobotomizes her at a corrupt mental institution. This ensemble, female-empowerment, chick flick arms Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung to the teeth with samurai swords, sub-machine guns, automatic pistols, and attitude galore as they slash, shoot, and kick their way through a hellzapoppin' variety of 'Heavy Metal' escapades with wizen Scott Glenn briefing them about each mission. Of course, their fetish costumes are as immaculate as the situations that they encounter. This PG-13 rated movie rarely grovels in blood, guts, and gore, and the crisply staged violence is nowhere as savage as 'Saving Private Ryan.' The adventures that Baby Doll and her accomplices embark on before her lobotomy will make you feel like you've been plunged into a swirling vortex of popular culture imagery. This imagery ranges from doll-faced manga-influenced comics to high-stepping musicals like 'Moulin Rouge,' to strange sword & sorcery sagas with vengeful mother dragons, to actual events like World War I trench warfare with Zeppelins air ships that burst into high-octane orange explosions. The soldiers in the World War I sequence are thoroughly ominous-looking, steam-powered German zombie-cyborgs. Every time that either a bullet strikes them or a sword blade gashes them, steam erupts in pneumatic jets from their uniformed bodies.'Sucker Punch' occurs in the 1960s. The prologue that establishes our heroine's predicament blends the creepy look of E.C. Comics with gritty Hollywood B-movies about woman behind bars. Baby Doll (Emily Browning of 'Ghost Ship') and her younger sister react with shock to the death of their mother. Later, Baby Doll's wicked stepfather (Gerard Plunkett of '2012') flies into a rage when he reads his wife' will. He gets nothing, while the two daughters get everything. The furious stepfather decides to rape the younger daughter. First, he locks Baby Doll in her bedroom. Second, he kicks down the door to the younger girl's room. After she breaks out of her room, Baby Doll grabs a gun from downstairs to blast him. Accidentally, she misses the stepfather and tragically shooting her young sister. In no time at all, the stepfather has Baby Doll committed to the spooky Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Vermont. Snyder films this entire opening gambit as if it were an extended MTV rock video. An asylum orderly, the slimy Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac of 'The Nativity Story'), demands that the stepfather pay him $2,000 to forge the signature of asylum psychiatrist Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino of 'Sin City') on the form to authorize Baby Doll's lobotomy. Mind you, the stepfather neither wants for the authorities to discover what really happened at home nor does he want Baby Doll to receive her mom's fortune. Initially, Baby Doll learns that she has five days before the lobotomy is scheduled.The first jarring thing about 'Sucker Punch' is the abrupt change of settings. Once you have resigned yourself to watching a movie that takes place in a mental asylum like the one in 'Shutter Island,' you find the setting shifted to a classy bordello where the girls perform exotic dances for the well-heeled customers. Each time that Baby Doll dances, she mesmerizes her audiences. She imagines that each dance is like completing a larger-than-life mission. During the first mission, she meets a sword master (Scott Glenn) who furnishes her with an arsenal of weapons to battle three gigantic samurai warriors who have piercing red eyes. Baby Doll behaves like an invulnerable heroine. She survives blows from these humongous samurai warriors that would kill ordinary people. Later, she makes friends with the first inmate/dancer when she saves Rocket from being raped by a porcine cook. Eventually, Baby Doll assembles a 'Fox Force Five' unit of dames -- Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish of 'Limitless'), Rocket (Jena Malone of 'The Soloist' ), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens of 'High School Musical') and Amber (Jamie Chung of 'Sorority Row') -- to cavort in the strip-club fantasy costumes with a combination of S.W.A.T gear and samurai swords to obtain four crucial things. Sweet Pea is the hardest of them to convince because she is the most hopeless member of the quintet. Once they come together, they act like a team until the villains whittle down their numbers.Three far-fetched, outlandish sequences with our glamorous ensemble carrying out a mission occur in the episodic 'Sucker Punch.' Mind you, each mission yields rewards that will enable our heroines to escape from the dreadful insane asylum. According to Baby Doll, they need an asylum map to get past the guards. Furthermore, they need fire--in the form of a butane lighter, a knife, and a special key. Obviously, the special key is a master key that will open any asylum lock. Naturally, none of the imaginative, over-the-top missions that transpire on screen apart from those opening and closing moments aren't remotely realistic. Compared with '300,' 'Dawn of the Dead,' and 'Watchmen,' 'Sucker Punch' delivers lightweight blows, but deploys them out with greater sophistication. The characters are as stereotypical as the set-pieces are formulaic. Of course, our heroines are constantly out numbered. Ironically, our heroine surmounts her bigger-than-life obstacles, achieves her incredible goal, but she pays a dear price for it in the long run.Director Zack Snyder immerses our ear drums with atmospheric chart-topping tunes for more than the sake of their rock'n roll cult status. This music propels Baby Doll into her different states of mind. Moreover, Snyder observed that the music thematically holds the film together. Listening to 'Sucker Punch' is like grooving to golden oldies such as 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),' 'White Rabbit,' and two Queen songs 'I Want It All,' and 'We Will Rock You.' Despite its one-dimensional characters and sensory-overload visuals, 'Sucker Punch' qualifies as a suspenseful, above-average, metaphorical, but downbeat fantasy !",7,3,8,3 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," What A Baby!
","Superior sequels develop the plot of their predecessors rather than simply imitate them. 'Gods and Monsters' director Bill Condon and 'Twilight' scenarist Melissa Rosenberg have taken producer Stephenie Meyer's fourth novel 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn' and raised the stakes as well as the rivalry. The rivalry here is not confined to just Edward and Jacob, but rather Jacob and his tribe. Mind you, if you've read the novels, you're in better shape to understand the storyline. Anybody walking into 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part One,' however, may find themselves overwhelmed by a surplus of plot which is only comprehensible if they've seen the previous three outings. This holds true particularly for people who find vampire movies irresistible. Ostensibly, Meyers has rewritten the rules that govern conventional vampire conduct to the point that the 'Twilight' movies emerge as vampire epics in name only. In 'Breaking Dawn, Part One,' vampires swim in streams as well as oceans. They can procreate like humans and sire offspring. They can cavort about in the daylight without any deleterious effects to their dermatology. They can admire their immortal beauty in a mirror. They even keep a cross in their house! Although their mortal enemies the werewolves can shape-shift from Native Americans to wolves, Meyer's vampires cannot convert themselves into either bats or wolves like Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula and his kind. Meyer's vampires can read minds, foresee the future, and race hither and yon in a flash, but they remain pretty much grounded. At one point in 'Breaking Dawn,' the vampires must run a gauntlet of werewolves so that they can feed, and the fleet-footed wolves make it nip and tuck the whole way. You'd think Edward and the Cullen clan would scale the trees and hurdle from one to the next, but then the werewolves wouldn't pose much of a problem? All nitpicking aside, 'Breaking Dawn' is just as entertaining as 'Twilight,' 'New Moon,' and 'Eclipse.' Indeed, the characters continue to grow. Personally, I still prefer 'Eclipse,' because the villainous Victoria finally bit the dust. Mind you, 'Breaking Dawn' is still splendid stuff with surprises galore for anybody who has enjoyed the franchise.'Breaking Dawn, Part One' is just what 'Twilight' fans have been dying for from the start. Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson of 'Water for Elephants') and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart of 'Adventureland') finally tie the knot. They exchange vows in the woods surrounded by their friends and family. Unlike some franchises which whittle down the number of characters reprising their roles, the 'Twilight' sagas keep bringing the principals as well as the peripherals back. Unfortunately, the lesser Cullens, who had scenes in 'Eclipse,' merge with the background. The same is true for Bella's high school peers who are around for a glimpse or two. Happily, the character of Jane who is a member of the Volturi, played by the obnoxious Dakota Fanning, is AWOL in this entry. Sadly, she will be back in the finale. The action unfolds with an angry and obviously jealous Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner of 'Abduction') charging off into the wilderness to change into a werewolf when he receives his wedding invitation. Remember, the werewolves here look like overgrown wolves, not the genuinely nasty critters in the 'Underworld' franchise. Meanwhile, Bella struggles to maintain her equilibrium in high heels as Alice (Ashley Greene of 'Skateland') chides her about getting enough beauty sleep. No sooner have they wed than our couple caper off to Brazil and then take a boat ride to a gorgeous private island paradise to be all to themselves. Talk about wish fulfillment! Edward's fangs are so pointy by this time that he literally tears the bed apart on their wedding night. Afterward, they play a lot of chess until Bella gets the hang of it and defeats him. Sure, Edward isn't proud of himself. Bella bears the bruises of his love tussling, but she isn't complaining. While Edward is away on the mainland assuaging his appetite for animal blood, our heroine finds it difficult to keep down her chicken. Oh, no, not morning sickness! This improbable turn of events surprises even Edward. Bella gets sick and Edward flies back Bella back to Forks so Dr. Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli of 'Can't Hardly Wait') can come up with a solution. As it turns out, Carlisle has no solution, and the fetus grows at such an alarming pace that it drains the life out of Bella.Clocking in at 117 minutes, 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part One' spends the first hour getting the action underway with the wedding and then the comic honeymoon antics before director Bill Condon and scribe Melissa Rosenberg take things to the dark side. The special effects that shrink poor Bella until she resembles a Nazi death camp inmate are groundbreaking. Nothing about the way that she deteriorates looks spurious. Since the 'Twilight' saga is rated PG-13, the honeymoon and the battle with the werewolves isn't as horrific as it might have been as an R-rated opus. The werewolves look a little more believable, and they even get to drool saliva. Keep in mind, the 'Twilight' franchise is a romantic fantasy so gravity rarely interferes with these shenanigans. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart still qualify as a sympathetic Romeo and Juliet couple, but the real surprise of 'Breaking Dawn' is Taylor Lautner who brings more gravitas to his role than in previous 'Twilights' or the abysmal 'Abduction' that he starred in earlier this year. Of course, Jacob came to Bella's aid in 'Eclipse' when he wasn't competing with Edward for her affection. Jacob's character assumes greater significance in 'Breaking Dawn.' The fourth entry in the 'Twilight' franchise packs a wallop, particularly near the end. True 'Twilight' fans shouldn't bolt when the end credits roll because more comes after the end credits with the evil Volturi savoring the final moments.",10,1,14,4 December 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," A Road Best Not Taken
","Imagine being trapped inside an underground bunker by John Goodman who claims the air outside will kill you. Our damsel-in-distress encounters this appalling predicament in first-time director Dan Trachtenberg's '10 Cloverfield Lane' after she awakens from a violent car crash. Worse, she finds herself hooked up to an I.V. drip, her injured right knee chained to a cinder block wall, and 'no service' on her cell phone. Reportedly, producer J.J. Abrams has called Trachtenberg's mild R-rated chiller 'the spiritual successor to 'Cloverfield.' Does anybody remember that mediocre monster thriller? The 2008 sci-fi saga 'Cloverfield,' produced for $25 million, made over $170 million at the box office. This abominable monster on the rampage opus told its tale by means of 'found footage' recovered from a camcorder. Never did we ever get a clear picture of the gargantuan that transformed Manhattan into a junkyard. Comparatively, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a one quarter 'Cloverfield' sequel with a lot of time squandered on a formulaic hostage thriller. Synthesize the 'Room' with 'War of the Worlds,' and you've got the gist of the Josh Campbell & Matthew Stuecken screenplay. If you're looking for a full-blown sequel to 'Cloverfield,' you're going to be disappointed. If you looking for two short films edited together, you might like '10 Cloverfield Lane.' Audiences that want to see monsters are going to feel cheated, and audiences that want to see a fresh hostage crisis are going to be bored. An attractive twentysomething gal leaves her boyfriend, packs her stuff, and hits the road. Later, after dark, as she is cruising down the highway, somebody out of nowhere smashes into her and she passes out. We neither know who did it nor what did it.When poor Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of 'Final Destination 3') regains consciousness, she finds herself held captive by a hulk of a man. Howard (John Goodman of 'Argo') served in the U.S. Navy, behaves like a survivalist, but has a sense of humor. She struggles to escape, but Howard thwarts her every attempt until the grand finale. At one point, I thought '10 Cloverfield Lane' was going to be an immaculate, brightly illuminated version of 'Saw.' For example, after we meet Howard, we discover that he doesn't seem to be such a bad sort. Apparently, he went out of his way to rescue Michelle and then nurse her back to health. He has built an underground bunker equipped with all the luxuries that one might require to endure a long period isolation from everything above ground except the fresh air that his filtration system keeps clean. Moreover, Howard has taken in another individual for the duration. Country boy Emmett (John Gallagher Jr. of 'Jonah Hex') would have been a track star at a nearby university if he'd gotten on the bus and gone. Instead, he backed out at the last minute. Overall, Emmett turns out to be the most sympathetic character. Roughly three-fourths of the 105 minutes in '10 Cloverfield Lane' takes place underground, and things grow as claustrophobic as they do tiresome. Mind you, rookie director Dan Trachtenberg and his writers have made the two captives smarter than the average victims. The problem is that he keeps these three characters confined for far too long before we discover that Howard is not only a lunatic but also a liar. Howard has no idea what is happening outside, but he warns Michelle and Emmett that harmful chemical fallout awaits them if they venture outside. Michelle hatches an escape plan for Emmett and her to escape confinement. At this point, things take a murderous twist, and our heroine must rely entirely on her own resources to escape with her skin.Suffice to say, the last quarter hour yields '10 Cloverfield Lane's' biggest surprise and it has a lot to do with 'Cloverfield.' My chief objection to this movie is that I got tired of the drawn out bunker episode. Indeed, suspenseful moments crop up, but some moments don't make sense. We get acquainted with the three characters, and we begin to see the flaws in nice guy Howard's character. If you've seen one hostage movie, however, you know that nothing ever ends well. Watching '10 Cloverfield Lane' was as bad as watching the 2002 Jodie Foster thriller 'Panic Room.' At least 'The Panic Room' had some comic relief. Ultimately, as shrewd as the two hostages are in '10 Cloverfield Lane,' nothing about them is charismatic. The writing is above-average, but the story is far too predictable. For example, in one scene, we watch as Michelle is caught between a rock and a hard place. She manages to escape, and she is at the last barrier when a crazy woman with a blood-speckled face begs to be let into the bunker. Howard convinces Michelle that the contaminated outsider will kill them all with her tainted flesh. Michelle relents, and Howard doesn't chain her up again as he had done earlier.Of course, once our heroine not only figures out a way to break out of the bunker, but also keep Howard at bay, the rest of '10 Clovenfield Lane' turns into a radically different movie. Relief degenerates into abject terror, and Michelle confronts a predator that makes Howard look like the syndicated Hanna-Barbera purple cartoon hippo character Peter Potamus. In the remaining quarter of an hour, our heroine dispatches this new adversary, and suspense mounts during that final fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, it looks like Trachtenberg and his scenarists were so desperate to slough off the initial 80 to 90 minutes of their grimly realistic, but hopelessly tedious hostage drama that they tried to shoe-horn in an episodic sequel to 'Cloverfield.' 'Cloverfield' was feculence from fade-in to fade-out, and '10 Cloverfield Lane' appropriates the narrative thread at the last minute to give audiences a cheap shock. Not even an actor as watchable as John Goodman can salvage this monstrous misfire of a movie.",1,32,64,11 March 2016
3:10 to Yuma," This Remake Is A Pale Imitation of the Original '3:10 to Yuma'
","'Walk the Line' director James Mangold's noisy, violent, bullet-riddled remake of the classic 1957 Glenn Ford western '3:10 to Yuma' won't spur a revival of western movies. If you've seen the Columbia Pictures version with Van Heflin as the desperate, drought-stricken rancher who keeps Glenn Ford at gunpoint and manages to get him to the train on time, you'll see why even the best intended remakes are doomed to failure. Naturally, Mangold and his writers have punched up the action with gratuitous gunplay galore. A sturdy cast has the acting credentials to pull it off, but the characters that they play are overwritten. We're supposed to cry for the misguided villain because his parents abandoned him as a youngster. Meanwhile, the crippled hero worries about everything, especially that his son no longer worships him. Worse, the gloomy ending for the new '3:10 to Yuma' will disillusion anybody who prefers to feel good at fade-out. Perhaps the DVD will contain a suitable alternate ending. Anything resembling subtlety and suspense is absent from this pretentious western, too. The only reason to watch '3:10 to Yuma' is to brag that you've seen a big-screen western. As a remake, '3:10 to Yuma' needs to be put out of our misery. As a western in general, '3:10 to Yuma' scrounges few of the sterling qualities that distinguished sagebrushers like 'Silverado,' 'Unforgiven,' 'Tombstone,' and 'Open Range.' The people that produced '3:10 to Yuma' fix up a classic that needed no alterations. A small-time cattle rancher at the mercy of inclement weather struggles to preserve his herd despite a shortage of water. Mangold and his writers up the ante so that heroic Dan Evans (Christian Bale of 'Batman Begins') must not only contend with an evil landlord who wants his property because the railroad will cross it but also with the inhospitable weather that is killing his cattle. This landlord subplotnot in the originalresembles on a small scale the Sergio Leone classic 'Once Upon a Time in the West' about a widow with property that refuses to sell out to the railroad. Meanwhile, infamous outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe of 'The Quick and the Dead') wages a war against the Butterfield Railroad. He has robbed their payroll stages over twenty times when he isn't sketching pictures of birds and naked babes.As the film unfolds, the Wade gang waylay a Butterfield stagecoach equipped with a Gatlin gun. A Gatlin gun amounted to the nineteenth century equivalent of an Uzi. Historically, a Gatlin gun could deliver up to 600 rounds a minute. Although the good guys possess superior firepower, they don't have the expertise with the gun to vanquish the enemy. Clearly, Mangold borrowed this convention from big dumb action movies where nobody but a hero can hit anything with a machine gun. In the Glenn Ford version, the Wade gang held-up a stagecoach, and the villain shot only one man, the stagecoach driver after he took one of the Wade gang hostage. Nonetheless, in this remake, the entire scene recycles the gimmick from the John Wayne western 'The War Wagon' where an steel-plated wagon with a Gatlin gun in a turret transported the gold shipments. Unfortunately, the 'Yuma' stagecoach doesn't boast a turret to house its rapid fire weapon. When his army of gunslingers cannot stop the stagecoach after basically killing everybody on board, Wade steps in and stampedes a herd of cattle to halt the coach. As it turns out, the cattle belong to our hero.After the robbery, Wade and his gang ride into town. Later, they split up, but Wade malingers in the local saloon to sketch a saloon girl, Emmy Nelson (Vinessa Shaw), in the nude. When the posse returns to town, they get the drop on Wade with Dan's help. Penniless Dan jumps at the chance to escort the outlaw to Contention for the prison train to Yuma. The pay outweighs the risks, so Dan assists the authorities. Along the way, Wade offers our hero a bribe for his freedom, but Dan Evans proves incorruptible. The two suffer through an agonizing wait for the train in an upstairs hotel room while Wade's gang assembles outside with everything that they have to rescue their boss.Mangold, who helmed 'Copland' with Sylvester Stallone and 'Identity' with John Cusack,' is no slouch as a director. However, he clutters up a simple story with far too much exposition, additional characters, and unwarranted violence. '3:10 to Yuma' dangerously borders on burlesque with its high body count. They could have renamed it 'The Thick Red Line.' The glut of violence dilutes what little moral ambiguity survived from the first film. Whereas the Glenn Ford original was a polished, spartan effort brimming with intensity to spare, Mangold's version of '3:10 to Yuma' leaves little to the imagination. Of course, today's audiences abhor westerns, so Mangold exaggerated the violence to compensate for the harsh realism. The hero displays only a trace of humanity; instead, he emerges as a tragic figure of epic proportions, hounded by his own upstart 14-year old son who refuses to obey his father at every turn. Make no mistake; Christian Bale gives it everything that he has in a bravura performance. Sadly, his character is so grim that you cringe at the sight of him rather than sympathize about his plight. Ben Foster excels as trigger-happy Charlie Prince, Wade's second-in-command, who kills without a qualm. Russell Crowe brings his hulking physical presence to bear, but he generates none of the charisma that Glenn Ford conjured up to win audience sympathy. Crowe comes off as a tactless lout, an absurd figure who does what nobody would do at the end. While it pales by comparison with the Glenn Ford original, '3:10 to Yuma' fares somewhat better as a western in general.",4,2,7,11 September 2007
The Equalizer," Denzel Delivers!!!
","Although he neither dons a mask nor fires silver bullets, Denzel Washington does virtually everything else that The Lone Ranger would in the Columbia Pictures' big-screen adaptation of the vintage television crime series 'The Equalizer.' For the record, CBS-TV aired 88 episodes of 'The Equalizer' between 1985 and 1989. Acclaimed British actor Edward Woodward of 'Becket' fame toplined this hour-long dramatic series as Robert McCall, a Good Samaritan vigilante who strode the mean streets of New York City. As a former operative with an enigmatic government espionage agency, McCall applied his skills both as a sleuth and a shadow to help desperate people who could turn to nobody else in their hour of hardship. Bespectacled, sophisticated, and erudite, McCall relied on his brains more often than his brawn. Nevertheless, he could surprise his adversaries with swift, physical action when required. Best of all, McCall never charged his woebegone clients a cent for his services. Now, a quarter of a century later, 'Training Day' director Antoine Fuqua and 'Expendables 2' scenarist Robert Wenk have appropriated only the character's name and the show's basic premise. Nevertheless, 'The Equalizer' is a pretty exciting saga. Unlike Woodward's McCall, who was a widower with a son, Washington's McCall is a widower who works at a Home Depot sort of emporium. In adapting the series, Fuqua and Wenk have fashioned an above-average, suspenseful, but wholly outlandish crime thriller that takes McCall back to square one after he left 'the Agency' under mysterious circumstances, but before he established his altruistic private eye business. As much as I loved the television series, I think Fuqua and Wenk have done a splendid job of reshaping it to accommodate two-time Oscar winning actor Denzel Washington, who played reasonably similar characters in both 'Man on Fire' and 'Safe House.' After a car bomb nearly claimed his life while working for an inscrutable government outfit, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington ) has retired to the relative obscurity of Boston, Massachusetts. Everybody knows him now as a jovial, hard-working, mega Home Mart store employee. McCall prefers to immerse himself in a good novel at a nearby diner that artist Edward Hopper could easily have immortalized on canvas. Indeed, the quiet and unobtrusive McCall lives a simple life without anybody to clutter it up, until he befriends a naive, 16-year hooker, Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), who hangs out at the same diner when he reads. Teri is not a conventional hooker, but prostitute who works for the local Russian mafia. Eventually, she offends these brutal dastards that possess all the subtlety of grizzly bears, gets badly beaten up, and lands in the local hospital. McCall is swift to retaliate. He dispatches five tough guys as easily as if he were stomping cockroaches. Typically, before he goes into action, our hero sets the stop watch and then checks it afterward. When he isn't intervening on Terri's behalf, McCall helps an obese Hispanic coworker, Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), achieve his dream of becoming a security guard. Poor Ralphie eats all the wrong foods and lacks discipline until McCall coaches him and transforms the affable oaf. When Ralphie has to quit his Home Mart job to help out his mother (newcomer Luz Sanchez), who is being preyed on at her restaurant by corrupt Boston cops, McCall not only helps them clean up their store but also straightens out the dirty detectives who were extorting cash from her as well as other business owners. Naturally, since Fuqua and Wenk want us to feel sympathetic toward McCall, they pit him against the most psychopathic mob enforcer on the planet. Teddy (Marton Csokas) appears to be a fastidious, dapper, and inoffensive fellow who utters each syllable of each word with hopelessly precise clarity. When he arrives in Boston, the local corrupt cops treat him as if he were a sissy. It doesn't take them long to learn that he is far from effeminate. Teddy behaves like an efficiency expert as he launches his investigation to see who had the audacity to kill five members of his mob. Boston detective Masters (David Harbour of 'The Green Hornet') escorts him to a rendezvous with the local Irish mob boss, Little John Looney (Shawn Fitzgibbon of 'Mystic River'), who displays nothing but contempt for the Russians. By the time, Teddy has smashed Little John to a bloody pulp, Masters has had to gun down both of Looney's heavily-armed henchmen. Teddy scrutinizes anybody who entered the bar where the five Russian gangsters died and kills at least one person who lies to him about the people involved in the incident. Eventually, he figures out by studying surveillance camera footage that Robert McCall is the most likely suspect. As ruthlessly murderous as he is, Teddy isn't prepared to tangle with a man like McCall who is far more merciless.Director Antoine Fuqua is no stranger to action thrillers. His credits include 'The Replacement Killers,' 'Bait,' 'Shooter,' 'Tears of the Sun,' 'Training Day,' 'Brooklyn's Finest,' and 'Olympus Has Fallen.' He stages with style to spare each combat sequence, and he must have relished Guy Richie's 'Sherlock Holmes' movies because he imitates the way that Sherlock inventoried his adversaries when McCall appraises the Russian mobsters. Some of McCall's weapons, including the power drill and the nail-gun, have been used before in 'Lethal Weapon 2' and 'The Driller Killer.' Rated R for strong bloody violence and language, including some sexual references, 'The Equalizer' isn't as gory as it could have been. Nevertheless, Fuqua delivers several memorable action scenes, and Washington is so charismatic you will stand up and cheer as he whittles down the villains. Marton Coskas qualifies as a truly creepy villain, too. Clocking in at 132 minutes, 'The Equalizer' takes its time, leisurely building up to its bullet-riddled, Tarantino-style climax. By the time he has exacted vengeance on these homicidal fiends, McCall emerges as a larger-than-life power who could scare the Grim Reaper.",8,3,10,29 September 2014
The Expendables 2," A Bullet-Riddled Blast from the Past in the Present!!!
","Watching the old-fashioned, larger-than-life, male-bonding epic 'The Expendables 2' is like taking a nostalgic jaunt down memory lane. A gallery of brawny 1980s era, action-hero icons assembles for this testosterone-laden, blood bath that depicts combat on land, sea, and in the air with double-digit body counts. At one point, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis stand shoulder-to-shoulder, armed with automatic weapons, firing fusillades of bullets into wave after wave of approaching bad guys. Joining Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis this time out are two more 1980s era actors: Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Along with these legendary leading men, newcomers Liam Hemsworth, Scott Adkins, and Nan Yu dodge bullets, too. Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, and Dolph Lundgren reprise their roles as Barney Ross's tough-as-nails mercenaries. Just as sentimental as the original 'Expendables,' 'Expendables 2' drums up ten times more carnage and demolition in a remote Bosnian setting. Unlike the original, this ambitious sequel provides Schwarzenegger and Willis with far more substantial roles. While the dialogue consists of amusing one-liners served up over twenty years ago in the advertising campaigns of 'The Terminator' and 'Die Hard,' the screenplay penned by Stallone and '16 Blocks' scribe Richard Wenk qualifies as a standard-issue revenge thriller. Basically, you should prepare yourself for lots of eardrum numbing battle sequences interspersed with soul-searching dialogue scenes among the principals when they aren't in the line of fire. Nothing has really changed aside from a fresh, new setting in Albania that appears scenic in its own grungy way.'The Expendables 2' erupts with a series of slam-bang action scenes that resemble something that 'The A-Team' tried to pull off every week during its five-year run on NBC. Barney Ross and his pals show up in a squalid-looking town in Nepal on a 'do or die' mission to rescue a Chinese billionaire from some nasty extortionists. They careen into the city in military vehicles designed to smash through barriers of any description. These swiftly-moving vehicles have clever names stenciled on them, such as 'knock-knock' and 'bad attitude.' Mind you, it doesn't matter that our heroes are hopelessly outnumbered because they devastate the opposition mercilessly with artillery blasts and bursts from .50 caliber machine guns. At one point, Barney (Sylvester Stallone of 1981's 'Nighthawks') cranks up a motorcycle and wields it like a weapon to bring down a helicopter. Our heroes evacuate in motor-driven boats but find themselves pursued by trigger-happy soldiers in 'Everglades' air-boats armed with mortars. Barney and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham of 1998's '\'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels') recover their seaplane and sweep down out of the sky like the cavalry as the villains are drawing a bead on their comrades. There is even a revelation or two in all this bullet-riddled mayhem that takes Barney by surprise before they make their getaway.After a few beers, Barney runs into the dubiously named Mr. Church (Bruce Willis of 1988's 'Die Hard') who has been waiting for him at the latter's aircraft hangar. Church dispatches Barney Ross and his cronies on 'a walk in the park' mission to crack a safe in a crashed jetliner. Church surprises Barney when he sends one of his own operatives who can open the mysterious safe without atomizing the object. Initially, Barney is flatly against bringing a woman along who he'll have to babysit. As it turns out, Maggie Chan (NanYu of 'Diamond Dogs') allays Barney's anxieties that she won't be able to keep up with the team. Maggie looks extremely lethal in combat against multiple male opponents. Our heroes have no problem locating the wreckage of the jet and minor complications ensue after they find the safe. Unfortunately, everything goes awry afterward, when an army of sadistic villains intervenes, demands those contents, and threatens to execute one of Barney's unit if they don't lay down their arms and hand over what they found in the plane crash. Motivated as much by the loss of one from their own ranks, Barney and company set out in furious pursuit of the villains. An Eastern European crime cartel headed by an appropriately named Jean Villain (Jean Claude Van Damme of 1988's 'No Retreat, No Surrender ') has no qualms about killing. The information liberated from the safe contains the whereabouts of five-tons of plutonium abandoned by the Russians in a derelict mine during the Cold War. Villain and his menacing minions have recruited slave labor from the location population at gunpoint to help them excavate the plutonium.Director Simon West, who helmed 'Con-Air,' 'Laura Croft, Tomb Raider,' and 'The Mechanic,' rarely allows the pace to slow down in this noisy extravaganza, especially when the heroes and villains are blasting away at each other with murderous glee. West and 'xXx: State of the Union' editor Todd E. Miller never unnecessarily linger on a single image. Some of the editing seems almost subliminal. Clocking in at a nimble 102 minutes, 'The Expendables 2' offers double the action with double the stars. 'Lone Wolf McQuade' star Chuck Norris finds himself in the fray and shows that he still possesses the stamina. It is difficult to believe that all these guys, who once battled it out among themselves for box office supremacy, have come together to make such an outlandish but entertaining opus. For the record, Dolph Lundgren's character, Gunnar, has cleaned up his act from the original and is back with Barney and company. Gunnar still picks on agile, pint-sized Jet Li while Barney and Lee bicker with each other about anything and everything. If you saw 'The Expendables,' you know that Lee Christmas had fallen in love with a gal who let her sadistic boyfriend beat up on her. Lee and Lacy (Charisma Carpentar of TV's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') are now a couple. Conspicuously missing from the cast is Mickey Rourke who played Tool in the original. If you loved the original 'Expendables,' you'll love 'The Expendables 2.'",10,4,14,18 August 2012
The Longest Yard," Adam Sandler and company score a touchdown with 'The Longest Yard!'
","The Adam Sandler remake of the classic, bone-crunching, Burt Reynolds' football comedy 'The Longest Yard' captures the rough and rowdy Three Stooges spirit of its 1974 predecessor in virtually every respect, except director Peter Segal doesn't stage the gridiron exploits with the virtuosity that Robert Aldrich did, with Reynolds calling plays opposite veteran Green Bay Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke and former Pittsburgh Steelers great Mike Henry. Nevertheless, this crowd-pleasing, slam-bang rendition of 'The Longest Yard' ranks as the best Adam Sandler farce since 'The Waterboy.' Freshman scenarist Shelton Turner succeeds where most scribes fail in that his inspired update of writer Tracy Keenan Wynn's original screenplay sticks with the previous game plan, smooths out the rough spots in some instances, but deviates only when necessary to conjure up fresher gags. Long-time Sandler fans will spot some of these alterations, especially when Sandler's comic pal Rob Schneider's shows up to perform his 'you can do it' shtick from the sidelines, and Cloris Leachman's hilarious football prison secretary upstages anything Bernadette Peters did in the first time out. The casting here is bullseye perfect, smack down to the smallest detail, specifically perennial villain David Patrick Kelly as the jealous pyromanical inmate who torches one of the team players. Quiet, unassuming 'Babe' star James Cromwell turns in a top-notch performance as the sleazy warden that the late great Eddie Albert (he stole the show as the warden in the original) would stand up and cheer from the grave. Although the new 'Longest Yard' doesn't surpass the first 'Longest Yard,' you'd need a chain marker and a committee of officials to tell the difference.Like the original 'Longest Yard,' the Sandler version opens in the bedroom with a drunken Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler of '50 First Dates') appropriating his girlfriend's sports car for a joy ride and winds up receiving a three year sentence in the can at Allenville Federal Penitentiary in Texas. Warden Hazen (James Cromwell of ' ') pulls strings to get Crewe into his correctional facility, because Hazen dreams of running for governor and believes his prison guard football team will put him into the political end zone. Hazen approaches Crewe and asks him for his help in straightening up his team that hasn't clinched a championship in several years. Initially, Crewe refuses to give Hazen the benefit of his experience because prison guard Captain Knauer (William Fichtner of 'Armageddon') has beaten him repeatedly with his baton and warned him to refuse the warden. After a week in solitary sweating it out in a shack with no amenities, Crewe capitulates and suggests that Hazen schedule a tune-up game between the guards and the convicts. Unlike the original where the guards were just guards, in the remake the prison warden has recruited his guards from college players who missed out. Several familiar faces flesh out these plug-ugly prison guards, notably former Seattle Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth, two-time, NFL Pro Bowler Bill Romanowski, and wrestling legend Steve 'Cold Stone' Austin. At first, Crewe appears at a complete loss until he meets Caretaker (Chris Rock of 'Head of the State') who clues him into who is who behind bars. Initial attempts to recruit team member falter because pro-football banned Crewe from playing because of his alleged point-fixing schemes. Nevertheless, Crewe comes up with players who make the guys in the Burt Reynolds version look like pygmies.Director Peter Segal, who helmed two previous Adam Sandler comedies: 'Anger Management' and '50 First Dates,' never lets the action lag and manages to convey important exposition (narrative information) in a more streamlined fashion. Clearly, he must have seen the first 'Yard,' because his use of split-screen is patterned after what Aldrich did in the original. Wisely, funnyman Adam Sandler doesn't try to one-up Burt Reynolds whose real-life college football career helped his physical performance enormously in the original. There is no scene where the hero tosses a pass through a tire swinging at the end of a rope. No where near as cool and charismatic as Burt was in 1974, Sandler sticks to the game plan that he knows best: wiseacre humor. Sandler's scenes with the glorious Cloris Leachman will be hard to top for any comedian who takes on this project. The repartee between Sandler and a short, conch-eared San Diego traffic cop is fantastic. Everything up to the big showdown on the gridiron is either perfectly rehashed by director Segal, writer Turner, and a strong cast or taken to the next level. Notably good is the way that Segal introduces each player as they join the team for practice. Particularly funny is the inclusion of a Hispanic Hercules whose accent isn't thick enough to require subtitles but the subtitles add to the hilarity of the moment. The only two things that this 'Yard' fumbles are the tension crackling plays, the sports car from the first movie, and the infamous F-word line that surprisingly has been toned-down and rewritten for this PG-13 movie. While PG-13 movies lack the profanity levels of their R-rated counterparts, the Motion Picture Association of America allows on F-word for every PG-13. However, the gag in the original had the cast using the F-Word in the same sentence three times. All quibbles aside, Adam Sandler and company score a touchdown with 'The Longest Yard,' not only as first-rate entertainment but also as homage to the Robert Aldrich original.",9,1,4,21 June 2007
Skyfall," Craig's Best Bond!!!
","The twenty-third installment in the James Bond film franchise 'Skyfall' qualifies as an above-average 007 opus with several surprises. Clearly, this predictable but entertaining thriller ranks as the best Bond for actor Daniel Craig. Previously, Craig acquired his license to kill in 'Casino Royale' (2006) and brandished it again in the lackluster 'Quantum of Solace' in 2008. Oscar-winning 'American Beauty' director Sam Mendes orchestrates the action with distinction. He gives it a polished look with the help of ace lenser Roger Deakins. Nevertheless, he cannot maintain a full head of steam to keep this actioneer from losing momentum in its last half-hour. Furthermore, 'Skyfall' wears out its welcome during its final thirty minutes after serving up some vintage hard-knuckled heroics throughout its preceding two hours. Mendes does a good job of staging a rugged fistfight in a skyscraper in Shanghai, another knock-about brawl in a casino, and an early shoot-out scene at the arch-villain's hideout where 007 turns the tables on him. Daniel Craig's James Bond struggles to stay at the top of his game after recovering from a near-death experience. 'Skyfall' concerns James Bond more than his boss M. Scenarists Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan provide us with several insights about Bond's life before he joined MI6. Whether he is clinging to the bottom of an elevator ascending a towering skyscraper, scrambling after a subway train as it hauls out of the station, or swapping blows with an adversary atop of a speeding train racing into and out of tunnels, 007 survives by the hair of his chin. Comparably, 'Skyfall' resembles 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' and 'License to Kill.' Not only does 'Skyfall' shun the usual puns, but it also avoids romantic entanglements. Bond shares the shower with one gal and flirts with another who enjoys shaving him with a cutthroat razor. Primarily, Her Majesty's best espionage agent spends most of his time under pressure to save his immediate superior M from an insane villain who resembles the villain in 'Law Abiding Citizen.' Judi Dench makes us feel M's pain but admire her pugnacity. 'Skyfall' is surely her finest hour in Bondage. Ralph Fiennes makes a solid impression as M's rival. 'Skyfall' unfolds in scenic Istanbul as 007 (Daniel Craig of 'Cowboys & Aliens') discovers that the top-secret hard-drive from a laptop computer belonging to a British agent has been stolen. Bond pursues the killer, Patrice (Ola Rapace of 'Beyond'), with the help of another MI6 operative, Eve (Naomie Harris of 'Miami Vice'), who knows how to maneuver a truck through traffic gridlock. When Eve tries to cut off the elusive Patrice, Bond seizes a motorcycle and careens in close pursuit after him. Patrice ditches his motorcycle and leaps from a bridge onto a train. Bond follows him over the edge. Like Titans, they rain blows down on each other from the roof of the train. Eve lines them up in her gun sights. Since she cannot get a clean shot at Patrice, she refuses to pull the trigger for fear of hitting Bond. Back at MI6 HQ, an impatient M (Judi Dench of 'J. Edgar') prompts Eve to take the 'bloody shot.' Eve's bullet slams into Bond rather than Patrice. Bond plunges from the train into the depths of a river below to be swept off in the rapids. The elaborate credit sequence that ensues is one of the more surreal since it depicts Bond's near-death experience. Later, M learns that the hard-drive contains the names of all NATO agents who are deep undercover in various terrorist organizations. Miraculously, Bond survives the high fall, and chills on the beach before duty propels him back to London to help M sort herself out of her darkest hour. The interval in Bond's life is glossed over by the filmmakers. Mind you, this is James Bond at his most vulnerable, but he suffers a worst fate than this in 'Die Another Day' at the hands of the Koreans. Nevertheless, 007 doesn't shuffle off this experience quite so easily. He is definitely damaged goods when he returns for active duty. Meantime, one of M's former operatives from her tenure as the head of Hong Kong bureau has gotten his hands on the hard-drive. This peroxide blonde madman, Silva (Javier Bardem of 'No Country for Old Men'), emerges M's worst nightmare. Silva is as deadly as he is deranged. He plans to release the names of these embedded agents if MI6 cannot thwart him. Silva has an ax to grind with M because she sacrificed him to the other side in exchange for six agents. Silva shares with her how the lethal cyanide capsule didn't kill him. Meanwhile, M has to contend with an unhappy Prime Minister, Clair Dowar (Helen McCrory of 'Hugo') who questions the necessity of British Intelligence in the wake of this debacle. This is about the time that Silva and his gun-wielding henchmen burst in with guns blazing!'Skyfall' completes the reboot begun with 'Casino Royale.' Not only does this movie bring back M's secretary Miss Moneypenny, but it also recalls Q (Ben Whishaw of 'Cloud Atlas'), the quartermaster who dispenses Bond's gadgets. Unlike the classic 007 capers where our hero could count on a clever gadget to bail him out of any tight spot, 'Skyfall' provides Bond with a radio transmitter to keep track of him and a pistol designed so only he can fire it. The Scotland scene is looks like something out 'Home Alone,' but 'Skyfall' gives a good send-off to James Bond's Aston Martin from the Sean Connery years. Oscar winner actor Javier Bardem is fiendish as the arch-villain. Sadly, he goes out with a whimper instead of a bang. Although it is dramatically intensive, 'Skyfall' cannot compete with the best Roger Moore 007 outing, but looks more like a Bond caper after 'Casino Royale' and 'Quantum of Solace.'",9,1,11,10 November 2012
The Hangover," 'The Hangover' Is A First-Rate Howler!!!
","'Old School' director Todd Phillips finds himself in fine form once again with a farcically funny, guys-gone-crazy, hootenanny 'The Hangover,' the flip side of the darker 1998 Christian Slater facsimile 'Very Bad Things.' Starring Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Heather Graham, this side-splitting Sin City 'lost weekend' gives new meaning to the old adage 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.' A riotous, rip-snorting, R-rated, road-trip comedy from fade-in to fade-out, this opus about three groomsmen and a bachelor sowing wild oats takes many unexpected twists and turns throughout its hysterical 99 minutes to keep you laughing long after the end credits. 'Four Christmases' scribes Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who also penned 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,' have concocted a fresh, funny, and far-out misadventure that consistently delivers laughs based on the comic formula of incongruity. Our sympathetic heroes spend the entire time behind the eight ball dealing with one trial and tribulation after another so outlandish that you cannot help by howl at each new revelation.Doug Billings (Justin Bartha of the 'National Treasure' movies) is due to wed his wealthy fiancée Tracy Garner (Sasha Barrese of 'Legally Blonde') in two days. Before he gets hitched, Doug's two best buddies—school teacher Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper of 'He's Just Not That Into You') and dentist Stu Price (Ed Helms of 'Semi-Pro')—along with Tracy's weird brother Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis of TV's 'Tru Calling') take him to Vegas for a last-minute blow-out. Tracy's father Sid (Jeffrey Tambor 0f 'Hellboy 2: The Golden Army') hands Doug the keys to his classic Mercedes convertible and entrusts its care to him. Sid admonishes Doug not to let Alan get behind the wheel, and Doug and his cronies hit the road for Caesar's Palace. No sooner do they arrive than they alter their plans. First, they check themselves into an expensive $4, 200 a night villa. Second, they ascend to the roof to toast Doug's future with shots of Jagermeister. Third, cretinous Alan laces their liquor with Rohypnol or roofies, a date-rape drug that he mistakenly believes is Ecstasy so they can really enjoy themselves.Phil, Stu, and Alan awaken the next day to a trashed villa. Alan waddles off to take a whiz and discovers that a real-live tiger—stripes, claws, and all—is lounging in their bathroom. Our heroes regroup and deduce that they have spent the wildest weekend of their lives. Phil wears a medical bracelet from his night in the emergency room where doctors treated him for a concussion. Not only has Stu lost one of his front teeth, but he has also lost his mother's Holocaust ring that he planned to give to his girlfriend Melissa (Rachael Harris of 'The Soloist'), when he proposes marriage to her. Incidentally, Melissa believes the boys are enjoying a wine tasting weekend in the woods rather than a bachelor party in Vegas. Nothing really awful happens to Alan because he qualifies as his own worst enemy. Alan discovers, however, that they have an infant in their closet. When the guys descend to the parking lot for their Mercedes, they are surprised when the valets whip a Las Vegas police cruiser up to the entrance for them.Principally, our heroes remember nothing from the previous eight hours thanks to the roofies. Worse, they find neither hide nor hair of Doug. Indeed, Doug has vanished. Phil, Stu, and Alan set out to retrace their evening's revelry in an effort to recover Doug. Stu learns he has married a stripper, Jade (Heather Graham of 'Say It Isn't So'), who is wearing his mother's Holocaust ring, while a couple of Asian thugs want to pound them into the pavement for stealing $80-thousand from their whiny boss, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong of 'Role Models'), who has lost his dough as well as his duds.Todd Phillips relates most of this madcap merriment in flashback. No stranger to comedy, Phillips also helmed 'School for Scoundrels' and 'Road Trip,' and he keeps the humor in high gear. One of the funniest scenes finds our hapless heroes making a deal with the Las Vegas Police to drop their grand theft auto charges if they participate in a tazer demonstration. The LVPD let elementary school aged children tazer them. Eventually, our heroes find Doug but they also have to tangle with Mike Tyson as well as Doug's testy fiancée. Tracy demands unequivocally that they haul themselves back to L.A. for the wedding. Predictably, our heroes damage Sid's priceless Mercedes and snap scores of incriminating photos of themselves at play. Unlike 'Very Bad Things,' 'The Hangover' will keep you doubled up in hysterics!",10,10,18,7 June 2009
Iron Man 3," Third Time Is The Charm!
","As superhero spectacles rate, 'Iron Man' qualified as an instant classic. Sadly, 'Iron Man 2' was pretty scrappy. Happily, 'Iron Man 3' surpasses its lackluster predecessor. Although it cannot top the original, 'Iron Man 3' still ranks as remarkable. The narrative is easy to follow, and the villains are a lethal lot with a secret about them that enables them to initially gain the upper hand against our hero. Not only does 'Iron Man 3' serve as a sequel to 'Iron Man 2,' but it is also a follow-up to 'The Avengers.' Everybody who played somebody in 'Iron Man 2' returns for this entry. Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Lieutenant Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) are back, too. Colonel Rhodes has his own Iron Man suit and he is called 'the Iron Patriot.' Nevertheless, only one Avenger makes a cameo, but you'll have to bide your time until the end credits to catch a glimpse of him. Similarly, neither Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) nor Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) turns up for this threquel. Jon Favreau, who helmed the first two 'Iron Man' epics, has entrusted the franchise now to 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' director Shane Black. Previously known for his violent contemporary crime thrillers, such as 'Lethal Weapon,' 'The Last Boy Scout,' and 'Last Action Hero,' Black imparts a palpable sense of momentum as well as a sense of purpose to this installment. He scored a hit with the Mel Gibson movie 'Lethal Weapon,' while the other two feature-films languished at the box office. Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as the obnoxious but heroic inventor Tony Stark who constantly worries about his romantic interest Pepper Potts. As it turns out, Downey starred in 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' for Black when the actor was struggling to rekindle his career. Prepare yourself for a lot of humor this time out, especially where Tony Stark is concerned. Basically, 'Iron Man 3' feels like an invigorating gust of fresh air. Downey cavorts about in several scenes without his Iron Man armor, and he delivers one of his best performances as the billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. 'Iron Man 3' occurs after the celebrated New York adventure in 'The Avengers.' Although allusions are made to 'The Avengers,' Black and freshman scribe Drew Pearce reveal nothing new about that brouhaha. As if to silence anybody who poses questions about the Big Apple showdown, Tony Stark cringes in agony. Presumably, in an effort to keep him down to Earth, Tony must suffer acute anxiety attacks to make him more sympathetic. Although he wrestles with these anxiety attacks, Tony doesn't shirk his duty to save lives and thwart evil. Fortunately, nobody plays an idiot like Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer in 'Iron Man 2.' Most importantly, 'Iron Man 3' doesn't provide us with a finale where men in cans square off against each other for a do-or-die showdown. Interestingly enough, the premise of 'Iron Man 3' reminded me of Dr. Curt Connors' obsession in 'The Amazing Spiderman' (2012) with growing back amputated limbs. The villains in 'Iron Man 3' engage in a modest variation on this skulduggery. One turns out to be one of Tony's girlfriends from the past, Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall of 'The Town'), a botanist who has grown plants that can grow back severed stems. The other is Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce of 'Lawless'), who founded a think-tank company called Advanced Idea Mechanics with the acronym AIM. Later, Killian hires Maya after Tony dumps her to see her research become a reality. These two are no match for the chief villain, an Osama bin Laden stereotype known only as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley of 'Gandhi') who jams the airwaves with his threatening ultimatum broadcasts and commands an army of suicide bombers. Since Iron Man's identity has never been an issue, the real issue in 'Iron Man 3' is how quickly Stark can suit himself up in his armor. This lively, exciting, third installment makes it even easier for our hero to don his outfit. Remember that idiotic looking suitcase outfit in 'Iron Man 2?' 'Iron Man 3' accelerates the wardrobe change time for our wisecracking hero and does it in a way that amuses us but appears cinematic. If you've seen the trailers for 'Iron Man 3,' you've seen the incredible scene where three attack helicopters blast Tony Stark's palatial residence atop a mountain into the California coastal waters. Actually, Tony brings this disaster down on his head when he challenges the Mandarin to visit him. The other scene that stands out finds out hero trying to rescue more people than he can carry while airborne after Air Force One is blown up. 'Iron Man 3' will keep you glued to your seat with some surprises to keep things interesting. Black and his co-scribe look like they have managed to bring the Marvel Comic book character full circle from the original. This raises the question if Robert Downey Jr. will keep on playing the role. If box office figures are anything to go by, the Marvel people won't let Robert go down the tubes.",9,3,6,15 May 2013
Spartacus," The First Really Big Non-Christian Themed Sword and Sandal Epic
","Actor & producer Kirk Douglas wanted to star as the protagonist in director William Wyler's ancient world epic movie 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of Christ.' Of course, Wyler had other ideas. Basically, Wyler wanted Kirk to play the villainous Roman soldier Messala opposite the Charlton Heston hero. Kirk rarely played second fiddle to anyone unless it was Burt Lancaster. Consequently, since he did not get top billing in 'Ben-Hur,' Kirk Douglas decided to not only star in 'Spartacus,' but he also would produce it. 'Spartacus' was an ancient world epic about a legendary slave who escaped captivity, organized a huge slave army and challenged the Roman Empire. Despite its distant past setting, 'Spartacus' dealt with an issue that at the time of its release that weighed heavily on the minds of America: race relations. The theme of 'Spartacus' was the dignity and freedom that every individual deserves as his or her birthright. Good films can span centuries because they mean something to us. The universal need that all men must be free lies at the heart of this blockbuster film. Indeed, 'Spartacus' represented a liberal, Democratic sensibility.Originally budgeted at $4-million, 'Spartacus' proved to be a costly film with its budget reaching $12 million dollars. Today a medium budget movie runs about that price. When 'Spartacus' came out everybody had something to say about its enormous budget. Ironically, MCA brought Universal-International Studio where Kirk was producing 'Spartacus' for about the same price. 'Spartacus' coined $30-million domestically at the box office and earned $60-million worldwide. This would be the biggest Kirk Douglas project. He turned heads in more ways that one. He allowed Hollywood Ten blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo to use his name on the credits for the first time. Trumbo had been blacklisted by the anti-Communists in Hollywood and Washington so that he could only pen scripts under a pseudonym. Mind you, he wound commanding lesser salaries as a result of this problem. Nevertheless, Douglas and Trumbo argued about the script because Douglas—a zealous Zionist—wanted 'Spartacus' to reflect the travails of the Jewish people. Trumbo was more interested in how 'Spartacus' reflected modern-day politics and the Cold War.The version of 'Spartacus' that most will watch is the restored version with the notorious 'oysters and snails' scene between Sir Laurence Olivier and pop cult icon Tony Curtis. You will probably never be able to think about 'oysters and snails' in the same light after you see 'Spartacus.' Religious groups complained about this scene with its conspicuously obvious language about bisexuality. Indeed, this movie is as secular as most standard issue Italian muscleman movies. British actor Peter Ustinov won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role. Lenser Russell Metty's widescreen photography received an Oscar, but Kubrick actually composed most of the shots while a disgruntled Metty sat nearby. 'Spartacus' also won Best Costume Design Oscar and the Best Art Direction and Set Decoration Oscar. 'Spartacus' received Oscar nominations for Best Editing and Best Music. Meanwhile, 'Spartacus' won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture of 1960.'Spartacus' is an epic adventure about a troublesome Thracian slave, 'Spartacus' (Kirk Douglas of 'Champion'), who is saved from sure death by slave trader Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) looking for new candidates for his gladiatorial training camp. It does not take Spartacus long to make an enemy out of thuggish Marcellus (Charles McGraw of 'The Narrow Margin') who runs the school like a boot camp. Spartacus tries to befriend Draba (Woody Strode of 'Sergeant Rutledge'), but the Ethiopian refuses to embrace him as a friend because he might have to kill him. Batiatus trains gladiators and sells them. However, things change when Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier of 'The Entertainer') shows up with two women and Marcus Publius Glabrus (John Dall of 'Rope') to see a gladiatorial battle. Lentulus doesn't like to pit his gladiators against each other, but Crassus pays him more than enough and Draba and Spartacus fight to the death. The outcome of this hand-to-hand combat scene is surprising, especially Crassus' role of killing the gladiator who tries to scale the walls with a trident and kill him. Lentulus sells Varinia (Jean Simmons of 'The Big Country') to Crassus but Crassus tells him to deliver her to him later. After the gladiatorial duel, Spartacus starts a fight with Marcellus when the latter informs him that Varinia is being sent away. These two struggle, and Spartacus drowns Marcellus in a bubbling hot pot of stew. Lentulus decides to deliver Varinia to Crassus personally, orders his men to suppress the uprising, and hurries off in the cart to Rome with Varinia.Not long afterward, Spartacus launches a revolt against Rome. Along the way, he meets Varinia and they fall in love. Initially, Spartacus and his army try to leave Italy, but their plans are thwarted when two Roman armies try to trap them on the coastline. Spartacus decides to turn his army north and confront Crassus, a wealthy and devious Roman soldier who has become Rome's new dictator. Ironically, Crassus doesn't know what Spartacus looks like so he has Lentulus brought to him. Lentulus reminds Crassus that he saw Spartacus fight the Ethiopian. Mind you, the weakest thing about 'Spartacus' is the lack of hate between Spartacus and his mortal enemy Crassus. Several scenes occur in the Roman Senate with Sempronius Gracchus (Oscar winning actor Charles Laughton of 'The Private Life of Henry VIII') chewing the scenery with John Gavin standing nearby as Julius Caesar. Gracchus and Crassus are mortal enemies, too. About an hour into this 197 minute marathon, Atoninus (Tony Curtis of 'The Vikings') shows up as Crassus' slave who bathes the wealthy Roman. After Crassus' 'oysters and snails' speech, Atoninus flees and joins Spartacus.'Spartacus' is a rare, big-budgeted spear and sandal movie without religious references to Christ, though 'Spartacus' is clearly a messianic hero. Kubrick does a great job of cross-cutting between the speeches given by Spartacus and Crassus to their public.",10,1,3,5 September 2009
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Milla Keeps On Kicking Ass!!!
","Spectacular 3-D visual effects, larger-than-life action situations, and audacious characters make the fifth entry in the 'Resident Evil' franchise a lot of fun. Virtually everybody is referring to 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' as the fourth entry. Basically, with some justification, each is ignoring director Makoto Kamiya's 'Resident Evil: Degeneration.' Mind you, 'Resident Evil: Degeneration' was an animated epic without Alice as the chief protagonist, and it went straight-to-video when Sony released it back in 2008. As far as I'm considered, Sony scraped the bottom of the biohazard barrel with 'Resident Evil: Degeneration.' Nothing about it was remotely memorable. Meanwhile, 'Death Race' director Paul W.S. Anderson returns to the helm with the latest entry 'Resident Evil: Afterlife.' For the record, Anderson directed the original 'Resident Evil' (2002) and has penned all four of the live-action features as well as served as producer. 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' qualifies as a crisp, invigorating, 97-minute actioneer never wears out its welcome. The digital 3-D prints are scintillating to see. When the butt-kicking heroic babe charges the camera and hurls those ninja throwing stars, you want to dodge them. Meaning, Sony Pictures produced the movie in 3-D. Lately, some studios have simply converted a 2-D movie into 3-D, and the movie looks terrible. This is not the case with 'Resident Evil: Afterlife.' This action-packed post-apocalyptic zombie flick unfolds in Tokyo. An outbreak of the T-virus devastates the capital city of Japan. By the time that practically everybody is dead, the Umbrella Corporation posts snipers to pick off wandering zombies. Without warning, the Umbrella snipers begin to die. Of course, Alice with her samurai sword is at work and she brings multiple clones of herself armed with Heckler and Koch MP-5 submachine guns. Initially, she kills close to 500 soldiers at the Umbrella Corporation's underground headquarters and targets the evil Umbrella Corporation Chairman Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts of 'Edge of Darkness') who manages to escape in a twin-engine helicopter with wings. The real Alice sneaks aboard to kill him and he drains her of the mutant resources that the T-virus instilled in her. Basically, Alice goes back to being a mortal. Wesker, who has been infected by the virus, is struggling to control the effects of the T-virus and he needs what has been rolling around in Alice's system. Suddenly, the hover chopper jet that Wesker escaped in from the Tokyo Headquarters crashes on a mountainside. Miraculously, Alice survives. She sets off to find her friends, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter of 'Final Destination') and K-Mart (Spencer Locke of 'Spanglish'), who flew off in helicopters to Alaska to find safety at a place called Arcadia. The catch is that Arcadia is a super tanker operated by the Umbrella Corporation and they capture everybody who left the desert in the previous film 'Resident Evil: Extinction.' The Umbrella henchmen slap a ruby red spider like contraption onto their chests that robs them of their thinking. Claire managed to escape, but K-Mart and over two thousand others were imprisoned to be used in more Umbrella experiments. Alice commandeers a propeller-driven plane, flies to Alaska, and finds Claire. The ruby red spider like device on Claire's chest has wiped out her memory, and she tries to kill Alice when they first met.Together Alice and Claire wind up flying to Los Angeles. The city of Angels stands in cinders and only seven people have survived. They are holed up in a skyscraper prison, and zombies had laid siege to the building. Alice wings her way in and lands on the prison roof. By now, Claire has regained her memory. They meet a sleazy movie producer Bennett (Kim Coates of 'Waterworld'), Bennett's intern Kim Yong (newcomer Norman Yeung), basketball superstar Luther West (Boris Kodjoe of 'Surrogates'), Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta of 'Love Ranch'), aspiring actress Crystal (Kacey Barnfield of 'Popcorn'), and Wendell (Fulvio Cecere of 'Watchmen'). Initially, they believe Alice and Claire have come to fly them to the supertanker Arcadia. The ship is visible from the top of the prison, and they've heard the radio station about safety and food. Of course, Alice has to disappoint them. Nevertheless, Alice is intrigued about the ship. Claire meets her older brother Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller of ABC-TV's 'Prison Break') who has been mistaken for a killer and locked by Bennett and his people. Chris has a way that they can escape from the prison and make it to the coast where they can get transportation to the Arcadia. Eventually, the zombies break into the prison after a Goliath dragging a gigantic hammer smashes his way through the locked gates and comes after Alice. As our heroes struggle to escape from the zombies, they are whittled down by the opposition.Ultimately, the flaw that afflicts 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' and all the 'Resident Evil' sequels is story. The Umbrella Corporation manufactured viral weapons and an industrial spy broke into the corporation's Raccoon City complex and unleashed it. Everybody died but they did not stay dead. They came back from the dead as flesh eating zombies. Not only did the men and women come back as zombies, but also the laboratory animals and mutant laboratory experiments. Since 'Resident Evil,' Alice (Milla Jovovich) has been destroying zombies as well as Umbrella executives who want to carry on business as usual. Anderson hasn't altered that serviceable narrative very much. You can only do so much with zombies unless you are cult filmmaker George Romeo, and Romeo changed zombies in 'Land of the Dead.' Nevertheless, aside from the deadly familiarity that the franchise suffers from, everything else in 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' looks fantastic. Jovovich's gravity-defying antics, the exotic settings, the mandible-spreading zombies, the glossy production values, the George Washington quarters as shotgun ammo, a high body count, and the thumping tomandandy soundtrack make this adaptation of the Capcom survival horror video game a blast to watch.",8,5,13,18 September 2010
Stop-Loss," Soldiers Don't Cry
","'Boys Don't Cry' director Kimberley Peirce's new anti-war movie 'Stop-Loss' (**1/2 out of ****) draws its title from an unfair Pentagon policy that obliges troops to perform back-to-back tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. The chief problem with this ambitious, sincere, but unbelievable protest film is it cannot decide which is more important, exposing an unfair military practice or depicting the trauma of combat veterans reentering civilian life. Meanwhile, despite the unpopularity of the Iraq war, 'Stop-Loss' doesn't lob any grenades at our anti-terrorist objectives in the Middle East. Indeed, its spineless ending goes out of the way to support the larger political consensus for the necessity the war. The strongest that 'Stop-Loss' gets is when the protagonist uses the F-word in his comments about the President as Commander-in-Chief using a loophole to force him to go back to Iraq. Inevitably, 'Stop-Loss' refuses to glamorize the war and cherry picks obvious clichés that filmmakers resorted to in early epics like such as 'The Best Years of Our Lives' and 'Born on the Fourth of July' to make war appear unsavory business.'Stop-Loss' opens with overexposed home video excerpts lensed by U.S. troops in a manner that recalls an earlier Iraq war movie 'Gunnar Palace.' The scene shifts then to a roadblock in Tikrit, Iraq, manned by Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe of 'Flags of Our Fathers'), Sgt. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum of 'Step Up'). Pvt. Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt of 'The Lookout') and Pvt. Rico Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk of 'Haven') and shows them checking vehicles with suspicious passengers. Out of nowhere careens a carload of terrorists shooting up the countryside with an assault rifle. King and company go in hot pursuit and find themselves trapped in an ambush with rooftop bushwhackers firing rifle-propelled grenades. This harrowing firefight at close quarters between U.S. soldiers and terrorists in an urban setting recalls 'Black Hawk Down.' Although several soldiers die in this ambush, Pvt. Rodriguez survives at the loss of his vision as well as an arm and a leg.King's tour of duty is up, and he celebrates going home with his long-time friend Shriver. In their hometown of Brazos, Texas, King receives a Bronze Star for valor along with a Purple Heart from Senator Orton Worrell (Josef Sommer of 'Silkwood') and promises his help in any future endeavors. King is just about to turn in his gear when he learns to his chagrin that the military has decided to extend his term of contract. Meanwhile, Burgess's wife kicks him out of their house and Shriver has his own troubles with his girlfriend, Michelle (Australian actress Abbie Cornish of 'A Good Year'), who wants him out of the Army and into her arms as a husband.King refuses to return to Iraq. When his helpful commander, Lt. Col. Boot Miller (Timothy Olyphant of 'Hitman') tries to confine him to the stockade until their departure date, King beats up his escort and escapes. King decides to call on Senator to make his case. Angry at Shriver, Michelle drives King to Washington, D.C. for his meeting with the Senator. Along the way, they learn about how the courts have intervened on the behalf of the military in all 'stop-loss' lawsuits. Briefly, King visits Rico, now minus half an arm and half a leg in a rehabilitation clinic. Shriver finds Michelle and King on the road and tries to convince him to turn himself in while he still has the chance.Clearly, director Kimberley Peirce and scenarist Mark Richmond of 'Huff' wore their hearts on their sleeves like stripes when they wrote this sympathy for the soldier saga. They have created several interesting soldiers and relatives and win our sympathy and provoke our outrage. King explains at one point that 'stop-loss' was designed to forgo the draft. Eventually, he decides that desertion seems the only alternative. Sadly, rather than forging ahead into turbulent waters with its anti-protest theme, 'Stop-Loss' blows its own retreat to preserve the status quo and its amounts to a message-laden but far-fetched furlough from reality.",7,4,7,2 April 2008
It," A Cacophony of Horrific Claptrap!!!
","The best horror movies rely on subtlety to scare the shenanigans out of you. The worst bombard you with CGI galore, and the fiendish monster's arrival is often heralded by ear-shattering, high-decibel blasts of either music or sound effects. 'Mama' director Andy Muschietti's adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 bestseller 'It' qualifies as half-baked hokum with its mischievous but demonic, fun-house clown and all the standard-issue shivers that ensue. Muschietti goes for the gullet every time he wants audiences to scream like bloody maniacs in this tiresome, overwrought, 135-minute marathon. Indeed, the movie bristles with heavy-handed homages to 80's movies, including earlier King adaptations, such as 'Stand by Me' and 'The Shining,' when it isn't reminiscent of Richard Donner's 'The Goonies' (1985). The blood, gore, and violence is enough to justify its tame R-rating, but 'It' never repels you with offensive sights that would generate nightmares. Interestingly, 'Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984) appeared two years before King's bestseller was published. The 'Nightmare' influence on King is obvious, and the ghoulish clown Pennywise behaves like Freddie Kruger with his razor-tipped gloves. Freddie preyed on his victims while they slept and sabotaged their dreams, while Pennywise preys on them while they are fully awake. The problem is that only children can see Pennywise and the horror that he unleashes. Meantime, a collection of youngsters, nicknamed 'The Losers Club,' who constitute an ensemble protagonist, is the best thing about 'It.' Although they are adolescent, they are not only believable but also charismatic in their aim to destroy Pennywise. Each kid differs from the other so they are a miscellaneous group. Furthermore, the predicaments that they plunge themselves into are exciting until the cretinous clown rears his ugly head. The actors and actress that portray this motley crew deliver credible performances. Indeed, this youthful group hurl themselves heart and soul into tracking down the wicked clown who has been killing children.'It' unfolds during a thunderous storm in October 1988 as an older brother, Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher of 'Aloha'), fashions a boat out of paper and wax paste for his younger sibling Georgie (newcomer Jackson Robert Scott) to sail in the gutter. Georgie is having the time of his life when his boat flounders in a storm drain. Miraculously, a guy dressed as a clown, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård of 'Atomic Blonde') catches the boat. Georgie reaches out to retrieve it, but the clown tears off his forearm and then hauls him into the sewer. Georgie's mysterious vanishing act fuels rumors about a serial killer who slays kids. Bill and his playmates: motor-mouthed Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard of Netflix's 'Stranger Things'), germophobic hypochondriac Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer of 'Tales of Halloween'), Jewish-raised Stanley Iris (Wyatt Oleff of 'Guardians of the Galaxy') befriend a chubby kid, Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor of 'Ant-Man'), who has spent his summer investigating a recurring serial killer in Derry, Maine, that strikes every twenty-seven years. Bill, Richie, Eddie, and Stanley meet Ben after he escapes from the clutches of a trio of bullies led by a sadistic, switchblade-wielding Henry Bowers (Nicolas Hamilton of 'Captain Fantastic') who carves the letter H into Ben's soft, flabby belly. Ben becomes fast friends with Eddie and company, and later they rescue Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs of 'Cops and Robbers') from Henry and his hooligans. Each kid suffers from a ghastly encounter with Pennywise the Clown. The guys accept Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream') into their group, and they set out to destroy the horrific Pennywise.Inevitably, Muschietti and scenarists Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauterman have taken liberties with King's thousand page-plus epic novel. For the record, Fukunaga wrote the film 'Beast of No Nations' about child soldiers fighting a war in an anonymous African nation, while Dauberman penned the infinitely superior horror prequel 'Annabelle Creation.' Whittling the characters down strictly to kids confronting their fears instead of kids as well as adults qualifies as their first editorial decision. The film's stellar box office success has guaranteed a sequel which had been hinted at from the start. If you stick around for the closing credits, you'll see that the film's title has been modified to 'It—Chapter One.'' Comparatively, the flashback-riddled 1990 television miniseries chronicled 'The Losers Club' as both adolescents and adults. Muschietti and his writers have cut the adult counterparts of Eddie and company. Second, they have altered the setting from the 1950s in both the novel and miniseries to the late 1980s. Third, they have swapped around two characters. Instead of Mike Hanlon, Ben has become the group historian who spends his summer in the Derry Library learning about the town's tragic history. In both the novel and the miniseries, Mike Hanlon handled that task. Moreover, Mike was a grown-up when he delved into Derry's past. Fifth, King's novel loosened a monster mash of evil fiends. Not only did Pennywise the Dancing Clown frighten the kids, but also The Mummy, a Werewolf, a 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' gill-man, and Frankenstein's creation got in on the fun. For the sake of simplicity, Muschietti has focused primarily on Pennywise and dropped the other monsters. Furthermore, the kids don't launch silver slugs from slingshots to vanquish their foe in the film. Instead, Mike packs a bolt gun designed to kill animals at his grandfather's farm. Those who have read the novel know that after the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, they got themselves hopelessly lost in the sewer. Beverly decided in the best interests of the group to have an orgy so the guys could come to grips with their hysteria and find their way out of the underground network of sewer lines. Clearly, this scene was left out for obvious reasons. Indeed, 'It' received an R-rating, but the orgy that Beverly orchestrated in the novel was taboo. Altogether, if you want to scream your lungs out every time that Pennywise makes a startling entrance, 'It' is your dish of mindless gobbledygook.",5,1,6,17 September 2017
Casablanca," 'Casablanca' Deserves Cinematic Immortality!
","What can anybody say about this classic film that hasn't been said? Okay, it isn't my favorite World War II Warner Brothers film, but it is a grand movie. Yes, 'Casablanca' is worth watching, and I've lost track of the number of times that I have seen this splendidly made black & white film. Undoubtedly, the Warner Brothers film Casablanca ranks as one of the most famous and most written about commercial films that the studio produced during World War II. Aljean Harmetz dedicated an entire book to this classic romantic melodrama, 'Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca.' Her work is the seminal account about the production of the film. Ironically, according to Harmetz, MGM producer Sam Marx wanted to buy the unproduced play 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison, which was the basis of the movie, but MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer 'didn't think it was worth the money.'Warner Brothers wound up buying the Burnett and Alison play for $20,000 on December 8, 1941. The studio assigned brothers Philip and Julius Epstein to write the script for this 'A' budgeted picture, which they began on March 17, 1942. Howard Koch signed on later to rewrite their material.The American Film Institute noted that the studio hired Robert Aisner as technical adviser, because he had 'served on the Maginot Line and escaped from a concentration camp by way of Casablanca.' According to Harmetz, Koch--not the Epstein brothers--provided the protagonist, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart of 'High Sierra'), with the controversial background of running guns to Ethiopia. 'Casablanca' concerns a saloonkeeper in Casablanca and Ilsa, the wife of Czech resistance leader Victor Lazlo trying to escape to Lisbon. A flashback revealed that Rick and Ilsa had met in Paris and fallen in love. When Hitler's troops entered the city, Rick waited for Ilsa at the train depot, but she did not join him. Instead, Sam, Rick's piano-playing friend, brings a note from Ilsa to Rick. In the note, Ilsa says that she loves him but cannot go with him. Rick is devastated. He and Sam escape from the Nazis, and Rick opens 'Rick's Café Americain,' a bar and restaurant in Casablanca. The establishment has illicit gambling tables in the back. He befriends the womanizing Prefect of Police, Captain Renault (Claude Rains of 'Now, Voyager'), and lets him win at his roulette wheel. Rick's refusal to leave Casablanca when he could easily arrange his own departure puzzles the inquisitive Renault. Rick minds his own business. A rival café owner, Ferrari, who dabbles in the black market, chides him about such a shortsighted attitude. 'My dear Rick,' Ferrari observes, 'when will you realize that in this world, today, isolationism is no longer a practical policy?' In another scene with Renault, Rick replies when Renault cautions him about warning a man Renault plans to arrest with Rick's by now signature line of dialogue, 'I stick my neck out for nobody.' Renault congratulates him for his stance and confides in him that he has never arrested him because Rick does mind his own business. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees from war-torn Europe stream into Casablanca searching for some way to reach neutral Lisbon. Before people can leave French-ruled Morocco, they must show an exit visa signed by a French authority. A smalltime thief named Ugarte (Peter Lorre of 'M') has slain two German couriers and stolen two letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle. Actually, the letters of transit served as a plot device that the Epstein brothers contributed to the screenplay. No such letters of transit existed in real life. Anyway, Ugarte entrusted the exit visas to Rick for safekeeping. In search of the visas, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman of 'Spellbound') and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid of 'Now, Voyager'), walk into Rick's bar. Ilsa recognizes Sam and persuades him to play an old tune 'As Time Goes By.' Reluctantly, Sam plays it, only to have an outraged Rick storm in and reprimand him for playing the song that he had ordered Sam never to play again. Ilsa intervenes, but Rick wants nothing to do with her, not after the way she deserted him in Paris. Rick is surprised when he learns from Ilsa that she had been married before they met, but she had believed at the time that her husband had died in a Nazi concentration camp. She explains that her spouse's surprise appearance prompted her to break her date with Rick. Ilsa tells Rick that Victor and she are desperate to reach Lisbon, but they lack exit visas. German Major Strasser threatens to arrest Victor. The resistance leader reminds him, 'You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France.' Ilsa suspects that Rick has the letters of transit. Desperately, she threatens him with a gun, but knowing she could not shoot him, he ignores the gun. Later, Rick forces Renault to come to the airport where Ilsa and Victor appear. Forcing Renault to cooperate, Rick gives the letters of transit to Victor and Ilsa. At the last minute, Strasser appears at the airport and tries to detain Ilsa and Victor. Rick shoots Strasser. 'Well, Rick,' Renault observes, 'you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.' He and Rick watch as the plane lifts off with Ilsa and Victor on board. The film ends as Renault and Rick walk off into the fog, and Rick says, 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' Director Michael Curtiz never lets the action slacken. He stages everything with this customary efficiency. His use of shadows is good. The only flaw in 'Casablanca' is the treatment of Sam. Spike Lee could rattle some cages over Sam's treatment. Rick sells the club without a word with Sam.",10,2,4,15 June 2008
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Fang-tastic!!!
","Rarely does the cinematic adaptation of a novel surpass its literary source. Happily, 'Wanted' director Timur Bekmambetov's 'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter' proves the exception to the rule. Author Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the epistolary bestseller, also penned the imaginative screenplay. Incidentally, Grahame-Smith forged the monster-mash-up literary genre. In 2009, he spliced elements of a zombie story into a revised version of Jane Austin's classic masterpiece 'Pride and Prejudice.' The result was the 'New York Times' bestseller 'Pride & Prejudice and Zombies.' The author then wrote 'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter' and added vampire slaying as Lincoln's covert pastime. Compared with Grahame-Smith's 2010 bestseller, the celluloid version of 'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter' is ten times better. Primarily, Bekmambetov's chiller dispenses with all the plodding biographical parts of Grahame-Smith's bestseller and boasts a thoroughly evil villain as the eponymous hero's chief adversary. Anybody who has read the novel knows that the journal Lincoln keeps about his efforts to eradicate fangsters is what prompts a 21st century writer into reassemble Lincoln's real life with his fantasy exploits. Meantime, Berkmambetov and Grahame-Smith take a serious approach to their outlandish subject matter. Nothing about the vampire hunting deeds of Lincoln is depicted with a wink and a nudge. If you saw director Tim Burton's abominable 'Dark Shadows,' neither Burton nor Grahame-Smith treated the venerable Gothic day-time soap opera with anything resembling either respect or sobriety. Instead, 'Dark Shadows' owed more to Burton's 'Beetlejuice' than Dan Curtis' soaper. Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith didn't commit the same mistake.'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter' unfolds in the year 1818, in Indiana. Our hero (newcomer Lux Haney-Jardine) witnesses first-hand the evil of slavery. One of young Abe's friends, William Johnson (Curtis Harris of 'Touched'), is lashed by a slaver after the youth struggles to prevent his family from being split up and sold down river. Lincoln's father intervenes, and his boss, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas of 'Æon Flux'), fires him and then demands immediate payment of his debts. The defiant Lincoln refuses to pay up. Later, that night, Barts slips into their isolated wooden house and bites Nancy Lincoln. Young Abe witnessed this murderous deed and vows to avenge his mom's demise. The legendary rails splitter has grown up considerably when he tries to kill Bart by shooting him at point blank range with a cap and ball black powder pistol. Miraculously, at least to Abe's way of thinking, his quarry survives the bullet that lodges permanently in his right eye. Barts retaliates, but another individual, Henry Sturgess ((Dominic Cooper of 'Captain America: The First Avenger'), comes to Abe's rescue. Lincoln manages to escape, and Sturgess explains why Barts didn't bite the dust. Thereafter, Sturgess trains Lincoln in the art of killing vampires. Since our hero is an incredibly terrible marksman, he falls back onto his own weapon of preference—an ax. Lincoln accepts Sturgess' Vampires 101 tutelage, but the lessons come with a condition. Lincoln must kill other vampires who constitute a greater menace before Sturgess will allow him to dispatch with Barts.Abe relocates to Springfield, Illinois, becomes a clerk in a general store and studies law in his spare time when he isn't slaying vampires. Of course, nobody can know anything about his secret. Lincoln's best laid plans backfire when Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of 'The Thing') enters the store. Abe doesn't classify himself as a ladies' man so he is surprised when Mary takes an interest in him. Abe's employer and best friend, Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson of 'Zodiac'), wrangles them an invitation to a dance where Abe meets Mary again. Despite Henry Sturgess' warnings that Abe should shun companionship since it might interfere with his nocturnal hunting, Abe starts dating Mary. Meanwhile, Abe carries out Henry's orders and becomes such a proficient vampire killer, eventually slaughtering Jack Barts, that he arouses the wrath of the oldest of all vampires, Adam (Rufus Sewell of 'Dark City'), who lives in the South. Adam exploits Abe's friendship with William (Anthony Mackie of 'Real Steel'), who is still searching for his relatives. Adam invites Abe and William to his Louisiana Plantation, and plans to eliminate the vampire hunter. Of course, Abe thwarts Adam's plans, wipes out a number of vampires, and then marries Mary. He embarks on his prestigious career as America's president until Adam and vampires join Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy.'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter' is the first time Hollywood has appropriated a venerable figure such as Lincoln since the 2001 spoof 'Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter.' The concept that Lincoln carried out cold-blooded executions of vampires during the 19th century would turn anybody's head, including Mr. Lincoln. The discrepancy between the real-life warrior and his audacious literary alter-ego may be more than some audiences can overlook. Mind you, 'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter' doesn't turn Lincoln into a figure of ridicule. Tastefully, Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith have refrained from covering all the tragedy in Lincoln's life during his tenure in the Oval Office. Unlike the novel, the film wraps up everything before Lincoln accompanies his wife to the Ford Theater. The writer and the director have eliminated anything that doesn't propel the action forward, and they have replaced dull scenes with exciting ones. You won't find the flaming trestle that a munitions train must cross, and the novel lacks a central villain. Happily, Rufus Sewell delivers an impeccable performance as the chief vampire villain. The vampires appear rather frightening. Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith have conjured up some new rules that aren't universal for the genre. First, vampires can rough up other vampires, but they are not allowed to kill each other. Second, these vampires can become invisible in the blink of an eye. Third, the secret weapon that our heroes must stockpile to thwart their evil designs is silver. A human can drop a vampire stone-dead in its tracks with a silver bullet. Although it clocks in at 105 minutes, 'Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter' never wears out its welcome.",10,2,5,8 July 2012
Minority Report," Tom Cruise makes a convincingly vulnerable hero . . .
","You know that a science fiction film, like the new Steven Spielberg movie 'Minority Report' starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell, is in trouble when the background elements are more interesting than the foreground elements. Based on a sci-fi short story by legendary author Philip K. Dick, whose writings have inspired Gary Felder's 'Impostor' (2001), Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' (1982), and Paul Verhoven's 'Total Recall' (1990), 'Minority Report' tops the inept 'Impostor' but lacks the exciting agility of either 'Total Recall' or 'Blade Runner.' While the 'what if' premise of the Philip K. Dick short story and the script by Scott ('Get Shorty') Frank and newcomer Jon Cohen provokes thought, director Steven Spielberg bungles both premise and promise. Not only does Spielberg wear out his welcome with an exhaustive epic that runs a half-hour too long, but also he botches what could have been the equal of any of his action-packed 'Raiders' trilogy or 'The Lost World.' Quite simply, 'Minority Report' degenerates into a shallow, derivative sci-fi saga that bogs down too often in its own pseudo-technical gibberish and never delivers the hallowing hair-raising heroics that it promises. 'Minority Report' unfolds in Washington, D.C., in the year 2054. Over the past six years, nobody has murdered anybody, thanks to a pioneering crime-prevention program called 'Pre-Crime' that can predict a homicide before it happens. Inventors Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow of 'The Exorcist') and Iris Hineman (Lois Smith of 'The Pledge') devised this system that relies on three psychics (one woman and two men) called 'Pre-Cogs' buoyed in a wading pool who have visions of future crimes. The Justice Department dispatches Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell of 'American Outlaws') to check out the system before they adopt it for nation-wide use. Witwer suspects the system is flawed, no matter what Pre-Crime Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise of 'Vanilla Sky') claims to the contrary. Suddenly, Anderton finds himself in a predicament when the Pre-Cogs say he has murder on his mind. Anderton is supposed to kill somebody that he has never met in the next 36 hours. Predictably, Anderton runs. Not only does he resist arrest, but also he kidnaps one of the Pre-Cogs, former crack-baby Agatha (Samantha Morton), who insists that he would kill and run. Along the way, we learn Anderton lost his son; uses illegal drugs, and is divorced.Spielberg blows it from the beginning with an action scene that wanders in circles. Things grow worse as the plot thickens, and we learn how the lottery style 'Pre-Crime System' works. At least ten continuity errors crop up, but what is worst is Spielberg never lets the action scenes off the leash. Instead, peripheral elements, such as the Magnetic Levitation traffic system that prevents traffic jams and the 'sick stick' that the cops use to incapacitate wrongdoers by making them instantly vomit, are more interesting than the contrived, drawn- out, convoluted story. Tom Cruise makes a convincingly vulnerable hero, but nothing about 'Minority Report' is as convincing or insightful as his performance.",5,3,5,11 July 2007
G.I. Jane," Gee, I Don't Like Jane
","Actress Demi Moore shaves her head, dons fatigues, and totes a machine gun in British director Ridley Scott's opportune but exploitative 'G.I. Jane,' a sexual equality polemic about the first female to graduate as a Navy SEAL. This lackluster basic training epic serves up a volatile but exemplary message about equal rights and the armed forces that cost the filmmakers the aid of the Department of Defense. When 'G.I. Jane' isn't preaching gender parity, this cynical but slickly done 'Top Gun' clone is gung ho on showing Moore kicking butt in the kind of role her husband Bruce Willis excels. Sadly, 'G.I. Jane's' melodramatic storyline combines with its juvenile heroics to undermine what little credibility it musters as a socially conscious exercise in political correctness.Writers David ('The Fugitive')Twohy and Danielle Alexandra collaborated on what can only be called a prefabricated screenplay. 'G.I. Jane' marches to the familiar beat that has characterized the formulaic military service picture since the 1920s. Movies such as 'Courage Under Fire,' 'Heartbreak Ridge,' and 'Stripes.' have done what 'G.I. Jane' tries to do. Moreover, they have done it better. Basically, the plots and the heroics in military pictures remain the same, only the sex of the hero has changed with 'G.I. Jane.' The Twohy-Alexandra script alternates between Congressional and Naval brainstorming sessions about Lt. O'Neil and the obstacles she confronts at the SEAL training base in Florida. A shrewd but slippery Texas Senator, Lillian DeHaven (Anne Bancroft), cuts a deal with the future Secretary of the Navy Theodore Hayes (Daniel Von Bergan). He'll snag her vote of approval if the Navy opens its elite SEAL commando school to a woman. Secretary Hayes caves in to Senator DeHaven's request, but squirms when she demands approval of the SEAL candidate.DeHaven picks Lt. Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) for her physical agility and her keen mind. O'Neil is the kind of woman who makes men nervous. When we first meet her, she is monitoring a satellite transmission with a commando unit trying to escape from enemy country. She arouses the hostility of her male superior officer when she provides the best solution to the extraction problem. But Lt. O'Neil is not a person easily ignored. Neither Senator DeHaven nor Secretary Hayes expects her to finish the course. After all, Navy SEALs are the most demanding and merciless elite combat force in the world. Sixty percent of the recruits who enter the program wash out.When the press snaps photos of O'Neil on SEAL maneuvers, a controversy erupts in both the Pentagon and Congress. Secretary Hayes and Senator DeHaven sought to keep the project under wraps, but the news wants to interview O'Neil. Suddenly, O'Neil finds herself caught in the middle of a JAG investigation.Guys will relish the last half-hour of 'G.I. Jane.' That's when the bullets start to fly. During a training exercise in the Mediterranean Sea, the SEALs get to help out U.S. troops retrieving a fallen satellite in Libya. This part of the script is straight out of a 'Star Trek' movie because the SEAL recruits are the only force close enough to respond to the situation. Nobody else can rescue these troops, so the Master Chief (Viggo Mortensen) takes his recruits into battle. Unfortunately, things go sour and the Master Chief catches a bullet. He sends O'Neil packing, but she refuses to leave him to his fate. Instead, O'Neil figures out the master chief's escape plan and stages an ambush to wipe out his adversaries. Not since World War II Nazi movies have the enemy been so gullible and easy to kill. These Libyan soldiers present about as much a threat to the SEALs as the Iraqi soldiers did to Charlie Sheen in the 'Hot Shots' movies.Demi Moore knocks herself out as Navy Intelligence officer Lt. Jordan O'Neil. Even her character's name has a masculine quality to it. When Demi isn't trying to impress us with her brains, she displays her feminine brawn. The calisthenics that she performs in her tight undies defy gravity. The one-armed push-ups are enough to make you break into a sweat. All of this resembles the grunge side of last summer's idiotic opus 'Striptease,' except that frontal nudity is avoided. Moore's performance, to her credit here, is both straight-forward and serious even when O'Neil plays toy soldier in the last reel.Veteran actress Anne Bancroft of 'Point of No Return' shines as the crafty Texas senator whose willing to use as well as abuse Lt. O'Neil to save her own congressional bacon. This is Bancroft's juiciest role in years, and she plays it to the hilt. Her best scene with O'Neil has Bancroft's cagey Senator explaining why women in combat will remain a hot issue. According to DeHaven, lawmakers fear the political suicide that television images of dead women being shipped home in body bags would prompt. Director Ridley Scott pulls some slick optical tricks to bolster 'G. I. Jane,' but they don't beef up the action. Jiggling his camera during the combat scenes may create disorientation in audience, but it doesn't trigger a rush of adrenalin. This artsy gimmick doesn't generate either tension or suspense. Anyway, you know that Demi Moore isn't going to get a scratch on her because she's smart enough to dodge the bullets that stupid men are firing at her.Simply, Scott doesn't make 'G.I. Jane' rock and roll. The grueling training sequences are okay, but the final combat scenes resemble Boy Scout antics, compared with even a marginal effort like 'In The Army Now.' Ridley Scott has produced some memorable films that deploy women in gender stretching roles, such as 'Alien' and 'Thelma & Louise.' 'G.I. Jane' boasts none of the art, hype, or viscera of those movies. In the commercially oriented market place, if the next movie doesn't top the last, trouble lies ahead. Compared with last summer's dignified masterpiece 'Courage Under Fire,' 'G.I. Jane' amounts to sheer hokum.",5,22,37,16 September 2009
Training Day," An abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture with a great Denzel performance
","Denzel Washington delivers a dynamic performance easily worth an Oscar as a rogue cop in director Antoine Fuqua's gritty urban crime thriller 'Training Day,' co-starring Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Snoop Doggie Dog, Macy Gray, and Tom Berenger. This unsavory but exciting R-rated law & order melodrama paints a considerably less than flattering portrait of police corruption in Los Angeles. Essentially, scenarist David ('U-571') Ayers has exploited the recent Ramparts police scandal in the L.A.P.D. as the basis for his controversial but contrived screenplay. While he infuses the film with his charismatic personality, Washington goes against-the-grain for a change as a dyed-in-the-wool villain who won't hesitate to double-cross friends. Not only does bad-ass Denzel tote a chrome-plated automatic pistol under each armpit, but also he cruises his asphalt domain in a customized obsidian-black 1978 Monte Carlo. Gear heads will drool over Denzel's ride which doubles as his office. As an extension of Alonzo's amoral character, the Monte Carlo compliments his roguish personality. Sadly, as psychological actioneers rate, 'Training Day' lacks the tenacity that Washington imparts to his warlord-like antagonist. Fuqua and Ayer employ sentimental stratagems to align our sympathies with Ethan Hawke's half-hearted hero who turns wimp in the end. Surprisingly, unpardonable logistics sabotage Fuqua's mise-en-scene, especially in a rooftop foot chase! Further, the filmmakers bank on sheer coincidence to bail out the hero. A 'Scarface' inspired scene as Latino gangsters prepare to ice our hero in a bathtub illustrates the worst of the coincidences. Ultimately, if 'Training Day' constitutes the best Hollywood can offer as a cautionary tale about police corruption, we're all in trouble. Basically, the Darwinian message of 'Training Day' is big-fish eat little-fish, or survival of the fittest, so what does it matter if how criminals buy it in the end if justice is served? As cynical as 'Training Day' tries to portray itself, it winds up as a formulaic but flawed thriller about legal courtroom justice versus street justice.Basically, this abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture does nothing countless other thrillers like Sidney Lumet's 'Serpico' (1973) haven't done better. Specifically, 'Training Day' resembles a white-washed version of director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1994 dirty cop saga 'Bad Lieutenant,' starring Harvey Keitel as a heroin-shooting, trigger-happy, N.Y.P.D. detective in deep trouble with loan sharks. Like the Keitel character, Washington's renegade cop shoulders his share of problems. He has teed-off the Russians (presumably their mafia) during a wild and woolly weekend in Las Vegas, and they want payback. Even Alonzo's police superiors refuse to believe he is anything more than a walking dead man. Alonzo aims to prove them wrong and his narcissism makes him perversely appealing. Some of the problems with 'Training Day' is what we learn about Alonzo's off-screen activities seems more interesting than what we see him do. Take the encounter with the Russians in Vegas. Apparently, Alonzo snapped, killed a guy, and the Russians have dispatched hit men to get him the same way the Colombians nailed Al Pacino in Brian De Palma's 'Scarface.' Nevertheless, Alonzo never loses his cool in 'Training Day,' because he believes he is in control, particularly with regard to a rookie auditioning for the sixth man slot on his elite team.'Training Day' chronicles a 24-hour span in the life of young, idealistic, rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke of 'Dead Poets Society' & 'Hamlet') who wants only to 'protect and serve' the public. Since joining the Los Angeles Police Department 19 months ago, Hoyt has been angling for a big break. Thirteen-year veteran L.A.P.D. Det. Sgt. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington of 'Remember the Titans'), who heads up an elite narcotics squad, provides that break. Harris gives Hoyt the chance of a life-time to prove he can perform undercover without getting himself smoked by a paranoid drug dealer. If Hoyt can make a favorable impression on Alonzo, he assures his young beautiful wife breast feeding their 10-month age, infant daughter they will be bound for a better life.As a typical, formulaic American movie, 'Training Day' relies on rewards and punishment to shape its morality. Hoyt interprets this assignment as his ticket to the big time. Not only is Hoyt in for a rude awakening, but also so is the audience. By the time those fateful 24 hours elapse; Hoyt will emerge as an entirely different person. His saintly ideals will be tarnished as well as his own sense of innocence. Anyway, Ethan Hawke gives an evocative performance, but the actions of his character ultimately undercut the brilliance of his acting. He plays a stereotypical hero who balks at doing what a hero's got to do. Hoyt's last confrontation with Alonzo underlines the weakness inherent in Hawke's character. As the young, hungry cop, Hoyt represents hope, so his refusal to rub out Alonzo smacks more of political correctness than dramatic closure. Similarly, 'Training Day' compares these two characters and reminds us in no uncertain terms who epitomizes good and evil.Director Antoine Fuqua, whose credits include 'The Replacement Killers' and the slick Jamie Fox caper 'Bait,' gives 'Training Day' a sleek, sharp, and snazzy look. Unfortunately, while the movie amounts to a visual feast for the eyes, David Ayer's script degenerates during the second half of the action. The hero stands for law and order, but he refuses to get himself dirty do his job. Clearly, 'Training Day' contends that what you sow, so shall you reap. Anton Fuqua and David Ayer have made a passable film that provides reassurances if the cops cannot take care of corruption, then criminals will.",8,1,2,7 February 2008
John Wick," Wicked!!!
","Never kill an action hero's dog! All hell breaks loose in the sadomasochistic, R-rated, revenge-thriller 'John Wick' because the malevolent villains not only steal our hero's 'to die for' vintage 1969 Mustang, but they also murder his dog. Had these unsavory felons had contented themselves with the Mustang, they might have survived the ordeal. Watching the ferociously violent 'John Wick' rekindled memories of director Antoine Fuqua's conspiracy theory thriller 'Shooter' (2007) where the villains made the fatal mistake of killing Mark Wahlberg's dog. Bob Lee Swagger, the Wahlberg hero in 'Shooter,' cleaned everybody's clock after he buried his dog. Basically, Keanu Reeves does the same thing to the heartless hooligans who slew his adorable puppy. 'John Wick' pits our resilient hero against the malignant Russian mafia infesting New York City like a cancer; much like Denzel Washington did in 'The Equalizer.' Most of the ruffians who died in 'The Equalizer' perished off-screen, and we were shown their twisted bodies sprawled like blood-stained laundry after the fact. Unlike Denzel's sympathetic, good-guy vigilante, Keanu Reeves is cast as a retired Russian hit-man who exterminates everybody in sight without a qualm. Along the way, our hero has his nose bloodied, his ribs kicked in, and stitches sewn up in his stomach. 'Matrix' stuntman turned film director Chad Stahelski has taken scenarist Derek Kolstad's formulaic, B-movie screenplay and fashioned it into a cynical, rapid-fire, actioneer with the double-digit body count of Asian director John Woo's classic 'Hard Boiled.' If you haven't heard of John Woo, then 'John Wick' is comparable to the two Gareth Evans' hard-knuckled, non-stop thrillers 'The Raid' (2012) and 'The Raid 2' (2014). Kolstad's larger-than-life script recalls venerable genre classics like the Lee Marvin shoot'em up 'Point Blank' (1967) and the hard-as-nails Mel Gibson movie 'Payback' (1999). A lone gunman in both 'Point Blank' and 'Payback' wipes out the mob in a metropolitan city. If you cannot tolerate seeing dozens of gunmen getting riddled with bullets, you should skip 'John Wick.' After a string of forgettable, half-baked thrillers and fantasies, including 'The Day The Earth Stood Still,' 'The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,' 'Man of Tai Chi,' and '47 Ronin,' Reeves appears to have recovered his poise with this high body count, pistol opera.The hard-bitten Keanu Reeves title character hung up his hardware after he fell in love with Helen (Bridget Moynahan of 'Battle Los Angeles'), an angel in disguise who saved him from a life of crime. Unfortunately, she succumbed to a fatal illness and died at the hospital with John at her bedside. Before she passed away, Helen has the presence of mind to write a farewell card to her husband and attach it to a pet taxi containing a cute, floppy-eared puppy. Our dry-eyed hero weeps at the memory of his long, lost wife and prepares a place at the foot of his bed for Daisy. One day while Wick is fueling up his Mustang with gasoline, a carload of rude Russians cruise in to the convenience store. One of the Russians, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen of 'Atonement'), admires Wick's ride and asks him how much he would sell it for. 'It's not for sale,' Wick replies without a second thought. When Iosef mutters in Russian that everything has a price, Wick rebuts him in Russian that his Mustang is not for sale. Later that evening, after he has gone to bed alone, Wick awakes as Daisy starts barking and scampers off the bed and downstairs. No sooner has Wick followed Daisy to investigate the disturbance in his sleek, ultra-modern house than he is knocked down and violently beaten up. The three thieves confiscate his car keys, and Iosef kills poor Daisy. Later, Iosef and his accomplices careen into an automobile chop shop run by Aureilo (John Leguizamo of 'Carlito's Way') for new papers and a VIN number. Areola refuses to accommodate them. He goes so far as to punch Iosef in the face. Iosef's father Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist of 'London Voodoo') offers his son a drink and then slams his fist into Iosef's stomach so his son vomits on the floor. Viggo tells Isoef that Isoef has made a fatal mistake. Viggo explains that John Wick consolidated Viggo's empire before Wick retired. Viggo witnessed Wick kill three ruffians in a bar with nothing but a pencil. Unfortunately, we don't see Wick repeat this rather astonishing act. Nevertheless, Wick is a crack shot with any kind of gun and drives a car like a racer. Immediately, Viggo hires the next best hit-man alive, Marcus (William Dafoe of 'The Boondock Saints'), but sets up the contract on a first-come/first-sell basis for anybody. Like I said earlier, all Hell breaks loose, and everybody relies on the same clean-up crew to mop up the blood, bodies, and broken glass.Naturally, 'John Wick' is barely believable. This is a slam-bang, shoot'em up done with a straight face and a cast of familiar faces dodging bullets in New York City. Everybody wears body armor and packs extra pistols. When John Wick shoots an adversary, he puts at least three slugs in each adversary with a coup de grace to the head. Sure, blood splashes from these wounds, but it isn't gratuitous like 'Saving Private Ryan.' Stahelski stages everything as if he were directing a Spaghetti western. Bodies spin, topple, and stagger. Here and there, Stahelski slips in a surprise or two because John Wick may be indestructible, but the Russian mobsters aren't totally asinine. 'John Wick' isn't strictly about guys with guns. Actress Adrianne Palicki shows that gals can be just as lethal with firearms, too. British tough guy Ian McShane of 'Deadwood' fame makes a memorable appearance as the owner of an off-limits nightclub motel who doesn't cater to killers killing killers on his premises. Although it isn't wholly original and is often predictable, 'John Wick' qualifies as a sizzling saga with slimy villains and lots of kinetic, bullet-piercing action.",8,12,29,4 November 2014
Rocketman," His Song!!!
","Taron Egerton delivers an electrifying performance as Elton John in 'Eddie the Eagle' director Dexter Fletcher's 'Rocketman,' a 'warts and all' musical biography about the British singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer who has sold reportedly as many as 250 to 300 million records since his debut on the charts in 1970 with 'Your Song.' Mind you, Elton's debut studio album hit the racks in 1969, but it wasn't released in the U.S. until 1975. Occasionally inspired, often conventionally straightforward, but hopelessly costumed, this cinematic greatest hits revue epitomizes the proverb 'money cannot buy happiness.' This hoary clichÃ© finds refreshing relevance with the eponymous musician's own confession early on in writer Lee Hall's screenplay. Elton boasts that he has done everything, but he has never experienced true love. Now, if you're wondering what he felt about this off-delayed, somewhat contrived jukebox musical fantasy, it should come as no surprise that the five-time Grammy winning piano prodigy adores it. Indeed, Elton produced this two-hour plus extravaganza, with his husband, Canadian filmmaker David Furnish.Elton's biopic qualifies as an important first in movie history for its depiction of gay male sex. Essentially, however, most of these flagrant affections amount to little more than kissing and groping. Sadly, despite the musician's participation behind the camera, 'Rocketman' has yet to achieve the lunar trajectory of Queen's comparatively prudish PG-13 release 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018), with its phenomenal $900 million plus box office haul. Reportedly, audiences criticized 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for sterilizing Freddy Mercury's love life. After watching this rise and fall and then phoenix-like rebirth of the British superstar's life, it seems miraculous that Elton has emerged from the pandemonium of his life and appears now to be at peace at age 72. Elton's second autobiography due out in print October 15th will undoubtedly prove more illuminating.Watching 'Rocketman' is like watching Elton's greatest hits. The first time we see the superstar, he storms into a twelve-step AA meeting, presumably fresh from a concert, decked out as he is like the supernatural monster 'Hellboy' from the Dark Horse Comics. Detaching the horns from his headpiece, Elton collapses into a chair and regales them with his woes. 'Rocketman' chronicles Elton's rollercoaster life, including his bouts with his eating disorders, shopping sprees, and alcohol-fueled orgies energized with prescription meds as well as illegal substances. At one point, as he is topping the charts, Elton realizes he must hush up his secret life as a homosexual. When he outs himself on a pay phone to his serenely aloof mother, Shelia (Bryce Dallas Howard of 'Jurassic World'), she smirks: 'Oh, for God's sake, I knew that. I've known for years.' Like Queen's front man Freddie Mercury, Elton survives a harrowing same sex encounter with a villainous manager, John Reid (Richard Madden of Disney's live-action 'Cinderella'), who warns Elton--whether the latter lives or dies-that he will still reap his 20 percent of the profits. Perhaps a message lurks within for prospective rockers about confusing love with sex. Incidentally, a different actor played the same promoter in 'Bohemian Rhapsody.'Naturally, 'Rocketman' eavesdrops on Elton's early years in flashback when he was shy Reginald Kenneth Dwight and discovered an affinity for the piano at age four. By age eleven, he had landed a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. Clearly, Elton suffered at the whims of his parents who withheld their love and affection. No, they didn't abuse him physically, but the emotional toll was just as devastating to the youngster. The first genuine friendship that he forged turned out to be with his long-time musical collaborator but heterosexual male, Bernie Taupin ( Jamie Bell of 'Defiance'), who penned some of Elton's best lyrics. Apart from a brief hiatus between 1977 to 1979, Elton and Taupin spent more than 30 years together writing songs. Elton boasts that they had only one argument during all those years!Unlike most celebrities who shun the spotlight when it threatens to become too revealing, Elton John told director Dexter Fletcher that he wanted to see as much 'honesty' as possible about his trials and tribulations. At no time did the rock star admonish Fletcher and Hall about unsavory episodes in his life. Predictably, the sexual improprieties have been held to a minimum, but Elton's faithful heterosexual fans have probably resigned themselves to this revelation in a career that has been splashed across the tabloids for almost fifty years. The inevitable turning point in any rock star's life occurs when suicide rears its ugly head in their thoughts. One of 'Rocketman's' insightful scenes takes place during such an instance. During a pool-party orgy with scores of oblivious spectators carrying on without a clue, a bleakly depressed Elton plunges headlong into the surreal blue depths and sinks like a rock. At the bottom of his pool, he finds young Reginald Kenneth Dwight playing his tiny piano. Mind-blowing accurately describes this unforgettable scene.'Rocketman' doesn't cover the entirety of Elton's life. Ostensibly, the last of his greatest hits 'I'm Still Standing' marks not only the conclusion of the film but also the end of a life over 'troubled waters' as he comes to grips with his homosexuality, terminates his heterosexual marriage after two years, and emerges from rehab with a new lease on life. Of course, purists will argue that Fletcher and company have tampered with the chronology of Elton's life. Of course, they have! Nevertheless, they have tried to make his life as sensational as it is tall-all, while eliminating other events which did not contribute to the film. Taron Egerton's vocal performance as well as his bizarre wardrobe changes closely imitate Elton. Altogether, 'Rocketman' qualifies as a blast!",8,2,4,23 June 2019
Gravity," Okay But Nothing Special
","'Children of Men' director Alfonso Cuarón's lost-in-space saga 'Gravity' with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney qualifies as an above average science fiction film. Basically, this authentic looking outer space epic deserves Oscars for its special effects and production designs. Arguably, 'Gravity' belongs to the sub-genre of factual science fiction films like Ron Howard's 'Apollo 13' (1995), John Sturges' 'Marooned' (1969), and Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968). Unfortunately, 'Gravity' suffers from a devastating case of narrative anti-climax. In other words, after the catastrophic opening scene, nothing comparable occurs during its remaining 80 minutes. Worse, the astronaut who survives this disaster turns out to be a dull, tight-lipped individual with no family back on Earth. Despite its white-knuckled gauntlet of predicaments, the thinly-plotted 'Gravity' has little to offer other than some modest thrills when our hero and heroine are walking in space. This straightforward, no-nonsense, claustrophobic thriller boasts a false surprise and a string of unlikely but plausible incidents. Imagine a movie built around a house fire with an individual battling to escape the blaze narrowly before everything burn up, and then put the burning edifice into orbit, and you've got 'Gravity.' Aside from its female protagonist, little about this $100 million outing is fresh. The result is a scenic but second-rate chick flick that relies on pure action rather than plot.'Gravity' takes place about 375 miles above Earth. Astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney of 'Solaris') and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock of 'The Heat') are members of the NASA space shuttle Explorer. They have been dispatched to perform repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. Terror occurs with little warning when Russian space debris from one of their own satellites that they destroyed strikes the space shuttle and kills everybody but Stone and Kowalski. A good ole boy from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, the extroverted but avuncular Kowalski is a veteran astronaut on his final mission before he retires. You can guess what happens to him in 'Gravity.' During her first walk in space, Mission Specialist Stone is conducting the repairs. She has trouble dealing with the zero gravity conditions. Occasionally, she forgets that tools and parts float rather than fall, and she almost loses a part of a board that she is fixing. Stone and Kowalski learn from Mission Control (voice of Ed Harris of 'Apollo 13') that they must abort their mission. The debris of a Russian satellite blasted in space is the equivalent of flying shrapnel that wipes out everybody aboard the Explorer and leaves Stone and Kowalski adrift. Kowalski wears a thruster pack that enables him to save Stone, but they cannot evacuate in the Explorer because the shuttle has been damaged badly. Instead, maneuvering with his thrusters, Kowalski drags Stone with him to the International Space Station. At this point, things take a turn for the worst. Kowalski quotes 'Star Wars' hero Han Solo's popular line: 'I've got a bad feeling about this.' One of the astronauts dies so the other can live and leaves the other to contend with a challenging ordeal. Get back home to tell a whopper of a story or die in space.Anybody who has heard astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson's criticisms about 'Gravity' should bear in mind that it is a Hollywood movie that takes liberties with fact. Tyson would probably have improved 'Gravity' in some small measure had the filmmakers used him as a consultant rather than Dr. Kevin Grazier who has served as an adviser for the SyFy-channel. Intelligent adults who paid to watch 'Gravity' shouldn't be too concerned about the lack of authentic realism that disturbed Tyson. Ironically, even Tyson has gone on record to say he enjoyed 'Gravity.' Meantime, for all its realism, 'Gravity' amounted to something of a letdown for me because it just was more one-dimensional than entertaining. First, neither of the two characters is particularly charismatic. Second, the 3-D doesn't enhance space or the vehicles where our heroes seek refuge. Rarely does 3-D work as it was originally designed, and the glasses are a nuisance from fade-out to fade-in that they hinder you from enjoying a movie. 3-D was designed so you could dodge all the stuff that filmmakers hurled at you to generate a greater sense of excitement. Nothing of consequence flies at you in 'Gravity.' Third, despite some fleeting moments of nail-biting anxiety, you know that once Cuarón and his son Jonas who co-wrote 'Gravity' have whittled down the two person cast (everybody else is a voice) to one that they aren't going to kill the last individual in space. Watching this survivor fool with a fire extinguisher, punch buttons on a console, and cry because nobody briefed this person about how to pray isn't my idea of a good movie. I'd rather watch space hokum like either 'Space Camp' or 'Apollo 18' because one made a great 'what-if' fable and the other was a horror chiller about why we haven't returned to the Moon. Finally, the best thing about 'Gravity' is that it clocks in at 90 minutes. It remains to be seen how NASA will respond if 'Gravity' makes believers out of all of us that space is the last place we should spend our tax dollars. I'd rather watch 'Apollo 18' again with its cannibal moon rocks than the prosaic 'Gravity.'",7,5,11,12 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Honor Under Fire
","Mark Wahlberg struggles to stay alive in war-torn Afghanistan throughout 'Friday Night Lights' director Peter Berg's 'Lone Survivor,' a heroic but tragic combat chronicle co-starring Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Eric Bana. This gritty, profane, but ill-fated secret mission saga about former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell's battlefield exploits qualifies as an entertaining but predictable saga. Basically, this blood, sweat, and tears, mission-gone-awry movie reminded me of Ridley Scott's grueling warfare spectacle 'Black Hawk Down.' Scott's actioneer dealt with a disastrous mission in Somalia, back in 1993, when U.S. Rangers were dispatched to snatch two warlords out of a town teeming with heavily armed fanatics. They encountered chaos galore and had to fight for their lives. Comparably smaller in scale, 'Lone Survivor' lacks the harrowing intensity of 'Black Hawk Down.' Our desperate 'Lone Survivor' hero endures a nightmare-experience that lesser souls would never have survived. Sadly, his three SEAL team unit members caught none of his breaks. Nevertheless, while watching 'Lone Survivor,' I didn't feel like I was dodging a firestorm of ordnance as I did when I sat through 'Black Hawk Down.' Despite its two-hour plus length, 'Lone Survivor' never bogs down. Although Berg's combat choreography lacks the visceral quality of 'Black Hawk Down,' the 'Lone Survivor' stunts look and sound very physical. Scenes of soldiers plummeting down the sides of craggy mountains made me flinch. Recently, I fell and shattered by right elbow so every time one of the SEALs struck either a rocky outcropping or a tree, I cringed at the sickening sounds. Specifically, Berg doesn't emphasize the predicament that ricocheting bullets posed. If you read the frank and outspoken Luttrell, whose memoir Berg adapted, the SEAL team member wrote about how ricochets could prove as menacing as the shots themselves. Most of the time, the SEALs find themselves trapped in terrain with scant foliage. Meaning, it was doubly difficult for them to hide not only from the flying lead but also ricochets. Unlike Luttrell, Berg doesn't dwell at length on the fatal mistake and its consequences as much as Luttrell's memoir. Instead, Berg winds up depicting the SEALs as honorable men who refused to take the easy way out of a moral quandary.'Lone Survivor' covers the three days during Operation Red Wing when an elite four-man unit of Navy SEALs set out to capture Taliban chieftain Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami of 'Crank') in the rugged Hindu Kush Mountains of the Kunar Province. They want Ahmad because he masterminded the murder of 20 American soldiers. Like the disastrous mission in 'Black Hawk Down,' the 'Lone Survivor' heroes are conducting business-as-usual until everything that can go wrong goes horrendously wrong. Similarly, like 'Black Hawk Down,' 'Lone Survivor' derives its narrative from a factual, eyewitness account. During the opening credits, Berg gives us a glimpse at wannabe Navy SEALs negotiating a gauntlet of an obstacle course. Grainy, documentary-style footage of SEALs enduring the worst that you can imagine outside of combat foreshadows the tenacity of our heroes. They can take a licking and keep on ticking. Afterward, we meet the quartet of warriors and enjoy their easy-going camaraderie. Twenty-nine-year old Texas native Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg of 'Ted') is a Hospital Corpsman who has no idea how complicated his life will be on his next mission. Luttrell's friends, Lt. Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch of 'John Carter'), Gunner's Mate Danny P. Dietz (Emile Hirsch of 'Savages'); and Sonar Technician Matthew 'Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster of '3:10 to Yuma'), are just as oblivious. Thoughts about home and their loved ones dominate their thoughts. No sooner have they reached their objective than an elderly goat herder and two boys accidentally stumble onto them in the brush. Our heroes capture these Taliban loyalists and take them prisoner. Lieutenant Murphy boils down their options. First, they can execute their hostages. Second, they can leave them tied to trees in the wilderness like snacks for wild animals. Third, they can release them and scrub the mission. Our heroes behave like noble western gunfighters. They decide to turn the shepherd and his sons loose. Luttrell and company believe they can clear out before the enemy show up. Unfortunately, our heroes find themselves suddenly surrounded by an army of Taliban terrorists armed with AK-47 assault rifles with an inexhaustible supply of ammunition. In his memoir, Luttrell compared their predicament to Custer's Last Stand. Afterward, a running gun battle follows with our heroes mowing down terrorists by the dozens. The problem is the Taliban have the SEALs hopelessly outnumbered and our heroes have nowhere to go. Worse, the SEALs have trouble getting a clear signal so they can contact headquarters and summon relief helicopter gunships!Characterization remains sketchy at best in 'Lone Survivor.' Indeed, we never gain much insight into the Americans as three dimensional characters. Berg treats the quartet of SEALs as if they were an ensemble so you're not sure initially who is going to buy the farm. No single character lords it over the others in spite of their respective ranks. Not surprisingly, the Americans emerge as sympathetic, but the filmmakers don't demonize the Taliban. Primarily, Berg keeps the villains at arm's length. The Taliban amounts to pugnacious, trigger-happy, dastards. Essentially, they resemble the hordes of Apache Indians in a cavalry western. We know little about them except that they are miserable marksmen, wear too much eye-liner, and live only to slaughter Americans with extreme prejudice. Surprisingly, Berg shuns any geopolitical messages or cultural bias. The sloppy but violent combat sequences will keep you distracted from diatribes from either side. 'Lone Survivor' is a good movie, but you won't want to see it more than once.",8,3,12,14 January 2014
The Big Lebowski," A Coen Bros. Classic!
","This masterpiece comedy from the Coen brothers with an unforgettable performance by Jeff Bridges as the Dude had an abysmal theatrical run, but it has generated a cult around it since it hit video. The Dude is the ultimate stoner, a slacker role model for the offbeat whose claim to fame is his superior skills as a bowler and the authorship of the Port Huron Statement. Whether Bridges likes it or not, he will always be a symbol of the rebellious counterculture. As his close friend Walter Sobchak, John Goodman is obnoxiously hilarious, whether he is whining about the buddies that he lost in Vietnam or his pseudo Jewish heritage, and John Turturro is just as outrageous as a weaselly sexual predator. The characters that make up 'The Big Lebowski' qualify as a diverse group. The Coen brothers deal with the theme of mistaken identities and a supposed kidnapping. Two of Jackie Treehorn's moronic thugs attack the Dude (Jeff Bridges) at his modest Venice Beach bungalow and plunge his head repeatedly into a toilet in an effort to wring information out of him. At one point, one of the two urinates on the Dude's thrown rug. Eventually, one thug figures out that the Dude is poor rather than wealthy. As it turns out, they targeted the wrong Lebowski but meant to confront Pasadena philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston of 'McQ') whose young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) owes Treehorn a bundle of dough. The Dude is so upset by the act of aggression by Treehorn's thugs that he visits Lebowski and demands compensation for his rug. Although Lebowski refuses to compensate the Dude, the Dude steals a rug and falls under the scrutiny of Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore of 'The Forgotten')who was sentimentally attached to the rug. She explains that she controls all of the money and doles out amounts to Jeffrey. Anyway, Jeffrey hires the Dude to serve as a go-between the kidnappers and Lebowski. Walter tries to tell the Dude how to handle this sticky situation, but everything that Walter does leads to something infinitely worse. At mid-point, Walter is seen running around his ex-wife's Pomeranian. Some of the funniest scenes involve idiotic Walter taking a tire-iron to a sports car that he thinks a little boy owns and another has a trio of German nihilists visiting the Dude's apartment and dumping a marmot in his bathtub while he is bathing.'The Big Lebowski' winds up being an oddball Raymond Chandler-esque mystery with the Dude acting as a gumshoe. As usual, the Coens present a gallery of weirdo characters. Maude ranks as a really warped character who describes her experimental art as 'vaginal.'Sam Elliott is very good as the narrator known only as 'The Stranger' who introduces us to the Dude during an evocative opening title sequence with the Sons of the Pioneers crooning in the background.",10,1,6,12 May 2011
Unbreakable," No 'Sixth Sense'
","Writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film 'Unbreakable' refers to its protagonist, football stadium security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who has been born with an almost perfect body because his bones cannot be broken. Far less introspective and surprising than the enigmatic 'Sixth Sense,' this atmospheric melodrama depicts the friendship between Dunn and an African-American, Elijah Price, nicknamed Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from an unusual bone disease designated 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta.' Basically, 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta' is a genetic disorder where bones break easily. In other words, Glass' surname reflects the extremely fragile nature of his body. The first scene in 'Unbreakable' details the birth of Mr. Glass in a department store apparel fitting room. One of the men who takes charge of the infant discovers to his horror that the little boy's arms and legs are misshapen from where he fought to get out of his mother's womb. Later, we learn that Mr. Glass has become obsessed with comic book superheroes. Shrewdly, his mother (Charlayne Woodard of 'The Crucible') used comics to coax her son out of the seclusion of their apartment. Glass becomes a leading authority on comic books as well as the characteristics of super heroes and super villains. He represents a strong villain because he reckons if he occupies one end of the spectrum then an 'unbreakable' hero occupies the other end. In his fiendish efforts to find the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Glass commits incorrigible crimes which eventually land him in a mental asylum. For example, he engineers a train wreck where everybody on board dies, except for our protagonist David Dunn.Eventually, Mr. Glass catches up with David after his miraculous survival without a broken bone makes news' headlines as the sole survivor of the deadly train wreck. Moreover, he takes a bizarre interest in him that Dunn doesn't reciprocate. Nevertheless, David's curiosity prompts him to search for information about his health that he has taken for granted. For example, he has never missed a day at work owing to illness. Later, he realizes that he was never injured in an accident that broke his future wife's leg. After the wreck, David cites an injury that convinced him from pursuing a promising career in college football. His wife, Audrey Dunn (Robin Wright of 'Forrest Gump'), is relieved to learn David has decided to hang up his cleats. Glass' inquiries arouses the curiosity of David's son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark of 'Gladiator') who loads up more free weights than David thinks possible to press and winds up impressing both of them. David pushes 350 pounds! Later, when Joseph is convinced that his father cannot be hurt by flying lead, a standoff occurs in the kitchen with Joseph threatening his dad with a revolver at point blank range. Of course, neither David nor his terrified wife Audrey believe that he is invincible where bullets are concerned, and they manage to persuade Joseph to put the pistol down. Reportedly, when George Reeves portrayed the Man of Steel on the television program 'Superman,' a child approached him with a gun during a public appearance and tried to shoot him, but Reeves talked him out of it. He warned him that the bullet might ricochet off him and wound somebody else.The $75-million 'Unbreakable' boils down to your basic clash of the titans. Mr. Glass has spent his entire life searching for David. Initially, David refuses to believe anything about him made him special. After the tragic train accident, David has second thoughts. One scene demonstrates both of David's two usual capabilities. A maniac forces his way into a residential home, kills the husband, ties up the two children, assaults the wife, and leaves her tied up with bleeding wrists. Meantime, David has the power of insight that enables him to tell who constitutes a threat to the public. Glass is on hand at the football stadium when David displays this power. Scrutinizing the spectators filing into the stadium, David points out a suspicious character wearing a cameo shirt. Our protagonist suspects this fellow may be packing a pistol out-of-sight under his shirt. At the last minute, the suspicious fellow steps out of line. Desperately Mr. Glass pursues him and falls down a stairway in his efforts to learn if he was toting a firearm which matched David's description. Indeed, this suspicious guy was carrying a concealed weapon! Later, David spots a maintenance man. They brush past each other, and David follows him to the house where the husband lies dead and the children are tied up. David attacks the maintenance man and gets his arms around his neck. The maniac slams David repeatedly against walls, smashing up those walls, but he cannot dislodge David who keeps him in a choke hold until the brute loses consciousness. At first, David and his family didn't trust Elijah, and they classified him as a nuisance. Their attitude changes, and the two become friends, until the final quarter of the action, when Elijah reveals his true colors, and David realizes that Elijah poses a threat. He orchestrated three terrorist attacks in an effort to find the man at the other in of the spectrum. Once, David recognizes Glass as a threat, he alerts the authorities.Clocking in at 106 minutes, 'Unbreakable' seems to take forever to unfold. The ending is a let-down because Glass and David never tangle, but the character-driven action is momentarily engrossing until it concludes with an anti-climactic situation. Bruce Willis delivers a beautifully restrained performance, and he behaves just as we suspect a normal person would. The scene on the train before the accident is liable to draw the wrath of married women. David removes his wedding ring and makes a play for a female passenger who sits beside him. Samuel L. Jackson is just as good as Elijah but never really seems menacing enough. Despite the strong character study of two rivals, 'Unbreakable' is by its dreary pace and its anti-climactic ending.",6,0,1,2 February 2017
Star Trek," Re-launching 'Star Trek'
","After the debacle of 'Mission: Impossible III,' J.J. Abrams has redeemed himself as a filmmaker with the new reboot of the 'Star Trek' franchise. Yes, I was prepared to hate this prequel, but it is a solid piece of entertainment with a look-alike cast, terrific special effects, warp speed momentum, and fantastic villain in Eric Bana. Happily, Leonard Nimoy's role is more than just a cameo. Most older 'Trek' fans of my age will enjoy this sci-fi adventure opus and the maiden voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise is memorable as well as the back stories on the regular 'Star Trek' characters. The film works not only as a prequel but also as a tribute to the venerable series.Abrams and his scenarists open this epic with a bang-up sci-fi battle that coincides with the birth of Jim Kirk as his father George evacuates them off the doomed Starship U.S.S. Kelvin. They provide glimpses of the lives of Spock growing up on Vulcan and suffering the torment of Vulcan who treat him with nothing less than contempt. Meanwhile, James T. Kirk grows up to become a renegade, a daredevil. As an unruly kid, he steals his step-fathers vintage Corvette and drives it off a cliff when a motorcycle cop tries to pull him over. Clinging the edge of a cliff and trying to hoist himself up to safety becomes a way of life for Kirk. The next time we see him he tries to get fresh with a bar room of Star Fleet Academy types and they stomp him butt into the ground. Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood of 'Thirteen Days') intervenes and tries to persuade Kirk to join Star Fleet Academy because he has the grades and he could get a command in three years.Spock grows up and refuses an opportunity to serve Vulcan. Instead, he opts to become an officer in the Federation, something that seriously upsets the Vulcans who have tried to overlook his half-breed quality. Spock's father (Ben Cross) married an Earth woman while he was ambassador to Earth and Spock was a product of that union. The alternate reality plot is something else. Nero plans to destroy Earth as well as other Federation planets because his planet where his wife lived was destroyed. It's a really complicated plot. Nero commands a gigantic ship that resembles briars. There is a lot of action, suspense, and humor.",10,1,13,18 June 2009
Fury," Tanks for the Memories!!!
","War is undeniably hell in writer & director David Ayer's 'Fury,' a grim but electrifying World War II saga about tanks. Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, and Jon Bernthal are thoroughly repellent as the battle-scarred crew of a U.S. Army Sherman M4A3E8 tank that tangles with a monstrous German 131 Tiger tank. For the record, the 33-ton Sherman tank came armed with a 75mm gun, but this was no match for the ferocious 54-ton Tiger tank. German Tigers boasted not only an 88mm gun, but also bore 3.9 inches of armor. Incredibly, Sherman tank shells often bounced off Tigers. Nevertheless, Tigers couldn't match a Sherman's rate of fire. Moreover, Tigers were vulnerable to shots fired at their rear compartments, and they consumed far more fuel than the Shermans. Unlike the Sherman tanks that their colleagues cruise around in, Pitt commands a modified Firefly Sherman tank equipped with a more powerful, 17-pound, super-velocity, anti-tank gun. The rugged combat sequence between three Shermans and a lone Tiger marks the high point of this blistering blood, guts, and testosterone-laced actioneer. 'Fury' takes place in 1945, after the Allies have crossed the Rhine River into Hitler's Fatherland. Although our heroes belong to the U.S. 2nd Armored division, Ayer provides few details about where the action is actually happening. This may frustrate some armchair World War II scholars who thrive on such minute details. Indeed, nobody drops the names of prominent generals on either side or mentions historic battles. All we know is that our heroes started killing Germans in North Africa, and they have been pursuing them across Northern Europe with a terrible vengeance. Essentially, 'Fury' is a World War II variation on the mud and blood splattered, World War I classic 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930) but told from the perspective of the newest member of a Sherman tank's crew. Typically, most World War II movies pass off Korean War era tanks for Shermans and Tigers, but all the 'Fury' tanks are authentic. The producers borrowed the last remaining Tiger tank from the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset, England. 'Fury' opens with hard-bitten Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt of 'Killing Them Softly') leaping like a savage Apache warrior onto an unsuspecting Nazi SS Officer on a white horse riding through a battlefield and stabbing him to death. Collier's Mexican-American tank driver, Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Peña of 'End of Watch'), cranks up their Sherman tank nicknamed 'Fury,' and they trundle off to a nearby Allied supply camp. Collier isn't happy because one of the original members of his five-man crew died in combat. As it turns out, Collier lands the worst of all possible replacements, Private Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman of 'The Three Musketeers'), a green, wet-behind-the-ears, teenager with neither the appropriate training nor combat experience. Cherub-faced Norman is a clerk typist who can bang out 60 words-a-minute. He knows nothing about tanks and he has never shot anybody. Collier and his unsavory crew terrify and toughen-up poor Norman so he can handle the pressures of combat. Collier forces Norman to shoot an unarmed S.S. soldier in the back. Collier, it seems, hates the S.S. with a virulent passion. The SS constituted the most brutal component of the Third Reich. Murdering civilians and unarmed prisoners-of-war constituted their stock-in-trade. Anyway, a young, inexperienced lieutenant orders Collier and two Sherman tanks to follow him into combat. The officer doesn't last long. An S.S. trooper with an anti-tank missile turns the lieutenant's tank in an inferno, and the lieutenant shoots himself before the flames roast him. Collier receives new orders from Captain Waggoner (Jason Isaacs of 'Windtalkers') to rescue G.I.s who have been cut off from their unit. No sooner have the Shermans embarked on their mission than Collier spots a Tiger. Our heroes find themselves in a life and death struggle to dodge the Tiger's screaming shells. Gradually, young Norman becomes as psychotic about killing the enemy as his companions. The real trial by combat occurs when the Fury strikes a German land mine and breaks down at a crossroads. Collier refuses to abandon the Fury, even after Norman spots about 300 SS troops marching their way, proudly warbling a Nazi song.Naturally, comparisons between Brad Pitt's Sergeant Collier in 'Fury' and his Lieutenant Aldo Raine in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' are inevitable. Personally, I deplored 'Inglourious Basterds,' while at the same time I admired Tarantino's tongue-in-cheek spin on World War II heroics. Like his ridiculously redneck officer in Tarantino's tale, Pitt lives to exterminate Nazis. However, Pitt doesn't try to be funny in 'Fury,' and he is more convincing, especially during his dour moments when he coerces Norman, the epitome of innocence, to have sex with a German civilian. Unfortunately, writer & director David Ayer doesn't sketch in a backstory to explain Collier's hatred of the enemy. Meantime, Collier's crew looks straight out of a World War II propaganda movie. Hollywood combat movies made during the 1940s emphasized America's melting pot demographics. Collier's driver is an Hispanic-American, while his shell loader, obnoxious Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal of 'The Walking Dead'), is a raging Cajun. The gunner of the bunch, Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf of 'Transformers') is a scripture-spouting, religious fanatic. All of them harass, humiliate and humble Norman until he becomes as cruel as they are. Nevertheless, Ayers spares us of usual banter about the girls back home, mom's apple pies, and favorite baseball teams. The final set-piece at the crossroads looks like a World War II version of the Alamo with our heroes battling the Nazi horde as if they were Audie Murphy. These Nazi warriors are essentially anonymous villains who lack the intelligence to wield their anti-tank missiles with the same accuracy that they did earlier in the film. Despite its lethargic 135 minutes and its bleak but predictable script, 'Fury' remains tenaciously gripping, perhaps even more so during its quiet moments than its explosive ones.",8,4,9,26 October 2014
Fight Club," 'Fight Club' is the main event of the millennium!
","'Fight Club' is a knock-out! Brad Pitt and Edward Norton star and spar in this bizarre but insightful bare-knuckled, no-holds-barred pugilistic parable. 'Fight Club' takes some mighty savage but satirical swings at consumerism, anarchy, and male impotence. 'Se7en' & Alien 3' director David Fincher delivers another of his kinetically super-charged, darkly lensed, adrenaline-laced epics about guys gelded by a gilded society who come to life when they stain their fists with blood. Penned by 'Jumper' scenarist Jim Uhls from Chuck Palahniuk's first novel, 'Fight Club' appears to glorify violence, promote fascism, and degrade women. Instead, 'Fight Club' denigrates the first, shows contempt for the second, and give Helen Bonham Carter her juiciest role in years.'Fight Club' spins a yarn every bit as audacious, manipulative and exhilarating as Fincher's earlier opus 'The Game.' Edward Norton of 'Rounders' serves as our narrator for this 140-minute marathon that goes the distance. Caged in a dead end job, Norton files reams of car accident statistics for a major automaker. Essentially, he must calculate when the best interests of the company are served by paying off car crash survivors rather than demanding a recall. Anyway, he flies everywhere to inspect these wrecks and begins to suffer from more than occupational jet lag.Inevitably, our anonymous narrator turns into a depressed white-collar insomniac. Lack of sleep drives him to the hospital. Incredibly, his doctor refuses to give him any drugs. He suggests instead that our narrator attend a support group for survivors of testicular cancer so that he can appreciate what constitutes real pain. Surprisingly, Norton discovers that he can purge himself emotionally without fear of humiliation. Afterward, his burden sloughed off, he goes home to his luxuriously appointed condo, hits the sack and sleeps like a baby. Franz Kafka couldn't have captured the malaise of modern society as crisply as Jim Uhls has in 'Fight Club.' Soon our unnamed narrator begins to gleefully orchestrate his life around these 12-step meetings and support groups for habits and diseases that he doesn't have. He is hooked and happy about until Marla Singer (Helen Bonham Carter of 'Hamlet') spoils these gatherings. He knows that she is a fraud and fears she will expose him. They snarl at each other but call a truce and form an uneasy alliance. They will alternate nights at different groups so they won't collide with each other.Marla poses few problems compared with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a mysterious maverick of a man encountered by our hero during a bumpy plane ride. Durden epitomizes cool; he has everything our narrator lacks. Self-assured, scruffily clad, with all the hypnotic charm of a snake, Durden lurks around the narrator. Tyler attracts followers like a magnet. After an unknown arsonist destroys our narrator's condo, he hooks up with Tyler. They create 'Fight Club,' a form of underground tough man boxing.Remember 'Every Which Way But Loose,' with Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson in 'Hard Times?' They fight in dark, dank basements. Fincher pulls no punches when the combatants start swinging at each other. Quite simply, these fights are brutal, especially when a pretty boy (Jared Leto of 'Urban Legend') is battered to a pulp until he resembles the elephant kid. Only the knuckle-headed will exit 'Fight Club' looking for an excuse to scrap. The friendship between Tyler and our hero takes some wildly out-of-control turns. Tyler takes 'Fight Club' to other cities, and then movies to the next level with 'Project Mayhem,' a demolitionist's fantasy that involves destroying credit card corporations. Our hero balks at Tyler's outlandish aims and the mindless, skin-headed idiots that he recruits for his cause. But it isn't until the third act, so to speak, when 'Fight Club' decks you with a shocking revelation: Tyler Durden may not be who we think he is.'Fight Club' will send some audiences reeling in disgust at its sicko shenaniganslike when Durden urinates in the soap at an expensive restaurant where he waits tables. Don't ask what he puts in the clam chowder. When Tyler works as a projectionist at a movie theatre, he splices frames of male genitalia into family movies! If you cannot handle a film poling fun at you, you probably won't appreciate some of the subversive humor. Twentieth Century Fox appears to have gone out of its way to sanitize 'Fight Club,' but Fincher is such a good director that his visuals contain more bite than his narrative. Like in 'The Game,' where Michael Douglas' snotty rich guy had to run a grueling gauntleta present of sorts for the man who has everything'Fight Club' lowers the boom on hypocrisy. The Uhls script brims with several snappy and quotable one-liners.'Fight Club' will strike some people as pretty strange, too. Any movie that never reveals its hero's name, especially when he provides the narration, is probably too pretentious for its own good. 'Fight Club' emerges as an abrasive movie, and Fincher digs his satirical claws in deep. We live in a media jungle, and 'Fight Club' smirks at the notion that we would want to destroy it to return to lives of quiet destitution. With 'Fight Club,' Fincher matches anything that Stanley Kubrick helmed in his prime and shows Terry Gilliam a trick or two.'Fight Club' is the main event of the millennium.",10,1,4,17 September 2008
As Good as It Gets," As Good As Jack and Helen Can Get!
","'As Good As It Gets' ranks as the best Jack Nicholson movie in ages, and it is a pretty nutty comedy, too. Considering the crap that Nicholson has appeared in lately, 'As Good As It Gets' is easily the most memorable film that he has starred in since the 1980s. Talk about stinkers and sinkers, specifically 'Blood & Wine,' 'Mars Attacks,' 'The Crossing Guard,' 'Wolf,' and 'Hoffa,' were as disposable as they were objectionable. Top heavy with multi-dimensional characters, 'As Good As It Gets' generates its crisp plot from the recurring collisions that occur between flaky characters. Uneven, often predictable, but consistently entertaining at 138 minutes in length, 'As Good As It Gets' unspools like a long, leisurely situation comedy. 'Terms of Endearment' writer & director James L. Brooks spices up this superlative comedy with several politically incorrect one-liners and charms some scintillating performances from both Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear. The cutest performance belongs to a scene-stealing pooch, an adorable Brussels Griffon doggie that resembles a 'Star Wars' Ewok.Mark Andrus co-wrote 'As Good As It Gets' with Brooks. The plot details the back and forth relationships between two Manhattan apartment dwellers, novelist Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson of 'Batman') and gay painter Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear of 'Sabrina') and woebegone waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunts of 'What Women Want'), a single-parent mom who befriends Bishop but spars constantly with Udall. Brooks and Andrus take their time laying out and setting up the action about two guys, a girl and a dog. At times, 'As Good As It Gets' seems indulgently slow, but the characters and their dialogue are rewarding and the ending is definitely worth the waiting. While Brooks and Andrus are developing their storyline, they criticize HMOs, debunk homosexuality, and invigorate a moth-eaten May/December romance with a gutsy vitality that most mainstream Hollywood movies shun.Nicholson shines as middle-aged romantic novelist Melvin Udall. He is somebody Archie Bunker might initially like if Melvin got chummy enough with him. But Melvin doesn't appear to like anybody. His quirky behavior qualifies him as obsessive-compulsive. He lives a strict, regimented life. He scrubs his hands with a fresh bar of soap every time, brings his own plastic utensils when dining out in restaurants and hates to step on a crack or a line in the pavement. Clearly, Melvin is a classic Nicholson character. He is as insidious and snide as Randle P. McMurphy was in the 1975 Oscar winning film 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' and Billy Budduskey in Hal Ashby's 'The Last Detail' (1973).Nevertheless, far from being a stereotype, Melvin is allowed to evolve and change as a character as he interacts with Connelly and Bishop. Trouble enters paradise in the Andrus and Brooks' script when Vincent (Skeet Ulrich of 'Scream'), a gay street hustler posing for Bishop, sets him up for a robbery. Not only is Bishop robbed, but the thugs also nearly cripple him. It is not often that Hollywood shows queers battling queers. When Bishop's lover Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr. of 'Boat Trip') puts him in the hospital, Frank convinces Melvin with threats to take care of Bishop's fuzzy little dog Verdell. Surprisingly, Melvin and the Verdell develop a friendship. When Melvin isn't letting the mutt get the best of him, he romances Connelly and helps her with her son Spencer who is bed-ridden.Indeed, 'As Good As It Gets' gets rather sappy. You know you're not watching a typical Hollywood opus when an older man gets the younger woman without getting her in the sack. Bishop, the gay character here, redefines traditional homosexual behavior. 'As Good As It Gets' is ideal fare for moviegoers who prefer unusual but sentimental flicks with solid performances, especially from Nicholson, Kinnear and Hunt, sizzling dialogue, and against-the-grain messages.",10,2,4,25 December 2009
The Rookie," The Best Pitcher of the Year!!!
","Once upon a time Hollywood produced live-action, G-rated movies without foul language, immorality, and gore-splattered violence. These movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions. The heroes differed little from the crowd. They shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens. Since the 1970s, the film industry has pretty much written off G-rated movies for adults. Basically, modern mature audiences demand large doses of embellished realism for their cinematic diet, laced heavily with vile profanity, mattress-thumping sex, and knuckle-bruising fisticuffs. These ingredients constitute the difference between G-rated movies and those rated either PG or PG-13.Miraculously, director John Lee Hancock, who penned scripts for Clint Eastwood's 'A Perfect World' (1993) and 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' (1997), hits a home run with this G-rated, feel-good, four-bagger of a baseball epic that not only celebrates America's favorite summer time sport, but also extols the competitive spirit of the game. Essentially, 'The Rookie' resembles the 1984 Robert Redford saga 'The Natural' about an old-time slugger who makes a comeback. Unlike 'The Natural,' 'The Rookie' shuns swearing, sex, and violence.Moreover, rugged Dennis Quaid plays a real-life individual. Jim Morris' autobiography, 'The Oldest Rookie: Big-League Dreams from a Small-Town Guy,' served as the basis for Mike 'Finding Forrester') Rich's unpretentious, Norman Rockwell-style screenplay about white, middle-class aspirations. Morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999. Although it doesn't belong in the same league with the inspirational James Stewart classic 'The Stratton Story' (1949), 'The Rookie' qualifies as the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore because audiences find them antiquated.Hancock and Rich encapsulate their entertaining oddball biography in a halo of mysticism. A wildcat oil prospector convinces two Catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a West Texas well. Fearing they have blown their bucks on an ill-advised fantasy, the sisters blanket the arid terrain with rose petals and entreat St. Rita's patron saint of hopeless causes' to intervene. The well gushes! The Town of Big Lake emerges, and roughnecks swat at baseballs when they aren't drilling holes in the terrain. The spirit of baseball oozes from the earth like petroleum. Meanwhile, years later, the U.S. Navy doesn't keep Jim Morris, Sr., (Brian Cos of 'Manhunter') and his family in one place long before uprooting them. The constant moving takes a toll on Jim Junior. Jim's dad shows little sympathy and berates baseball.Nevertheless, Jim has baseball in his blood, enough so that when he accepts a high school chemistry teacher's job in his Texas hometown, he organizes a baseball team. Like the foul-mouthed 'Bad News Bears,' 'The Rookie' chronicles Jim's triumph at turning losers into winners. Morris promises the team if they reach the divisional playoffs, he will try out for a professional baseball team. Predictably, Morris' students maintain their end of the bargain. At age 35, Jim stuns the big league scouts when he hurls fastballs at 98 miles-per-hour! 'The Rookie' never fouls out.",10,2,2,29 May 2008
The Maze Runner," Pretty Amazing!!!
","Usually, Hollywood does little justice to novels. Undoubtedly, this has something to do the sense of unity the author or authors impose on their work, despite any tampering on the part of the publisher. By the time the novel illuminates the screen, a horde of individuals—including but not limited to the producers, directors, writers, and the studio bosses—has gone through it in an effort to make it more palatable for movie-going patrons. Sometimes, they change the book so you don't recognize it or audaciously leave it intact. In the latter instance, the author may have adapted his own work for the screen. Indeed, this seems to be the case with David Fincher's 'Gone Girl.' Typically, Hollywood doesn't let the author interfere until that piece of literary genius has coined multi-millions at the box office and the sequels and prequels are in the works. Meantime, one of the biggest problems with adapting a novel is the drastic difference between books and movies. Some things that appear promising in print simply don't translate to the screen. Occasionally, the novel may be too massive for the screen like J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was until the advent of computer-generated imagery. Surprisingly enough, 'The Maze Runner' ranks as the exception to the rule; it surpasses its literary counterpart. Anybody who is a stickler for faithful adaptations will grit their teeth at the liberties freshman director Wes Ball and scenarists Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers, and T.S. Nowlin have taken with James Dashner's post-apocalyptic, young-adult, science fiction bestseller. Apart from 'The Maze Runner,' Oppenheim has written only one other screenplay and it is for the upcoming 'Divergent' sequel 'Allegiant: Part 1,' while Myers has written nothing else. Not only has Nowlin been revising the forthcoming 'Fantastic Four' reboot, but also he has been hired to script 'The Maze Runner' sequel 'The Scorch Trials.' Mind you, some of the events depicted in Dashner's provocative novel wouldn't have appeared as realistic on screen, principally; Ball and company have altered the Griever's hole, eliminated the cliff, and changed the Glade layout. I think they have done a splendid job of sprucing up 'The Maze Runner' without sabotaging it.When we meet him for the first time, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien of 'The Internship') is a 16-year old who doesn't remember his name. He awakens to find himself ascending in a supply elevator 'The Box' to place called 'the Glade.' After the elevator jars to a halt, several teens pull him out. Gally (Will Poulter of 'We're the Millers'), Alby (Aml Ameen of 'Red Tails'), and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster of 'The Baytown Outlaws') are among those teens. Afflicted with amnesia, Thomas knows nothing about his new surroundings. Initially, Gally proves to be the most inhospitable member of the Glade. He hates Thomas from the moment he sees him. Thomas reciprocates this sentiment and tries to escape. This little stunt earns our protagonist a night in the slammer. When he emerges the following day, Thomas learns escape is impossible. He stares in awe at the towering stone skyscrapers that enclose 'the Glade' where the teens thrive on supplies brought in by the Box. Those gargantuan walls that tower all around the Glade constitute the perimeter of 'the Maze.' While the sun shines, the Maze doors remain open. At dusk, these colossal doors rumble back together as if by remote control and slam shut.Thomas discovers some of the Gladers have been imprisoned there for three years. Everybody, our hero learns, performs a specific task. Some tend the gardens; others prepare meals; still others build the enclosures, and some even serve as medics. The job Thomas desperately relishes is to be a runner. Runners enter the maze at dawn and explore the exotic premises until dusk. They scour this enormous labyrinth in search of an exit. Unfortunately, nobody has yet found one. None of the runners prowl around after dark in the maze because grisly creatures known as the Grievers lurk in the shadows. These giant, slimy, bug-like predators scamper about on mechanical legs. Moreover, they can scale walls when they aren't charging down corridors. Equipped with stingers, they dispense venom that can transform a teenager into a screaming maniac. Miraculously, Thomas lures one of these hideous devils into a corridor as the walls shift and crush it to bits. This is the first time a Griever has ever died in the maze. Horrified, Gally wants to banish Thomas. Things get worse when the Box delivers a girl, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario of 'Moon'), and she brings a message that the end is near. Gally wants to kill Thomas and Teresa, but everybody else stands up for the two newbies.'The Maze Runner' takes its cues from a number of ancient myths, classic novels, and recent movies. First, because the teens tangle with the Grievers, this saga resembles the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Second, since guys dominate the Glade with a peculiar code of justice, 'The Maze Runner' is reminiscent of William Golding's post-apocalyptic novel 'Lord of the Flies,' published in 1954, about a group of students marooned on a desert island who struggle to survive. Inevitably, 'The Maze Runner' resembles the sci-fi saga 'Dark City.' In 'Dark City,' aliens control a replica of Earth as they try to come to terms with what it means to be human. Similarly, these aliens alter the landscape of their bogus city, much in the same way the maze changes during the night in 'The Maze Runner.' Naturally, Dashner's book bears some resemblance to other young adult novels such as 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent.' Director Wes Ball does an admirable job of generating baffling mystery and white-knuckled suspense throughout this tantalizing tale of terror. Nobody gives a bad performance, and Will Poulter makes a wicked villain. Sadly, the tension and suspense lapses after our heroes survive the maze and prepare for the sequel. Nevertheless, 'The Maze Runner' qualifies as pretty amazing.",9,0,3,6 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," A revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions!
","'Pulp Fiction' director Quentin Tarantino has taken Italian filmmaker Enzo G. Castellari's cult World War II thriller 'Inglorious Bastards' (1978) and reimagined it as a cinematic atrocity entitled 'Inglourious Basterds.' Castellari's riveting mission-behind-enemy-lines thriller about a group of court-martialed Allied deserters led by Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson qualified as an electrifying actioneer with charismatic characters boasting several surprises. Tarantino's tasteless tale not only lacks charismatic characters but it also contains no surprises. A bombastic piece of wartime crap containing Brad Pitt's worst performance, 'Inglourious Basterds'--with its deliberately misspelled title--is as appalling as Sasha Baron Cohen's homophobic hokum 'Bruno.' Hopelessly pretentious with its tactless Jewish revenge plot, this polished looking pabulum takes its own sweet time unfolding during a torturous two hours and thirty-three minutes. Garrulous dialogue scenes, erratic characters and a convoluted plot that all defy good taste, much less credibility,undermine what might have been an acceptable movie. Initially, the action—which Tarantino breaks into five chapters--opens during 1941 in the scenic French countryside. Unctuous Nazi 'Jew Hunter' Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at a farm house with several German soldiers and questions the owner, Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet of 'Hannibal Rising'), about Jews. Landa succeeds so well at ingratiating himself with LaPadite that the poor Frenchman breaks down and exposes the helpless Jewish family holed up down in his basement. The Nazis turn the basement into Swiss cheese with fusillades of machine gun fire. Miraculously, as only miracles in a movie can happen, one of the Jews, a young woman, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent of 'Snowboarder'), manages to escape. In the next scene, U.S. Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt of 'Ocean's Thirteen') assembles a team of Jewish Americans to infiltrate enemy lines and slaughter as many Nazis as possible. In fact, Raine demands that Sergeant Donny Donowitz ('Hostel' director Eli Roth), Private Smithson Utivich (B.J. Novak of TV's 'The Office'), Private Omar Ulmer (Omar Doom of 'Death Proof'), Private Gerold Hirschberg (Samm Levine of 'Club Dread'), Private Andy Kagan (Paul Rust of 'Semi-Pro'), and Private Michael Zimmerman (Michael Bacall of 'Undertow') take 100 Nazi scalps. So much for the time-honored Geneva Convention!In the next scene, Adolph Hitler (Martin Wuttke) clamors that their troops must stop talking about the 'Bear Jew.' The Fuehrer rants that the nickname German soldiers have saddled Sergeant Donowitz with is undermining Nazi morale. Indeed, Donowitz wields a baseball bat with ghoulish gusto. In one scene, he takes sadistic pleasure in smashing the skull of a Nazi soldier with a Louisville slugger. Moreover, Raine and his 'Holocaust' dogs display no qualms in scalping dead Nazis. When Tarantino isn't showing Americans carving the scalps off the fallen enemy, he has them slashing swastikas in the foreheads of live prisoners. Our psychopathic heroes have even gone so far as to rescue a renegade Nazi, Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger of 'Driven'), who has acquired a notorious reputation as a serial killer among his own ranks. Mind you, 'Inglourious Basterds' is too comically cretinous to distinguish between good Germans and bad Nazis. Like the politically incorrect cavalry westerns of yesteryear, the only good Germans in 'Inglourious Basterds' are a dead Germans.Three years have elapsed since Shosanna eluded Colonel Landa. She resides now in Paris and owns a cinema. A lonely Nazi soldier, Frederick Zoller (Christopher Reeve lookalike Daniel Brühl of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'), befriends her. Shosanna doesn't know Zoller is a war hero. Singlehandedly, he shot over 200 American G.I.s dead from his sniper's lair atop a bell tower. Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth of 'Stalingrad') has produced a movie about Zoller's exploits with Zoller playing himself. Moreover, Goebbels plans to premiere this epic in Paris for the high-ranking Nazi elite. Among those scheduled to attend are Hitler, Martin Bormann, Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, and famous German actor Emil Jannings. Of course, when Goebbels imposes on Shosanna to show the movie, she has no alternative. She does, however, have quite a barbecue cooked up for the cream of the Third Reich.Meantime, British Intelligence General Ed Fenech (Michael Meyers of the 'Austin Powers' movies) and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor of 'The Time Machine') have concocted their own secret mission. They plan to send British Lieutenant Arch Hicox (Daniel Day-Lewis lookalike Michael Fassbender of '300') behind enemy lines to masquerade as a Nazi. He will accompany one of their most trusted double-agents, German film starlet Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger of the 'National Treasure' movies), to the film premiere. Unfortunately, things go awry for Bridget and Hicox before they can rendezvous with Raine. They encounter a suspicious Gestapo officer in a basement tavern and a massacre ensues that nearly scuttles the mission.Evidently, the last thing Tarantino wanted to make was a patriotic World War II movie. Instead, he has tweaked history so that 'Inglourious Basterds' amounts to a revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions. Ridiculing the Nazis as supremely stupid swine is one thing, but it is quite another to depict Americans as murderous morons. Colonel Landa's outlandish incompetence at the premiere where he thwarts one plot but wholly overlooks another is hilariously awful. Brad Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine, a clownish Tennessee hillbilly with an ersatz Jethro Bodine drawl, is Tarantino's homage to late B-movie hunk Aldo Ray. Actually, Ray starred in the Italian WWII thriller 'Suicide Commandos.' Pitt plays the leader of this scummy little band of scalphunters without a shred of subtlety. Indeed, 'Inglourious Basterds' is about as subtle as a baseball bat to the brains. The only thing Tarantino forgot to do was dress his Jewish-American commandos up in grease paint, wigs, and phony accents like the Marx Brothers.",1,67,137,23 August 2009
Underworld," 'Underworld' is still a good horror thriller that you can sink your fangs into and enjoy for its vitality.
","Synthesize elements from famous film franchises like 'The Crow,' 'The Matrix,' and 'Blade' to forge a bullet-riddled, revisionist vampires-vs.-werewolves urban war epic, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect from the exciting, new, fantasy chiller 'Underworld' starring 'Pearl Harbor' beauty Kate Beckinsale. This supercharged but synthetic British horror thriller with R-rated heaps of blood & gore and a touch of Shakespeare plays fast and loose with vampire lore. Not only do the vamps refrain from shape shifting into bats, but also these pale-faced bloodsuckers can stare at their reflections in the mirror! Were that not enough these fangsters don't have to shack up for the day in their caskets. On the other hand, rookie director Len Wiseman and stuntman-turned-scenarist Danny McBride adhere to the lycanthrope legend with no radical departures. Action-packed from the outset, this darkly-lensed, tragic melodrama laid in a rain swept contemporary setting provides enough different things along the way with a couple of major plot revelations to boost 'Underworld' above its formulaic origins. For example, the vampires load their automatic weapons with silver nitrate slugs, while the werewolves pack cartridges filled with ultra-violet light to literally let daylight through their sworn enemies. The special effects sequences that depict the transformation from man into werewolf look cool, and the sight of these scary creatures hauling butt on the walls in pursuit of their prey make for memorable images. One especially clever scene shows a werewolf as he uses his bodily powers to pop the bullets out of his wounds.Although it runs a little over two hours, 'Underworld' maintains enough momentum in its melodramatic narrative and features strong enough villains that it entertains you without giving you nightmares. Surprisingly, though it looks like it should have descended from a graphic novel, 'Underworld' boasts no previous source material aside from an original story penned by black stuntman-turned-actor Kevin Grevioux, former 'Stargate' art director Wiseman, and McBride himself. When the bullets aren't thudding noisily in your ears, 'Underworld' features a deafening, industrial-strength, orchestral soundtrack written by ex-Tangerine Dreamer Paul Haslinger with songs written by David Bowie and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciate.Kate Beckinsale plays a leather-clad vampire warrior named Selene who cannot kill enough werewolves to satisfy her thirst for revenge. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a no-holds-barred war from centuries, and the vampires finally appear to have gotten the upper hand over the Lycans. According to Selene, these hideous Lycans wiped out her entire family and would have killed her too had it not been for vampire elder Viktor (Bill Nighy of 'Hitler's S.S.: Portrait in Evil') who saved her life and turned her into a vampire. Meanwhile, as Viktor rests in his tomb, his hand-picked protégé Craven (Shane Brolly of 'Impostor') appears to have turned traitor to his own kind. Secretly, Kraven has been negotiating a truce behind the scenes with the Lycans who are trying to develop a serum which will enable Lycans and vampires to mate. Naturally, when Selene awakens Viktor and reveals Kraven's insidious plot, all hell breaks loose. Furthermore, it doesn't help matters that the apparently whipped Lycans are far from whipped as Selene learns in an opening shoot-out in a subway tunnel. No, human society doesn't know about the millennium war happening right under their noses, because the vampires and werewolves conceal themselves so well. In fact, the vampires maintain their own blood bank, so they don't have to bleed humans dry. Once a rebellious Selene resurrects Viktor to punish the treacherous Kraven, the action really slams into high gear. Despite Kraven's assurances to the contrary that the werewolves have been eliminated as a threat, Selene sets out to convince Viktor that the werewolves are staging a comeback. Nothing can stop our hardnosed heroine from proving her point, even if she must turn against her own breed. Apparently, the Lycans have found a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman of 'Duets') who can assimilate both vampire and werewolf DNA so as to reproduce. Complications arise when Michael saves Selene's life, and she finds herself attracted to him. In 'Underworld,'Director Len Wiseman, who served as art director not only on the theatrical 'Stargate' but also 'Independence Day,' makes the most of his threadbare $20-million production so that 'Underworld' can compete with the films that inspired it. Set amid gloomy, Gothic castles where the elitist vampires huddle in their fight against evil, 'Underworld' stresses adrenaline-laced action with just enough time out for the exposition to keep audiences on track about who's who. While the characters aren't as substantial as they could be, each shows a different side as the plot approaches its climax. Selene changes from a mindless werewolf killer from the get-go when she learns the truth about her family and the heroic vampire who saved her from sure death. Tucked away in the flashbacks is another story that revolves around the villainous Viktor that explains his hatred of all things Lycan.Surprisingly, for a British-produced movie, 'Underworld' ignores sex, nudity, and romance in favor of bloodletting and mutilation. Although it cannot compare with 'The Crow,' 'The Matrix,' and 'Blade,' 'Underworld'manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production. The fact that the Brits were able to produce their own variation on these popular, special effects laden spectacles is reason enough to watch it. Unfortunately, like the vampires here who refuse to countenance interspecies breeding, nearly 90 per cent of American film critics have staked out this well-made thriller because they feel it offers nothing new and lacks the polished production values of those other film franchises. Truth is that getting a large scale action film like 'Underworld' made in England by Englishmen amounts to something like a miracle. While it doesn't look as polished as 'The Crow,' 'The Matrix,' and 'Blade,' 'Underworld' is still a good horror thriller that you can sink your teeth into and enjoy for its vitality.",8,1,2,29 July 2007
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Best 'Star Wars' Saga Since 'The Empire Strikes Back!'
","Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice, and the superlative science fiction saga 'Rogue One, A Star Wars Story' exemplifies this notion. Basically, 'Godzilla' director Gareth Edwards, 'Golden Compass' scenarist Chris Weitz, and 'Bourne' trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy have eliminated all those buffoonish, kid-friendly aliens primarily Jar-Jar Binks and given adults a chance to experience an unusually Spartan 'Star Wars' saga. No, the PG-13 rated 'Rogue One' is neither 'Saving Private Ryan' nor 'Hacksaw Ridge,' but the straightforward action will give you a reason to shed a tear since a palatable sense of doom looms over this skullduggery. Everything I've read about this entry in the 'Star Wars' universe emphasizes the word 'stand-alone' so you won't be seeing the gifted cast, featuring Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna, reprising their roles unless Disney conjures up prequels. Of course, this doesn't apply to Darth Vader who behaves like the ruthless ruffian that he has always been. Mind you, in some respects, 'Rogue One' may seem hopelessly predictable for some aficionados. If you've seen George Lucas' 'Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope,' then you know that the Death Star didn't survive that adventurous classic. 'Rogue One' qualifies as a prequel. Chronologically, this outing takes place between 'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' (2005) and 'Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope.' Although we know the Death Star is ill-fated, what we didn't know the identity of the individual who sowed the seeds for its destruction. Some of the finest moments in 'Rogue One' occur when the Grand Moff Tarkin appears. This is the infamous character that the late British actor Peter Cushing of 'Frankenstein' fame portrayed with such ascetic villainy. Cushing's estate approved the physical recreation of the late actor's personage, and actor Guy Henry's impersonation is flawless. Quibbles aside, if Peter Cushing could see what they've accomplished, he'd be impressed. Similarly, what Edwards and his scenarists have achieved with Disney's audacious attempt to expand the 'Star Wars' time-line is sensational. Indeed, the House of Mouse has succeeded where few film studios have ever gone with a legitimate spin-off from a multi-million-dollar franchise.Since 'Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope' came out back in the summer of 1977, fans have complained about the sweet spot in the Death Star that enabled the Alliance to blow it up. 'Rogue One' relates the story about that sweet spot, and 'Star Wars' aficionados can argue about other things—primarily the time-line between the two films—because Luke and Leia were born at the end of 'Episode III.' Nevertheless, who really cares about such things, when a movie like 'Rogue One' fills the gap? Aside from Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, and Princess Leia, the primary characters in 'Rogue One' are entirely new to the franchise. A brilliant scientist, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of 'Dr. Strange'), has been forced against his will to collaborate with the Empire to forge the ultimate weapon of devastation. The wicked Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn of 'Killing Them Softly') has commandeered Galen for the project, and he intends to use Galen's wife Kyra (Valene Kane of 'Victor Frankenstein') and his adolescent daughter Jyn (Beau Gadsdon) as bargaining chips. Galen sends his daughter into hiding, and Kyra perishes trying to thwart Orson. Jyn grows up under the tutelage of an extreme radical, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker of 'Platoon'), and she becomes a notorious criminal who has been imprisoned when the Rebel Alliance rescues her. It seems that an Empire pilot, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed of 'Nightcrawler') has defected and given himself up to Saw. Bodhi insists that he has an urgent message from Galen Erso about the Death Star. Naturally, nobody believes the Empire could have forged such an awesome weapon. The Rebel Alliance isn't prepared to be so casual about this booger bear. Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna of 'Blood Father') and his reprogrammed Empire Droid K-2so (voice of Alan Tudyk of 'Serenity') break Jyn (Felicity Jones of 'Brideshead Revisited') out captivity when she is being transferred to a labor camp. Later, as Jyn explains to Saw, the Rebel Alliance is using her for safe passage into Saw's camp on the planetary moon Jedha where Bodhi is being held captive. Saw surprises Jyn with a holographic message from Galen intended for her. Galen explains that the Death Star has the equivalent of an Achilles' Heel that will render it vulnerable to the Rebels. No sooner has Jyn seen this message than the Grand Moff Tarkin brings the Death Star into orbit around Jedha and unleashes its formidable power on the city. During their rushed exit from Jedha, Cassian and Jyn pick up a pair of hitchhikers, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen of 'Iron Monkey 2') and his sidekick Base Malbus (Wen Jiang of 'Let the Bullets Fly'), who become recruits for the cause. Chirrut is a blind martial arts warrior who wields a lethal staff and believes in the Force with all his heart.'Rogue One, A Star Wars Story' depicts the efforts of the underdog Rebel Alliance to triumph over the Empire. Basically, this exciting escapade works on the level of a Republic Serial from the 1940s with one cliffhanger scene after another ensuing in a grand finale on a scenic Caribbean-like island named Scarif where the star fleets of the both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire wage the battle to end all battles. Although it doesn't rely on the usual troika of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, 'Rogue One' imitates 'Star Wars' in virtually every respect except its ending with a Pyrrhic Victory. Felicity Jones makes a sympathetic heroine that you won't forget. Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO compete as the ultimate scene stealers. The special effects are stellar stuff. Altogether, 'Rogue One' qualifies as the best 'Star Wars' epic since 'The Empire Strikes Back.'",10,27,46,7 January 2017
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," The lack of romantic chemistry, a hopelessly muddled plot, and leaden direction sabotages 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin.'
","'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' confuses more often than entertains. Although I haven't read Louis de Bernieres's World War II-era bestseller, I know enough about the changes to recognize the shortcomings of director John Madden's leaden movie adaptation. Audiences may remember this English director best for his 1999 Oscar-winning comedy 'Shakespeare in Love.' Personally, I enjoyed Madden's earlier effort 'Mrs. Brown' (1997), starring Judi Dench as Queen Victoria. Nevertheless, if good looks guaranteed great cinema, 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' would qualify as spectacular. Lensed on location in scenic Greece by two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer John ('Braveheart') Toll, this ambitious but abominable Nicholas Cage & Penelope Cruz wartime tearjerker is easier on the eyes than the ears. Aside from establishing a concrete sense of setting and atmosphere, Madden and scenarist Shawn ('A World Apart') Slovo have butchered Bernieres's novel so that it emerges in bites and incomprehensible pieces. Incredibly, Madden and Slovo let the action veer erratically between comedy and tragedy with an indifferent romance at the heart handicapped by a curious lack of chemistry. Complaints about miscasting may arise in the minds of some moviegoers. Nicholas Cage's insufferably sweet, Puccini-loving, mandolin-strumming Italian artillery captain is almost enough to give Fascism a good name. Meanwhile, nothing good comes of Cage's ersatz Chico Marx accent. Actually, Sylvester Stallone would have been convincing in this role. If poor dialects irritate you, prepare for a veritable cacophony. English supporting actor John Hurt, Iberian beauty Penelope Cruz, and Welsh leading man/villain Christian Bale all sound and look out-of-place alongside Greek native Irene Papas. Purists will most likely skip this Zorba the Greek meets 'The English Patient,' not only for its inconsistent babble of accents but also for its mishmash of historical revisionism, not to mention its pallid plot.'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' unfolds on the idyllic Greek isle of Cephallonia in 1940. A wise old local physician, Dr. Iannis (John Hurt of 'Alien'), who has been compiling a history of the island and its earthquakes, narrates this yarn. He lives outside the village with his grown-up, headstrong daughter Pelagia (Penelope Cruz of 'Blow') in a small mountainside home. A brawny fisherman called Mandras (Christian Bale of 'Shaft') wins Pelagia's heart with his rough and tough ways. Her crusty old mustached father warns her from the start: 'I would expect you to marry a foreigner.' According to him, Greek men dominate their wives, and Mandras is 'not her equal.' When Mussolini invades Albania, Mandras and she get engaged. He ships out to fight the Italians. Pelagia pens dozens of letters, but Mandras never sends a reply. Later, we learn about Mandras's illiteracy. Perhaps Pelagia's father knows best. Anyway, this revelation smells like a plot contrivance. How could a bright, well-educated girl like Pelagia overlook such an obvious fact? She serves as her father's nurse and aspires to be a doctor herself. Doctors are trained to observe, so Pelagia should have known. Furthermore, neither Mandras nor Pelagia appear as if they were made for each other. One flirtatious splash in the Mediterranean doesn't a romance make. Madden doesn't pump up the passion between these two. Sadly, Bale and Cruz make an unpersuasive couple. Meanwhile, Madden has given audiences the village tour and introduced its citizenry. Dr. Iannis wields a fishhook to extract a dried pea from a man's ear canal. Although his hearing has been restored miraculously, the husband dreads a future where he must endure his wife's constant complaints. This joke serves as a bookend of sorts that opens and concludes the film. Suddenly, the skies erupt with military aircraft and parachutes blossom. Mussolini's Fascist troops have come to occupy Cephallonia and ships pour in more men and equipment.When Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicholas Cage of 'The Family Man') lays eyes on Pelagia, her beauty overwhelms him. 'Bella bambina!' He exclaims and orders his platoon to glance in her direction. Initially, true to the romance formula, Pelagia wants nothing to do with Corelli. She regards the Italians with fear and loathing. Corelli is not only an artillery captain but also serves as a translator. The scene in the town square when the Greeks refuse to surrender to the Italians, preferring instead the Nazis, deserves a lusty laugh. Later, the Italians decide to billet their officer elsewhere. The Italian Army quartermaster makes arrangements with Dr. Iannis to board Corelli. Pelagia hates these arrangements, until the captain captivates her with his mandolin.Gradually, Pelagia's glacial attitude melts, and she falls in love with Corelli, even after her betrothed returns to the island and joins the Greek partisans. Mandras's mother Drosoula (Irene Papas of TV's 'Homer's Odyssey') is not happy about this new arrangement. The Cage & Cruz romance kindles few sparks. A more meaningful but tragic romance occurs between a so-called good Nazi officer, Captain Gunter Weber (David Morrissey of 'Hilary and Jackie') and another island girl. Although Madden shows the Italians firing their artillery, this bunch of guys heads to the beach to guzzle wine and warble Verdi operas to their prostitutes. At first, everything seems great when our protagonists learn that Mussolini has surrendered and the war is over for them. 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' has focused primarily on comedy until the Nazis come goose stomping into the action, and everything turns tragic. Sadly, Madden botches both assignments. He cannot stage a decent big battlefield scene, and he fares no better with the intimate romance scenes. If you're looking for a better version of 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin,' then check out Gabriele Salvatores's 'Mediterraneo' (1991) which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. World War II buffs will appreciate the genuine-looking Stuka dive-bombers that rain destruction on Cephallonia. The lack of romantic chemistry, a hopelessly muddled plot, and leaden direction sabotages 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin,'and it fade outs on a whimper rather than a bang of jubilation.",1,6,10,8 February 2008
The Fan," Snipes and De Niro Strike Out in this Foul Ball Epic
","Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as 'Mean Streets,' 'Taxi Driver,' 'Goodfellas,' and 'Cape Fear.' In 'Top Gun' director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller 'The Fan,' De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of 'White Men Can't Jump'), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin).The plot of 'The Fan' alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of 'License to Kill') wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel 'The Fan' along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. 'The Fan' is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.",5,1,4,14 May 2012
Dawn of the Dead," Snyder's 100-minute remake equals the imaginative, but bloated 126-minute original and surpasses it in several respects
","Although Zack Snyder has produced only a handful of television commercials for Chevy Blazer, Budweiser, the NFL Quarterback Club, and BMW, this first-time helmer makes a stunning directorial debut with his super-charged, high-octane, blood-drenched remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' (***1/2 out of ****), zombie-master George Romero's low-budget, classic cannibal chiller sequel to his 1968 seminal undead black & white opus 'Night of the Living Dead.' Hard as it may be to imagine, Snyder's 100-minute remake equals the imaginative, but bloated 126-minute original and surpasses it in several respects. Naturally, Snyder benefits from conspicuous computer-generated special effects (not available to Romeo in 1978), a $28-million budget, and a fabulous cast featuring Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, Mekhi Phifer, and Jake Weber. The only blunder in scenarist James Gunn's screenplay is the irrational sentimentality one character attaches to a canine. Can anybody forget the scene in 'Alien' when Sigourney Weaver put herself in peril to rescue that darn cat? Well, pretty much the same thing occurs here smack in the middle of an adrenaline-laced action scene, and you want to shout back at the screen to stop such stupidity. Such is the visceral power of this entertaining but ghoulish 'Dawn of the Dead' remake. Compared with the shuffle-footed zombies of Romero's trilogy, Snyder's zombies rush their victims headlong like the defensive line of the Green Bay Packers on first and goal. Despite this unfortunate animal-lover's cliché, Snyder and Gunn have churned out one of the more riveting zombie movies in years. Forget those recent, reanimated efforts in the same direction by Paul Anderson's 'Resident Evil' and Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later.' Unlike its prestigious, path-breaking predecessor, who belongs to the independent, non-Hollywood film category, Snyder's mainstream Tinseltown remake fondly cherishes many of Romero's ideas when it isn't taking a different track. A group of unglamorous but heroic characters and Matthew F. Leonetti's grainy, stark widescreen photography give this macabre but mindless melodrama a hypnotic, hair-raising presence punctuated with bouts of satire.Whereas the original 'Dawn' opened with a S.W.A.T team blowing zombies away before the heroes flew away in a helicopter to the comparative safety of a Pennsylvania shopping mall, the hyperactive remake takes place in a Wisconsin mall. As the story unfolds, an overworked nurse, Ana (Sarah Polley of 'Go'), gets off work and heads home to her hubby for sex in the shower. During her hospital shift, she saw and heard about patients with mysterious bite wounds, but she missed all the special bulletins about a developing epidemic where these people die and come back to life as zombies. No, these aren't the traditional voodoo zombies from movies like 'White Zombie' (1932) or 'Plague of the Zombies' (1966). Instead, these undead dudes arise from an inexplicable virus or disease. In Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead,' newscasters speculated that a contaminated satellite probe back from space resurrected the dead. Nobody knows for sure in this 'Dawn' remake, and when Ana and her husband awaken the following morning to find her preteen daughter standing in their doorway with blood stains on her nightie, part of her face eaten away and a powerful urge to gnaw human flesh. She attacks her dad, tears a hole in his throat, and blood flies everywhere. A terrified Ana tries to stem the fountain of blood. Suddenly, her husband's eyes take on a dull glow and he goes after her. She escapes, jumps into her car, and careens off into the dawn. Chaos rules everywhere. Explosions erupt; smoke billows in clouds, and berserk gore-smeared corpses chomp away at anybody. Eventually, Ana hooks up with a police sergeant, Kenneth (Ving Rhames of 'Pulp Fiction), a husband, Andre (Mekhi Phifer of 'Honey'), his wife Luda (Inna Korobkina of 'The Ladies Man') and a salesman Michael (Jake Webber of 'Meet Joe Black') and they take refuge in the Crossroads Mall. Initially, they run afoul of three trigger-happy security guards: CJ (Michael Kelly of 'Unbreakable'), Terry (Kevin Zegers of 'Wrong Turn'), and Bart (Michael Barry of 'Detroit Rock City '). Predictably, these guys aren't happy to see them. They form an uneasy alliance and resolve their differences when thousands of zombies besiege them in the mall. No, a biker gang doesn't show up as in the original 'Dawn.' Instead, a truckload of other refugees shows up. Before the TV stations sign off, a preacher (Ken Foree of the original 'Dawn') utters the line made famous in Romero's 'Dawn': 'When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth.' Unlike the original,too, the remake gives our heroes another, more interesting way out of their predicament that recalls the climax in the Clint Eastwood epic 'The Gauntlet.'Shrewdly, Zack Snyder alternates scares with satire. Like the original, the heroes speculate that the zombies are flocking to the mall because it played a dominant role in their lives. Alas, this clever concept made the original 'Dawn' a witty satire on the foibles of humanity. Synder's 'Dawn' doesn't capitalize on it as much as Romeo's 'Dawn.' Instead, Snyder focuses on the alliance the occupants make before they break out and make a run for it. One scene that stands out involves the husband and wife. She gets bitten, but her husband hides her from the others. She turns into a hideous zombie and gives birth to a zombie baby. Mind you, if you like to dream sweet dreams, watching this 'Dawn' is going to be a nightmare for you. There's blood, gore, and more, but none of these zombies feast on body parts with the oozing alacrity that Romeo's zombies did. While Romeo generated suspense in his version, Snyder gives us wall-to-wall suspense that will have you gnawing your fingers to the quick. Make-up artist Tom Savini, who handled the blood and gore in the original 'Dawn,' has a cameo as a sheriff. Watching Zach Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' is like taking a bullet in the head.",9,0,2,22 June 2007
Iron Man 2," 'Iron Man 2' Lacks the Metal of 'Iron Man'
","'Iron Man 2' ranks as a CGI-riddled, overblown, second-rate sequel. Director Jon Favreau's original Marvel super hero saga delivered a slam-bang, refreshing blend of superheroism and bad attitude on the part of its egotistical protagonist, and Jeff Bridges proved a worthy rival as his treacherous vice president who copied his high-tech armored suit and challenged to the death. While Favreau's ambitious sequel delivers more than enough exhilarating displays of pyrotechnic prowess, 'Iron Man 2' is neither as nimble nor as engrossing as its spectacular predecessor. Indeed, Iron Man faces a new contender. Thuggish Ivan Vanko isn't as memorable as the sinister Obadiah Stane, but he does appropriate high moral ground as part of his crusade to topple our hero. Meantime, Robert Downey, Jr. is every bit as good as he was the first time around, and he tackles bigger problems in his encore in this follow-up adaptation of a popular comic-book series that came out in 1963. Unfortunately, 'Tropic Thunder' scenarist Justin Theroux wraps everything up a predictable plot that presents a plethora of complications but few surprises. Some movies suffer from too many characters and too great an agenda. This is what cripples 'Iron Man 2.' The middle section of this 124-minute marathon buckles under the weight of excessive plotting and extra characters before the film recovers sufficiently for a triumphant ending. The action unfolds in chilly Moscow as destitute Soviet physicist Anton Vanko (Yevgeni Lazarev of 'Lord of War') dies with his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke of 'Sin City'), at his side. While this is happening, the local news contains a broadcast of Tony Stark coming out of his metal closet to admit that he is Iron Man. Before the elder Vanko passes away, he assures his son that Ivan should have been in billionaire industrialist Tony Stark's shoes as Iron Man. As it turns out, Stark's late father Howard (John Slattery of 'Traffic') and Anton were partners who collaborated on the invention of the arc reactor. Eventually, Anton was deported to the Soviet Union where he managed to scrape out an miserable livelihood. Ivan finds the blueprints that his father created with Howard Stark. He sets about to construct a primitive version of Iron Man's breastplate and adds two crackling fiber-optic whips that can slice through metal as if it were butter. Look out Tony Stark! If Ivan doesn't represent a minor threat in the overall scheme of things, Tony discovers that the very suit that enables him to carry out his vigilante crime fighting exploits is contaminating his blood and gradually killing him. In other words, our hero has got to find a new energy source that won't kill him. Meantime, a United States Senate Investigation committee, headed up by slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling of 'What Planet Are You From?'), insists that Stark hand over the technology of his Iron Man outfit to the government for military application. Naturally, Stark doesn't cooperate. He explains that the suit and he are one and that America need not fear anybody cloning his flying suit of armor.Bored with the routine of running his massive corporation, Tony promotes his right hand woman, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow of 'Great Expectations'), as the CEO of Stark Industries. Of course, Pepper is flabbergasted by this extravagant gesture on Tony's part. Our hero flies off to Monaco to race in the Grand Prix and runs into Ivan with his whips. Pepper and Tony's chauffeur Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau of 'Couples Retreat') careen onto the race course and give our protagonist his suitcase version of his outfit. In no time at all, Iron Man emerges and defeats Ivan. Not long afterward, Tony's worst enemy--rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell of 'Moon') -- breaks Vanko broken out of prison and cuts a bargain with him to clone Tony's Iron Man outfit. Ivan, however, is no flunky and he embarks on an entirely different program. Instead of replicating Iron Man's outfit, he masterminds an army of drones that Hammer wants to sell to the Pentagon. Stark stages the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows, New York, to carry on his father's legacy. Anybody who creates a worthwhile contribution to technology can display their handiwork. Hammer unveils his drones, but learns too late that Ivan's infamous scheme supersedes his own plans. The chief problem with 'Iron Man 2' is its lackluster villain. As Ivan Vanko, Rourke appears appropriately nefarious as a walking, talking tattoo with a grudge against our champion, but he poses only a disposable threat. Mind you, he looks menacing enough, but his lack of charisma is only matched by his absence of hygiene. Now, Ivan's outfit looks more interesting, but Iron Man turns it against him in no time as he does the drones. Basically, Ivan combines Iron Man's adversary the Crimson Dynamo and the super villain Whiplash. Sam Rockwell's buffoonish second string villain qualifies as expendable. On the other hand, comedian Garry Shandling virtually steals every scene that he has as a Congressman, particularly the last scene when he decorates Tony Stark for saving the country from Ivan. Sexy actress Scarlett Johansson shows up as Natalie Rushman, a mysterious undercover female commando who can handle herself skillfully in combat with men. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Lieutenant Colonel 'Rhodey' Rhodes from Terence Howard. Rhodes takes one of Tony's Iron Man outfits because he doesn't want his friend to have a monopoly on world power. She replaces Pepper since Tony promoted Pepper upstairs. Favreau gives actor Samuel L. Jackson more screen time this time as Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but this character does little more than act as a press agent the eventual 'Avengers' team-up movie. Unfortunately, this installment generates neither enough excitement nor irony to overwhelm its own inertia. Anybody who walks out before the long end credits conclude their tedious roll will miss a brief scene where our hero's new antagonist leaves his calling card in a huge pit.",5,3,7,10 May 2010
World War Z," A Mainstream Zombie Saga
","The best thing about the zombie thriller 'World War Z' is its feverish pace. Only the zombies themselves move faster than this suspenseful, but immaculate, 115 minute chiller about a global zombie apocalypse. Cinematically, traditional zombies came from the Caribbean and shuffled. Indeed, zombies have been shuffling since 'White Zombie' (1930) where wicked sugar cane plantation owner Bela Lugosi exploited them as a source of cheap labor. Of course, he kept them under control with the use of voodoo. The zombies in 'WWZ,' on the other hand, run rather than shuffle. These aggressive, hell-bent-for-flesh zombies in 'World War Z' are nothing new, particularly since the Italian-produced outing 'Nightmare City' (1980) where the undead tried on their track shoes for the first time. Pouring out of a jetliner, those irradiated zombies wrecked havoc with weapons such as machetes, knives, axes, and machine guns! Most will remember '28 Days Later' (2003) as their introduction to fleet-footed zombies. Essentially, zombies were running long before 'World War Z.' Ostensibly based on Max Brooks' landmark zombie novel, 'World War Z' streamlines the story lines into one to generate greater momentum. Furthermore, this film concludes somewhat uncertainly with its catastrophe-in-progress, whereas the war in Brooks' book has ended. Brad Pit does play the equivalent of a United Nations agent, but he doesn't visit survivors and interview them. Fans of Brooks' bestseller may not appreciate the changes that 'Quantum of Solace' director Marc Forster and scenarists Matthew Michael Carnahan of 'The Kingdom,' Drew Goddard of 'Cloverfield,' and 'Lost' co-creator Damon Lindelof have wrought. Meantime, hardcore zombie fanatics will undoubtedly lament the lack of blood, gore, and more. This humorless Paramount release has eliminated virtually all traces of blood and gore for a family friendly PG-13 rating. You can catch more gut-munching on AMC's 'Walking Dead' than in this movie.Swedish director Marc Forster plunges audiences head first into the fracas. Initially, we meet the Lane family. Gerry (Brad Pit of 'Fight Club') is a former United Nations trouble shooter with a sterling reputation for getting the job done. He lives with his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos of 'Gangster Squad') and their two under-age daughters, Constance (Sterling-Jerins) and Rachel (Abigail Hargrove) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Life appears happy but not too sappy for the Lanes. No sooner have they wheeled into the streets than they witness some bizarre behavior. Helicopters swarm overhead as if an emergency has occurred, and police rush past them on their motorcycles. Our heroes listen to the radio and hear an announcer mention something about rabies. Mind you, like the Lanes, we are kept in the dark for most of the time about the origin of this zombie pandemic, too. Gerry watches as a man mutates before his eyes into a zombie after several minutes. When their vehicle breaks down, Gerry commandeers another vehicle. He careens off to a nearby high-rise apartment complex to wait for the United Nations to pick him up. Gerry's former U.N. boss Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena of 'Safe House') has a chopper pluck Gerry and his family from a rooftop just as zombies are about to take a munch out of them. Thierry flies Gerry to the safety of a U.S. Naval armada in the North Atlantic. Our hero learns that the President is dead; the Vice President is missing without a trace, and most of America bristling with zombies. U.N. officials want Gerry to locate patient zero. In other words, our long-haired, unshaven hero must find where the outbreak broke out. In the novel, the outbreak occurred in China, but Forster and company shift the blame to the poor Koreans. This isn't the first time that the Koreans have been substituted for the Chinese. Anybody who has seen either the 'Red Dawn' remake or 'Team America: World Police' should know that tidbit. Our reluctant hero balks at Thierry's proposal until he learns that they will fly him back to the zombie-infested City of Brotherly Love with his family unless he lends a hand. Afterward, Forster and company rarely let the action slacken for a moment unless the characters have to explain something to each other. The filmmakers treat us to sprawling scenes where zombies scale lofty walls like maniacal ants. Literally, they behave like suicidal Marines as many hurl themselves at walls and buildings to provide head, shoulders, and backs as platforms for others to climb. Zombies here react violently to noise and rampage after anything that makes noise. Rather than focus on the usual, tasteless, gut-munching melodramatics of most grindhouse zombie sagas, Forster drums up considerable tension and suspense with how our heroes elude the zombies. One white-knuckled scene depicts our heroes trying to sneak past zombies in a laboratory without arousing their attention. Naturally, our heroes aren't quiet enough and the zombies tear into them at the first sound.Although it makes use of the standard zombie movie conventions, 'World War Z' alters the formula. Our heroes find a means to stop the zombies from munching mankind. Basically, what Forster and his scripters have done is come up with the viral equivalent of smearing zombie blood and guts on your body so the undead won't recognize you as a snack. The proof is in the pudding, but the outcome lacks credibility and the narrative runs out of steam. Discretion prevents me from disclosing how Gerry and mankind get a foothold and blunt the zombie invasion. Incidentally, the military refers to zombies as 'Zekes.' The scenes at the airport, in the air, and on the ground in the medical research facility will keep you glued to your seat with dread. By the final 30 minutes, predictability asserts itself because you know Brad will come out of it alive with his family intact. For the most part, 'World War Z' takes itself seriously and shuns any attempt at ghoulish humor. Since the 1970s, the typical zombie movie ladled out the blood and gore like gravy and potatoes, but 'World War Z' shuns such shenanigans.",7,12,24,23 June 2013
Passengers," 'Titanic' In Space
","The adventurous science fiction romance 'Passengers,' starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, contains an initially appetizing premise. An enormous spaceship carrying 5000 passengers and a crew of 250, all of whom are asleep in hibernation pods for the 120-year journey through space to colonize another Earth-like planet, encounters complications with an asteroid field and a malfunction opens one of the pods. Our unfortunate hero awakens to find himself alone aboard the spacecraft with luxurious accommodations and recreational facilities, but he cannot resume his sleep no matter what he tries. Imagine being trapped all alone aboard a vessel reminiscent either of Douglas Adams' novel 'Starship Titanic' or Grant Naylor's novel 'Red Dwarf' cruising on auto-pilot through the icy desolation of the galaxy with nobody to turn to for relief and assistance. No matter what he does, our hero cannot get a response from anybody about his ordeal. Moreover, he won't interact with another human until the ship enters orbit around its destination in 90 years! Indeed, the only thing that he can do is share his anguish with an oblivious android that mixes alcoholic beverages behind the bar and indulge in the recreational outlets aboard the ship. 'Imitation Game' director Morten Tyldum and 'Prometheus' scenarist Jon Spaihts synthesize the classic films 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Titanic' in this promising 'what-if' scenario, but the characters aren't as compelling as the life and death crisis with which they must contend. Chiefly, Jennifer Lawrence's highly-strung, leading lady spends more time screaming than scheming, while the Chris Pratt hero tangles with a fate so tragic that he conducts himself in an ethically compromising manner that haunts him. Some of the obstacles that they confront are genuinely exciting, but 'Passengers' amounts to a thoroughly predictable yarn riddled with plot holes that neither Tyldum and Spaihts nor Lawrence and Pratt can triumph over in this 116-minute, PG-13 rated opus. Ultimately, when you consider everything that everybody could have done to improve this flawed film, it is really a shame that 'Passengers' doesn't live up to its potential.Basically, 'Passengers' reminded me of those adventures that intrepid pilgrims embarked upon to enter a promised land for a better life. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt of 'Guardians of the Galaxy') is a middle-class, mechanical engineer who cannot find his fortune on a vastly overpopulated planet Earth, so he books passage aboard the lavishly appointed corporate ferry Avalon for a faraway place designated Homestead II. There are two things that you should know from the outset about 'Passengers.' First, this sci-fi saga occurs so far into the future that all the guess work in space travel appears to have been accounted for by scientists so that nothing can possibly go wrong. Second, our hero and heroine don't contend with menacing alien creatures out to make a meal of them. Humanity is the only race that inhabits this half-baked escapade that wears out its welcome long before the Avalon reaches its destination. During the first 30 or so minutes, Jim Preston struggles to amuse himself aboard this spectacular spaceship. Some things about the craft are really cool. As it plies its way through the universe, this sophisticated, state-of-the-art spaceship has been designed to travel on auto-pilot with a huge, invisible shield deployed like a huge nose-cone to deflect anything perilous in its path. The asteroid field that it smashes its way through during the first few minutes evokes memories of 'Titanic,' but the toll that the asteroid field takes on the Avalon doesn't create problems right away. After he awakens, Preston takes advantage of all the opportunities that the ship offers. As it turns out, the hibernation pods are scheduled to open during the last leg of the voyage, with the crew awakening months prior to the passengers so they can prepare them for disembarkation. When Jim isn't floating in alcohol, he tries to break into the bridge where the crew sleeps. Meantime, Jim browses through the passenger database and finds Aurora and admires her in her translucent hibernation pod. Eventually, about a year later, Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence of 'The Hunger Games') joins Jim, and the fate that they are facing horrifies her. Jim has done everything that she suggests later to extricate them from their predicament. Initially, like all romantic movies, time takes a toll on Jim and Aurora's relationship, especially the conditions that prompted their rendezvous in space. We learn Aurora is a writer who wants to experience life first-hand on Homestead II and then return to Earth so she can write the first book about the experience. Unlike Jim, Aurora purchased a higher priced ticket and enjoys all the features of a first-class passenger. You can see the resemblance between 'Passengers' and the Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet 'Titanic.' Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt generate enough charisma to make a sympathetic couple. Nevertheless, they can only do so many things before 'Passengers' exhausts its spontaneity. The closest thing to another human is friendly android bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen of 'TRON: Legacy') that polishes glasses, mixes drinks, and listens to them. You can figure out where 'Passengers' is bound with its cliché-riddled 'boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back' plot. Once Jim and Aurora have broken up, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that something bigger must happen for them to repair the damage to their relationship. They must reconcile themselves and then figure out how to repair the catastrophic damage to the Avalon as it steadily deteriorates because of the asteroid field encounter. Lawrence and Pratt are more interesting than the one-dimensional characters that they portray. The arrival of another character to straighten things out doesn't really help matters in Spaihts' by-the-numbers screenplay. For the record, Hollywood has been struggling to develop this project for about a decade. Initially, Keanu Reeves and Reese Witherspoon were cast to play the two lovers, but scheduling difficulties derailed that enterprise. You won't get carried away with 'Passengers.'",5,8,19,2 January 2017
The Hunger Games," The Games We Play
","Futuristic science fiction yarns are usually dystopian. 'Pleasantville' director Gary Ross' adaptation of the Suzanne Collins bestseller 'The Hunger Games' sticks to the formula. Mind you, when we think about the future, we often dream about hopes fulfilled, life idyllic, etc. In dystopian science fiction, everything is a nightmare. In 'The Hunger Games,' America—as we know it—has long since collapsed after a devastating civil war. The post-apocalyptic society that emerges from the ruins—Panem—resorts to an annual televised spectacle as a way of controlling the masses. Twenty-four preteens and teens slaughter each other in a ritualistic sacrifice until only one survives. The Collins' novel appeared in 2008. Whether she knew about the sensational Japanese actioneer 'Battle Royale' is anybody's guess. In 'Battle Royale,' an entire class of high school children is gassed and shipped off to a remote island. They are armed to the teeth with every kind of weapon known to man and forced to kill until only one is standing. 'Battle Royale' was an audacious epic that went into graphic detail about violence. 'The Hunger Games' qualifies as a superlative thriller that softens the content of the violence. Make no mistake; children die in 'The Hunger Games.' This PG-13 rated kill-or-be-killed opus cannot compare with 'Battle Royale' in terms of sheer violence. No, I haven't read the novel, but friends have assured me neither Ross nor co-scenarist author Suzanne Collins have deviated drastically from the source material. Despite its distant futuristic setting, this exhilarating escapade is first a commentary about our current obsession with televised survival games. Second, this sci-fi fantasy recognizes of our insatiable bloodlust. Spectacles similar to 'The Hunger Games' occurred as back as the Roman arenas where gladiators fought to the death. Games of survival have been with us the dawn of time. Each year, the twelve districts that make up the nation of Panem randomly select two youngsters between 12 and 18 years of age. The districts send one boy and one girl each as 'tribute' to represent them in the homicidal games. Indeed, once the children arrive at the opulent Capitol, they are decked out in elaborate costumes and paraded around in chariots before a massive audience. An even larger audience watches them 'live' on television. We don't learn much about the government. Later, these contestants are shown how to wield swords, knives, bows & arrows, but they are not allowed to field firearms. Not only do experts train them in the use of these lethal weapons, but they also have others who coach them so they may attract patrons. These patrons are often useful. Sometimes they deliver crucial gifts during the game. These gifts almost always prolong survival. One wise mentor advises his student to treat the game as much as a popularity contest as a fight to the death. The other thing that will stand out is the way that the adults dress in 'The Hunger Games.' They look like they've received invitations for The Mad Hatter tea-party from 'Alice in Wonderland.' Stanley Tucci looks hilarious in his huge wig but has the time of his life chewing as Caesar Flickerman. He plays the equivalent to a talk show host.Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence of 'X-Men: First Class'), comes from an impoverished, Appalachia district where the men still plunge into the bowels of the earth to excavate coal. She is depicted as an underdog from the start and demonstrates how luck rather than physical strength enables her to survive. Actually, Katniss was not the chosen one. Instead, the lottery that the officials staged amid much pomp and circumstance at the district level picked Katniss' 12-year old sister Prim (Willow Shields) as the tribute. Since she volunteered to replace her sister, Katniss is allowed to offer herself as a substitute. As the young man who accompanies Katniss to the Capitol, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson of 'Bridge to Terabithia') is the son of a grocery store owner. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks of 'Man on a Ledge'), Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson of 'Zombieland'), and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) advise them in their respective roles as mentors and coaches. Peeta suggests they present themselves as 'star-crossed' lovers since he has a crush on her. Predictably, Katniss objects. Nevertheless, Haymitch persuades a stubborn Katniss to participate in the deception. You see, Katniss has feelings for a guy back home, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth of 'Knowing'), who loves her. Compared with most of her adversaries, Katniss is better prepared for the ordeal. She has spent considerable time hunting in the woods with a bow & arrow. We see her spear a bird in flight with one of her arrows. Later, she gives the adults a shock in one of the best scenes when she loosens an arrow into an apple. The most exciting scenes in'The Hunger Games' take place in a forested stretch of woods. Of course, this leafy arena is not altogether genuine. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley of 'Gone') supervises the games and orchestrates them from behind the scenes. The kids are loaded into tubes that lift them to the surface around a gigantic cornucopia piled high with supplies and bristling with weapons. Haymitch warns Katniss to head for the safety of the woods. Casualties are always heavy at the cornucopia. Later, he explains, she can pick up a weapon. Katniss follows Haymitch's instructions and scrambles into the woods as the carnage commences. The next time Katniss sees Peeta, he is roaming with a band lead by the pugnacious Cato (Alexander Ludwig of 'Race to Witch Mountain') who kills without a qualm. He enjoys snapping necks. Naturally, to align our sympathies with Katniss, she starts out as an underdog and benefits from a couple of patrons. The interesting thing is that physical strength is not synonymous with winning the games.Make no mistake, 'The Hunger Games' is going to make Jennifer Lawrence as popular as the 'Twilight' movies made Kristen Stewart.",9,2,9,31 March 2012
12 Monkeys," Another Mind-Blowing Gilliam Extravaganza
","'Brazil' director Terry Gilliam really goes off on a tangent with 'Twelve Monkeys,' an apocalyptic science-fiction, time-travel thriller about an individual from the future sent back to the past a la 'The Terminator' to ascertain the origins of a lethal man-made virus that nearly annihilated mankind. An Orwellian dystopia pervades virtually everything nook and cranny of the world in the year 2035. The survivors of humanity have gone into exile in the bowels of the Earth as a result of a devastating disaster that killed five billion people in 1997, and life is no picnic for them. Unlike most squeaky-clean, futuristic sci-fi sagas, 'Twelve Monkeys' is anything but sleek, sanitized, and ultra-modern. Instead, life is grungy, and science relies on technology that often malfunctions. Charles Dickens would describe it as 'the worst of times.' Indeed, Gilliam explores many of his favorite trademark themes with 'Blade Runner' scenarists David and Janet Peoples in this 131-minute, R-rated film. Not only is the line between reality and illusion thin but also it is never straight. Everything that obsessed Gilliam in his epic, landmark opus 'Brazil' is recycled in 'Twelve Monkeys,' but delivered in a tone that lacks the whimsy of the former film. Just as he mixed up everything to the verge of incomprehensibility, Gilliam keeps us off balance and out-of-kilter with one surprise after another in a storyline as crooked as a dog's hind leg. For example, our hero is sent into the past three times and two of those times he winds up in the wrong era. A shaven-headed, abject-looking, but pugnacious Bruce Willis stars as James Cole. (Oh, my God, check out those symbolic initials!) Cole weathers as much flak from the people in from his own time period as he does from the people in the past. Although he embarks on this odyssey as a sane person, he winds up doubting his own insanity by the time he reaches the right time period. The scientists recruited Cole for their scientific voyage in time because he possesses remarkable powers of observation. The scientists themselves look like they are on a weekend pass from the loony bin. Madeleine Stowe plays Dr. Kathryn Railly, a sympathetic psychiatrist from the 20th century who comes to Cole's aid after he is arrested and chained up in a Philadelphia Police station. She gets in committed to a mental institution that makes 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' look like a resort. Predictably, when Cole tries to convince Railly and her provincial labcoated colleagues that he has come from the future, they diagnose him as delusional. During his brief incarceration in the mental ward, Cole runs into a harmless, babbling lunatic played by Brad Pitt in a bravura performance that garnered him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. An animal rights activist, Jeffrey Goines (Pitt) assembles the eponymous army that Cole believes will usher in worldwide chaos and destruction. Incredibly, Jeffrey masterminds Cole's escape from the asylum. Christopher Plummer is cast as famous viral researcher Dr. Leland Goines who happens to be his father. Plummer adopts a magnolia-dripping Southern drawl that Pitt doesn't imitate. Haunting the periphery of this warped, psychological vortex, is Plummer's research assistant David Morse, who has more to do with the outcome that you initially believe because he doesn't garner as much screen-time as his co-stars. Frank Gorshin appears in a supporting role as Railly's superior. Ostensibly, Gilliam drew inspiration for 'Twelve Monkeys' from the 27-minute, 1962 French New Wave film 'La Jetee.' 'Twelve Monkeys' isn't an easy movie to understand and its vertiginous plot may leave some viewers baffled as well as frustrated.",10,0,0,17 March 2011
The 13th Warrior," 'The Thirteenth Warrior' Is A Winner!
","Thirteen turns out to be a lucky number for Antonio Banderas in 'Die Hard' helmer John McTiernan's adventure epic 'The Thirteenth Warrior,' Banderas' first movie since 'The Mask of Zorro.' This spectacular sword & sorcery saga about an ostracized Arab poet (Antonio Banderas), a dirty dozen of rugged Viking warriors, and a mysterious tribe of cannibalistic pagans clad in bear skins who devastate a helpless Scandinavian village resembles 'The Magnificent Seven'plus sixcrossed with 'Conan the Barbarian.' Derived from producer Michael Crichton's grisly novel 'Eaters of the Dead,' 'The Thirteen Warrior' emerges as a larger-than-life epic that should enthrall guys.When he wrote 'Eaters of the Dead' in 1976, bestselling 'Jurassic Park' novelist Michael Crichton obviously had 'Beowulf' on his brain. 'The Thirteenth Warrior' deconstructs the legend that most college freshmen have to suffer through in English Literature. If you recall, Beowulf was a famous Scandinavian warrior who responded to King Hrothgar's summons to slay the flesh-munching monster Grendel. After dispatching the vicious brute, Beowulf invaded Grendel's cave and butchered his beastly mom. In Crichton's spin on this saga, a savage horde of headhunters, who masquerade as demonic beasts and attack without mercy under the cover of darkness, have replaced Grendel. Like his literary counterpart, Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich of 'Red Scorpion 2') wins his reputation by spearheading a search and destroy mission behind enemy lines to axe the female chieftain.'The Thirteenth Warrior' takes place in the 10th century. As Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, Banderas portrays a well-bred Persian noble exiled from the medieval court at Baghdad for sexual indiscretions with the Caliph's wife. Ibn wanders the earth now as an emissary with his faithful manservant Melchisidek (Omar Sharif of 'The Burglars'), who acts as his translator. At a river crossing in Russia, they meet a rough-riding band of Viking marauders. Commemorating the death of their former leader, these stout-hearted Norsemen celebrate the promotion of Buliwyf as their leader.A weary messenger from King Hrothgar (Sven Wollter) stumbles into their camp with news about 'a terror that must not be named' that has besieged his kingdom. Buliwyf consults a soothsayer. Although he has assembled twelve of his best fighters, the old crone warns him that the thirteenth warrior must be 'one who is not from the North.' Before Melchisidek can translate the oracle's words, Ibn realizes that he has been conscripted. At first, the Vikings scorn Ibn, so some of the suspense is lost, while Banderas' narration covers those points not immediately obvious to audiences.The William Wisher & Warren Lewis screenplay keeps us in the dark about the cannibals. Indeed, in their refusal to unmask the villains, they cheat us out of the satisfaction of knowing exactly who these predators are. Instead, the filmmakers confer more artistic ambiguity on this medieval swashbuckler than it needs to measure up to its formulaic promise. Evilin a senselooms as something greater than any man-made incarnation.'The Thirteen Warrior' is a visual feast. 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance' lenser Peter Menzies shoots these brigands through gauzy filters so they look like titans. Horror movies usually delay unveiling the monsters in much the same way that McTiernan waits until the final quarter hour to expose the cannibals. The sequence where Buliwyf, Ibn and the Norsemen infiltrate the enemy lair and storm through a maze of caves to kill the female chieftain is in the same league with 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.' The free-for-all excitement that Menzies' fast-moving cameras impart enhances the atmosphere and suspense.Director John McTiernan helms this movie with a heavy hand. Alternating stunning battlefield footage with straightforward expository scenes about the characters and their enemy, he sacrifices anything approaching romance. Doom hangs palpably over 'The Thirteenth Warrior,' so moments of frivolity are ephemeral. Clearly outnumbered by hundreds of cannibals, the Vikings and Ibn feel as if they are living on borrowed time. Indeed, with broadswords shrieking through the air and decapitated heads flying off amid spurts of blood, McTiernan stages the combat without the same gladiatorial verse that Mel Gibson brought to 'Braveheart.' Aside from Banderas, the cast consists of little-known and unknown thespians whose characters are also eminently expendable. The Scandinavian cast rises to the occasion as the battle-hardened, suicidal Vikings. Second-billed actress Diane Venora as Queen Weilew utters a couple of lines. Venora's role appears to have been pruned along with the court intrigue, which is only hinted at in a scene where a Viking challenges one of Hrothgar's champions.Sometimes, 'The Thirteenth Warrior' seems almost too glum for its own good. While McTiernan and his scenarists exploit the cultural differences between Ibn and the Vikings for the bulk of the humor, this blood-drenched saga focuses more often on high-octane action than subtle nuances. The Viking hygiene scene is hilarious, but the humor is far too intermittent. The breathtaking scenery and the impressive battle scenes overshadow the clichés. Your breath will catch in your throat when our heroes confront the cannibals on a rain swept battlefield for the final engagement. Veteran film composer Jerry Goldsmith of 'Breakheart Pass' pumps up the action with another of his booming Wagnerian orchestral scores.If those hordes of dubbed spear & sandal epics that the Italians produced in the early 1960s appealed to you, 'The Thirteenth Warrior' qualifies as your kind of movie!",8,5,7,24 September 2008
Shaun of the Dead," The Funniest Zombie Comedy Ever!!!
","Director Edgar Wright's romantic splatter comedy 'Shaun of the Dead' qualifies as the funniest zombie movie ever made. This hilarious apocalyptic epic follows the antics of Foree Electric salesman Shaun (Simon Pegg of 'Hot Fuzz') his girlfriend Liz, ((Kate Ashfield), his best mate Ed (Nick Frost of 'Paul') along with their assorted friends, and Shaun's parents as they struggle to survive in an England overrun by zombies. The action takes place in one neighborhood and doesn't last for more than a week. The first twenty minutes sets up everything as our heroes remain blissfully ignorant about the enormity of the events occurring around them. Shaun and his girlfriend Liz have just broken up because he cannot seem to take her out anywhere without them ending up in a tavern called the Winchester. She hates the Winchester because Shaun takes her there all the time, and she wants variety in her life. When Shaun reminds that he took Liz to Greece, she points out that Greece was where they met! When the zombies finally invade the apartment that Shaun and Ed share with their mate Pete, our heroes have nowhere else to go but out. The first zombie who barges in is a one-armed fellow in a wedding tuxedo and he manages to effect entry because Shaun has forgotten for the last time to shut the door to their apartment. Afterward, they discover another zombie in their backyard; it's a girl named Mary and Nick shoves her so that she falls down on a pipe and impales herself. Naturally, Shaun's mother Barbara phones and informs him that his father Philip (Bill Nighy of 'Underworld') isn't feeling well. Shaun and Ed fight their way out of the apartment, appropriate Pete's car, and careen off with careen off with Ed at the wheel to Barbara's place, knocking down any zombie unfortunate enough to cross the path of their car. Initially, Shaun and Ed have it all planned out. In Shaun's imagination, they kill Philip and rescue his mom, and wind up back in Shaun's apartment with our hero drinking from a white mug with the word Cool on it. When they realize that they cannot return to their blood-splattered apartment, they end up at the Winchester Tavern. Things don't work out as they had expected. They wind up packing Mum and Philip into Philip's Mercedes. During this fateful drive, Philip reminds Shaun that he met him when Shaun was 12. Nick races over to Liz's apartment where Shaun persuades his ex-girlfriend along with David (Dylan Moran) and Dianne (Lucy Davis)to accompany Ed and his relatives to the Winchester. When they rush out to the Jaguar, David is wielding an umbrella while Shaun deploys a cricket bat.Our heroes have to abandon their car at one point and hike through twenty backyards. When they come to within sight of the the Winchester Tavern, Shaun warns them that the zombies have the establishment surrounded and besieged. Our heroes impersonate zombies so they can get through the crowd of walkers and inside the Winchester. Eventually, Shaun brandishes the rifle, but the zombies pour into the pub, and the chances of the protagonists surviving is considerably remote.Half of the hilarity about 'Shaun of the Dead' is the way that Wright stages the actions and edits it together for maximum comic impact. Simon Pegg is frantically funny as Shaun and Nick Frost adds to the laughs, especially at the end. Despite the obviously humorous subject matter, Wright has not balked at incorporating the splatter effects of most grade Z zombie flicks. Mind you, they emphasize the horrible spectacle of death in all the action scenes when the zombie tear into their victims with their teeth and at one point, Wright pays tribute to George Romero's 'Day of the Dead' as one fellow has his entire stomach torn apart in a crowd of ravenous zombies. George Romero applauded 'Shaun of the Dead' and this smart British production ranks as the best zombie comedy ever with snappy pacing and first-rate performances, particularly Bill Nighy as Philip.",10,1,3,1 November 2011
Argo," Taut Suspense From Start 2 Finish
","The Iranian hostage crisis escape thriller 'Argo' gives new meaning to the adage that truth is stranger than fiction. Ostensibly, this imaginative Warner Brothers release takes us back to the year 1979 when America as a superpower found itself cornered by a small but fanatical nation. Basically, Iran was exacting payback for our imperialist urges in the 1950s when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill persuaded President Dwight Eisenhower to help stage a coup and overthrow the civilian government. During the ill-fated presidency of Jimmy Carter, outraged Islamic militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November after their cancer-stricken sovereign, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had been installed as monarch by America, fled the country for sanctuary in America. This unfortunate episode with Iran is not one of America's star-spangled moments, any more than the U.S.S. Pueblo debacle in North Korea. The radical strongman—the Ayatollah Khomeini—replaced the tyrannical Shah, and Khomeini's minions violated the sanctity of our foreign embassy and abducted 52 hostages at gunpoint. These brave Americans suffered in captivity for 444 days before the U.S. managed to negotiate their release. Television news turned this unforgettable event into a nightmare that polarized Americans and torpedoed Carter's bid for a second term. Now, some 33 years later, actor/director Ben Affleck and fledging scenarist Chris Terrio have appropriated this historic subject matter for an audacious as well as inspirational espionage caper. 'Argo' should rank in the top ten of anybody's list of the best films of 2012. Despite its R-rating for profanity, 'Argo' qualifies as the kind of true-life adventure that should please not only armchair historians but also make us all feel a little prouder of our red, white, and blue.As the fury of a crowd besieging the U.S. Embassy in Tehran grows, a small number of diplomats—six of them—debate their options and quietly slip out a back door that the radicals aren't watching. They find sanctuary at the residence of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor (Victor Garber 0f 'The Town'), and tried to sit out the situation. During the last few moments when Americans controlled the embassy, everybody struggled to shred top secret documents. The Embassy personnel managed to turn enough paperwork into fodder so that the six workers weren't missed by the invading Iranians. Nevertheless, with each day, the predicament of these diplomats grew even more dramatic. They fear that when the Iranians discovered them that they will die horrible deaths. The Central Intelligence Agency shares similar sentiments and it hatches several harebrained schemes to save the six. CIA executive Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston of TV's 'Breaking Bad') invites one of best experts, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck of 'Good Will Hunting'), to sit in on the conference. Government officials present a number of scenarios for rescuing the hostages. For example, they plan to smuggle bicycles to them and await them at the border. Mendez takes a dim view of this option. Instead, he suggests they provide training wheels and meet them at the border with Gatorade. Nobody appreciates his sense of humor, and Mendez dreams up a scheme that seems even more insane. Mendez proposes to masquerade as a Canadian film producer, fly into Tehran, and waltz the six out under the nose of the Iranians as a team of filmmakers sent to scout locations for a science fiction movie! Eventually, despite massive misgivings, the CIA green lights the Mendez plan, and our hero goes into high gear to make it all happen with the help of an Oscar-winning Hollywood make-up artist, John Chambers (John Goodman of 'Red State'), and a shrewd movie producer, Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin of 'Inspector Clouseau'). They set up a production office and option an obscure science fiction screenplay named 'Argo' for which Siegel has nothing but contempt. Revealing anything more about the elaborate plot would spoil many surprises as well as the nail-biting tension that Affleck orchestrates.The worst thing you can say about 'Argo' is that it unfolds too slowly and methodically. Affleck and Terrio rely on history, intelligence, and wit to depict this suspenseful thriller. They do an excellent job of providing us with all the necessary history of Iran. Leaving the theater as the end credits roll will only serve to deprive you of some other surprises. Affleck visited former President Carter and Carter remembers the moment when he met Mendez. Meantime, 'Argo' skewers the film industry, too. John Goodman excels a sarcastic make-up artist and Alan Arkin brings multiple dimensional to Lester Siegel. Indeed, Arkin steals every scene in which he appears. Affleck and Terrio based their spine tingling saga on the 2007 article 'How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran' by Joshuah Bearman that 'Wired' magazine published. You can go on-line and read the informative article. Incidentally, although things went pretty much as planned, the CIA had to keep the affair hushed up until 1997 when President Clinton officially declassified the operation. Nevertheless, the liberties that the filmmakers take to enhance the dramatic impact aren't as drastic as you might imagine. Affleck and company deserve credit for not making the Iranian adversaries look like cretinous, one-dimensional villains. 'Argo' qualifies as one of the freshest, most stimulating films that you will ever see.",10,3,6,13 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Top-Notch Trek
","Movies have always reflected the concerns of society. Like 'Iron Man 3,' 'Star Trek Into Darkness' follows a cold-blooded terrorist through the galaxy who conjures up chaos in this science fiction 'Zero Dark Thirty' manhunt. Mind you, the filmmakers have refrained from identifying any specific ethnic or religious group in this 23rd century tale. 'Super 8' director J.J. Abrams' dynamic sequel reassembles virtually the entire cast as well as some minor characters from his 2009 'Star Trek' reboot. Remember those cadets who gave Kirk a bloody nose in Iowa? They're back, too. Similarly, Chris Pine returns as Captain James T. Kirk, along with Zachary Quinto as the pointy-eared Mr. Spock, Zoe Saldana as Lieutenant Nyota Uhura, Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy, and Simon Pegg as Lieutenant Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott. Unlike the original Roddenberry film franchise with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelly, nobody in Abrams' 'Star Trek' gets cheated out of screen time, particularly peripheral characters like John Cho's Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu and Anton Yelchin's Ensign Pavel Chekov. The performances are uniformly top-notch, with Pine relishing Kirk's action hero impetuosity and Quinto delivering his lines about truth and logic with a straight-faced, impersonality that makes you smile at his subtlety. Incidentally, Mr. Spock learns how to tell a lie without flinching in this outing. Urban gets most of the laughs with his observations about McCoy's shortcomings. Unfortunately, the traditional 'Trek' villains- those diabolical Klingons—are confined to just one scene while the senior Spock (Leonard Nimoy) appears briefly during a televised conversation between his younger counterpart and himself. Trekkers who hated the 2009 'Star Trek' will probably abhor 'Star Trek Into Darkness,' while more open-minded Trekker will embrace the changes.Every film franchise requires a treacherous villain. Happily, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' has forged a ferocious foe. Enigmatic Starfleet Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch of the BBC's 'Sherlock') with his glacial stare and warmly uttered words is so thoroughly malignant that you'd probably pummel the gifted British actor who portrays him. Basically, Harrison possesses several advantages over his adversaries that cannot be revealed without spoiling this suspenseful saga. Meanwhile, Harrison has a bomb detonated in downt0wn London during the year 2259.55 that galvanizes Starfleet into swift action. Specifically, Harrison blackmailed an officer assigned to Section 31 of a Starfleet archive to blow it up inside and then takes credit for the catastrophe. Gimlet-eyed Starfleet Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller of 'RoboCop') laments the deaths of 42 people in the explosion. As the calculating Harrison, Cumberbatch delivers such a hypnotic performance that he makes you forget anybody else is in the scene. He is the Magneto of the 'Star Trek' movies. Nonetheless, Weller provides stiff competition despite his considerably shorter screen time. Weller emerges as the equivalent of a hawkish, Strategic Air Command general from the 1964, Stanley Kubrick epic 'Doctor Strangelove' (1964) who wants to shoot first and forget any questions. Indeed, Admiral Marcus considers the Klingon Empire every bit as wicked as most SAC generals considered the Communist Empire. Marcus wants Harrison dispatched with extreme prejudice, and Kirk wants to personally execute those orders after Harrison launches an audacious attack on the war room with a helicopter-style gunship. This massacre reminded me of a similar scene in the Al Pacino epic 'The Godfather 3.' Afterwards, Harrison goes gallivanting off into forbidden Klingon territory where Starfleet lacks jurisdiction. Kirk resumes command of the Enterprise after violating a prime directive and pursues Harrison with an array of 72, new, photon torpedoes. Neither Mr. Spock nor Scotty approve of the idea of killing Harrison without the due process of a trial.Despite its ominous title, this splendid Paramount Pictures release doesn't hide in the shadows of its stellar predecessor. Actually, Abrams and 'Transformers' scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, abetted by 'Lost' co-creator Damon Lindelof have taken the franchise farther than the first. You get to see more of San Francisco and the futuristic contraptions that people travel around in. Watching 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is like—to borrow the cliché—riding a runaway roller-coaster on a figure-eight trestle with flames chasing you. Abrams and company give them a little bit of everything to do except travel in time. One scene has our hero and villain decked out like Buck Rodgers plunging through space This review covers the 2-D, not the 3-D version.. Prepare yourself for surprises galore as the filmmakers, clearly all fans of Gene Roddenberry's ground-breaking science fiction TV series, show you things that you might never have imagined or perhaps tolerated in earlier incarnations. The special effects look impressive, especially the space debris between the USS Enterprise and the USS Vengeance during a taut stand-off scene. Not only does the narrative take place on the Enterprise bridge but also on Earth in San Francisco as well as on a Class M Planet called Nimbus. Technically, although it is sequel, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is still a sequel to a prequel, making it a prequel, too. You'll understand the significance of this during the final moments when the crew of the USS Enterprise embark on their upcoming five-year mission. If you're a hardcore 'Star Trek' who can handle the liberties that Abrams and company have wrought, you'll probably want to see 'Star Trek Into Darkness' more than once. I grew up watching the original NBC-TV series when it first aired on Thursday nights. After the show's cancellation, I followed the Enterprise crew onto the silver screen and have thoroughly enjoyed the adventurous Abrams' prequels. The casting is as close to perfect as you can imagine. For the record, I've seen 'Star Trek Into Darkness' three times, and I'm eagerly awaiting its release on home video. This review covers the 2-D, not the 3-D version.",10,8,21,27 May 2013
Stripes," One of Bill Murray's First Box Office Action Comedies!
","'Meatballs' director Ivan Reitman scored his first major hit with this formulaic adventure comedy about a pair of civilian misfits who momentarily take leave of their senses and join the U.S. Army. Cab driver John Winger (Bill Murray) experiences one hideously terrible day when he loses his job, watches helpless as his car is repossessed, and his girlfriend walks out on him. In a fit of lunacy, Winger persuades his best friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis), who teaches English as a second language, that they can 'be all that they can be' if they enlist in the U.S. Army. Essentially, this uneven but hilarious spoof about military service succeeds because of Murray's outlandish sense of humor and 'Magnificent Seven' composer Elmer Bernstein's exhilarating score. No sooner have Winger and Russell gotten to boot camp than they confront their worst nightmare, crusty old drill sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates of 'The Wild Bunch') who hates Winger's smart aleck sense of humor. Hulka has Winger doing push-ups to straighten him out. When our misguided heroes try to go A.W.O.L., they encounter two sexy Army MPs, Stella (P.J. Soles of 'Jawbreaker') and Louise (Sean Young of 'Blade Runner') who bring them back alive. Meanwhile, our heroes have an incompetent officer, Captain Stillman (John Larroquette of 'Blind Date'), doing his best to berate them. The platoon that Winger and Russell land in consists of misfits, such as the overweight Ox (John Candy of 'Spaceballs'), witless Cruiser (future 'Miami Vice' regular John Diehl), wacky Elmo (Judge Reinhold of 'Beverly Hills Cop'), and sneering Psycho (Conrad Dunn of 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'). Most of what follows is predictable. Nevertheless, Bill Murray's improvisation skills serves him splendidly, particularly his 'big toe' speech in the barracks. Of course, Sgt. Hulka and Winger don't see eye-to-eye, and Hulka uses Winger's insolence to punish the entire platoon. This is about the time that they have their first date with Stella and Louise. At one point, pompous Captain Stillman wants to make our heroes repeat boot camp, after they embarrass him during a fight at a nightclub that sponsors mud wrestling with bodacious babes in skimpy attire. The night before graduation, Winger and Russell train their Army buddies how to perform complicated rifle movements so they can impress General Barnicke (Robert J. Wilke of 'The Hallelujah Trail') and they succeed in amazing the general with their adept rifle spinning skills. Indeed, General Barnicke is so impressed that he orders Stillman and his men to fly to West Germany and participate in his top-secret project involving a multi-faceted EM-59 Urban Assault Vehicle. Hulka gives everybody else weekend passes, but he orders Winger and Russell to remain behind on base and guard the EM-59, a 1970s GMC recreational motor vehicle equipped with technology galore, including a missile firing system. Stillman takes his blond babe of a girlfriend to show her the vehicle late one evening and discovers to his horror that the vehicle is missing. Winger and Russell have appropriated the recreational vehicle so that they can take Stella and Louise on a date. According to the sentry, Winger and company took the vehicle out to get it washed.Meanwhile, Stillman rounds up the platoon and they pursue Winger and company, except that they take a wrong turn and wind up in the Soviet Bloc where they are captured and subjected to torture. Although he advised Stillman against a rescue operation, Hulka joins Stillman but later leaps off the truck transporting Stillman and company after Winger and Russell. Our heroes pick up Hulka's distress signal and plunge into the Soviet Bloc in their souped up, military SUV, blow up a guard tower, and rescue their buddies. This action-packed finale marks 'Stripes' as an anti-communist movie as out heroes along with Stella and Louise get the drop on the poor border guards at the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and Winger ties them up and puts on a Czech uniform. A pitched battle rages as Winger and Stella, armed with machine guns, breaks Stillman and the platoon out, and hightail it back across the border. Along the way, Sgt. Hulka leaps onto the roof of the motorhome and rides out with them. Ultimately, Stillman is transferred to to a weather station near Nome, Alaska, while Winger, Russell, Hulka, Stella, and Louise come home to a hero's welcome. Ironically, in 'A-Team' fashion, nobody is seen either getting shot-up or killed during Winger's raid.",8,0,2,6 May 2010
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Family Friendly Fantasy Film
","The new family-friendly fantasy movie 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' (*** out of ****) qualifies as ideal fare for children that combines dazzling state-of-the-art computer-generated visual effects with 'live' human characters in an imaginative, action-packed fable teeming with talking animals and an evil witch. Irish-born author C. S. Lewis penned this children's classic back in 1950 about a quartet of kids who entered a fanciful land of adventure through the portal of a wardrobe in an empty room. Basically, a wardrobe is a piece of free-standing furniturelike today's closetsthat serves as a storage facility, here a place to hang winter overcoats. Imagine stepping into a closet and finding a whimsical world on the other side where woodland critters as well as fairy tale creatures can speak and where a villainous witch battles for supremacy for an enchanted kingdom, and you'll have a fair idea what to expect from 'The Chronicles of Narnia.' Earlier, in 1988, the British Broadcasting Company produced a TV mini-series version of 'Chronicles.' The people who made that 169-minute adaptation didn't deviate a notch from the printed page. Nevertheless, that largely faithful rendition suffered from shoddy special effects that amounted to the equivalent of a children's stage play with humans traipsing about in over-sized, idiotic animal costumes, supplemented with some cartoon-like animation that proved far from seamless. C.S. Lewis readers who demand literal interpretations of the acclaimed author's work would find this version, currently available on DVD courtesy of the BBC and Home Vision Entertainment, more to their liking. Although 'Shriek' director Andrew Adamson and scenarists Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely have taken some liberties with their big-screen adaptation, their film version 'Chronicles' sticks to the same essential storyline. Chiefly, Adamson and company have streamlined the novel's events and ramped up the drama without diverging from the source material. Indeed, in all but one episode of the movie, the filmmakers have actually improved Lewis' narrative and made it more palatable.'Chronicles' unfolds against the devastating aerial attacks launched by the German Air Forcethe Luftwaffeover London during World War II. Consequently, the Pevensie childrenPeter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucyare evacuated to the scenic splendor and serenity of the English countryside where they live with elderly Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent of the 'Bridget Jones' movies) in his huge house with hundreds of rooms and passageways, presided over by a grumpy old housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne of 'The Frighteners') who displays little patience for mischievous brats.In one of the major changes from the novel, our heroes accidentally break one of Professor Kirke's stained-glass windows while playing a game of cricket and hide from the nosy Mrs. MacReady. In the book, they hide from her, because she warned them not to interfere with the tours that she gave of the house to spectators. Anyway, they conceal themselves in a magical wardrobe. Earlier, the youngest PevensieLucyhad discovered that the wardrobe opened onto a fabulous faraway land where she had tea and cookies with a faun in his mountain hideaway. Initially, Lucy's brothers and older sister dismissed her story as poppycock. Later, Edmundthe most treacherous of the quartetdiscovered that Lucy had not been lying. He found his way into the snow-swept land, only to encounter the wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton of 'The Beach') who promised him a kingdom and a crown if would deliver the other three into her custody. We learn later on that the evil Witch fears this quartet because they are fated to rule over the land after her demise. It seems that the dastardly Witch has imprisoned the friendly faun that Lucy initially met, so Lucy and her kin resolve to rescue him. Eventually, Edmund defects and reports back to the Witch. Predictably, the Witch refuses to abide by her bargain with Edmund and dispatches a pack of ravenous wolves to capture the other Pevensies. A family of beavers befriends the Pevensies and helps them elude the wolves by means of an escape tunnel under their beaver house. This escape tunnelbuilt conveniently to accommodate our hulking heroes (what beaver would construct a tunnel with humans in mind?) and a subsequent escapade on a rapidly flowing roller-coaster of a riverconstitute the other major departures from the Lewis saga. Eventually, our heroes join the forces of virtue, an army of animals and mythical creatures, such as centaurshalf man/half horselead by a majestic talking lion named Aslan. Incidentally, translated from Turkish language, Aslan stands for 'lion.' Aslan emerges as the White Witch's mortal adversary.Unlike the low-budget BBC-TV version, director Andrew Adamson's 140-minute 'Chronicles' benefits from superb computer generated visual effects. The lion appears as realistic as if it were actual flesh and blood. Actor Liam Neeson of 'Batman Begins' provides a voice every bit as majestic as his visual counterpart. Although this yarn concludes with an epic battle between the Witch's legion and Peter's army, you won't spot a speck of blood and gore. Nothing in the PG-rated 'Chronicles' should induce anxiety in the minds of the film's target audience: children age twelve and under. While 'Chronicles' secretes a Christian message within its storychiefly Aslan's act of self-sacrifice, the movie never clobbers audiences over the head with its ideology. Similarly, C.S. Lewiswho penned his share of Christianity-oriented textsalong with high-brow literary tomes and science fiction outingsrefused to let his Biblical message overshadow the fantasy elements. Meaning, if you aren't looking of any religious propaganda in 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,' you'll never know it but still enjoy it.",8,0,2,16 June 2007
The Notebook," A Beautiful Tearjerker!!!
","'The Notebook' qualifies as one of the better Nicholas Sparks' romantic dramas. Ryan Gosling plays the young Noah Calhoun, and James Garner plays the elderly Noah. The love of Noah's life Allie is played by Rachel McAdams during her younger years and Gena Rowlands in her later years. Tragically, Allie suffers from dementia and winds up living in a nursing home. Noah enters the same nursing home so he can be with Allie, and he reads to her every day. She loves the story that he reads to her and constantly wonders how it is going to end, never realizing that Noah is her actual husband. Allie has bouts of memory loss, but Noah never forsakes her. As good as Gosling and McAdams are as the carefree, reckless lovers, Garner and Rowland anchor this amazing love story. Director Nick Cassavetes shifts back and forth between the young lovers and the elderly lovers. The only problem with this otherwise memorable film is that he slips up and reveals the identity of the Garner character too early while the younger Allie is trying to decide if she wants to marry for wealth or for love. This is a genuinely touching romance. Nobody gives a bad performance, and there is nothing trite about it. The last scene is guaranteed to make women cry.",9,0,1,11 April 2015
Public Enemies," Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' is Untouchable!
","'Miami Vice' creator Michael Mann recreates the Golden Age of Bank Robbery during the Great Depression in 1933 with his latest thriller 'Public Enemies' and gangsters riddle the screen with gunfire galore. This depiction of the rise to prominence of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the demise of John Dillinger is based on bestseller author Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' superstar Johnny Depp is cast against type as Dillinger, the sympathetic Robin Hood style desperado who acquired notoriety as 'Public Enemy No. 1.' 'Batman Begins' sensation Christian Bale impersonates the soft-spoken FBI Special Agent Melvin Purvis who brought Dillinger down. Although they drive vintage automobiles, blast away with vintage Thompson .45 caliber submachine guns, and wear vintage apparel, the characters in 'Public Enemies' prove to be just as enthralling as any of Mann's characters in his contemporary movies. Unfortunately, Mann doesn't always hit the bullseye for historical accuracy. Many of the events are reversed. For example, Pretty Boy Floyd died after John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis did not shoot him with a high-powered rifle. Similarly, Baby Face Nelson did not died before John Dillinger, but he perished long afterward. Moviegoers will cherish historical accuracy are in for several more surprises, but then 'Public Enemie' is just a movie. Suffice to say, anybody who has read anything about Dillinger will not be surprised at anything that happens in this biographical epic.'Public Enemies' opens with an interesting shoot-out at the Indiana State Penitentiary with a manacled John Dillinger getting escorted into the grim looking prison. This is the first of several surprises that occur for people who don't know much about 'Johnny' Dillinger. Afterward, Dillinger and his gang arrive in East Chicago where they have bribed the local constabulary to ignore them. They also receive some favors from the local bookmakers that operate a coast-to-coast wire service link-up that relates to gambling on horse races. Mann shows Dillinger robbing banks and playing 'spin the dial' with bank presidents. Dillinger has men stationed out in front of the banks as inconspicuous sentinels with weapons concealed under their coats. Dillinger's closest associate Red (Jason Clarke of 'Death Race') keeps the stopwatch running and knows when to wheel up to the front of the bank. Dillinger doesn't take money from any of the common folk in the bank. He steals only from the banks and then he takes hostages for a ride with him to ensure that the local authorities don't open fire on him when his gang cruises out of town.All of this publicity aggravates FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (Bill Crudup of 'Watchmen' in an awesome look-alike performance) and he assigns Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale of 'Terminator: Salvation') to manage the Chicago Office with orders to capture Dillinger. Purvis' shooting of legendary bank robber Charles 'Pretty Boy' Floyd (Channing Tatum of 'Step Up') in an orchard is what brought him to J. Edgar's attention. Purvis doesn't take long to realize that Hoover's smart young men aren't adequate for the task, and he requests help from the Dallas FBI Office. Several tough-looking, no-nonsense customers show up in Chicago who look like they were born with badges. Charles Winstead (Stephen Lang of 'Tombstone') and his cohorts stand out from the young, buttoned down types that surround Purvis. The FBI relies on telephone wiretaps and scientific analysis to monitor the Dillinger gang. When they cannot catch the gangsters squawking on the phone, they resort to more brutal methods, such as delaying medical treatment to a wounded bank robber to learn the whereabouts of the gangsters.Dillinger picks up coat check girl Evelyn 'Billie' Frechette (Oscar winning Parisian actress Marion Cotillard of 'La Vie en Rose') and cannot get her out of his system even when she walks off and leaves him after their initial encounter. Dillinger pledges himself to her, but she warns him that she doesn't want to watch him die. Things take a turn for the couple when Dillinger is captured in Tucson, Arizona, as Frechette and he are about to take a bath together and the authorities fly him back to Indiana. Dillinger's escape from Indiana is a part of criminal history. He wielded a fake wooden gun and bluffed his way out of jail. Later, he hooks up with Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham of 'Gangs of New York') to knock over a ripe bank in Sioux Falls with $800-thousand in its vault. Everything backfires on Dillinger and Nelson. They lug off barely $30-grand and then Purvis and his men surround the inn where the gang has taken refuge and a major firefight erupts with several gangsters dying in a blaze of gunfire.Johnny Depp bears a closer resemblance to John Dillinger than Christian Bale does to Melvin Purvis. Bale is actually taller than Purvis. Dillinger was idolized by many during the Depression and he strove to stay in the limelight so that the common people would harbor him when he was on the lam. According to Mann's version of history, Dillinger fell not only because of the persistence of Melvin Purvis and the FBI, but also because Dillinger brought too much heat onto his fellow criminals in the coast-to-coast racing rackets after Congress passed legislation against interstate crime. The cast is first-rate throughout 'Public Enemies.' Mind you, 'Public Enemies' doesn't lionize Dillinger to the outlandish degree that director Arthur Penn did rural desperadoes Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in 'Bonnie & Clyde,' but we get glimpses of Dillinger's celebrity status when the Feds fly him back to Indiana.'Public Enemies' ranks as the best gangster picture since Brian de Palma's 'The Untouchables.' The shoot-outs are noisy but relatively bloodless, though there is an interrogation scene where a detective roughs up a woman. Incidentally, many of the scenes were lensed on the actual locations where this story transpired.",10,7,15,5 July 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Tepid Arabian Nights Nonsense
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' producer Jerry Bruckheimer's antiquity-themed potboiler 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' qualifies as an anemic sword and sorcery fantasy with Jake Gyllenhaal of 'Brokeback Mountain' and Gemma Arterton of 'Quantum of Solace.' Loosely derived from Jordan Mechner's videogames, this adrenaline-fueled, ancient-times fantasy unfolds in the sixth century when Persia was a super power. A wrongly accused innocent must clear himself of a murderous crime he never committed, expose the real murderer, and deny him possession of a fabled dagger. The crystal hilt of this bejeweled dagger holds the sands of time. A man can rewrite history by pushing a button on the dagger. Although this far-fetched, family-friendly, special effects-laden spectacle rarely gives its characters a chance to catch their collective breaths, the sands run out of 'Prince of Persia' long before the story concludes with its happily-ever-after ending. Remember, 'Prince of Persia' bears the Disney Studios imprimatur. Original 'Punisher' scenarist Boaz Yakin and 'The Great Raid' co-scribes Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard have contrived a frenzied but forgettable actioneer about palace intrigue supplemented by cliffhanger heroics. This doesn't compensate for the dearth of compelling characters and quotable dialogue. The worst thing about 'Donnie Brasco' director Mike Newell's ancient times epic is that it is simply no fun. Mind you, the lightning-fast, ginsu knife editing pares everything to the minimum among camera angles galore, but the action doesn't leap off the screen in a metaphorical sense. Alfred Molina of 'Spider Man 2' plays the only character that has fun. Sadly, the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arterton is lukewarm.A miscast Jake Gyllenhaal with an Estuary accent looks uncomfortable as an 'Aladdin' style hero. He appears perfectly ridiculous beneath a black lion's mane of hair, while the villainous Ben Kingsley sports far too much eye-liner. Gemma Arterton emerges from this hokum with some dignity. Whether she is wielding a weapon or displaying her superior intellect, she makes a striking but not always triumphant heroine. Unhappily, most of the characters make little impression aside from their choice of weapons. Some of the CGI effects, particularly the slithering vipers, look too spurious. In his prime, actor Burt Lancaster could have done in real life every stunt that Jake Gyllenhaal performs with obvious support of CGI.As 'Prince of Persia' opens, we learn that Persia ruled the world from Asia to the Mediterranean. Persian King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) has two sons by blood, but adopts a third. Sharaman saw a street urchin named Dastan defy authority in a village and try to help another boy out of a jam. The King admired the youth's bravery so much that he adopted him. Fifteen years later, a grown-up Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal of 'Donnie Darko') has acquired a reputation for derring-do that defies good sense. Dastan's eldest brother Tus (Richard Coyle of 'Young Blades') and his mighty army approach the peaceful city of Alamut. Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) prepares her people for what she fears may be the fall of Alamut. None of her subjects believe that this is possible. Meantime, Tus' spies have informed him that Alamut has fired up forges and is mass producing arms for Persia's enemies. Wonder where the scenarists cooked up that plot? Tus has a conference with blood brother Garsiv (Toby Kebbell of 'RocknRolla') and his adopted brother Dastan. Dastan agrees that Alamut must be attacked, but he is disappointed when his brother Garsiv gets to lead the charge. Later that night, Dastan and his commando-style squad hit the city where it least expects it and opens it up for Garsiv to rampage inside. Tamina entrusts the legendary dagger to a warrior. As the warrior is with the dagger is leaving, he spots Dastan and tries to kill him. Dastan kills him and acquires the dagger. After the city falls, Tus proposes a marriage of alliance with Tamina. She considers the offer more seriously when she sees that Dastan has the dagger in his belt. King Sharaman arrives for the victory celebration, and Dastan presents him with a gift. It is an Alamut prayer regent's cloak. No sooner has Sharaman shrugged into the cloak than it ignites into a blaze that kills the monarch. Everybody points fingers at Dastan, but Dastan remembers that Tus gave him the present. Tamina shows him an escape route and he follows her on horseback into the desert. Tus offers a substantial reward on Dastan's head, and our hero and heroine fall in with an outlaw band of desert thieves lead by wise-cracking Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina) who hams it up with relish. Amar is an outlaw because he hates paying taxes that the government would use for unscrupulous ends. Dastan discovers the secret power of the dagger when Tamina tries to relieve him of it. Tamina brings him up to date on the mythical history of the dagger. It seems that the gods had decided to destroy mankind when one person stepped forward and raised their hand in protest. The gods relented and put the sand that they plan to use to destroy the earth deep into the ground. This sacred sand is the only kind of sand that makes the dagger magical. Dastan wants to get to Sharaman's trusted brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley of 'Shutter Island' and warn him about Tus' treachery.'Prince of Persia' duplicates virtually every search for hidden treasure movie that you've ever seen, including all the 'Aladdin' and 'Ali Baba' epics as well as the 'Mummy' movies and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' franchise. There is nothing here that you haven't seen before and seen done better. Moreover, once you've seen the hero turn back the hands of time to survive an encounter with an antagonist, it doesn't require much brain power to anticipate that more of this kind of nonsense will follow but on a grander scale, not matter how many important characters bite the dust. Make the 'Prince of Persia' a rental.",5,5,12,29 May 2010
Balls of Fury," 'Balls of Fury' is pathetic ping-pong porn!
","The people that created the hilarious Comedy Central cable TV series 'Reno 911' have only marginal success with their new table tennis sports movie parody 'Balls of Fury' (** out of ****), about a former ping-pong prodigy past his prime who helps the FBI nab the nefarious Asian mastermind that killed his father. Sadly, despite its inventive comic premise and celebrity cast, this low-brow farce depends on bowel humor and lowest common denominator jokes for its laughs. Okay, you'll smirk a lot at what masquerades as comedy in this lean but lame 90-minute nonsense. You might even snicker at the groaners, but you'll seldom laugh out loud for long. Incidentally, the 'Star Wars' epics and 'Scarface' provide the inspiration for much of the uninspired dialogue. The wit in the script by 'Reno 911' writers Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant is as anal as it is banal, but the PG-13 rating prevents them from stooping too low. When was the last time, for example, that you saw a character in a movie get punched or kicked in the crotch for a laugh? Worst of all, chubby newcomer Dan Fogler looks funnier than he isan obvious Jack Black wannabe with none of Black's drollery.As 'Balls of Fury' unfolds, we meet clean-cut, curly-haired Randy Daytona (Brett DelBuono of 'The Casket'), a twelve-year old who wields a mean ping-pong paddle. Randy makes it to the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea, but he suffers a humiliating defeat from the paddle of his maniacal Soviet Bloc opponent Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon of 'Reno 911') and quits the game. Not only does Daytona lose the championship, but also his coach as well as father--U.S. Marine sergeant Pete Daytona (Robert Patrick of 'We Are Marshall')--dies at the hands of the infamous Asian criminal, Feng (tough guy Christopher Walken of 'Pulp Fiction'), because he cannot pay off his debt. Meanwhile, Feng becomes a legendary crime lord and strives to keep his identity a closely guarded secret. Nineteen years pass, and woebegone Randy grows up and out (Dan Fogler) to emerge as a lounge act in a small Reno, Nevada, casino. Randy keeps several balls at a time in the air with his paddle with expertise of a juggler. A guy with a talking cockatiel announces his act. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong for poor Randy. He solicits a volunteer from the audience to participate in a gag, and the guy drops dead from a heart attack because Randy's ping-pong balls strike him in such rapid succession.Enter the FBI. Agent Ernie Rodriquez (George Lopez of 'Real Women Have Curves') recruits Randy to assist the Bureau in their Feng investigation. They want Randy to come out of retirement and win enough games so that Feng will invite him to one of his illegal underground table tennis tournaments held once every five years. The Bureau wants to bust Feng for international arms smuggling. Despite his expertise, Randy has lost his competitive edge, so Rodriquez enlists a championship ping-pong teacher, Master Wong (James Hong of 'Chinatown'), to train him. The catch is that Wong is blind. Naturally, Wong walks into fences, looks the wrong way, and takes a nasty plunge down an elevator shaft. Wong makes Randy appear foolish when Wong's slim, sexy, athletic niece Maggie (the woefully underused Maggie Q of 'Live Free or Die Hard') whips him repeatedly at ping-pong. Eventually, after an initial setback against Hammer (Patton Oswalt of 'Cake Boy'), a trophy licking wiseacre, Randy regains his skill and Feng invites him to his secret play-offs. The losers here get a poison dart in the neck in what Feng calls 'single-elimination, sudden death matches.' Feng tries to tempt Randy to 'go over to the dark side' and join him in his weapons smuggling operation. Feng has designed an automatic pistol made of polymer so that it doesn't trip airport alarms.Clearly, writer/director Robert Ben Garant and co-scenarist Tomas Lennon are poking fun at the classic Bruce Lee martial arts masterpiece 'Enter the Dragon' with their premise about secret ping-pong ball play-offs. The idea that a relatively harmless sport like ping-pong can be as lethal as a kung fu tournament is the source of most of the film's best humor. Some of the participants--who can spin these tiny white balls on their fingertips, crush with their fists, and slice and dice them with a hatchet--are amusing characters, too. 'Balls of Fury,' however, runs most of its humor into the ground as well as elsewhere. Our heroes must smuggle mini-flashlight sized tracking devices into Feng's Central American headquarters. These devices will alert their FBI back-up as to their whereabouts. Yeah, you guessed, they enter Feng's premises walking a bit off-kilter with their FBI suppositories. Another example of the lowest common denominator humor here concerns host Feng supplying his guests with exotic courtesans that turn out to be male sex slaves. When Randy tries to send muscular young Gary (Dietrich Bader of 'Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous') away, Gary refuses to leave. He explains that Feng's towering bodyguard, Mahogany (Aisha Tyler of 'Death Sentence'), a Grace Jones look-alike who uses a blow-pipe to launch poison darts, will kill him. Homophobic Randy spends the entire night with Gary playing a board game to keep from falling asleep.'Balls of Fury' isn't half as funny as 'Reno 911,' though it does have its moments. This is Dan Fogler's first major role, and he hasn't been around long enough to establish a signature comic persona like co-stars George Lopez, Patton Oswalt, and Christopher Walken who parades around in some of the most outrageous outfits this side of Elton John and Elvis Presley. Altogether, 'Balls of Fury' lacks both the balls and the fury to be the side-splitting sensation that it sought to be.",4,1,6,5 September 2007
Ted," Funny But Offense Farce About A Potty-Mouthed, Pot-Puffing Teddy Bear
","The crude but clever Mark Wahlberg comedy 'Ted' resembles something you'd expect from Adam Sandler. Cretinous heroes, gross out humor, wanton drug abuse, and offensive profanity constitute the primary elements of this witty satire. Indeed, this far-fetched, off-beat, politically incorrect farce is the last thing you would expect from a mainstream actor who specializes in straightforward action thrillers. While it doesn't qualify as the kind of movie Wahlberg typically makes, 'Ted' is precisely what you might expect from cheeky 'Family Guy' creator Sean MacFarlane who penned the outrageous script with 'Family Guy' co-scribes Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild. This amusing but brazen, 115-minute nonsense veers from bromance to romance with our hero caught between his pot-smoking, potty-mouthed teddy bear and his drop-dead gorgeous brunette girlfriend. Aside from its impudent title character, 'Ted' doesn't look like a run-of-the-mill summer movie with its $50-million budget about a walking, talking teddy who delivers the best lines. Not only do Wahlberg and Mila Kunis hold their own against the cuddly CGI hero, but also this unusual threesome generates tangible charisma. Wahlberg and Kunis make their relationship with the eponymous character appear believable even though we know they were not interacting spontaneously with Ted as they do in the finished film. Moreover, MacFarlane and his writers keep things breezing along in this contentious relationship that generates suspense about whether our hero and heroine will survive as a couple. One thing is unmistakable; 'Ted' has nothing comparable to compete with in the genre of supernatural characters. The closest thing to 'Ted' might be the extraterrestrial comedy 'Paul' about an E.T. type alien who lands on Earth and befriends two British tourists in the American Southwest. Some critics have compared 'Ted' to the Mel Gibson movie 'The Beaver,' about a depressed, suicidal fellow who wears the puppet of a beaver on one arm and becomes its pawn.Basically, Wahlberg plays a physically grown-up but mentally immature adult who has put his life on hold to raise hell with his party-animal teddy bear. What sets 'Ted' apart from other comedies is the unconditional love that a 35-year old loser shares with his childhood plush toy. Our hero leads a sheltered life as a youth in a town just outside of Boston. The neighborhood kids refused to play with John Bennett. When eight-year old John interrupts several kids in the middle of beating up a Jewish boy, all of them—including the victimized Jewish child—send him packing without a qualm. Since he had no friends, John makes a wish on Christmas Eve in 1985 that his teddy would be his best friend. Little does John know that when he made his wish that a falling star plunged from the night skies. Miraculously, John's wish is granted, and the teddy bear talks to him the next morning. Overnight Ted turns into a national media sensation. At one point, he appears as a guest on the Johnny Carson late night talk show. Ted enjoys his fifteen minutes of fame before he resumes living life as usual with John. Eventually, John has reaches a turning point with his long suffering girlfriend, Lori Collins (Mila Kunis of 'The Book of Eli') who urges John to kick Ted out so they can have a life alone. Evicting Ted proves to be virtually impossible for our hero. Surprisingly, Ted makes the transition from staying with John to landing a job in a supermarket as a check-out clerk and getting an apartment of his own. Nevertheless, although he has given Ted the boot, poor John cannot resist Ted's invitation to visit him daily. Everything isn't fun and games for Ted and company when a creepy admirer, Donnie (Giovanni Ribisi of 'Contraband') and his weird son Robert (Aedin Mincks of 'Faster') show up and try to buy him for John. These two characters are obnoxious and their appearance ushers in a grim and unsavory air of reality to the action.Rookie writer and director Seth MacFarlane has forged the funniest cinematic character in a long time with the wise-cracking, title character. Ted looks cute, but he is rude, crude, and lewd. He curses like a sailor, smokes a bong like a chimney, and likes to date prostitutes. 'Ted' qualifies as an unforgettably funny, live-action/CG-animated comedy. Happily, the 'Ted' character is seamlessly integrated into the action, and his shenanigans are consistently hilarious. Whether he is driving his best friend to work with extensions so his short legs can reach the brake and the gas pedals or performing T.J. Hooker leaps from the rear of a station wagon to the hood of our heroine's car, Ted looks as life-like as a CGI character can. The motel room fistfight that he has with John where he pummels him into submission and his amorous stockroom assignation with a sexy cashier emphasizes Ted's rowdy as well as randy antics.While teddy bears have been fodder for children's movies over the years, 'Ted' is nothing like 'Winnie the Pooh.' When MacFarlane isn't having fun with Ted and company, he appropriates a cult science fiction film and integrates it as an essential element of this whacky fantasy. Ted and John grew up watching the movie 'Flash Gordon' (1980) with Sam J. Jones and have enshrined it. However, MacFarlane isn't content merely to insert excerpts from the film. Since both Ted and John worship Sam J. Jones, the 'Flash Gordon' star winds up making a cameo for two rip-roaring scenes. MacFarlane borrows a mocking scene or two from the spoof masterpiece 'Airplane' when our hero meets the heroine on the dance floor of a 2008 disco and mimics the movements of John Travolta's 'Saturday Night Fever' romance. Patrick Warburton of the 'Rules of Engagement' television series and 'Green Lantern' lead Ryan Reynolds have a scene where they play two gay guys who kiss.'Ted' is never tedious and will tickle your funny bone.",8,2,7,15 July 2012
Knives Out," A Cutting Edge Crime Comedy
","James Bond actor Daniel Craig plays amateur sleuth Benoit Blanc in 'Looper' director Rian Johnson's elaborate, tongue-in-cheek whodunit 'Knives Out' (***1/2 OUT OF ****) who describes the murder as a donut. He clarifies, however, that inside that donut is a second donut with its own hole. This convoluted crime caper is neither blood-spattered nor gruesome, so nobody need complain about anything looking remotely offensive. Indeed, we are given a glimpse of the murder victim after he has slit his throat, but the camera doesn't linger on this unsavory scene. Although profanity is held to a minimum, the F-word is uttered once, while the S-word is heard multiple times. Meantime, Johnson keeps everything fairly lighthearted throughout this 130-minute melodrama, with enough red herrings to keep you guessing about the identity of the killer. Mind you, the culprit is neither an intruder nor a blade-wielding maniac, but simply an irate member of a flawed family who feels betrayed by the family patriarch.Basically, world-renowned, bestselling mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer of 'Waterloo') appears to have committed suicide with his family ensconced on the premises. Thrombey's dysfunctional clan had converged on his secluded estate deep in the Massachusetts woods to celebrate his 85th birthday. 'Knives Out' boasts a first-class cast, featuring Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, and Christopher Plummer. Veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh also makes a cameo. Although it rambles on loquaciously for two hours and ten minutes, Johnson jams a lot of action and exposition into those two plus hours to keep it amusing. Each of the family suspects in this murder-mystery is given as close to a three-dimensional character as time permits. Not surprisingly, each has a legitimate reason to want Harlan dead, and they lie not only to the authorities but also to Benoit Blanc.Relying largely on red herrings (false clues), flashbacks, and testimonials from Thrombey clan members, 'Knives Out' chronicles the investigation of Harlan Thrombey's death, which has all the earmarks of a suicide but turns out to be a homicide. Half of the action takes place at the Thrombey estate, while other scenes occur at Marta Cabrera's apartment in the city. An amusing car chase also transpires in town as well as a discovery later at an abandoned laundromat. Known as 'the last of the gentleman sleuths,' Benoit Blanc assists the local constabulary in their homicide investigation. Apparently, following his 85th birthday party, Harlan Thrombey settled down for the evening in his upstairs den. After his nurse Marta (Ana De Arma of 'Knock Knock') had administered his evening injections, she departed at approximately midnight. Harlan's grown-up son Walt (Michael Shannon of 'Man of Steel') saw him later that same night. The following morning, Harlan's housekeeper, Fran (Edi Patterson of 'Troop Zero'), discovers his dead body and his slashed throat. While the police grill family members, Blanc lounges in the background, plinking on a piano. He shadows the detectives, but he doesn't believe a single word any of the family members utter. Everybody carries a chip on their respective shoulders where Harlan was concerned. Walt handled Harlan's publishing business, while the rest of the family benefitted from the elder patriarch's largesse. Nevertheless, Harlan has changed his will and written his entire family out of it! He has uncovered treachery on their part and punishes them for their deceit. Rather than turn his $60 million fortune and publishing empire over to them, Harlan wills it to his trusted nurse. Naturally, the Thrombey family is shocked. Initially, each had promised to take care of Marta. They treated her as part of 'their family,' but now they urge her to return the money to them.Eventually, the truth of the matter, particularly Harlan's suicide, comes out. Nothing about it, however, is neat. As it turns out, Marta and Harlan had their own respective alibis. Moreover, it is ironic that things happened the way they did. One question that has baffled Blanc the entire time is his contribution to the investigation. He reveals that he received an envelope without a return address, but it came packed with a thick wad of greenbacks. Somebody in the family apparently wanted him to scrutinize all the testimonies and unearth something the police may have overlooked. As the audience, one of the first things we're shown occurs during Harlan's medical injections. It appears that Marta had gotten the prescription bottles switched, and she gave him a larger injection of Morphine than usual. Afterward, Marta ransacks her medical bag, but she cannot find the antidote for a drug overdose. Harlan realizes that he will die in several minutes, and he concocts a scheme that will not incriminate Marta. Furthermore, he also plans to commit suicide in an effort to conceal the wrong injection. Marta finds it difficult to answer questions truthfully. Moreover, she suffers from a peculiar condition which prompts her to projectile vomit after she tells a lie. Repeatedly, Johnson has a field day with Marta's projectile vomiting as a recurring gag.If you thought Daniel Craig was hilarious as Joe Bang in 'Logan Lucky,' you'll be in stitches at his ersatz Southern accent that owes more to Foghorn Leghorn than Tennessee Williams. Craig plays a character diametrically opposite from his James Bond. Benoit Blanc is actually a little goofy as are most of the characters. Johnson ridicules all the Thrombey clan, except Marta. In the long run, Benoit solves the murder with a little help from the self-sacrificing Marta, and the guilty party is exposed. Benoit qualifies as the equivalent of the legendary Agatha Christie character Hercule Poirot. Furthermore, unlike his role as James Bond, Craig's latest character relies on his wits rather than his mitts in unraveling the tangled web of duplicity. The Thrombey Estate is something to see, and the multi-storied house with several flights and noisy stairs is the perfect setting for this quasi-Agatha Christie pastiche. Altogether, 'Knives Out' qualifies as a cutting-edge, murder-mystery comedy.",9,1,3,20 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," 'Spider-man 2' dwells on an identity crisis that young Peter Parker must contend with
","The best parts of the latest 'Spider-man' movie 'Spider-man 2' (*** out of ****) have nothing to do with either state-of-the-art computer generated special effects or dazzling high-octane action sequences. Instead, 'Spider-man 2' director Sam Raimi allows his comic book characters to sit down and discuss their human foibles and frailties with friends. Sometimes, these characters hear things that don't make them happy. In fact, 'Spider-man 2' dwells on an identity crisis that young Peter Parker must contend with if he is to maintain his future as an anonymous crime fighter. Imagine Hamlet in a web. The lesser parts of 'Spider-man 2' focus on Spidey's latest adversary: Dr. Otto Octavius, an exceptionally gifted scientist who accidentally transforms himself into a multi-tentacled terror. Unfortunately, the super heroic sequences appear less than super heroic, and you almost want the Green Goblin from the clearly superior 'Spider-man' (2002) to return for an encore. Actually, Willem Dafoe does have a cameo in 'Spider-man 2,' but he spends no more than a few minutes on screen as Norman Osborn rather than the villainous Green Goblin. Aside from Dr. Otto Octavius, everybody who showed up for the first 'Spider-man' epic came back for the sequel, including Tobey Maguire as the web-slinging protagonist, Kirsten Durst as Spiderman's romantic interest, James Franco as Peter Parker's best friend, Rosemary Harris as Peter's Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as irascible newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson.'Spider-man 2' picks up the plot no more than a couple of years after its blockbuster predecessor with Peter Parker struggling to make ends meet in both his personal and professional life. Never has an alter-ego super heroic character suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as Spider-man. Peter loses a pizza delivery job, because he kept taking time off to play masked crusader. On the way to deliver pizzas, Peter spots two kids on a collision course with a truck and saves them. Nevertheless, he misses his delivery deadline, and his heartless boss cuts him loose. When Peter comes home from the university he attends in New York City, he tries to elude his rent-harassing landlord. Russian actor Elya Baskin of 'Air Force One' has a field day as Peter's obnoxious landlord. Director Sam Raimi and writer Alvin Sargent overplay Peter Parker's nerdy image, taking it to seeming Woody Allen lengths. Furthermore, Peter desperately wants to hook up with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst of 'Mona Lisa Smiles'), but every time he tries to see her, he finds himself diverted to thwart criminal acts. Inevitably, Peter struggles with serious doubts about whether he should be 'Spider-man.' When he encounters trouble slinging webs, he worries about his ability to battle crime. Eventually, Peter trashes his 'Spider-man' suit and behaves like an average ordinary college kid, ignoring the sight of thugs mugging a helpless victim in a back ally. Of course, Peter shrugs off these doubts when it becomes obvious he must foil Dr. Octavius' homicidal plans.Essentially, scripter Alvin Sargent of 'Ordinary People' & 'Unfaithful' juggles three story lines in a 127 minute melodrama that runs about twenty minutes too long. Not surprisingly, since there are three plots in motion: the Peter Parker/Spider-man identity crisis; Peter's romantic pursuit of Mary Jane Watson; and Spider-man's battle against Dr. Octavius, you can expect just as many endings. Suffice to say that Spidey's face-off with Dr. Ock is hopelessly predictable. First, Spider-man cannot die. Second, their confrontation lacks magnitude. While Alfred Molina is a good actor, he looks miscast as web-crawler's arch-foe. Molina's Dr. Ock seems more flabby than frightening, and his character drags 'Spider-man 2' down to the level of a formulaic 'Superman'/'Batman' cliff-hanger. The quiet, simple moments when Peter Parker reveals the truth about events from the first 'Spider-man' or about his feelings for Mary Jane emerge as the most dramatically satisfying in this curiously introspective, morality-driven, summer action thriller. Sargent's dialogue is probably the best thing about 'Spider-man 2,' because it sounds believable. What director Sam Raimi did with the original 'Spider-man,' he does with less success in the sequel. 'Spider-Man' qualified as a breath of fresh air in the largely stale super hero genre, because Raimi and company reinvented their hero and brought him down to the level of an ordinary human with extraordinary powers. Tobey Maguire hasn't forgotten that quality, because he plays Peter Parker not so much as a super hero but as a guy with other problems when he isn't climbing walls after criminals.Long-time 'Spider-man' fans will appreciate 'Spider-man 2' and judge it less critically for its flat spots and its loyalty to Marvel comics. If you haven't seen the first 'Spider-man,' you may find yourself in the dark about parts of the plot. Virtually all the characters from the first 'Spider-man' appear on screen, bringing plot threads from the original with them. Raimi manages to counterbalance the comedy and drama, but he over-emphasizes Peter Parker's nerdy nature. Altogether, while it doesn't surpass the original, 'Spider-man 2' is still worth watching once.",8,3,4,21 June 2007
Blade," The Best Thing to Happen to Vampire Movies Since 'Dracula'
","Actor & producer Wesley Snipes may have finally found himself an action movie franchise that he can sink his teeth into with British director Stephen Norrington's 'Blade,' a well-made, imaginative, adrenaline-laced vampire chiller based on the Marvel Comics' super hero. Snipes heads a first-rate cast that includes Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Dorff, N' Bushe Wright, Udo Kier, and Traci Lords. 'Blade' synthesizes the exotic swordplay of the 'Highlander' epics, the double-digit body count of a John Woo thriller, and the martial arts pandemonium of a Jackie Chan opus to spawn a horror movie several cuts above your ordinary vampire fare. If the sight of blood, especially torrents of bogus blood, turns your stomach, avoid 'Blade.' 'Blade' takes its cues from renegade vampire sags like Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996) and Kathryn Bigelow's 'Near Dark' (1987) rather than those venerable classics such as either Tod Browning's 'Dracula' (1931) with Bela Lugosi or Neil Jordan's 'Interview with a Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles' with Tom Cruise (1994). The Snipes hero must have chose the same guy who tailored 'Mad Max' and 'The Terminator' in what essentially constitutes an apocalyptic version of Fran Rubel Kuzui's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' (1992). 'Blade' qualifies as a tour-de-fang chiller with darker humor than 'Buffy,' top drawer special effects, and an infectious techno-pop soundtrack. Lowbrow escapism that it ranks as, 'Blade' benefits chiefly from scenarist David S. Goyer's solid, seasoned writing skills and atmospheric, innovative helming by sophomore director Stephen Norrington.Scenarist David S. Goyer provides an invigorating screenplay. 'Blade' bristles not only with lively action and adventure, but also an intelligible plot that the characters go to extreme lengths of describe and discuss. When you consider that Goyer has penned scripts for 'Dark City,' 'The Crow 2: City of Angels,' 'Robert Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,' 'Demonic Toys,' and 'Kickboxer 2,' then you know he qualified as the ideal choice to pen the script. Goyer's revenge fantasy script never leaves you in the dark about a bloody new world where its embattled but immortal hero Blade wages a perennial war against vampires. Goyer shows impressive flexibility in co-opting vampire mythology. At one point, a half-blooded vampire smears on sun screen lotion to shield himself from the sun. Jealous vampires put one of their vampire enemies to death by gradually exposing him to sunlight at dawn. Meanwhile, our hero uses an ultra-violet light to singe unruly fangsters. About the only vampire trait neglected by Goyer is the ability to shape-shift into a bat.A vampire infected our protagonist's pregnant mom, Vanessa Brooke (Sanaa Lathan of 'Love & Basketball') with its venomous blood while she was carrying Blade in her womb. Delivered by Caesarean section from his dying mother, Blade emerges as neither totally human nor truly vampire. He can walk in sunlight without risk, and neither silver nor garlic can faze him. One villainous vampire admires Blade when he observes that Blade has 'all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.' The filmmakers milk dramatic tension from Blade's growing tolerance to Whistler's (Kris Kristofferson of 'Convoy') anti-venom serum. The chance that Blade may not revert to his vampire origins not only lurks in the background but also enhances the suspense. This element of uncertainty generates anxiety and endows the protagonist with an Achilles' heel that makes him seem more believable and charismatic. Blade cruises around in a black 1968 Dodge Charger.Legendary vampire hunter Abraham Whistler found Blade as a juvenile roaming the streets and living off the blood of derelicts. Transforming Blade into a super hero with injections of a blood substitute, he serves as Blade's stepfather and ordnance maker. Surprisingly, Whistler lasts longer than most sacrificial characters. Loosely modeled on the Roman god Vulcan who forged weapons for the deities, Whistler trains Blade to slay vampires with extreme prejudice. Blade approaches his crusade with the enthusiasm that Charles Bronson mustered for killing muggers in the quintet of 'Death Wish' movies. Not surprisingly, more than enough vampires survive from other parts of the world for Blade to combat in the sequels. Wow, does 'Blade' ever leave itself wide open in its wrap-up in Russia for a sequel! Anyhow, the vampires in 'Blade' are not tooth fairies. Organized into a powerful, global underground syndicate, Dragonetti (Udo Kier) presides over them as a Corleonesque godfather. The scene in the shadowy conference room with vampires dressed in suits is effectively creepy. Kier's Dragonetti is a pure-blooded fangster in a world of full and half-blooded vampires. In 'Blade,' the cities of the world have been practically undermined by vampires. Vampires have gained leverage in the business and politician arenas. These vampires own the police so they control the law. As the snotty, upstart Deacon Frost, actor Stephen Dorff plays the half-breed vampire who Dragonetti turned. Frost harbors greater ambitions than Dragonetti. The elder vampire prefers to co-exist with mortals and abide by their treaties. Frost demands that the vampires dominate humanity. Secretly, Frost has been translating the ancient vampire text, The Book of Erebus, which will enable him to resurrect vampire blood god La Magra. Frost wants to revive this demon, but he needs the missing link: Blade's blood. Frost calls Blade 'day-walker,' because the vampire bible has prophesied Blade's unique genetic make-up. If he can revive this blood god, Frost can control the House of Erebus that rules the undead, and vampires can emerge as the dominant force in the world. The splashy finale in a phantasmagoric vampire temple with skeletons bursting out of the mouths of vampires in a storm of jagged lightning bolts owes a little to 'The Fifth Element' as well as 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' (1958), but this scene is fully and logically integrated in Goyer's script.Sure, 'Blade' amounts to nothing more than bloody pulp fiction. Nevertheless, Goyer and Norrington have reinvented vampire thrillers. 'Blade' is entertaining, somewhat cheesy, but technically proficient hokum done with considerable technical prowess. Congratulations Stan Lee!",9,1,3,26 June 2008
Creed," It's Really Rock 7
","Movie sequels thrive on similarity. Sequels either carbon copy the original or follow-up it up with something similar but different. 'Fruitvale Station' writer-director Ryan Coogler's 'Creed,' starring Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, could have taken advantage of an obvious franchise title like 'Rocky 7.' Mind you, Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa, but he doesn't put on the gloves. Nevertheless, like his struggling protagonist, Coogler sought to deliver something similar but different with the Oscar-winning franchise. Indeed, 'Creed' does carbon copy a lot of the original 'Rocky' (1976), but the action occurs from the perspective of an African-American. Sophomore helmer Coogler and co-scribe Aaron Covington focus on the late Apollo Creed's illegitimate son, so the film qualifies more as a spin-off. An aspiring pugilist in his own right who since his youth has refused to knuckle under to adversity, Adonis Johnson insists on carving out a name and a reputation for himself without exploiting his father's legacy. Like Rocky, Adonis has boxing in his blood. Unfortunately, despite his undefeated light-heavyweight record of fifteen knock-outs in Mexican boxing matches, our hero cannot recruit a trainer. Predictably, Adonis must surmount similar obstacles to those Rocky faced to arrange a bout with a champ. Along the way, Adonis redeems himself, respects the father that he never knew, and appreciates the mentor who prepares him for the arena—Rocky Balboa.'Creed' opens in 1998, in a Los Angeles County jail, as a wayward youth, Adonis (Alex Henderson of 'Supremacy') is getting beaten up by an older adolescent because his opponent uttered ill words about his late mother. Before the jailers can break-up the brawl, Adonis devastates his enemy. Later, as he is cooling off in a holding cell, Adonis is surprised when Apollo Creed's wife Mary Ann Creed (Phylicia Rashad of 'Good Deeds') persuades him to come home with her. Subsequently, 'Creed' flashes forward to 2015. An older, adult Adonis (Michael B. Jordan of 'Chronicle') knocks out a competitor at a weekend boxing tournament in Tijuana, Mexico. The following day at work, despite having gotten a promotion, Adonis resigns because the job doesn't suit him. He fails to attract a trainer at the Los Angeles-based Delphi Gym where his father got his start. The owner displays nothing but contempt for him. An irate Adonis promises his Mustang to anyone who can deck him, and Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler (newcomer Andre Ward) promptly puts him to sleep. Adonis bids goodbye to Mary Ann, and relocates to Philadelphia, where he approaches Rocky about training him. Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) still runs the same restaurant that he managed in 'Rocky Balboa,' but his wife Adrian and his quarrelsome pal Paulie have both passed away. Initially, Rocky refuses Adonis's offer. Nevertheless, the tenacious Adonis keeps bugging him and eventually persuades the Italian Stallion to teach him. The training montages are both amusing and challenging. Rocky clocks Adonis chasing chickens in a coop to enhance his timing. While he sits in the gym reading the newspaper with his spectacles, Rocky has Adonis skipping rope and shadow boxing. At one point, Rocky changes the gym where they train and Adonis has to follow him on foot while he drives his van across town. The training sequences will make you perspire, but 'Creed' never captures the gritty atmosphere of 'Rocky.' If you remember the original 'Rocky,' our woebegone hero earned spare change as muscle for a small-time Mafioso. Moreover, Rocky groveled under the harsh verbal abuse of a trainer. Comparatively, the college-educated Adonis has squirreled away sufficient funds to survive until his big break.After Adonis has settled into his Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, apartment, he finds it difficult to sleep because a downstairs dweller plays her music loud enough to make the floor thump. Adonis meets Bianca (Tessa Thompson of 'Selma'), and they are attracted to each other. Whereas Rocky and Adrian in 'Rocky' were eking out an existence, Adonis and Bianca are half-way up the ladder. Just as Rocky is transforming Adonis into a top flight contender, the former champ encounters serious medical tribulations that threaten to disrupt their best-laid plans. At the same time, Bianca learns that Adonis has been concealing his heritage from her as Apollo's illegitimate son. The friendship between Rocky and Adonis and their tenacity to survive everything that life hurls at them elevates 'Creed' as an inspirational experience. Of course, the savvy filmmakers draw on our sentiments while Rocky struggles to conquer his medical woes. Naturally, things take an upbeat turn when a pugnacious English pugilist, 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (three time ABA Heavyweight Champion Tony Bellew), challenges Adonis to a fight on HBO. Tony Bellow's 'Pretty Ricky' is reminiscent of Mr. T's Clubber Lang from 'Rocky 3,' and the blood and guts fisticuffs will have you shadow-boxing before the bell sounds.Although he plays second fiddle to Michael B. Jordan's prizefighter, Sylvester Stallone steals the picture with a heartfelt performance. Stallone served as one of the producers of 'Creed,' but 'Creed' doesn't channel the same vibe of Stallone's 'Rocky' movies. The music differs considerably, and the bittersweet experience of another underdog who triumphs isn't entirely alike. Interestingly enough, this distinguishes 'Creed' from the six previous 'Rocky' epics. Coogler stays away from the cute dialogue that Stallone used in his movies. Meantime, the chemistry between the gung-ho Jordan and reluctant Stallone is palatable. They appear as a believable team, and Stallone doesn't have to ham it up to contend with his young co-star. A sizzling romance between Jordan and Tessa Thompson's hearing impaired nightclub warbler gives our hero added dimension. Of course, when everything boils down to the final, big bout, 'Creed' cashes in on the unbeatable 'Rocky' formula. 'Creed' may not clinch any Oscars, though talk has been echoing that Stallone will land a Best Supporting Oscar, but it is contagiously entertaining, not only as a date movie but also as a movie about human beings without CGI special effects. A refreshing change from the usual 'Rocky' antics, 'Creed' pumps fresh blood into old franchise.",9,1,5,20 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Fantastic Fluff!!!
","Seldom does Hollywood produce a comic book prequel as potent and perfect as 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine,' a no-holds-barred barrage of CGI effects, and brawny derring-do that will overwhelm you with its sheer extravagance in less than 120 minutes—actually a trim 107 minutes. 'Tsotsi' director Gavin Hood and savvy scenarists David Benioff of 'Troy' and Skip Woods of 'Swordfish' shove enough testosterone into this larger-than-life spectacle to fuel an entire franchise. After the anemic as well as dismal closure that Brett Ratner's 'X-Men: Last Stand' provided the 'X-Men' trilogy, 'X-Men: Wolverine' brings you back to life like a shot of adrenalin to the heart.Reprising the role that make him a household name, a mutton-chopped Hugh Jackman wields the razor-sharp knuckle knives that he deploys like a Cuisinart in the original 'X-Men' to slash and gash anybody and anything that gets in his way. Like any really good prequel, 'Wolverine' brings the action full-circle so that we learn how Professor Charles Xavier wound up with many of the wards that he supervises in director Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' (2000). Mind you, 'Wolverine' lacks the subtlety that distinguished the first two 'X-Men' movies, but this prequel makes up for it with high-octane, slam-bang, edge-of-your-seat action sequences that make your blood pump.Essentially, 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is a melodrama about two mutants that traces their origins back to Canada's Northwest Territory in the year 1845. As the two half brothers, James Logan (Hugh Jackman of 'Australia') and his older, more unstable semi-sibling Victor Creed (Live Schreiber of 'Scream') flee from their family in Canada and seek refuge in America after Logan kills the man that he believes is his father. Hood and his scribes spend more time probing the back story of the highly conflicted Logan from his turbulent childhood to his tragic romance with a school teacher.Nevertheless, every step of Logan's life entwines with that of his unruly brother who suffers from anger management issues. Yes, eventually, Victor will become known as 'Sabretooth,' but for now he is just Victor. The credit sequence depicts our pugnacious pair--Logan and Victor--displaying their extraordinary strength, nimble dexterity and protean ability to regenerate no matter how devastating their wounds as they wade through the American Civil War, World Wars I and II, and Vietnam. Logan exerts more control over his bestial nature, while Victor wallows in his blood lust for death and violence.In Vietnam, Victor plunges off the deep end. He murders innocent Vietnamese civilians as well as American G.I.s. The Army slaps both Logan and him in front of a firing squad. Of course, these indestructible killing machines cannot die from ordinary bullets. They survive the firing squad's fusillade but find themselves chained up again until General William Stryker (a nefarious Danny Huston of 'The Aviator' at his oiliest) persuades them to be 'part of a special team with special privileges.' (Incidentally, Brian Cox played an older Stryker in 'X-Men 2.') This black-bag, covert operations unit called Team X consists of fellow mutants, including Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds of 'Blade: Trinity'), Agent Zero (Eurasian newcomer Daniel Henney), Wraith (novice Will.i.Am), Fred J. Dukes/The Blob (Kevin Durand of 'Smokin' Aces') and Bradley (Dominic Monaghan of TV's 'Lost') and resembles a mutant 'Magnificent Seven.' For the record, Wade Wilson is a wizard with a sword. Agent Zero handles pistols like a gunman from a John Woo shoot-up with Chow Yun-Fat. For example, after he empties both magazines in his automatic pistols, he drops the clips, sends his sidearms somersaulting into the air like Wild Bill Hickok, snatches two fresh clips from his belt, and jams them into the grips as the guns fall spinning into his fists. Wraith specializes in teleporting. He's somewhere one second and another place a second later. Bradley handles electricity like a conjurer.During a bloodbath of a massacre in Nigeria, Logan quits Team X and masquerades back home in Canada as a ordinary, everyday lumberjack who has settled down with a luscious schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) with has a knack for getting people to do what she wants, including muscle-bound Logan. Meanwhile, Logan wants nothing to do with his angry half-brother, but the bond between Logan and Victor proves to be stronger than even they imagined. Moreover, Victor isn't content to let Logan skip out on him and he sets out to track him down with predictable results that forces Logan to confront his bestial nature on grounds that he cannot control. The treacherous Stryker lures Logan back to his laboratory and convinces him to participate in his highly hush-hush program Weapon X and Logan is reborn as Wolverine with an impenetrable alloy known as adamantium that makes him indestructible. Raving like the usual mad scientist, Stryker informs everybody about how he is going to create an army of these killers, but he forgets that Logan can hear him. Logan succumbs to his beastly nature, transforms into Wolverine, bursts out of the tank, and takes off.Director Gavin Hood attracted praise for his first effort 'Tsotsi,' a formidable drama set in South Africa about a teenage hoodlum who discovered an infant and shields it from the elements. Hood's second movie 'Rendition' with Reese Witherspoon and Jake Gyllenhaal withered, but 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' finds Hood back at the top of his game. Hood stages several incredible as well as outrageous combat sequences between not only Wolverine and Victor but also Wolverine and his other antagonists. The violence is the stuff of far-out fantasy with no relation to anything realistic. Hood manages to juggle multiple characters with ease so that we're never confused about who is trying to smackdown whom. Marvel Comic's purists may quibble about the liberties that Hood and his writers take with the source material, but 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' qualifies as a first-rate, old-fashioned smackdown that will keep you rooting for the hero through thick and thin.",10,8,24,3 May 2009
The Mummy," Rebel With A Gauze!
","Starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, this atmospheric, $80 million special effects extravaganza emerges as a first-rate, old-fashioned, rip-snorting cliffhanger. Director Stephen Sommers' tongue-in-cheek tale of supernatural terror has about as many sheets in the wind as previous 'Mummy' yarns. Although earlier 'Mummies' qualified as little more than the love-sick fantasies of a vindictive Egyptian zombie, this lively incarnation blends elements of Sam Raimi's campy 'Evil Dead' series with Steven Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to yield a high-octane action adventure spectacle. After sitting through this giddy but ghoulish saga, you won't go home and worry about the phantoms under your bed.Writer & director Stephen Sommers' creepy but comic version tops even the straightforward, black & white Boris Karloff original! Of course, the 1932 'Mummy' remains an undisputed classic, with the Technicolor 1959 Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing opus not far behind. Nevertheless, the new 'Mummy' serves as the gauge by which all future 'Mummies' will be measured. This light-hearted but corpse littered chiller captures the period flavor of all of those imperialist British Empire thrillers while it reinvents its infamous rebel with a gauze. Audiences that typically shun fright fests may find its witty, self-depreciating approach here as refreshing as its dazzling state-of-the-art digital foes are dangerous.Sommers sets the stage with an expository seven minute 'Prince of Egypt' like prologue. The ancient city of Thebes appears in all its fabulous splendor in the year 1290 B.C. Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo of 'Hard Target'), Pharaoh's trusted high priest, and the ruler's sexy concubine, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez of 'Mindhunters'), are fooling around when Pharaoh Seti I (Aharon Ipale of 'Son of the Pink Panther') catches them red-handed. Pharaoh covers his scantily clad mistress with tattoos that smear at the least touch so he knows something stinks. Treacherously, Imhotep and Anck Su brandish weapons and assassinate Pharaoh. The gory gutley occurs either off-screen or is shown in warped shadows stretching across the high walls of the temple.Pharaoh's elite bodyguards arrive too late to save their sire. Instead, they watch in horror as Anck Su disembowels herself after proclaiming her freedom from Pharaoh's slavery. Anck Su's logicsuicidal as it seemsis that only Imhotep can bring her back to life with is powerful sorcery, so she distracts the bodyguards while he makes good his escape. Later, Imhotep has all but reincarnated Anck Su when the gung-ho bodyguards turn up in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead, and skewer his skullduggery. Imhotep suffers a fate worse than death. His captors remove his tongue so he cannot scream, wrap him from head to toe in burial linen and lock him up alive in an escape-proof crypt with scores of vicious, cannibalistic scarabs designed to chomp on him for an eternity. According to the prophecy, Imhotep must never arise, least he unleash the ten plagues upon Egypt! The story flashes forward to the year 1923 amid the ruins of Hamunaptra as an outnumbered French Foreign Legion battalion fights an army of tribal horsemen armed with rifles. Meanwhile, from a nearby cliff, the descendents of Pharaoh's bodyguard watch as the desert warriors annihilate the hapless French. Swathed in black robes like Ninjas, with tattoos on their cheeks, they have sworn themselves to guard the crypt of the mummy. Only Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser of 'Gods & Monsters'), a Yankee adventurer in the Legion and a pathetic soldier Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Conner of 'Van Helsing') survive the massacre. Beni hides in a crypt, while Rick flees into the desert. The bodyguards decide not to kill Rick because they believe that the Sahara will finish him off. Miraculously, O'Connell survives and makes his way to Cairo where he winds up in prison with a hangman's noose in his future.Forward the story leaps another couple of years. Sommers introduces us to Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz of 'Eragon'), an attractive but disaster-prone librarian in the Cairo-based Museum of Antiquities. In one of the funniest scenes, Evelyn knocks down a bookcase when she tries to shelve a misplaced tome. This incident triggers a domino effect that topples the rest of the bookcases in a perfect circle around the room. This marvelously staged gag rivals some of Buster Keaton's legendary stunts in his silent movies. Naturally, the curator (Erick Avari of 'Stargate') reprimands Eve, but he cannot fire her because of her late parents' philanthropy for the library. Anyway, Evelyn is a first-class Egyptologist who wants to prove that she is more than just a pretty face. Later, while Evelyn is cleaning up her mess, she stumbles onto her drunken rouge of a brother, Jonathan (John Hannah of 'Sliding Doors'), in a display gallery. He shows her a neat Rubic's cube type box with a treasure map to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals that he stole it from Rick O'Connell who is scheduled to hang on the gallows at Cairo Prison. Evelyn strikes a bargain with the greedy warden (Omid Djalili of 'Mean Machine') and wins Rick's freedom.'Deep Rising' director Stephen Sommers has turned up the heat on what would rate as little more than a pulpy but palatable potboiler. Most 'Mummy' movies are pedestrian, but Sommers' 'Mummy' benefits from the kind of writing that you find in the adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs, H. Rider Haggard, and Rudyard Kipling. 'The Mummy' whirls along at a breakneck pace, bristling with thrills, chills, and frills. The hero is appropriately stalwart, the damsel is naturally gorgeous, and the villain eminently formidable. They embark on a long journey wallpapered with danger and excitement. Let's not forget about those grisly bugs that can crawl under your skin and strip the flesh off you like piranha. The performances are uniformly fun. Arnold Vosloo takes top honors as the moody Imhotep. Although he doesn't deliver much dialogue, Vosloo has enormous screen presence. Happily, he never tries to look anything like Boris Karloff.If you plunge into 'The Mummy' looking for nightmares, prepared to be disappointed.",9,0,0,18 July 2008
Constantine," Keanu Reeves Against Hell
","Anti-tobacco advocates will applaud the action-packed Keanu Reeves supernatural saga 'Constantine' (*** out of ****) for the way that rookie director Francis Lawrence seamlessly integrates a public service message about the horrors of nicotine into his otherworldly, special effects-laden, metaphysical melodrama. Simultaneously, comparisons between Reeves' 'Matrix' trilogy and 'Constantine' are inevitable. First, like 'The Matrix,' an unseen world exists in 'Constantine' that nobody knows about except those that battle audacious demons in an eternal war between Heaven and Hell. Second, just as the heroes transported themselves through telephone wires into the hidden world of 'The Matrix,' the protagonists in 'Constantine' follow a similar procedure. Basically, they immerse themselves either partially or wholly in water, so they can cross over into the fiery netherworld. Mind you, 'Constantine' diverges enough from 'The Matrix,' so that you cannot truthfully call it a 'Matrix' knockoff. Although this grim but entertaining Warner Brothers release concerns subject matter similar to that in 'The Exorcist,' 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'Spawn,' and the 'Prophecy' and 'The Crow' movies, 'Constantine' manages to carve out a niche all its own. Swiftly-paced, gorgeously photographed by Oscar-winning lenser Philippe Rousselot, with an anti-social, chain-smoking, lung cancer-afflicted hero; a pretty sympathetic heroine, and several intriguing (or perhaps blasphemous) twists on Catholic theology, 'Constantine' provides enough thrills, chills, and cheeky humor to make it worth watching more than once.As John Constantine, Keanu Reeves plays a natty 'Men-In-Black' type enforcer who acts as an exorcist of sorts in a perpetual war against evil on Earth. In an early scene, Constantine banishes a skeleton-like demon with half of a skull from the body of a young Hispanic girl. The exorcism doesn't go as easily as Constantine had anticipated, so he appropriates a 300 pound mirror to trap the fiend in and send it to a shattering death. Afterward, Constantine gets the feeling that something just ain't right. Demons have never behaved this rebelliously and Constantine is worried. According to the script by Kevin ('The Glimmer Man') Brodbin and Frank ('Suburban Commando') Cappello, angels and demons can influence humans, but they cannot intervene in their everyday affairs. Unlike most humans who have doubts about Hell, Constantine has no doubts. Born with an uncanny curse to recognize demons on buses as well as anywhere else, young Constantine tried to take his life, but the doctors managed to save him. Nevertheless, during the two minutes that he lay clinically death, our hero toured Hell and saw enough demons to commit him to his current course of action. Constantine serves as a sort of INS agent who--as he says in one scene--'deports' demons back to Hell. Since he committed suicide, Constantine hopes that his reputation as the toughest demon buster in Los Angeles will earn him grace in God's eyes and a place in Heaven. The angel Gabriel (played by 'The Beach's' Tilda Swinton as an androgynous entity with wings) doesn't think that Constantine stands a chance in Hell of entering Heaven.Meanwhile, L.A.P.D. Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz of 'Chain Reaction') is grieving over the apparent suicide death of her twin sister Isabel. Isabel (Weisz in a dual role) who took a header off the top-floor of the clinic where she was being hospitalized and plunged to her death. Despite her best efforts, Angela cannot get the Catholic Church to give her sister a proper send-off. When she sees the surveillance camera footage of Isabel's suicide, Angela hears her sister utter Constantine's name. Eventually, Constantine and Angela team up to take on hordes of dastardly demons. While this occurs, a homeless Hispanic dude has unearthed the Spear of Destiny, the same spear that a Roman soldier jabbed into Christ's side at Golgotha, which he finds wrapped in a Nazi flag in Mexico. This invincible spear-carrier sets out for Los Angeles, and nothing can stop him! Seems like there is a second-coming at hand. But it has nothing to do with Heaven. That's just for starters!Although the Brodbin & Cappello script has some flaws in its logic, 'Constantine' is still an exciting, high-octane, summer-time, occult actioneer. Brodbin and Cappello do a good job of laying out the ground rules for dispatching the demons, but it appears as if some of the plot hit the cutting room floor in this two-hour plus, R-rated epic. Nobody has time for sex in this gritty, dark-edged, demon-infested nail-biter. Although it contains horrific elements, 'Constantine' doesn't qualify as a chiller. This movie won't give you Technicolor nightmares unless you smoke cigarettes like a chimney. Purists who have read the DC/Vertigo comic 'Hellblazer,' which served as the basis for 'Constantine,' may complain because the protagonist was a profane Englishman. Word is that they Anglicized the hero, because Keanu didn't want to fool around with an accent. As hard-boiled as this tale is, the filmmakers supply more than enough humor to off-set some of its more unsavory subject matter. At one point, Constantine traps a spider under a glass, blows cigarette smoke into the glass, and settles back to watch the arachnid with the comment: 'Welcome to my world.' No sooner has our hero said this than another character frees the spider from its glassy prison. Interestingly enough, 'Constantine' isn't the first movie where a Keanu Reeves character has gone to Hell. Does anybody remember 'Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey?' Further, 'Constantine' isn't the first movie where Keanu has met the devil. Anybody remember 'The Devil's Advocate?' Constantine' also represents a reunion for Weisz and Reeves who co-starred in 'Chain Reaction.' Finally, if you do see 'Constantine,' stick around after the end credits for one more scene that ties up a loose thread in the plot.",8,2,9,3 March 2005
Troy," 'Troy' Is A Joy!!!
","'Das Boot' director Wolfgang Petersen shuns the gods in 'Troy' but doesn't suffer the consequences. This impressive adaptation of Homer's spear-and-sandal classic 'The Iliad,' about the legendary siege of the eponymous city and the hard-bodied combatants, who clashed swords, conjures up not only spectacle on a sprawling scale but also delivers charisma on an even grander scale. Traditionally, when we think about the Trojan War, we think about the adulterous Helen, who started it all when she cuckolded husband Menelaus and skipped Sparta with youthful Paris. After all, Helen's claim to fame rests on her comely features that reportedly launched a thousand ships. On the other hand, this revisionist, 21st century rendition spends more time admiring the abs of its heroes rather than the eyes of its anorectic heroines. Consequently, 'Troy' ogles Achilles more often than Helen, and for good reason, too. Not since John Travolta buffed up for Sylvester Stallone's abysmal 'Staying Alive' (1983) has an actor so conscientiously dedicated himself to a muscular makeover. Reportedly, Pitt spent six months building up his body. Ironically, he pulled his Achilles tendon during the production. Meanwhile, the producers make sure Brad bares his body early and often to display his magnificently sculptured biceps and six-pack. This is not Brad Pitt as we are accustomed to seeing him. He has a signature lunge as Achilles when he delivers the death blow with his sword that he repeats at intervals against his opponents that is visually striking..Meanwhile, Petersen and scenarist David Benioff omits scenes of the Greek deities who would have divulged too much and ruined the suspense and tension in this mortals-only account of events. A blond, bluffed-up Brad Pitt portrays Achilles as a pugnacious prima Donna. He thumbs his nose at Agamemnon and lives for the moment in combat when he can attain his dream of immortality. Compelling plotting and memorable dialogue bolsters this lengthy, but satisfying 162-minute, epic rehash of history's most celebrated ancient war. Nevertheless, despite its marathon length, skillful storytelling, and its secular, down-to-earth, reimagination of Homer, 'Troy' has more going for it than the sum of its shortcomings. An impressive cast, including screen veterans Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox, Nigel Phelp's astonishing production values, the seamless integration of computer-generated effects with live action footage and several superbly staged combat sequences that have no equal in ancient actioneers offset whatever flaws in this $175-million plus, English language extravaganza.The larger-than-life action opens in 1200 B.C. King Agamemnon (Brian Cox of 'The Glimmer Man') leads his army out to confront Triopas (Julian Glover of 'For Your Eyes Only') on the field of battle. Agamemnon is an avaricious, warmongering opportunist. Triopas suggests Agamemnon and he avoid needless bloodshed by pitting the best of their best against each other. This amusing prologue shows the womanizing Achilles as the greatest warrior of his day, a 'Rambo' of antiquity, who can whip any adversary. In his first, on-screen scrap, Achilles takes down an imposing Goliath-like opponent who makes our protagonist appear puny by comparison. Size counts for little, because the smaller Achilles displays his agility in slaying his adversary with a single blow! 'Perfect Storm' director Petersen choreographs the action sequences with considerable flair and imagination, thanks in part to veteran James Bond stuntman Simon Crane.The hand-to-hand combat appears not only believable, but also the actors wield their swords, shields, and spears with credible ferocity. Later battles qualify as more than just aimless mob warfare with splendidly clad extras roughhousing it with their counterparts. Watch the way Achilles and his mercenaries cover themselves with their shields to repulse wave after wave of arrows. The participants wield their armor with as much savvy as their swords and spears. Meantime, the dialogue scenes that intersperse the gritty action are just as memorable. The theme of immortality pervades this fine example of an ancient world epic. Ultimately, anytime Hollywood handles ancient history, the dialogue possesses an ersatz quality, but the lines here are insightful.Indeed, Homer's classic 'The Illiad' inspired this illicit romance that prompted this war. Anybody who survived the 1960s should remember the classic Greek sagas such as 'Jason and the Argonauts' (1963) and 'Clash of the Titans' (1981). Every action on Earth generated corresponding action in the realm of the gods with Zeus lording it over his supernatural peers. 'Troy' ignores the gods but doesn't rank as a lesser effort for this neglect, though one can imagine how many more millions of dollars and minutes of time inclusion of the gods might have required. Generally, scenes with the gods serve to clarify terrestrial conflicts and clue us in on what we might have missed on Earth.One of the shortcomings lies in the source material and its lack of explanation. For example, audiences not familiar with Trojan mythology might have a difficult time understanding why an arrow through Achilles' ankle would prove so fatal. Petersen and Benioff scale down the action to mortals-only, and 'Troy' looks as close to what could have happened if it happened. The beachhead landing (lensed in Mexico) emerges as the ancient equivalent of the sixth of June, D-Day landings in Normandy in World War II, with an armada of oar-driven ships crowding the sea from horizon to horizon. You finally get to see the famous Trojan horse in the final 45 minutes. Ace lenser Roger Pratt gives 'Troy' a big-screen magnitude with his awesome long shots of virtually anything beyond arm's reach. When the opposing armies march against each other on the level lands in front of Troy, the spectacle is breathtaking in its scale.Although Petersen and Benioff have tampered with the venerable plot, the action is worth-watching from fade-in to fade-out. Achilles emerges as more of a villain, but Hector (Eric Bana of 'Hulk') looks like a wrongly slain hero. Paris and Helen emerge as the least effectual lovers in a long time. Naturally, Orlando Bloom wields a bow and arrow. Altogether, 'Troy' ranks as a joy to watch!",9,2,6,8 July 2009
Just Go with It," Just Grin At It!
","Adam Sandler is really getting mellow in his forties. 'Happy Gilmore' director Dennis Dugan's 'Just Go With It' qualifies as an uneven, predictable, but entertaining farce for the former 'Saturday Night Live' comedian. Sandler looks like he had a blast as a smart aleck Jewish plastic surgeon who masquerades as a hen-pecked husband so he can bed down with beautiful babes. No Sandler comedy would be complete without his distinctive brand of infantile humor. 'Just Go With It' boasts its share of absurdly ludicrous moments. The best example depicts Sandler's co-star Nick Swardson of 'Reno 911!' as he performs the Heimlich maneuver on an obviously artificial sheep that has swallowed a rubber toy. Surprisingly enough, this lightweight, PG-13 rated, romantic comedy spends most of its 117 minutes being cute and endearing rather than toxic and offensive. Mind you, Sandler and company ridicule the generation gap, gays, marriage, plastic surgery, bowel movements, erectile dysfunction, and mendacity. What ultimately sets 'Just Go With It' apart from the usual Sandler shenanigans is the presence of upscale co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman. Kidman has never been such a clown. Together they prove that a woman doesn't have to be a twenty-something nymph, like drop-dead gorgeous swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker, to bound around in a bikini. Although Dugan and scenarists Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling have essentially remade the 1969 Walter Matthau comedy 'Cactus Flower,' 'Just Go With It' resembles the classic Blake Edwards comedy '10' with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek. In '10' (1979), a middle-aged man pursued a twenty year old babe before he realized that their age gap made them incompatible. Dugan lenses the graceful Decker in slow-motion as she jogs through the surf. These moments are comparable to painter Sandro Botticelli's picture of Venus on a Half-Shell. 'Just Go With It' opens with a 1980's prologue. Cardiologist Dr. Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler of 'The Water Boy') is about to get married. Danny has a hilariously large nose that rivals the prominent proboscis of Cyrano de Bergerac. While Danny is biding his time for marriage, he learns that his fiancée not only has been cheating on him throughout their courtship but she also plans to cheat on him after they exchange nuptials. Worse, she isn't marrying Danny for love but for his money. Our heartbroken hero ditches her and becomes a successful plastic surgeon. In the original, the lead in 'Cactus Flower' was a dentist. Initially, Danny goes to a meat market bar to drown his grief in alcohol. He helps a lady who is being harassed by the local lotharios. At first, she believes Danny he is just another wolf until she spots his wedding ring. Sadly, he reveals his plight. He lies that he is the victim of an unhappy marriage. The lady takes pity on him and takes him home for a one-night stand. Danny relies on this cynical strategy to keep himself knee deep in commitment-free dames. Eventually, a lady comes along who changes Danny's mind. A gorgeous sixth-grade math teacher, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker in her film debut), proves to be more of a distraction than a hormonally addled teenage boy can handle. The kid cuts up his knee when he looks at Palmer rather than his destination. Danny doctors him up and gets together with Palmer. They spend the night on the beach. The next morning Palmer finds a wedding ring in Danny's pants and refuses to have anything to do with him. She doesn't date married men. Danny pursues Palmer but gets nowhere. He tries to explain that he isn't married. Since he has no way of convincing her that he is a bachelor, our desperate hero decides to lie. Danny tells Palmer that he is getting a divorce. This tactic changes everything for the better, and Palmer is prepared to resume their romance. However, she makes one condition. Danny must introduce her to his soon-to-be ex-wife. Danny throws himself on the mercy his comely office manager Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston of 'The Bounty Hunter') and persuades her to act as his ex-wife. As it turns out, Katherine is a divorced single parent with two kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck), and is literally Danny's closest friend. Everything goes smoothly when Palmer meets Katherine. As Katherine is about to depart, she receives a cell phone call about her children Maggie and Michael. Palmer changes her rules. She demands that Danny introduce her to Maggie and Michael. Danny has to bribe Katherine's kids to pretend that they are his offspring. Maggie aspires to be an actress and sells out for acting lessons, while Michael holds out for a Hawaiian vacation so he can swim with dolphins. Danny takes them to Hawaii along with his cousin, Eddie (wacky Nick Swardson), who masquerades as an Austrian sheep salesman. While in Hawaii, Katherine runs into her old friend Devlin (Nicole Kidman of 'Eyes Wide Shut') and Danny and Katherine have to act like they are really married. The complications that occur threaten to drive Palmer and Danny apart, but the surprise ending isn't really surprising.The humor is low-brow but funny. The goofy plastic surgery sight gags generate lots of laughs. The lady with the arched eyebrow is a hoot! The remainder of 'Just Go With It' turns into an evasive, door-slamming farce with Danny doing his best to fool Palmer. The rivalry between Aniston and Kidman to see who is a better dancer, particularly in the scene where their significant others must dance body against body to move a coconut from their hips to their lips without their hands is amusing. Along the way, our hero learns a few lessons about love and commitment that neither we nor he would typically see in an Adam Sandler comedy. You will grin more than you will grimace at 'Just Go With It.'",8,7,12,14 February 2011
Orphan," Adopting the Spawn of Satan . . . Very Good Chiller
","You cannot say a lot about 'Orphan' without spoiling the ending.This 'Bad Seed' melodrama about a cute little girl who qualifies as a couple's worst nightmare lives up to its R-rating with murder either by knife or pillow. Of course, the language is profane and offensive more than a couple of times.Spanish-born American film director Jaume Collet-Serra makes up for his uninspired 2005 remake of 'House of Wax' with 'Orphan,' an articulate mystery thriller with a shrewdly written screenplay by newcomer David Johnson based on an Alex Mace story. Nothing that Collet-Serra and his scenarists do can prepare you for the last quarter-hour revelation that not only spins 'Orphan' on its head but will also spin your head on its axis. Indeed, 'Orphan' opens like a formulaic chiller about the mistakes that come with adopting children, especially if the adolescent is the spawn of Satan.A young, upscale married couple that should have been content with a boy and a hearing impaired daughter decide to compensate for the tragic death of their third child (he died stillborn) and adopt a needy child. The wife just wants to spread the love that she had for their third child. They adopt a 9-year old Russian girl and the rest of their life becomes a nightmare. 'Orphan' relies on anti-Eastern European prejudices. The idea that an American couple might adopt a Russian child sounds rather liberal, but she winds up being an albatross around their necks.Peter Sargaard and Vera Farmiga make a convincing couple who have seen the downside of life while Isabela Furhman of 'Hounddog' is chilling as the villainess. Collet-Serra does an excellent job of building up the suspense and tension after the couple adopts the girl and brings her home. The filmmakers slip in bits and pieces that make sense only after you've seen the film. The ending, again, is a shocker!",9,2,4,3 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Slam Bang Actioneer with Christian Bale As John Connor
","The fourth entry in the 'Terminator' franchise 'Terminator Salvation' doesn't topline Arnold Schwarzenegger. The legendary Austrian bodybuilder appears strictly as a CGI character in a cameo as he looked in James Cameron's original 'Terminator,' and he doesn't utter any of his signature lines of dialogue. Despite the absence of Arnold, this superbly produced epic qualifies as excellent in every respect, and McG stages everything with the word spectacular in mind. Skynet deploys its devastating Hunter-Killer helicopters that possess vertical engines like a Harrier Jump Jet. The T-101 terminators appear by the scores, and Skynet has a gigantic exoskeleton robot with a mini-Vulcan cannon mounted atop its towering physique. Furthermore, they have water creatures that resemble spines with pincers for mouths. The Resistance counters these forces with A-10 attack jets, and they maintain their headquarters aboard a submarine at sea so as to elude detection by Skynet. This larger-than-life tale initially transpires in the wastelands and then the action moves to Skynet headquarters. Iconically , one of the important things that this movie does is show us how Connor acquired his distinctive facial scar. Christian Bale takes over the role of John Connor, the chief Resistance leader, in McG's sci-fi action adventure fantasy that takes place during the war between Mankind and Machines after Judgment Day. Skynet is headquartered in San Francisco, and a former convicted murderer, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington of 'Avatar'), plays an important role in this installment. Wright decides to donate his body to science after he is executed; Dr. Serena Kogan (Helen Bonham Carter of 'Fight Club') persuaded Wright to make his final contribution and they converted him to being a machine. Later, he learns that he was designed to infiltrate the resistance and locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and Marcus succeeds in his mission. Unfortunately, Marcus and Kyle are separated during a Skynet attack. During an aerial attack with Skynet hunter-killer helicopters, a pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood of 'Falling Skies'), stumbles onto Marcus after she survives a plane crash. When they plunge into a minefield on the way to Blair's resistance base, Marcus trips a mine and winds up in captivity. Marcus convinces Connor that he didn't know that he was a Terminator. Meantime, the Resistance is poised to bomb Skynet, and Connor struggles to convince General Ashdown (Michael Ironsides of 'Starship Troopers') that he cannot destroy the Skynet camp without killing Reese. Ashdown doesn't seem to know how vital Kyle's life is to the Resistance. Connor disobeys Ashdown launches a one-man assault on Skynet with Marcus' help. Marcus ends up saving Connor during a fracas with a Terminator.'Terminator Salvation' contemplates what distinguishes mankind from machines. At the end, Skynet's global network remains intact, but the Resistance has won a victory. Christian Bale is good as John Connor, and Sam Worthington rivals him as Marcus Wright, a Terminator who retains enough vestiges of his humanity to triumph over the machine makeover that Skynet has performed on him. 'Terminator Salvation' is memorable for many reasons. First, we see Skynet's vast new arsenal of weapons. Second, we get a macro sense of the overall command structure of the Resistance.",9,4,6,4 July 2015
Insomnia," Mediocre Murder Mystery Set in Alaska
","You won't lose any sleep over 'Insomnia,' the melancholic Al Pacino & Robin Williams psychological murder-mystery. Acclaimed director Christopher Nolan of 'Memento' (2000), has remade an outstanding 1977 Norwegian thriller, but turned it into a ponderous, profane (39 f-words), predictable, police procedural potboiler. Although Pacino and Williams usually deliver flawless performances, they act as if were suffering from insomnia rather than their characters. Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank of 'Boys Don't Cry' (1999) lurks on the periphery of this lugubrious cat & mouse melodrama like a naïve Nancy Drew, while Maura Tierney of 'Instinct' fares no better in a lackluster supporting role as an innkeeper who sleeps with Pacino so 'Insomnia' will have an obligatory one-night stand. Despite its mediocre, convoluted plot, 'Insomnia' generates only a modicum of excitement during a couple of nail-biting interludes, but neither salvages this muddled morality play about redemption.Los Angeles Police Department Detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino of 'Any Given Sunday') and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan, who played an FBI Agent in 'Malcolm X') fly up to Nightmute, Alaska, to help local authorities solve the homicide of 17-year-old Kay Connell (Crystal Lowe) with her boyfriend, Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) as the chief suspect. Actually, the real reason Dormer and Eckhart get packed off to the frozen north is to get out of Los Angeles while Internal Affairs reviews allegations of police corruption involving them. Dormer is a highly decorated, career cop accused of planting evidence to obtain convictions, and his younger partner Eckhart reveals that he has cut a deal with Internal Affairs. Immediately, Dormer fears Eckhart's testimony may reverse many of Dormer's cases and incriminate him. Meanwhile, rookie Alaskan cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) admires Dormer as a model cop and eagerly looks forward to working with him.No sooner has Dormer arrived that he has difficulty getting to sleep. An implacable sun shines twenty-four hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, and Dormer cannot catch enough shut-eye. In L.A., Internal Affairs suspects that Dormer killed. Nightmute Police Chief Charles Nyback (Paul Dooley of 'Runaway Bride') assigns Ellie to investigate the shooting, while Dormer grilles the dead girls' classmates. Nevertheless, the accidental killing flushes out the real killer. He knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and he threatens to blackmail Dormer if the celebrated detective doesn't help him frame the dead girl's unsavory boyfriend. As for the murder investigation, Dormer observes that the killer went to a great deal of trouble to clean up the dead girl's corpse so as to eliminate any traces of DNA.For example, Dormer points out that the girl's fingernails have been trimmed. (If you're keeping track, Italian director Dario Argento used a similar ploy in his considerably more exciting 2001 whodunit 'Sleepless.' Anyway, the predictable plot thickens with Dormer and the police stake out an isolated cabin where the cops found the victim's back-pack. When a suspect shows up to take the bait, one of the clumsy Nightmute cops alerts him by keying his megaphone. During an erratic chase through blinding fog, Dormer guns down his partner accidentally, but he claims that the suspect did it. Dormer agrees to schedule a meeting with him on a river ferry.Director Christopher Nolan and freshman scenarist Hillary Seitz wait about an hour before they introduce mystery novelist Walter Finch (Robin Williams in the most muted performance of his career) as a suspect. Finch knew the dead girl, Kay Connell, well, because she visited him regularly and they have many conversations about literature. Meanwhile, Noland spends most of 'Insomnia' dealing with Dormer's guilty conscience. Either Nightmute, Alaska, boasts no pharmacies or Dormer is too macho to gobble sleeping pills. Probably the best scene in this dreary detective yarn occurs when Dormer chases the suspect across a log flume. The elusive suspect leaps from one fast-flowing log to the next with nimble agility, but Dormer lacks his balance and timing. Dormer loses his footing, narrowly escapes getting his head crushed by the logs when he falls between them and winds up trapped underwater, struggling to hold his breath until a gap appears in the logs.. Sadly, nothing else proves as invigorating as this scene. Incredibly, before long even the sleepless Dormer begins to suspect that he has deliberately bumped off his partner. Long before 'Insomnia' wears off, you'll know that you make a mistake if you wind up watching this wretched whodunit, too.",4,2,4,21 March 2009
Juno," Top-Notch Comedy About High School Pregnancy
","'Thank You For Smoking' director Jason Reitman's second feature-length motion picture comedy 'Juno' is nothing short of excellent. This irreverent take on the travails that a high school junior, Juno (Ellen Page), must endure after she gets pregnant with her boyfriend when they experiment with sexual relations for the first time is memorable, witty, and filled with believable characters. Initially, Juno contemplates an abortion until one of her classmates points out that the little one inside her already has fingernails. Juno and her gal pal pick up a small newspaper and find a childless couple who are dying to adopt and Juno signs an agreement to hand over her baby after delivery.

Concussion," 'Concussion' Fumbles An Important Message
","Will Smith delivers an Oscar worthy performance as crusading pathologist Dr. Dr. Bennet Omalu in 'Parkland' writer & director Peter Landesman's 'Concussion,' a mediocre but true-life medical expose about the perils of playing professional football. Although the timely subject matter about brain-damaged NFL players is definitely the stuff of which concussions are made, the straightforward saga lacks the devastating impact of its message. When you consider what the NFL has gotten away with in its greed, you'd think 'Concussion' would have conjured up more clout. Little of what happens in 'Concussion' is remotely compelling. Occasionally, 'Concussion' conjures up suspense. Were it not for Smith's subdued presence, this anti-pigskin parade would never played movie theaters and quietly have passed away on home video. Landesman surrounds Smith with an impeccable cast, including Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, David Morse, Richard T. Jones, Eddie Marsan, and Arliss Howard. Landesman did a good job with his JFK thriller 'Parkland,' but he drops the ball completely here.",5,16,27,29 December 2015
Deadpool 2," The Best 'Deadpool' Yet!!!
","Not only must good sequels live up to the original, but they must also transcend it. 'Atomic Blonde' director David Leitch's 'Deadpool 2' makes Tim Miller's 'Deadpool' appear almost prudish, boasting thrice as much profanity, promiscuity, and pyrotechnics, including our protagonist's smart-aleck asides to the audience. You've got to be a little warped yourself to appreciate Deadpool's antics. Make no mistake, 'Deadpool' started the next stride in the evolution of cinematic costume-clad crimefighters. Starting with several 'X-Men' (2000) epics, sequels and prequels, 'Spider-Man' (2002) sequels and reboots, 'The Fantastic Four' (2005) and its sequel 'The Rise of the Silver Surfer,' and then 'Iron Man' (2008), 'The Incredible Hulk' (2008), 'Thor' (2011), 'Captain America' (2011), 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014), 'Ant Man' (2015), 'Doctor Strange' (2016), and 'Black Panther' (2017), the Marvel Cinematic Universe has outperformed its venerable rivals in the DC Universe, spouting risqué humor with PG-13 restraint, engaging characters, all swirled with sensational CGI. Although 'Deadpool' (2016) never takes himself seriously, Ryan Reynolds is seriously sidesplitting. Skewering everything and everybody as well as himself and the eponymous character, Ryan Reynolds qualifies as the perfect match with 'the merc with a mouth.' Shattering the status quo PG-13 barrier, 'Deadpool' plunged gleefully into forbidden R-rated territory. Earlier, no Hollywood studio would have green-lighted such an unconventional movie. Nothing in the 'Deadpool' universe is safe from our crimson clad crimefighter's subversive sense of humor. If 'Deadpool' ranked as the first exception to the rule, Hugh Jackman's, R-rated, swan-song 'Logan' (2017) confirmed superheroes could thrive in an R-rated universe. 'Deadpool 2' delivers every dollar's worth of its $110-million budget in energetic stunts, a James Bond opening credits parody, and a stouthearted Marvel character co-star who never lets Deadpool overshadow him. A minute under of two hours, 'Deadpool 2' provides everything Reynolds promised during his after-credits 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' scene in the original. 'Deadpool 2' begins with Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds of 'Green Lantern'), aka 'Deadpool,' struggling to keep his gal, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin of 'Serenity'), out of harm's way. Unfortunately, he cannot protect her when gunmen invade their apartment, and Vanessa dies from a fatal bullet! Tragedy strikes early in this rambunctious sequel, and Vanessa remains on 'the other side' for most of it! A grief-stricken Deadpool catches her killer, disposing of him painfully as only Deadpool can, and then he obliterates himself in a fireball inferno. As all Deadpool fans know, Deadpool is indestructible as long as he has his superpowers. Mind you, he cannot kill himself, courtesy of Ajax's cancer treatments inflicted on him in 'Deadpool.' Incredibly, Deadpool's body rejuvenates itself! During a momentary absence, Wade visits Vanessa in 'the other world.' Initially, Vanessa had wanted to have a baby, but a bullet destroyed those dreams. Now, Wade Williams/Deadpool vows to save a child. This child is an obese teen with an attitude, Russell Collins (Julian Dennison of 'Shopping'), who has suffered grievously at the hands of workers in an orphanage. Russell can summon flamethrower fires from his blazing hands, and he vows to incinerate the perverted Headmaster. A sympathetic Deadpool befriends Russell, but the two land in 'the Icebox' Prison, where our hero loses his superpowers. He advises Russell to find somebody else. No sooner are they behind bars than a vengeful Cable (Josh Brolin of 'Sicario') appears. Cable storms the mutant prison located in an isolated snow-covered mountain range. An indomitable half-man, half-cyborg, equipped with massive firepower, he blasts away at Russell. A flashforward reveals Russell cremated Cable's wife and daughter, after the teen had grown up. Cable plans to liquidate him before Russell grows old enough to harm his loved ones. However, Cable must bypass Deadpool, but Deadpool refuses to accommodate him. Not only does grim-looking Cable resemble the Terminator, but he is also every bit as alarming. Deadpool compares him with 'the Winter Soldier.' A straight-forward, time-traveling titan on a personal vendetta, Cable has no tolerance for humor. Cable makes the perfect straight man, and the granite-jawed Brolin looks born to play the character. He disparages Deadpool as 'an annoying clown dressed up as a sex toy.' Cable looks nothing like Thanos. Another Marvel character who hasn't been seen since 'X-Men: The Last Stand' appears in one of the more dynamic action scenes. After Deadpool abandons Russell, Russell forges a friendship with Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a muscle-bound behemoth who wears a lampshade helmet. Inevitably, Colossus and Juggernaut tangle, in a reprise of Colossus's clash with Angel Dust (Gina Carano) in the original. Deadpool resolves to thwart Cable and rescue Russell during an armored prison convoy transfer. Assembling team 'X-Force,' a bunch of mutant half-wits, he uses them to hijack the convoy. Their mission is doomed from the start, and Deadpool must contend with trigger-happy Cable as well as the barbarous Juggernaut. Amidst all this turmoil, Russell's chief adversary, the despicable Headmaster (Eddie Marsan of 'The World's End'), makes an unforgettable impression despite the modicum of time allowed him. 
'Atomic Blonde' director David Leitch sets several exhilarating, over-the-top, acrobatic faceoffs to venerable Top-40 hit tunes. The action erupts with Deadpool's world tour where he assails crime families everywhere and racks up a double-digit body count. Indeed, 'Deadpool 2' bristles with more scenes of simulated cinematic violence than its predecessor. Leitch's polished directorial flare; the top-drawer CGI effects; and Ryan Reynolds' nonstop humor distinguish this superior sequel. The scene where Deadpool shoots Ryan Reynolds as he reads the 'Green Lantern' screenplay is riotous. Not as atrocious as Reynolds argues, 'Green Lantern' went belly-up at the box-office, and he maintains his contempt for it here as he did in 'Deadpool.' 'Deadpool' scenarists Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, along with Reynolds, make nothing easy for our protagonist. He suffers several setbacks. The Brad Pitt cameo highlights the hilarious 'X-Force' debacle as well as the X-Men that Wade overlooks at the mansion. Altogether, 'Deadpool 2' is far more entertaining and uproarious than 'Deadpool,' and the writers create greater depth and spontaneity in this follow-up.",10,1,2,13 June 2018
X-Men," 'X-Men' is X-cellent!
","'X-Men' rules! As directed by 'The Usual Suspects' helmer Bryan Singer, this top-drawer cinematic adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics series sets a whole new standard for filming superhero sagas. Unlike the gratuitously overblown but happily-ever-after DC Comics characters, 'X-Men' differs because Marvel Comics forged superheroes with tragic flaws. Not only does Singer orchestrate an entertaining but intelligent yarn around titans of Good and Evil battling for supremacy with the fate of mankind at stake, but he also tackles important cultural issues integral to the plot that enhance its subtext about intolerance. Ultimately, 'X-Men' qualifies as the best superhero comic book movie ever produced, thanks to a stellar cast led by Shakespearean heavyweights Patrick 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' Stewart and Sir Ian 'Richard III' McKellen, 'Matrix' style special effects which compliment rather than eclipse the plot, and a literate script that parries childish pratfalls. Obviously, hardcore aficionados of either the animated TV series (1992-98) or the comic book itself may complain about the various liberties that Singer and scenarist David Hayter take with the subject matter.Over the opening credits, Patrick Stewart narrates that 'in the not too distant future' genetic mutations will trigger the 'next stage of evolution.' As the next evolutionary stage of life, mutants—a.k.a. Homo superiors—will suffer persecution because they are not only different but also potentially dangerous. The prejudice that mankind manifests toward these mutants serves as an allegory for our current climate of political, racial, and sexual bigotry as well as the uncertainty that older teenagers and younger twentysomethings encounter as they search for their niche in society. Some critics have compared the showdown between Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) with the rivalry between Martin Luther King and Malcolm X during the turbulent 1960s, while others have recognized mutants as symbols for any oppressed group forced to identify themselves, whether they be classified as homosexuals, communists, Jewish, or firearms owners. Like the famous 'Star Wars' prologue, Stewart's voice-over neatly encapsulates the origins of the 'X-Men' and the inherent conflicts confronting them.While 'Superman' and 'Batman' unfolded in linear fashion, starting from the beginning, Singer picks up 'X-Men' somewhere in the middle. The setting is Poland in 1944, and the Nazis are parading helpless Jews into the gas chambers for extermination. When young Erik Lensherr (Brett Morris, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the older Ian McKellen) finds himself separated from his parents as the Nazis are about to gas them, he experiences such heretofore unknown terror that he emanates an invisible force field with his fingertips. He destroys the high, iron, barb-wired gates while several soldiers struggle to restrain him. Finally, smashing Lensherr in the face with his rifle butt, one Nazi sentry knocks him unconscious. Nevertheless, his supernatural powers stun the guards. This grim scene in Auschwitz hearkens back to 'Schindler's List (1193), while the show of paranormal power recalls Brian De Palma's 'Carrie.' As introductions go, the concentration camp scene grips with its poignancy. Clearly, this horrific, downbeat scene is not the usual way to kick off a superficial movie about a comic book franchise.Flash-forwarding through time, Singer brings us to contemporary Washington, D.C. Dr. Jean Gray ('GoldenEye's statuesque Famke Janssen), a telepathic mutant with telekinetic powers, address Congress on the controversial subject of mutant registration. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davidson of 'Willard') believes mutants with their extraordinary physical and mental prowess endanger humanity. The fanatical Kelly demands all mutants be required to identify themselves. Moreover, he campaigns for registering them since they cannot be trusted to supervise their powers responsibly. Some mutants, he argues, can eavesdrop on your mind and read your thoughts. While Kelly drums up support for his proposed legislation, Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) watches quietly from the balcony. Although confined to a wheelchair, Xavier is a super-telepath that can do what Kelly fears the most. Not only can Xavier read your innermost thoughts, but he also can exert control of another person's body and speak through them with the ease of a ventriloquist.Unlike the cynical Erik Lensherr, a.k.a. Magneto, who insists war between humans and mutants is inevitable, Xavier contends that mutants and humans can co-exist in harmony. As far as Xavier is concerned, people like Kelly are well-meaning but misinformed. Xavier has established a School for Gifted Youth in Westchester, New York, where he teaches young mutants to curb their potentially destructive urges. Some of his long-time students, Cyclops (James Marsden of '27 Dresses') who sports special sunglasses to shield his lethal laser beam eyes; Storm (Halle Berry of 'Die Another Day') who controls weather and deploys lightning bots; and Dr. Jean Grey serve as instructors when they aren't running errands for Xavier. Concisely, in a model of economy, Singer establishes the characters and creates the overall conflict between them while broaching questions about the enormity of segregation! Moreover, he inserts several amusing tidbits of humor that flesh out the characters without detracting from the storyline.The conflict in David Hayter's screenplay that prompts Magneto and Xavier to clash again concerns tow mutants thrown together by fate. A teenage girl in Meridian, Mississippi, Marie (Anna Paquin of 'The Piano') discovers her touch can kill. Also known as 'Rogue,' she can drain the life out of people. Horrified by her inexplicable power, she hits the road and eventually meets Logan (Hugh Jackman), a rough-hewn cage fighter nicknamed 'Wolverine,' an anti-social amnesia-stricken loner searching for his past.Director Bryan Singer toils throughout 'X-Men' to dispel any notions that it is just another disposable comic book epic. He triumphs in every department from superb casting to thoughtful plotting. Stewart and McKellen embellish 'X-Men' and provide it with the kind of dignity that Alec Guinness brought to 'Star Wars.' When Magneto and Xavier speak, their conversations sound like the oral equivalent of a chess match. 'X-Men' hits the mark because Singer and Hayter fuse superior dramatic elements in the best Aristotelian fashion; its heroes experience a tough time winning.",10,0,1,6 April 2008
Spider-Man 3," 'Spider-Man 3' weaves too much of everything in its web to be the fun movie it could have been.
","The third entry in the Marvel Comics superhero saga, 'Spider-Man 3' suffers from a long-winded lecture against revenge, too many villains, too much plot, and special effects so conspicuously computer generated that the ambitious action scenes look even more like a video game than those in the first two films. One minute we have writer/ director Sam Raimi and co-scripters Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent exhorting us from the celluloid soapbox of their $300 million plus movie to embrace forgiveness rather than exact revenge and that happiness boils down to making the right choices since the wrong ones will destroy you. The next minute the filmmakers regale us with high-flying, gravity-defying acrobatics between characters so indestructible that is comes as something of a surprise in the last reel when they show signs of mortality. Incredibly, Spider-Man appeals for help from his nemesis when it appears that he may be on his last legs. Between this slipshod blend of heroics and homilies, Raimi and company continue to reheat the chick flick soap opera love triangle with Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn that drags out everything to a tiresome 140 minutes. Happily, everybody from the previous 'Spider-Man' movies reprises their roles, but several are given the short-shrift in this tedious tale.Earlier 'Spider-Man' epics wisely kept things evenly matched; the heroic webslinger never battled more than one enemy. Unfortunately, 'Spider-Man 3' makes the same mistake that those overblown 'Batman' sequels committed when they pitted the Caped Crusader against tag-team adversaries. The 'Batman' movies suffered because they wasted lots of valuable time establishing colorful bad guys who never stood a chance against the hero. Similarly, 'Spider-Man 3' suffers, too, because his opponents here aren't especially memorable. Not only does Spider-Man tangle again with Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, but also he has to deal with the shape-shifting Sandman as well as another evildoer named Venom who resembles Spider-Man, except for his pointed little teeth.As 'Spider-Man 3' opens, our hero (Tobey Maguire) basks in the limelight of public affection. New York City officials have finally decided to honor Spidey for his many good deeds and the Big Apple presents him with its key to the city. Predictably, not long afterward, events change for the worst, and Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Durst of 'Elizabethtown') emerges as the first casualty. Broadway theater critics ridicule her stage debut as a diva, and she loses the lead in the show. Our poor heroine has to stoop to taking an ignoble day job warbling in a jazz bar when she isn't waiting on customers. It doesn't help matters that her boyfriend Peter Parker's alter-ego Spider-Man overshadows her. Moreover, her eyes turn green with jealousy when he puckers up during the key ceremony in classic Spidey fashion with the latest damsel, collegiate classmate Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), another character from the comic book series, that he has saved from disaster. Meanwhile, Harry (James Franco of 'Flyboys') still wants Spider-Man to pay for killing his father.Were Peter and Harry's feud not enough, 'Spider-Man 3' antes up another villain, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church of 'Sideways'), the misunderstood miscreant who really murdered Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) in the first movie. Miraculously, Marko manages to escape from prison, but he has the misfortune to stumble into a mammoth science project where he is transformed into the Sandman. The villainous Sandman behaves like an irradiated character from a hokey 1950s' sci-fi/horror epic. He has the power to transform himself into a towering giant on the scale of Godzilla. At the same time, Peter faces new competition from another shutter-bug, wiseacre Eddie Brock (Topper Grace of 'Traffic'), who aims to replace him at The Daily Bugle as Spider-Man's exclusive photographer. Just when you're beginning to suffer from sensory overload, Raimi and company toss in a mysterious meteor oozing with symbiote, an inky black, gooey alien substance which brings out the evil in humanity. This slimy stuff attaches itself to Peter and preys on his baser instincts. Suddenly, Spidey appears at crime scenes decked out in an all-black outfit. Anybody who has seen the 'Star Wars' movies knows that Peter has gone over to the Dark Side. Eventually, in keeping with the film's heavy-handed message, Spider-Man learns that giving into evil is not the right choice.Sadly, 'Spider-Man 3' never achieves the right mix of morality and melodrama. Indeed, Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Oscar winning scenarist Alvin Sargent deserve good citizenship accolades for advocating forgiveness over revenge, but they should have saved their sermon for another movie about realistic characters instead of shallow-minded superheroes. Things get so woebegone in 'Spider-Man 3' that after he whips one villain, Spidey accepts the polecat's apology and lets him take off for parts unknown. Credibility should be the last factor to interfere with a superhero movie, but 'Spider-Man 3' treats its characters inconsistently. Spider-Man and Harry spend the first half of the movie surviving some pretty incredible things. In the second half, however, Raimi and company ask us to worry about these characters as if they were mortals despite their earlier death-defying feats. If there must be a 'Spider-Man 4,' Hollywood needs to make a quantum leap in computer-generated technology and Raimi needs to remember that summer movies should deliver excitement, intrigue, and adventure, not preach about moral issues. 'Spider-Man 3' weaves too much of everything in its web to be the fun movie it could have been.",6,0,1,2 December 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Sibling Rivalry Like You've Never Seen!!!
","Chris Hemsworth looks like he had a blast making 'Eagle Vs Shark' director Taika Waititi's colorful, tongue-in-cheek, superhero saga 'Thor: Ragnarok,' the third—and best--entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe about the Asgardian God of Thunder. 'Thor: Ragnarok' shares more in common with director Kenneth Branagh's origins epic 'Thor' (2011) rather than with Alan Taylor's sequel 'Thor: The Dark World.' Unlike the first and third movies,' 'Thor: The Dark World' (2013) maintained a serious and straightforward tone. Basically, the second 'Thor' spurned comedy, slaughtered Thor's mom Frigga, and reformed Thor who had behaved like a blowhard. Comparatively, Waititi and his three scenarists, Eric Pearson of 'Marvel One-Shot: Agent Carter,' Craig Kyle of 'Planet Hulk,' and Christopher L. Yost of 'Max Steel,' not only ridicule Thor, but they also challenge the Son of Odin as he has never been tested. Typically, superhero sagas qualify as predictable since you know the hero will vanquish all adversaries and restore order to the cosmos before the end credits. Although the original 'Thor' was seldom surprising, our hero suffered the consequences of his hopeless arrogance. Odin deprived his son of his supernatural hammer Mjölnir and banished him to Earth without powers. Good movies run their heroes through a gauntlet, and 'Thor: Ragnarok' pits the God of Thunder against a virtually invincible adversary--his heretofore unknown, elder sister Hela. While she is more than enough to keep him occupied, Waititi and his writers have added the Incredible Hulk. These adversaries keep Thor behind the eight-ball for three-quarters of its swiftly-paced 130 minutes. Thor tangles with enemies for the first time who can withstand the worst he can dish out. Hela ranks as one of his more memorable foes, and two-time Oscar winning Best Actress Cate Blanchett has a field day as Hela. Decked out in a black, dominatrix outfit, this Goth-looking gal resembles Angelina Jolie's 'Maleficent,' and the antlers that spring from her head before combat make her appear genuinely sinister. When he isn't dodging Hela, Thor tackles the gigantic Hulk in an off-world gladiatorial arena.As 'Thor: Ragnarok' unfolds, we learn the wicked fire demon Surtur (voice of Clancy Brown) has captured our eponymous hero and plans to execute him. The haughty Surtur informs Thor that Odin no longer sits on the throne of Asgard. Furthermore, he explains that a long, foretold prophecy referred to as 'Ragnarok' with bring about the impending destruction of Thor's planet. Once he plunges his crown into the Eternal Flame in Odin's vault, Sutur boasts that he will conquer Asgard! Trussed up like a turkey fit for a feast, Thor listens to Sutur's boasts until the God of Thunder's wayward hammer homes in on his location like a boomerang. Thor smashes the fire demon's dreams to smithereens. He hastens to Asgard and discovers that his shape-shifting, half-brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston of 'Kong: Skull Island'), has been impersonating Odin, who has been exiled to Earth. While he awaits death, Odin warns them that his first-born child, Hela (Cate Blanchett of 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age'), will break out of her prison and attack Asgard. Earlier, Odin had incarcerated his daughter because she harbored ambitions far greater and destructive than his own! No sooner has Hela returned to Asgard than she shatters Mjölnir as if it were glass and drives Thor and Loki off. Afterward, Hela eliminates all of Thor's compatriots, while the God of Thunder ends up on the remote planet Sakaar where gladiator combat is the rage.The Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum of 'Independence Day') rules Sakaar and conducts himself like the Roman Emperor Commodus. Commodus dictated which gladiator would triumph, even if he had to rig the outcome. The Grandmaster has acquired an unrivalled champion in the form of the Incredible Hulk who vanished under mysterious circumstances after the battle at Sokovia in 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015). Thor surprises everybody when he clocks Hulk. Previously, nobody left the arena alive after fighting Hulk, but Thor impresses the Grandmaster enough that the tyrant allows him to live. Thor tries to recruit the Hulk to accompany him back to Asgard to overthrow Hela. Scrapper 142 (Tessa Thompson of 'Creed'), the bounty hunter who delivered Thor to the Grandmaster, keeps him restrained with a tazer. Eventually, Thor persuades her to join Hulk and he in a revolt against Sakaar's founder. Further, Thor learns that Scraper 142 was a Valkyrie who fought against Hela and left after nearly dying in battle. Meantime, Hela has lain waste to Asgard, but this doesn't dissuade Thor from returning to rescue his people and then take them to a new homeland. The scenes that depict thousands of Asgardians seeking refuge aboard a space freighter evoke memories of the British Army's evacuation of Dunkirk during World War II.'Thor: Ragnarok' provides new perspectives on the franchise and exposes a wealth of untold backstory about Odin and Asgard before Thor's birth. The revelation about Odin's bloodlust for the conquest of alien realms makes him appear unsavory rather than avuncular as he appeared in the first two 'Thor' epics. Hela's clash with the Valkyries resembles an Italian Renaissance painting come to life. A low-budget, little-known independent director, Waititi brings an entirely different vibe to the otherwise hackneyed material. Waititi and his writers rely on humor to give the lead character as well as several supporting characters a greater sense of depth. They have breathed new life into the franchise by cutting Asgard out from under the Thor, exiling Odin, and demolishing Mjölnir. Thor often behaves like a buffoon, and it feels liberating to laugh at his oafish antics. Comparatively, Cate Blanchett radiates a malevolent pugnacity as Odin's first-born who lives to slay. She makes an unforgettable villain. The scenes where she massages her temples and antlers erupt is striking. Hela's comeuppance is as spectacular as it is satisfying. The comic touches in 'Thor: Ragnarok' may not sit well with some fans who will frown on such shenanigans, but this refreshing irreverence is long-overdue.",10,4,10,20 November 2017
Match Point," People Who Hate Woody Allen Movies Might Love This One
","No, this is not your typical Woody Allen movie. First, it isn't a comedy. Second, unless you were well versed in Woody Allen movies, you'd never think that 'Match Point' was a Woody Allen movie. Third, the plot takes place beyond Woody's usual haunts. Basically, a tennis instructor Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of 'Mission Impossible III') falls into the good life when one of his tennis students, Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode of ' befriends him. He thinks that everything in life is the result of luck. The protagonist--because he certainly shouldn't be considered heroic--quits teaching tennis. He marries his good friend's sister Chloe Hewitt (sweet Emily Mortimer of 'Pink Panther'), but he falls recklessly in love with his friend's girlfriend, Nola Rice (sultry Scarlett Johansson of 'The Island'), a struggling actress looking for roles in England, and they have a torrid affair that he must conceal from Chloe. Meanwhile, poor Chloe complains that she cannot have a baby and Chris and she visit many fertility experts and struggle to have a child. At the same time, the other woman, Nola, gets pregnant. Initially, the husband (Rhys Meyers) was infatuated with Nola, but his star rises because his father-in-law, Alec Hewitt (Brian Cox of 'The Glimmer Man')hires him to work in his huge company. Things are exploding for the protagonist at this time. He is assured of wealth and happiness and the very thing he sought outside of his marriage becomes an anathema to him. This synopsis takes 'Match Point' up to about the first hour and a half of its two hour plus running time. Woody Allen paces this melodrama superbly and he captures the English way of life and language. I cannot reveal what happens in the last 36 minutes. Indeed, I was on my feet, walking around as I watched those last 36 minutes. The suspense--based on the outcome of this feature--was simply unbearable. The suspense doesn't end until the last three minutes of the film and Allen has you on the edge of your seat throughout those final 36 minutes. Women probably won't like this Woody Allen movie for its incredible, unpredictable ending. I still cannot believe how surprised that I was when the movie finally did end. The performances are flawless; nobody delivers a bad performance. The two detectives at the end of the movie were fantastic! One of them is the fantasdtic Ewen Bremner of 'Alien Vs. Predator'). When I bought this previously viewed DVD from Movie Gallery, I thought that I was in for a typical, run-of-the-mill Woody Allen drama. Boy, was I mistaken!",10,1,3,6 December 2007
Yes Man," Just Say No To Carrey's 'Yes' Jest!
","Just say NO to the new Jim Carrey comedy 'Yes Man' (** out of ****), a frivolous exercise in high-concept celluloid that co-stars dishy Zooey Deschanel and grim-faced Terence Stamp. This one-note nonsense about a negative-minded man who realizes the affirmative power of the word 'yes' recalls an earlier Carrey epic 'Liar, Liar' (1997) about an unprincipled lawyer who prevaricated at the least provocation. The gimmick in 'Liar Liar' was his son's birthday wish that his father couldn't fib. Consequently, the reformed attorney had to tell the truth no matter what the situation.In 'Yes Man,' the rubber-faced funny man must say 'yes' to everybody with a request. Inevitably, our hero's life takes some hallowing turns, but nothing really surprising happens. Well, perhaps something surprising occurs in one scene where dentures in a glass of water on a night stand figures prominently. Mind you, moviegoers who appreciate risqué humor will split their sides laughing. Fastidious folks, on the contrary, may grimace with horror and feel offended by this salacious twist.Along with its single usage of the F-word as prescribed by the Motion Picture Association of America in all PG-13 flicks, 'Break Up' director Peyton Reed's 'Yes Man' recycles the typical boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl back tale. Audiences that adore Carrey's elastic-cheeked clowning no matter what he does may find this far-fetched foolishness farcical. Discriminating audiences will feel like they've been cheated, even at matinée prices. At 104 minutes, 'Yes Man' qualifies as more mess than merriment.Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) loves to say 'no.' As a bank loan officer, nay saying is second nature to him. As it turns out, our pitiful protagonist lost his wife, Stephanie (Molly Sims of 'Starsky & Hutch'), after six months of marriage because she felt Carl was too dull for her own good. Since their divorce three years ago, Carl has shunned his friends, particularly Peter (Bradley Cooper of 'The Comebacks') and Rooney (Danny Masterson of 'Face/Off'), and confined himself to his apartment watching Blockbuster DVDs. At work, Carl tolerates his goofy boss, Norm (a hilarious Rhys Darby of ''The Flight of the Conchords'), who keeps inviting him to his masquerade parties. Speaking of product placement, this Warner Brothers release shamelessly touts its own movies, such as the 'Harry Potter' franchise and '300' for Norm's parties.One day while he is relaxing outside the bank, Carl meets a former bank colleague, Nick (John Michael Higgins of 'Evan Almighty'), who lives life to the hilt and shows no ill effects for all his reckless indulgence. So impressed by Nick's carefree attitude is Carl that he attends a self-help seminar hosted by charismatic Dale Carnegie-type counselor Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp of 'Superman') who preaches about the positive power of saying 'yes.' Appropriately enough, Carl resists the urge to say yes, but the crowd around him changes his mind.No sooner has our hero left the seminar than a shrewd homeless man, who has been taking advantage of Bundley's converts, hits up Carl for a free ride to a far-off park, the use of his cell phone, and every dollar in his wallet. Not only does Carl run out of gas by the time he reaches the park, but also the homeless guy (Brent Briscoe of 'Mr. Woodcock') has depleted Carl's cell phone battery. Carl traipses several miles back into town to fill up his gas container. At the gas station, he meets free-spirited, non-conformist Allison (Zooey Deschanel of 'The Happening') who is gassing up her motor scooter. She sports a helmet with Tweety Bird eyes painted on it so you know she is a little wacky, too. Anyway, Allison offers Carl a ride, and he says 'yes' to a new relationship. At the same time, Carl decides to take flying lessons, guitar lessons, learns to speak Korean, and searches for a spouse at the website persianwifefinder.com. Eventually, things sour for our love birds because Allison learns that Carl has programmed himself to say yes to everybody.Watching Jim Carrey is always a treat because he is so spontaneous. His physical humor and his facial antics are as infectiously funny as ever. The contrived screenplay by 'Fun with Dick & Jane' scribe Nicholas Stoller as well as newcomers Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogol, however, runs out of comic momentum about 45 minutes and becomes hopelessly predictable. One amusing moment occurs when our hero saves a suicidal man (Luis Guzmán of 'School for Scoundrels') by using his newly acquired guitar playing skills and getting the man as well as a crowd of spectators to join him in a sing-along.Carl's love interest is flaky as all get-out; she teaches a photography class where students jog around Griffith Park and snap photos. You'd think Allison would have noticed how Carl always blurts out 'yes' to anybody. She decides to dump our hero because she feels that he isn't so much attracted to her ridiculous life-style as he is committed to the 'yes' covenant he made with Bundley. Meanwhile, Rhys Darby matches Carrey's maniac comic energy with his use of childish nicknames and nerdy parties. Terence Stamp, who played General Zod in the Christopher Reeve 'Superman' movie, makes a great comic foil as the harried guru who bullied Carl into taking his covenant and regrets having done so during our hero's fourth-quarter meltdown.Indeed, the 'Yes Man' trailer makes this movie look far better than it is. Aside from the possibly objectionable scene with an elderly, sex-starved neighbor who promises to relieve our hero's anxieties, 'Yes Man' amounts to a made-to-order, upbeat date movie. Nevertheless, compared with Carrey's funnier films, especially his 'Ace Ventura' movies, 'Yes Man' is one big No-No.",4,3,6,24 December 2008
The Terminator," The First Major Cinematic Cyborg Thriller of Them All!!!
","'Piranha 2: The Spawning' director James Cameron scored his first major cinematic hit with 'The Terminator,' a gritty, on-the-run, rough-hewn, low-budget science fiction actioneer about time travel with a curious twist. Body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger virtually guaranteed that this 107 minute exercise in murder and mayhem would be a blockbuster with his villainous, straight-faced portrayal of a relentless cyborg that will allow nothing to stand between its programmed objective of executing a woman, Sarah Connor, in the past. The chief science fiction element in Cameron's film is the use of predestination paradox where it appears the history is being altered, when in fact, it is really being fulfilled. Cameron rehashed much of the 'Terminator' action in the sequel, but he made the Schwarzenegger more sympathetic by having him serve as young John Connor's bodyguard. Ironically, this $6-million plus movie wasn't that original because cyborg characters have been around in fantasy literature as early as Edgar Allan Poe. Nevertheless, 'The Terminator' put cyborgs on the map more than 'The Six-Million Dollar Man' and eventually inspired the 'Robocop' franchise.'The Terminator' opens in Los Angeles in 2029 A.D., at night while enemy Hunter Killer hovercraft prowl the post-apocalyptic rubble of the city for human prey. Heavy combat vehicles with massive treads on their wheels crush hundreds of human skulls into powder while human survivors exchange fire with skeletal metal terminators with fiery red eyes. A preamble of sorts comes up and sets the scene: The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here in our present . . . tonight. The actual story unfolds at 1:52 AM when a garbage truck driver watches crackling blue plasma-type waves envelope him and his vehicle.A garbage truck operator is emptying trash bins when a plasma-like web of jagged blue lighting bolts envelopes his vehicle and shuts off the vehicle's power. He flees when the T-101 Terminator assassin (Arnold Schwarzenegger) appears naked out of nowhere. Skynet has sent the T-101 from the future back to the year 1984 to kill the mother of resistance leader John Connor. The naked t-101 saunters up to a trio of punks at the Griffith Park Observatory overlooking Los Angeles. An obnoxious, blue-haired punk (Bill Paxton of 'Aliens' and 'Twister') and his friend (veteran heavy Brian Thompson of 'Sudden Impact' and 'Cobra') ridicule T-101. The Terminator kills both of them while the third strips off his clothing. Meanwhile, elsewhere in L.A., another naked man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn of 'The Rock') materializes from the future. He steals a homeless man's pants, evades the L.A.P.D., and breaks into a clothing store, steals Nike sneakers and a trench coat. Whereas the T-101 wants to kill Sarah, Kyle wants to save her! Not surprisingly, young Sarah Connor doesn't have a clue that anybody yearns to either murder her or save her life.Sarah works at a fast-food restaurant. The T-101 finds three Sarah Connors in the L.A. phone book and kills the first two and then invades Sarah's apartment and kills her roommate Ginger and Matt (Rick Rossovich of 'Top Gun') her boyfriend. Eventually, Sarah discovers what is happening and holes up at a night club called Tech Noir where the T-101 tracks her down. Kyle Reese rescues Sarah and they flee, but the L.A.P.D. capture them and Reese has to cough up his far-fetched story to a by pompous psychologist Dr. Peter Silberman (Earl Boen of 'Alien Nation') who doesn't believe a syllable of Reese's saga. Silberman diagnoses Reese as suffering from paranoid delusions and boasts that he make a career out of analyzing the guy's stories. During Reese's interrogation scene at police headquarters with Silberman, Cameron and co-writers Gale Ann Hurd and an uncredited William Wisher, Jr., provide audiences with crucial expository information about Skynet and the war with the cyborgs that seek to annihilate mankind.The bulk of 'The Terminator' concerns the T-101's tireless efforts to kill Sarah while Reese struggles to lead her to safety. During their flight, Reese and Sarah become romantically involved and Reese gets Sarah pregnant with future resistance leader John Connor. Talk about twisted time travel?! Cameron intersperses a flashback to the future where a T-101 (Schwarzenegger's pal Franco Columbu of 'Beretta's Island') invades a resistance bunker and goes on a murderous rampage before he is eliminated. Throughout the blazing action sequences, Cameron gradually strips the T-101 down to its alloyed metal endoskeleton. Reese explains to Silberman that a Terminator is a cyborg, half-man, and half-machine that will never stop until it kills Sarah. Everybody at the police station regards Reese as a fruit cake with his unbelievable story until the T-101 shows up with an arsenal of weapons and shoots up the premises, killing at least 17 cops. Reese and Sarah escape, hid out in a motel where they build pipe bombs, but the resourceful T-101 finds Sarah's mother, kills her off-screen, and imitates her so that it can learn Sarah's whereabouts. Another ramped up chase ensues with the T-101 caught in a blazing 18-wheeler. The fire scorches its entire body in the last 15 minutes so that all that remains is the skeleton. Reese dies blowing the skeleton in two. The torso of the T-101 continues to stalk Sarah until she crushes it in a tool manufacturing factory so that only the hand and forearm, which appears in the sequel 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' James Cameron has more road trip action in this thriller than actual science fiction, but the action-packed scenes more than deliver their quota of thrills and chills. One of the earliest scenes in a pawnshop has the T-101 gathering an arsenal of hardware from an unsuspecting clerk (Dick Miller) and then killing him instead of paying for it. The 'I'll be back' scene at the police station massacre is probably the best scene in this supercharged little spine-tingler.",8,0,1,23 May 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellacious, High Spirited Hokum!
","Writer & director Guillermo del Toro's fertile imagination knows no limits. The award-winning Mexican helmed the Marvel Comics' vampire sequel 'Blade 2,' the groundbreaking Dark Horse comics' original 'Hellboy,' and the Oscar-winning whimsy 'Pan's Labyrinth.' Indisputably, 'Hellboy 2: The Golden Army' surpasses its entertaining 2004 predecessor as a slickly-made serio-comic science fiction epic that pits its fireproof, scarlet-skinned protagonist against adversaries more audacious and outlandish than in the original. At the same time, our cigar-smoking, cat-cuddling hero matures in some surprising ways. The gallery of ghouls and goblins with whom Hellboy contends is both diverse and diabolical. A towering beanstalk menaces Hellboy; an Angel of Death with eyes in her vulture wings instead of her face shows him mercy, and cadaverously pale cannibalistic Tooth Fairies swarm after him like schools of ravenous piranha. Synthesize elements of 'X-Files' with 'Men in Black,' and you'll have an accurate idea what 'Hellboy 2: The Golden Army' has to offer. The most intriguing creature appears in the third act. What appear to be huge boulders strewn about in a field turn out to be the body of a stony Goliath slumbering.'Beauty and the Beast' TV star Ron Perlman is both hilarious and hardheaded as the kitschy Dark Horse comic book superhero 'Hellboy.' Literally, Hellboy is half-humanoid and half-demon, but brick-red all over. While it makes matters simpler if you've seen the first 'Hellboy,' you don't need to have seen the original to appreciate this silly but super-charged sequel. Basically, Nazi occultists with help from infamous Russian madman Grigori Rasputin spawned Hellboy during a secret experiment in World War II in the original. The U.S. Army stormed the Nazi stronghold and liberated a small red devil that Rasputin had conjured up from an unearthly portal and summoned to Earth. Professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt of 'Heaven's Gate') adopted the cuddly demon and raised him like his own son. Since then Hellboy has grown up, but this alien life-form doesn't age like humans. Partially, he resembles the Incredible Hulk with his enormous physique; puffs on stogies like 'X-Men's' Wolverine, lugs around a gargantuan revolver that Dirty Harry would envy and wears his devil horns filed down to look like a World War I pilot's goggles so he will blend in with the scenery. No matter what our sympathetically our hero behaves, Hellboy rarely blends in with humanity.The U.S. Government has recruited the trench-coat clad Hellboy with two other mutants: his blue, amphibious, psychic sidekick Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and his scorching babe of a girlfriend, Liz Sherman (Selma Blair of 'The Sweetest Thing') who can transform herself into an inferno, for its ultra-secret agency, the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. According to the exposition, FDR chartered the B.P.R.D. to deal with extraterrestrial threats. No, 'Hellboy' doesn't take itself any more seriously than its wonderful predecessor did and the charm of this sequel lies in its self-effacing humor. 'Hellboy 2' briefly recaps Big Red's origins. Happily, although he died in 'Hellboy,' Professor Broom reappears here in a cameo. Broom delights the 11-year old Hellboy with a bedtime tale about an ancient war between humans and elves. Ultimately, humanity won control of the cities, while the trolls assumed control of the forests. However, humanity has broken its promise and encroached on the forests with its malls and parking lots. The incensed son of Elf King Balor, pugnacious Prince Nuada (Luke Goss of 'Blade 2'), has decided to abandon the truce between mankind and the elves. Initially, Nuada's father Balor (Roy Dotrice of 'Nicholas and Alexandra') had assembled a golden army of mechanical warriors that 'never knew hunger and could not be stopped,' but Balor kept this invincible army in check, much to his son's chagrin.A peerless martial arts expert, Nuada plans to massacre humanity with his father's long dormant golden horde. Before he can mobilize the army, Nuada murders his helpless father in cold blood without a qualm while his incredulous twin sister Nuala (Anna Walton) watches in horror. Nuada's Achilles heel is that anything that happens to his twin sister can exact a similar toll on him. Nuada embarks on a scavenger hunt to locate three parts of a magic crown that will enable him to command these mechanical combatants. Meanwhile, FBI liaison to the B.P.R.D., Agent Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor of 'City Slickers'), enlists 'ectoplasmic' but anonymous Professor Johann Krause (James Donn) to supervise Hellboy and company. Krause is as bizarre a character as they come. Dressed in a deep sea diver's outfit, he never shows his face, and speaks with a clipped, cartoon-like German accent. When Hellboy isn't clashing with either Nuada or his fantastic monsters, our hero wrestles with an even harder rival, his temperament girlfriend Liz who harbors a secret that will forever alter Hellboy's life.Not surprisingly, the imposing Perlman dominates this lighthearted but larger-than-life fantasy, and the scene with Hellboy as a child gives more depth than usual to such a character. Furthermore, Hellboy has to run a gauntlet of some of the most visually impressive monsters of the summer. Indeed, Hellboy gets his butt kicked before he kicks butt. As the malignant Nuada, Luke Goss drips evil; Goss resembles the old rock star Edgar Winter. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Tambor provides welcome comic relief as the bureaucratic Manning. Altogether, 'Hellboy 2: The Golden Army' qualifies a real supernatural sizzler with a sense of humor!",9,0,1,23 July 2008
Cloverfield," A Pathetic Post-Modernist Pseudo-'Godzilla' Rip-Off
","The late great circus showman P.T. Barnum would stand up in his grave and applaud the advertising campaign that 'Lost' creator J.J. Abrams designed for his new monster movie 'Cloverfield,' an allegory for the 9/11 disaster aimed at the You Tube generation. Essentially, 'Cloverfield' is 'The Blair Witch Project' meets 'Godzilla' with a bit of 'Independence Day.' Sadly, this appalling 85-minute epic about a quartet of twentysomething adults out to rescue one of their own generates only a modicum of excitement, suspense, and horror. Like 'Blair Witch,' 'Cloverfield' relies on the gimmick of shooting its catastrophic action entirely from the viewpoint of a guy looking into the viewfinder of a camcorder. Actually, '84 Charlie Mopic,' a little known, low-budget, 1989 Vietnam War movie, utilized the same gimmick with greater imagination than either 'Blair Witch' or 'Cloverfield.' Indeed, whether they realize it or not, the people that made 'Cloverfield' have imitated most of what '84 Charlie Mopic' did with its saga about a combat photographer shadowing a special seven man reconnaissance unit on a dangerous mission.People that suffer from motion sickness might want to gobble some Dramamine before they see 'Cloverfield.' The action chronicles a troupe of Yuppies throwing a farewell soirée for Robert Hawkins (newcomer Michael Stahl-David of NBC-TV's 'The Black Donnellys') who is bound for a new job in Japan. Anyway, Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel of 'Poseidon') is supposed to shoot video testimonials. Jason pawns this chore off on his pal, Hud Platt (T.J. Miller of ABC-TV's 'Carpoolers'), who uses it as a way to greet girls. Meanwhile, Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman of 'Transformers') quarrel. She retreats to her Central Park high-rise apartment. Not long afterward, shock tremors typically associated with an earthquake stagger New York City. TV news stations televise images of pandemonium. Out of nowhere the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty careens like a bowling ball down a Manhattan street. Eventually, word of a 'Godzilla' sized reptile rampaging through Manhattan reaches our heroes. The power flickers everywhere, and panic erupts. Our heroes learn that nothing in the Pentagon's arsenal has been able to thwart this humongous monster's stompfest. Rob ignores warnings from the Army and sets to rescue Beth trapped in her own apartment. Along the way, Rob and his friends battle baby monsters that spring from the main monster.'Pallbearer' director Matt Reeves and 'Lost' scenarist Drew Goddard take a fantastic idea and fluff it. The camcorder that Hud tapes the action with doesn't sport a stabilizer so you'll feel like you're being whirled around in a Cuisinart. Unfortunately, aside from a few eerie shots, 'Cloverfield' lacks adequate hysteria or suspense. The characters behave as idiotically as 'Friday the 13th' victims, especially when they plunge into a dark creepy subway tunnel. The monster resembles the offspring of Dr. Seuss' Horton the Elephant character. Nothing emerges as remotely scary, and gore is held to a PG-13 minimum. 'Cloverfield' offers no closure, and it makes you pine for a man in a rubber Godzilla suit.",1,3,11,25 January 2008
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's Top Western!!!!
","The world emerges as a hostile, inhospitable setting in writer & director Quentin Tarantino's second western 'The Hateful Eight,' and everybody but the innocent bystanders winds up getting what they deserve. Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, and Channing Tatum seem never at a loss for words in this consistently entertaining but abrasively self-indulgent horse opera. Like a typical Tarantino tale, 'The Hateful Eight' wallows in blood-splattered carnage, punctuated by gunfire, and intensified by politically incorrect subject matter laden with scatological, R-rated profanity. Set in a sprawling mosaic of snow-swept Wyoming mountains, this suspenseful bounty hunters versus outlaws western methodically unfolds like a claustrophobic but chatty Agatha Christie drawing-room murder-mystery. Predictably, Tarantino shoots the works with both surprises and shocks that keep this static outing interesting as well as melodramatic. A suspicious bounty hunter escorts a homicidal dame with a $10-thousand dollar reward on her head for a date with the gallows. During his journey, the bounty hunter encounters various gunmen and takes refuge with them in a remote stagecoach relay station during a freezing blizzard. The predominantly all-male cast is nothing short of exceptional, but this doesn't eclipse Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as a slimy villain. Now, if you're not an ardent connoisseur of all things Tarantino, you may find yourself exiting the premises before the film reaches its midpoint. Scruffy, loud-mouthed, bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell of 'Tombstone') has chartered a private stagecoach to transport his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh of 'Backdraft'), to the town of Red Rock. He is taking Daisy in alive to watch her hang for her crimes. Unlike most bounty hunters, Ruth prefers to show up with his prisoners alive rather than dead. Along the trail, Ruth runs into another bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Pulp Fiction'), who is smoking his pipe perched atop a stack of three frozen corpses. Major Warren gunned down these three guys for the collective $8-thousand dollar bounty on their heads. Unlike Ruth, Warren takes no chances and shows up with his desperadoes dead rather than alive. Major Warren explains that his horse fell dead during the trip across the mountains, and he inquires if Ruth will give him a lift. Reluctantly, Ruth allows Warren to climb aboard. Before Warren can enter the stagecoach, Ruth orders him to surrender his two six-shooters to the coachman, O.B Jackson (James Parks of 'Machete'), for safekeeping. Later, another man stranded on foot, Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins of 'Cowboys & Aliens'), who claims to be the sheriff of Red Rock flags them down. When Ruth demands to see his badge, Mannix explains that he was riding to Red Rock when his horse stepped into a gopher hole and he had to shoot it. Initially, Ruth refuses to believe Mannix. Mannix explains that Red Rock recently lost their sheriff and that he is replacing him. Since he hasn't gotten to Red Rock yet, he doesn't have a badge. Furthermore, Mannix argues that Warren and the coach driver will serve as witnesses to testify against Ruth if Mannix is found frozen dead in the snow because Ruth wouldn't oblige him. Glumly, Ruth lets Mannix join them. Before he lets Mannix aboard, Ruth strikes up an uneasy alliance with Warren. Ruth lets Warren reclaim his revolvers and promises to protect him if Warren will watch over him, too. An infamous Confederate marauder, Mannix is wary of Major Warren who is an ex-Union cavalryman with his own notorious reputation. According to Mannix, Warren burned down a Confederate prison camp to escape from it. During the conflagration, more than forty young Confederate recruits died. CSA President Jefferson Davis put a bounty on Warren's head and Federal authorities drummed him out of the cavalry. Basically, the three men aboard the stagecoach remain deeply suspicious about each other despite any deals they may have forged. Eventually, the stagecoach arrives at a lonely relay station called Minnie Haberdashery where six horse stagecoach teams are changed while the passengers rest and refresh themselves. Warren is surprised to learn that Minnie and her family not only have left the relay station in the hands of a Mexican, Bob (Demián Bichir of 'Savages'), but also have gone to visit friends. Meantime, Ruth ushers Daisy inside at gunpoint and interrogates the three guests about their identities and destinations. He learns that an Englishman, Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth of 'Reservoir Dogs'), is a hangman in route to Red Rock. The other man, a drover back from a cattle drive, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen of 'Die Another Day'), is heading to see his mother on the far side of Red Rock. Ruth disarms both men, dismantles their revolvers, and sends O.B. into the freezing storm to dump their firearms in the nearby outhouse. The other guest, elderly Confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern of 'The Cowboys'), doesn't own a gun. Nevertheless, Ruth doesn't trust any of them, and he keeps Daisy attached to a chain around his wrist. Meantime, Warren doesn't believe Mexican Bob's story about Minnie, but he doesn't have enough evidence to call him a liar.'The Hateful Eight' clocks in at 168 minutes. Essentially, Tarantino takes his own sweet time developing these characters. If you're looking for role models, you won't find them. These guys and especially the girl are all dastards. Nevertheless, die-hard Tarantino fans will find it in their hearts to forgive him for the elongated running time, applaud his spontaneous, slam-bang violence, and chuckle at his ghoulish gallery of gruesome characters. Indeed, Tarantino's eighth feature film lives up to its title, and some parts of it are more hateful than other parts. Compared with Tarantino's previous seven epics, this gritty, gimlet-eyed western resembles 'Reservoir Dogs' with 'Pulp Fiction' excerpts. In fact, the director has said that not only he was influenced by Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti westerns, but also the cult science fiction horror movie 'The Thing' that starred Kurt Russell.",10,6,28,4 January 2016
Gettysburg," Admirable But Flawed Epic Worth Watching
","'Little Darlings' director Ronald F. Maxwell's admirable but flawed epic 'Gettysburg' qualifies as one of the better movies about the American Civil War. Unquestionably, it ranks as the best reenactment of this turning point battle because nobody has tried to mount a similar movie. Nevertheless, 'Gettysburg' suffers from several flaws. Initially, the film was designed to be shown on television as a mini-series, so at a four and a half hours in length, it rivals anything that either David Lean or Sergio Leone could have attempted. Second, its loquacity occasionally overwhelms its sense of spectacle, but loquacity constitutes the hallmark of any mini-series. Everybody delivers a speech. Everybody who speaks is typically a general or an officer. Most of the dialogue is straightforward without a shred of irony. Rarely is anything uttered that is quotable. The enlisted men in blue and gray aren't so much heard as seen. On the other hand, Maxwell scores surplus points for apparent authenticity, with dedicated reenactors on up to conscientious American history scholars providing incomparable verisimilitude. Undoubtedly, Maxwell had more than enough to contend with during this sprawling $20-million production. My major argument is tone. 'Gettysburg' boasts no surprises and Maxwell generates little momentum. During the actual event, the Confederates arrived at Gettysburg feeling invincible owing to earlier triumphs. Maxwell's Confederates are losers from the start and the music blends nostalgia with tragedy. Indeed, Maxwell treats 'Gettysburg' as a national tragedy. Kees Van Oostrum photography is competent, but neither Maxwell nor Oostrum were as adept as they were later when they made the infinitely superior 'Gods and Generals.' Nevertheless, what salvages Maxwell's film is the magnificently staged Pickett's Charge, particularly the cannon barrages over a smoky battlefield. Tom Berenger, Stephen Lange, Richard Jordan, Jeff Daniels, Sam Elliot, and Kevin Conway stand out as the leaders.",7,2,3,12 March 2015
We Were Soldiers," Mel Gibson needs to make more movies as exciting and entertaining as 'We Were Soldiers.'
","John Wayne would stand up in his grave and salute Mel Gibson if he saw 'Braveheart' director Randall Wallace's patriotic tribute to the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry in 'We Were Soldiers,' with Madeleine Stowe, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, and Sam Elliot. This sentimental but adrenalin-laced Vietnam-era war saga about the first battle between the U.S. Army and uniformed North Vietnamese troopers in November 1965 eschews politics and eulogizes the valorous Americans that fell on the field of honor. Unlike the best-known Vietnam War spectacles, such as Michael Cimino's 'The Deer Hunter' (1978), Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' (1979), Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' and Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987), all of which loudly condemned the war, 'We Were Soldiers' confines its criticism to the periphery of its explosive pyrotechnics.Nevertheless, this gritty, gung-ho, Mel Gibson, flag-waver is quietly contemptuous about this most ill-handled of American wars. When General Westmoreland wants Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson of 'The Road Warrior' with a good ole boy southern drawl) to leave the battle and debrief him miles away in Saigon, Moore simply refuses and remains alongside his men. Chiefly, 'We Were Soldiers' represents the first major Hollywood combat epic to portray the North Vietnamese as flesh and blood mortals with respect and dignity. How willingly American audiences embrace this surprisingly sympathetic treatment of Ho Chi Minh's minions will determine the success of 'We Were Soldiers' at the box office as well as its overall role in healing our national wounds.'The Man in the Iron Mask' scenarist-turned-director Randall Wallace based his old-fashioned but cliché-cluttered combat screenplay on the 535-page, non-fiction best-seller by Lieutenant General Hal Moore (Ret.) and war correspondent Joseph Galloway entitled 'We Were Soldiers and Young.' Opening in 1954, 'We Were Soldiers' shows the wily North Vietnamese Army ruthlessly wiping out French troops in the Ia' Drang Valley, a.k.a. 'The Valley of Death.' 'If you kill all they send, NVA commander, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An (Don Duang of 'Three Seasons') contends, 'they will stop coming.' Eventually, the French stopped coming. The U.S. military followed in their ill-fated footsteps eleven years later. The rugged terrain of Vietnam prompted Pentagon strategists to deploy troops by helicopter. They picked Lt. Col. Hal Moore, a Harvard graduate with an International Relations degree, to command the newly redesigned Airborne, 7th Cavalry. The first half of 'We Were Soldiers' follows Moore as he acclimates his troops to helicopters. He instills in one young officer, Second Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein of 'Rollerball'), the importance of caring for his men. Veteran Sergeant-Major Basil Plumley (scene-stealing Sam Elliot of 'Dog Watch'), who prefers his reliable .45 automatic pistol to the new M-16 assault rifle, shadows Moore.Flying Moore's men into combat is ace chopper pilot Major Crandall (Greg Kinnear of 'As Good As It Gets') in his best ever action role. Wallace provides glimpses of Moore's home life with his wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe of 'Bad Girls') and their five rambunctious children. Inevitably, when President Johnson orders them into action, our heroesall 395 of them-wind up in the Valley of Death pitted against 4000 NVA regulars during a devastating three day engagement. The bullet-riddled second half of 'We Were Soldiers' climaxes in Vietnam with savage hand-to-hand combat.Covering ground similar to Ridley Scott's superb 'Black Hawk Down,' 'We Were Soldiers' boasts not only more heart and soul, but it also exhibits bouts of grisly violence. Mel Gibson needs to make more movies as exciting and entertaining as 'We Were Soldiers.'",8,2,5,8 June 2008
Dear John," The Pain and Anguish of a Long Distance Relationship
","The only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of a long distance romance and the dire consequences that occur when you are separated from your lover. If you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of Sparks' previous films, such as 'Message in a Bottle,' 'Nights at Rodanthe,' and 'A Walk to Remember,' think again. Nobody dies from a tragic accident trying to save somebody else, though the romance here does transform these characters, but in seemingly the worst way. If anything, it makes them even more miserable than they were unless an implied eleventh hour happy ending that seems to come as an afterthought so the movie closes on an upbeat note. This is one of those romances where the least competitive character wins the girl, strictly because he is around when she needs him. Indeed, the man and the woman back home qualify as villains, while the patriotic hero is ironically the martyr.A soft-spoken U.S. Special Forces Army Sergeant, John Tyree (Channing Tatum of 'G.I. Joe'), is on leave from the military when he has a memorable two-week fling with an impressionable college girl, Savannah Curtis (radiant Amanda Seyfried of 'Mamma Mia'), who is spending her spring break in South Carolina. John has spent the morning surfing. He is lounging on a pier when she spots her for the first time and she drops her purse—('her whole life is in that bag'')-into the ocean. Before the guy with her, Randy (Scott Porter of 'Descent'), can recover the purse, John plunges into the water and retrieves it. Randy asks for the purse, but John has no intention of giving it to him. Randy and John eventually settle their differences. Anyway, John is interested in Savannah. They go out on a romantic, night-time date, and he wants to repeat the experience. Savannah doesn't drink, smoke, but she tells John that her head is filled with profanity. Inevitably, John and Savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep-inducing by any standard. Tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class. Just as they are getting hot and heavy between them, suicidal terrorists crash planes into the World Trade Center. John reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with Savannah.Meanwhile, another guy, shaggy but likable family friend Tim Wheddon (Henry Thomas of 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial') who has a motherless, autistic son named Alan (Luke Benward) becomes the object of Savannah's sentiment. She is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. She is an idealist without a clue. She delays what seems forever –actually two months--before she finally contacts Tyree with the eponymous letter. Basically, Savannah dumps Tyree for a scruffy guy afflicted with cancer! This reminded me of the standard scene in a movie where the heroine rushes to the rescue of the guy who gets beaten up rather than the one who does the beating up. Later, she confesses to John that she knew the sound of his voice would have shattered her resolve to marry Tim, so she doesn't make that fateful call. Predictably, John agonizes over Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in a military hospital in Germany. The circumstances surrounding John's wounds are rather ironic. He is reassuring another soldier who has been by the same sniper but who survived the shooting because his body armor saved them when the bullets struck him. While all this is transpiring, Tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin-collecting father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of 'Step Brothers'), who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. Their relationship is poignant and a lot is left unsaid with only the performances of the two actors to flesh it out. It seems that his father was on his last legs after John got out of the hospital. The physician who attended Mr. Tyree explains that he—John Tyree—couldn't have intervened in his father's death. Richard Jenkins delivers another devastating performance as a peripheral character whose hobby is coin-collecting, something that initially enabled him to bond with his son. The lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of Tyree constitutes an incredibly low blow. Tyree, his father, and Tyree's commander, Captain Stone (Keith Robinson), are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance.'Dear John' leaves you feeling pretty low until the final scene. Tyree is a civilian who is locking his bicycle to a downtown parking meter when he spots Savannah in a restaurant. She rushes outside to hug him. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' director Lasse Hallström and 'We Are Marshall' scenarist Jamie Linden give us the impression that Tyree and Savannah will live happily ever after since Tyree is finished with the military and Savannah has laid Tim to rest. If you've ever had a girl dump you, this is the kind of movie that will hit you where you live. One of the best things about this film is that it knocked James Cameron's 'Avatar' out of the top spot at the box office when it came out.",7,2,6,8 February 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One of the Top 50 Westerns of All Time!
","'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' ranks as one of the top 50 westerns of all time. This agile, amusing oater about two notorious outlaws who roamed the great Northwest robbing banks and trains is not your ordinary, conventional horse opera. Scenarist William Goldman and director George Roy Hill changed all the rules. For example, unlike most outlaw sagas, the eponymous heroes are never shown dying on screen because there is some dispute about where they died. Instead, the film ends on a freeze-frame of them charging into the open with their revolvers drawn. Mind you, this 1969 Oscar nominee for Best Picture is still a status quo western because our affable heroes are still punished for their misdeeds, but Butch and Sundance were not murderous felons prone to blowing the heads off their adversaries. In fact, Butch does not shoot anybody until the duo wind up in Bolivia. There is neither a bad scene nor a bad performance in this post-modern exercise in frontier banditry. Paul Newman and Robert Redford generated so much chemistry here that the played grifter buddies in another epic 'The Sting,' and it did will Best Picture. Ace lenser Conrad Hall who photographed 'The Professionals' and 'Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here' makes the old west look truly nostalgic. The bickering banter between our two heroes is absolutely hilarious in this comedy/adventure epic.The action opens as Butch (Paul Newman of 'The Left-Handed Gun') is scouting a bank to rob and learns that they have installed new, state-of-the-art equipment to protect the bank from outlaws. 'That is a small price to pay for beauty,' Butch remarks and heads back over to the saloon where his sidekick, Sundance (Robert Redford of 'The Way We Were')is playing poker. He wins another hand and the dealer accuses him of cheating. Butch urges Sundance to leave things as they are because he--Sundance--is getting over the hill. Quietly, Sundance refuses, and the dealer challenges him to a shoot-out. The dealer (none other than Sam Elliot) overhears Butch tell his partner, 'I cannot help you now, Sundance.' The dealer suddenly changes his mind. However, before Sundance is willing to leave, he compels the dealer to ask them to stick around. 'Why don't you stick around,' the frightened dealer asks. 'Nah, we gotta go,' Butch replies. Before Sundance exits the saloon, he whirls and blows the gunbelt off the dealer and fires more bullets that send the gun belt skidding across the floor.Our heroes ride back to their remote hang-out, Hole-in-the-Wall, where they learn the Harvey (Ted Lynch of the original 'Adams Family') has decided to take over the gang since Butch is rarely around. Butch defends himself by noting that he has to do research to rob banks and trains. The gang informs him that they intend to hit the train both coming and going, but Harvey challenges Butch for leadership of the gang in a knife fight. 'What about the rules, Harvey?' Harvey blinks at Butch, 'Rules?! In a knife-fight?' Butch kicks Harvey in the genitals and cold-cocks him with a blow to the head. Actually, Butch likes the plan and they hit the railroad both times. The second time that they strike, they have to festoon the safe with more dynamite that necessary. The explosion destroys the boxcar, shatters the safe, and sends dollar bills floating like confetti. About that time, a second train arrives and a posse of sharpshooting gunmen descend on them. They wipe out the entire gang and chase our heroes to an isolated cliff and Butch and Sundance have to take a high plunge into a river.After this fiasco, Butch learns from schoolmarm Etta Place (Katherine Ross of 'The Graduate') that Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad has launched a manhunt to bring them in dead. Our heroes decide to relocate to South America where the pickings are easier. They have several musical interludes and we hear B.J. Thomas sing the immortal song 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head' while Butch rides a bicycle--the symbol of a new age--and narrowly escapes being gored by a bull. In South America, they prosper until the army comes after them. Eventually, they go straight and work as bodyguards for a mine owner (Strother Martin), but Bolivian bandits rob them and our heroes shoot it out with them.This is an immensely enjoyable western that even women should love.",10,0,1,11 December 2009
Ocean's Twelve," Woefully Short on White-Knuckled Thrills and Chills
","Hi-tech heist thrillers about criminal masterminds out to crack ultra-sophisticated security systems to filch a fortune in either millions of dollars or objets d'art thrive or dive based on the gadgetry our heroes resort to and the suspense their efforts generate. While 'Traffic' director Steven Soderbergh's new caper movie 'Ocean's Twelve' (** out of ****) boasts an array of gadgets, this slick, stylist, but superficial sequel to Soderbergh's own remake of 'Ocean's Eleven' comes up woefully short on white-knuckled thrills and chills. In other words, the protagonists get off far too easy. Indeed, as the film's ads aver, the entire 'Ocean's Twelve' cast reprise their respective roles, but this time around they perform with considerably less charm and individuality. In 'Ocean's Eleven,' each participant possessed a unique talent that lent itself to their efforts to knock over three Las Vegas casinos in one night. Now, in 'Ocean's Twelve,' Soderbergh gives their talents short-shrift and has them behave like a herd. Lushly produced and beautifully lensed in exotic Continental locales, principally Amsterdam and Rome, 'Ocean's Twelve' supplements its contrived, already overcrowded narrative nonsense with two new characters. An arrogant but wily French cat burglar named 'The Night Fox' (Vincent Cassel of 'Jefferson in Paris') and a curvy, overzealous European female investigator (Catherine Zeta-Jones of 'Intolerable Cruelty') make things tougher this time for George Clooney, Brad Pit, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, Julia Roberts and Elliot Gould as they try to pinch a priceless Faberge egg. Overlong by about twenty minutes with endless wrap-up details, 'Ocean's Eleven' isn't half as entertaining as Soderbergh's 'Eleven.' This plodding potboiler packs in too many false alarms, too many conveniently-staged, last-minute surprise reversals, and a shamelessly absurd celebrity cameo subplot to its rambling, improvised plot about revenge and rivalry among thieves. Ultimately, for all its glossy production values and star-laden talent, 'Ocean's Twelve' is bland to the point of anonymity, with our heroes rarely breaking a sweat. Meaning, if you want to see a bunch of Americans loafing in Europe with no chance of anybody getting killed for their criminal ambitions, 'Ocean's Twelve' qualifies as a leisurely way to let two hours and ten minutes elapse.'Ocean's Twelve' starts well, immediately putting our ensemble of protagonists together behind the proverbial 8-ball. Vegas magnate Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia of 'Confidence') has blood in his eye after Danny Ocean (George Clooney of 'Solaris') and his chums stole $160 million from three of his casinos. Benedict and his hostile-looking hoods catch up with the boys individually and warm them that they have two weeks to pay back the entire amount with interest. No, it doesn't matter to Benedict that the insurance companies have already made good his enormous losses. Instead, as far as Benedict is concerned, it amounts to a point of honor in the underworld. Benedict will look like an easy mark if he doesn't retaliate for what Ocean's Eleven did to him on his own turf. Initially, our heroes decide to pull their next job overseas because they are too hot stateside, so they head off to Amsterdam. Meanwhile, Ocean's second-in-command Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt of 'Troy') has gotten himself hopelessly entangled with a skirt, undercover Europol agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and she refuses to let anything or anyone stop her from busting Rusty. Again, the original cast doesn't get to do what they do best. Meanwhile, Soderbergh tries to pull off a gag involving Julia Roberts impersonating herself. You'll either be amused (I wasn't) or exasperated (I was) with this shoddy writing. One thing that Soderbergh and co-scenarist George Nolfi of 'Timeline' do well is getting the heroes behind the 8-ball. They throw more obstacles at them than they did in the original. Once they have the odds totally stacked against them, Soderbergh comes up with a less than credible payoff that anybody with one eye could see through in a New York second. Good try, but no cigar. 'Ocean's Twelve' garnered a PG-13 rating for its profanity, because nobody gets shot, smashed-up, or sexually assaulted in this so-so saga. Clearly, the tide has turned the wrong way with 'Ocean's Twelve.'",4,0,1,21 June 2007
Snatch," British Crime Goes From Rags to Ritchie's 'Snatch'
","Although they don't produce as many gangster movies as we Americans, the British know how to make some proper, first-rate, sure-fire crime thrillers. Movies such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob' (1951), 'The League of Gentlemen' (1960), 'Robbery' (1967), 'The Italian Job' (1969), 'Get Carter' (1971), 'Sitting Target' (1972), 'McVicar' (1980), 'The Long Good Friday' (1981), 'Buster' (1988), and 'The Krays' (1990) exemplify the upper tier of British crime cinema.This sub-genre of crime movies has not been tampered with until recently when an unknown helmer of rock videos and commercials made his first feature in 1995 called 'Hard Case.' Since then he has crafted the two of the best British crime thrillers in years and rekindled interest in the sub-genre with imitators mimicking his work. Were it not for his marriage to music diva Madonna, we'd probably not be sampling his latest effort in the theaters but waiting for it to appear on the video rental shelves. Guy Ritchie is his name, and Ritchie is rapidly becoming the Francis Ford Coppola of mobster movies in English. (Unfortunately, Ritchie's latest endeavor 'Revolver' didn't fare well enough in its theatrical run or with the critics to follow up his previous hits.) Ritchie, who helmed the downright gritty, raucously violent, but thoroughly entertaining gangster epic 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,' pounds the mean streets of London once again with his quirky crime comedy 'Snatch.' Starring Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Rade Sherbedzija, Vinnie Jones, and Dennis Farina, this splendidly-lensed, ballistically-edited, multi-plotted British mobster saga boasts elements of Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction,' Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas,' David Fincher's 'Fight Club,' George Roy Hill's 'The Sting,' and Warren Beatty's 'Dick Tracy.' While 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' detailed the theft of two antique shotguns and the myriad hands through which the guns passed along with a rigged high stakes poker game, 'Snatch' chronicles a diamond heist and the thuggish throng out to nab it as well as unlicensed underground boxing matches. Indeed, while both movies appear roughly similar in plot convolutions and revelations, even sharing cast members Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones, 'Snatch' surpasses 'LS&TSB' with its 'Sting' ending. People that don't like Brad Pitt but enjoyed 'Fight Club' will find 'Snatch' just as rewarding a movie, too. Like 'LS&TSB,' the real star of 'Snatch' is writer & director Guy Ritchie. He blends comedy and crime without compromising on morality. Bad people pay the piper in this movie, and the consequences of crime are never given the short shrift. Nevertheless, Ritchie has the gift of conjuring comedy in the most unsavory situations. Whether he shows us a dog that chomps a squeaky toy and squeaks afterward with every breath it draws or a fat getaway car driver that can barely squeeze into and out of a small automobile, Ritchie knows how to tweak the formula at the appropriate time and place.'Snatch' opens with our reluctant hero, Turkish (Jason Statham), narrating his tale of woe about how his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) and he have mired themselves in the mother of all messes. Everything starts when Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and his gang hold up an Antwerp jeweler and steal an 84-carat stone for his boss, Avi (Dennis Farina of 'Get Shorty'), who is sweating it out back in New York City. Franky lays over in London, meets Russian racketeer Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedzija) who supplies him with a gun free of charge if Franky will place an illegal boxing bet for him. Eventually, an alarmed Avi freaks out when Franky doesn't show up. Avi contacts his jeweler cousin, Dog the Head (Mike Reid), about Franky's gambling addiction and jumps on a jet for England. Meanwhile, Boris hires two inept black pawnshop dealers, Vinny (Robbie Gee) and Sol (Lennie James), to mug Franky and rip-off the rock. Their botched attempt at sticking up a bookie's secret betting joint will have you slapping your knees and laughing out loud. They wind up kidnapping Franky because they cannot break the chain on the attaché case cuffed to his wrist. The action shifts gears back to Turkish. He dispatches Tommy to buy a caravan to replace the dilapidated trailer that serves as headquarters for his boxing enterprises. Poor Tommy gets taken for everything by a band of Irish gypsies led by Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt of 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith') who decks Turkish's new boxing champ, Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty), with one devastating right hook when he challenges Mickey.'Snatch' whirls giddily around in so many circles that you almost get dizzy keeping up with its characters that randomly pop in and out of the action. Turkish and Tommy find themselves in deep trouble now because they cut a deal with a crooked boxing promoter, Brick Top (Alan Ford, looking like a maniacal Austin Powers), to have George take a dive in the upcoming fight. Mickey agrees to replace Gorgeous, but George refuses to throw the fight. Anybody that double-crosses ruthless Brick Top can count on not only suffering a horrible death but having their hack-up remains vanish into the feed troughs at Brick Top's man-eating swine farm. Brick Top outlines a frightening but funny scenario about how to dispose of corpses at pig farms, explaining at one point that 'a pig can go through bones like butter.' The dialogue here is not nearly as incomprehensible as it was in 'LS&TSB,' except for Pitt's babbling character. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Farina scoring well as the best of the bunch as the New York diamond fence. Before this hilariously funny, extremely-profane, fast-paced fracas fades out, the dexterous Ritchie has ushered audiences on another surprise-laden, whirlwind excursion through an underworld as loony as it is lethal. 'Snatch' is a top-notch comic caper worth catching.",10,3,6,28 March 2008
BlacKkKlansman," The Klan of Idiots
","Spike Lee's biggest release since 'Inside Man,' 'BlackkKlansman' is a low-key, undercover crime satire that defies credibility about a black Colorado Springs detective who subverted the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. Although Ron Stallworth (John David Washington of 'Book of Eli') infiltrated the KKK, he had to arrange for one of his white police colleagues, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver of 'Lucky Logan'), to conduct all the personal, face-to-face, activities. Obviously, Ron couldn't masquerade in white-face and hope to pull this stunt off without getting lynched. Nothing about what Ron Stallworth achieved during his undercover activities amounted to anything spectacular in the long run. Basically, it is low-stakes all the way. However, the fact that Stallworth could dupe Grand Wizard David Duke and make asses out of the Klan distinguishes this routine, but entertaining yarn. Lee generates a modicum of suspense along the way when Flip must defuse a potential disaster after a KKK bomb specialist, Walker (Nicholas Turturro of 'Takers'), who he had arrested and who now plans to blow Flip's cover. Ultimately, two major things occur in this . First, David Duke (Topher Grace of 'Spider-Man 3') converses with Ron via telephone and assures him that he sounds like a white man because he can pronounce the verb 'are.' Duke explains that African-Americans pronounce 'are' as 'are-uh.' During this explanation, Stallworth's superior, Sergeant Trapp (Ken Garito of 'Summer of Sam'), has to turn away because he has to laugh out loud. The hilarity that comes out of this is contagious as Duke genuinely believes that Ron is white. The more serious action concerns a bomb plot. Felix's devoted wife, Connie (Ashlie Atkinson of 'Bridge of Spies'), plants an explosive package containing C-4 on the Volkswagen car of African-American activist, Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier of 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'), when her original target is aborted. Atkinson delivers the best performance as the sincere Klansman's wife. Indeed, she looks and behaves like simple-minded, white-trash, but she emerges as the most believable character. Spike Lee and freshman scenarists Charlie Wachtel and David Rabinowitz, with Kevin Willmott of 'Chi-Raq' have a field day making the KKK look like clowns. The audacity of Ron Stallworth and the success of his operation highlight this movie. Ironically, after Stallworth wraps up his investigation with the arrest of Connie, Captain Bridges (John Lee Burke of 'Tombstone') pulls the plug on it owing to a shortage of funds. He orders everybody to destroy all records of the investigation. 'BlackkKlansman' is well-worth watching not only as a chapter in race relations in contemporary America, but also a depiction of the buffoonish KKK. Lee caps all these lightweight shenanigans with documentary footage of the tragic The Charlottesville, Virginia, 'Unite the Right' rally (Aug. 2017) where the white supremacists killed a liberal activist Heather Heyer and injuring almost 40 other people. This tacked on ending is probably the most devastating thing about 'BlackkKlansman.' The film was adapted from Ron Stallworth's book. Incidentally, not everything is either true or accurate. For example, Lee and his scenarists set the film in 1972 instead of when it really occurred in 1979. The comedy is fine until the disturbing epilogue that shows how dangerous the idiotic Klan and other white supremacists are.",8,4,9,17 February 2019
The Beach," 'The Beach' Is Nothing Short of Sensational!
","'The Beach,' an exotic, symbol-laden saga about the elusive quest for paradise, qualifies as Leonardo DiCaprio's first serious movie since the controversial 'Basketball Diaries.' The talented 'Trainspotting' trio of director Danny Boyle, scenarist John Hodge, and producer Andrew MacDonald have surpassed themselves again with another marvelously staged, provocatively plotted, and opulently produced film. Based on English author Alex Garland's bestseller, this lofty romantic thriller pays homage to 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Jaws,' 'Lord of the Flies,' 'The Mosquito Coast,' and 'The Swiss Family Robinson' in its abrasive yarn about three, adventure seeking, twentysomethings that gate crash a secret society on a forbidden island in Thailand where a fabled beach unblemished by civilization shimmers in the sunlight.'The Beach' begins sluggishly with our protagonist, Richard (Leonard DiCaprio) restlessly prowling Bangkok, a glitzy decadent tourist trap, before he checks into a shabby but suitable bug-infested hotel. Richard yearns for something dangerous, something to test the bounds of reality as he knows it and attain a state of nirvana. Essentially, 'The Beach' concerns a young man's rites of passage, an end of innocence and illusions, and a descent into the chaos of maturity. At his seedy hotel, where everybody uses a communal bathroom, Richard emerges from the shower, naked except for a towel athwart his waist, and discovers to his embarrassment that he cannot unlock his door. An alluring French babe, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen of 'A Single Girl'), spots him and help him with his door. She blinds him with a smile as her boyfriend Etienne (French heartthrob Guillaume Canet), joins her. Later, a lonely Richard lies awake in bed at night while his French neighbors bang away in the room next door.Enter Robert Carlyle as Daffy. He energizes 'The Beach' as Richard's demented, suicidal lodger from the other side who has fled the island paradise. Daffy provides the necessary exposition, or background information, that sets up the story. While they smoke a joint, Daffy rhapsodizes about the island. Later, before he slashes his wrists and dies, Daffy leaves Richard a map to this mythical place. Richard persuades Francoise, with Etienne, of course, to accompany him on his trip to this topical Shangri-La. Eventually, they arrive on the coast, brave the shark-infested waters around the island, and find themselves standing at the edge of a sprawling field of marihuana.Their bliss is ephemeral. Richard spots an adorable tree monkey and then realizes the cute little simian serves as a guard dog. Suddenly, a grim-looking bunch of ganja growers armed with AK-47 assault rifles are scouring the fields for intruders. Director Danny Boyle keeps you guessing throughout 'The Beach,' and this quirky scene exemplifies his bizarre sense of irony. Boyle alternates the good with the bad, so you never see what is coming until it occurs. As the farmers comb the fields, our heroes grovel in horror. Just as they have reached the end of the rainbow, a small monkey stands between them and their pot of gold! The image of a monkey as their nemesis enhances the humor of this scene, too.After our heroes evade the farmers, they stumble onto a hidden sanctuary of an ideology-free commune, 'a beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts,' where everybody lives in apparent harmony. This lost tribe of twentysomethings has erected a bamboo society not entirely unlike the one that the castaways created in 'Gilligan's Island.' Some couples are straight, while other are gay. Boyle glosses over most of the commune members. He fleshes out some characters, like the cook who is obsessed with cleanliness, but he restricts them to the background unless they exert a major role in a scene. Anyway, they grow their own crops; marihuana included, and survive on fish caught from the lagoon. The shortage of feminine hygiene products and batteries for the Game Boys are virtually the only reason that these mod squatters dispatch trading emissaries to the mainland. Basically, they grow enough dope not only to keep themselves blitzed but also to sell to pay for their needs.An uneasy truce exists between these lotus eaters and the pot farmers. The farmers let the hippies live on the other side of the island as long as nobody joins them. They fear that hordes of tourists would bring the law down on them. In one scene, they appeal to the sympathy of the commune with the story that their marihuana crop enables them to provide financially for their own families. Clearly, Richard and company have shattered the calm. While she doesn't warm to them immediately, Sal (Oscar winner Tilda Swinton), the leader of this make-shift society, welcomes them. The late, lamented Daffyshe explainshelped found their colony, but he suffered from depression and went AWOL. While our heroes assure Sal that they have the only existing map, Richard refuses to mention the copy that he entrusted to another group of stoners. Later, Richard's secret comes back to haunt him.The first part of 'The Beach' bristles with adventure, but the second half is more downbeat and depressing. Paradise may not be all it is cracked up to be. Richard's stoner friends becomes his worst nightmare as they paddle to the island and run afoul of the pot farmers. A shark attack plunges the commune into despair until they banish the survivor, who refuses to check into a hospital on the mainland. Everybody else tires of his whining and wants only to catch up on their suntans, casual sex, and volleyball without hearing him cry in agony.Altogether, 'The Beach' is not mindless juvenile pabulum, but an ambitious, serious-minded epic that exposes the dark side of paradise. Those who enjoyed 'Shallow Grave: and 'Trainspotting' will find that 'The Beach' addressed the same themes that Boyle and his collaborators have dealt with before in different settings. Nothing predictable stagnates the storyline, and the main characters are more than horny, one-dimensional pawns.",10,1,4,20 March 2008
Fast & Furious 6," As 'Fast and Furious' As Ever!!!
","The latest installment in the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise 'Fast and Furious 6' (*** OUT OF ***) resembles a James Bond extravaganza more than a urban epic about illegal street racing. Some cinematic franchises live and some die, and I'm still surprised that this one didn't collapse when Vin Diesel refused to star in John Singleton's '2 Fast 2 Furious.' Afterward, the second sequel 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift' (2006) looked like a surefire blow-out. Channing Tatum slipped behind the wheel for Asian antics, but Vin Diesel graced the end credits scene, imparting his official blessing. Diesel reprised his role as streetwise Dominic Toretto in 'Fast and Furious' (2009) and teamed up again with FBI Agent Bryan O'Connor (Paul Walker). You can always tell a franchise by the number of characters that each entry cuts loose, and the 'Fast and the Furious' has been conservative. Dom's girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) died in this outing, and our heroes exacted maximum vengeance on the villain. 'Fast Five' (2011) reunited Dom and Bryan along with everybody else. Our heroes went to Rio de Janeiro and stole a bank vault with enough loot in it to relax. In a tacked on, end credits scene, the filmmakers revealed that Letty hadn't died! The franchise sacrificed one obnoxious character, Vince (Matt Schulze), who radiated all the charisma of a zombie. 'Five Fast' introduced U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), and provided our heroes somebody to elude. Hobbs returns for the sixth 'Fast and Furious' opus, and Letty reappears. The revelation that Letty suffered from a bout of amnesia after a near-death experience sounds like something from the Universal Pictures' franchise 'Bourne Identity.' Incidentally, Universal also produces 'The Fast and the Furious' franchise. Until 'Fast 5,' the 'Fast and the Furious' movies didn't knock off any of their own like the 'Rocky' movies. 'Fast and Furious 6,' however, doubles the toll, shuffling off two additions going as far back as 'Tokyo Drift.' Of course, we won't know for sure if they're kaput until 'Fast and Furious 7' comes out.When 'Fast and Furious 6' opens, Dom (Vin Diesel of 'Riddick') and Elena (Elsa Pataky) are living in the Canary Islands with Brian (Paul Walker of 'Pleasantville') and his new wife, Domini's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of 'D.E.B.S.'), who has just had a baby boy. Nobody can extradite them. Eventually, Hobbs shows up and hands Dom an envelope with surveillance photos of Letty. Initially, Dom wants to make it a one-man mission to rescue Letty alone, but Hobbs halts him in his tracks. Not only does Hobbs need Dom, but he also needs Dom's team. Mia insists Brian accompany her big brother while Dom's new girlfriend Elena urges him to find out if Letty is really alive. Meantime, word reaches Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson of 'Baby Boy'), who skipped both 'Tokyo Drift' and 'Fast and Furious.' Gibson served as the comic relief in the last two, and he conjures up laughs galore in 'Fast and Furious 6.' Computer whiz kid Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of 'Four Brothers') fields the same phone call that Roman received and that Han Lue (Sung Kang of 'Better Luck Tomorrow') and his girlfriend forever Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot of 'Fast and Furious') are handed when the Tokyo Police surround them. Before you can say no way, they are back together, and Hobbs explains that Letty is part of a high tech gang of criminals headed up by a notorious former British S.A.S. Officer, Major Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of 'Immortals') who behaves like an adversary from a 007 adventure. Happily, 'Cellular' scenarist Chris Morgan is back for his fourth 'Fast and Furious' along with helmer Justin Lin. These two have turned the franchise around and taken it beyond what anybody could have imagined after '2 Fast 2 Furious.' Shaw is no slouch as villains go, and he keeps Hobbs and our heroes hopping through hoops. Interestingly, when our heroes fall back on surveillance cameras to track Shaw through London, they complain about how you cannot spit in London without a camera catching you in the act. Shaw is the kind of villain who maintains complete control and rarely makes a mistake. Clearly, he isn't prepared when Letty spots Dom and wounds him with a bullet in the shoulder. Our heroine cannot remember Dom because she woke up with no memory in a hospital after her accident in 'Fast and Furious.' This is when Shaw added her to his crew. Shaw lives by a code that he calls 'precision,' and he boots those off his crew when they don't measure up to his high standards. Cyber-terrorist that he is, Shaw is searching for a microchip which will enable him shut down make all U.S. military computers for 24 hours. Naturally, Dom and company demand nothing less than full pardons to help out Hobbs. Nothing about this franchise is remotely realistic, and director Justin Lin embraces 'the ridiculousness' to forge greater suspense and tension. As Dom tells Letty at one point when he saves her life during an incredible stunt, you have to take everything on faith. As it turns out, not only do the filmmakers take everything on faith, but the audiences also seem to be doing the same. In the last 'Fast and Furious' thriller, our heroes dragged a safe through exotic downtown Rio. Just about everything that unfolds in this outrageously entertaining but hopelessly predictable nail-biter is larger-than-life. A duel with a modern army tank on a high-rise bridge jammed with civilian traffic and a spectacular nighttime encounter between our tenacious heroes and a gigantic cargo jet that is reminiscent of the flaming demise of the Hindenburg airship make this movie worth the price of admission. Anybody who wants to take a break from reality will enjoy this fast-paced melodrama with one or two surprises.",8,1,2,2 June 2013
The Expendables," A BLAST from the PAST!!!
","Although it doesn't qualify as the high-minded, movie massacre that 'Rambo IV' was, writer & director Sylvester Stallone's ballistic, high-octane, adrenalin-laced actioneer about mercenaries with hearts of gold delivers its thrills and chills like grenades in your face. A gnarly-looking Stallone assembles an ultra-elite group of combat veterans known as 'The Expendables.' This rugged quintet of mercenaries renovates a South American dictator's palace and wipes out his entire army. This enormously entertaining but thoroughly preposterous tough-guy tale boasts a constellation of legendary B-picture action stars. Clearly, Stallone still wields enough clout to attract Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Dolph Lungren, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture, not to mention Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in cameos, to appear in his movie. Lensed on location in Brazil, New Orleans, and Los Angeles, this brawny but unbelievable, R-rated shoot'em up plays like 'The Big Chill' of action movies. Life in 'The Expendables' is cheap. Bodies topple like raindrops in a storm of gunfire. Bullets splatter heads and atomize body parts. This cynical, hard-boiled thriller bristles with larger-than-life firefights, fistfights, and knife fights. Predictably, sentimentality ennobles our heroes. They behave like the whore with a heart of gold who gives it up for nothing. Far from being cold, heartless automatons, our bulletproof protagonists win both our sympathy and admiration. They live an unwritten code and banish those who abuse it. Looking as fit as he ever, Stallone sports a Van Dyke and lots of tattoos. Not only does Stallone act as the ringleader for these motley mercenaries, but he also wrote the screenplay as well as orchestrated the action sequences.'The Expendables' opens at night in the Gulf of Aiden near Somalia as Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone of 'Rocky Balboa') leads his elite team of mercenaries to ransom hostages from a ship hijacked by ruthless pirates. The pirate leader (Amin Joseph of 'The Mist') isn't satisfied with the $3-million ransom payment that our heroes deposit at his feet. Instead, he complains that the company that employs the hostages has taken far too much time to pay him off. Now, as our eponymous gunmen sight him in with their infrared laser scopes, he demands $5-million. Our heroes quibble about who shoots whom and then Gunnar (Dolph Lungren of 'Rocky 4') jump-starts the action and obliterates the leader with his grenade launcher. Meanwhile, our heroes wipe out the pirates to the last man without harming the hostages. Lee Christmas (Jason Statham of the 'Transporter' franchise), Yin Yang (Jet Li of 'Unleashed'), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews of 'Gamer'), and Toll Road (mixed martial artist Randy Couture of 'Redbelt') watch in horror as Gunnar tries to hang a pirate. Yang deploys his steel-tipped boots to discourage Gunnar, and Barney plunges his automatic pistol into the nape of Gunnar's neck. Since Gunnar has broken their code, 'The Expendables' kick him off the squad. Gunnar has acquired a meth habit that puts him at odds with our heroes. After they get back home, Barney hears about an offer from an anonymous man, Mr. Church (Bruce Willis of 'Cop Out'), who wants to meet him at a church. Barney suspects the man is a C.I.A. agent. Mr. Church invites one of Barney's oldest competitors, Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger of 'Predator'), to listen to his offer. Church wants to topple a ruthless dictator on the South American island of Vilena. Naturally, Vilena is a fictional South American country. Anyway, he wants the man behind the dictator, James Munroe (Eric Roberts of 'The Specialist'), rubbed out with extreme prejudice. Munroe and General Garza (David Zayas of 'Bring out the Dead') have been harvesting illegal narcotics since they toppled the previous head of state. Ironically, the person who opposes Garza with a passion, Sandra (Hispanic actress Giselle Itié), is his daughter. She serves as an escort for Barney and Lee when they arrive to reconnoiter the island. Barney and Lee fly into Vilena in a battered looking amphibious plane. They pose as wildlife conservation experts but they aren't around long before Garza's soldiers take an interest in their curiosity. Our heroes have to shoot their way off the island. Barney wants to take Sandra with them, but she refuses to leave. Later, Barney explains to his team that the operation is a C.I.A. set-up that will probably result in their deaths because the agency cannot be trusted to punish its own. Barney recommends that they turn down the offer. Nevertheless, Barney changes his mind after he thinks about Sandra and her decision to remain in the most miserable place in the world. One of Barney's former mercenary pals, Tool (Mickey Rourke of 'Iron Man 2'), reminisces about an episode in Bosnia when he failed to save an innocent woman. He believes if he could have saved her life, he might have saved part of his own soul. Barney is so moved by Tool's memory as well as the memory of the defiant Sandra that he decides to fly back into an impossible situation and save her. Although Gunnar is no longer with them, the Expendables volunteer to the last man to join Barney. Instead of doing the impossible for a $5-million pay check, Barney and his men do it for nothing. Meanwhile, Munroe has Sandra arrested and tortured so that he can learn the identities of the men who invaded his island paradise. Our heroes return and all hell breaks loose, with blood and body parts flying like confetti.No, 'The Expendables' isn't cute, clever, or particularly literate. The dialogue shoves the plot forward without sounding like bumper sticker philosophy. The one line that really sticks out is uttered by Stallone's character when Trench turns down the mission and heads for the front door. 'What's his problem,' Church asks. 'He wants to be president,' Barney scoffs. They don't have the usual planning scenes with maps and miniatures of the location. Nevertheless, this supercharged macho melodrama will rattle your cage like a blast from the past!",9,5,18,13 August 2010
Scary Movie 2," I enjoyed every minute of this lowbrow, sloppy seconds send-up.
","If you thought 'Scary Movie' scraped the bottom of the proverbial barrel for its bowel humor, 'Scary Movie 2' plumbs even deeper depths of depravity with its politically daring social commentary and its scatological satire. Basically, audiences that roared at 'Scary Movie' should relish this hilarious as hell sequel with its inventive ghostly special effects and audacious, envelop pushing ribald humor. The pea-green soup projectile vomiting parody of 'The Exorcist' alone should prompt the Vatican to condemn the Wayans Brothers' latest installment as blasphemous while its ridiculing of Firestone Tires during a game of chicken in wheelchairs must have seemed too opportune to pass up. 'Scary Movie' director Keenen Ivory Wayans, writers Shawn & Marlon Wayans, and a quintet of other scribes skewer the conventions and clichés of supernatural haunted house chillers instead of 'Scream' slasher sagas. For the record, 'Scary Movie 2' roasts 'Hollow Man,' 'Titanic,' 'What Lies Beneath,' 'Hannibal,' 'Cast Away,' 'The Haunting,' 'Charlie's Angels,' and many other demonic possession epics.'Scary Movie 2' spoofs 'The Exorcist' in a hysterical eight-minute prologue. Father McFeely (James Woods of 'Once Upon A Time in America') shows up to exorcise the demons from Megan Voorhees (Latasha Lyonne of 'American Pie'), but finds himself caught in the middle of a three way barf-a-rama that leaves everybody drenched before they pull guns on Megan. Anyway, during the exorcism, Megan turns to McFeely's sidekick Father Harris (ex-Conan O'Brien host Andy Richter) and quizzes the young priest about the whereabouts of his momma. The infuriated cleric demands that his mom come out of the head whirling witch. No sooner has he uttered his ultimatum that dear old mom peels back the bed covers near Megan, gives her son a dirty look, snaps 'You're no fun,' and exits the room.Abruptly, the action shifts to Jefferson University. An inscription on a monument of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings surrounded by a brood of nappy haired children reads: 'Once you go black, you never go back!' Cindy (Anna Faris of 'Scary Movie'), gay football champ Ray (Shawn Wayans), dope-smoking Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and Ray's loquacious girlfriend Brenda (Regina Hall of 'Enemy of the State') are all attending college now a year after the first 'Scary Movie' ended. Their sexually randy psychology professor, Dr. Oldman (Tim Curry of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'), and his defiant wheelchair bound graduate student Dwight (David Cross of 'Small Soldiers') have arranged for them and some other volunteers to spend the weekend at a spooky mansion. They are participating in a sleep disorders study which really amounts to nothing more than an attempt to document paranormal activity.Director Keenen Ivory Wayans pulls out all stops in this no-holds-barred, R-rated farce. Chris Elliot steals the show as a creepy caretaker with a deformed hand. Ultimately, 'Scary Movie 2' surpasses 'Scary Movie' with its ripe supply of shameless, slapstick shenanigans. Call me sick, but I enjoyed every minute of this lowbrow, sloppy seconds send-up.",10,0,2,22 March 2008
Blade II," The Nosferatu Slayers
","Actress N'Bushe Wright didn't reprise her role as Karen in director Guillermo del Toro's 'Blade II,' but Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson are back for this blood-drenched, action-packed vampire slaying epic. The vampires exploit their own in this surprise-laden tale of complicity, duplicity, and heroism. The opening moments of this ramped-up sequel recount Blade's creation. He begins his narration of the past with the line: 'Forget what you think you know.' Blade has been searching for Whistler, the man who raised him and taught him how to control his affliction and live with it. Whistler was beaten up by the fangsters in the original 'Blade' and he has become one of them in this pugnacious but swiftly-paced sequel. 'Blade II' is comparable to 'Aliens' in franchise terms. 'Blade: Trinity' followed and qualified as a major disappointment, with few of the surprises and cool action scenes of the previous 'Blade' outings. This time around, for the sake of brevity, the Vampire Nation approaches Blade to establish a truce. The ruling Vampire Overlord, Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann of 'Wanted'), offers a truce because they have identified a greater enemy than Blade. The new enemy are called 'Reapers.' Jared Nomak (Luke Goss of 'Death Race 2') has started a one-man war on the fangsters. Worse, when a Reaper (whose elaborately lethal jaw splits into three pieces when it strikes) attacks, its poison doesn't kill the victim. Instead, it turns them into Reapers. As one of the vampire leaders points out to Blade, 'These things are like crack addicts. They need to feed daily.' The always suspicious Blade decides to team up with the Vampire Nation and joins a unit known as 'the Bloodpack.' Moments later Blade is informed that the Bloodpack was formed to destroy him. The Bloodpack consists of Priest (Tony Curran of 'Gladiator'), Asad (Danny John-Jules of 'Red Dwarf'), Snowman (Donny Yen of 'Iron Monkey'), Chupa (Matt Schulze of 'The Fast and the Furious'), Verlaine (Norwegian actress Marit Velle Kile), Lighthammer (Daz Crawford of 'Snitch'), Reinhardt (Ron Pearlman of 'Hellboy'), and Nyssa (Leonor Varela of 'Texas Rangers'), and they've been training for two years to take on Blade.Del Toro stages some exciting action scenes in the sewer of Prague. 'Blade II' looks great, and it takes the franchise to a higher level that 'Trinity' couldn't rival. Snipes was born to play Blade!",10,0,8,29 March 2013
Knocked Up," Funny As Hell
","Writer-director Judd Apatow's 'Knocked Up' qualifies as a hilarious comedy about heterosexual relationships. Moreover, it is about taking responsibility for one's actions. Polar opposites meet, and the woman winds up pregnant. They struggle together to commit to their future child, but life is no picnic for them. A female television production assistant celebrates her promotion by taking the guy who bought her a beer home to indulge into the dirty deed. He misunderstands her in a drunken hormonal frenzy and shirks a condom. Eight weeks later, the truth clobbers them like a sledgehammer. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are cast as products from two wholly different cultures. As Ben Stone, Rogen plays a twenty-three year old Canadian-born stoner living illegally in Los Angeles off the loot he won from a court settlement over an accident. When he hooks up with Allison, Ben has $900 left in the bank. He is living with five other guys and collaborating on an Internet website called Flesh of the Stars. The last thing that Ben thought possible was having sex with a cute babe chick. Allison Scott works on the staff of E!, the Entertainment Show. The last thing Allison was prepared for is conceiving a child by a guy who she has never seen before she met him in a bar trying to get a brew from the bartender. They are drawn together by the circumstances of the pregnancy. Allison refuses to use her sister's gynecologist and searches for her own. Meanwhile, when Apatow isn't focusing on the stormy relationship between Allison and Ben, he is dealing with the trials and tribulations of Pete and Debbie Scott. Paul Rudd and Mrs. Judd Apatow Leslie Mann fill those roles with panache. Debbie is a possessive wife and Pete has problems with her dominance. The cast is absolutely perfect, and Kristen Wigg steals every scene in which she appears.",8,1,4,1 January 2013
Alien," One of the Scariest Horror Movies of All Time!!!
","Ridley Scott's 'Alien' ranks as one of the greatest sci-fi horror sagas of all time. If you haven't seen this landmark epic that spawned a franchise, then you haven't experienced genuine dread. Happily, the years haven't robbed this terrific gem of its skin crawling repulsion. Three sequels that followed in its wake, but only James Cameron's 'Aliens' came close to replicating its intensity. Like any good film, 'Alien' boasts several surprises that will catch you off guard and alarm you. Most of the action is confined to the murky confines of a shadowy spacecraft with passages galore. Reportedly, Scott and scenarist Dan O'Bannon were influenced by director Edward L. Cahn's 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space' (1958) and Mario Bava's 'Planet of the Vampires' (1964) with Barry Sullivan. It is easy to see the resemblance in the plot between 'Alien' and Cahn's epic where a monster boards a spacecraft before it blasts off and the crew spent the entire flight battling the monster as it corners the heroes. On the other hand, the set design in the Bava film is virtually replicated in Scott's film. Mind you, neither of those two inspirations is anywhere near as chilling as 'Alien.' The eponymous monster is a memorable predator that you won't soon forget. Indeed, coursing through the veins of this lethal life-form is acid that eats through the metal hull of the ship.In Scott's atmospheric film takes place in the year 2122. A commercial cargo vessel named the Nostromo is heading home when the ship's computer receives an SOS distress signal, and the seven members constituting the crew awaken from hyper-sleep in their individual sleeping pods and goes to a planet to investigate the signal. They land on this inhospitable planet and check things out. One of the crew, Kane (John Hurt of 'Heaven's Gate') finds himself in an eerie setting, a garden within the hull of a derelict ship that contain curious organisms in small silos. Kane makes the mistake of peering too closely at one of them and the dome shape of the egg peels itself back ominously and something icky surges out of it and penetrates the face plate of his helmet. This nasty organism attaches itself to Kane's face, while another part of it plunges down his gullet, and its snake-like tail coils around his neck. Kane's shipmates rush their fallen colleague back aboard the Nostromo despite the protests of Science Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver of 'Ghostbusters') who doesn't think that Kane should be brought aboard. Ripley fears that Kane has been infected with something hazardous. Nostromo ship captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt of 'M.A.S.H.') intervenes on Kane's behalf and allows him to be brought aboard. They confine Kane to quarantine so they can analyze the creature clinging tenaciously to his face. Miraculously, the creature strangling Kane releases him, collapses to the floor and scuttles away like vermin. Kane revives none the worse for wear, and everybody celebrates his recovery.The sense of relief proves at best ephemeral. While the crew is indulging in a gluttonously repast, Kane coughs and then sprawls onto their table and goes into a palsy. As his shipmates struggle to restrain him, Kane heaves and a pickle-shaped demon erupts from his chest and tears off into the shop. At this point, the dwarf-like critter grows into a huge, ugly creature with a double-set of ravenous jaws. One by one, it eliminates the shipmates until only Ripley is left. In this respect, Scott's grisly film resembles a slasher film because Ripley qualifies as 'the final girl.' Ripley manages to activate the self-destruction phase, after she rescues her cat, and slips into an escape shuttle. Unfortunately, Dallas dies during the final moments after the self-destruct sequence is set into motion. Ripley and Jones make it into the shuttle and prepare for the long voyage back to Earth. Little does poor Ripley realize that the alien beast escaped from the Nostromo before it was obliterated. Eventually, she is able to blow the monster out of the ship. 'Alien' garnered an Oscar for Best Special Effects.",10,1,2,18 September 2016
Blades of Glory," Blades of Hilarity
","The Will Ferrell & Jon Heder 'odd couple' buddy comedy 'Blades of Glory' pokes a lot of good-natured humor at straight-up masculinity with its hilarious pairing of two guys as figure skaters in a competitive sport traditionally dominated by male & female teams rather than a same sex twosome. Imagine the D.B. Sweeney & Moira Kelly romantic comedy 'The Cutting Edge' (1992) with two dudes ice-skating in tandem instead of the usual male & female duo, and you've got an adequate idea about what to expect from co-directors Will Speck and Josh Gordon in their big-screen debut.Speck and Gordon called the shots on two short comedy films, 'Angry Boy' (1996) and 'Culture' (1998), but they are best known for a number of Geico commercials that they have helmed along with the Super Bowl spot TV commercial 'Exaggerating Dad' for Emerald Nuts. Were it not for the brilliance of Ferrell and Heder in the lead roles, this soporific satire about figure-skating would amount to little more than a live-action spin on the venerable 1960s' cartoon series 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,' with real-life married couple Will Arnett & Amy Poehler cast as a villainous combo along the lines of Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. Although brothers Jeff and Craig Cox penned their screenplay based on an idea by Elizabeth Jean 'Busy' Philipps, 'Blades of Glory' virtually replicates the plots of two earlier Ferrell hit comedies 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (2004) and 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' (2006).As super macho athlete Chazz Michael Michaels, Will Ferrell qualifies as the wild man of the skating rink. An alcoholic with a sex addiction dilemma, Chazz resembles a tall, flabby Jim Morrison, when he isn't espousing the politically incorrect mind-set of a drunken Neanderthal, picture the late comic genius John Belushi from either 'Animal House' or '1941.' When we first see him on the ice, Chazz sports a black Waylon Jennings' Stetson, dresses like a biker, and skates to hard-rocking strains of Billy Squire's 1980s' classic hit 'The Stroke.' Women swoon as Chazz skates past them, and they shower him with thongs and double-D bras. No sooner has the pelvic-thrusting Chazz strutted his he-man stuff than rival figure-skating champ Jimmy MacElroy (John Heder of 'Napoleon Dynamite' and 'The Benchwarmers') glides onto the ice to the melodic tunes of Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman. Slender, elegant, tasteful, with a hallo of blow-dried blond hair, Jimmy impersonates a graceful peacock, decked out in a powder-blue, spandex outfit, with a fluff of tail feathers sprouting from his rump. These guys cannot stand the sight of each other either on the ice or off the rink. Indeed, they hate each other with a passion. The recipients of a shared gold medal for men's singles at the Olympic World Wintersport Games, Chazz and Jimmy struggle to tolerate each other during the awards ceremony. Chazz's blend of raunchy cologne with his taco-meat smelling body odor prompts Jimmy to assault him. The two scuffle before an audience of millions while the judges gape in horror.During their fisticuffs, they tip over a flaming candleholder that ignites the costume of a guy inside of a mascot suit. Commissioner Ebbers (the always funny William Daniels, who provided the voice of the car in the 1980s' TV show 'Knight Rider') and a panel of real-life skaters, including Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Brian Boitano, and Nancy Kerrigan, summarily ban Chazz and Jimmy for life from figure-skating.Not only does Jimmy lose his wealthy Donald Trump-style sponsor Darren MacElroy (William Fichtner of 'Armageddon') who had discovered him in a Catholic orphanage and nurtured his figure-skating talent, but also his coach (Craig T. Nelson of 'All The Right Moves') loses his job. Simultaneously, Chazz winds up skating in a children's ice show as a wizard, but he gets fired for boozing it up and puking inside of his costume. The only person who displays loyalty to a disgraced and fallen Jimmy is his male stalker Hector (Nick Swardson, better known as the male hooker Terry on 'Reno 911'), who is under a restraining order to stay away from Jimmy. Hector, however, uncovers a loophole in the bylaws that allows Jimmy to resume his figure-skating career, but only as a participant in a doubles team. Yeah, you guessed it, Jimmy and Chazz team up at the behest of the coach who wants to give them another shot at stardom.Despite some uneven pacing in the early parts of this over-the-top comedy, 'Blades of Glory' serves up a plethora of sight gags and off-color jokes that won't be soon forgotten. Ferrell and Heder make an interesting pair in this definitely off-beat coupling.",7,0,1,1 March 2008
Horrible Bosses," Politically Incorrect But Above-Average Hilarity
","'Horrible Bosses' qualifies as hilarious hokum from fade-in to fade-out. Of course, this imaginative but subversive R-rated comedy of errors about premeditated murder is not designed for everybody. If you can tolerate neither profanity nor homicide, then this laugh-fest may not be appropriate fare. Conversely, if you have or have had a boss who deserved a slow death, 'Horrible Bosses' could make you laugh instead of wallow in your homicidal tendencies. The biggest joke of 'Horrible Bosses,' which truly lives up to its descriptive title, is that the heroes behave like The Three Stooges. Imagine a parody of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train,' except our wannabe killers lack the nerve to go for the jugular. They don't have any murderous bones in their collective bodies. Most contemporary Hollywood thrillers feature one chief villain, but 'Horrible Bosses' boasts three! Two are male, but one is female, while our protagonists are all men. 'Horrible Bosses' contains many amusing scenes, especially when Nick hurls his boss out of a skyscraper. 'Identity Thief' director Seth Gordon gives us a jolt every now and then with pussycats that burst out of nowhere to startle Nick and Kurt.Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman), Dale Arbus (Charlie Day), and Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) all suffer the agonies of the damned as they tangle hopelessly with their respective bosses, Dave Harkin (Kevin Spacey of 'Superman Returns'), Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. (Jennifer Aniston of 'Rock Star'), and Bobby Pellit (Colin Farrell of 'Miami Vice'). Clearly the worst of the three, Harkin qualifies as a smiling sadist with a streak of misanthropy. When he isn't terrorizing poor Nick, Harken believes that his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen of 'Amy's Orgasm') is having sex with everybody but him. Incidentally, Rhonda may be cuckolding Harken because she has quickie bathroom sex with Kurt during Harken's surprise birthday party. Aniston plays a sexy but unscrupulous dentist who takes advantage of Dale, her male dental assistant who is a registered sex offender. Meanwhile, Sudeikis deals with a total swine of a boss who is a cokehead. Colin Farrell stretches the most as an actor here because he looks nothing like he typically does in movies. Here Farrell wears a sculpted beard and has his hair thinned out so he looks like he is losing his hair.After our woebegone protagonists have put up with far too much abuse, they locate an African-American, Dean 'MF' Jones (Jamie Fox of 'Miami Vice'), who is on parole. Initially, they think that he will terminate their bosses with extreme prejudice. One of the running jokes is the use of Dean's profane nickname that our heroes use in the most casual way. Anyway, 'MF' refuses to commit the killings for them, but he agrees to serve as their 'murder consultant' for $5000. At the time, our foolish protagonists believed 'MF' pulled a 10 year stretch in the big house for murder. One of the surprises of 'Horrible Bosses' is that Dean wasn't convicted of murder. He did time because the authorities caught him in a movie theater with a video camera recording a film! Nevertheless, 'MR' tells our hapless trio: 'Most killers are first-timers. You wanna pull off a brilliant murder; you gotta act like it's an accident. Failed brakes, gas leaks, suicide. You do it right, you ain't even gotta be there when it goes down.' Sounds like 'MR' saw the Charles Bronson hit-man movie 'The Mechanic' because the Bronson character staged each hit as if it were an accident. Hendricks remains skeptical about MR's advice: 'Sounds like Scooby-Doo. How are we supposed to fake three accidents?' Our heroes are naturally disappointed by 'MF's lack of participation. According to 'MF,' they must 'stalk their prey.' Second, he continues: 'Gotta be smart. Find out where they live, find out their habits. What's their hobbies?' Nevertheless, 'MR' warns them if they have motives that the 'popo' will find them. Nick points out, 'We all have clear motives for killing our bosses, . . .so this is not gonna work. This is garbage.' 'MF' suggests they 'kill each other's bosses.' This is when Kurt alludes to Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train.' Dale hasn't seen 'Strangers on a Train,' but he has seen the Danny DeVito movie 'Throw Momma from a Train.' 'We kill each other's bosses, there's no link to us,' Kurt observes.During the remainder of 'Horrible Bosses,' comedy galore ensues, particularly while Hendricks and Buckman are in Dave Harken's house, and dimwitted Dale Arbus (Charlie Day of 'Pacific Rim') sits parked outside the house. Harken surprises Dale after the latter has littered and reprimands him for littering. Harken catches a whiff of peanuts and collapses helpless to the pavement, and witless Dale struggles to save Harken's life without realizing who Dave is. Everybody gets their just comeuppance, especially Julia. Director Seth Gordon and his scenarists do an exemplary job of foreshadowing what occurs later in this politically incorrect comedy. One of the biggest surprises occurs outside Bobby's house while Nick is watching Kurt's boss. Donald Sutherland has a brief bit as Kurt's boss. The ending with Nick meeting his new boss, Mr. Sherman (Bob Newhart), is really funny. 'Horrible Bosses' never stops spouting jokes.",8,0,0,24 July 2011
Black Mass," Sluggish Crime Saga with little Cinematic Flair
","'Out of the Furnace' director Scott Cooper's 'Black Mass' qualifies as a gritty, atmospheric, but middling mobster melodrama that chronicles the life and crimes of James 'Whitey' Bulger, a notorious Boston gangster with an Irish upbringing who evaded authorities for 16 years before justice eventually caught and convicted him for 11 homicides. Adapted from a thoroughgoing non-fiction bestseller by 'Boston Globe' reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, this unsavory, R-rated, crime chiller provides 'Pirates of the Caribbean' star Johnny Depp with a chance to atone for far too many silly, superficial comedies. Academy Award-winner Jack Nicholson did an imaginary take on this real-life sociopath in Martin Scorsese's memorable law and order epic 'The Departed,' a mob movie ten times more suspenseful than 'Black Mass.' Now, Depp stars as the infamous felon himself. Although he appears incredibly chilling as the bloodthirsty maniac who is currently serving two life sentences plus five years, nothing about Depp's performance reveals any insights about this heinous individual. Indeed, thanks to prosthetics galore, Depp bears a striking resemblance to Bulger, but nothing beneath his grim, tight-lipped portrayal yields a clue about the murderer's mindset. Reportedly, Bulger refused to talk to Depp about his life. Meantime, this is not the Depp that we have grown accustomed to in movies like the frivolous 'Pirates' franchise, 'The Lone Ranger,' 'Tusk,' 'Dark Shadows,' and 'Mortdecai.' Instead, this is the Depp of 'Public Enemies,' 'Donnie Brasco,' and 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico.' As Bulger, Depp strangles a defenseless young harlot with a rope, beats an adversary to death with his bare fists, and mows downs an unarmed, but treacherous henchman with a carbine. Don't walk into 'Black Mass' and imagine you're going to see something that will make you giggle with glee. Unquestionably, 'Black Mass' constitutes a long overdue return to form for the immensely talented Depp. Critics have hailed his performance as Oscar worthy. As unforgettable as Depp is, the man who steals the show and delivers the best performance is Depp's co-star Joel Edgerton of 'Warriors.' Cast as corrupt FBI Agent John Connolly, who conspired with the real-life Bulger to shield him from prosecution, Edgerton emerges as nothing short of sensational. While Depp relies on prosthetics to impersonate Bulger, Edgerton shuns elaborate make-up and turns the tainted FBI agent into a sympathetic flesh and blood character. He gets under Connolly's skin and shows us what makes the man tick.A profane, violent, but episodic crime thriller, 'Black Mass' covers familiar ground. Director Scott Cooper, who also helmed 'Crazy Heart,' neither pulls any punches in his casual depiction of mob violence nor does he startle us with any surprises. You've seen everything that Cooper stages here in other gangster movies. Essentially, 'Black Mass' is an empire-building crime film, but Cooper doesn't recount either how Bulger established his empire or solidified it with his intimidating reputation. Instead, he dwells on episodes that earlier movies like 'The Departed,' 'Goodfellas,' 'The Town,' 'Killing Me Softly,' 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle,' and the two 'Boondock Saints' thrillers have done before and done with greater panache. Basically, the action unfolds in five year increments, beginning in 1975 as a number of Bulger's cronies cut deals with the Feds to save their necks. Freshman scenarist Mark Mallouk and 'Edge of Tomorrow' scribe Jez Butterworth neglect to explore the psychology behind the treachery that prompted Bulger's underlings to inform on him. Meantime, Cooper focuses almost entirely on the relationship between Bulger and Connolly. The subplot involving Whitey's older brother Billy could have been left on the editing room floor. Incredibly, 'Black Mass' omits some of the more compelling incidents in the page-turning Lehr and O'Neill book. Specifically, the filmmakers have altered the events that brought Bulger and Connolly together as conspirators as well as some of the crimes. A convicted bank robber who did 9-years in Alcatraz, Bulger masqueraded as a Robin Hood-style gangster around South Boston, but his fellow goons weren't fooled by his shenanigans. Ironically, loyalty among these thieves is the first casualty. As the film unfolds, Bulger henchman Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons of 'Varsity Blues'), goes on the record swearing that he isn't a 'rat!' On the other hand, FBI Agent John Connolly worshiped the ground that Bulger trod and refused to testify against him. Connolly grew up in the same blue-collar Irish neighborhood as Bulger. Whitey intervened in a fight where Connolly would have suffered grievously without his support. Connolly struggles to convince his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson of 'Kinsey') that loyalty supersedes morality. Nevertheless, her husband's adulation for Bulger repels her. Connolly sets out to recruit Bulger as a source, but Bulger balks at being an informant. Inevitably, Connolly forges an unholy alliance with Bulger, so the Bureau can crush the Mafia in Boston and he could claim credit for the demise of the Italians. Ultimately, Connolly sold his soul to the devil, while Cooper makes Bulger appear as sinister as Satan.Distinguished by its brooding cinematography, authentic production values, and documentary flavor, 'Black Mass' succeeds more as a tour de force showcase for the actors than a landmark example of a gangster movie. A top-tier supporting cast, featuring 'Sherlock' star Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billy, who carved out a reputation for himself in Congress as a man of the people, surround Depp and Edgerton. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour, and Adam Scott play Connolly's eloquent, well-tailored, FBI colleagues. Harbour delivers a powerful performance as the weak link in the group of FBI agents who turn a blind eye to Bulger's criminal activities as long as he furnishes them with information about the Mafia. As Bulger's amoral associates, Rory Cochrane, Jesse Plemons, and W. Earl Brown will make your skin crawl. Peter Sarsgaard rounds out the cast as one of Bulger's sadistic but ill-fated adversaries. Nobody gives a weak performance in 'Black Mass.' Sadly, for all of his crime-does-not-pay sentiments, Cooper has fashioned a dreary, sluggish crime saga devoid of any cinematic flair or unpredictable spontaneity.",5,8,11,14 October 2015
The Town," Affleck Helms A Tour-de-Torce Bank robbery Thriller
","Ben Affleck sheds his perennial pretty boy image for the Boston-based crime thriller 'The Town' that he stars in and co-scripted with 'Gone Baby Gone' scenarist Aaron Stockard and freshman scribe Peter Craig. Instead, Affleck casts himself as an unshaven, blue-collar, day-laborer with close-cropped hair who works at a rock-breaking company. When he isn't smashing rocks into gravel, he leads a crew of criminals that gives the FBI a run for their money. This realistic, bullet-riddled, bank robbery/armored car heist actioneer qualifies as the best since director Michael Mann's 'Heat' (1995) with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. 'The Town' bristles with compelling characters, suspenseful situations, superbly staged robberies, but no special effects. This sizzling, white-knuckled, cops and robbers saga takes cinematic bank robbery capers to the next level. Indeed, 'The Town' makes 'Takers' look like the work of rank amateurs. The procedures that 'The Town' criminals follow to pull off a heist constitutes the kind of material those old Hollywood movies could never have condoned for fear of serving as a tutorial for crooks. At the same time, 'The Town' doesn't glorify the notorious characters that Affleck and co-star Jeremy Renner play. They pay for the consequences of their larcenous life style. Actress Rebecca Hall plays an innocent bystander who becomes Affleck's unlikely love interest, while Jon Hamm delivers a first-rate performance as a tenacious FBI special agent intent on taking down Affleck. The worst thing that you can say about 'The Town' is that adheres to the police procedural formulaic, but Affleck directs with such verve that you won't be thinking about the formula.'The Town' opens with the factoid that the one-square mile area of Charleston, Massachusetts, has bred more bank robbers and armored-car thieves than any place in America. The first scene depicts the considerable attention to detail that these criminals take to keep themselves from being nabbed. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck of 'Reindeer Games') and his gang splash bleach on the crime scene to remove traces of their DNA. They don ghoulish Halloween masks and outfits, wield fully automatic submachine guns, and destroy anything that might help the authorities to identify them. First, they confiscate all the cell phones from employees and customers and then immerse them in an aquarium of water. Second, another gang member sabotages the surveillance cameras and zaps the memory storage devices for these cameras in a micro-wave oven. When somebody activates a silent alarm, the robbers take a bank employee, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), as a hostage, blindfold her, and bind her hands behind her back. Later, after driving her around to disorient her, they turn Claire loose. Naturally, they torch the stolen vehicle used for their getaway. During the heist, however, Claire catches a glimpse of a tattoo on the nape of the neck of Doug's psychotic, trigger-happy partner, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner of 'The Hurt Locker'), but she doesn't divulge this important detail to FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still') when he questions her. Basically, Coughlin warned her he would kill her if she informs the Feds about anything. Afterward, Coughlin wants to kill her, but Doug intervenes. He assures Coughlin that he will handle Claire.Doug follows Claire to a laundry mat one day, and they strike up a conversation. Before long they are seeing each other casually. Doug doesn't tell Coughlin he is dating Claire. The relationship between Doug and Claire blossoms. Claire tells Doug that she works as a volunteer at the Boys and Girls center and saw a photo of Doug as a youngster. Doug remains guarded about his background He doesn't want to alarm Claire who eventually takes him home for an evening. Previously, Doug drank, gambled, and barbecued with his closest friend James and his sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively of 'Accepted'), and they regard him as family. Krista and he have been casual lovers. Although she has had a baby, Doug denies that the child belong to him. Krista thrives on Oxycontin and cocaine. Earlier, James killed another man who had planned to kill Doug. James spent 9 years in prison for the killing. He uses this incident as a means to cement the bonds between Doug and himself. Doug, James, Desmond Elden (newcomer Owen Burke) and Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (George Carroll of 'The Crack Down') work for a genuinely sleazy individual, Fergus 'Fergie' Colm (Pete Postlethwaite of 'The Usual Suspects'), nicknamed 'the Florist,' who has an inside track on all the jobs they pull. The Feds have never been able to nail either Fergie or Doug, but they have piled up mountains of information about them. For instance, they know Doug's dad, Stephen MacRay (Chris Cooper of 'The Kingdom'), is a convicted criminal in prison, and they keep tabs of every visit Doug makes to see his father.Eventually, Frawley discovers Claire's affair with Doug. If this doesn't complicate matters enough, Coughlin demands that the crew pull another robbery. This time they are taking down an armored car, but Doug has already developed a case of cold feet because of the impact that Claire has exerted on him. Doug wants to quit, leave Boston, and start anew with Claire. Doug has always been plagued because his mom left him when he was age six. Stephen has struggled to make Doug forget about his mom. Matters come really come to a head when Doug and Coughlin almost botch an armored car heist. Meanwhile, the sagacious Feds play their ace card to obtain information about Doug and James. They go after Krista. They threaten not only to bust Krista for illicit drug use, but also they send her young daughter into state care. Finally, Fergie has a really big job planned that will land them $3.5 million. Doug refuses to pull the heist until Fergie threatens to kill Claire and chemically neuter him. 'The Town' erupts with a bang and ends with a bang with surprises galore in between.",10,4,9,19 September 2010
Underworld Awakening," Another Slam-Bang Vampire Vs. Werewolves Shoot'em Up!!!
","Aside from a brief appearance at the end, latex-clad Kate Beckinsale sat out the last 'Underworld' outing 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.' Basically, 'Lycans' served as a prequel to 'Underworld' and its swashbuckling sequel 'Underworld: Evolution.' In other words, the 'Underworld' filmmakers leaped backwards to explore the origins of the franchise, and 'Lycans' wrapped everything up in neat, tidy fashion. In 'Underworld: Awakening,' pistol-packing vampire dame-in-black Selene returns with a vengeance, and she finds herself up to her pretty ears in new shenanigans that pose even greater problems. Sequels are usually measured by how much they develop a franchise. Bad sequels deliver nothing more than the same old stuff with nothing new to distinguish them. In the imaginative hands of scenarists Len Wiseman, John Hlavin, J. Michael Straczynski, and Allison Burnett, 'Underworld: Awakening' takes the franchise in a fresh direction without undermining everything that occurred before it.For the record, Wiseman helmed the first 'Underworld' escapade, and he has produced all four of these exciting, suspenseful vampire versus werewolf sagas. 'Underworld: Awakening' qualifies as Hlavin's freshman bow as a scribe. Anybody who has seen an episode of the legendary sci-fi series 'Babylon 5' should recognize Straczynski as the genius who created that franchise. Meanwhile, Burnett penned both 'Untraceable' and the remake of 'Fame.' They've furnished our trigger-happy heroine with a number of new challenges. Swedish co-directors Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein have taken over the helm, and the audacious action has neither been as fast nor as character-driven as this entry. You could say that 'Underworld: Awakening' knocks the bottom out of the franchise. Although you have to contend with those cumbersome 3-D spectacles, this spectacle of blood, gore, and violence is definite worth the trouble. Mind you, 'Underworld: Awakening' doesn't imitate those old-fashioned 3-D adventure that hurled everything but the kitchen sink at you. Sometimes, you get to see a little flying glass and some blood, but the 3-D manages to contribute to the action. The scene where a gargantuan werewolf slings automobiles at our heroine looks as cool as the scenes where the werewolf mutates from human form.The chief difference between 'Underworld: Awakening' and its predecessors is that mankind no longer stands ignorantly on the sidelines of all the mayhem. Co-helmers Mårlind and Stein provide a prologue that updates us about the radical changes that have transpired, in case you haven't seen any of the earlier epics. The fangsters and their mortal enemies the Lycans have fought each other virtually to the point of extinction. Now, they are battling mankind and humans have taken these monsters seriously enough to virtually wipe them out. Indeed, the best of the vampire Death Dealers, Selene (Kate Beckinsale of 'Much Ado About Nothing') has been captured and cryogenically frozen. In other words, when she breaks out of cold storage, our heroine learns that she has been cooling her heels for more than a decade. A shady biotech film called Antigen has keep Selene on ice along with another subject. When Selene escapes, she discovers that the other subject who has gotten away, Eve (India Eisley of 'Headspace'), is none other than her daughter. Celebrated television talk show host Art Linkletter used to say that kids do the darnest things. Wait until you see what Eve does. Indeed, Eve is a hybrid from the union of vampire babe Selene and werewolf hunk Michael (Scott Speedman) and Antigen chief researcher Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea of 'The Crying Game') has been grooming the little gal to act as a DNA donor.Meanwhile, the remaining vampires have gone underworld, including some of higher-ups, among them autocratic Thomas (Charles Dance of 'Last Action Hero'), who is content to hide out with the covens. No sooner has Eve escaped than Lane sends everything that he has after her and Selene. Although he doesn't have a major role in this adventure, Michael is still alive after an opening gambit that made it appear as if he were toast. The bulk of the action in 'Underworld: Awakening' is Selene struggling to keep Eve out of Lane's hands and scalpel. Along the way, the bodies pile up and nobody has any qualms about pulling the trigger on anybody. When Selene isn't tangling with the humans, who are everywhere, she is menaced by Quint (Kris Holden-Ried of 'K-19: The Widowmaker'), a man who can shape-shift at will into a Goliath of a werewolf. During one sensational scene, Quint watches as Selene battles another werewolf at the bottom of an elevator shaft. Handily, he transforms his fist into a mighty claw and tears the cables holding the elevator car, several floors above him, and then watches with amusement as it plunges like giant anvil toward Selene. Of course, Selene survives this larger-than-life obstacle, but it is the manner in which she emerges that makes the scene as well as 'Underworld: Awakening' so terrific.Clocking in at a nimble 89-minutes, 'Underworld: Awakening' doesn't dawdle. Beckinsale performs her acrobatics with the same poise that she dazzled us with in the first two 'Underworld' shoot'em ups. Another interesting character who appears in this installment is Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy of '2 Fast 2 Furious'), who survives the fracas because he can hit what he shoots at and he doesn't perform the usual stupid human tricks that most expendable cops do in these movies. There are some other surprises left for you, but you'll have to see the film to catch them. Meantime, anybody who enjoyed the earlier entries in the franchise should find 'Underworld: Awakening' an eminently serviceable reboot of the fang & claw franchise.",10,5,12,30 January 2012
Suicide Squad," A Change of Pace For Super Hero Movies
","As the follow-up to 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice,' 'Fury' director David Ayer's DC Comics extravaganza 'The Suicide Squad' qualifies as a gritty, slam-bang, straight-faced, but formulaic action thriller. Although far from realistic in an any conventional sense, Ayer's ensemble epic casts a dark shadow over everything that it depicts and its unsavory psychotic felons tangle with powerful mystical entities from an ancient era. Specifically, the chief villain is almost seven thousand years old and relies on magical incantations. Clearly, the ostensible difference between DC Comics movies and Disney's Marvel movies is night and day, with DC preferring the dark, while Marvel basks in the daylight. Unlike The House of Mouse's Marvel costume-clad, crime fighters, 'Squad' doesn't sugarcoat either its costume-clad convicts or its sinister shenanigans. Interestingly enough, Twentieth Century Fox's three Marvel franchises ('X-Men,' 'Fantastic Four,' and 'Deadpool') land somewhere between DC and Disney. Whereas the 'Captain America: Civil War' characters survived miraculously to fight another day, some 'Suicide Squad' characters die. Most of the characters in 'Suicide Squad' are as repugnant as they are unrepentant, and I don't mean just the heinous criminals that the Government has recruited for Task Force X to perform their unscrupulous chores. The trigger-happy dame who assembles these dastards is pretty despicable herself. Unless you're a literate DC Comics bibliophile, you may not be familiar with the Suicide Squad but they bear some resemblance to Marvel Comics' Avengers but altogether lack their charisma. Historically, the first 'Suicide Squad' bore little resemblance to the cinematic 'Suicide Squad.' Captain Rick Flag and his girlfriend Karin Grace, Dr. Hugh Evans, and Jess Bright battled monsters back in 1959 in DC Comics' 'The Brave and The Bold.' They were all humans and flew jet-bombers. In 1987, DC Comics' Legends Crossover graphic series introduced the new 'Suicide Squad' that consisted of an assemblage of super-convicts, such as Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and Enchantress, similar to those in Ayer's film.As 'Suicide Squad' unfolds, Superman is still dead and gone. Street vendors sell 'Remember' T-shirts commemorating the last son of Krypton. Although Clark Kent's alter-ego doesn't show up for this clash of the titans, anybody with half-a-brain should know that Superman will eventually make an encore appearance. Indeed, Warner Brothers and DC Comics have plans in the pipeline for a 'Man of Steel' sequel. Nevertheless, Superman is nowhere to be seen here, and an unscrupulous, top-level government official, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis of 'The Help'), fears that the next extraterrestrials may not be as benevolent as the Man of Steel. Consequently, she is mobilizing a gang of costume-clad, super-convicts that she classifies as 'the worst of the worst.' When she presents Task Force X, the National Security Council initially wants nothing to do with it. The Pentagon thinks that Waller's idea is foolhardy. In short order, Waller changes their minds. She dispatches one of her motley crew, the witch-goddess Enchantress, aka June Moon (Cara Delevingne of 'Paper Towns'), and Enchantress swipes a top-secret document from Iran that the Pentagon has been desperately trying to seize without success. An ex-Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie of 'Focus'); a cream of the crop assassin Deadshot (Will Smith of 'Concussion'); a guilt-stricken pyromaniac El Diablo (Jay Hernandez of 'Hostel'); a sociopathic Australian bank robber Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney of 'Terminator Genysis'); a mutant half-man, half-crocodile cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of 'Pompeii'); and a specialized assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach of 'Cowboys & Aliens') constitute Waller's group. Rounding out this diversified outfit of unsavory savages is an implacable female ninja, Katana (Karen Fukuhara), armed with a bizarre samurai sword which traps the souls of all who die by its blade. Actually, she serves to protect the group's commander, Special Forces Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman of 'Robocop'), who has a genius for strategic planning. Oddly enough, Flag is involved romantically with June Moon, an archaeologist who blundered into the wrong cave and encountered the spirit of the Enchantress. Unlike the other members of the Suicide Squad who bide their time in a miserable Louisiana dungeon, June and the creepy Enchantress share the same body. Think of the split-personality of the Enchantress and June Moon as a variation on Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Whenever Waller requires June to summon the Enchantress, this untrustworthy 7,000-year old sorceress takes over June's body. Meantime, an elite team of Seals, led by Captain G.Q. Edwards (Scott Eastwood of 'Fury'), are around to mop up what the Suicide Squad doesn't wipe out.'The Suicide Squad'' differs from 'Batman Vs Superman.' Although Batman appears momentarily in two scenes while Bruce Wayne puts in a cameo appearance, the costume-clad convicts dominate matters in 'The Suicide Squad.' They carry or conceal standard-issue weapons, and their outfits aren't as colorful as either Batman or Superman. El Diablo comes the closest to being a superhero because he can transform himself into an incendiary human torch on impulse. Enchantress makes a strong adversary because she can conjure up things out of thin air. At one point, she summons the spirit of her long-lost brother to help her subjugate mankind. Second, 'The Suicide Squad' resembles a zombie combat movie. Our anti-heroic team marches through the apocalyptic wreckage of Midway City as if they were soldiers entering a recently bombed city. The Witch-Goddess Enchantress possesses the power to turn Flag's own men against him. She kills Flag's soldiers and reconstitutes them as her hooligans. In this sense, Enchantress' army behaves like the zombies from 'The Walking Dead,' and they whittle down our heroes. If a witch-goddess with an army of zombies weren't enough with which to contend, our heroes clash with the Joker (Jared Leto of 'The Dallas Buyers Club') who pops up as a largely peripheral villain to rescue his sweetheart Harley Quinn.Clocking in at two hours and three minutes, 'The Suicide Squad' doesn't provide enough detail about some characters, but director David Ayes doesn't squander a second as he parades the convicts to the brink of extinction.",8,1,4,23 August 2016
Elf," A Big Comedy About A Little Character!!!
","Basically, director Jon Favreau's goofy but entertaining Christmas comedy 'Elf' is a 'fish-out-of-water' saga, and David Berenbaum's screenplay relies heavily on incongruity. Visually, 'Elf' is a delightful little movie with interesting characters. The North Pole set and the costumes that the elves wear are colorful.'Elf' concerns an infant up for adoption at an orphanage who crawls into Santa Claus' gift bag during Christmas and winds up at the North Pole. As it turns out, he is raised as one of the elves, specifically Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who serves as the narrator. At six feet, three inches, Buddy (Will Ferrell) cannot do anything right as an elf. Ironically, Buddy has no idea that he isn't an elf. The revelation that he is not an elf staggers him. One day he is shown a picture of his mother and father. Tragically, Buddy's mother died without informing his father Walter Hobbs (James Caan of 'The Godfather') that he had sired him. Buddy sets out from the North Pole and walks on foot to Manhattan where he finally comes face-to-face with Walter. Walter is married, has a teenage son, and works at a book publishing firm. Reluctantly, Walter takes Buddy into his house and disasters galore ensue. Briefly, Buddy holds a job at Gimbels' Department Store in the toy department. When he assaults a man masquerading as Santa Claus, Buddy lands in jail and Walter bails him out. Eventually, after exasperating Walter continually with his adolescent antics, Buddy leaves and is standing on a bridge surveying the river when Santa Claus (Ed Asner) streaks overhead in his sleight with his reindeer. Something goes wrong and Santa has to crash land. Naturally, Buddy heads to his rescue.Light, frivolous nonsense from start to finish, 'Elf' qualifies as scintillating comedy with Ferrell having a field day as the tallest elf on record. This is Ferrell at his finest in an emerald jacket and golden tights. Mind you, the former 'Saturday Night Live' comedian is an acquired taste. He behaves like an imbecile and he stoops to conqueror with lowest common denominator humor. James Caan is appropriately harried as his selfish father, and Oscar winning actress Mary Steenburgen plays Walter's wife Emily, while Zooey Deschanel is cast as Jovie, Buddy's love interest. 'Game of Thrones' star Peter Dinklage appears in an amusing small part as a children's book writer.",8,0,0,18 December 2014
Shutter Island," Utter Hokum!!!
","Oscar-winning film director Martin Scorsese's latest movie 'Shutter Island' with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Mark Ruffalo, qualifies as his worst epic since 'Boxcar Bertha' in 1972. Mind you, Scorsese received an Academy Award finally in 2007 for his absorbing Bostonian undercover crime thriller 'The Departed.' Previously, he missed bagging the bronze statuette for 'Raging Bull' in 1981, 'The Last Temptation of Christ' in 1989, 'Goodfellas' in 1991, 'The Age of Innocence' in 1994, 'Gangs of New York' in 2003, and 'The Aviator' in 2005. Based on 'Mystic River' author Dennis Lehane's 2003 bestselling psycho-thriller, 'Shutter Island' constitutes a masterpiece of art direction, set design, cinematography, computer-generated special effects and top-notch acting. Nevertheless, you'll hate this gimmicky claptrap as soon as Scorsese and 'Alexander' scenarist Laeta Kalogridis trot out their mind-boggling eleventh hour revelation! Talk about getting the rug yanked out from under your feet! Indeed, Scorsese seems to be channeling Alfred Hitchcock of 'Vertigo' and 'North by Northwest' during the first half of this portentous two-hour and eighteen minute melodrama before he shifts gears and imitates director M. Night Shyamalan of 'The Village' in the last 20 minutes. Contrived and complicated from the start, this gloomy Gothic mystery thriller about a Houdini-like escape from a Federal maximum security asylum for the criminally insane, which resembles Alcatraz in Boston Harbor, is as delusional as a dog chasing its tail. Visually, 'Shutter Island' could pass muster if it had stuck to its fairly predictable police procedural plot. Unfortunately, Scorsese weaves quite a tale that takes some strange turns before the bottom falls out. People that hate movies about elaborate mind games that lead them by the nose through a maze and then surprise them with a bad ending won't enjoy 'Shutter Island.' Meantime, audiences scavenging for visceral shocks to chill themselves are going to be sorely disappointed.'Shutter Island' opens in 1954 in the Boston Harbor Islands as a storm is brewing offshore. Hard-boiled World War II veteran Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio of 'Titanic') and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo of 'The Last Castle') are U.S. Federal Deputy Marshals who have been assigned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an inmate patient at Ashecliffe Asylum. Ashecliffe occupies an island of its own, like Alcatraz Prison, and its terrain is both craggy and forbidding. A bald-headed, pipe-smoking Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley of 'Fifty Dead Men Walking') welcomes our gumshoe heroes to the island. Ashecliffe is more than an asylum; it is a hospital and a laboratory. Cawley lets Teddy and Chuck know from the start that he favors drugs over lobotomy. He struggles to bring moral order and peace to the troubled inmates, most of whom are murderers. Cawley has summoned the Marshals because a convicted psychopathic killer, Rachel (Emily Mortimer of 'The Pink Panther 2'), has vanished from her cell. Rachel is a murderess who drowned her three children. Deputy Warden McPherson (John Carroll Lynch of 'Grand Torino') has dozens of uniformed guards out turning over rocks while all this is transpiring. Teddy is just recovering from the voyage to the island. He suffers from seasickness. Cawley offers him aspirin. According to Cawley, when the attendant locked Rachel into his cell, he locked her in from the outside. When the Marshals scour Rachel's room, all they find is a cryptic note about 'the law of 4.' Moreover, Rachel left behind both pairs of shoes, and the terrain is far too treacherous for her to negotiate it without footwear. Deputy Warden McPherson points out that swimming under the current circumstances was out of the question. The currents would have driven her body back ashore. Meanwhile, Teddy and Chuck are livid with indignation when they learn Cawley let the doctor treating Rachel take his long overdue vacation at the genesis of an investigation. Essentially, Teddy and Chuck spend most of their time interrogating the doctors, the staff, and the patients. Teddy wants to scrutinize the personnel records of everybody that dealt with Rachel. Cawley refuses to open the books because the information is confidential. Initially, since neither senior psychotherapist Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow of 'The Seventh Seal') nor Cawley will allow Teddy to examine the personnel records. Eventually, Teddy discovers that Rachel could have slipped past one attendant when he went to the restroom. During their wanderings around the island, Teddy and Chuck get caught in a bad storm that forces Cawley and company to mobilize the staff and patients for an emergency. Our heroes wind up drenched to the skin, and Teddy resigns himself to staying on the island since the storm prevents their departure. 'Shutter Island' doesn't look as bad as its plot is. Scorsese creates a palatable sense of paranoia, and the atmosphere simmers with tension. Early long shots of the ferry penetrating a fog bank on its way to the island reminded me of the ship in 'King Kong' approaching Skull Island. Unfortunately, 'Shutter Island' simmers but never comes boils. Despite 'JFK' lenser Robert Richardson's incredibly flavorful cinematography and long-time Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker's brisk cutting, this film takes too long to unfold and its payoff doesn't equal the time spent conjuring it up. A major flaw for any Hollywood movie is the absence of a sympathetic hero for whom we can root. The Leonard DiCaprio protagonist may generate a modicum of sympathy, but he lacks charisma. Nobody in this movie is remotely likable, especially the eerie Dr. Naehring. Naehring and Teddy have an intimate moment in the hallway and Naehring gets a taste of his own medicine. Moments like that aren't enough to redeem this potboiler. Altogether, 'Shutter Island' amounts to utter hokum.",4,6,16,21 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The Sequel Surpasses the Original!!!
","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' gives super-hero sequels a good name. Not only is this $170 million blockbuster far better than its superb 'origins' predecessor, but it also is a real game-changer for the Marvel Universe. Former 'Fantastic Four' actor Chris Evans reprises the title role as Steve Rogers, a 90-pound weakling turned 240-pound heavyweight, whose exploits inspired millions in World War II. Remember Rogers spent about 70 years in suspended animation in an iceberg after he contributed to the defeat the Nazis as well as Hydra. Rogers maintains his sense of honor, or naivety, throughout all his trials and tribulations. Evans makes his old-fashioned, nice-guy antics appear both convincing and charming. Meaning, Captain America remains essentially a goody-two-shoes-bachelor-with-a-shield. Our hero takes a licking but keeps on ticking despite whatever adversaries he tangles with in the second, in-name-only theatrical 'Captain America' feature.Co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo of 'You, Me and Dupree' let the action coast occasionally in this larger-than-life, two-hour-and-sixteen minute melodrama, but the combat scenes are staged with so much kinetic artistry that you will teeter on the edge of your seat during them. Everything is still appropriately formulaic but entirely outlandish in the gravity-defying Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely screenplay that puts our hero early and often behind the eight ball. My favorite close-quarters combat encounter occurs in the elevator with our hero cornered and outnumbered. Later scraps on the three Helicarriers emerge as no less electrifying. Predictably, everything is business as usual, but the Russo brothers and their scribes provide enough twists and turns to keep you interested in this noisy nonsense. Mind you, one or two things won't register as total surprises because you know some characters cannot perish. Nevertheless, if you enjoyed the first 'Captain America' with Chris Evans, you will probably love the second one as much if not more! In terms of a chronological timeline, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' takes place two years after the cataclysmic New York showdown, but the action itself covers only three days. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) hasn't totally acclimated himself to the 21st century, but he refuses to let it interfere with his duty. While jogging around Washington, D.C., the fleet-footed Rogers befriends congenial Air Force flyboy Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie of 'Notorious') who counsels veterans suffering from PTSD at the VA Hospital. No sooner have they gotten acquainted than Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson of 'The Avengers') rolls up to whisk Rogers off onto his next dangerous mission. Later, Sam Wilson joins Rogers in his capacity as the winged hero Falcon. The first major action scene in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is designed to show how extraordinary our eponymous hero is under fire but also how vulnerable he remains. Terrorists have stormed a S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance ship, and they are issuing outrageous demands for the release of the hostages. Actually, this predicament reminded me of the first mission that Stallone and company embarked on in the initial 'Expendables' epic. Mind you, Captain America and his trusty boomerang shield clear the perimeter so Black Widow and Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo of 'End of Watch') can free the hostages and settle with the terrorists. However, more than meets the eye occurs during this seemingly simple mission, and Captain America confronts his superior, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nicholas Fury (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Pulp Fiction'), about Black Widow's cyber-exploit. No sooner have Rogers and Fury fussed at each other at the sprawling new island headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. than Fury briefs Rogers about the next best thing. Project Insight will link three Helicarriers via spy satellites and to eradicate preemptively any threats either domestic or otherwise. Naturally, Captain America doesn't like Insight. If he is shocked that things have changed so much that such a measure must be taken, he is even more shocked later when Fury shows up at his apartment with blood on his hands and an assassin lurking nearby. Of course, D.C. Police are nowhere to be found when these imposters do everything except blast holes in either the engine block or the tires of his fortified SUV during a tense auto chase through D.C. streets. If this weren't enough for Captain America, he must go toe-to-toe with a mysterious combatant with a 'Six Million Dollar Man' arm to save the day.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' makes several references to the previous film that strengthens its bond with it. We get a glimpse of the girl that Steve loved and we watch as Steve's best friend, Bucky Barnes, contends with amnesia. The filmmakers not only bring us up to date about Bucky, but also we learn more about renegade enemy scientist Dr. Arnim Zola who collaborated with the Red Skull in the first 'Captain America.' Furthermore, Zola opts to become a 'ghost-in-the machine' like Johnny Depp in 'Transcendence.' The Russos and their writers keep hurling obstacles into Captain America's path, and our hero doesn't have an easy time conquering the villains. Anthony Mackie gets to play the first African-American Marvel super hero, and he attacks the role with relish. He wears a sophisticated set of mechanical wings that enable him to fly and perform far-fetched feats. Scarlett Johansson is just as tough and sexy as she was in 'The Avengers.' Meanwhile, the best special effect in this special effects extravaganza isn't a special effect. Actor Robert Redford proves computer graphics stand no chance against the real thing. Redford qualifies as the most distinguished silver-screen good guy to cavort in such a dastardly manner since Henry Fonda in Sergio Leone's western 'Once Upon A Time in the West.' If you've never seen Redford in action, you owe it to yourself to check him out. By his presence alone, Redford makes this action-adventure opus into a memorable experience. Let's hope that Marvel Studios can keep up with good work with the forthcoming 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' in 2015.",10,24,35,21 April 2014
Over the Top," Father & Son Reunion Tearjerker with Stallone as the Dad
","'Over the Top' qualifies as one of Menahem Golan's better movies. This Sylvester Stallone arm wrestling saga casts the lean, muscular 'Rocky' hero as a humble but defiant trucker named Lincoln Hawk. Jason Cutler (Robert Loggia of 'Scarface'), Hawk's villainous father-in-law, who drove him out of his daughter's life will stoop to anything to get his way. Now, Cutler's daughter Christina (Susan Blakely of 'The Towering Inferno') is dying, but she wants her twelve-year old son, Michael (David Mendenhall), to get acquainted with her estranged husband. Naturally, the father-in-law doesn't take kindly to Hawk's intrusion. Cutler has been more of a father to Michael than Hawk could ever be over the last ten years. Meantime, when we aren't dealing with this contentious family custody battle, we find ourselves drawn into the world of arm wrestling. Hawk is hauling loads and working his way to the arm wrestling championship in Sin City. As a film, 'Over the Top' doubles not only as a father and son reunion tearjerker, but also as a sports themed fantasy about arm wrestling. Noted scenarist Stirling Silliphant of 'In the Heat of the Night,' and Stallone penned this thinly plotted but engaging chronicle. Appropriately enough, Stallone plays a 'Rocky' like underdog character, but it is Stallone at his most colorless. The road to reunion is pretty rocky for our protagonist and his long, lost son. Aside from Blakely's cameo from the hospital, 'Over the Top' doesn't dwell on romance. This is strictly a father-in-law versus his son-in-law epic with predictable but heartfelt results. Of course, Hawk and Michael come together in the long run, but they seem to be constantly at odds until the youngster discovers that his grandfather has been manipulating him from the start about Lincoln Hawk. Basically, Stallone doesn't perform any spectacular feats, and 'Over the Top' is believable. He steers an eighteen wheeler and arm wrestles. Stallone delivers a sincere performance and Loggia is believable as his antagonist every step of the way. When Hawk isn't tangling with Cutler, he competes with a number of colorful arm wrestler who look straight out of a heavy metal melodrama. The gorgeous scenery, 'Delta Force' lenser David Gurfinkel's cinematography, and Golan's polished direction bolster this lethargic but meaningful fodder. Golan does everything that he can to make the arm wrestling scenes appear intense with Sergio Leone-like choker-close-ups of the participants clenching their teeth and gritting it out.",7,0,1,30 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Another Marvel/Disney Masterpiece!!!
","'Dr. Strange' ranks as the best Walt Disney Studios and Marvel Comics' collaboration since 'Iron Man.' Mind you, I've confined myself strictly to the Disney/Marvel franchise and excluded the Marvel Comics/Twentieth Century Fox franchises: 'X-Men,' 'Deadpool,' and 'Daredevil.' Not only is director Scott Derrickson's sixth movie a dazzling example of bizarre superhero histrionics, but it also qualifies as a splendid origins epic in every respect. Wisely, Derrickson confines this supernatural masterpiece to 115 minutes without slighting any character or leaving any threads undone in its formulaic template. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly a revelation as Dr. Steven Strange, and his character follows quite an arc before the film concludes. Audiences should know that 'Dr. Strange' has two scenes before and after the end credits that are essential to the film. Steven Strange possesses an abrasive attitude, and 'Dr. Strange' adheres to the Disney/Marvel formula that originated with 'Iron Man.' Dr. Strange is just as arrogant as Tony Stark. These two prima donnas begin as ordinary humans with extraordinary gifts before hubris and bad luck combine to topple them from affluence. Similarly, they recover from these seemingly insurmountable ordeals with the incentive of a powerful mentor and emerge as larger-than-life titans. Unlike the colossal collateral damage that has highlighted virtually every Disney/Marvel movie to date, 'Dr. Strange' embraces an alternate strategy. This movie eschews the real world and lapses more often into the imaginary realm. The heroes don't destroy cities in their efforts to subjugate the villains as they have usually done in previous Disney/Marvel extravaganzas. Furthermore, Derrickson channels 'The Matrix' in the depiction of Dr. Strange's makeover as he learns about how to exist in different dimensions. Meantime, in its biggest departure from the Marvel comic book series, Derrickson and company have broken a tradition. They have cast Oscar winning actress Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One who introduces Strange to the wondrous mysteries of the mind. In the comics, the Ancient One was a guy rather than a girl. 'Dr. Strange' serves not only as a sensational Marvel Comics adaptation but also as commentary on a national epidemic of distracted driving that has swept the country since the advent of cell phones. Protagonist Dr. Stephen Strange (Oscar nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch of 'The Imitation Game') is an eminent, world-renowned surgeon who has achieved unparalleled feats with his hands. As he is searching for his next surgical triumph, Strange is careening along a swerving mountain-side highway without a care in the world. He has his phone switched on in his sleek sports car and it debating to accept a new patient when he loses control of his vehicle, smashes into another car, and flies off the highway like a UFO, and crashes miles below in obscurity. When he awakens after surgery, he finds his hands permanently mangled. Repeated surgeries gain him nothing, and gifted surgeons like he once was refuse to take his case for fear of ruining their track records. Eventually, Strange spends so much money than he loses virtually everything he had acquired, and he loses the woman that he loved the most, Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams of 'The Vow'), who refuses to have anything to do with her after he insults her. Later, during his rehab, Strange alienates his rehab therapist. The therapist tells Strange about a similar man, Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Pratt of 'The Infiltrator'), who triumphed over his limitations. Strange is shocked to learn that this patient recovered from an impossible spinal injury that nobody has conquered. Desperate to know how Pangborn accomplished this unheard-of feat, Strange accepts Pangborn's advice and travels to a monastery in Nepal. Strange blows the rest of his dwindling funds and approaches the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) in the mountains. She shows him familiar pictures of the human body, and Strange accuses her of being a quack until she knocks him out of his body into an entirely different dimension. Performing an about-face, Strange humbles himself before her as he plumbs the depths of his mind that he never thought probable. Although he never recovers his long-sought after manual dexterity, he becomes a different person who can alter time and space. Little does he realize that the mystical world that he has entered has been traveled by others who endeavor to exploit their new-found power to destroy the world. Along the way, he establishes his identity as Dr. Strange, not as Mr. Strange or Master Strange. Like all memorable Marvel movies, 'Dr. Strange' sacrifices the life of one of its primary characters to endow the film with a sense of depth. 'Sinister' director Derrickson, 'Prometheus' scribe Jon Spaihts, and 'Sinister' franchise writer C. Robert Cargill have created a thoroughly entertaining film fraught with nuance and detail. The villains are smart, strong, and resourceful adversaries that look truly malevolent. The villains are interesting but never sympathetic, and 'Casino Royale' villain Mads Mikkelsen is perfectly cast as the leader. The titular hero must endure trial after trial before he acquires his unique powers as Dr. Strange. Like any worthwhile superhero saga, 'Dr. Strange' puts the fate of the world at stake, and our resilient hero must contend with enemies far more formidable than he until he masters his skills as a sorcerer and defeats them. Derrickson and his writers have forged believable, sympathetic characters that we care about. 'Dr. Strange' amounts to an enjoyable load of hokum embellished with mind-boggling visuals. When the heroes and villains tangle, they create worlds within worlds to stage their Armageddon-style showdowns without endangering the rest of humanity. The sight of cityscapes folding up like accordions is nothing short of spectacular. If you've seen the Leonardo DiCaprio thriller 'Inception,' the sprawling cityscapes behave in similar fashion as our heroes battle to control the arena with the bad guys. You may figure out who decides to give up their life to ensure the safety of future generations. Provocatively, fadeout at the end doesn't necessarily guarantee the triumph of good over evil.",10,3,10,12 December 2016
Interstellar," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece
","Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. 'Inception' director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza 'Interstellar,' toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, 'Interstellar' doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored 'Guardians of the Galaxy' aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the 'Star Wars' and 'Hunger Games' franchises. Instead, the 'Interstellar' scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, 'Interstellar' qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as '2001.' The casts of 'Interstellar' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while 'Interstellar' boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen '2001: A Space Odyssey,' you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen '2001' will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious '2001' references in 'Interstellar' are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. 'Interstellar' occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of 'Mud'), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of 'Worse Friends'), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of 'The Conjuring') who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of 'Terms of Endearment'), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like 'Paranormal Activity.' Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of 'Batman Begins'), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of 'Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of 'The Hunger Games'); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of 'Interstellar' will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! 'Interstellar' is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout 'Interstellar.' The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout 'Interstellar.' Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, 'Interstellar' amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending.",10,3,10,25 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Not Up To Kubrick's Usual Brilliance
","'Dr. Strangelove' director Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' qualifies a cynical, blistering, and profane expose of the U.S. Marine Corps, its dehumanizing mentality, and the amoral experience of the Vietnam War. Sadly, despite the talent involved, 'Full Metal Jacket' doesn't eviscerate the Vietnam War with either the same intensity or insight as either Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' or Michael Cimino's 'The Deer Hunter.' The cast consists of unknown newcomers, including Mathew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dorian Harwood, Arliss Howard, John Terry, and Ed O'Ross. D'Onofrio delivers the best performance as a crazy recruit, while former Drill Sergeant R.L. Emery steals the show. His dialogue and use of rampant profanity will stick in your mind long after this film fades. Kubrick makes good use of the Nancy Sinatra tune 'These Boots Were Made for Walking.'Taking Gustav Hasford's minor novel 'The Short Timers,' Kubrick penned the screenplay with Hasford and Michael Herr. The first 45 minutes takes place on Parris Island in a Marine Boot Camp where a Looney tunes drill sergeant subjects his raw recruits to the worst that he can dish and turns into killers. Indeed, the first scene shows the principal actors for the Boot Camp scene getting their heads shaved clean in a barber shop. The second half occurs in Vietnam before the Tet Offensive. Amazingly, Kubrick—because he hated to leave England—lensed the entire film on location in England. Unfortunately, the riveting first half at Parris Island overshadows the second half in Vietnam, and the film concludes rather lamely with a drawn-out sequence involving a female sniper who pins down our heroes in an urban setting. Incidentally, as surprising as it is when she is revealed as the sniper, it is interesting to note that Private Joker (Mathew Modine) foreshadows this revelation as the outset of the Vietnam sequence when he observes that NVA officers are sometimes women. Several memorable scenes occur in the Vietnam sequence, particularly when Private Joker questions the helicopter gunship gunner how he can kill women and children. His response that he leads them more is ghoulish. Private Joker's run in with a high ranking officer about his helmet plastered with stickers is funny, too. The soundtrack boasts several Top 40 hits from the era that fit in with the storyline, especially Nancy Sinatra's 'These Boots Are Made For Walking.'What a letdown for Kubrick.",7,3,5,12 June 2009
Pacific Rim," Massive Monster Mash
","'Hellboy' director Guillermo del Toro and scenarist Travis Beacham have caught Michael Bay and his 'Transformers' franchise napping with the release of 'Pacific Rim.' This entertaining but formulaic nonsense amalgamates science fiction with horror in an apocalyptic adventure epic that pits humans piloting giant robots against 'Godzilla' type monsters from another universe. Imagine 'Godzilla' meets 'Robot Jox,' and you'll have a good idea what to anticipate from 'Pacific Rim.' When you aren't laughing yourself silly at the doomsday premise of mankind tangling with alien behemoths from another galaxy, you may find yourself caught up in the bombastic, larger-than-life action. Basically, 'Pacific Rim' amounts to a slug fest between towering robots and amphibious leviathans that attack each other on both land and sea. Just because you haven't swamped a bathtub lately with a rubbery ducky in one fist and a huge plastic robot in the other doesn't mean that you won't enjoy this boisterous Armageddon. Comparatively, between the heroic humans and the 'Jurassic Park' influenced monsters, del Toro creates more urban destruction than both 'The Avengers' and 'Man of Steel.' Skyscrapers topple like dominos, and gigantic creatures rampage through a number of largely populated Pacific rim properties like tornadoes. In the hands of a talent lesser than del Toro, who also helmed 'Blade 2,' 'Pacific Rim' might not have been so amusing. The film's biggest asset isn't the impressive CGI gargantuan combatants, but its cheeky sense of humor. Meantime, the biggest problem this outlandish epic contends with is its largely unknown cast. Aside from veterans like Ron Pearlman and Idris Elba, who support rather than lead, nobody qualifies as a celebrity superstar. Charlie Hunnam has made one above-average thriller 'Deadfall' and appeared in 70 episodes of 'Sons of Anarchy' as Jackson 'Jax' Teller. Anybody who liked Steve McQueen will notice a stunning resemblance between Hunnam and the 'Bullitt' star. Hunnam has all of McQueen's physical movements down, but his hair looks a mite long. Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi plays Hunnam's feisty co-star, and they wind up sharing more than merely physical space in this rock 'em sock 'em yarn. The beauty of unknowns in a mega-budget movie like 'Pacific Rim' is that you're never certain whose going to survive.This fast-paced, live-wire, sci-fi spectacle takes place about seven years from now in 2020. The worst thing that we face as a society then isn't suicidal terrorists. Instead, it's the Kaiju — massive, dinosaur-like, creatures from another dimension that emerge from a breach in the ocean floor to stomp the smithereens out of San Francisco, Manila and Cabo San Lucas. Initially, mankind tried to use conventional weapons on these supernatural mega-beasts. Unfortunately, more powerful weapons were required to repulse these pugnacious leviathans. All the scenes with the monsters trashing cities will evoke memories of the original Japanese Godzilla movies as well as the 1998 American remake with Matthew Broderick. Eventually, mankind cooperates on a global basis and constructs huge, 25-foot high, humanoid metal com-bots with cannons and lasers called Jaegers. Two pilots in tandem operate these man-made monsters with each acting as opposing neural hemispheres. Like the monsters, the Jaegers can 'take a licking and keep on ticking' in the drink as well as on land. The pilots wear space suits, wield their two minds as one in 'Star Trek' mind-meld fashion, and control their robot from a sophisticated Wii platform built into the head-piece of the hulk. Two pilots are required because a Jaeger because one pilot cannot perform the tasks required without suffering long-term side-effects. When these robots are being prepared for combat, the pilots must establish a neural link between their minds so their memories and consciousness are bonded together by inboard hardware. As it turns out, Earth succeeds in repulsing their creatures. Nevertheless, the Kaiju haven't tossed in the celestial towel. They come back for one last fracas, and the best of the Jaegers confront them in a life and death battle in the north Alaskan Seas. Brothers Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff of 'After Earth') and Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) wade into icy waters against the orders of their superior, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba of 'Thor'), to save a fishing vessel from the Kaiju. This Kaiju has a surprise in store for them when it rips the head-piece off the Jaeger and pulls Raleigh's brother Yancy out. Stunned and injured during the toe-to-toe fray, Raleigh manages to bring the Jaeger home and quits the program. He is a hull of his former self now that his brother is gone. The Jaeger program isn't far from extinct itself. The powers that be have decided that walls are the answer to the Kaiju. Every metropolis on the Pacific rim sets out to erect impenetrable walls. Unfortunately, nobody told the Kaiju and they smash through these immense walls like a blow torch through butter. Stacker searches for Raleigh and finds him toiling on a wall. Later, he introduces him to Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), and they assure Raleigh that he can drive another Jaeger. Stacker's scientists, Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day of 'Horrible Bosses') and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman of 'Layer Cake'), are furiously working on ways to destroy these creatures when Mako announces she is the ideal candidate to help Raleigh operate a Jaeger. Stacker is initially hesitant to let her to double team with Raleigh in a Jaeger, but she wins him over to her side.'Pacific Rim' boasts more than just a bunch of robots battling prehistoric looking monsters. Charlie Day steals the show as an insane scientist who looks like Christian Slater crossed with Rick Moranis and brays like a jackass. Burn Gorman and he have a field day playing psychotic scientists. At one point, Dr. Geiszler decides to mind-meld with a fragment of a Kaiju's brain and realizes that Stacker's strategy of using a Jaeger to drop a nuclear device down the Pacific Ocean portal from where the monsters come isn't going to work. 'Pacific Rim' is a monster of a mash.",8,3,10,20 July 2013
American Sniper," Commanding Stuff!!!
","In his gritty, 132 minute, R-rated, combat biography 'American Sniper,' producer & director Clint Eastwood treats the life of real-life protagonist Chris Kyle with unmistakable reverence. This tragic but heroic account of the deadliest sharpshooter in U.S. military history is compelling as well as propelling from fade-in to fade-out. Similarly, 'A-Team' actor Bradley Cooper delivers a career best performance as the legendary Texas native who racked up 160 confirmed kills as a sniper during four tours of duty in Iraq. Cooper packed on nearly 40 pounds so he could impersonate the beefy Kyle, and the actor assured 'Men's Health' magazine that the 6000 calories-per-day diet that he shoveled down constituted a challenge in itself. According to 'People' magazine, real-life Navy SEAL sniper Kevin Lacz, who fought alongside Kyle, taught Cooper how to handle the sophisticated sniper weaponry. This sober but never simple-minded saga about the Iraqi war doesn't so much ponder the polemical politics that prompted America's participation in the fighting as much as its use as a historical setting. Indeed, Kyle was gung-ho about serving his country after suicide bombers had blasted the Marine barracks to rubble in Beirut in 1983. Meantime, people who have read Kyle's 2012 memoir may complain about some of the liberties that Eastwood and 'Paranoia' scenarist Jason Hall have taken in their adaptation of the New York Times bestseller. Nevertheless, Eastwood has fashioned a realistic but patriotic film with a wrinkle or two that has mesmerized domestic audiences. For example, Kyle believed in what he was doing in Iraq while his younger brother abhorred not only the war but also the country. Eastwood celebrates the sacrifices that these citizens made without turning 'American Sniper' into a rabble-rousing, Rambo fantasy.'American Sniper' opens in Iraq with Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) sprawled belly down on a Fallujah roof-top checking potential threats to the Marines on the street below as they rattle one door after another in search of hostiles. Initially, Kyle spots a military-age, Iraqi native on a balcony. Chatting on a cell phone, he is watching the troops approach him. This suspicious fellow vanishes from Kyle's sight. Moments later, a mother dressed like an angel of death in black emerges onto the street with her son. The mother hands her son a grenade, and they approach a tank with troops following it. Just as Kyle is scrutinizing these two civilians through his sniper scope, his spotter warns him that he could land in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth for shooting friendly civilians. This issue arises more than once in 'American Sniper.' Civilians in combat zones without a good reason created a quandary because our guys couldn't be sure who was either sympathetic or unfriendly. Anyway, as Kyle caresses the trigger of his sniper rifle, Eastwood flashbacks to Kyle's life as a Texas teen shooting his first deer. Eastwood and Hall furnish us with a montage of Kyle's life along with his God-fearing father's philosophy. We see Kyle rush to the rescue of his younger brother Jeff on the playground at their elementary school as an obese bully beats up Jeff. At the dinner table, Kyle's stern father Wayne (Ben Reed of 'Scanner Cop') categorizes humans into three types: predatory wolves, sheep, and sheepdogs. Brandishing his rolled up belt for emphasis, Wayne warns them that they will neither be predators nor sheep, but instead sheepdogs. Wayne promises to punish them for anything less. During his military service, Chris behaves like a sheepdog. Repeatedly, he risks his life to save his fellow Marines. Occasionally, 'American Sniper' lightens up and lets you laugh with Chris about his romantic conquests both good and bad.Aside from a protracted flashback sequence early into the action, 'American Sniper' adheres to a conventional, straightforward storyline, chronicling the high points of Kyle's experiences under fire. Comparatively, director Peter Berg's 'Lone Survivor' (2013), starring Mark Wahlberg, could serve as a companion piece to 'American Sniper.' The big difference is Bradley Cooper's SEAL team hero displays no compunctions about shooting kids, whereas Mark Wahlberg's real-life SEAL team hero Marcus Luttrell couldn't bring himself to kill an innocent goat herder's son. Meanwhile, 'American Sniper' alternates between our hero's harrowing battlefield exploits and his home front activities with his wife and family. Eastwood doesn't immortalize Chris Kyle as an invincible, larger-than-life, titan. Actually, we watch in horror as Kyle unravels with each tour until he can no longer tolerate the traumatic pressure of combat. In this respect, 'American Sniper' doesn't pull any punches about the caliber of warfare that our guys had to contend with in Iraq. Mind you, it isn't gripping in the same slam-bang sense that 'Black Hawk Down' was, but 'American Sniper' still qualifies as a tour-de-force, first-rate, action yarn. I don't think Bradley Cooper will clinch the Best Actor Oscar, but you will know that Cooper takes his craft seriously. Aside from Cooper, the only other three-dimensional, flesh-and-blood character is Kyle's long-suffering wife, Taya (British actress Sienna Miller of 'Foxcatcher'), who goes toe-to-toe with him.Primarily, Eastwood filters everything through Kyle's perspective, and you don't witness any of those standard-issue scenes with natty politicians and high-ranking officers arguing about strategy at headquarters. Eastwood rarely shifts the focus away from either Kyle with his family or Kyle with his buddies. Of course, Kyle and his buddies form a tightly knit group from their rigorous beachfront SEAL team training to the devastating combat in Iraq. Predictably, warfare dwindles their numbers. Particularly shattering is Kyle's loss of his buddy Biggles (Jake McDorman of 'Aquamarine') who survives long enough to die in surgery. The camaraderie between Kyle and Biggles is sometimes hilarious as well as distressing. Kyle's younger brother Jeff (Keir O'Donnell of 'Wedding Crashers') drifts into and out of the action. Jeff accompanies Kyle on the rodeo circuit in Texas and later follows him to the battlefield in Iraq. Altogether, 'American Sniper' ranks as a memorable military actioneer with some salty dialogue.",10,20,44,26 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'Star Wars: Episode Two: Attack of the Clones' rewards audiences
","Writer & director George Lucas takes more chances in 'Star Wars: Episode Two: Attack of the Clones' than he has since his first sequel 'The Empire Strikes Back' in 1980. The second prequel in the popular Twentieth Century Fox film franchise surpasses the adolescent antics of 'Episode One,' but defies expectations. First, Lucas and co-scenarist Jonathan Hales of 'The Scorpion King' weave a darker, thematically richer, far more elaborate tale of deception and intrigue. Second, the stormy relationships between Jedi wannabe Anakin Skywalker (newcomer Hayden Christensen whose striking resemblance to James Dean adds to his stature), his Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor of 'Trainspotting'), and Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman of 'The Professional') lack both the usual charisma and warmth. Third, while some 'Star Wars' fans may rank 'Episode One' above 'Episode Two,' the latter neither panders to instant gratification nor glib evasions of moral obligations as in 'Spider-man.' New characters bristle with greater ambiguity, and a serviceable storyline contains enough surprises. For the record, 'Episode Two' occurs ten years after 'Episode One.' During that decade, Obi-Wan has instructed hot-tempered Anakin in the ways of a Jedi knight. Senator Amidala, previously the Queen of Naboo, lands on the planet Coruscant to address the Republic about the political unrest in the galaxy. Predictably, assassins line up to kill Amidala. Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Fresh') appoints Obi-Wan and Anakin to serve as her bodyguards. Basically, 'Episode Two' begins as a mystery thriller, and then chronicles Anakin's forbidden romance with Amidala on Naboo and his tragic descent to the Dark Side.Obi-Wan's relentless pursuit of bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temeura Morrison) leads him to a rain swept planet when he discovers a secret clone army. Meanwhile, Anakin and Amidala sneak off to Tatooine, where Anakin's emotions overwhelm him during his search for his mother.Lucas and Hales clone scenes from their favorite films as well as previous 'Star Wars' extravaganzas. Anakin's exploits with his mom's captors resemble the classic John Wayne western 'The Searchers' (1956), while an attempt on Amidala's life recalls a similar incident in the first James Bond epic 'Dr. No' (1963). Clocking in at two hours plus, this far-fetched, formulaic fantasy piles on so much exposition (info you don't know about the plot) that you need a legal pad to alleviate confusion. Sadly, Lucas lets these loquacious interludes linger longer than necessary, but he redeems himself with several acrobatic, gravity-defying, light-saber combat duels featuring some unlikely participants.Pictorially stunning alternative world as well as the ingeniously orchestrated action that foreshadows the outcome of the original trilogy make this outing not only entertaining but also off-beat for a summer release. 'Star Wars: Episode Two: Attack of the Clones' rewards audiences with dazzling state-of-the-art digital special effects, gladiatorial combat with monstrous beasts, and the incomparable Christopher Lee (the Hammer Studios' 'Dracula') as the sinister Count Dooku. Indeed, he registers his presence strongly. Altogether, while the long-winded dialogue scenes slow down the action, George Lucas manages to strike an agreeable balance in 'Episode Two' between the merchandising and the melodrama.",8,0,1,8 March 2008
Forrest Gump," A Brilliant Comedy of Epic Proportions
","'Back to the Future' trilogy director Robert Zemeckis surpassed himself in ways that he probably never imagined when he made 'Forrest Gump.' Clocking in at two hours and forty minutes, this PG-13 rated comedy about the epic misadventures of a slow-witted dolt from rural Alabama with a below-average I.Q. who lives through several milestone events in the 1960s received the Oscar for Best Picture of 1994. Not only did Zemeckis earn a Best Director Oscar, but also Tom Hanks' took home the Academy statuette for Best Actor with his insightful, down-to-earth thesping. Forrest Gump is not the brightest bulb in the grid, but Hanks conveys this quality without ever stooping to histrionics. Above all, Hanks delivers a performance that has innocence and dignity intertwined. Moreover, 'Forrest Gump' qualifies as Hanks' best film.'Forrest Gump' unfolds in Savannah, Georgia, as the eponymous character narrates the story of his life in a number of flashbacks. Indeed, two-thirds of the action takes place with Forrest on the bench relating his exploits to other people waiting for their bus. The first time that we see young Forrest, he has just been fitted with a pair of leg braces at the doctor's office while his mother (Sally Fields of 'Norma Ray') watches. She is determined to see to it that father-less Forrest gets to live as normal a life as possible. The school principal (Sam Anderson of 'La Bamba') fails to convince her that Forrest's low I.Q. of 75 means that he should not attend regular school classes. Despite Forrest's intellectual's shortcomings, Mrs. Gump persuades the principal to permit Forrest to enroll in normal classes by having loud, noisy sex with him. The next time that we see young Forrest (newcomer Michael Humphreys) he hesitates about climbing aboard the school bus because he doesn't know the bus driver and has been warned by his mother not to accept rides from strangers. The driver and Forrest introduce themselves to each other and he steps aboard because they are now no longer strangers. Forrest meets his first best friend Jenny Curran when she is the only student riding the bus who will let him sit beside her. Later, Forrest meets his second best friend on his way to military boot camp when Bubba makes room for him to sit beside him after others have turned him away.Jenny and Forrest cultivate their friendship to the point that other students decide to attack Forrest. Initially, these obnoxious kids throw rocks at Forrest while he is walking home with Jenny. 'Run, Forrest, run,' screams Jenny to our hero as the kids hurl more rocks and pursue him on their bicycles. Forrest takes off running and his braces disintegrate and he breaks into a loping stride that the kids on their bikes cannot match. The first chronological transition from young Forrest to Tom Hanks as Forrest occurs when the same kids—only older—attack Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright of 'The Princess Bride') and try to run him down in their pick-up truck. Again, Forrest outruns them and scrambles through a practice scrimmage that Alabama football coach Bear Bryant (Sonny Shroyer of 'Gator') is holding. Forrest winds up in college, joins the football and scores touchdowns for the Alabama Crimson Tide. During his stay at Alabama, Forrest is exposed to the famous stance in the doorway by real-life Alabama governor George Wallace when the University of Alabama was integrated by African-American students. As one of the black students is entering the school, she drops a book and Forrest retrieves it on camera. Later, Forrest visits the White House, drinks 15 Dr. Pepper sodas, and gets to shake hands with the real President John F. Kennedy.Meanwhile, Jenny has grown up, left her abusive father to live with another person, and ends up in an all-girls' school. Forrest shows up and beats up Jenny's date because he thinks that the guy is getting rough with her. Jenny gives Forrest his first sexual experience. She cups his hand over her breast and he blows a gasket while Jenny's roommate—apparently asleep—listens in horror as Forrest admits that he has messed up the roommate's bathrobe. Jenny informs Forrest that she wants to become a folk singer like her idol Joan Baez. Forrest joins the U.S. Army and takes a furlough to Memphis, Tennessee, to see Jenny perform folk songs on stage. Forrest knows that Jenny got expelled from her college for posing nude in a 'Girls of the South' issue of Playboy magazine, but he isn't prepared for what he sees when she performs in the nude singing a Bob Dylan song. When a spectator heckles Jenny, Forrest comes to her rescue.Significantly, the film pioneered some revolutionary techniques, such as inserting a live actor into historic archival footage of important events as well as enabling Oscar nominated actor Gary Sinise to appear convincing as a handicapped Vietnam veteran who has lost both legs in combat. If the structure of 'Forrest Gump' is reminiscent of David Fincher's recent opus 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,' this is no surprise because Eric Roth penned scripts for both 'Forrest Gump' as well as 'Benjamin Button.' Roth got an Oscar for his adaptation of Winston Groom's novel. Not surprisingly, 'Forrest Gump' was awarded Oscars for best visual effects. Interestingly, Paramount Pictures produced this film for $55-million dollars and coined over $600 million dollars from it domestically as well as internationally.",10,3,5,1 November 2009
Ant-Man," Antastic!
","The Marvel Comics Universe keeps getting bigger and more spectacular with each appearance of 'The Avengers,' 'Iron Man,' 'Captain America,' 'Thor,' 'The Fantastic Four,' 'X-Men,' 'Wolverine,' and 'The Guardians of the Galaxy.' Consequently, it comes with a sigh of relief that the latest newcomer, 'Ant-Man' (**** OUT OF ****), shrinks from such apocalyptic pretensions. 'Bring It On' director Peyton Reed, who replaced British writer & director Edgar Wright, has helmed what could possibly be the most imaginative as well as the atypical superhero saga of the summer. Miniaturization is the cornerstone of this clever little yarn. Mind you, nobody can completely appreciate 'Ant-Man' who hasn't seen director Jack Arnold's seminal science-fiction feature 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' (1957) where an unfortunate fellow--through no fault of his own--found himself reduced to the size of a toothpick and tangled with predatory house cats while taking refuge in a child's doll house. Similarly, the next major movie to magnify shrinkage, director Richard Fleischer's 'Fantastic Voyage' (1966), scaled down scientists to microscopic dimensions and injected them into a comatose scientist's bloodstream to save him from a lethal blood clot. Appropriately, television capitalized on all things minuscule with Irwin Allen's 'Land of the Giants' (1968-1970) where the crew and passengers of the Spindrift, a commercial sub-orbital transport spaceship, traveled into treacherous outer space turbulence and then crashed on an unknown planet. Everything loomed twelve times larger on this peculiar planet than anything on Earth making for 51 exciting episodes. Of course, other honorable mentions include the Dennis Quaid comedy 'Innerspace' (1987) and the Rick Moranis farce 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' (1989).'Ant-Man' opens in 1989. Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) hands Howard Stark (John Slattery of 'Iron Man 2') his resignation and leaves the espionage, law-enforcement, and counterterrorism agency SHIELD. Naturally, Stark regrets Pym's departure. Pym exits because SHIELD went behind his back and endeavored to duplicate the Pym Particle with his Ant-Man shrinking-suit technology. Pym lost his wife while during his experiments with that technology, and he deems it is far too dangerous for anybody to trifle with. 'As long as I am alive,' proclaims Pym, 'nobody is ever going to get that formula.' This early scene fascinates because the filmmakers have given actor Michael Douglas an incredible, computerized, makeover so he appears twenty years or younger. For the record, Hollywood has altered some of the Marvel Comics canon. In the comics, Pym—not Tony Stark and Bruce Banner—originally created the villainous Ultron, who menaced our heroic quintet in 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron.' Meanwhile, the years have not kind to Pym. After he exited SHIELD, he formed his own company, Pym Technologies. Sadly, Pym's evil protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll of 'The Bourne Legacy'), has seized control and feverishly schemes to replicate the prized Pym Particle. Ironically enough, Hank's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly of 'Lost'), appears to be working in league with the treacherous Cross.Meantime, idealistic thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) leaves San Quentin after serving a three-year stretch for burglary. Actually, Scott qualifies as the most sympathetic ex-con in cinematic history. Since he divorced his wife Maggie (Judy Greer of 'Jurassic World') but hasn't paid a penny of child support, Scott cannot visit his adorable daughter, Cassie (newcomer Abby Ryder Fortson), who misses him as much as he misses her. Not only does Maggie stonewall Scott, so does her smarmy fiancé, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale of 'Spy'), who happens to be a cop. Reluctantly, Scott boards with his former cellmate, Luis (a scene-stealing Michael Peña of 'Fury'), who lures him back into a life of crime. Scott struggled to go straight, even landed a job at Baskin-Robbins, but his boss learned about this prison record and fired him. Desperate to make child support money, Scott resorts to his burglary skills. He breaks into none other than Hank Pym's house and steals an exotic helmet and suit. Later, he discovers the outfit enables him to shrink to ant size and enhance his fighting prowess. 'Second chances don't come around all that often,' Pym warns Scott. 'This is your chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are.' Scott joins Hank in an outlandish plan to prevent the megalomaniacal Cross from selling the Pym Particle to SHIELD's nemesis HYDRA. Silly, superficial, and preposterous, 'Ant-Man' delivers scores of hilarious, but suspenseful shenanigans. Until Marvel/Disney released 'Ant-Man,' Hollywood had ignored all things petite in pursuit of the big, the bigger, and the biggest in its blockbusters. Meantime, the ever creative intellects at Marvel had been planning an 'Ant-Man' movie since 'Shaun of the Dead' director Edgar Wright had embarked on the project about a decade ago. Creative differences forced Wright out, and Reed took over the helm. Now, 'Ant-Man' has emerged as the revelation of the summer, rather like the goofy 'Guardians of the Galaxy' did last summer. From concept to casting, everything about this mighty mite of a movie is nothing short of brilliant. Consistently entertaining on all levels, 'Ant-Man' plumbs new depths in the superhero genre and provides former superstar Michael Douglas with his best role since director David Fincher's 1997 thriller 'The Game.' Romantic comedy leading man Paul Rudd of 'Role Models' is the last guy you'd imagine as the diminutive Marvel hero. Nevertheless, the self-deprecatory Rudd succeeds with a combination of panache and charisma. He is a funny guy who doesn't try to be funny and comes off being even funnier. Like the eponymous creepy-crawlies that can tote ten times their body weight, 'Ant-Man' delivers ten times more entertainment than most superhero sagas despite its downsized spectacle. Not surprisingly, this origins opus covers the roughly same ground that 'Iron Man' did, but it does so with greater creativity on a considerably smaller scale. Clearly, those pests that habitually ruin your picnics have undergone a massive publicity campaign that places them as well as formulaic superheroes in an entirely different perspective.Altogether, 'Ant-Man' is antastic!",10,2,10,21 July 2015
21 Jump Street," So Stupid, It Slapsticks You!!!
","Anybody who watched the straight-faced Johnny Depp television cop series '21 Jump Street' (1987 thru 1992) probably won't appreciate the low-brow, comedic, big-screen adaptation co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Incredibly enough, co-directors Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, who went on the helm the hilariously funny 'The Lego Movie,' called the,shots on this lowest-common denominator parody. 'Project X' scenarist Michael Bacall and an uncredited Jonah Hill scrape the bottom of the barrel for humor in this relentlessly-profane, R-rated comedy that is hopelessly far-fetched when it isn't completely infantile. The best thing about '21 Jump Street' is the wacky bromance that Parks and Miller made out of this comedy.Our two heroes were enemies in high school before they joined the Metropolitan City Police. Schmidt (Jonah Hill of 'Superbad') and Jenko (Channing Tatum of 'White House Down')wind up becoming best buddies at the police academy and lend each other a hand to graduate in their areas of expertise. Schmidt is the nerd who chokes when he asks for a date to prom, while Jenko is the jock with no practical knowledge. Eventually, they find themselves assigned to patrol a park on bicycles. After they arrest their first suspect but forget to advise him about his Miranda rights, their commander, Deputy Chief Hardy (Ned Offerman of 'Wristcutters: A Love Story') transfers them to an undercover narcotics operation at 21 Jump Street. Naturally, it has become a Hollywood cliché that the actors and actresses cast as teens are far too old for those roles. The same holds true for both Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. They no more look like they could infiltrate the ranks of a high school than they could masquerade as newborns in the maternity ward. Several times throughout their undercover operation, the high school student observe that they appear too old for school. Nevertheless, Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko enter high school and struggle to blend in with the other students. Eventually, our dim-witted heroes stumble onto the drug dealers in high school selling the synthetic H.F.S., but they aren't racking up one bust after another like their counterparts in other undercover operations. The first time that they meet the student on the inside, the guy forces them to take the drug in front of him. Our heroes do everything possible to stop from taking the drug, but they realize that if they don't, they will blow their cover. Ironically, our heroes aren't deemed trustworthy until they make utter buffoons of themselves during the Peter Pan school play.Most of the humor is borderline slapstick, and the action scenes are pretty tame. The car swapping stunt that they do in gridlock traffic is amusing. Ice Cube is hilarious as our heroes' loud-mouth superior who uses profanity at the least provocation. The scene that is most gross occurs near the end when they expose the man behind the narcotics ring at school. Jenko catches a bullet in the shoulder, while Schmidt shoots off the drug dealer's penis. His hands zip-tied behind his back, the villain gets on his knees and picks up his severed member in his mouth. The basic plot has our heroes tangling with the same drug dealers that they dealt with in the park. Lord and Miller skewer all the clichés, not only the standard procedural clichés, but also some others. When was the last time that a remake killed the two heroes of the television show?",6,1,2,17 June 2014
Bridget Jones's Diary," Don't Miss 'Bridget Jones's Diary!'
","This delightfully funny British import from the guys who gave us 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994) combines the best elements of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' with the classic fairy tale favorite 'Cinderella.' Bestselling author Helen Fleming, who penned the phenomenal 1996 novel of the same name, wrote the screenplay with ex-boyfriend Richard ('Notting Hill') Curtis and Andrew (the BBC's 'Pride and Prejudice') Davies. This saucy romantic chick flick with its unconventional heroine, clever slapstick farce, witty charismatic cast, predictable happy ending, and relentlessly self-depreciating British humor qualifies as the best chubby girl comedy since the 1966 ugly duckling English romp 'Georgy Girl' headlining a plump Lynn Redgrave. Texas native Renee Zellweger of 'Jerry Maguire' adopts a serviceable British accent and captures the klutzy charm of the eponymous 32-year old West London bachelorette torn between her womanizing boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant of 'Mickey Blue Eyes') and divorced human rights barrister Mark Darcy (Colin Firth of 'Shakespeare in Love'). As comparisons go, 'Bridget Jones's Diary resembles a funnier, more down-to-earth, big-screen version of TV's 'Friends.' 'Diary' chronicles our neurotic but sympathetic, size twelve, London office girl's year-long efforts to discover love and happiness. The vetty British soap operatic action opens one snowy Christmas. Bridget resolves to lose twenty pounds, to stop chain-smoking, to stop bingeing on chocolate, and to stop swilling Chardonnay at home alone while warbling the lyrics to Eric Carmen's 'All By Myself.' In an ironic voice over, poor Bridget muses, 'Unless I changed my life, I was destined to die alone and be found three weeks later, half-eaten by Alsatians. Bridget sets about entering her current weight as well as cigarette and alcohol use in a daily diary. At the same time, she vows with mock conviction to find a 'nice, sensible boyfriend to go out with' and refuses 'to form romantic attachments to any of the following: alcoholics, workaholics, commitment phobic's, peeping Toms, megalomaniacs' and so forth. No sooner has Bridget made such pretentious pledges than she finds herself dating Daniel Cleaver and flirting with the scoundrel at the office via e-mail. Meanwhile, Bridget's well-meaning but intrusive parents introduce her to another eligible bachelor, Mark Darcy, at their Christmas party.Bridget and Mark get off on the wrong foot. She overhears Mark call her a 'verbally incontinent spinster.' Later, Daniel reveals that Mark stole his previous girlfriend. Bridget's dislike for Mark mounts. The conflict reaches boiling point when both guys confront each other at a dinner party that Bridget has whipped up for her friends. Basically, she serves them blue soup. Suddenly, Daniel and Mark tie into each other with fists flying and wind up in the street for one of the funniest fights ever filmed. The highlight of the fisticuffs occurs when our combatants carry their slugfest into a restaurant and pause long enough to chime in for a chorus of 'Happy Birthday' for a dinner guest! Happily, unlike 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' nobody dies in 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' Nevertheless, scenarists Fielding, Curtis, and Davies maintain a commendable level of suspense throughout about Bridget's uncertain destiny.Freshman director Sharon Maguire manages to keep everything light and flighty with an occasional poignant moment. For example, Bridget attends a 'Tarts & Vicars' costume party dressed as a Playboy bunny, learning only too late that costumes were no longer required. Later, after she leaves Daniel and takes a job as an on-camera reporter for the TV show 'Sit Up, Britain,' she ends up exposing her buttocks to the camera when she slides down a firehouse pole! Basically, 'Bridget Jones's Diary' features several embarrassing moments, one wedding and a marriage renewal. When Bridget cruises for the elusive Mr. Right, her parents (Gemma Jones of 'Sense and Sensibility' and Jim Broadbent of 'The Avengers') break up and her mom takes up with a TV shopping channel host. Lonely, single, average females without the heroin-chic, media-made looks of haughty Cosmopolitan cover girls searching for love in all the wrong places (might as well include their similarly distressed masculine counterparts) will applaud this helium light whimsy.A truly outstanding cast breathes credibility into their characters. Zellweger steals every scene she has with her handsome English co-stars. Interestingly, Barbara Berkery, the dialogue coach who trained Gwyneth Paltrow for 'Sliding Doors' and 'Shakespeare in Love,' guided Zellweger's miraculous vocal transformation from Texan to Londoner. Further, Zellweger pulled a Robert De Niro stunt and packed on 20 actual pounds to appear plump enough for the role. Finally, to prepare herself intellectually, she spent time working at the London publishing house Picador, so she could get a feel for Bridget's job. Clearly, on the basis of this kind of dedication to her acting, Zellweger deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Hugh Grant breaks new ground playing a convincingly leery-eyed, conniving cad, while Colin Firth maintains his dignity no matter how silly he appears in a clownish brawl with Grant or whatever outfit he wears, such as a reindeer sweater when Bridget and he meet for the first time. Mind you, it is no mistake that Firth won the role of Mark Darcy. Fielding has written complimentary remarks about Firth in her two 'Bridget' novels and the in-joke is that Firth portrayed another Darcy in the acclaimed BBC version of 'Pride and Prejudice.' 'Bridget Jones's Diary' proves a thousand times better than Renee Zellweger's earlier and abysmal 'Nurse Betty.'",10,0,0,2 July 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," Red, White, and Blue!!!
","'Rocketeer' director Joe Johnston's 'Captain America' amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike 'Thor' and 'Green Lantern,' 'Captain America' ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but larger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If you recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two 'Fantastic Four' flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed, 'Captain America' boasts some amazing special effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans imparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of 'Captain America,' Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell co-star respectively as Captain America's superior and his love interest.'Captain America' opens in the present before it reverts to the past. Typically, movies with contemporary openings and endings sacrifice any sense of suspense. After all, you know if the characters thrive in the present that they must not have suffered in the past. Basically, this constitutes nothing more than a narrative cinematic convention. The chief difference here is that we're only given a glimpse of Captain America's legendary star-spangled shield instead of the eponymous protagonist himself. Anyway, the film unfolds in the frozen wasteland of the Arctic Circle as a Russian oil expedition stumbles onto something buried in the ice. They contact the Americans who slice into the ice with a laser, find a commodious craft of unknown origin, and uncover a circular red, white, and blue shield with a star. The scene shifts to March 1942 as despicable Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving of 'The Matrix') and his men storm into Tønsberg, Norway, and confiscate an enigmatic tesseract. Essentially, this is a magical cube boasting incalculable power. Supposedly, the tesseract was a fabulous jeweled artifact that belonged to the legendary Norse god Odin. Once anybody lays their eyes on it, they are no longer the same. Meanwhile, in New York City, the U.S. military brands Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) unfit for duty owing to a myriad of health problems. The resilient Rogers tries to enlist again when his buddy James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan of 'Black Swan') takes him to a showcase of futuristic technologies. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci of 'Easy A') eavesdrops on Rogers' conversation with Barnes about his desperate need to get into combat. Suitably impressed by Rogers' attitude, Erskine allows him to enlist. Moreover, Erskine recruits Rogers as part of a 'super-soldier' experiment under the aegis of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones of 'Coal Miner's Daughter') and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell of 'The Duchess'). Phillips displays considerable skepticism about Erskine's contention that Rogers qualifies as the ideal candidate for the procedure. One day during a training exercise, Phillips lobs a grenade among the recruits. Everybody but Rogers scrambles for cover, while he smothers the grenade with his frail body. Predictably, the grenade is a dummy, but Rogers' act of self-sacrificing bravery convinces the colonel that he is the appropriate choice. No sooner has Rogers emerged from the procedure as an entirely new man with a buffed up body than a Nazi saboteur steps in and kills Erskine. As it turns out, Erskine keep no notes except those in his head. After Erskine dies, Rogers experiences his new-found strength and captures the saboteur. The saboteur lives long enough to warn Rogers that he has to face more of his kind before he crunches on a cyanide capsule and croaks. Roger wins fame and acclaim across the country, but he suffers a setback because he is the first and only of his kind. Colonel Phillips reassigns him and Roger ends up at War Bond rallies where he acts like a cheerleader surrounded by dancing girls. Eventually, when our hero learns that his best friend has been caught, he disobeys orders and leads an inspirational rescue behind enemy lines. Now that Rogers has proved himself, he must face the Red Skull. The Red Skull is Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and he is so ambitious that he not only wants to crush America but also Adolf Hitler. Talk about a villain to end all villains! Anybody who has read the reprints of the World War 2 era 'Captain America' comic book should be thrilled with the way that 'The Chronicles of Narnia' scenarists Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have handled the original material by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Of course, Johnston and his scribes have ratcheted up the hardware for the big transformation scene that turns Steve Rodgers into Captain America. Altogether, 'Captain America' is a predictable but entertaining comic book movie with sensational special effects and a sympathetic hero. If you are a Marvel Comic fan, you should stick around after the lengthy end credits for a glimpse of the forthcoming 'Avengers' film due for release in May 2012.",10,38,62,1 August 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," A Sober-minded, Super-charged, but Serious Spy Saga
","If 'The Bourne Supremacy' gripped you with its spiraling melodramatic mixture of suspense and tension, then its white-knuckled sequel 'The Bourne Ultimatum' will have you hanging by your fingertips during most of its harrowing 115 minutes. Reportedly, this installment represents the final cinematic outing for novelist Robert Ludlum's death- proof, ex-CIA assassin Jason Bourne in his one-man war against the Central Intelligence Agency and his never-ending quest to regain his true identity. In many ways, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' recalls a number of post-Watergate spy thrillers that appeared in the 1970s, such as 'Three Days of the Condor' with Robert Redford, 'Scorpio' with Burt Lancaster, and 'The Killer Elite' with James Caan.Three things you should know about 'The Bourne Ultimatum' before you see it. First, if you have to excuse yourself from the movie, you'll miss loads of important information in an elaborately orchestrated plot that gathers momentum with each scene up to its hair-raising car chase finale. The noisy car crash is probably the most outlandish thing in this nimble, no-nonsense espionage epic that deplores the above and beyond the Constitution freedoms that the CIA seeks to curtail. Second, director Paul Greengrass doesn't let things lag for long in this hyper-kinetic, adrenalin-laced thriller that globe-trots around Europe and the U.S. This movie piles on tons of information and doesn't give you any time to sort it out. Usually, the hero stays a step ahead of you. Third, if you skipped either 'The Bourne Identity' and/or 'The Bourne Supremacy,' the spy-vs.-spy skulduggery taking place inside the CIA will knit your eyebrows into knots because you haven't been adequately briefed. For example, the tape-recorded confession in the first 20 minutes of 'The Bourne Ultimatum' happened near the end of the second 'Bourne' movie. The character, slippery, shifty-eyed CIA superior Ward Abbott (Brian Cox of 'The Glimmer Man'), had committed suicide. On the other hand, the neat thing about watching 'The Bourne Supremacy' again (if you have the time) is that 'The Bourne Ultimatum' literally resumes the action in mid-stride with an injured Matt Damon limping away from a dead hit-man. At the end of 'The Bourne Supremacy,' Bourne took time out to visit the daughter of a Russian couple that the CIA had ordered him to kill when he was an assassin. Apologizing for their deaths, he explained that the wife—her mother-- walked in unexpectedly on them and Bourne had to ice her, too. In 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' our amnesiac hero visits the brother of his girlfriend from the first 'Bourne,' Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente of 'Anatomy'), and he apologizes to him about his role in her death. No sooner has Bourne said and done this than he finds out that an English journalist, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine of 'Hot Fuzz'), who may have information about his origins. At this point, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' turns into the Will Smith thriller 'Enemy of the State' with its dazzling array of intelligence gathering devices. CIA surveillance technology hones in on the same London newspaperman when the unsuspecting reporter utters the word 'Blackbriar' during a cell phone conversation. Blackbriar serves as the code name for the organization that has replaced the murderous 'Treadstone' outfit from the 'Bourne Identity' that trained Bourne as an elite assassin. The chief villain in 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' black- ops CIA chief Noah Vosen (David W. Straitharn of 'Dolores Claiborne'), vows to track down Ross and he is prepared to liquidate him without a qualm if it is the only way to maintain secrecy. When he learns that Bourne has contacted Ross, Vosen labels Bourne a threat to the CIA and gives his government gunsels orders to shoot the ex-assassin on sight. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles of 'Mono Lisa Smile'), a CIA analyst from the first 'Bourne,' literally stumbles in on Bourne after he has searched the office of her London-based CIA superior, Neal Daniels (Colin Stinson of 'The Jacket') who funneled secret information to Ross about Bourne. Briefly, Nicky joins Bourne on the run, but she doesn't behave like the usual, blithering female Girl Friday who can only scream, sprain her ankle, or shed her wardrobe for sex. Neither director Greengrass nor his three scenarists keep Nicky on hand for long before they banish her from the action. Another 'Bourne Supremacy' alum, top CIA supervisor Pam Landy (Joan Allan of 'Face/Off') returns, but Vosen confines her to the sidelines as an adviser about Bourne's method of operation. Predictably, Pam doesn't act like a team player. She wants to invite Bourne back into the CIA with open arms, while Vosen prefers to shoot first and hold an séance afterward for any questions. Watching 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is like watching a PG-13 car accident. Paul Greengrass, who helmed 'The Bourne Supremacy,' keeps the action as genuine as possible as he did in the previous 'Bourne,' and he provides us with a front-row seat for all of the mayhem. Jason Bourne is a MacGyver style hero who has to rely on his wits to get him out of his predicaments. He is not allowed to conjure up a handy gadget at the right moment like James Bond might. The thuggish hand-to-hand combat scenes in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' are collisions of flesh & bone, and Greengrass stages them with hand-held cameras so that you will feel the intensity of each body blow, even though you'll never see any contact. In another scene, our hero plunges through several large windowpanes and the sounds of broken glass will make you grimace more than anything that you see. People are shooting people everywhere in 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' but Greengrass presents the violence in a narrative fashion. The shoot-outs, the fisticuffs, and the automobile chase propel the plot forward without halting it in a pageantry of digital special effects. Altogether, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is sober-minded, often realistic, but humorless adventure thriller that keeps our resilient hero dodging bullets while negotiating a challenging obstacle course of hazards.",10,0,1,8 August 2007
Fargo," A Cold-Blooded Comedy of Errors
","'Raising Arizona' filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have surpassed themselves again with their idiosyncratic dramedy thriller 'Fargo' about a gallery of memorable characters. A pregnant female police chief investigates a strange kidnapping case and tracks down a pair of ruthless killers and the Minneapolis automobile salesman who hired them. He learns about these two reprobates from a mechanic at the car dealership where he works. Like all first-class Coen brothers' movies, this police procedural operates on two levels and boasts not only eccentric characters but also outlandish predicaments. The use of an unlikely lady police chief, Frances McDormand, who stands in for the standard-issue male protagonist, sets this superior, often satirical crime saga apart from most entries in the genre. Incidentally, McDormand took home an Oscar for Best Actress as Marge Gunderson. Furthermore, the Coens shared the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Although it won only two Oscars, 'Fargo' received nominations for Best Picture, Best Picture, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing.' 'Fargo' unfolds with an amusing preamble: 'THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.' Of course, most of what happens here is strictly illusory. Like most Hollywood movies, 'Fargo' is a synthesis of the real and the imaginary. In the article 'Rewind: What Part Of 'Based On' Don't You Understand?' author Karl Heitmueller wrote: 'Joel Cohen told 'Time Out' that 'if an audience believes that something's based on a real event, it gives you permission to do things they might otherwise not accept.'' Heitmueller classifies 'Fargo' and other movies, like 'Ray' and 'Gangs of New York' as BOATS movies. According to Heitmueller, 'A BOATS movie is not a documentary, and while watching one we should be smart enough to take everything we see in it with a big ol' grain of popcorn salt. The problem seems to be that audiences often overlook the words 'based on.' It's not Hollywood's fault that, amazingly, many people just don't question what's presented in a BOATS movie — that moviegoers don't stop to consider that it's impossible to know exactly what happened on the doomed fishing boat the Andrea Gale in 'The Perfect Storm.' The contrived plot involves a cash starved car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macey of 'The Cooler'), who hires a couple of lowlife criminals, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi of 'Con-Air') and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare of 'The Big Lebowski') to kidnap his ditzy wife, Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrüd of 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'), whose kidnapping scene is hilarious. Jean gets wrapped up in a shower curtain and scrambles about her house in desperation to escape them. Meantime, Jerry hopes that he can force his gruff father-in-law, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell of 'Saving Private Ryan'), who owns the car dealership where Jerry works, to pay the ransom. The father-in-law isn't happy about the arrangement. He would rather hand over the loot to the kidnappers than entrust Jerry with the cash. Indeed, scheming Jerry plans to split the loot between the three of them. Ultimately, Marge investigates, tracking down leads, and questions Jerry. Naturally, everything turns into a comedy of errors, and nothing works out for either the desperate car salesman or his paid abductors. Marge proves that he is no pushover when he wields her service revolver. She drops Garear in his tracks when he tries to run from her. Ace British lenser Roger Deakins' cinematography is a pleasure to behold, and he captures the grim setting of North Dakota with its snow-swept terrain. Some of the violence is brutal. When the two kidnappers are pulled over by a state trooper, Gaear shoots him in the head and blood bubbles out of his head like a fountain. The dry dialogue that everybody delivers is interesting, too. 'Fargo' has thus far spawned two made-for-television shows just as bogus as the movie 'Fargo.' Produced for $7 million, this Coen brothers release generated over $60 million at the box office, making it a fabulously successful movie.",10,0,0,4 March 2016
Rush," Good Race Car Epic
","In 'Rush,' Oscar-winning helmer Ron Howard returns to the subject matter that he cut his teeth on as a film director: fast cars. In 1977, Howard made his directorial debut with the hilarious manhunt comedy 'Grand Thief Auto' (1977) for executive producer Roger Corman about characters careening around in cars. Like 'Grand Theft Auto,' 'Rush' focuses on fast cars. Unlike 'Grand Theft Auto,' where amateurs did the driving, skilled professionals are behind the wheels in 'Rush.' Not only do they travel at higher speeds, but they also tread more treacherous roads. This polished but predictable saga has to do with the historic rivalry between Formula One British speedster James Hunt and Austrian automotive genius Niki Lauda. 'Rush' spends most of its leisurely 123 minutes on its protagonists and their clashes rather than the experience of hurling along European thoroughfares at homicidal speeds in the equivalent of bobsleds on wheels with rocket fuel. Aussie-born Chris Hemsworth of 'Thor' has been cast appropriately enough as Hunt, while Spanish actor Daniel Brühl impersonates Niki Lauda. Historically, Lauda and Hunt jostled each other for the top position during the 1976 Grand Prix racing season. Ron Howard keeps the soap opera scenes with the love interests of both racers to a minimum so as to maintain momentum over the long haul. Consequently, Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara look dazzling but have little to say. Ultimately, these two competitors would come to realize that their ruthless rivalry enhanced their racetrack performance. An enduring, universal, life-truth lurks beneath all the scenic cities, challenging racetracks, and the charismatic performers in 'Rush.' In the self-help handbook for mercenaries and rogues in general, 'The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries' observes: 'The world is richer when you turn enemies into friends, but that's not the same as you being richer.' 'Rush' unfolds in 1976 as our protagonists are poised to race at the Nurburgring track in Germany. No sooner has Howard and Morgan established this momentous setting than they flashback to show how Hunt and Lauda got their respective starts in Formula 3 racing. Hunt's father plead with his son to become a physician. Lauda's father had planned to take his son into the family business. Naturally, neither patriarch funds their sons' racetrack fantasies, and our heroes go out and make things happen for themselves. Hunt finds a wealthy sponsor enamored of racing to put him behind the wheel, while Lauda buys his way onto the Ferrari team. Hunt treats Lauda with utter contempt and refers to him as a rat. Lauda points out rats possess a highly developed instinct for survival. Howard cuts back and forth between these two and creates some palatable suspense as they chase each other throughout the Grand Prix. Mind you, the suspense doesn't so much lie in the actual driving sequences, where speeds of 170 mph is typical, but in their face-to-face confrontations. Lauda doesn't race to defy death as Hunt does. Hunt claims woman are attracted to him because he lays his life on the line in every race. On the other hand, Lauda races to survive rather than die. He has a twenty per cent rule that governs his decision when to race. Lauda refuses to participate if the chances are greater than twenty per cent that he may perish. Hunt challenges Lauda at one point when the Austrian tries to convince his competitors to cancel the rain-swept Nurburgring track. Hunt humiliates Lauda for urging them to cancel the race. Eventually, Lauda allows himself to be brow-beaten into the race with horrendous results. The courage Lauda musters to recover so swiftly from a nearly fatal accident is inspirational and a testament to his resilience. Lauda's car crashes during the race, and he is badly burnt. Painful skin grafts and having his lungs vacuumed out ensue, and Lauda watches in horror from his hospital bed as Hunt makes up for lost time. Hunt's quick string of victories brings him close to surpassing Lauda. The rivalry really kicks in at this point, and life becomes stranger than fiction.Hemsworth and Brühl resemble their real-life counterparts. If you delay your departure when the end credits roll, you'll see the actual Hunt and Lauda. Howard slips under their collective skins with 'Frost/Nixon' scenarist Peter Morgan to explore what drove them. Each racer emerges as complex and three-dimensional. Basically, they are iconoclasts who became heroic legends. Wisely, Howard and Morgan never make either one appear more sympathetic than the other. Most Hollywood movies divide and conquer when it comes to competitors. 'Warrior' (2011) pitted brother against brother, and one triumphed over the other simply because he generated greater sympathy. Hemsworth has the more ostentatious role. Essentially, Hunt was either behind the wheel or in a lady's boudoir. Comparably, Brühl creates a strong impression as Niki Lauda. The ascetic Austrian driver shunned all forms of hedonism. He constituted the polar opposite of the glib, fun-loving, skirt-chasing Hunt. Lauda was a perfectionist who constantly devised ways to lighten the weight and improve the performance of his cars. Unlike the milestone racing movies 'Grand Prix' and 'Le Mans,' 'Rush doesn't deal with a single race. Instead, Howard provides a tour of the European championship racing circuit. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography gives us some vivid glimpses of Formula One racing from behind the steering wheel. Although we come to understand how dangerous driving a Formula One car can be, we are rarely given stretches where the drivers scramble to get beyond each other. 'Rush' contains the equivalent of a 'greatest hits' montage of the various races. Spectators who don't follow Formula One specifically or car racing in general may not know that these drivers harness themselves into the equivalent of rocket-sleds with jet fuel and roar through the countryside. While speed denotes the winner, skill keeps the driver on the course. Strong characterization, some narrative surprises, and scenic locales distinguish this interesting but sedate racing epic.",8,2,3,6 October 2013
Predator," No Time to Bleed!
","The people who produced 'Predator' imaginatively superimposed a science fiction saga about an extra-terrestrial warrior onto a commando hostage rescue mission movie. Just when you think that you are locked in the middle of a gritty, realistic, hell-for-leather, military melodrama, the filmmakers whip out a science fiction alien to end all science fiction aliens. Future 'Die Hard' director John McTiernan helmed this nimble, profane, exciting, and often suspenseful actioneer penned by siblings Jim and John Thomas who later wrote the Kurt Russell, jet-hijacking thriller 'Executive Decision.' Unfortunately, they also provided the story for the ill-conceived Will Smith western 'Wild Wild West.' 'Predator' takes place deep in the jungles of Central America and pits an elite military team commanded by Arnold Schwarzenegger against a 'Predator' from another galaxy. Our heroes are recruited for a top-secret rescue mission by the C.I.A. to recover a diplomat whose plane crashed in hostile territory. As it turns out, the C.I.A. lied to Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) about the identity of the man they are supposed to rescue. Our heroes wind up blowing a guerrilla camp to smithereens, but they don't arrive in time to save any hostages. As they traipse off to a rendezvous with a helicopter, they encounter something like nobody has encountered. The eponymous monster's appearance remains singular in the annals of sci-fi. Essentially, the predator resembles gigantic Jamaican dude with dreadlocks and a turtle shell for a helmet. The alien's face is ghoulish. Four small horns surround its ugly mouth, and it has huge claws for hands. Indeed, it is the perfect embodiment of a 1950s' space creature. The alien enjoys one major advantage over its victims. The Predator can cloak itself so that it is well-nigh invisible to the naked eye. Further, the Predator sees everything from a heat sensor perspective. He fires beams of energy that create fatal wounds. He can deploy twin razor-sharp knives from his wrist. Most of all, the Predator searches for trophies. He collects skulls spinal columns, has no qualms about stripping the flesh off his human victims, and then hanging them upside down from tree branches. What sets 'Predator' apart from the usual creature feature is that the Predator is a hunter, and it refuses to slay and fillet innocents who display no pugnacity. Dutch's commando team takes a woman hostage, but the predator never attacks her. Inevitably, Dutch must go toe-to-toe with this extremely aggressive adversary after it has exterminated his entire team. The Predator literally gets in Arnold's face. Our hero finds himself truly between a rock and a hard place with his alien foe. Dutch is reduced to relying on his wits and fists so he can triumph over the alien. Some might say that 'Predator' is 'Escape from N.Y.' cris-crossed with the original 'Star Trek' TV show episode 'Arena' where Captain Kirk fought with the murderous Gorn captain. Jesse Ventura co-stars as one of the commando team. He totes around an impressive, fully automatic, Vulcan mini-gun that can spew 200 rounds in the blink of an eye. Of course, there is no way this weapon could function as a portable, hand-held firearm under the conditions depicted in 'Predator,' but Ventura is such a massive fellow he makes it appear credible that he could handle this weapon. Incidentally, the Hawkins character who spouts the bad jokes to Billy (Sonny Landham of '48 Hrs') is none other than Shane Black. Black achieved greater fame as a scenarist with 'Lethal Weapon,' 'The Last Boy Scout,' 'Last Action Hero' and 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.' 'Predator' boasts colorful characters, narrative surprises, quotable dialogue, and good computer-generated effects. Bill Duke's character has a habit of shaving his largely clean shaven face with a disposable razor. The elaborate booby-traps that our heroes set to capture the Predator look like Rube Goldberg contraptions. This 107-minute sci-fi actioneer never wears out its welcome. Interestingly, although Dutch wounds the Predator in the final scene, the alien self-destructs rather than lets itself be captured.",10,1,1,13 July 2010
Nightcrawler," Might Have Been More Lurid
","'Bourne Legacy' screenwriter Dan Gilroy exposes the skullduggery behind tabloid TV journalism in 'Nightcrawler,' a gritty, engrossing, but seldom surprising satire with savvy actor Jake Gyllenhaal cast as an unsavory stringer with a camcorder. Hollywood has been producing exposés about the depths that shady journalists will plumb to land the big scoop. Some of the best include 'Five Star Final' (1931), the venerable 'Citizen Kane' (1941), and 'Ace in the Hole' (1951). If you know anything about the history of yellow journalism, few things can top what one sleazy news reporter orchestrated during the execution of Ruth Snyder at Sing Sing Prison back in 1928. Convicted of murdering her husband, Snyder was sentenced to die in the electric chair. The New York Daily News hired amateur photographer Tom Howard to cover the execution, and Howard snapped a photo of Snyder quivering in the electric chair as 700 volts sizzled through her body. Naturally, the infamous photo appeared a little fuzzy, but the Daily News ran the notorious picture on its front page. Sales of the newspaper skyrocketed, and the Daily News ran the same electrifying photo again on its front page the following day. Most of what occurs in 'Nightcrawler' is tame compared with the stunt that the Daily News reporter pulled. Indeed, little of it is as exciting as the real-life incidents that the movie's technical advisors have encountered on a regular basis. Nevertheless, this polished, fast-paced, pulp thriller about what an ambitious but unscrupulous journalist does to deliver the goods is often more amusing than audacious. A gaunt-looking Gyllenhaal manages to be both charismatic and creepy as the anti-heroic protagonist, and he lets nothing interfere with his ignoble aspirations. Rene Russo makes the most of her role as an over-the-hill Los Angeles television news director, while Bill Paxton scores in a peripheral role as a veteran nightcrawler who shows Gyllenhaal the ropes. Although he doesn't break new ground with 'Nightcrawler,' Gilroy proves with his directorial debut that he can capably stage not only suspenseful shootouts and careening car chases, but also conjure up flawed but hypnotic characters in a morally skewered universe.Initially, when we encounter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal of 'End of Watch'), he is a petty thief who will pinch anything. He steals copper, cyclone fencing, wristwatches, and even tournament racing bikes. Eventually, he discovers that money can made as a freelance crime videographer lensing scenes of blood-splattered murder and mayhem. Since he resides in Los Angeles, where people die violently every day, Bloom decides to hock a trophy bike for a camcorder and a scanner. No sooner does he try his hand at his new profession than he rubs shoulders with a professional stringer. Joe Loder (the incomparable Bill Paxton of 'Aliens') cruises around in a souped-up minivan equipped with high-tech cameras and a sidekick to shoot those big scenes. Loder has a computer editing console on-board, and he can upload video to the highest bidder at the various competing TV stations around Los Angeles. Loder admires Bloom's determination and drive. Bloom scoots around in crappy 1985 Tercel and wields a low-tech camcorder. He sneaks inside a house where a homicide has taken place and reorganizes the crime scene so it appears more photogenic and then sells it to a TV station. Later, the enterprising Bloom hires a homeless man, Rick (Riz Ahmed of 'Centurion'), to serve as his navigator. Whenever Bloom races off to a potential crime scene, Rick struggles to route his impatient employer along the fastest streets to the crime scene. Bloom pays him $30 a day, but Rick is still pretty clueless about being a stringer. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous but captivating Bloom has taken a shine to a dame, Nina Romina (Rene Russo of 'Lethal Weapon 3'), who works at the lowest rated Los Angeles TV station. 'I want something people can't turn away from,' she tells Bloom. 'If it bleeds, it leads,' she explains. She avoids his amorous advances, but she praises his video. At one point, to acquire better video of a corpse after a car crash, Bloom drags the body into the light. At the station, Nina observes that Bloom has blood on his hands. Indeed, Gilroy uses Romina to make a sarcastic comment about Bloom's cynical nature, but Bloom has no qualms. Ultimately, Bloom and Rick get so good at their game they beat the LAPD to a crime scene, and Bloom prowls the premises where three corpses lay sprawled in puddles of blood and photographs them. He even shoots footage of the perpetrators fleeing. Bloom orchestrates events so he can make big bucks off the crime as well as the eventual capture of the killers.If you have read the Internet interview with Austin Raishbrook who served as the technical adviser for 'Nightcrawler,' you have to wonder why Gilroy didn't replicate more of Raishbrook's exploits. Some of the sights Raishbrook and his two brothers have seen would make you cringe. When the Raishbrook brothers rush out to shoot video, they suit up in bulletproof vests and prepare for the worst. Not only have they have been shot at, but also thugs have smashed their equipment. Some of the chaos they have seen sounds surreal compared to the formulaic genre shenanigans Gilroy puts his characters through in this vivid R-rated urban epic. Despite its shortage of surprises, 'Nightcrawler' features some incredibly amoral characters and top-notch performances. Bloom doesn't care what it takes to obtain footage, even if it means either sacrificing an employee or eliminating the competition. In this respect, 'Nightcrawler' differs from most movies where the villains get their just comeuppance. Louis Bloom is most certainly not a hero. He qualifies as a vile, low-life, bottom-feeder, but 'Nightcrawler' doesn't punish him for his wicked ways. Instead, he comes up smelling like roses no matter what he does and that is the singular thing that distinguishes the above-average 'Nightcrawler' from most mainstream, standard-issue, Hollywood film releases.",8,0,3,10 November 2014
Oblivion," 'Oblivion' Lives Up To Its Title
","Anybody familiar with science fiction cinema will know where Tom Cruise's third sci-fi saga 'Oblivion' is heading before it arrives as its formulaic destination. Whether anybody cares is another question. Frankly, I preferred Cruise in his previous movie 'Jack Reacher' to the slick but lackluster 'Oblivion.' Tom Cruise displayed greater personal charisma in 'Jack Reacher' than he does in 'Oblivion.' Mind you, nothing about this post-apocalyptic actioneer where earthlings duke it out with better-armed extraterrestrials is anything like Cruise's first sci-fi outing, Steven Spielberg's 'Minority Report.' 'Minority Report' was a futuristic morality thriller set in Washington, D.C., about an elaborate machine that predicted crimes before they occurred. Instead, 'Oblivion' resembles Steven Spielberg's abysmal adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic 'War of the Worlds' with its global destruction drama where Cruise struggles to protect his daughter.Comparatively, 'Oblivion' occurs primarily on Earth, but the action unfolds in the year 2077 long after planet Earth has been devastated by both aliens and Mother Nature. Cruise is suitably cast as a handy man in a uniform who flies around in a dragon-fly helicopter and repairs drones on the planet surface. Although he has five decades of stardom under his belt, Cruise hasn't let it go to his waistline. In other words, he isn't ashamed to show off his lean, muscular physique. Unfortunately, he plays a rather dreary, straightforward schmuck who, through no fault of his own, could be anything but dreary. When he isn't fixing space gadgets, Cruise falls back into action hero mode with a look of grim determination to vanquish evil. Meanwhile, two women wage their own war over him. Sure, even in the future, some things never really change. This enigmatic, earth-bound, sci-fi epic looks sensational. Oscar winning 'Life of Pi' lenser Claudio Miranda's lush cinematography and Darren Gilford's sleek production designs are a treat for the eye. Sadly, stunning, sunlit scenery and scintillating photography cannot compensate for a plodding narrative. Sophomore director Joseph Kosinski of 'Tron: Legacy' and 'Trepass' scenarist Karl Gajdusek with 'Toy Story 3' scribe Michael Arndt serve up predictable pabulum, with humdrum characters, and surprises that only sci-fi fans will anticipate without relish. I cannot really divulge much about the plot without spoiling it.The premise of 'Oblivion' is difficult to accept without hoisting your eyebrows. Most of planet Earth sprawls in ruins after the mother of all wars. Aliens identified only as 'Scavengers' have blasted away half of the Moon. Afterward, Mother Nature raised Hell itself with every cataclysm you can imagine. What Mother Nature and the aliens didn't bring to this apocalyptic smackdown, Earth provided in the form of nuclear weapons. We're informed that Earth repulsed the extraterrestrials, but the devastation has prompted mankind to pack up for Saturn's largest moon Titan. Meantime, Earth's survivors have masterminded an enormous tetrahedral space station known simply as the Tet. Imagine the Death Star from the 'Star Wars' franchise orbiting Earth. This Tet can launch dozens of spherical drones that resemble the ball turret gunners on vintage B-17 Flying Fortresses from World War II. Jack keeps these heavily-armed, drones airborne and the drones fly sorties to safeguard mega-gigantic hydro rigs sucking water out of Earth's ocean. These rigs are extracting the last useful minerals that will be shipped off to Titan. However, there is one catch. The Scavengers haven't entirely surrendered, and these guerrilla factions menace Jack and company. Nevertheless, Jack and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) live together in blissful ignorance on a towering house far above Earth's surface and conduct their assigned routines.One day Jack watches as a spacecraft re-enters Earth's atmosphere and crashes nearby. He manages to get to the crash site and save one of the life pods that contains Julia (Olga Kurylenko of 'Centurion') before the drones wipe the rest out. All along, our hero has been having some wild dreams inhabited by a woman who resembles Julia. Equally distressing for Jack is that the lady of his dreams lived over sixty years ago well before he was born. Imagine his surprise when she tells him that she is his wife. Things get even weirder when Jack stumbles onto an army of beastly looking customers led by a cigar-chomping Morgan Freeman. This is about as far as I can go without blowing the lids on several significant plot points.'Oblivion' doesn't qualify as the kind of sci-fi movie you'll remember a week after you've seen it. The aliens versus earthlings tale doesn't provide the kind of cool looking action featured in either 'Star Wars' or 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars.' Cruise's military outfit and his arsenal of weapons look bland. The clever looking dragon-fly helicopter performs some nimble stunts, but it is a far cry from the chopper in 'Blue Thunder.' The plot and its surprises are something that you'd expect from the SyFy Channel. Only a handful of characters populate this two-hour plus spectacle, and none of them spout any memorable dialogue or strike an interesting pose. At one point, Cruise's Jack straddles a motorcycle and rides through desolate oceans that have become colossal sandlots with nuclear subs and aircraft carriers littering the terrain. The mission that Jack embarks on eventually is straight out of the first 'Star Wars' movie as is an aerial dogfight between Jack and the drones along a twisting corridor of rocks. When you finally learn what is really going on in 'Oblivion,' you'll know why it lives up to its name. Director Joseph Kosinski really botched this adventure. Not only does he wimp out with his characters, but also he stages some of the tamest confrontations in many moons. Incidentally, after you watch or avoid 'Oblivion,' you should watch another sci-fi movie with similar themes entitled 'Moon' with Sam Rockwell. Altogether, 'Oblivion' qualifies as respectable but second-rate fare.",5,2,6,26 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Ham-Fisted Performances, Poor Plotting, Labored Jokes, and Sudden Lapses of Violence
","'No Country for Old Men' directors Joel and Ethan Coen's uneven, overwrought, misanthropic comedy of errors 'Burn After Reading' should have been burned after they made it. Remember, the Coen Brothers won the 2008 Best Picture Oscar for their inspired but violent account of an indestructible hit-man who methodically tracked down his victims and killed them without a qualm. As their first feature since 'No Country for Old Men, 'Burn After Reading' radiates barely a modicum of the customary Coen luminosity. The fourteenth movie that the two brothers have helmed together struggles to be as side-splitting as either 'The Big Lebowski' or 'Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou.' Instead, this forgettable farce turns out to be as mirthless as two previous Coen misfires 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and 'Intolerable Cruelty.' 'Burn After Reading' opens like a Tom Clancy techno-thriller. An orbiting spy satellite camera zooms into the Chesapeake Bay area on the East Coast, penetrates the cloud cover and pinpoints C.I.A. Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. A bow-tied, bald-headed, Princeton-educated, career C.I.A. analyst, Osborne 'Ozzie' Cox (John Malkovich of 'Being John Malkovich'), explodes with rage when his boss (David Rasche of 'An Innocent Man') relieves him of his duties on the Balkans desk and shuffles him off to a lower security grade State Department post. The volatile Cox spews profanity when his colleagues attribute his inferior job performance to alcoholism. Cox quits the C.I.A. rather than being reassigned. As he storms out of the room, he vows to pen a tell-all memoir. Later, every time we see Ozzie working on his memoirs, he clutches a drink in his fist.The scene shifts to Hardbodies Fitness Center. Personal trainer Linda Litzke (Oscar-winning Frances McDormand of 'Fargo') plans to have a number of surgical cosmetic procedures performed on her flabby physique. 'I have gone as far as I can with this body,' she whines to her plastic surgeon. She is looking for somebody to date on the Internet and she hates her appearance. When her company insurance refuses to cover these elective operations, Linda blows a gasket. Although she isn't pleased with herself, her Hardbodies boss Ted (Richard Jenkins of 'Step Brothers') drools whenever he is around her. Linda calls him her friend and then all but ignores him. Another Hardbodies trainer, bimbo-brained Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt of 'Ocean's Twelve') who wears his iPod like jewelry, discovers an anonymous computer disc left in the ladies locker room that contains Ozzie's C.I.A. secrets. Against Ted's wishes, Linda and Chad blackmail Ozzie for $50-thousand dollars so Linda can pay for her four procedures. Meanwhile, Ozzie's ice princess of a wife Katie (Oscar winning Tilda Swinton of 'Michael Clayton') indulges in an extramarital fling with a married but philandering U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer (a bearded George Clooney of 'Leatherheads') who constructs mechanical sex machines in his spare time. Pfarrer is married to a successful children's author, Sally (Elizabeth Marvel), who hates the dinner parties that Harry takes her to at Katie's house. Not surprisingly, Ozzie refuses to pay Linda and Chad a dime so Linda approaches officials in the Russian Embassy. Meanwhile, Katie locks Ozzie out of their house and begins divorce proceedings.Ensemble piece that it is, 'Burn After Reading' meanders from one quirky character's complications to another in a haphazard manner. The Coen's erratic script for this farcical but violent yarn about a group of largely unsavory dimwits that make moronic fools of themselves seethes with irony. Surprisingly, the Coens seem to have taken leave of their comic senses because their sophisticated humor falls flat on its face. Moreover, in their efforts to drum up laughs, co-stars Brad Pitt and George Clooney deliver performances that verge on epilepsy. Tilda Swinton is particularly rude and hostile as a pediatrician with the bedside manner of a crocodile. She has no problem bossing around either Ozzie or Harry, but she cannot get a child to take its medicine. Pathetic, selfish, delusional cretins populate 'Burn After Reading' and they refuse to accept reality. For example, Linda believes that if you think positive thoughts that positive things will happen. Indeed, this eclectic gallery of characters qualifies more as caricatures. Since we feel little sympathy toward them, the trials and tribulations that they endure to attain their goals rarely prompts anything more than a smirk or two.Ultimately, 'Burn After Reading' devotes more time to infidelity rather than of espionage. This hyperactive but less-than-hilarious hokum qualifies as a failure on multiple levels. Ham-fisted performances, poor plotting, labored jokes, and sudden lapses of violence spoil what might have been a neat little bit of nothing.",1,104,201,26 September 2008
Watchmen," The Flip Side of 'The Incredibles'
","Anybody who has read Alan Moore's ground-breaking graphic novel 'Watchmen' should enjoy the R-rated, 161-minute, Warner Brothers/Paramount Studios' big-screen adaptation. 'Dawn of the Dead' director Zack Snyder's 'Watchmen' ranks as the best costumed crime fighters movie of all time. Think of it as the 'Gone with the Wind' of superhero sagas. 'Watchmen' makes both 'The Dark Knight' and 'Batman Begins' look like adolescent fantasies. The crime busters of 'Watchmen' aren't role models, and the novel and the film both emerge as hopelessly cynical with cosmic irony galore. Scenarists David ('X-Men') Hayter and newcomer Alex Tse have retained about 90 percent of Moore's novel.This exciting epic about a faction of superheroes based in New York City who come out of retirement (call it the dark flipside of 'The Incredibles') to save the world from itself qualifies as an elaborate exercise in cutting-edge computer-generated visuals and high-octane, adrenaline-laced heroics. Parents who take their children to see 'Watchmen' ought to be reported to the Department of Human Services. Although the violence isn't gratuitous, 'Watchmen' features scenes of acute brutality and carnage. An unsavory superhero guns down a pregnant Vietnamese woman with extreme prejudice after she slashes his face with a broken beer bottle. In another scene, a prison inmate brandishes a portable, electric circular saw and mistakenly cuts off another inmate's forearms. Violence is one aspect of 'Watchmen,' while nudity is quite another. 'Watchmen' is undoubtedly the first mainstream Hollywood movie that presents full frontal male nudity, too. The only genuine superhero, Dr. Manhattan, parades around more often than not in his birthday suit, looking like Obsession cologne product placement.The far-fetched action unfolds one dark, gloomy night with one of these crime fighters, Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of 'Grey's Anatomy'), swaps blows with an assailant who has invaded his high-rise apartment. In an amusing reference to his last movie, director Zach Snyder has designated 300 as the number of Comedian's apartment. The assailant beats Comedian to a pulp and then propels him through a plate-glass window without a qualm. Comedian plunges many stories to the street below and splatters in a bloody pile of limbs and legs. Naturally, the N.Y.P.D. doesn't have a clue. One of Comedian's fellow crime fighters, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Halley of the 1976 'Bad News Bears'), launches his own investigation. Rorschach warns the rest of his cohorts, Night Owl 2 (Patrick Wilson of 'Lakeview Terrace'), Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup of 'Almost Famous'), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode of 'Match Point'), and Silk Spectre 2 (Valerie Perrine lookalike Malin Akerman of '27 Dresses') that somebody is out to slaughter them. For the record, Night Owl 2 is the equivalent of Batman, without a Robin, who flies around in a stealth fighter that resembles an electric shaver. Silk Spectre 2 is a butt kicking Wonder Woman clone. She doesn't need a man to hold her hand, especially when she helps liberate one of her own during a prison break with convicts lining up to smudge her make-up with fists and feet. Rorschach is a pint-sized Humphrey Bogart type who wears a stocking over his face with an ink blot pattern that shifts. He is an uncompromising crime buster who sees life in terms of good and evil with no shades of gray. Ozymandias is the smartest man in the world with a flair for public relations. He has the ability to move around as rapidly as Ricochet Rabbit. Dr. Manhattan is a tall, blue, bald, blank-eyed muscular male who wears eye-liner and mascara, hates wearing clothing and can atomize anything with a thought. Again, Dr. Manhattan is the only superhero in the Watchmen group.DC Comics published Moore's graphic, twelve-chapter novel in 1986 and 1987. Like the novel, the theatrical 'Watchmen' takes place back in 1985. Essentially, 'Watchmen' is a science-fiction saga about an alternate version of America. Snyder's movie condenses over twenty years of costumed crime fighter history during the opening credits. Indeed, 'Watchmen' combines elements of 'Forrest Gump' and every Oliver Stone movie since 'Platoon.' President John Kennedy shakes hands with Dr. Manhattan, while President Richard Nixon exploits Dr. Manhattan as a nuclear deterrent. The story includes JFK's assassination in Dallas, Texas, with a clear view of his assassin. In the time altered universe of 'Watchmen,' America wins the Vietnam War largely through Dr. Manhattan's intervention.In the beginning, Dr. Manhattan was ordinary Jewish physicist Jonathan Osterman. He died tragically during an accident at a top-secret, government research lab that disintegrated his body. He manages to reconstitute himself and emerges as America's chief weapon against the Soviet Union. Nixon dispatches Dr. Manhattan to Vietnam with Comedian, and Dr. Manhattan wins the war. Despite victory in Vietnam, America still wallows in domestic turmoil that degenerates into chaos and street violence. Hippies plant flowers in the rifle barrels of military policemen who massacre them. The police go on strike and eventually Nixon passes legislation that outlaws vigilante-minded costume clad crime fighters that aren't employed by the government.Basically, the 'Watchmen' plot defies synopsis. Like Moore's novel, the story boasts enough material for an entire film franchise, but 'Watchmen' does an excellent job of bringing all the action together in less than three hours to create a coherent but outlandish parable of an alternate future. The idea that victory in Vietnam would not have made a difference in the American Dream is fairly audacious for any movie. Moreover, Snyder and his scenarists take the concept of vigilante heroes farther than even 'The Dark Knight' dared and meditates on the ultimate contradictions involved with these costume clad crime fighters. The 9/11 finale with its surprise ending is a mind-blower that will leave you reeling. Like 'Forrest Gump,' 'Watchmen' inserts several landmark rock songs to underline its multiple messages. 'Watchmen' lacks a happy ending and the problems that humanity faces here aren't simple.",10,1,9,8 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Natural 'Bourne' Killers!
","The Matt Damon international spy thriller 'The Bourne Identity' qualifies as an entertaining, European-lensed, cloak & dagger epic that relies on hair-raising heroics rather than in-depth characterization. Based ostensibly on the 1980 bestseller by bestselling author Robert Ludlum, this spirited but spartan saga about an amnesia-ailing C.I.A. assassin left for dead in the stormy Mediterranean Sea on a dark night after he takes two bullets in the back amounts to a surprise and a guilty pleasure from journeyman director Doug Liman of 'Swingers' and 'Go.' Little did Liman know when he made 'The Bourne Identity' that he would exert an impact on the most famous espionage franchise in the world, the James Bond series, and that Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli would alter 007 so that he resembled Jason Bourne more than Ian Fleming's protagonist. The deja-vu, derring-do screenplay by veteran Hollywood hack Tony Gilroy of 'Duplicity' and 'Proof of Life' and newcomer William Blake Herron delivers everything that fans of spy thriller treasure most: a laconic but likable hero, a nasty nemesis, a harrowing car chase, snappy bone-crackling martial arts fights, and gritty gunfights galore. Indeed, despite its far-fetched plot, most of 'The Bourne Identity' looks as realistic as most Hollywood movies allow themselves to be.The film unfolds as the crew of a small Italian fishing vessel bound for Marseille pulls an unconscious man in a scuba suit out of the sea. Not only does the ship's captain does two slugs out of our anonymous protagonist, but he also removes a capsule from his hip which contains an encoded Swiss bank account. Eventually, this rugged survivor (Matt Damon of 'Dogma') recuperates, and he remembers neither his identity nor his past. Off he heads to Zurich where he finds a safe deposit box stuffed with dozens of passports, wads of cash, and an automatic pistol. No sooner has he set foot outside the bank than an informant alerts the C.I.A. in Langley, Virginia,. Bourne's ruthless, amoral C.I.A. superior Ted Cronklin (Chris Cooper of 'Money Train') has dispatched him to assassinate a South African politician, but Bourne vanished without a trace. Now, Cronklin sends out more heavily-armed assassin and snarls: 'I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown!' Back in Zurich, Bourne eludes the authorities, bribes a young Swiss woman, innocent bystander Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente of 'Run, Lola, Run'), to drive him to Paris, France. As Marie and he are getting acquainted, a hit man interrupts their romance and riddles everything in sight. Suddenly, Bourne finds himself fighting for his life with martial arts skills that he never knew he possessed. An inventive, off-beat, evasive auto chase that careens through packed Parisian streets, sidewalks, and stairways ranks as the liveliest since John Glen's 'For Your Eyes Only,' with our leads crammed into a vehicle the size of an apple cart with hordes of cops on their heels.Director Doug Liman paces the action for maximum suspense and keeps our resilient hero on his toes throughout this whirlwind thriller. Although 'The Bourne Identity' winds up just as predictable and preposterous as any scenic James Bond spectacle, this lean, mean, PG-13-rated opus is nevertheless a resourceful and ingenious potboiler worth watching at least twice. Moreover, Matt Damon proves that eh can make the grade as a tough-as-nails action-hero, more so than his ill-fated Oscar winning 'Good Will Hunting' co-scenarist Ben Affleck who whined his way through the woebegone 'Sum of All Fears.' The scene where the assassin shatters the window to enter the premises and surprise Bourne is a jolt to the system. Liman co-produced the two sequels that followed. A top-flight supporting cast is fleshed out my Brian Cox and Clive Owen.",8,2,2,21 March 2009
Baby Driver," Baby, Does This Movie Rock'N Roll!!!
","The trailer that first advertised British writer & director Edgar Wright's 'Baby Driver' made it look like a Young Adult knock-off of French producer Luc Beeson's 'Transporter' franchise with rugged, austere Jason Statham. Fortunately, nothing could be farther from the truth. Indeed, the films both deal with elusive getaway car drivers. Despite their apparent resemblance, these movies share little in common except for their automotive audacity. Comparatively, 'Baby Driver' is nothing like Wright's earlier comic trilogy 'Shaun of the Dead' (2994), 'Hot Fuzz' (2007), and 'The World's End' (2013). Two of those movies dealt with supernatural creatures, while 'Hot Fuzz' constituted a police parody. Furthermore, 'Baby Driver' is nothing like Wright's other unconventional outing 'Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World' (2010). Indeed, Wright performs a 180 with 'Baby Driver,' a straightforward, white-knuckled, R-rated, crime thriller about blood, death, and consequences. Meantime, unlike the usual bombastic summer release, 'Baby Driver' isn't an outlandish escapade. Instead, it is a superbly staged, adrenalin-laced actioneer which rarely pulls its punches. The first three-fourths of this Atlanta-lensed saga is top-notch, while the final fourth marks time with the hero's atonement for his crimes. Another thing that differentiates 'Baby Driver' from most summer movies is it is neither a blockbuster prequel nor a sequel. Nobody gives a bad performance. Indeed, Wright surrounds his handsome, earnest, young leading man, Ansel Elgort of 'Divergent,' with a robust cast, featuring Jamie Fox, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Kevin Spacey. Jamie Fox and Jon Hamm are unforgettable as a pair of unhinged hoodlums who abhor each other, while Kevin Spacey towers above both as the wily mastermind of all the film's crimes. Clearly, something about Edgar Wright's tale of mayhem and murder appealed to these Hollywood veterans, and they indulge in being both evil and obnoxious. Honorable mention goes to behind-the-scenes veteran stunt coordinator Darrin Prescott of 'John Wick' fame as well as the hundred or more precision drivers, riggers, camera bike riders, and stunt doubles who helped him orchestrate several harrowing but realistic driving sequences that never turn into the bizarre tomfooleries of the 'Transporter' movies. Hey, I loved the 'Transporter' movies, but 'Baby Driver' strives to keep things realistic.Baby (Ansel Elgort of 'The Fault in Our Stars') is a fearless, young hellion with a taste of tunes and reckless driving that converge once he takes the wheel of any vehicle. He survived a traumatic childhood after his contentious mother and father slammed their car into the rear of a tractor-trailer and died. Baby escaped grievous bodily harm. Nevertheless, he carries a couple of token scars on above an eyebrow and across his cheek. Wright sketches in Baby's background when he doesn't replay the scene of the accident that killed his parents. Meantime, he spent his teen years stealing cars and keeping the Atlanta Police in his rearview mirror. At the same time, he became a wizard with recording music in any format and grooves to his iPod whenever he careens around town to drown out 'the hum in his drum' caused by tinnitus. Writer & director Edgar Wright provides us with a protagonist both sympathetic and charming. Baby doesn't brag, he just drives, and when he holds onto the wheel, he can go anywhere--if there is anywhere to go. Literally, he can thread the eye of a needle in his stick-shift cars, and he can escape from predicaments that seem well-nigh impossible. Initially, we see Baby drive the getaway car after a bank robbery, and he leads the Atlanta Police on a spectacular chase. Afterward, while the well-tailored criminal mastermind, Doc (Kevin Spacey of 'The Usual Suspects'), is dividing up the loot, one of the robbers, Griff (Jon Bernthal of 'The Accountant'), minimizes Baby's role in the hold-up. Griff warns Baby that one way or another Baby will wind up with blood on his hands. We learn from Wright's fast-paced, expository dialogue that Doc discovered Baby because he stole Doc's Mercedes. Since that incident, Doc has used Baby as his wheel-man. Moreover, Doc keeps him on his payroll so the energetic rapscallion can pay off his debt to him. Basically, 'Baby Driver' boils down to a morality yarn about a young thief who doesn't want to see anybody die during the commission of a crime. Unlike the rest of the characters in 'Baby Driver,' Baby is the only one with a shred of decency. The sobering but exasperating thing about Baby is that he doesn't elude the long arm of the law every time and that makes him more believable and vulnerable. Fortunately, few of Baby's asphalt antics are so impractical that they could be considered preposterous. After an exhilarating opening sequence where our hero delivers Doc's accomplices without a scratch, Baby embarks on an odyssey that alters his life. Primarily, Baby falls in love with a cute, young waitress at a 24-hour diner where he likes to drink java. Debora (Lily James of 'Cinderella') walks into Baby's life and she turns him every which way but loose. Once he has repaid Doc for everything that he took from him when he stole his car, Baby plans to quit crime. In fact, he is on the straight and narrow and delivering orders for Goodfellas Pizza when Doc crosses his path again and convinces him to come back and drive for him. 'Baby Driver' boasts some of the best, high-speed driving sequences since the crime thriller 'Drive' (2011) with Ryan Gosling. The thieves conspiring with Doc are a cynical, ruthless bunch who would prefer to exit in a blaze of gunfire than submit meekly to the rehabilitative options of the criminal justice system. Wright ramps up all this anarchy with a dynamic but diverse variety of tunes that Baby listens to according to the occasion. The hit songs in 'Baby Driver' are reminiscent of those in the two 'Guardians of the Galaxy' sci-fi space operas. Consequently, Ansel Elgort should be on the road to superstardom, because nothing about 'Baby Driver' is infantile.",8,10,17,22 July 2017
Justice League," Superman Is BACK!!!
","'Justice League' is a slam-bang, smash-up saga, but it doesn't surpass last year's 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice.' Mind you, as entertaining as 'Justice League' is, it isn't as exhilarating as Marvel's most recent 'Thor: Ragnarok.' At this point, the cliché about apples and oranges crop up. The DC Cinematic Universe differs from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nevertheless, despite their intrinsic differences, comparisons are inevitable. I grew up reading DC Comics and preferred them over Marvel Comics. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers hasn't scored the same critical and commercial success that New Line Cinema, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, and Walt Disney have with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ironically, Warner Brothers made history when it released the first 'Batman' (1989) with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, but the esteemed studio—Warner Brothers introduced sound movies--hasn't maintained the consistency and charisma that distinguishes the Marvel Cinematic Universe.For the record, the first Marvel property to illuminate the silver screen was 'Captain America' (1944), but it was a 15-chapter, black & white, Saturday afternoon, Republic Studios serial. DC Comics still beat its competitor to the screen with Columbia's release of the 15-chapter 'Batman' serial in 1943 and followed it up with a 1949 serial sequel. Later, these serials inspired Twentieth Century Fox's live-action 'Batman' television series, co-starring Adam West & Burt Ward, that aired from 1966 to 1968. Initially, the Marvel Cinematic Universe stumbled at the get-go with 'Howard the Duck' (1986) as well as the straight-to-video versions of 'The Punisher' (1989) and 'Captain America' (1990). New Line Cinema's 'Blade' (1998), Twentieth Century Fox's 'X-Men' (2000), and Columbia's 'Spider-Man' (2000) struck pay-dirt on the big-screen. Disney has since appropriated the MCU from Paramount Pictures, and they have made it a cornerstone of their studio. Ultimately, the DC Cinematic Universe doesn't have anybody like Stan Lee, the venerable Marvel Comics' publisher and chairman who everybody recognizes and adores with his cameo appearance. Moreover, Warner's has not been able to duplicate its stunning back-to-back success with 'Batman V Superman' and 'Wonder Woman.' The biggest problems facing 'Justice League' are its $300-million price tag and its $150-million advertising campaign. Meaning, just because 'Justice League' is a good movie, doesn't mean that it will triple its investment like 'Batman V Superman' and 'Wonder Woman.' 'Suicide Squad' was no slouch either with worldwide receipts amounting to over $745-million.Meantime, any movie that resurrects the Last Son of Krypton can't be all bad. 'Watchman' director Zack Snyder and scenarists Chris Terrio of 'Batman Vs Superman' and Joss Whedon of 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' have not only brought Superman back from the grave, but they have also ushered the Flash/Barry Allen, Aquaman/Arthur Curry, and Cyborg/Victor Stone into the fray. Some may be disappointed to learn that this Flash (Ezra Miller) isn't the same Flash (Grant Gustin) in the WB's television series. Furthermore, Snyder and company shun frivolous romantic subplots since they have more than enough to keep them busy with the newest superheroes. Clocking in at two high-octane hours, 'Justice League' doesn't dawdle Surprisingly, even with Joss Whedon aboard, 'Justice League' qualifies as strictly by-the-numbers with few surprises. The first third dispatches Bruce Wayne (former 'Daredevil' Ben Affleck) to recruit Barry Allen, Arthur Curry, and Victor Stone because an intimidating the ancient extraterrestrial villain threatening Earth—Steppenwolf (voice of Ciarán Hinds)—is more than the Dark Knight can handle. Says Wayne to Aquaman, 'I believe that an enemy is coming from far away. I'm looking for warriors. I'm building an alliance to defend us.' Steppenwolf looks and sounds sufficiently malevolent. This wicked superhuman warrior wields a nasty electro-axe and invades Earth with an army of google-eyed airborne predators called Parademons. Before he sets off in search of the new superheroes, Bruce Wayne reacquaints himself with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot of 'Wonder Woman'). She sneaks into his ultra-security equipped Bat Cave without tripping off any alarms. Reluctantly, Allen, Curry, and Stone agree to join up, but Aquaman/Arthur Curry isn't impressed initially with Bruce Wayne. 'What's your super power,' the oceanic warrior asks. 'I'm rich,' replies Wayne.Unlike 'Thor: Ragnarok,' 'Justice League' confines its humor to clever dialogue quips. At one point, Alfred Pennyworth (Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons of 'Reversal of Fortune') remarks to Wayne, 'I miss the days when one's biggest concern is exploding wind-up penguins.' This doesn't keep the Flash from enlivening the action with his fleet-footed frolics. Ultimately, once the Justice League has assembled, and Steppenwolf has uttered his ultimatum, the second third ensues with the resurrection of Superman (Henry Cavill of 'Man of Steel'), but he isn't particularly pleased with the Caped Crusader and what happened in 'Batman Vs Superman.' Wayne keeps a secret weapon in his arsenal to lure Kal-El back into the fold. Unless you've skipped Superman's earlier exploits in 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman Vs Superman,' you should be able to guess what Batman has that can change Superman's mind. Death hasn't been too traumatic for Clark Kent. He has managed to preserve his magnificently muscled physique along with his incandescent laser-beam eyes. The final third pits the League against Steppenwolf, and this obnoxious hellion doesn't go quietly into that good night. Of course, you know that the Justice League will thwart Steppenwolf, but he doesn't go down with a fight.The biggest letdown about 'Justice League' are the segments that introduce the various superheroes. Surely, Snyder and his writers, particularly Joss Whedon, could have conjured up something more exciting and less generic. The confrontation between Wonder Woman and a criminal gang planning to plunge the world back into the Stone Age lacks the 'wow' factor. The same goes for the other superheroes. Batman unveils some impressive gadgets, namely 'the nightcrawler.' Snyder relies again on CGI galore, as he did in 'Batman Vs Superman,' but this is not surprising considering it depicts larger-than-life heroes and villains who perform the impossible. Altogether, despite its predictable plotting, 'Justice League' delivers action aplenty and doesn't wear out its welcome.",8,1,2,28 November 2017
Man of Steel," Up And Away The Best Superman Epic!!!
","'Man of Steel' ranks as the best Superman movie about the Last Son of Krypton. After the lackluster box office response to the flawed but entertaining 'Superman Returns' back in 2006, Warner Brothers and D.C. Comics must have retreated into their own collective Fortress of Solitude to contemplate the future of the Man of Tomorrow. Clearly, since he received story credit, writer & producer Christopher Nolan played a part in shaping this Superman reboot. As the genius behind the hugely profitable Christian Bale 'Dark Knight' trilogy, Nolan qualified as the ideal choice to guide the thinking behind the reboot. If you've seen Nolan's 'Batman' movies, you'll spot his influence on 'Man of Steel.' First, like Nolan's 'Batman' epics, 'Man of Steel' deplores comic relief and holds humor to a minimum. Comparatively, 'Man of Steel' is nothing like the glib 'Iron Man 3.' Second, Clark Kent ventures out into the world incognito like Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne did in 'Batman Begins.' Clark holds down several jobs before he dons his distinctive apparel and then plays everything straight. 'Smallville' fans will appreciate this rite of passage, especially the scene at the truck stop. 'Watchman' director Zack Snyder and 'Blade' scenarist David S. Goyer rely on Nolan-like flashbacks to break up the monotony of the action. Clocking in at 143 minutes, 'Man of Steel' maintains a sense of spontaneity that enlivens its formulaic plot. Third, this Superman movie boasts no more connection with the previous Superman outings than Nolan's 'Batman' movies had with the earlier 'Batman' franchise. Fourth, just as Nolan changed the way that the Caped Crusader appeared, Superman doesn't dress up like he does in the comics. For example, Superman doesn't wear drawers outside his outfit, and he cavorts around in the equivalent of dye- blue thermal underwear. Nevertheless, Superman hangs onto his cape. These alterations make 'Man of Steel' a better movie than if would have been had Warner Brothers adhered to the 'Superman Returns' chronology.Genre movies, such as westerns, crime thrillers, and horror chillers, rely on surefire narrative formulas, and 'Superman' movies are no different. Not only do good genre movies strive to top each other, but they also modify themselves so they can maintain their universal appeal. Superman appeared first in 1938 in Action Comics. Since his debut, the Man of Tomorrow has evolved. Other media outlets have adapted him and conjured up new ideas about the character. For example, the radio show introduced kryptonite in 1943 as the substance that imperiled Superman. 'Man of Steel' adopts a traditional but at the same time a revisionist approach to its subject matter. Like 'Superman' (1978), 'Man of Steel' opens with Superman's origins as the son of Jor-El on the dying planet of Krypton. Unlike 'Superman' (1978), 'Man of Steel' expands considerably the Krypton sequence. Snyder and Goyer establish the enmity between Jor-El and the treacherous Krypton military commander General Zod (Michael Shannon of 'Mud') who hates him with a passion. Oscar-winning Russell Crowe of 'Gladiator' portrays Superman's father Jor-El in a performance of commendable restraint. He engages Zod in armed combat from the back of an exotic animal. Cleverly, the filmmakers have devised an imaginative way to retain Jor-El's presence beyond the opening battle on Krypton. The Krypton battle scenes amount to a mini-epic with homages to both 'Star Wars' and 'John Carter.' 'Man of Steel' provides three times more spectacle here before it plunges our hero into his 'Smallville' years. Clark struggles with great difficulty to conceal his identity while his proud foster parents Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner of 'Wyatt Earp') and Martha Kent (Diane Lane of 'Hollywoodland') stand by him. The scene where he prevents a school bus from sinking into a river after it topples from a bridge is memorable. Jonathan Kent's death—he doesn't succumb to a heart attack as he did in 'Superman' (1948), the 'Superman on Earth' episode from the 1952 'Superman' television series, or 'Superman' (1978)—differs, but Snyder and Goyer make it a poignant statement about him. Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams of 'Enchanted') becomes interested in the exploits of a nomadic troubleshooter after he saves her life. He comes to her rescue while she is in the Arctic investigating an enigmatic spaceship in the ice. Eventually, Lois tracks him down to Smallville and begs him to let her write about him. Clark wants nobody to know about him. Lois' editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne of 'The Matrix') refuses to print her story about a stranger from another world. Ironically, while no human can convince Clark Kent to divulge his secret identify as Superman, General Zod forces him to come out into the open. Compliantly, Superman surrenders himself to the authorities of Earth and allows them to clap hand-cuffs on him! 'Man of Steel' synthesizes the first two Christopher Reeve movies by imprisoning the dastardly General Zod in a Phantom Zone and then allowing him to escape. Zod and his minions show up out of the blue and insist Earth give up Kal-El. At this point, we Earthlings don't know who to trust. When it comes down to a clash, Zod and Kal-El both constitute targets of opportunity for our military. The Army fires millions of rounds in Zod's minions without seriously inconveniencing them. British actor Henry Cavill is the sixth to play an adult Superman. You may have seen him in 'Immortals,' 'Tristan + Isolde,' and 'Cold Light of Day.' Ironically, he auditioned for the Clark Kent role in 'Superman Returns.' Cavill looks every inch like Superman, with his muscular physique ripped and chiseled like Michelangelo's David. Happily, he doesn't impersonate Christopher Reeve like Brandon Routh. The closest Superman actor that Cavill comes to imitating is George Reeves from the 1952 television series. Cavill has his head screwed on properly, and his Superman is no coy poster boy. Of course, if you're yearning for something more like 'Superman' (1978) or 'Superman Returns' (2006), you're going to hate the 'Man of Steel.'",10,6,12,30 June 2013
Grease," Slick!
","This toe-tapping high school musical homage to the 1950s toplining John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John epitomizes nostalgia like few movies can with top pop tunes and hip-wiggling choreography. Basically, the Bronte Woodard screenplay of the Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey stage musical recycles the venerable boy gets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl back formula. Of course, in Hollywood, everybody is eternally youthful, even when they are well past their high school prime. Rydell High is the setting for all these shenanigans, with Principal McGee (Eva Arden) presiding over the likes of Danny Zuko (John Travolta), Rizzo (Stockard Channing), Kenickie (Jeff Conaway), Frenchy, (Didi Conn), Eugene (Eddie Deezen), and Tom (Lorenzo Lamas). The action opens to the strains of Love Is A Many Splendid Thing on the beach as the summer sunset sets on a whirlwind romance between Danny and Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) who has to return to Australia. Little does she know that she will not be going back down under and winds up at Rydell High where she encounters Danny. Like most teenagers in high school, the guys have to posture when they are not running their combs through their grease-soaked coiffures. Danny leads a black-leather jacket clad gang called the T-Birds and their sworn enemies are the scorpions. This fierce rivalry smolders throughout the action while Kenickie takes an old jalopy and overhauls it. Kenickie and his squeeze Rizzo eventually break up when she fears that she may be pregnant and one of the Scorpions (Dennis Stewart) challenges Kenickie to a drag race for pink slips, i.e. ownership papers of the car that loses. At the last minute, Kenickie has to back and Danny takes the wheel. Just as Sandy and Danny are warming up to each other, Rydell High becomes the site of a nationally televised dance contest with Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes) acting as the Emcee. Danny takes Sandy but he winds up dancing with feisty Cha Cha DiGregorio (Annette Charles) and winning the contest. Sandy breaks up with Danny, but they are back together for the finale. The chemistry between Travolta and Newton-John is sizzling with their singing finale as a corker. GREASE pays tribute to many seminal 50s films, such as 'Ben-Hur,' during an automobile race. The performances are fine and the music is memorable.",10,0,3,1 December 2011
Footloose," A Toe-Tapping Cult Masterpiece
","Kevin Bacon plays a rebel with a cause in 'Steel Magnolias' director Herbert Ross's teenage dance musical 'Footloose.' Our high school age hero arouses the wrath of the city fathers when he tries to abolish a certain sacred city ordinance. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Ren MacCormack finds himself uprooted when his mom returns to her rural hometown of Bomont, Utah, after her husband abandons her. This oppressive Utah town bans rock 'n roll music, high school dancing sans chaperons, and students out past curfew. The status quo also frowns on 'inappropriate' literature, specifically 'Slaughterhouse-Five,' and they have fired English teachers for assigning controversial books like the Kurt Vonnegut novel. If our fish-out-of-water protagonist didn't have a hard enough time, Ren must contend with a righteous, killjoy, minister, the latter's rebellious daughter, the local constabulary, and haughty high school administrators. This lively PG-rated tale contains some profanity, a men's locker room shower scene with bare bottoms, examples of suicidal behavior, and some of the most memorable pop tunes from the 1980s. Indeed, the Kenny Loggins' song 'Footloose' and the Tom Snow song 'Let's Hear it for the Boy' received Academy Award nominations for best original music. Lyricist Dean Pitchford co-wrote both songs with Loggins and Snow in addition to penning the screenplay. Earlier, Pitchford shared an Oscar statute with Michael Gore for the Best Song for 'Fame.' After Ren MacCormack arrives in Bomont, he learns to his chagrin that he can get in trouble for playing loud music in his yellow Volkswagen Beetle. No sooner has Ren shown up for school than he encounters his first critic, Willard Hewitt (Christopher Penn of 'True Romance'), but they wind up become pals despite their vast differences. Meanwhile, the preacher's daughter Ariel Moore (Lori Singer of 'Summer Heat') and her best friend Rusty (Sarah Jessica Parker of 'Sex and the City') like what they see because Ren doesn't dress like everybody else. These gals aren't the only ones making eyes at Ren. His uncle's adolescent daughter Amy calls Ren 'a fox' and wants to give him a potato at diner. Unfortunately for Ren, he runs afoul of Ariel's hell-raising boyfriend Chuck Cranston (Jim Youngs of 'Hotshot') and his marijuana puffing pals and Chuck challenges Ren to a game of chicken at his father's property where they drive tractors at each other with Ren on a John Deere and Chuck a Dual. Ren's sneaker shoestring get snagged and he cannot bail out. This stroke of luck prompted Chuck to bail out first and Ren wins. As it turns out, Ariel is a hellion herself. Early in the action, she straddles Chuck's pick-up truck and her friend's car as they race down a two-lane blacktop highway with an 18-wheeler bearing down on them. This is one of the most exciting scenes in 'Footloose.' Later, Ariel plays chicken with a train and Ren has to knock her out of the way at the last minute. Anyway, one of Chuck's friends try to get Ren in trouble in school by slipping him a marijuana joint and a school faculty member spots the joint in Ren's fingers. He chases Ren into a toilet stall but is too late to confiscate the evidence. This entire scene is handled more adeptly in the remake. Eventually, Ren decides to take Ariel, Rusty, and Willard out of town to a bar where dancing is allowed and he learns that Willard cannot dance a lick. When Ren decides to change the city ordinance against dancing, he challenges Willard to learn how to dance. Meanwhile, Reverend Moore slaps his hellion of a daughter during an argument and sets his own wife, Vi Moore (Dianne Wiest of 'The Lost Boys'), against him. She challenges Shaw to improve his one-on-one skills. You see, the Reverend has been a power broker in Bomont in that he helped pass the ordinance forbidding dancing and cacophonous music. Secretly, Shaw finds himself struggling to be a Sheppard watching over the town. Sadly, for Ren, his petition to change the no dancing law fails, but he is approached by his boss who runs the The Lehi Rollermills, a flour mill just outside the Bomont City limits. They fix up the mill and arrange to have the dance there. On the night of the dance, after the Moores have allowed Ariel to attend, Chuck and his cronies show up to spoil things, but they run into more than they asked for and get solidly whipped. Part of the beauty of 'Footloose' is that Ren doesn't get to change the city ordinance, but he is permitted to throw his dance. Reverend Moore emerges as a round character because he changes during the process and asks for God's blessings and prayers to guide the youth while they are at the dance.Director Herb Ross doesn't wear out his welcome with this quasi-melodramatic, 107-minute opus, and the cast delivers strong performances. Several barely known thespians who shined aside from the leaping and lunging Bacon were future 'Sex in the City' starlet Sarah Jessica Parker, Sean Penn's late brother Christopher, and John Lithgow as the minister who astonished audiences with his work in 'Terms of Endearment.' Budgeted at a mere $8 million, 'Footloose' reportedly coined over $80 million at the box office. 'Footloose' was one of a number of hit movies loaded with a Top-40 play list, like 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Flashdance' that stormed theaters in the 1980s when MTV was changing the way people looked and listened to music. Hard as it is to believable, 'Footloose' was almost shot down before it was released. Furthermore, Kevin Bacon was not the studio's first choice. Indeed, Madonna auditioned for the role that Lori Singer wound up playing.",10,2,5,20 October 2011
28 Weeks Later," Dead On Arrival . . .
","Zombie movies are a dime a dozen nowadays, and the latest zombie movie '28 Weeks Later' isn't worth a dime. Technically, '28 Weeks Later' qualifies as a sequel of sorts to British director Danny Boyle's 2002 zombie chiller '28 Days Later.' In '28 Days Later,' a botched laboratory experiment on animals unleashed a deadly virus that mutated humans into frenzied flesh-feasting maniacs on the rampage in the United Kingdom. None of the original cast survives to reprise their roles in Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's follow-up epic that he penned with three other scenarists Rowan Joffe, Enrique Lopez Lavigne, and Jesus Olmo. Original writer Alex Garland and Boyle serve only as producers, but apparently they felt confident enough about Fresnadillo to give the Spaniard a free hand. Indeed, the situation has changed dramatically from the first film. If movies were rated strictly on production values, '28 Weeks Later' would be a top-notch spine-tingler, but the monolithic plot and the dire lack of originality cripple this giddy chiller. The first scene that introduces us to the predicament of leading man Robert Carlyle promises more than the rest of the film can deliver. The exception to the rule is one scene where a U.S. Army helicopter flies low enough with its rotor blades acting as scythes to devastate a horde of zombies scrambling feverishly across an open field. This is about as fresh as this grisly yarn can get. The action degenerates into one hair-raising chase after another on foot, by car, by chopper, etc., with snarling zombies in hot pursuit with nothing to differentiate it from the countless other zombie movies out there. Worst, there's really nobody to either identify with and everybody pretty much gets bitten and turned into zombies.'28 Weeks Later' opens serenely enough in an isolated English farmhouse where a group of survivors hide out in relative peace. Husband Don Harris (Robert Carlyle of 'The World Is Not Enough') and his wife Scarlet (Rose Byrne) are sharing the premises with another couple when somebody knocks at their door. They let the latest survivor--a child in--and set about feeding him when out of nowhere a horde of zombie burst to attack the house and literally rip it apart. During this melee, Don and Scarlet are separated, but Don can do nothing to save Scarlet. As the zombies charge after him, it is all Don can do to save his own skin and his escape is pretty narrow. After this explosive opener, '28 Weeks Later' goes about its business bringing audiences up to date on the latest events. You have to read several captions to grasp the current predicament. Fifteen days after the initial outbreak, the authorities quarantined mainland Britain. The rage virus decimated the population some 28 days later. Eleven weeks afterward, a U.S.-led NATO force arrived in London, and 18 weeks later, this force confirmed that the country was 'free' of infection. NATO forces along with the returning civilian population began rebuilding twenty-four weeks later, and twenty-eight weeks later these citizens started their lives anew within the confines of a niche of the city. Snipers are stationed everywhere in case zombies reappear and helicopters with machine guns patrol the city.At this point, Don is reunited with his two children, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), who had been earlier relocated to safety on the Spanish mainland. They inquire about their mother, and Don cringes with guilt as he tries to explain that he had to abandon her. Don's kids are curious, and they sneak off into the forbidden zone to check out their old home. Miraculously, they discover their mother, and the authorities lock up Rose to conduct tests on her because she appears unscathed from the ordeal. An Army medical expert believes that Rose may hold the solution to curing the plague since she hasn't mutated into a zombie. Meanwhile, the authorities have given Don special privileges to assist them. Incredibly, those special privileges extend to giving him a key that allows him access into any secure area. He visits Scarlet and kisses her and promptly contracts the plague. It's a little hard to believe that the authorities would have given Don such freedom, but it is also hard to believe that Rose could have escaped without a scratch.Afterward, Don pursues his kids and an Army sniper who is trying to lead them to safety. '28 Weeks Later' turns into a mindless melodrama that tries to milk this predicament for all the adrenaline that it can, but it gets tiresome after the first chase and goes downhill. Predictably, '28 Weeks Later' ends with a set-up for a sequel which will hopefully not illuminate the big screen anytime soon.",2,5,10,14 June 2007
The Thing," John Carpenter's Undisputed Masterpiece!!!
","Anybody who knows anything about horror director John Carpenter knows how much he idolizes not only Howard Hawks but also the 1951 sci-fi chiller 'The Thing from Another World' about an alien that tangles with a group of scientists who accidentally thaw out the creature out. Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella 'Who Goes There?' (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes. 'The Thing' is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising, and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense, humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in. Before long things start to happen. Kurt Russell stars a MacReedy, a rough and tough helicopter pilot who nurses Jack Daniels throughout the movie and wears a hilarious Yosemite Sam Stetson. Not to be missed. Lots of suspenseful situations.",10,7,9,15 October 2011
The Revenant," An Unforgettable Epic!!!
","Webster's Dictionary defines the word 'revenant' as 'one that returns after death or a long absence.' This word summarizes accurately the adversity that Oscar-nominated actor Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass confronts in 'Birdman' director Alejandro González Iñárritu's 'The Revenant,' an unforgettable frontier yarn set in early 1820's America. Struggling against virtually insuperable odds to stay alive after a mama bear mauls him, Hugh Glass watches in horror when his own comrades abandon him for dead. Glass' mind-boggling battle for survival occurred during an ill-fated trapping expedition in what is now South Dakota. Grizzly not only describes the formidable female bear that attacks Glass, but also the obstacles that Glass must conquer during his desperate fight to get back to civilization and wreak vengeance. Although this gorgeously-lensed movie is based in part on Michael Punke's 2002 novel, the real Hugh Glass was a celebrated contemporary of fellow mountain men Jedediah Smith and Grizzly Adams. Glass led an adventurous life as a smuggler, ship's captain, pirate, frontiersman, trapper, fur trader, hunter, and explorer. Oscar-nominated Mexican director Iñárritu dwells on this chapter of Glass' extraordinary life, and he surrounds DiCaprio with a brawny supporting cast. You've never seen 'The Wolf of Wall Street' like you see him in 'The Revenant,' and the closest DiCaprio movie to feature such a dreadful predicament is the historical French costume drama 'The Man in the Iron Mask.' Tom Hardy, who played both Max in 'Mad Max Fury Road' and Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises,' makes a despicable villain that you will abhor with a passion. The majestic scenery that serves as a backdrop for this epic journey makes the hero and the villain seem larger-than-life as they negotiate a landscape rife with peril. Iñárritu spent nine months shooting 'The Revenant' in chronological order at a variety of scenic locations in British Columbia, Montana, San Francisco, and finally Argentina. Oscar-nominated cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and he shot this masterpiece using only natural light to heighten the authenticity.As 'The Revenant' unfolds, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson of 'Ex Machina') of the Rocky Mountain Trading Company has hired Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio of 'Inception') to serve as a scout for a fur trapping expedition. Things take a turn for the worse early on as savage Arikara Indians attack their camp. Many of the trappers die in the fracas, and Glass suggests that they return to their Fort Kiowa headquarters by an overland route. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy of 'Lawless'), a thoroughly obnoxious trapper from Texas, hates the idea, but he goes along reluctantly with it. Meantime, while he is out foraging for food, Glass spots two bawling bear cubs and then sees their aggressive mother. This pugnacious bear launches herself at Glass and turns him every which way but loose. Mind you, Glass manages to squeeze off one shot from his single-shot rifle before the bear tears into him and devastates our hero with her six-inch razor-sharp claws. Eventually, the wounded bear succumbs to Glass' bullet, and our hero finishes the beast off with a huge knife. Captain Henry orders his men build a stretcher for Glass, but the expedition halts when the terrain prevents them from carrying Glass any farther. Moreover, the woebegone Glass appears in such ghastly condition that Henry feels certain he will die. He promises extra pay to anybody who will stick around until Glass dies and give him a Christian burial. Fitzgerald and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter of 'The Maze Runner') both volunteer to stay with Glass until the inevitable. Naturally, Glass' Pawnee Indian son Hawk (newcomer Forrest Goodluck) refuses to desert his dad. Eventually, Fitzgerald grows impatient with Glass when he doesn't die. Not only does he kill Hawk, but also he tries to bury Glass alive. Fearing for his own life, Bridger accommodates Fitzgerald's disloyalty. Miraculously, Glass survives and embarks upon an incredible journey to reach civilization and pay back Fitzgerald for his treachery. For the record, 'The Revenant' is the third movie about Glass's astonishing exploits. The first movie was 'Vanishing Point' director Richard C. Sarafian's 'Man in the Wilderness' (1971) with Irish actor Richard Harris as the resilient hunter who lived through a bear attack, but his fellow trappers left him behind to die in isolation. While the character that Harris portrayed in 'Man in the Wilderness' was called Zachary Bass, the Bass character was based largely on Hugh Glass and his legendary exploits. 'Man in the Wilderness' ranks as an above-average adventure narrative, but it isn't half as good as Iñárritu's 'The Revenant.' Far more abysmal is the hopelessly inferior 'Apache Blood' (1975), the second cinematic account of Glass's grizzly encounter. Vern Piehl spread himself too thin as producer, director, and cinematographer on this mediocre reenactment. In Piehl's saddle-sore cavalry versus the Indians saga, a veteran army scout named Sam Glass tangles with a bear and emerges the worse for wear. 'Man in the Wilderness' simulated the bear attack with an actual bear wrestling with its trainer. In the amateurish 'Apache Blood,' the bear attacks the scout as he is refilling his canteen. The actor gropes somebody in a bear costume. The mauling in 'The Revenant' looks far more realistic despite the conspicuous CGI work involved behind the scenes to replicate the savage event. Primarily, 'Man in the Wilderness,' 'Apache Blood,' and 'The Revenant' follow the same plot line. Our indestructible protagonist suffers at the claws of a furious mama bear, and everybody deems him dead for the long haul. Punke's novel as well as all three films follow the plot up to that point. In all four adaptations, Glass's companions betray him. Villainous Percy Herbert betrayed Richard Harris in 'Man in the Wilderness.' Cowardly cavalry troopers left Glass to fend for himself in 'Apache Blood.' Tom Hardy displays no loyalty to DiCaprio in 'The Revenant.' Occasionally, the action slows down because our protagonist wanders alone in desolation. Nevertheless, 'The Revenant' qualifies as a stunning film that deserves all twelve of its Oscar nominations.",10,2,7,26 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," One of Clint's Best!!!
","Clint Eastwood provides another variation on his grumpy old man act in freshman director Robert Lorenz's 'Trouble with the Curve,' a captivating saga about an aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout whose contract is up for renewal. This PG-13 Eastwood epic is one of the few where Clint doesn't brandish a firearm to solve his problems. He does have a scene in a southern bar where he threatens to slash a drunkard's throat with a shattered beer bottle for getting fresh with his grown-up daughter. The rest of the time, he grimaces, squints, and carries on like a crotchety old man. As it turns out, he is cast as an old man with ailing eyes and an attitude. Part of his attitude emerges from doing things the old-fashioned way. He scouts players by attending games in Podunk towns galore and listening to the sound that the baseball makes as it breezes through the air. Comparatively, 'Trouble with the Curve' pits Clint against younger guys who prefer to base their scouting decisions strictly on the statistics that they juggle on their laptops. Basically, this movie concerns the generation gap and the difference between the way men conduct business with either first-hand information or second-hand information. 'Trouble with the Curve' amounts to the baseball rebuttal to the Brad Pitt movie 'Money Ball.' Although you know what is going to happen before it does in this pleasing but poignant picture about baseball scouts, 'Trouble with the Curve' has a lot of balls and throws them in a variety of ways. Amy Adams co-stars as Clint's adult daughter who has spent most of her life away from her single father living with relatives. Part of the conflict occurs between the two have been apart so long that they don't function together well when they are in each other's company.",10,6,12,28 September 2012
Bridge of Spies," Triumph of Spies!!!
","Historians have chronicled the events during the intervening fifty-three years in director Steven Spielberg's gripping Cold War thriller 'Bridge of Spies,' so little comes as a complete surprise. Despite the conspicuous absence of suspense, this lavishly produced, persuasively acted, and thoroughly engrossing film remains utterly captivating. Working from a screenplay by Matt Charman, rewritten by Joel and Ethan Cohen of 'Fargo' fame, Spielberg makes largely minor departures from the actual occurrences as they unfolded and recreates history with atmospheric spontaneity. Tom Hanks plays the congenial central character in this literate chess game of international espionage that opens with the arrest of a Soviet spy in America and culminates on a lonely Berlin bridge at dawn with rival world superpowers swapping the spy for captured U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. Spielberg doesn't squander a second in this literate narrative and shoehorns a plethora of action into 135 minutes without resorting to glamorous heroics and gratuitous pyrotechnics. Everybody always raves about the magnitude of story above all else, and 'Bridge of Spies' exemplifies why a good, solid story—even one that has been well-documented in the international press at the time—can still yield an immensely entertaining film. Each character stands out dramatically, and each has been etched with sympathy so we are concerned about their situation. At the heart of the matter, 'Bridge of Spies' emerges as a realistic, bona fide 'Mission Impossible' outing when you consider all the variables that the unseen hand of fate brought to the table. What makes it doubly interesting is that only a singular incident like this could have ushered these individuals into each other's company.'Bridge of Spies' unfolds with the FBI arresting Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance of 'Prospero's Books') in Brooklyn during 1957. Abel had maintained a low-profile as one of the top Soviet spies in America. Masquerading as an artist, he collected sensitive information without calling attention to himself. The Soviets relied on what are known as dead letter mail boxes. Information could be stashed and retrieved, without it being apparent to most people, in innocuous places. Abel sat on a bench one day to paint a picture of a bridge. As he adjusted his easel, he felt under the bench and found a hollowed coin containing a coded message. Later, after the Feds raided his studio apartment, Abel destroyed the message under their noses while they ransacked his premises for incriminating evidence. At this point, Brooklyn insurance claims attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks of 'Forrest Gump') enters the arena. The corporate law firm where he is a partner informs him that the New York Bar Association wants him to serve as Abel's pro-bono counsel so nobody can impugn American justice. Mind you, everybody but Donovan considers Abel's conviction a foregone conclusion. Of course, he concedes he has been chosen to defend the most hated man in America. 'Everyone will hate me,' Donovan laments, 'but at least I'll lose.' Neither Donovan's wife, Mary (Amy Ryan of 'Capote'), nor his children share his principles. Nevertheless, Donovan goes into court swinging with everything that he has, and he discovers the deck has been stacked against him. Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews of 'Thirteen Days') refuses to grant Donovan adequate time to prepare Abel's defense. Later, when Donovan advises Byers that the FBI had no search warrant so all the evidence should be banned, the judge ignores him. Inevitably, despite his noble efforts, Donovan cannot clear Abel. Later, Donovan visits the judge at his honor's residence and persuades the crusty old jurist to display some compassion and sentence the Soviet to prison rather than the electric chair. Byers heeds Donovan's advice despite frenzied public opinion after he delivers his verdict.In the meantime, the CIA recruits U.S.A.F. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell of 'Whiplash') to fly a high altitude jet to conduct aerial reconnaissance over the U.S.S.R. A Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile cripples Power's plane. He bails out, but fails to obliterate his U2 plane. Of course, the Soviet capture Powers, convict him as a spy, and sentence him to prison. Not long afterward, Donovan receives a letter from the Soviets and finds himself flying to Berlin as a private citizen to negotiate a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers. Donovan gets the royal runaround between the Soviets as well as the East Berlin authorities. Nonetheless, he proves himself to be a shrewd man with a bargain, and he pits the Soviets against East Berlin. Ultimately, he never gives ground during these complicated negotiations. The catch is he must negotiate between the superpowers as a private individual rather than an official American envoy. Read Donovan's insightful memoir 'Strangers on the Bridge,' and you'll acquire a new appreciation for this crafty attorney.Hanks brings a jovial, 'aw shucks' Jimmy Stewart charm to his portrayal of Donovan. Literally, 'Bridge of Spies' could be seen as 'Mr. Smith Goes to Berlin.' Hanks looks like a paunchy, unassuming figure without a clue, but he emerges as the sharpest tack in the box. Donovan's history is pretty amazing when you think about what he accomplished. Meantime, Mark Rylance distinguishes himself as Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and he overshadows Hanks with a 'less is more' performance. Repeatedly, Donovan makes comments about Abel's apparent lack of anxiety. Facing certain death, the imperturbable Abel refuses to let the pressure affect him. 'Would it help?' he queries Donovan to worry about his fate. Austin Stowell reminded me of cub reporter Jimmy Olsen from the 1950s' 'Superman' TV show. He embodies the wholesome, clean-cut, but ambitious American who refuses to commit suicide and struggles to make the best of a dreadful predicament.Spielberg does an exceptional job of condensing and cross-cutting these events. Budgeted at $40 million, 'Bridge of Spies' looks authentic with its multiple locations in American and Europe. Indisputably, 'Bridge of Spies' couldn't have been produced during the Cold War because objectivity would have been harshly compromised. Spielberg's historical reenactment is relevant because contemporary American democracy faces similar challenges.",10,12,25,26 October 2015
Pitch Black," Gripping Sci-FI Thriler
","Director David Twohy and scenarists Ken & Jim Wheat have fashioned a grim, claustrophobic but exciting sci-fi, horror chiller about a commercial vessel in space that is struck by meteor shower. Not only is the ship Hunter-Gratzner knocked out of its shipping lane, but also the captain dies. The spacecraft crash lands on a desolate planet inhabited by some weird looking creatures that can fly, resemble Pterodactyl with forked tails, and have hammerhead-shaped heads with a mouth full of steak knife teeth. These ravenous critters will munch you in a minute and they will even eat each other if the occasion arises. Our heroes are the ship's surviving pilot, Kyra (Radha Mitchell), a bounty hunter named Johns (Cole Hauser), Muslim Imam (Keith David), a little boy masquerading as a little girl named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), and convict Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) who is in restraints. They locate an alternate spaceship to get them off the planet. Other than being a convict, Riddick is a little different because he can see in the dark. One by one these characters are whittled down by the ugly monsters. Part of the problem is that we never get to clearly see what the lethal bird-like monsterys. Twohy stages with action with enough expertise and never lets up on the suspense. Vin Diesel is perfectly cast as an murderer with a gravel voice. There are enough surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat.",8,0,2,8 September 2013
Split," Predictable, But Entertaining, With Another O'Henry Ending
","If tour-de-force performances alone constituted great cinema, then 'Sixth Sense' writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's 'Split' would rate as one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie boils down to a straightforward, low-budget, abduction thriller, with a cannibalistic serial killer. The difference is this serial killer is a colorful basket case, a character teeming with more identities than you can count on all fingers and toes. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy of 'Victor Frankenstein') has forged a 'horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against the atrocity of real-life. Predictable, derivative, and sometimes preposterous, 'Split' benefits largely from McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual last-minute surprises. 'Split' feels like an 'origins' film. Not only is the protagonist a villain, but he also remains at large. The heroine is one of his hostages. Naturally, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged ding-a-ling abducts three pretty little things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, 'Split' features a wackadoodle serial killer who isn't presented as a maniac out of a Rob Zombie splatter film. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the wink of an eye is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is nothing short of brilliant as Kevin Wendell Crumb. Were it not for one of the three captives, 'Split' would have probably focused entirely on Kevin and not been as dramatic. Casey Cook is one of the kidnapped girls, but she is nothing like the other girls. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three fruitcakes that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or original. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing this psycho. What 'Split' does better than anything else is create a strong, memorable villain, and McAvoy fleshes it out in a bravura performance. Shyamalan conjures up a modicum of suspense toward the end when the girls try desperately to escape. Sometimes, this above-average suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters to survive.Like Kevin, Casey Cook (Anya Taylor-Joy of 'The Witch') has been forged in the crucible of child abuse, too. A heart attack killed her father (Sebastian Arcelus of 'Ted 2') while she was attending elementary school. Sadly, her father's brother, Uncle John (Brad William Henke of 'Fury'), became Casey's guardian. Without divulging too much information, Casey and her stepfather have had an abusive relationship. Now, in high school, Casey prefers to keep to herself. Two of her snobbish classmates, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of 'The Edge of Seventeen') and Claire's African-American friend Marcia (Jessica of 'Honeytrap'), invite her to their birthday party more out of pressure rather than friendship. Indeed, they harbor cynical attitudes about Casey, but they fear the social media repercussions about what they might have faced had they not invited Casey. When her ride doesn't materialize, Casey agrees to accompany Claire and Marcia and listen to Claire's father (Brian Gildea) who loves to tell terrible jokes. As the saying goes, Hell is a road paved with good intentions, and Claire and Marcia have provided the asphalt that puts Casey in harm's way. Before they can pull out of the parking lot, a total stranger, Kevin Wendell Crumb, dispenses with Claire's dad and then carjacks them. Slipping on a face mask, he sprays something in their eyes that plunges them into oblivion. Of course, had they not been paralyzed with fear, these girls could have fled before Kevin incapacitated them. When they awaken, the girls find themselves locked up in a room with the same tight-lipped stranger staring at them. Eventually, they discover something is seriously amiss with their captor. Every time Crumb appears, he masquerades as an entirely different individual, sometimes even as a woman. What the three girls don't realize is that Kevin is a patient of a world-renowned psychotherapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley of 'Frantic'), who has terribly misjudged the threat that he poses to society. Repeatedly, Kevin warns her about 'the beast' and how this Messianic personality will shield all twenty-three personalities from scorn and ridicule. When 'the beast' shows up, 'Split' turns into a warped Marvel Comics movie because this side of Kevin possesses supernatural characteristics.Basically, 'Split' is a standard-issue serial killer saga. Neither the police nor the FBI interfere in 'Split,' which differentiates it from movies like 'Manhunter.' Shyamalan confines the action primarily to several underground rooms and one in a luxurious apartment. Shyamalan fashions some mildly suspenseful scenes, especially when the girls try to break out in the end. When the time comes for him to depict death, Shyamalan doesn't indulge himself as Eli Roth of 'Hostel' infamy might. Nevertheless, the action amounts to a predictable series of episodic encounters between McAvoy's various personalities and his victims. Aside from Kevin Wendell Crumb, Casey qualifies as the only other genuinely interesting character. The two snobbish girls might as well have been mannequins. They are expendable, and they behave like whiny victims in a movie where whiny victims die. Most of Shyamalan's surprises occur exactly when you expect them, though two deserve back-to-back 'WOWS!' because they come both as a relief and surprise! The outcome of Casey's hostile clash with 'the Beast' salvages this otherwise predictable potboiler. Bruce Willis's cameo in the final scene as security guard David Dunn brings 'Split' into the 'Unbreakable' timeline. Moreover, two characters at a diner compare Crumb to Glass! Ultimately, Shyamalan wants moviegoers to see James McAvoy's conflicted serial killer in 'Split' in the same light as Alfred Hitchcock's classic chiller 'Psycho' with Anthony Perkins as the protagonist.",7,211,505,6 February 2017
Cold Mountain," Bold Mountain!!!
","'English Patient' director Anthony Minghella died before his time. Nevertheless, he made one of the more memorable movies about the American Civil War. Adapting Charles Frazier's first novel, writer & director Minghella depicted aspects of the War Between the States that no other film else has ever detailed. First, this epic length war film unfolds with the disastrous Battle of the Crater at Petersburg in 1864. Late in the war, Union troops tunneled beneath Confederate lines and detonated explosives that they had stockpiled in a mine. Indeed, this constituted a daring maneuver, but the Union didn't take into account the consequences of such a plan and they paid dearly for their audacity. Our sympathetic protagonist, Inman (Jude Law of 'Alfie'), is one of many Southern soldiers resting in a trench who got the surprise of their lives. Moments before the explosion, a rabbit tears through their trench and not long afterward the charges ignited and blew up the area. The spectacle of the explosion is truly incredible. Afterward, Union troops poured into the crater as they charged Southern lines, but the rebels trapped them in the crater. 'Cold Mountain' not only deals with the battlefront, but also it concerns the home front. After Inman and his friends enthusiastically march off to war, some of the most notorious citizens, led by Teague (Ray Winstone of 'Beowulf'), establish a Home Guard. The Home Guard has the right to enter anybody's home if they suspect the occupants are housing deserters, and they may even be able to confiscate the property. Teague and his evil henchman, including Boise (Charlie Hunnam of TV's 'Sons of Anarchy'), exploit these opportunities for their monetary gain, too.Aside from these two little seen events, Minghella assembled a strong stellar cast. As Ada Monroe, the refined daughter of the widowed Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland of 'M.A.S.H.'), Nicole Kidman is a young lady who has been raised like an aristocrat in Charleston, South Carolina, and has led an insular life. She doesn't know any practical to do, except play the piano. The Reverend Monroe left Charleston for reasons concerning his declining health. When they arrive in Cold Mountain, Ada meets Inman while his friends and he are erecting Reverend Monroe's church. Ada and Inman mingle now and then, but they never indulge themselves in hugs and kisses until the day that Inman must depart for war. After the opening Petersburg battle, Minghella shifts back and forth between Ada and Inman. Ada's father dies and she struggles to survive on a farm that she knows nothing about until her neighbors send her a laborer, Ruby (Renée Zellweger) who gets everything back in order for Ada and teaches her how to survive. Meantime, Inman leaves a hospital and deserts. He spends most of his time on foot avoiding groups of Home Front horsemen. Along the way, he encounters a hypocritical preacher, Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who has impregnated an African-American slave woman and plans to murder her. Inman thwarts the minister's plans and compels him to suffer the wrath of his congregation. Miraculously, Veasey escapes and stumbles across Inman later during his flight. 'Cold Mountain' qualifies as first-class from fade-in to fade-out, with a top-notch supporting cast, including Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Brendan Gleeson, Giovanni Ribisi, Katy Baker, and Lucas Black. No expense appears to have been overlooked by Minghella in this impressive $79-million production that was partially lensed on location in the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. If you consider yourself a Civil War fan, you should enjoy this movie.Interestingly enough, as an afterward of sorts to my comment about the Civil War and this film, historian Gary W. Gallagher cites Minghella from an interview about the director's sentiments about the Civil War and its relevance to 'Cold Mountain.' Minghella words can be found in Gallagher's book 'Causes Won, Lost, & Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know About The Civil War.' Says Minghella, 'This film is not a history lesson. It doesn't exist to stand in for a study of a real event. Rather, it tries to cast light on some circumstances which surround any war . . . . If I thought I was making a Civil War film, then I wouldn't have taken this project on.'",10,1,2,25 February 2015
Knowing," Makes the Book of Revelation Look Like A Weenie Roast!
","Australian director Alex Proyas is best known for minor science fiction gems like 'Dark City' and 'The Crow' but worse known for cretinous big-budget baloney like 'I, Robot.' Proyas' predictable new Nicolas Cage science-fiction horror chiller 'Knowing,' is a lukewarm end of days prophecy potboiler that is appropriately enough scripted by the numbers. Truly, Cage needs to make a good movie. The Oscar winning Best Actor for 'Leaving Las Vegas' hasn't made a memorable movie since the first 'National Treasure' back in 2005, and 'National Treasure' was no trove. Does anybody want to remember Cage's recent labors, 'Lord of War,' 'The Weather Man,' 'World Trade Center,' 'The Wicker Man,' 'Ghost Rider,' 'Next' (nor entirely egregious), 'National Treasure 2' and the wholly abominable 'Bangkok Dangerous?' Cage's bit part as Fu Manchu in the faux trailer 'Werewolf Women of the SS' in the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino retro-misfire 'Grindhouse' (2007) is about as good as it gets for the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola. Clearly, Cage either needs to hire a new agent or start looking before he leaps into some more half-baked hokum. 'Knowing' qualifies as a poor man's 'Close Encounters of a Third Kind' with a gloomy ending. Moreover, 'Knowing' looks like Proyas put shrink-wrap on the camera lens. He lensed it with a video camera and the murky imagery detracts from the atmosphere instead of evokes it. Furthermore, the special effects look rather ersatz, especially the jetliner that crashes near the traffic jam while our hero is standing in awe.In 1959, a Boston-area elementary school girl, Lucinda Embry (newcomer Lara Robinson), comes up with the bright idea of planting a time capsule with drawings in it that nobody will see for five decades. Little Lucinda is rather weird herself. She doesn't draw a picture. Instead, she scribbles down numbers ad nauseaum. Five decades elapse like yesterday and the school unearths the capsule and every student gets a drawing. One student, Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury of 'Powder Blue'), the son of MIT astrophysicist professor John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), is handed a page filled with nothing but numbers. Dear old egg-headed dad gets soused one night and eyeballs the numerals and discovers to his surprise that the number groupings are the days when disasters occurred or may occur. Suddenly, stealthy, white-haired guys in long dark coats start showing up and giving Caleb little black rocks. By the way, Caleb has a hearing problem and his hearing device acts up. One night, a 'whisper person' materializes in Caleb's upstairs bedroom and gives him a Dantesque vision of a forest ablaze with wildlife futilely trying to escape the conflagration. Meanwhile, we learn that John's wife died in a motel fire out west while he was blowing leaves off his front yard. Now, John believes that life constitutes little more than a meaningless series of random acts, until he scrutinizes those numbers and embarks on a crusade to save the country.This thinly-plotted science fiction hokum boasts zero suspense until John's younger sister Gracie (newcomer Natalie Townsend) sneaks up behind him while he is pondering the numbers and jostles his chair. This qualifies as the most frightening moment in this 122-minute movie. Meanwhile, John's skeptical MIT colleague, Phil Beckman (Ben Mendelsohn of 'The New World'), is worried about John's obsession with these figures. John explains to an incredulous Phil that the numbers correspond to the dates, sites and death tolls of every disaster in that period. Finally, Phil takes John seriously after our hero witnesses a jetliner crash when he is trapped in traffic gridlock. John realizes now that the extra numbers that he couldn't explain were GPS tracking statistics. Eventually, John tracks down Lucinda's daughter, Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne of Fox TV's 'Damages'), and they become friends. Diana takes John to a ramshackle house in the woods where her mother Lucinda spent her last days, and John uncovers a revelation under her bed that staggers his mind and turns Diana as pale as a cadaver. They realize that the coming events make the book of Revelation look like a weenie roast.Sadly, the special effects are substandard. The scene where the jetliner crashes looks as bogus as is the New York City subway accident where hundreds of people die when a train derails and collides with another train. The downtime between John's discoveries will have you yawning and looking at your watch. Cage does a good job of going berserk along with everybody else around him, but the story is downright preposterous. Moreover, from the gas prices posted at the service stations, 'Knowing' was made before the plunge in gas prices so the studio must have been shuffling this mishmash from one focus group to another to figure out an appropriate ending. Proyas doesn't generate the kind of ominous dread that the 'Final Destination' movies furnish and the finale is depressing. Call it Crappy Encounters of a Close Kind and save your money!",1,11,25,21 March 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Talk to the Hand!!!
","Audacious adrenaline-laced action sequences, a resolute refusal to take itself seriously, and a surprise finale help the new apocalyptic Arnold Schwarzenegger science fiction epic 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' overcome its flat, formulaic, road show plot with its loquacious pseudo-scientific gobbledygook. No, director Jonathan Mostow's 'T-3' doesn't top James Cameron's 1991 classic 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Although 'T-3' lacks the narrative depth and complexity of 'T-2,' this $170 million sequel based on Cameron's characters boasts more than enough muscle, mayhem, and momentum to make it worth watching though not altogether memorable. Mostow, who directed the W. W. II submarine saga 'U-571' and the Kurt Russell wife-napping nail-biter 'Breakdown,'calls the shots this time and acquits himself well enough, considering how shallow the John Brancato & Michael Ferris screenplay remains throughout its lean, mean 109 minute running time. Aside from brawny Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist, Earl Boen as Dr. Silverman qualifies as the only holdover from previous 'Terminator' movies. Warner Brothers dumped Edward Furlong, whose real-life drunken antics cost him the John Connor role, and the studio replaced him with brooding-looking Nick Stahl of 'Bully' and 'In The Bedroom.' Unfortunately, Stahl lacks any kind of charisma and he shares no chemistry with Claire Danes. For the record, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor has taken the long hike, too.The nuts and bolts John Brancato & Michael Ferris screenplay (their credits include 'The Game' and 'The Net') picks up the plot about 10 years after 'T-2.' Leukemia has claimed Sarah Connor's life, and her grown-up son John (Nick Stahl) struggles to blend into the background and lives life 'off the grid.' He suspects that the future still holds something sinister for him, and he's right. As in 'T-2,' 'T-3' opens with a new Terminator, this time a Terminatrix, the T-X (svelte-looking super model Kristanna Loken of 'Academy Boyz'), stalking not only him but also those slated to act as his future lieutenants. Clearly, Mostow and his scribes must have seen Lara Flynn Boyle's mutant bug villainess in 'Men In Black 2' and liked the idea. Like Robert Patrick's Terminator in 'T-2,' this Terminatrix sports a new generation of liquid-metal skin as well as a lethal limb that she can turn into a plasma cannon, stiletto probe and power saw. As villainess go, this bombshell robo-babe is truly bad to the bone! She can crank up parked cars from afar and send them careening off down the road as if they were remote control toys. And she is not out to take prisoners either! This Terminatrix gives new meaning to stereotype about reckless women drivers in an early chase scene when she hijacks a gigantic construction crane truck and demolishes half of Los Angeles trying to run down John Connor. One of those lieutenants on her hit list is mild-mannered veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes of 'Brokedown Palace'). It seems that Kate and John shared a romantic moment together back in their high school days. Actually, it was the day before John's foster parents were mysteriously murdered and he vanished without a trace. The coincidences get even better. Now, it also seems that Kate's papa is a three-star general in charge of Skynet, an ultra-sophisticated computerized defense system which eventually out-smarts mankind and sends machines out to kill, kill, kill. No sooner has the action in 'T-3' unfolded than things go on the Fritz. Least we not forget, in the middle of all this madness, another Terminator shows up in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger. No, not the same one who died at the end of 'T-2,' but he is just as obsolete as his earlier incarnation compared with the new Terminator. Nevertheless, Arnold makes life difficult for the Terminatrix. Kristanna Loken makes a terrific Terminatrix, too.'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine' ranks as one of the most physically exhausting movies you'll see. You'll feel bruised and battered, especially after the battle between the two cyborgs in the bathroom. When was the last time you saw somebody tear an entire urinal out of the wall and smash somebody over the head with it? One of my favorite scenes occurred in the police cruiser when the Terminatrix --masquerading as Scott Mason—shoves her fist through the detective's chest and drives the car. Sadly, 'T-3' doesn't provide Arnold with near enough clever one-liners as he had as either 'Terminator' (1984) or 'T-2,' but 'T-3' still packs a hugely entertaining punch. Arnold's favorite like is 'Talk to the hand.' Mostow stages a memorable entrance for Arnold. He saunters into a bar during ladies night without a stitch on and insists that the male stripper give him all his clothes. The firefight at Greenlawn Cementery is interesting, too. When Arnold emerges from the crypt carrying the casket like a stick on his shoulder, the image reminded me of the Spaghetti western hero named Django who drags a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Incidentally, Arnold is toting not only firearms but also John Connor. The worst thing you can say about 'T-3' is that it is a high-octane, swiftly-paced, straightforward melodrama with little of its predecessor's wit and wisdom. On the other hand, if you relish break-neck action movies with a high quota of slam-bang auto crashes, trigger-happy shoot-outs, and an over-the-top, face-to-face confrontation between two larger-than-life cyborgs titans, you should catch 'T-3' on the big-screen!",8,2,3,6 February 2008
U-571," Between A Depth Charge and A Deep Place
","People that suffer from claustrophobia may crack under the pressure of watching the Matthew McConaughey movie 'U-571' that emphasizes plot over character. Writer & director Jonathan ('Breakdown') Mostow's white-knuckled World War II suspense yarn concerns a gallant group of U.S. Navy submariners that capture a Nazi U-boat and confiscate its ultra-secret Enigma decoding device. Predictably, this secret mission saga charts a hackneyed but hair-raising course with each cliffhanger situation dwarfing its predecessor until the action concludes with a slam-bang! Combine elements of director Dick Powell's 'The Enemy Below' (1957) and Wolfgang Peterson's classic 'Das Boot!' (1981) and you've got a fair idea what Mostow and co-scribes Sam Montgomery and David Ayer set their sights on with this rugged, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred nail-biter. Despite a raft of technical flaws (ranging from errors in naval rank to submarine technology and ultimately history itself), 'U-571' excels as an above-average, adrenalin-drenched adventure about deep sea heroics. Seldom does a war movie rack your nerves, race your pulse, and make you squirm with such consummate skill as this seaworthy epic.'U-571' imitates but never surpasses 'Das Boot.' This aquatic chronicle opens in the North Atlantic as a U-boat sinks an Allied supply ship. An Allied destroyer spots the Nazi sub and seeds the ocean with depth charges. The Germans escape by the skin of their teeth, but their engines conk out on them and all their mechanics are dead, leaving them stranded at sea. When the Americans learn about the disable sub, they launch a last minute mission to storm the ship and steal its Enigma decoder. The Enigma was a sophisticated super-typewriter that the German High Command used to communicate with its subs. If the Americans can steal an Enigma, they can cripple Hitler's wolf pack strategy which has enabled the Nazis to dominate the seas. Not only must they heist the decoder, but they also must either liquidate or take the entire crew hostage, so the Nazis will never suspect their decoder has fallen into enemy hands; otherwise, the Germans would change their codes. Accomplishing that ambitions feat turns out easier said than done.The U.S. Navy disguises the S-33, one of its vintage World War I submarines, as a U-boat. They hope the Germans will mistake it as one of their own when the rendezvous at sea occurs. Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren ('Twister's' Bill Paxton) skippers this leaky but reliable sardine can, while Matthew ('Contact') McConaughey serves as executive officer Lt. Andrew Tyler. Tyler champs at the bit for his own command, but Dahlgren has torpedoed his ambitions. The skipper doesn't think Tyler has the guts to order men to sacrifice their lives for their country. Meanwhile, as the architects of this daring 'Trojan horse' night-time raid, German-speaking Lt. Hirsch (Jake 'Meet Joe Black' Webber) and jaw-jutting Marine Major Coonan (David 'An Officer & A Gentleman' Keith) come aboard before they cast off. Coonan plans to train the S-33 crew as his raiding party.'U-571' does best what only upper echelon war movies can. Neither its heroes nor its audiences get a break. Overwhelming obstacles and even worse odds confound them at every turn. Surprises energize the lean, mean plot, and events wax from bad to worse. The super-charged action never lags under Mostow's taut direction. Pacing is paramount here, and Mostow deep-sizes anything that doesn't enhance the headlong momentum. As the story unfolds, Mostow takes the heroes from the wild open spaces then bottles them and the viewer in the coffin-like confines of a U-boat. The harrowing depth charging sequence that punctuates the final reel will make you clench your teeth and know your fist. Deliberately, Mostow pares characterization to the bone. Of course, the usual stereotypes abound, but a persuasive cast breathes enough lift into them to make them interesting. The hero that wanted to captain a sub doesn't exactly get what he wants, but when he finds himself in command, he manages to make the best of a terrible situation.Matthew McConaughey of 'Dazed & Confused' and Harvey Keitel of 'Bad Lieutenant' take top acting honors. McConaughey shows more psychological depth and poise here as an angry young sub commander than he has in all his earlier films put together. As Lt. Andrew Tyler, he goes from being an officer scorned to an austere-minded commander. He learns the meaning of being second-in-command, of making decisions based on imperfect information that may prompt combat casualties. (Rent 'The Guns of Navarone' if you don't get it.) Moreover, McConaughey's physical appearance compliments his performance. Hollywood actors all too often ignore the military rules about haircuts and wear their locks at lengths that no officer would dare. McConaughey has his hair shorn to the scalp. The variety of facial expressions he wears manifests the utter desperation that he feels as a green American submarine commander trapped inside a Nazi sub with nothing but his own wits to keep his crew and himself between a depth charge and a deep place. Meanwhile, cast against the grain in a genre new to him, seasoned actor Harvey Keitel provides solid support as the chief of the boat. He helps Lt. Tyler complete his transition from everybody's friend to a feared and respected Naval skipper.History buffs and navy specialists may not enjoy 'U-571' as thoroughly as less demanding moviegoers. Keep in mind, this is Hollywood, not history. This frantic but formulaic actioneer deploys all the standard war movie clichés, but Mostow stages everything with such style and verve that he swamps the flaws. Despite all its blood and gore, a clearly inspirational message underscores 'U-571.' Every character in this weather-beaten yarn 'does their job' and never quits. Similarly, 'U-571' does its job by never letting you off the hook until its thrilling conclusion.",8,1,5,7 April 2008
"I, Robot"," First Rule of Robotics: Don't Kick Isaac In His Asimov
","Rule # 1: Hollywood shouldn't make some books into movies.Take, for example, science fiction author Isaac Asimov's 'I, Robot,' a classic collection of cautionary short stories about the unforeseen complications in a robot's logic as it tries to obey the three laws of robotics. Even when the robots appeared insane, Asimov was careful to show that by the lights of the robot's 'positronic brains,' they are behaving logically.Rule # 2: Movies with multiple stories don't make millions.Too many characters. Too many ideas. Too much originality. Too much segmentation. Consequently, when Hollywood lays its hands on literary legends like Asimov, they dumb down his work and turn it into a sprawling saga, with brash, loud-mouthed characters that audiences can laugh with so they can forget about the summer heat.In the Will Smith movie 'I, Robot,' Australian director Alex Proyas of 'The Crow,' Oscar-winning scenarist Akiva Goldsman of 'A Beautiful Mind,' and 'Final Fantasy' scribe Jeff Vintar have retained the three laws of robotics, but have turned an otherwise literary classic into a shallow, uninspired, paint-by-the-numbers, potboiler about an heroic, wise-cracking Chicago cop in the year 2035 who abhors robots. 'I, Robot' opens with the three laws of robots.1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.An alarm clock awakens divorced homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith of 'Ali') to another wonderful day. After a shower scene designed to display Smith's buff body, especially his curiously scarred 'Rambo' pectorals, our swaggering stereotypical lone wolf hero dons his ghetto black street clothes, unpacks a vintage pair of 2004 Converse All-Star sneakers, and cruises off to his first crime scene of the day in his tricked out Audi.The headquarters of the U.S. Robotics Corporation--a Microsoft-type company—stands in downtown Chicago. U.S. Robotics plans to put a robot in every home. Apparently, U.S.R.'s chief robot designer, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of 'Babe'), committed suicide. The visionary scientist hurled himself through his office window and fell hundreds of feet to the lobby. Spooner learns that Lanning had requested him specifically, so Del could listen to a message Lanning recorded for him on a preprogrammed hologram. Initially, Lanning's cryptic remarks make no sense to Del. When he visits Lanning's office, he discovers that the good doctor couldn't have jumped through the window. Del tries to break the window next to the window that Lanning shattered and barely makes a dent when he smashes a chair against it. No sooner does Del realize that the killer may still be in the room than the killer surprises him and escapes.Eventually, Del captures the robot and interrogates him. Before he can get far, U.S. Robotics' CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, who played JFK in 'Thirteen Days') storms into the police station. He demands the return of his property. Robertson reminds Del that the authorities cannot charge robots with murder. Not only have robots never posed a threat to humans, but also only humans can be charged with homicide. Inevitably, Del's world-weary boss, Lieutenant John Bergin (Chi McBride of 'Gone In 60 Seconds'), chews him out for crying 'robot' every time something happens to him. Del remains far from convinced, however, about the innocence of robots. He bears a grudge against them. During an accident, a truck rammed both his vehicle and another car with a 12-year old girl inside. Both cars sank into a river. A passing robot witnessed the accident and dived in to rescue Del. Our protagonist told the robot to save the little girl instead, so he feels guilty about her death and despises robots.Gee, doesn't this sound familiar? Like a movie from the 1980s? A rebellious but maimed cop battling a corporation with a dark secret. Hey, didn't Tom Selleck do something like that in the 1984 epic 'Runaway?' Or what about 1982's 'Blade Runner?' Or 'Westworld,' where the robots cannot kill humans either. Del spends the rest of 'I, Robot's' predictable 115 minutes trying to prove to everybody that robots are dangerous. He worries especially because his mother (Adrian Ricard of 'Bulworth') has won a robot in lottery. Meanwhile, despite all this horrible publicity, Robertson plans to market a new line of robots, and he wants Del off his back permanently. Of course, hard-headed as Del is, he doesn't take no for an answer, even when Bergin takes his badge and suspends him from the force.Basically, aside from a fairly low-key performance, Will Smith's futuristic detective doesn't appear too far removed from his wealthy playboy cop in the 'Bad Boys' movies. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a sidekick like Martin Lawrence to take up the slack in this occasionally exciting but largely superficial sci-fi saga. Not even his quips seem catchy. Smith spouts lines like: 'Does believing you're the last sane man on the planet make you crazy? 'Cause if that's the case, maybe I am. ' Probably his best line, and that isn't saying much, is: 'Somehow 'I told you so' just doesn't quite say it.' 'I, Robot' looks okay, if you don't think about some of the gaping plot holes. Wait until you see what Del's secret weapon is. Talk about a cop-out! The robots are marginally intimidating, but two action sequences, a careening chase scene in a freeway tunnel and a demolition robot that destroys a mansion look cool. Despite its plea for tolerance, which was handled better in 'Bicentennial Man,' 'I, Robot' breaks no new ground in the robots on the prowl genre.",6,23,40,22 January 2007
Wanted," An Incredible, Exciting, But Totally Unrealistic Pulp Thriller
","Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, with two landmark horror movies 'Night Watch' and its 2006 sequel 'Day Watch' under his belt, makes his theatrical English-language film debut with the jolting new Angelina Jolie epic 'Wanted,' an imaginative, audacious, but improbable hyperkinetic actioneer with Morgan Freeman and James McAvoy. Ostensibly, scenarists Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, who wrote the '3:10 to Yuma' remake and 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift' scribe Chris Morgan have adapted Mark Millar and J.G. Jones' Dark Horse graphic novel. Bekmambetov and his writers, however, have appropriated only the set-up from the graphic novel and replaced the graphic novel plot about a fraternity of super villains with a plot about a fraternity about elite assassins that safeguard the balance between good and evil in society. Audiences that have seen either 'Night Watch' or 'Day Watch' will have no problem enjoying this high-octane, adrenaline-laced thriller. Meanwhile, people who prefer that their movies to conform to the laws of gravity will dismiss 'Wanted' as preposterously unrealistic to the point a Coyote & Road Runner cartoon.Essentially, 'Wanted' takes its cues for its protagonist from 'Fight Club' and 'The Matrix.' Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy of 'Atonement') toils as a cubicle worker in a dead-end job with an obese female boss, Janice (Lorna Scott of 'Smokin' Aces'), who constantly berates him without mercy for his inferior job performance between the bites that she takes out of a jelly-filled doughnut. When she is in a good mood, Janice drives Wesley crazy with a stapler that she wields like a baton. Wesley suffers from panic attacks, and Janice's rosy disposition triggers these attacks. If Janice isn't the source of his woes, Wesley has to contend with his blond, drop-dead gorgeous, live-in girlfriend, Kathy (Kristen Hager of 'AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem') who is cheating on him with his best friend, Barry (Chris Pratt of 'Strangers with Candy'), while Wesley is at work.One day, Wesley's life changes when he stops by the local pharmacy to refill his meds. One minute he is standing there alone and the next minute, he finds a woman named Fox (an anorexic Angelina Jolie of 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' with too much eye-liner) telling him that he apologizes too much. Not long after Wesley meets Fox, a gunfight erupts in the drug store as Cross (Thomas Kretschmann of 'Blade 2') starts blasting away at Wesley and Fox. Our hero and heroine make a hair-raising escape. They become separated as they scramble out of the pharmacy and Wesley finds himself about to get run down by Cross in a step-van when Fox executes a 360 spin'the bootlegger's spinand sweeps him into her car. After an implausible but exciting car with Cross and Fox shooting it out in night-time urban traffic, our hero and heroine pull off a gravity-defying stunt that only Evel Knievel could have dreamed up.Fox takes Wesley to her hideout where an organization called 'The Fraternity' operates a textile factory. She introduces him to Sloane (an immaculately dressed Morgan Freeman of 'Unforgiven' with a thumb ring) and Sloane reveals to a shocked Wesley that his father was the best hit-man in the Fraternity until another loose cannon killer, Cross, blew his brains out. Wesley is shocked first because his father abandoned him not long after his mother gave birth to him and two that Sloane has just transferred a million dollar balance into his bank account that once belonged to his dad. Sloane and Fox want to train Wesley to replace not only his father but also to exact revenge and kill the evil Cross.Again, nothing about 'Wanted' is remotely believable. Some movies contain the illusion of credibility, but 'Wanted' throws all restraint to the wind and Bekmambetov orchestrates one ridiculous stunt after another until the movie runs out of suspense and thrives simply on white-knuckled thrills and computer-generated stunts. The acting is solid enough with McAvoy turning in a charismatic performance as a loser who becomes a hero. Angelina Jolie surpasses anything that she did in her two 'Tomb Raider' movies and 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith.' Things get really outlandish for her when she sprawls out on the hood of a car careening through traffic so that she can get a clear shot at Cross in the step-van pursuing them. Morgan Freeman does what he does better than anybody else. He explains half of the plot. According to him, the Fraternity is an age-old organization of weavers that take their orders from the Loom of Fate. They scrutinize the way that the loom weaves threads and decipher who must die for the preservation of society.Like most summer movies, the best way to enjoy 'Wanted' is to forget the way that it fragrantly and repeatedly violates the laws of gravity. Wesley, our hero, has a knack for literally slinging bullets around objects to hit his intended victim. In short, he slings his gun arm as if he were hurling a bowling ball through the air, and he can hit a target that is hidden from his eyes. The computer-generated graphics of the villain's baroque-looking bullet that separates in phases like a booster powered missile and perforates a man's forehead looks truly awesome. 'Wanted' has one of those last-minute reversals that will catch you totally off guard and blow your mind. Perhaps the closest thing to 'Wanted' is a 1969 melodrama called 'The Assassination Bureau' with Diana Rigg and Oliver Reed.",6,1,4,9 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The Best Terminator Movie!!!
","Sequels rarely surpass originals, but 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' provides the exception to the rule. Writer & director James Cameron has outdone himself with this follow-up film to his seminal sci-fi, time travel, yarn about men and machines. In the original, a Cybernetic organism classified a Terminator appeared from the future to execute Sarah Connor, while the mankind resistance army of the future dispatched a warrior back to 1984 to save Sarah from certain death. Kyle Reese showed up and helped Sarah kill the Terminator. Nevertheless, although our heroine managed to survive the nightmarish ordeal and have a baby before she hightailed it to Mexico, Cyberdyne Systems acquired the forearm of the Terminator that she killed in the machine press and Sarah eventually wound up locked away in custody at the Pescadero Mental Hospital. Miraculously, Sarah's ten-year son John Connor (Edward Furlong in his first role) has been farmed out to foster parents, Janelle (Jenette Goldstein) and Tod Voight (Xander Berkeley), but is living the life of a low-grade hoodlum ripping off automated teller devices at banks when another Terminator designated a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) shows up to kill him. Unlike the enemy Terminator in 'The Terminator,' the T-1000 is a highly advanced model that consists of liquid metal and can alter its shape. Essentially, the T-1000 is far more formidable than the earlier Terminators, and it gives our heroes a run for their money. As it turns out, the Resistance has rewired a T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger of 'Red Sonja') and sent him back to 1995 to protect John. The outcome is a thoroughly exciting action thriller that raises the stakes where the villainous Terminators are concerned. Cameron and co-writer William Wisher have supplemented the plot with some humor as young John Connor helps the Terminator fit into society by saying familiar phrases. The T-1000 is a truly menacing adversary for our heroes and they have to keep on blasting away at it because it can repair itself in no time. As Sarah Connor, Linda Hamilton has undergone a transformation from being a vulnerable waitress to being a lean, mean doll who fights the Terminator. Initially, when John and the T-101 show up at the mental asylum, they have to battle the T-1000 and escape by the hair of their chin. You won't find a better sci-fi actioneer than 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' and some of the dialogue is funny.",10,1,1,11 July 2015
Salt," Loaded With Sodium!!!
","Angelina Jolie puts on her bad-girl, butt-kicking britches in 'Patriot Games' director Phillip Noyce's espionage melodrama 'Salt' and shows what one elite lady can do against greater numbers and outlandish odds. This electrifying, surprise-laden thriller resembles director Don Siegel's Cold War era actioneer 'Telefon' (1977) where KGB agent Charles Bronson dealt with a similar threat from Communist sleeper cell agents awakened by a renegade Russian ready to ignite a nuclear war. The chief difference in 'Salt' is that our attractive protagonist is one of the sleeper cell agents! Clocking in at a breathless 100 minutes, this edge-of-the-seat spy movie never exhausts its get-up-and-go. Our nimble, quick-witted, super-sexy heroine smashes anybody who defies her. In fact, nothing man-made can halt her. She is as much an inexorable force here as the male hit-man was in the Coen Brothers' epic 'No Country for Old Men.' No matter what either the C.I.A. or the N.Y.P.D. try to do to thwart her, Salt keeps on kicking. No situation is so foolproof that she cannot out-fox the opposition. Unfortunately, Noyce and 'Ultraviolet' scenarist Kurt Wimmer sacrifice credibility as well as characterization along the way to maintain their high velocity. Eventually, at some point, you'd think somebody would throw caution to the wind and simply put some lead through Salt's head. Of course, this cannot happen because the movie would grind to an abrupt end. Watching 'Salt' is the equivalent of reading a page-turning best-seller that you cannot put down. Moreover, 'Salt' is the kind of thriller that requires your constant attention. Leave your seat for either the concession stand or the restroom and you will find yourself baffled when you return. Believe it or not, Tom Cruise turned down this thriller to make 'Knight and Day.' 'Salt' opens like the James Bond thriller 'Die Another Day.' C.I.A. agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie of 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith') has fallen into the hands of the North Koreans, and they interrogate and torture her for information that she refuses to divulge under any kind of pressure. The evil North Koreans cry uncle and exchange Salt for one of their agents that the Americans have. Salt learns from her superior, C.I.A. agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'), that her German arachnologist husband, Mike Krause (August Diehl of 'Inglourious Basterds'), exerted maximum pressure to effect a prisoner exchange. No sooner has our considerably relieved heroine flown back to Washington than another crisis occurs. As she is about to leave the building, an older Russian walks into the agency and gives himself up. Before the C.I.A. does anything else, they decide to grille him. Since Salt is fluent in Russian, she handles the interrogation while Winter and fellow C.I.A. agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor of '2012') watch her through a one-way window. Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski of 'Tin Drum') explains that a sleeper cell of highly trained agents is going to murder Russian President Matveyev (Olek Krupa of 'The Italian Job') when he attends the funeral of the Vice President in New York City. Moreover, Orlov elaborates that these agents were indoctrinated from childhood and boast skills that make them unstoppable. Worse, he puts the finger on Evelyn.Naturally, Salt denies Orlov's allegations, and Winter throws up his hands in disgust when Peabody puts too much stock in Orlov's story. Salt's case is not helped when a C.I.A. technician observes that Orlov breezed through the lie detector test without a glitch. Winter is prepared to overlook these outrageous allegations, but Peabody shows greater reluctance. When Peabody tries to arrest her, Salt slips through his hands and eludes every security guard and lockdown procedure in the building. Salt plunges into D.C. traffic and moves by leaps and bounds from one truck to the next with the C.I.A. smoking tires at her heels. This is one of those thrillers where nothing is impossible for the heroine. She can cling to a high-balling, 18-wheeler in rush hour traffic with one hand and can dive from one vehicle on a higher level of a clover leaf overpass to another vehicle beneath without a care in the world. Coincidence is her best ally. Salt can do no wrong.This abbreviated synopsis will have to suffice for the time being. Revealing the surprises that ensue would sabotage the suspense and tension that Noyce and Wimmer generate with this PG-13 adventure. There are moments when Salt imitates the TV troubleshooter MacGyver and constructs a weapon with items lying around that are not practical weapons. The problem with all of this is that any alert audience member will spot the holes that Noyce and Wimmer do a fairly decent job of concealing. Several inexplicable moments occur that bother Peabody while Winter never stops defending Salt against the accusations, no matter how far out on a limb our heroine dances. 'Salt' isn't a performance-oriented spectacle. Too many things happen and the revelations that keep pace with these changes are designed to make you think one way while the filmmakers are setting up their next surprise. At another point, only when the villain decides to launch a nuclear warhead against the Arabs does 'Salt' look like a post-Cold War thriller. While Noyce's movie surpasses Jolie's two 'Tomb Raider' flicks, 'Salt' isn't as interesting as either 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' or the equally audacious 'Wanted.'",Null,3,7,25 July 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Flawlessly Funny Farce About Music Bio-Pics With Terrific Songs!
","You'll laugh so much watching 'Orange County' director Jake Kasdan's comedy 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' that you might have to change your drawers. Kasdan penned this impudent, politically incorrect spoof with 'Knocked-Up' & 'Superbad' scribe Judd Apatow that mercilessly lampoons last year's poignant Joaquin Phoenix & Reese Witherspoon biography 'Walk the Line' of superstar pop singer Johnny Cash. Unlike so many recent spoofs, such as 'Date Movie' and 'Epic Movie,' 'Walk Hard' contents itself strictly with shredding one movie rather than an entire year's worth. Surprisingly, however, Kasdan and Apatow not only manage to make the resemblance clear between 'Walk Hard' and 'Walk the Line' unmistakable, but also these two fertile minds drag in other superstar singers both dead and alive for added texture. The sheer brilliance of 'Walk Hard' is how perfectly Kasdan and Apatow ridicule the conventions of the famous singer musical biography. Again, unlike second-rate spoofs that the wring only the most superficial jokes out of the hero's predicament, this parody goes deeper with its devotion to detail. 'Walk Hard' takes us on a nostalgic journey through the rebellious 1950s to the psych-out 1960s, skewering musical genres like soul music, bubble-gun music, rock music, punk music, surfing music, and social protest music. The film charts its passage of time with repeated encounters between the hero and his band's drummer in a toilet abusing illicit narcotics with warm, willing, and wanton women. Moreover, Kasdan and Apatow transcend their satiric origins and forge characters that genuinely interest us for their own foibles rather than the synthesis of stereotypes that we've come to recognize over the years. For example, protagonist Dewey Cox brings to mind a number of famous singers, among them Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Ray Charles, and Bob Dylan.'Walk Hard' provides songs that mimic those Cash, Orbison, and Dylan classics, and the performers here deliver reasonably convincing renditions. Indeed, some of the humor, particularly the inclusion of lower frontal male nudity, may offend some unsuspecting moviegoers. Kasdan doesn't try to sneak a shot of male genitals past when you might not be looking. He displays male genitalia twice and draws attention to it without fear. Few mainstream American film releases have been this daring in this respect. Typically, only European imports have these largely taboo shots.Talented John C. Reilly of 'Boogie Nights' does a superb job as curly-headed Dewey Cox, the youngest son of a rural Springberry, Alabama, farmer with one older son and a younger daughter, who attains fame and fortune. 'Blades of Glory' actress Jenna Fischer as Darlene plays the equivalent of Reese Witherspoon's June Carter Cash and she is delightful. Darlene and Dewey sing a hilarious duet on stage filled with double-entrendes entitled 'Let's Duet.' Like 'Walk the Line,' 'Walk Hard' opens at a modern-day concert tribute to the hero and the stage manager is rushing breathlessly around trying to find Dewey Cox. Eventually, he discovers him in a dark hallway, his guitar slung over his back, his head bowed deep-in-thought as he ponders his past, leaning forward on one arm braced against the wall. Dewey's drummer Sam (Tim Meadows of ' ') informs the stage manager: 'Dewey Cox must rethink his entire life before he plays.' Kasdan and Apatow tell their story predominantly in flashback. We learn that Dewey had an older brother, Nate ( as a child and as a grown-up dead man) who was a musical progeny as well as the apple of his doting father's eye. Nate lives a charmed life, risking life and limb more often than not with fires, runaway horses, until he meets his untimely death during a duel in the barn with Dewey. They are fencing with a pair of machetes and Dewey loses the sheath for his machete and accidentally cuts his older brother into two pieces. The adolescent actor appears to be buried from the waist down in hay so that he can be alongside his trunk-less pelvis and legs. Dewey's father never lets his surviving son live down this accident. Repeatedly, through the action, the father appears and reminds Dewey that the wrong son died. Repeatedly, the ghost of dead Nate appears to Dewey (rather like the ghosts in 'Stardust') and lecture the hero. At one point, Dewey meets the Beatles during their sojourn in India. Dewey rubs shoulders with the Beatles and the filmmakers show that they know a thing or two about these immortal icons. Paul Rudd plays John; Jack Black does an amusing turn as Paul; Jason Schwartzman is appropriately goofy as Ringo and Justin Long scores as George Harrison and they introduce Dewey to LSD.Kasdan and Apatow hit more often than miss with their jokes in this consistently funny as well as moving musical biography parody. The songs are incredibly flavorful and funny, too. Margo Martindale excels as Dewey's homily, obese mom, while Raymond J. Barry steals the show as his strident father. 'Walk Hard' is strides beyond most cinematic satires.",10,3,6,7 January 2008
Duck Soup," The Zenith of Marxian Hilarity!
","Although the fifth Marx Brothers movie did not surpass the ticket sales of 'Horse Feathers' when Paramount first released it, 'Awful Truth' director Leo McCarey's 'Duck Soup' ranks now as the Marx Brothers' best all-time comedy. Indeed, this satirical masterpiece about war proved to be a turning point in the career of the brothers. After 'Duck Soup' performed poorly at the box office, Paramount declined to renew its contract with the zany quartet. Straight guy Marx brother Zeppo bailed out of the act to become a talent agent, while the remaining trio—Groucho, Chico, and Harpo--found a new home at Metro-Goldwyn Mayer—with wunderkind producer Irving Thalberg supervising their antics. Basically, Thalberg took the sting out of their chaotic comedy by turning them into comic relief for a young romantic couple in dire romantic straits. Previously, the Brothers had dominated the narratives. Now, they became hosts to less luminaries, and their humor lost its tangy flavor. According to Thalberg, the Marx Brothers not only lacked sympathy but they also alienated female audiences. You won't see Harpo thrusting his thigh into a girl's hands like he did in their Paramount releases. Mind you, the next two Marx Brothers' films--'A Night at the Opera' and 'A Day at the Races' are very funny, but neither film is the madcap hilarity of the Paramount Marx Brothers' escapades.Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby wrote both the hilarious screenplay and the songs. Some of the verbal jousting is classic. At one point during a cabinet meeting, Rufus says that only a four-year old could make sense of some gibberish and then he urges somebody to find him a four-year old. The plot in a nutshell involves the affluent Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) who refuses to lend any more of her millions to the postage-stamp sized bankrupt country of Freedonia unless they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) as their leader. Groucho is late to his own coronation when Mrs. Teasdale spots him in the ranks. Naturally, Rufus gives Mrs. Teasdale a sarcastic dressing down with puns galore. Meanwhile, the rival European country of Sylvania and its scheming ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern of 'The Magnificent Yankee') want to take over the country. Trentino sends in two spies Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx) to dig up incriminating information about Firefly that will sour Mrs. Teasdale on him. The gags are some of the best, particularly the oft-imitated mirror pantomime routine where Groucho and Harpo in sleeping gowns confront each other in an archway and try to fool the other into believing that they are cavorting in front of a mirror. The first scene when Chicolini and Pinky meet Trentino in his office is a laugh riot of puns, one-liners, and sight gags. If you consider yourself a Marx Brothers' fan, you must see this imaginative 68-minute classic. Any seasoned Marx Brothers devotee will spot the absence here of Harpo playing his namesake and Chico on the piano.",10,1,3,17 May 2011
We're the Millers," Talk About A Potboiler!!!
","'We're the Millers' gives new meaning to potboiler. This uneven but entertaining comedy of errors about a wise-cracking, small-time pot dealer who smuggles two metric tons of weed in a recreational vehicle has its share of moments. This is one of those drug movies where the narcotics constitute little more than packing material. Nobody is either shown inhaling marijuana or experiencing a buzz. The producers could have substituted another illegal drug here just to underline the generic quality of the story. It is difficult to imagine how 'Wedding Crashers' writers Bob Fisher and Steve Faber could have taken this imaginative premise and blown it. Not only did they concoct the idea but also the screenplay. Who knows how much 'Sex Drive' scribe Sean Anders or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' writer John Morris altered the premise? Like as not, Anders and Morris probably retooled the narrative. Nevertheless, this criminal comedy is not for people who prefer clean, conventional comedy. While the dialogue is riddled profanity, the subject matter is almost as objectionable. For example, another RV couple want to indulge in group sex to enliven their sex life. The funniest joke qualifies also as the most gross. Will Poulter is bitten on the testicle by a big hairy spider, and his testicle inflates like a balloon. Naturally, 'Dodge Ball: A True Underdog Story' director Rawson Marshall Thurber gives us a fleeting glimpse of this abnormality. You'll have to pause your Blu-ray or DVD to get a good glance at it. Admittedly, this comedy could have been worse. Stereotypes abound for comic purposes since this is broadly told comedy. The big-time drug dealers are depicted as despicable, and Ed Helms emerges as the slime of the slime. The cartel drug kingpin likes to shoot first and worry about the consequences afterward. The DEA Agent is depicted as flawed but human. The whole idea of a fake family and the evolution of their kinship is remotely appealing. None of them want to be a part of the family. Circumstances beyond their control compel them to take part in the crime. The eternally youthful Jennifer Aniston appears to be more intent on proving that she hasn't grown old and flabby with her tame stripper routine. Alas, she doesn't strip down to her bare buns. The whole enterprise is hopelessly conventional even when it struggles to be crude.Our hapless hero, David (Jason Sudeikis of 'Horrible Bosses'), rushes to the rescue of a homeless girl, Casey (Emma Roberts of 'Nancy Drew'), when three knife-wielding thugs try to pinch her iPhone. David intervenes in the fracas after naive Kenny Rossmore (Will Poulter of 'Son of Rambow') proves how ineffectual that he is. The street hoodlums take all of David's narcotics and his money. When David's drug boss Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms of 'The Hangover') finally catches up with the elusive David, he cuts him a deal to compensate for his considerable losses. Reluctantly, David agrees to pick up a massive load of marijuana in Mexico. During a conversation on the street after his meeting with Brad, David discovers the perfect gimmick to ensure that he is not busted. He assembles a pseudo-family because the authorities turn a blind eye to a family in an RV. One of the David's customers, who owes him money, is shacking up in the same apartment complex with a stripper, Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston) who has to quit her job. The man who runs the strip joint changes his mind and makes his girls perform fellatio on his customers. Sickened and degraded by this new rule, Rose walks off the job. Reluctantly, she joins David. Along the way, our heroes run afoul of other ruthless drug dealers. The treacherous Brad has told David to introduce himself as the man who serves Pablo Chacon. After David rolls off the premises with more dope that he could ever imagine, we learn that Brad lied when he told David to use Pablo's name. Veteran character actor Luis Guzman has a minor role as a corrupt Mexican cop who is gay.Look out for the language if profanity is a concern. 'We're The Millers' appears to have gotten its R-rating for its language and the use of the F-bomb.",6,0,1,9 June 2014
Disturbia," Worthwhile Suspenseful Saga
","Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios have done a skillful job of updating the classic 1954 Alfred Hitchcock thriller 'Rear Window' as a white-knuckled exercise in paranoia about three teenagers in jeopardy pitted against an intelligent but ruthless serial killer. Although this tense but entertaining new thriller with Shia LaBeouf, David Morse, and Carrie-Anne Moss does not cite the Hitchcock movie as its inspiration, anybody who has seen 'Rear Window' will know from watching the previews for 'Disturbia' (*** out of ****) that it recycles the predicament in the 1954 original with style and savvy. Basically, 'Rear Window' dealt with an injured photographer confined to a wheel chair. The photographer, played by James Stewart, had nothing better to do during his recovery than stare out of his apartment window at his neighbors. Eventually, the shutterbug hero suspects that one of the tenants has killed a woman and carved her body up into little pieces. While 'Two for the Money' director D.J. Caruso and scenarists Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have created a wholly different set of circumstances, 'Disturbia' is essentially still 'Rear Window,' but with teenagers and the 21st century surveillance technology at their disposal that the original lacked. 'Disturbia' opens serenely enough outdoors with Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf of 'Constantine') and his father Daniel (Matt Craven of 'Jacob's Ladder') up to their knees in a stream fishing for their dinner. Daniel uses this opportunity to bond with his son, but Kale is too embarrassed to confide in his father. Kale and Daniel are heading back home on the highway when they encounter a reckless driver careening across the road. Daniel dies in a horrendous accident, and Kale never really recovers from the traumatic ordeal. About a year later, Kale's Spanish teacher gives him a hard time in class, and our irate protagonist decks him with a right cross. A sympathetic judge sentences Kale to three months of house arrest. The authorities explain that the monitoring devise strapped to Kale's ankle will trigger its alarm if the youth strays beyond the confines of his parents' house. Initially, Kale has a difficult time adjusting to his captivity. Two kids across the street leave a flaming bag of fecal matter on Kale's front porch, and our hero stomps out the fire and then pursues the culprits. In the process, the alarm on his ankle monitor goes off and the cops arrest him. This occurs while Kale's new neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer of 'The Grudge 2'), is watching. Later, Kale and she become friends after she catches him spying on her with binoculars as she swims in her parents' pool in a bikini. After he learns about a serial killer in Los Angeles, Kale begins to notice that one of his neighbors, Mr. Turner (David Morse of 'The Rock'), behaves in a suspicious manner. Kale enlists his high school buddy Ronnie (Aaron Yoo of 'Things That Go Bump in the Night') to do his legwork. Ronnie sneaks over Kale's fence into Turner's garage and finds what he believes is a corpse. Turner shows up suddenly, and Ronnie scrambles to hide from Turner in Turner's house. Kale ignores the ankle monitor and breaks into Turner's house to save Ronnie, but the police arrive in time to arrest him again. The best thing about 'Disturbia' is David Morse's stone cold killer who seems to know what these nosy teenagers are up to every step of the way. Turner maintains his cool until the finale when all havoc breaks loose. Shia LaBeouf, who looks more and more like this generation's answer to John Cusack, makes a resourceful but sympathetic character. Like the wheel chair bound James Stewart in 'Rear Window,' LaBeouf's hero cannot step out of bounds without the police showing up at the drop of a hat to bust him. As his shapely but skinny next-door neighbor Ashley, Sarah Roemer basically recreates the role that Grace Kelly played in the original. Inexplicably, however, Ashley vanishes from the action in the last quarter hour and Kale's mom has to intercede for him. Meanwhile, Aaron Yoo provides the necessary comic relief. Poor Carrie-Anne Moss has been reduced to playing the thankless role of Kale's mother. You may remember that Moss portrayed the gravity-defying heroine in 'The Matrix' trilogy that could charge full-tilt up walls and blast the daylights out of the badguys.Altogether, 'Disturbia' qualifies as a worthwhile suspenseful saga with enough surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat. Indeed, the audience that Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studio is appealing to with this gripping thriller probably haven't seen 'Rear Window' so they won't appreciate the efforts that Caruso and his writers have taken to pay homage to the Hitchcock film.",8,0,2,21 June 2007
Van Helsing," Outrageously preposterous but thoroughly entertaining!
","Writer & director Stephen Sommers reinvents the nemesis of 'Dracula' in 'Van Helsing' starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Sommers brings the same larger-than-life swashbuckling bravado to 'Van Helsing' that he brought to his macabre but campy reboot of 'The Mummy' (1932) in the blockbuster Brendan Fraser flicks 'The Mummy' (1999) and 'The Mummy Returns' (2001). Even more outrageously preposterous but thoroughly entertaining than Sommers' adrenalin-driven 'Mummy' remakes, 'Van Helsing' alters more than Dracula's archenemy. Sommers performs makeovers on the Frankenstein monster and Dracula's brides, too. Now, the Frankenstein monster fights for the good guys, while the airborne vampire brides swoop down like harpies on their victims and haul them away in their talons. Even Dracula himself undergoes changes. Stakes through the heart, garlic, crucifixes, holy water and sunlight have no effect. However, nothing is as radical as the transformation of Van Helsing. In the original 1931 'Dracula,' Professor Abraham Van Helsing was a much older man with close-cropped hair and thick glasses who practiced medicine. In other words, 60-year old vampire slayer Edward Van Sloan looked nothing like buffed up 'X-Men' star Hugh Jackman. Neither does Jackman resemble the venerable Peter Cushing, who portrayed Van Helsing as an older but more energetic professor type during the 1950s-60s in five Hammer 'Dracula' movies. An unkempt Anthony Hopkins hammed up the role in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' (1992). The closest anybody has come to Hugh Jackson's Gabriel Van Helsing is Christopher Plummer in 'Dracula 2000.' Nonetheless, even Plummer played Van Helsing as an older man armed with a deadly cross-bow. Not only does Jackman arm himself with a gas-operated, semi-automatic cross-bow, but also he totes two six-guns and a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine. For martial arts illiterates, a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine looks like a Frisbee with jagged metal edges. Young, virile, and fast on the draw, Jackman's Van Helsing dresses like an Italian western gunslinger with a black, floor-length coat and a broad-brimmed hat. His uncanny resemblance to Clint Eastwood enhances that impression.'Van Helsing' hits you with back-to-back prologues that identify the chief characters. An enraged Transylvanian mob storms Dracula's castle in the late 1880s. Evidently, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen') has given Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West of 'Notting Hill') refuge in his castle, so the scientist can complete his experiments with reanimating dead tissue. Of course, Dracula isn't generous for nothing. He has a stake in giving life to the dead offspring of him and his brides. Thousands of icky-looking embryos that dangle lifelessly from the ceiling like wasp nests clutter up Dracula's castle. Meanwhile, the Vatican dispatches Van Helsing as their troubleshooter to destroy monsters. In his opening prologue, Van Helsing appears in Paris with the Eiffel Tower under construction and battles the only non-Universal Studios monster, the Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane's voice), half of Dr. Jekyll. Afterward, our stalwart hero rides back on horse to the Vatican for new orders. Director John Carpenter first linked the Vatican with destroying vampires in his own movie 'Vampires' (1998) with James Woods as a cross-bow wielding vampire killer. Although he wears old west duds, Van Helsing acts more like James Bond. At the Vatican, the equivalent of 007's Q in the guise of Friar Carl (scene-stealing David Wenham, Faramir in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) devises a variety of gadgets for Van Helsing. Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong of 'Patriot Games') dispatches Van Helsing to save the last two members of a vampire slaying clan. They are gypsy princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale of 'Pearl Harbor') and her brother Veklan (Will Kemp of 'Mindhunters')who gets bitten by a werewolf early on in the action. Unfortunately, Veklan falls under Dracula's power and becomes his werewolf slave. Initially, neither Van Helsing nor Anna likes each other, but they join forces reluctantly to put Dracula on ice. In the middle of all this mayhem, we find the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley of 'Someone Like You') serving as the key to Dracula's efforts to give his dead offspring life.Sommers pulls out all stops in this slam-bang, high-octane, over-the-top, roller-coaster of an adventure that has vampires and werewolves battling each other. Twists follow turns in the contrived but imaginative plot, and surprises alternate with shocks. Although he has revamped those classic horror characters, Sommers' 'Van Helsing' consists more of atmospheric, computer-generated locales and harrowing jolts that occur when monsters appear suddenly behind characters for maximum shock effect. No, anybody over age 12 shouldn't suffer nightmares from this formulaic action epic, because 'Van Helsing' is basically a horror comedy. Imagine a monster mash cross-between of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are In My Neck' (1967), and you'll know what to expect of 'Van Helsing.' Nothing about 'Van Helsing' is remotely credible, but the breathlessly paced story throws so many curves that you cannot predict what is going to happen from one set-piece to the next. When Hugh Jackman isn't performing testosterone-fueled stunts, Kate Beckinsale indulges in her own estrogen-based acrobatics that make her werewolf slayer in 'Underworld' seem tame by comparison. Neither character has enough time to romance the other, because they find themselves constantly jumping through metaphorical flaming hoops in an unceasing battle with evil. If 'Van Helsing' has a flaw, it is casting Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. He looks like Dudley Moore and he lacks menace. You have to wonder why Universal couldn't have attracted a bigger star to off-set the combined star power of Beckinsale and Jackman. Ultimately, while 'Van Helsing' is never boring, the changes in these legendary horror characters probably won't bother younger audiences as much as older ones weaned on inflexible rules governing the behavior of vampires and werewolves. You'll get your money's worth out of 'Van Helsing.'",10,2,4,6 February 2008
Divergent," An Immaculate Cinematic Adaptation
","The immaculate cinematic adaptation of Veronica Roth's futuristic bestseller 'Divergent,' set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, is neither as gripping nor as gritty as its literary counterpart. I read the first installment of Ms. Roth's trilogy two weeks ago, and adventurous but formulaic best describes its narrative. Interestingly, Summit Entertainment is the same Hollywood studio that regaled us with the 'Twilight' franchise as well as the 'The Hunger Games' movies. Based on the $56-million 'Divergent' coined over its first weekend, Summit has launched its third lucrative franchise. By its second week of release, 'Divergent' should recoup the remainder of its $85 million production costs before the 'Captain America' sequel stomps it into obscurity at the box office. Comparably, 'Divergent' lacks the taboo romance of 'Twilight' and the pugnacious pluck of 'The Hunger Games.' Happily, it surpasses its closest competitors—the colorless 'Vampire Academy' and 'Twilight' novelist Stephanie Meyer's other dead-on-arrival tale 'The Host' that toplined a similarly feisty female. Chiefly, 'Divergent' differs because its' government lacks the Draconian nature of its counterpart in 'The Hunger Games.' The fascist government that keeps its boot wedged firmly against the collective neck of Katniss Everdeen, her friends and family in 'The Hunger Games' is conspicuously absent in 'Divergent.' Our heroine, Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley of 'The Descendants') isn't like Katniss, and she doesn't define herself with an iconic choice of weapons so much as a lifestyle pursuit. Ultimately, like 'The Hunger Games' and 'Star Wars,' Beatrice finds herself cornered in a flawed society that treacherous evildoers want to sabotage through any means at hand. Consequently, 'Divergent' doesn't have the built-in, ticking time bomb conflict that 'The Hunger Games' has with a rebellion. Indeed, this predicament isn't far ahead, but at least not in this origins opus. 'Divergent' incredibly surprising, but its 140 running time won't wear you out.'Limitless' director Neil Burger and 'Snow White and the Huntsman' writer Evan Daugherty and 'Game of Thrones' scribe Vanessa Taylor depict a dystopian society that has split itself into factions to prevent any one fraction from gaining the upper hand. Indeed, the unrest that lurks ominously in 'Divergent' grows out of a conspiracy between wicked members of two fractions. The message, I suppose, is old people aren't entirely trustworthy. Meanwhile, 'Divergent' opens with a gathering where teenagers can declare the fraction of their choice. At age sixteen, male and females assemble for The Choosing Ceremony. Basically, after a war that ended 100 years ago, the survivors divided themselves into a handful of groups: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Each group is based on a personality virtue. Abnegation consists of selfless people who place the needs of others before their own. They feed the poor wretches who are not members of a fraction. Amity represents the peaceful people. Candor is made up of those who exalt honesty and truth. Erudite worships intelligence and sagacity. Not surprisingly, Dauntless embraces bravery and reckless impetuosity. Our wallflower protagonist Beatrice hails from a selfless Abnegation family. Abnegates dress in gray and are contemptuously denigrated as 'stiffs.' Andrew (Tony Goldwyn of 'Ghost') and Natalie (Ashley Judd of 'Kiss the Girls') are Beatrice's parents. Caleb (Ansel Elgort of 'Carrie') is Beatrice's brother. Before The Choosing Ceremony, each teen submits to an aptitude test. The results indicate the suitable fraction for them to join. Dauntless member Tori (Maggie Q of the TV series 'Nikita') exams Beatrice. The rules dictate the test administrator must belong to a different fraction from the one the tested teen comes from. Something goes wrong with Beatrice's test. 'You're different. You don't fit into a category,' Tori confides in her. ' They can't control you. They call it Divergent. You can't let them find out about you.' Testing divergent is the worst thing that can happen to a teen in this society. No fraction will accept them if the divergent test results are made known. A sympathetic Tori warns Beatrice to conceal her status from everybody, including her parents. Nevertheless, this impediment doesn't stop Beatrice from surprising her mother and father. She joins the Dauntless. She struggles to keep up with these adrenaline junkies. They love to scale the elevate railway platforms and scramble aboard trains as the trains are breezing out of the station. Getting off these trains proves to be even more challenging! The Dauntless expects them to leap off the trains and land on nearby rooftops. Eventually, Beatrice renames herself Tris and braves perils galore during her initiation ritual, including a homicide attempt on her life. Gradually, she evolves from a lowly worm to a self-propelled butterfly with a kick. Along the way, she attracts the eye of one of her superiors, Four (Theo James of 'Underworld: Awakening'), and an amorous relationship develops between the two.Anybody who has read Roth's novel shouldn't be surprised by the textual omissions Burger and his scenarists have deleted some of the more violent scenes. The use of chemicals to test Dauntless faction members, especially with regard to their fears, resembles the missions in 'The Matrix.' Like 'The Matrix,' 'Divergent' wrestles with the theme of conformity. Our tenacious heroine learns how to handle herself during boot camp combat. As the finale appears on her horizon, Tris knows more about those she loved that she didn't know. She finds more strength in herself than she thought impossible, too. She enters the Dauntless world as an expendable but emerges triumphant. The scene on the Ferris wheel is cool. Casting is letter perfect. Actress Shailene Woodley was born to play Beatrice. She looks comfortable in the role. Although co-star Theo James appears a little too old as her boyfriend Four, the two generate chemistry and that makes us care about them. 'Titanic's' Kate Winslet plays the chief villain, and Jai Courtney of 'Live Free: is appropriately sinister as Eric, who ranks above Four in the Dauntless hierarchy. Nothing about 'Divergent' is remotely offensive, but its strong cast maintains our attention as does its futuristic designs.",9,11,40,24 March 2014
Ender's Game," Mediocre At Best
","Parents have complained since the dawn of creation that children grow up too quickly. The urchins in 'Ender's Game,' based on Orson Scott Card's allegorical but fascist 1985 science fiction novel, must grow up far more quickly if mankind hopes to survive a second cataclysmic intergalactic extraterrestrial invasion. The pugnacious aliens determined to destroy humanity are called Formics, and they resemble praying mantises. These predatory Formics constitute a far more perilous foe than any other that Earth has ever encountered. Launching a Pearl Harbor-style attack, these formidable bugs surprised Earthlings and nearly devastated us. Fortunately, one hero emerged to repulse the deadly invasion. Anxious about surviving a second assault, the military establishes a program to indoctrinate children in the art of warfare. It seems that kids are far better equipped to triumph over their adversaries than any adults. War has always been a young man's fight, while the elders supervise strategy safely behind the lines. The conceit of writer & director Gavin Hood's 'Ender's Game' is that innocent adolescents stand a better chance of saving society than their elders. Since I haven't read Scott's popular bestsellers, I cannot say for sure what Hood left on the cutting room floor. Nevertheless, according to one fan that I chatted with the day I saw the film, Hood deleted a great deal, but none of the missing segments seriously disturbed her. Mind you, 'Ender's Game' isn't the first movie where children have had to resort to violence. The three problems that I have with 'Ender's Game' are the anticlimactic scripting, the lackluster villains, and the overabundance of simulation without a shred of suspense. Never for one moment in this 114-minute science fiction extravaganza did I feel that our heroes were in jeopardy. 'Ender's Game' stars Harrison Ford, but he doesn't engage in any 'Star Wars' heroics. He wears a uniform, a closely trimmed hair-cut, and growls his dialogue with convincing menace. He neither wields a weapon of any sort nor does his aide played Viola Davis. Aside from Ford and Davis, the cast consists of children from a rainbow of ethnic denominations. 'Ender's Game' applauds multiculturalism but deplores the necessity to steal the innocence of youth.Fifty years have elapsed since the warmongering Formics sought to destroy Earth. Had it not been for the intervention of legendary fighter pilot Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley of 'Iron Man 3'), humanity would have disappeared from the galaxy. Apparently, Rackham died in combat when he committed suicide by crashing his fighter into a Formic battle cruiser. The destruction of that battle cruiser took the spirit out of the Formics and they retreated back to their home planet. As it turns out, the news of Rackham's demise was greatly exaggerated. Meantime, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford of 'Cowboys & Aliens') and his superiors suspect that the Formics will embark on another all-out effort to vanquish mankind. Since they feel youth is their best weapon against the Formics, they have set up military academies to train young leaders. Now, Graff is convinced that he has discovered the ideal strategist to take the fight to the Formics. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield of 'Hugo') qualifies as a classic underdog. He is a ten-year old who doesn't fit in well with others. Nevertheless, Graff admires Ender's tenacity to pummel his opponents into submission without a qualm. The only thing that bothers Graff and military psychologist Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis of 'The Help') is that Ender might have a latent streak of sadism. Earlier, the International Fleet had pinned their hopes on Ender's older brother Peter (Jimmy Jax Pinchak of 'Let Me In'), but he turns out to be a sadist. Graff has Ender transferred to a training station orbiting the Earth and pits him against the best of the best who have proved their mettle in simulated warfare. Ender defeats each of them. Furthermore, Ender befriends surly Drill Sergeant Dap (Nonso Anozie of 'Conan the Barbarian') who appears to have nothing but contempt for youngsters. Eventually, Ender learns Mazer Rackham didn't die, and Ender must prove himself to the legendary pilot. Mazer doesn't have Graff's faith in Ender, but Ender wins over Mazer. What bothers Ender is that Graff may be lying to him about each new battle simulation. Secretly, Ender isn't certain if he is playing a game or playing for real.The first half of 'Ender's Game' tops the second half. Initially, Hood dwells on our hero's confrontations with bullies at military academies. Indisputably, the filmmakers argue that bullying is as harmful for the bullies as it is for their victims. Ender relies on his agile wits to topple his tormentors who not only out-number him but also are far more cynical. Nothing about these fights is simulated. Vividly, Ender goes head-to-head with his enemies, while Hood aligns our sympathies with him. The raw violence that Hood orchestrates in these instances far surpasses the simulated, computer game quality of Ender's fights with the Formics. Top-notch adventure movies boast strong, intimidating villains. Watching 'Ender's Game' reminded me of 'Starship Troopers' where the Arachnids posed a genuine threat to mankind. Unfortunately, Hood depicts only one Formic in 'Ender's Game,' and this Formic is harmless. During the massive battles, we never see the Formics in their own battleships, only their ships. This shortage of Formics suggests that Hood didn't want to make them too antagonistic. Essentially, the Formics don't contain a shred of personality. You cannot abhor a villain who never appears either aggressive or hostile. Virtually all of the battles that Ender engages in with the Formics are presented from the perspective of a video gamer. Anybody who has read Orson Scott Card's novels knows the fight is far from over at fade-out. The last minute surprise will make you wonder whether we should have aligned our sympathies with our own species at the expense of another culture. Performances, especially those of the children, are compelling. Meanwhile, 'Ender's Game' never quickened my pulse.",5,1,5,27 November 2013
Save the Last Dance," Good Performances in a feel-good movie with contrived situations
","'Save the Last Dance' is a fish-out-of-water fable about 17-year old white bread wannabe ballet dancer Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles of 'The Bourne Ultimatum') who loses her mom in a tragic car accident and finds her world turned upside down when she has to join her estranged father, jazz musician Roy Johnson (Terry Kinney of 'Oxygen'), in Chicago and attend a predominantly African-American high school.The contrived but well-intentioned Duane Adler & Cheryl Edwards screenplay severely strains credibility because it propels an outsider into a predicament that nobody in their right mind would countenance, even Sara's loser father. Sara is literally the only Caucasian girl in the entire school, at least the only one that we can relate to in a meaningful way. Yes, several other white girls attend the school, but we catch only a glimpse of them during lunch. Sara has to move in with her father in his cramped, decrepit inner-city apartment because her mom died in an accident on the way to watch her daughter audition for the prestigious Julliard Dance Academy. Love starved Sara blames herself for her mother's death and renounces ballet until she becomes involved with a bright African-American high school student, Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas of 'Dracula 2000'), that attracts her attention during her first day of classes when they argue about Truman Capote in their literature class. Eventually, Sara and Derek become an item, much to the chagrin of Derek's jealous ex-girlfriend Nikki (Bianca Lawson of 'Primary Colors') and Derek's sister Chenille (Kerry Washington of 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith') who resents Sara as a white girl intruding into places that she shouldn't be.Chenille feels like Sara is a persona non grata taking advantage of her lily white skin to pull a black man out of his culture. Chenille and Sara have an on-and-off friendship and Chenille's problem with Sara grows out of her own lousy relationship with her boyfriend/out-of-wedlock father to her illegitimate child who refuses to take responsibility for his part in their own relationship. Meanwhile, Derek has problems with his own circle of friends, principally his supposed 'boy' Malakia (shaven headed Fredro Starr of 'Torque') who once took the rap for him years earlier. This theme of one friend taking the fall for another in a crime is as old as the James Cagney & Pat O'Brien crime thriller 'Angels with Dirty Faces.' Later, when Derek realizes how much Sara means to him and how little Malakia does with his criminal shenanigans, Derek abandons Malakia and focuses entirely on Sara. Indeed, Derek nurtures Sara, teaches her the basics of hip-hop dancing, and becomes intimate enough with her that she shares her dream of being a ballerina.At the same time that all of his drama is transpiring, Sara has to deal with her father; Roy realizes that he hasn't been a role model for her himself. Derek is unlike his other black friends because he aspires to get out of the ghetto and move on to bigger and better things, namely, he wants to attend Georgetown University and become a pediatrician.'Save the Last Dance' is a teen romance with a protagonist Sara who doesn't realize how different that she is from all her other friends in a largely black high school. She has a run-in with Nikki that lands them both in detention. She gets to experience first-hand the disadvantages that blacks contend with in the ghetto, especially when Chenille has to wait for hours at a clinic for an appointment with her son. During these scenes some semblance of racial tension and the problems that blacks deal with come out of the Adler & Edwards script. Thomas stages a couple of drive-by shootings and the African-Americans rant about respect and trade lead with other blacks. 'Save the Last Dance' confines most of the racial tension to the background. Not surprisingly, there is a happy ending, but things as well as actors change in the straight-to-video sequel. Good performances by Stiles and Thomas bolster this above-average but clichéd opus.",7,0,3,22 February 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Top-Notch Thriller!!!
","If you saw both versions of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' side by side, you could spot the differences between the Swedish original and the American remake. Nevertheless, if you've seen one, the revelations in the other won't surprise you. Mind you, 'Fight Club' director David Fincher brings his obsession with serial killers with him to this first-rate adaptation of Stieg Larsson's international bestseller. Fincher scored his first major cinematic success with the crime thriller 'Se7en' (1995) about a serial killer, and he explored the theme again in 'Zodiac' (2007) a film about the real-life slayings in San Francisco. Considering that the lurid subject matter of Larsson's novel concerns a man who murders women, the pairing of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and Fincher seems ideal. Oscar winning 'Schindler's List' scenarist Steven Zaillian brings his formidable skills to bear as the sole scribe. Indeed, little is amiss in the Fincher & Zaillian retread, except cat lovers probably won't appreciate the butchered feline that winds up on our hero's door step. The cat was conspicuous by its absence in the Swedish version. Perhaps the biggest difference between the films is the casting of Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace registered brilliantly as the eponymous heroine in the original, but newcomer Rooney Mara is no slouch. Mara wears insanity as persuasively as her black, boot-polish Goth make-up and her punk rock coiffures. Any preference you have may boil down to your choice between either Ms. Rapace or Ms. Mara. Each deliver unforgettable performances, and the Lisbeth Salander character is going to be remembered as one of the strongest images of women in film since the titular character in the French action yarn 'La Femme Nikita.' Aging Swedish business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer of 'The Sound of Music') fears that he has few years left. The mysterious disappearance of his niece Harriet is the one thing which has haunted him for 40 years. She vanished without a trace one day during a family reunion. Neither the authorities nor Henrik were ever able to find her. To add insult to injury, Henrik has received a framed flower picture annually on each birthday. Harriet gave him the first flower, but lately Henrik suspects that all subsequent flowers since she disappeared have been sent by Harriet's killer. Henrik feels like he is being ridiculed and he has suffered from this torment long enough. He hires an illustrious Swedish political journalist who writes for the magazine 'Millennium.' A reluctant Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig of 'Casino Royale') accepts Vanger's job offer since he has just lost a highly publicized libel suit against a notorious Swedish billionaire investment banker, Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg of 'Exit'), and the court settlement has wiped out his savings. Henrik commissions Blomkvist to write his memoirs in part because he abhors the corrupt Wennerström. Moreover, he possesses files on Wennerström which will damage the billionaire's reputation and he promises to give them to Blomkvist after he completes his assignment. What Blomkvist doesn't know is that Henrik's attorney, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff of 'Octopussy'), has employed Milton Security to conduct a background check on Blomkvist. The individual who does the background check is a 23-year old girl, Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara of 'Youth in Revolt'), and she leaves no stone unturned. Once Henrik hires Blomkvist, he describes his family as rather repugnant. Two of his brothers joined the Nazi Party during World War II. Some don't talk to each other even though they live in houses on an island linked to the mainland by a single bridge. Furthermore, Henrik suspects one of them may have murdered poor Harriet. Henrik installs Blomkvist in a nearby cottage and provides him with every shred of evidence that the police used in their investigation. Later, things go awry when Henrik suffers a heart attack, and everybody but Frode expects him to die. At the hospital, some of Henrik's relatives demand Blomkvist be dismissed, but Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsgård of 'Thor') convinces the family to allow Blomkvist to complete Henrik's chronicle. Meantime, Lisbeth encounters her own woes when her guardian suffers a stroke, and the state replaces him. Lisbeth, it seems, has a life filled with tragedy. We learn later she burned her abusive father over eighty per cent of his body because he beat her mother without mercy. Since her assault on her father, Lisbeth has been in trouble and is now a ward of the state. The state transfers Lisbeth over to Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen of 'Soul Assassin') who displays a hostile attitude to Lisbeth. They get off on the wrong foot, but Lisbeth manages to bring him around to her way of thinking. Eventually, Blomkvist finds the mystery so overwhelming that he asks Frode for an assistant and Frode recommends Lisbeth. Together, they struggle to not only find clues but also to interpret those clues correctly. If anything differentiates the two films, the casting disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist does. Stockholm born actor Michael Nyqvist appears more believable in the original, but English born actor Daniel Craig holds his own in the remake. Actually, were it not for radical, off-beat character of Lisbeth, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' would amount to little more than a complex European whodunit set in a scenic, snow-swept wonderland. In fact, it is Lisbeth who gives the film its lurid but gripping quality. She assumes a role of greater significance in the Swedish sequels and probably will in the American sequels. She emerges as a female Rambo with a no-nonsense attitude. If she were a cat, she would claw more often than purr. Although 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' clocks in at a lengthy 158 minutes, director David Fincher doesn't squander a second. He knows the right moment to cut away from one scene to another to heighten suspense. Furthermore, despite the graphic crime scene photos and the misogyny, Fincher is careful enough to never rub our noses in it.",10,4,11,5 January 2012
Face_Off," One of John Woo's Best American Crime Thrillers!
","No, surgeons cannot carve your face off and graft it onto somebody else like they do to John Travolta and Nicolas Cage in 'Face/Off,' a provocative, high-voltage crime thriller. Surgeons may eventually perfect this operation, but for now it is impossible. Just because real surgeons cannot cut off faces and slap them onto other people, however, need not deter their ersatz Hollywood counterparts. Face swapping makes for an audacious movie premise, especially when it plays a key part in the razzle-dazzle, bullet-riddled duel of champions from celebrated Hong Kong action helmer John Woo. If you've seen the Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller 'Hard Target' or the previous Travolta epic 'Broken Arrow,' you've been Woo-ed. If you've never rented Woo's super-charged video classics, such as 'The Killer,' 'A Better Tomorrow,' and 'Hard Boiled,' you've missed some of the coolest thrillers since 'Miami Vice' left the airwaves.Nicolas Cage is cast as the insanely evil terrorist Castor Troy. Troy shoots Federal Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta of 'Broken Arrow'), but his bullet passes through Archer and kills Archer's young son Michael. Archer has made it his crusade to capture Castor Troy. Six year later, Archer catches up with him. Castor has just planted a bomb with a plague that's 'a tad worse than Gulf War Syndrome.' Before Castor can fly away, a task force of choppers, cars, and SWAT sharpshooters converge on the airport. This scene evokes memories of the Bond movie 'License to Kill.' Like the Bond villain, Castor finds his jet stopped and the Feds swarming over it. He manages to kill a few before he is trapped in the deadly draft of a wind tunnel.Everybody cheers Sean Archer. Castor lies in a coma, while his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola in an effective performance) rots in prison. When the Feds inspect Troy's plane, they find a computer disc and learn about the bomb. Just when Archer thought it was safe to cross the street, BOOM! An initial dragnet of Castor Troy's accomplices yields a date, but Pollus refuses to talk. At least to anyone other than his brother Castor. That's when a black bag, super-secret operation is mounted. Hollis Miller (CCH Pounders of 'RoboCop 3') persuades Archer to swap mugs with Troy. With the specter of a devastating plague in L.A., Archer consent to their harebrained scheme.The ingenious Mike Werb and Michael Colleary screenplay piles on absurdities galore with the same reckless abandon that some fast food restaurants heap on the lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes. 'Face/Off' spins itself off of the well worn plot when the good guy has to go so deep undercover that the only people who can help him are the first ones who the villains slay. If you've seen Burt Reynolds in Joseph Sargent's 'White Lightning' (1973), or Paul Newman in John Huston's 'The MacKintosh Man' (1973), or Johnny Depp in the recent Al Pacino caper 'Donnie Brasco,' you know the plot basics. 'Face/Off' is an unbelievable thriller that dresses itself up with realism. Even if half of the stuff in 'Face/Off' couldn't happen, director John Woo stages it so that it looks not only pictorially possible but visually splendid. The idea that John Travolta and Nicolas Cage can swap bodies is hokum of a clever but far-fetched nature. So the movie makers rely on the indulgence of the audience. Of course, Travolta cannot become anything like Cage. But it's fun to see how their characters change in this out-of-body experience. And the movie makers go a step further when they include a surgical scene that is an homage to those old Hammer horror movies when Dr. Frankenstein dunked everything in a fish tank! If you like movies where the heroes spend a lot of time trading shots with each other, 'Face/Off' should be the right caliber for you. The arsenal of weapons is impressive; especially Castor Troy's matched brace of gold-plated automatic pistols. Werb and Colleary chart the vendetta between Archer and Troy in a series of deliriously poetic shoot-outs that resemble a Sergio Leone extravaganza. You see bullets after they have been discharged leaving the barrel. Whenever it looks like it's going to run out of plot, 'Face/Off' loosens a burst or two of ammo in a gunfight. You get to see a lot of reloading close-ups. Every time a bullet hits anything, whatever it struck erupts into a fountain of shards. And then you have the cameras gliding through all of this mayhem with stunt people jerking and tumbling, shell casings flying, and guys dodging bullets. Woo surprisingly keeps blood and gore to a minimum.The heroes and villains in 'Face/Off' want to destroy each other. Archer is the straight-arrow hero and Troy is the villain. It's a classic example of the struggle between good and evil. As villains go, Troy is mean to the marrow. He drips evil in a slinky, malignant way. He revels in violence for fun and profit. 'Face/Off' tampers little with this image, except where Troy shows concern for his younger brother Pollux by constantly tying his shoes. When Castor gets his comeuppance, you want to cheer because he grows increasingly slimy as the plot thickens.John Travolta alternates between jaw clenched expressions of rage and soul searching displays of agony. He allows his commitment to the law drive him beyond it. His heroism is tainted by grief for his dead son and his desire to kill Castor. This is one of Travolta's more toxic performances, especially when he absorbs Castor's personality.The undersea prison in 'Face/Off' is straight out of a sci-fi movie and another subtle hint about what director John Woo faced if he had remained in Hong Kong. In this prison, which is constructed of steel, the convicts wear steel boots. When a riot breaks out, the guards magnetize the convicts' boots and zap them with cattle prods. The symbolism of 'Face/Off' is fundamental. Woo shows us that there is a little good and evil in us all.",10,6,10,11 July 2009
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Top-Notch Action Yarn
","The latest installment in the 'Mission: Impossible' film franchise ranks as one of the best. 'Jack Reacher' director Christopher McQuarrie's 'Mission: Impossible--Rogue Nation' rivals its superlative predecessor 'Mission: Impossible--Ghost Protocol' with spine-tingling suspense and spectacularly staged set-pieces. Mind you, things haven't always been so good. The initial 'Mission: Impossible' movie was arguably exciting enough in its own right, especially when Tom Cruise suspended himself Spider-man style at CIA Headquarters. Nevertheless, the film portrayed one of the most beloved television series characters in such a sacrilegious light that most television 'Mission: Impossible' fanatics abhorred it. I grew up watching Peter Graves play Jim Phelps from 1967 to 1973 and again briefly from 1988 to 1990 on the weekly, hour-long, CBS-TV program, and the heretical notion that Phelps could turn traitor constituted blasphemy. Little did it matter that the people who produced 'Mission: Impossible' gave Phelps legitimate grounds for his treachery. Comparably, this would be tantamount to turning either Marshal Dillon of 'Gunsmoke' into a murderous outlaw or indicting Andy Griffith's Sheriff Andy Taylor for police brutality. The second entry in the Paramount franchise 'Mission Impossible II' emerged as a vast improvement over the original. Unfortunately, the stimulating third installment 'Mission Impossible III' made an error almost as egregious as defaming Jim Phelps. Tom Cruise and director J.J. Abrams gave Ethan Hunt a wife to worry about, and that matrimonial madness provided the motive force in its contrived melodrama. The secret agent with a double life and a wife is the stuff of spoofs, and the marriage plot was predictable. Perhaps if they had substituted Hunt's parents (remember them from the 1996 original?) for his wife, the idea might have been more palatable. As swiftly as the franchise got Ethan hitched, it got him just as quickly unhitched with ambiguous details. 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' kept Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) separated from his wife, and he reverted to single status as he had in 'Mission Impossible II.' Happily, neither Cruise nor his latest collaborators have pulled anything as foolhardy as 'Mission Impossible III' with 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.'Like the best James Bond extravaganzas, 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' opens with a cliffhanger gambit. Ethan Hunt scrambles atop the wing of a military cargo plane, an Airbus A400M, as it trundles down the runaway for take-off. He slaloms off the wing down to the fuselage and seizes the door handle. Hunt's cyber genius colleague Benjamin Dunn (Simon Pegg of 'Shaun of the Dead') struggles to open the door remotely while Hunt clings desperately for dear life as the plane gains altitude. Frantically, Benji opens the wrong door, but eventually opens the right door. Hunt gains access to the cargo hold and spots the pallet of VX-nerve gas missiles. The villains, a band of Chechen separatist fighters, discover Hunt's presence too late, and he deploys the chute on the pallet, so both the missiles and he plunge into the blue. This snappy incident is peripheral to the plot, but it gets this outlandish escapade off on the right foot. Moreover, this tense scene reunites Hunt with not only Benji, but also series regular Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of 'Pulp Fiction') and 'Ghost Protocol' addition William Brandt (Jeremy Renner of 'The Bourne Legacy'). This time around our heroic quartet wrestles with their worst nightmare: the Syndicate, an enigmatic league of terrorists, alluded to at the end of 'Ghost Protocol,' that threatens not only to destroy the IMF but also initiate global chaos. Predictably, of course, we know Hunt and company will preserve the status quo. Nevertheless, writer & director Christopher McQuarrie takes everything straight to the brink and then lets it teeter. Earlier 'Mission Impossible' movies relied on the plot device of 'disavowing' Ethan Hunt so he wound up as the man in the middle between the good guys and the bad guys. 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' raises the stakes considerably by ostracizing the entire IMF Agency, with bureaucratic, stuffed-shirt CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alex Baldwin of 'The Hunt for Red October') arguing passionately for the IMF's dissolution after the infamous San Francisco incident involving a Russian nuclear missile. Meantime, in London, Hunt stumbles accidentally onto the Syndicate. This shadowy organization consists of thousands of spies who have deserted and are officially listed as dead. Pretty but pugnacious Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson of 'The White Queen'), an undercover British Intelligence agent who follows orders from Syndicate honcho Solomon Kane (Sean Harris of 'Prometheus') acts as if she is a double agent.'Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation' delivers everything that we've come to expect from this intrigue-laden, gadget- encumbered franchise. Our resourceful heroes still wear those latex masks that they peel off at dramatic moments to surprise us. As usual, they are required to break into and out of various buildings bristling with sophisticated security safeguards that sometimes challenge them to the point of death. The debonair 53-year old Cruise performs his own perilous stunts, virtually all of them hair-raising, acrobatic accomplishments. He careens a small car around in a maze of narrow city streets with the villains in hot pursuit and then launches himself astride a motorcycle with daredevil gusto. Director Christopher McQuarrie succeeds at making everything doubly difficult for our protagonists, and they embark on an improbable but death-defying gauntlet of obstacles that would stymie lesser souls. Several scenes benefit from gripping tension because one set of heroes execute tasks that prevent another hero from either being captured or killed. Cruise and co-star Rebecca Ferguson team up in several helter-skelter, close quarters, combat scenes that surely required lots of rehearsal. Ferguson displays dazzling dexterity when she clashes with a henchman twice her size who wields a knife far larger than hers. One of the best sequences has Cruise debating which villain to perforate before either assassinates a foreign dignitary during a live opera performance. The fifth globe-trotting 'Mission Impossible' foray qualifies as a rapid-fire, white-knuckled, adrenaline-laced, nail-biter with momentum that never slackens and surprises that astonish.",10,0,2,10 August 2015
Spider-Man," Despite its narrative flaws, 'Spider-man' hangs tough.
","'Evil Dead' director Sam Raimi spins an uneven but entertaining web of excitement, suspense, and romance in Columbia Pictures' new live-action 'Spider-man' movie based on the venerable Marvel Comics character. Although it lacks the depth and intelligence of Bryan Singer's 'X-Men,' 'Spider-man' compares favorably with Richard Donner's standard-bearing epic 'Superman' (1978). Each poked fun at themselves in straight-faced fashion, but neither let their villains overshadow the heroes as Tim Burton did in his Michael Keaton 'Batman' yarns. The offbeat but inspired casting of Tobey Maguire as Spider-man and Willem Dafoe as the villainous Green Goblin virtually compensates for two unforgivable flaws which neither Raimi nor veteran scripter David Koepp resolve in an entirely satisfactory manner. Meanwhile, John Dykstra of the original 'Star Wars' serves up some credible digital special effects that allow audiences to websling their way vicariously through the Big Apple with Spidey. Happily, these CGI sequences seamlessly integrate with Maguire's dialogue scenes in his red & blue, body stocking costume. Shrewdly, Raimi and Koepp obliterate the 'Spider- man' mask during the climactic fight, so Maquire's personality enlivens his heroic posturings. 'Spider-man' follows the 'Superman' formula about Spidey's origins, so you need not be a Marvel Comics arachnophile to enjoy this blockbuster. The action unfolds in a high school setting like 'Can't Hardly Wait' with dorky protagonist, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire of 'Wonder Boys') warning the fainthearted about the trials and tribulations that confound a superhero. When we meet him, Peter is obsessed with class beauty Mary Jane Watson (cleavage-baring Kirsten Dunst of 'Small Soldiers'), but she doesn't know he exists. They live next door to each other and attend the same senior high in the New York City borough of Queens. The jocks harass Peter unmercifully, but he survives their ridicule with no ill effects. Things change dramatically on a class field trip to Columbia University. A 'genetically designed super spider' bites Peter. When he awakens the following morning, Peter discovers to his disbelief that he no longer needs glasses and has a weight lifter's physique. Miraculously, he finds he can squirt webs out of his wrists and scale walls. Not long afterward, the Green Goblin, a power-hungry maniac on a jet glider who wreaks havoc wherever he flies, confronts Spidey and invites him to team up as his partner-in-crime. Of course, Spider-man refuses, and Goblin attacks Spider-man's aunt and his girlfriend Mary Jane.The worst thing about 'Spider-man' is our hero cuts a rather dull figure when we cannot see Tobey Maguire's expressive countenance. The only time Hollywood conceals movie stars is when stunt men double for them. The first half of 'Spider-man' surpasses the second half, because the complexity of the former abates during the latter. Inexplicably, Goblin neglects to unmask and/or kill Spidey after he captures him! Later, during a standoff involving a detached cable car, Goblin forces Spidey to choose who to rescue: his girlfriend Mary Jane or the cable car passengers. Predictably, Spidey saves both with one strand. Nevertheless, despite its narrative flaws, 'Spider-man' hangs tough.",8,0,1,11 July 2007
Jarhead," If Forrest Gump Had Gone to Iraq
","Oscar-winning 'American Beauty' director Sam Mendes's new movie 'Jarhead' qualifies more as a rowdy, sometimes unsavory Marine Corps service comedy than either an anti-war epic or a mission-oriented adventure opus. The First Gulf War memoirs of a Marine in a scout/sniper outfit served as the basis for 'Apollo 13' scenarist William Broyles, Jr.'s faithful but politically muted screenplay. Real-life Lance Corporal Anthony Swofford had few kind words for the presidency of George Bush the elder or the contrived reasons that America sought to protect the Saudi Arabian oil fields from Saddam Hussein's marauding Iraqi Army. As graphically profane as the R-rated 'Jarhead' may strike those innocents that never saw Stanley Kubrick's incendiary 1987 Vietnam classic 'Full Metal Jacket,' this military movie emerges as relatively clean-scrubbed compared with the eloquent but earthy sentiments that Swofford describes in his page-turning book. Although they don't recreate Swofford's insightful saga detail for detail, Mendes and Broyles manage to capture the sense of futility that the Marines felt in a war where the Pentagon kept them hobbled in a mind-numbing state of readiness with no pay-off in terms of combat. Indeed, 'Jarhead' combines the raunchy juvenile pranks of those salacious 1980's teenager sex comedies like 'Porky's,' minus the naked women, with the traditional military hijinks of Marion Hargrove's comic experiences in his 1944 novel 'See Here, Private Hargrove' about life in a U.S. Army boot camp. Unlike violent combat shoot'em ups such as Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down' (2001), 'Jarhead' emerges as anti-climactic, because the sudden surrender of Saddam's army in First Gulf War wound up being ostensibly anti-climactic itself. Ultimately, this Desert Shield/Desert Storm movie laments the boredom and loneliness that afflicted modern warriors honed to edge of perfection and dispatched half-way around the world in a giant sandbox with little chance of showing off their lethal skills.Imagine 'Forrest Gump' in the First Gulf War, and you've got the basics of 'Jarhead.' Definitely a movie not to bolster recruiting efforts, this indulgent, two-hour plus marathon chronicles a young man's odyssey from Boot Camp to the deserts of Saudi Arabia on the eve of war. The opening five minutes when we watch Swofford submit to a driller instructor's abuse pales considerably with similar shenanigans in 'Full Metal Jacket' or Sidney Furie's 'The Boys in Company C' (1978). Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx of 'Ray') convinces Swoffas he is later calledto try out for sniper school. Miraculously, Swoff turns out to be a crack shot. The snipers train until they can space three shots into a dime-sized circle on a target. Eventually, Swofford and his sniper sidekick Troy (Peter Sarsgaard of 'Flightplan') get their chance to zero an Iraqi officer into their cross-hairs when a free-wheeling Marine Major (Dennis Haysbert of 'Absolute Power') intervenes and orders them to stand down, so the Air Force can not only wipe the enemy officers out but also surprise the troops on the ground. Instead of seeing service, our Marine heroes languish in a limbo of sorts that exacts both a physical and emotional toll on them. 'Jarhead' dispels many heroic myths about the American fighting man and the way he juggles the fear and anxiety that precedes combat.'Donnie Darko' star Jake Gyllenhaal is wholly believable as the title character who originally wanted nothing to do with the Marine Corps. Gyllenhaal plays Lance Corporal Swofford as a multi-faceted, down-to-earth individual who alternately appears gung-ho among his comrades as well as anxious of what lies ahead against the overwhelming numbers of Saddam's army. He refuses to imitate stereotypical Hollywood warriors, like John Wayne's invincible sergeant in 'Sands of Iwo Jima' (1949), and creates a memorable character that stands out because he is as vulnerable as he is virile. As goofy as Gyllenhaal looks with his vacant-eyed stare, he delivers a performance that combines comedy with drama in a way that Tom Hanks excelled at before he packed on the pounds for pretentious movies like 'The Green Mile' (1999) and 'Cast Away' (2001). 'Sling Blade' co-star Lucas Black stands out as a plain-spoken Texas redneck who cries censorship when Jamie Foxx's staff sergeant warns him about what he can tell the press. After last summer's debacle of 'Stealth,' Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx has a role that he can truly sink his chops into and his multi-dimensional performance as a hard-bitten but compassionate non-com lifer. 'Jarheads' serves up lusty below-the-belt laughs galore, muscular performances by a sturdy cast, but this occasionally fatigue-inducing, non-combat outing suffers. Primarily, 'Jarhead' undercuts any substance that it might have had with its lightweight portrayal of Marines in limbo and the First Gulf War that it covers is as anti-climactic as the filmmakers' decision not to entangle themselves in the sticky politics that landed American's fighting men for the first time in Saudi Arabia.",7,1,3,16 June 2007
Dark City," 'Dark City' Contains More Ka-Ka Than Kafka!
","Austrian novelist Franz Kafka would probably applaud everything but the aliens and the ending in 'Crow' director Alex Proyas' 'Dark City.' This gloomy but optimistic science-fiction murder-mystery features Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, and Kiefer Sutherland. Best when only gazed at, 'Dark City' relies more on its hypnotic visuals than its shallow, predictable script.Comparatively, 'Dark City' resembles Orson Welles' 1963 classic 'The Trial,' based on the Kafka novel. An innocent man (Anthony Perkins) awakens one morning to find himself accused of an unknown crime that he didn't commit in what resembles a police state. Kafka serves merely as an aesthetic departure point for 'Dark City.' After establishing its metaphorical bond with Kafka, 'Dark City' degenerates into a humdrum, happy-ending melodrama of the comic book variety.Despite its stunning technical virtuosity, 'Dark City' frustrates anyone who scrutinizes its eye-popping style for a modicum of substance. Proyas' cinematic effort delivers few fresh ideas with its contrived, low-brow saga about humanity, individuality, and alien mind control. Worse, most of the ideas and imagery cobbled together in this predictable futuristic opus came from more entertaining movies. Suffice to say, 'Dark City' contains more kaka than Kafka.'Dark City' unravels as a pallid yarn about paranoia. Rufus Sewell of 'Dangerous Beauty' impersonates a nondescript nobody who emerges as the savior of Proyas' brooding potboiler. Waking up in a dingy bathtub in a strange hotel, John Murdoch (Sewell) finds blood seeping from his forehead. Afflicted with amnesia, he stumbles onto the naked corpse of a murdered hooker. No sooner has Murdoch gathered his wits than he gets a sudden phone call from creepy Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland of 'Young Guns'). Murdoch learns that he is supposed to be a serial killer of prostitutes. Eluding an ominous gang of knife-wielding fiends, our hero embarks on a search for his identity.Murdoch confronts a grave new world where the sun never shines. Everything grinds to a spooky halt every night at midnight. A bizarre cabal of aliens is secretly experimenting with humans. They want to see how people react to a variety of different circumstances. They change the memories of these poor beggars as if their minds were Rubik's cubes. These cryptic characters are called 'Strangers.' This pale, cadaverous, mob dresses alike in long, black leather, Gestapo coats and dark hats to conceal their white cue ball heads. Not only does sunlight irritate them, but they also abhor moisture.We're told by the mad scientist narrator that the 'Strangers' are as old as time. They travel great distances by levitation. Endowed with the power to alter physical reality by a telepathic process called 'tuning,' these dour 'Strangers' can create doors in walls where no portals existed. Visually, their power is depicted as a slinky-like series of transparent concentric circles rippling out from the center of their foreheads. Oddly enough, these 'Strangers' are dying. All men and one boy, they are convinced that their survival lies in mankind. Before they can achieve their goal, these 'Strangers' must deduce what makes mankind 'human.' The 'Strangers' have abducted humans and taken them to a world they have created to figure out what makes mankind tick.'Dark City' has a drab, monolithic plot with several inherent theatrical flaws.First, the filmmakers provide less than sensational heroics in the various skirmishes between the hero and the villains. 'Dark City' fails to thrill because the leads are never in jeopardy. Moreover, when characters find themselves in danger, the challenge has a muted quality. The climactic 'tuning' battle between Mr. Book (Ian Richardson of 'Man of La Mancha') and Murdoch lacks a credible quotient of violence. Second, too many characters clutter up the film! Inspector Frank Bumstead, a supporting character who is clearly more interesting than Murdoch, should have been the hero. Further, the movie makers should have combined Bumstead's role with the insane victim cop, Eddie Walenski (Colin Friels of 'Darkman'). Their synthesized characters would have made a more exciting hero. Third, we're never told how the hero acquired his ability to 'tune.' This is a pretty serious flaw because 'tuning' makes Murdock equal to his enemies. Worse, Dr. Schreber has no idea either, and he is the guy who concocted the stuff that he injects into the foreheads of the human with his baroque syringes. Fourth, 'Dark City' suffers because the filmmakers refuse to tell us enough about these enigmatic 'Strangers.' They are a cryptic bunch that occupies space somewhere between Uncle Fester of 'The Adams Family' and Clive Barker's Pin-Head.William Hurt of 'The Big Chill' appears as a hard-boiled, accordion-playing detective determined to capture Murdoch. Wasted in a subordinate role, Hurt has little chance to develop anything more than a sketchy character. While it's always a pleasure to watch the eloquent Hurt, his cop character receives deplorable treatment. 'Dark City' consigns sexy Jennifer Connelly to the cosmetic role of the woman-in-distress. Murdoch eventually gets around to saving her from the clutches of the Strangers near the end of the movie. Connelly and Sewell generate few sparks as lovers. She spends most of her screen time doing unremarkable things.Droopy-eyed Kiefer Sutherland chews the scenery as a stereotypical Dr. Moreau geneticist with everything but a Peter Lorre sneer. He sports quirky clothes, adopts an accent and shuffles rather than walks. As one of the movie's chief characters, Dr. Schreber strikes neither a villainous nor heroic posture. He mixes and matches genes in lab test tubes to draft new identities and memories. Proyas and his scenarists cannot figure out whether audiences should like or loathe him. Proyas generates an air of mystery, but this genre has been so overdone that 'Dark City' illuminates nothing more than its own shortcomings. If Dungeons and Dragons entertain you, 'Dark City' may mesmerize you.",4,31,57,16 November 2008
Dunkirk," Humdrum World War II Heroics
","Traditional armchair generals should know that director Christopher Nolan's World War II epic 'Dunkirk' has little to do with the battle of Dunkirk. You won't see German Panzer Corps careening through Belgium and bulldozing into France. In fact, the only Germans in 'Dunkirk' are either flying planes or show up as foot soldiers from undetermined units. Basically, 'Dunkirk' breaks the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces (B.E.F.) up into three sections: one on land that covers one week, one on sea that covers one day, and one in the air that covers one hour. Of course, much, much, more occurred at Dunkirk than just the massive evacuation. Presumably, the 'Dark Knight' filmmaker did not want to overextend himself a standard-issue battle extravaganza. 'Dunkirk' was produced for $100-million, with probably millions more for simply publicity. So, if you're looking for something like 'The Longest Day' (1962), 'Battle of the Bulge' (1965), 'Anzio' (1968), 'A Bridge Too Far' (1977), 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), and 'Hacksaw Ridge' (2016), prepare to be disappointed. 'Dunkirk' doesn't recreate historic battlefield firefights, not even the infamous Wormhoudt Massacre where Waffen-SS soldiers of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler slaughtered as many as 80 British soldiers along with some French POWs. The SS crowded their prisoners into a stable, tossed in stick-grenades, and then finished them off with bursts of machine gun fire. Something like this might have given 'Dunkirk' greater dramatic gravity. Instead, we see neither German tanks nor troops storming through France and Belgium like devils. This 107-minute movie boils down to a series of survival episodes that occurred strictly at Dunkirk. Notably, the RAF preferred to confine their resources largely to the island in preparation for the inevitable Battle of Britain, later made into the exemplary film the 'Battle of Britain' (1969). Aside from the RAF, the Royal Navy and the Small Boat Owners are the heroes who rescued the BEF waiting impatiently on the beach.'Dunkirk' opens with several British infantrymen wandering down a road inside the Dunkirk city limits as the Luftwaffe drops propaganda leaflets. No sooner have they had a moment to glance these surrender summons than gunfire breaks out from an unknown source. As they scramble for cover, unseen shooters kill all except Tommy (newcomer Fionn Whitehead), who crosses a street and comes under fire from French troops. They wave him toward their lines, and later he saunters onto the beaches. As far as he can see, queues of troops are standing on the beach awaiting transport. 'Spectre' lenser Hoyte Van Hoytema's atmospheric cinematography shows these soldiers in their brown uniforms standing like sitting ducks in a row on white beaches. These scenes resemble something out of 'Lawrence of Arabia' in all their sprawling immensity. Indeed, Van Hoytema's cinematography adds to the spectacle. Not long afterward, as Tommy tours the beach, screaming Stuka dive-bombers plunge from the skies like murderous seagulls on a beach teeming with baby turtles and do similar damage on a grand scale. The worst death in 'Dunkirk' happens when bombs create marching explosions that blast a British soldier to smithereens as he shoots at the plane. Tommy meets another soldier under mysterious circumstances on the beach. Might he be a German saboteur? Without challenging him about his odd behavior, Tommy pitches in to help. They become fast friends who try to break the rules and the lines so they can get aboard a transport. Cheekily, they seize a stretcher case awaiting transport and scramble to an embarkation station. They reach the ship at the last minute, but they are denied access because they were Red Cross personnel. Nolan has these two heading off to find passage elsewhere by other means. Their exploits turn into shenanigans as they confront one setback after another, even after they get aboard a ship.Although the RAF lost fewer planes than the Luftwaffe: 145 to 156, 'Dunkirk' shows no more than six Spitfire fighters cruising the English Channel in search of prey. Again, budgetary concerns may explain the aircraft shortages. Also, Nolan doesn't go for too much CGI, so he resorted to cardboard cutouts of troops on the beach. Nevertheless, we get one hour's worth of the RAF giving the Luftwaffe literal Hell. Predictably, one pilot perishes in a crash, another ditches in the sea, but the third is far more fortunate. RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy of 'Mad Max: Fury Road') shoots up the Luftwaffe in 'Dunkirk's' most exciting scenes. Christopher Nolan does a decent job of staging several tense scenes of soldiers confronting catastrophe. Unfortunately, aside from Tom Hardy's RAF pilot, Kenneth Branagh's Naval officer (who never endangered), Mark Rylance as a civilian sailor, and Cillian Murphy as the shell-shocked soldier, no celebrity movie stars of prominence. Indeed, most of the actors are unknown, except perhaps for 'One-Direction' singer Harry Styles. Suspense works best when a character is conspicuous enough either as an actor or a character for us to care about. Everybody is virtually a nobody in 'Dunkirk.' Meantime, evoking sympathy for soldiers so desperate that they take refuge in a beached ship and become targets seems like the province of a horror chiller. Quoting the cliché, they die like fish in a barrel during target practice. Indeed, two soldiers trapped in the boat are the same who have tried to board transports. Oscar winning actor Mark Rylance has one of the better roles as a small boat owner who has already lost a son in the RAF. The episode with the shell-shocked soldier involving the inconsequential treatment of a civilian teen is the least savory scene. Nevertheless, Rylance's character is never in jeopardy. Often wearing an aviator's oxygen mask, Tom Hardy looks like the villainous Bane from Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises,' but he comes closest to being a blood and guts hero. Ultimately, despite its heartfelt tribute to British resiliency in the face of annihilation, 'Dunkirk' qualifies as a routine war movie.",5,10,21,25 July 2017
Bad Teacher," Easy F
","Talk about a waste of time and talent! 'Walk Hard' director Jake Kasdan has fashioned a predictable, 89-minute, R-rated comedy that takes few risks and breaks no new ground. The pathetic, lowest-common-denominator humor struggles to qualify as raunchy, but it all looks like bits and pieces that wound up on the cutting room floor for the hilarious Billy Bob Thornton epic 'Bad Santa.' No, nobody who worked on 'Bad Santa' had anything to do with this uninspired, low-life laffer boasting consistently obnoxious characters. Sure, our blond, bombshell heroine spouts profanity, smokes marijuana, and has promiscuous sex with single guys. So what! Most of this borderline bad behavior that would appeal to underage urchins giggling gleefully as they inhale their first puffs from a cigarette butt and ogle a Maxim magazine. 'Bad Teacher' isn't 'bad' based on what the characters do. Now, had our heroine had gone to bed with one of her seventh graders, indulged in sex with either another woman or a midget, and manufactured meth, then she would have emerged as a 'bad' teacher. The son of writer & director Lawrence Kasdan who made 'The Big Chill,' 'Wyatt Earp,' and 'Silverado,' Jake Kasdan has only helmed one memorable film, the crudely subversive musical-comedy spoof 'Walk Hard.' Everything else that he has made ranks at best as fair to middling fare. The only thing worth looking at in 'Bad Teacher' is Cameron Diaz. Indeed, the 38-year old actress looks sexy when she sponges down cars with her body, slinks around in skimpy outfits like a tramp, and swears like a sailor, but 'Bad Teacher' cannot compare with something really funny like the Farrelly Brothers' comedy 'There's Something about Mary.' 'Bad Teacher' is neither as entertaining as her earlier sci-fi outing 'The Box' or the melodramatic 'My Sister's Keeper.'The bare-bones plot concerns an Illinois middle-school teacher, Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), who wouldn't last thirty seconds in an actual class room. Elizabeth is an abrasive, self-centered, gold-digger. She had been planning to marry a wealthy guy, Mark (Nat Faxon of 'Beerfest') until his protective mother convinces him that Elizabeth only wants his loot. She accuses Elizabeth of being so oblivious to her son that she does not even know when Mark's birthday is. Distraught over this debacle, our heroine heads back to the class room. Earlier, her colleagues had given Elizabeth a big-send off with a Boston Market gift card. When she is in the class room, Elizabeth's ideas about pedagogy consist primarily of showing her students movies on DVD such as 'Stand and Deliver,' 'Dangerous Minds,' and 'Lean on Me.' Meantime, Elizabeth sits at her desk and either sleeps or looks at breast implant literature! She doesn't particularly like the hopelessly chipper teacher across the hall, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch of 'Dinner for Schmucks'), because Amy lives and breathes to teach middle school. Indeed, Amy is somewhat anal about following rules! Indeed, Amy is appalled that Elizabeth is relying on DVDs this early in the semester.No sooner has the semester started than the school acquires a new teacher, Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake of 'Get Smart'), who Elizabeth stoops to conquer, except that she has to tangle with cheerful Amy to land him. Marking time in the wings for Elizabeth is the only remotely sympathetic character, middle school gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'), who doesn't get her attention until the last quarter-hour of the action. Actually, the amiable Russell shares more in common with Elizabeth than any of her other colleagues. Russell puffs pot and displays a cynicism that reflects Elizabeth's own. Anyhow, our calculating heroine figures that the only way that she can get Scott is to have her breasts enlarged. Talk about cynicism! A scene with a plastic surgeon, Doctor Vogel (David Paymer of 'Redbelt') and one of his boob job models at his clinic is about as sleazy as this saga gets. Elizabeth drools at the sight of those big knockers and fantasizes about the possibilities that they offer. Imagine her distress when she winds up in bed with Scott and all they do is dry-hump, and then we are shown an obvious semen stain on his jeans. Anybody who grimaces at this behavior has clearly led a cloistered life where sleazy movies are concerned. After our heroine gets the idea to orchestrate a car wash where she uses her body as a sponge to wash the vehicles and then pockets the proceeds, Elizabeth drums up the balance of her bread for a breast job by stealing the answers to a Standardized test. Elizabeth puts on a red 'Annie' wig, masquerades as a journalist, and seduces a timid educator, Carl Halabi (Thomas Lennon of 'Reno 911: Miami'), and then slips a roofie in his drink. Again, as thoroughly objectionable and unethical as her behavior is, it is nothing new in a movie. Had Elizabeth found herself opposite a lusty lesbian educator, then that might have been a little closer to the borderline. Nothing that Elizabeth does amounts to a challenge her to her skills or her taste. Surprisingly, Timberlake plays his preppy, be-spectacled school teacher as if he were a closeted homosexual. Of course, Cameron Diaz is largely trading on her spectacular looks, but even she is looks a little bewildered playing such an inadequately drawn character. You don't really hate her and you don't really admire her. Nobody takes advantage of her and Diaz never musters any charisma as a 'bad' girl. If you are looking for something like 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off,' 'Mr. Woodcock,' or 'School of Rock,' you won't find it in 'Bad Teacher.' Altogether, 'Bad Teacher' is not bad, mostly tame. This amoral lesson in life deserves a grade of F for forgettable!",1,16,32,26 June 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Dark Spider Rises
","Sony Pictures has ignored the old adage: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Five years ago, the studio canceled the fourth installment in the Toby Maguire 'Spider-man' franchise with original director Sam Raimi at the helm. Sony cited escalating production costs as justification for abandoning the series. Now, not only has Sony rebooted it with a different director and a different pair of leads, but also the studio has retooled it with a darker screenplay. You could call it 'The Dark Spider Arises' because the filmmakers are channeling 'Batman' in this entry. Unfortunately, 'The Amazing Spider-man' isn't as amazing as the original 'Spider-man.' '(5oo) Days of Summer' director Marc Webb struggles with two problems: a lackluster villain straight out of a bad B-movie chiller and a drawn-out running time. Essentially, 'The Losers' scenarist James Vanderbilt, original 'Spider-man 2' scribe Alvin Sargent, and 'Harry Potter' penman Steve Kloves have kept intact most of the best parts of the original. Dare they depart from the canon? Happily, they've have retained the radioactive spider bite, the confrontation with obnoxious Flash, and the marvelous web-slinging training sequences. Webb and his writers have put into effect some interesting changes. Ostensibly, except for a single close-up on a stack of newspapers, they have omitted the Daily Bugle newspaper. This time around they show Uncle Ben's murder in graphic detail, an event that occurred off-screen in the original. Further, they have made the heroic Peter Parker a lot smarter than he was in Toby Maguire's incarnation. Along the way they have forged a few surprises, particularly with Peter's other romantic interest; Gwen Stacy has replaced Mary Jane Watson. Peter contends with new antagonists both natural and supernatural. The most prominent villain is Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), while the second is Gwen's father, New York Police Department Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who abhors vigilante interlopers and has nothing but contempt for Spidey. Unfortunately, the film stretches itself perilously thin in the final quarter hour into a 136 minute running time. Actor Rhys Ifans' maimed scientist villain is seamlessly mutated into a giant green lizard, but he lacks half of the ferocity that Maguire's adversaries provided him with in director Sam Raimi's trilogy. The Green Goblin was a lively, audacious adversary, but The Lizard is rather dreary. The special effects are terrific as is the cinematography. Although he is 28 years old, British actor Andrew Garfield looks more believable as a skinny teenager than Toby Maguire. Indeed, he would be fantastic as Norman Bates if Hollywood ever reboots the Hitchcock classic. Several scenes stand out in 'The Amazing Spider-Man.' The scene on the Williamsburg Bridge when Connors mutates into the Lizard is one of the best, with the nimble Spidey compelled to save multiple characters. The most memorable is a little boy stuck in an SUV. What makes this instance so significant is that our hero identifies himself as Spider-Man to a grateful father (C. Thomas Howell) after he has rescued his son. When our hero rushes off to warn Captain Stacy about the malicious machinations of Dr. Connors, Stacy reacts with disbelief because Connors is Gwen's mentor. The scene where Spidey tests his new found abilities to leap and lung is reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's dance antics in the original 'Footloose.'Martin Sheen is good as Peter's uncle, but he cannot eclipse Cliff Robertson in the Tobey Maguire origin. Gwen learns about Peter's alter-ego Spider-Man when he shows up battered at her room in a New York high-rise apartment. The chief difference here between the Tobey Maguire 'Spider-Man' and Garfield's is that Gwen and he don't kiss with our hero dangling upside-down. One of my chief complaints about this slick reboot is the scene between Peter Parker and Flash. After Peter acquires his mysterious powers at Oscorp, he humiliates Flash on the basketball court and is summoned to the principal's office. Later, Uncle Ben reprimands our hero for wanting a little payback. Stan Lee shows up for his usual cameo. This time around he is in the high school library wearing head phones while the Lizard and Spidey tangle with each other.",7,2,5,10 July 2012
The Fast and the Furious," Fast, Furious But Formulaic!
","Not surprisingly, plot takes a back seat to action in 'Dragonheart' director Rob Cohen's 'The Fast and the Furious,' with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker, and Matt Schulze. This cinematically souped-up, hot rod retread of 'Point Break' (1987) with illegal street racing instead of skydiving and surfing qualifies as an entertaining but amoral thriller with enough action to satisfy the most attention-deficit viewer.A white LAPD rookie cop who wants a detective's shield goes undercover in to crack down on a ring of daredevil truck hijackers. Gritty performances from a credible ensemble cast topped off with gripping, high-velocity races that smoke 'Gone in 60 Seconds' and 'Driven' offset this fast-paced but formulaic anthology of clichés that masquerades as a plot. Once upon a time, Hollywood designed movies as morality plays, rewarding good and punishing evil. Those conventional rules no longer apply in our enlightened liberal 21st century. Nowadays, villains stand a better-than-average chance of escaping the consequences of their skullduggery.At least, 'The Fast and the Furious' differs from the usual summer tripe, because it ushers audiences into another world where rival Los Angeles youth gangs race nitrous oxide-powered illegal street roadsters with computer-controlled fuel injection systems. Scenarists Gary Scott Thompson of 'Hollow Man,' freshman writer Erick Bergquist, John Pogue of 'U.S. Marshals,' and David Ayer of 'U-571' based their preposterous but unpredictable screenplay on Ken Li's 'Vibe' magazine article.The twentysomething protagonists in 'The Fast and the Furious' go to elaborate lengths to close down quarter-mile stretches of roads to drag race in the nocturnal urban landscape. They post sentinels to monitor the local authorities on scanners so that they can evade detection from the police and drive like hellions. Indeed, this kind of thing really happens. Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (brawny Vin Diesel of 'Saving Private Ryan') reigns as the underworld king of dragsters. 'I live my life a quarter-mile at a time,' this hard-bitten, existential felon confides in Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of 'The Skulls'), 'and for those ten seconds, I'm free.' Brian races against Dom, but he loses. Later, he rescues Dom conveniently when the LAPD arrests fleeing hot rodders from a drag race. Luckily, our hero finds himself on the inside track with the suspects. Dom's childhood buddy Vince (Matt Schulze of 'Blade') accuses Brian of being a cop. When Dom asks Brian, our hero deftly sidesteps the question. No sooner has Brian ingratiated himself with Dom than he finds himself infatuated with the prime suspect's sexy kid sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of 'The Faculty') and plumbs her for information. Eventually, Mia breaks down and fesses up to Brian, but not before the villains stage one final hijacking. Brian and Mia race off to stop them before it is too late.Americans worship rebels, and these charismatic hot rodders attain larger-than-life, heroic stature in 'The Fast and the Furious.' Not only does this actioneer deliberately flaunt the law with an out-of-the-blue surprise ending, but the filmmakers also invite negative charges for glorifying the reckless shenanigans of their ultra-cool, anti-establishment dragsters. The chief offending scene depicts a dangerous game of chicken between the hero and villain to see who can beat a train across an intersection and survive.Altogether, the testosterone-fueled, adrenaline-laced races make 'The Fast and the Furious' worth strapping yourself in for if your summer appears to be heading for the doldrums. The sequels '2 Fast 2 Furious' and 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift' were average, but the protagonists from the original would not regroup until 2009's third sequel 'Fast and Furious' with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker working hand in hand to bust a notorious drug dealer. The special effects shots when the car engines receive their jolts of nitrous oxide are imaginative. Brian O'Connor's boss is played by none other than 'Silence of the Lambs' serial killer Ted Levine. Director Rob Cohen has a cameo as a pizza delivery driver and producer Neal H. Moritz cruises through one scene in a Ferrari.",8,1,3,24 April 2009
Now You See Me," Worth Seeing More Than Once!!!
","Some movies ought to be watched more than once. The latest example is 'Now You See Me' with Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman. 'Now You See Me' amounts to a good magic act. You think you see everything that you need to see, but you actually don't. The narrator/hero J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) summarizes this ideology. 'The closer you think you are,' Atlas claims, 'the less you'll actually see.' His second, relevant line is: 'The more you look, the less you see.' Without veiling my critical opinion of 'Now You See Me' in literary lingo, let me say I enjoyed it enough to watch it twice. The first time I saw everything. The second time I understood everything. Some may put off a second viewing until Red Box rents copies, while others may stand in line the following day. Nevertheless, 'Now You See Me' is rare because it makes you want to watch it again. Like any good magic act, this glossy melodrama manages to keep you distracted for many of its fleet-footed 115 minutes. 'Now You See Me' deserves at least one star for not taking more than two hours to cap off its plot with a sensational finale. Meantime, 'Clash of the Titans' director Louis Leterrier keeps everything both audacious as well as spontaneous. He relies on Steadicams so co-lensers Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong can together make the world of illusion whirl before our eyes as much to induce vertigo as to keep us anxious. Surprises and reversals occur almost every quarter hour to keep you on your toes. Honestly, I saw through at least half of this flashy gibberish, but I couldn't figure out the cloaked identity of the enigmatic individual behind a hood. Indeed, everything else about 'Now You See Me' is first-class from the charismatic cast to the splashy CGI-special effects. This movie is as much fun to watch for its immediate gratification as well as its lasting gratification.A quartet of magicians known only as the Four Horsemen forms a heroic group of protagonists in 'Now You See Me.' Arrogant J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg of 'The Social Network') specializes in sleight of hand antics. As a David Blaine style street magician, he is a pretty sharp card sharp. Sexy Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher of 'Wedding Crashers') tantalizes audiences with her Houdini-like feats of escapism under extreme conditions. She must unlock the shackles confining herself to a glass box before a school of Piranha fish are dumped atop her. Hypnotist/mentalist Merritt (Woody Harrelson of 'Zombieland') uses his cerebral powers to divine the thoughts of others. Finally, Jack (Dave Franco of 'Fright Night') employs his talents as a pickpocket, a card thrower, and safe cracker. Each of these characters appears in an introductory vignette before they are assembled by an unknown leader under extremely cryptic circumstances as a team. They open their magic act at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. They announce they are going to stage a bank robbery. As a part of their show-stopping antics, the Four Horsemen teleport a random audience member (Jose Garcia) from Sin City to his bank vault in Paris. Right before the audience's eyes, the guy attaches a bizarre-looking contraption to his head and vanishes in front of everybody. A moment later, he finds himself inside his bank vault. Millions of Euros in the City of Lights vanish, and the Horsemen find themselves in FBI custody for theft. Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo of 'The Avengers') questions them with the help of French Interpol detective Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent of 'Inglorious Basterds'), but they cannot make their charges stick. Initially, Rhodes and Dray don't cooperate with one another. Their approach to solving crimes differs as much as their attitudes toward each other. Miraculously, the Four Horsemen always manage to stay a couple of jumps ahead of them. Gigantic mirrors, holograms, doubles, hypnosis, and profuse quantities of flash paper constitute most of their magic arsenal. While the cops are pursuing our heroes, an ex-magician, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman of 'The Dark Knight'), who has acquired a reputation for debunking magicians, decides to join the authorities.'Now You See Me' shares a lot in common with the Michael Douglas movie 'The Game' (1997) as well as the Kevin Spacey nail-biter 'The Usual Suspects.' Consequently, even if you can keep up with this snappy saga, you may still stumble when you guess the identity of the character behind the hood. Clearly, either Leterrier or scenarists Ed Solomon of 'Bill & Ted' fame, 'Prince of Persia's' Boaz Yakin, and rookie writer Edward Ricourt, or all, have read Agatha Christie. Agatha Christie plotting is the key to this intriguing mystery. Parisian-born Louis Leterrier learned the logistics of filmmaking as a director under the tutelage of French writer & producer Luc Besson with the first two Jason Statham 'Transporter' thrillers. Leterrier also helmed the Jet Li crime thriller 'Unleashed,' a movie with a happy confluence of charismatic characters and a rewarding finale. Leterrier's reboot of the Marvel Comics mutant superhero character 'The Incredible Hulk' with Edward Norton as the eponymous hero caught more of the spirit of the comic book than Asian helmer Ang Lee's tragic 'Hulk' (2003) with Eric Bana as the big, green guy. Leterrier went from comic book superheroes to mythological Greeks in 'Clash of the Titans.' This outlandish but adolescent sword and sandal opus with Sam Worthington furnished the requisite number of cliffhanger predicaments. Leterrier hasn't made a bad movie, but 'Titans' wasn't as satisfying as the 1981 original with Harry Hamlin. Although 'Now You See Me' careens through a labyrinth with a time limit, the characters emerge as an appealing group so you are rooting for them from the start, even when they have no business surviving some of the disasters that they survive. You can never really believe what your eyes are seeing in 'Now You See Me,' but you'll have a blast watching it.",9,0,6,16 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The Best of the X-Men Movies
","'X-Men' director Bryan Singer finally returned to the fold to helm Twentieth Century Fox's fourth entry 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' with the youngsters from 'X-Men: First Class' prequel intermingling with original cast members. Indeed, this X-Men sequel relies on the plot gimmick that distinguished the first two 'Terminator' movies when the rebels dispatched somebody from the future to plunge back into the past to thwart Skynet's efforts to triumph over humanity. Naturally, it is fantastic to see Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, and Halle Berry sharing the screen with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbinder respectively as Professor X and Magneto. When the action opens, Earth is a ravaged battlefield where Sentinels destroy every mutant that they can target. Lately, they have been targeting normal humans who may give birth to mutated humans. Singer and 'Elysium' scenarist Simon Kinberg drew inspiration from the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline 'Days of Future Past' written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. This 'X-Men' movie qualifies as one of the best, if not the best, in the Marvel Comics' franchise.",10,0,1,10 May 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel Stalemate Saga
","Walt Disney Studios should have changed the title from 'Captain America: Civil War' to 'Captain America: Stalemate' since none of the heroes who square off against each other die. Co-directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who helmed 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' have the two rival divisions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, knocking the shenanigans out of each other in this contrived, drawn-out, 147 minute epic. Nevertheless, the worst thing that happens is War Machine loses control of his Iron Man style armored suit and makes a crash landing in a field. Although he suffers spinal damage, Lieutenant James Rhodes is back up and walking around with some difficulty before fade0ut. Mind you, 'Captain America: Civil War' amounts to a letdown when nobody puts anybody down permanently. Ultimately, the two fractions emerge evenly matched. Nobody like S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson is around to die and make an impact like in 'Marvel's 'The Avengers' (2012). At least the recent DC Comics movie 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' pretended to kill off one of the two title characters. Of course, anybody with a grain of sense knows that the adversary that perished in 'Batman v Superman' isn't dead. Furthermore, the DC Comics extravaganza at least staged a funeral and the characters engaged in a period of mourning. Although the premise that Captain America and Iron Man would clash is certainly attention-grabbing, the movie pulls its punches because the superheroes emerge with little more than either bruises on themselves or scratches on their respective outfits. Despite several competently orchestrated physical confrontations, 'Captain America: Civil War' rarely generates a modicum of suspense about its outcome. Basically, the Russo brothers stage one memorable fight at an evacuated airport, clear up the mystery behind the death of Tony Stark's parents, and introduce a new costume-clad character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Black Panther makes his debut, but he seems rather tame compared with the other Marvel champs. At one point, 'Captain America: Civil War' seems more interested in rebooting the Spider-Man franchise than doing something with its protagonists that its PG-13 rating would condone. Sadly enough, the characters that stand out here aren't the title characters. Indeed, Spider-Man and Ant Man make a greater impression than any of the other Marvel titans, and Black Panther looks like Mardi Gras was his destination, and he paused to participate.Approximately three characters die in 'Captain America: Civil War.' United at the outset, our heroes descend upon Lagos and tangle with former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Brock Rumlow, (Frank Grillo of 'The Purge: Anarchy') a.k.a. Crossbones and his thugs who want to hijack a deadly biological weapon. Crossbones tries to kill Captain America with an explosion that obliterates his own life. Miraculously, the telekinetic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen of 'Godzilla') contains the blast and shifts it elsewhere to do its harm. Unfortunately, the blast shatters a nearby building, killing many unseen, innocent bystanders. The collateral damage fallout from the incident brings the Avengers under scrutiny. Afflicted with a guilty conscience about the death of an African-American lad in Logas, Tony Stark advocates the Sokovia Accords drawn up by the United Nations. Essentially, the Sokovia Accords establishes a panel to supervise the Avengers. Apparently, the indestructible Avengers may be responsible for killing more people than their own adversaries owing to the collateral damage that they have wrought during their escapades. Captain America (Chris Evans of 'The Fantastic Four') abhors the idea, and he refuses to ink the pact. The death of Agent Peggy Carter solidifies his negative attitude toward the Sokovia Accords. A longtime Avengers adversary, U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt of 'Dark City') now enjoys a position with more prestige than power over them. Ross, you may recall, has been the bane of the Hulk. Matters grow even more serious. Steve Rogers' World War II pal Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan of Captain America: The Winter Soldier') is suspected of a igniting a deadly blast in Vienna where the Accords were being signed. Surveillance cameras show that Bucky was in town when the incident occurred. The blast kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda (John Kani of 'The Wild Geese'), and his acrobatic son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman of '42') dons a black bulletproof suit, a mask with cat ears, and gloves with retractable claws and embarks as The Black Panther to avenge his father's death. One of the many problems with 'Captain America: Civil War' is that it bristles with far too many characters who do far too little to each other. Eventually, T'Challa will have his own stand alone movie, but he looks shoehorned into this film with nothing memorable to do. Worst of all, the chief villain is a family-guy-turned-vigilante, Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl of 'Rush'), who is a rather dreary fellow compared with previous Marvel antagonists.Anybody familiar with the Marvel Comics graphic novel will tell you 'Captain America' scenarists Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely have taken liberties with the source material. In the Mark Millar graphic novel, lesser costume clad warriors destroyed an elementary school while a reality-TV crew photographed their endeavors. This wholesale destruction prompted the President of the United States to enact the Superhero Registration Act to make superheroes more accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the law required these costume-clad crusaders to divulge their true identities. Now, these heroes face the prospect of serving as Federal employees or facing arrest. Iron Man supports the act. 'Becoming public employees makes perfect sense,' he proclaims, 'if it helps people sleep a little easier.' Captain America opposes it, 'Super heroes need to stay above that stuff or Washington starts telling us who the super-villains are.' Later, Iron Man tricks Captain America and his Secret Avengers into responding to a fire at petrochemical plant where hundreds people could die. Ultimately, Captain America surrenders after Iron Man beats him into submission.'Captain America: Civil War' isn't half as good as the previous two 'Avengers' movies.",5,13,26,28 May 2016
Saw III," Where Do The 'Saw' Movies Go From Here?
","The new horror chiller 'Saw III' wraps up the bone-grinding, blood-sodden, Grand Guignol torture trilogy with an unimaginative, convoluted ending that suggests mankind prefers to kill rather than forgive each other for their crimes. The original 'Saw' (2004) qualified as a provocative but unsavory white-knuckled exercise in surprise, suspense, and sadism that established new standards for fright films. Its clever but lackluster sequel 'Saw II' (2005) degenerated into a stylistic but repetitious drill in suspense and sadism with more sophisticated deathtraps minus the visceral quality of its brilliant predecessor. 'Saw III' sinks far lower than 'Saw II' in its pretentious commentary about mankind's murderous penchant for mayhem. The latest installment literally scrapes the bottom of the barrel in a slaughterhouse of stellar special effects that don't so much frighten as sicken. Mind you, if the sight of a man trapped at the bottom of a giant vat as the ground-up, liquidified remains of maggot-infested pigs nearly drowns him strikes you as amusing, then you'll crave this obnoxious, nihilistic, below-average sequel. Unhappily, those who demand interesting characters and/or victims, intriguing plot twists and turns, and an ending that delivers a slam-bang, up-beat send-off will condemn 'Saw III' as both predictable and pedestrian. Worse, if you missed the first two 'Saw' movies, a lot of the storyline—several flashbacks about the first two films—may strike you as incomprehensible.Scenarists Leigh Whannell and James Wan, who co-scripted 'Saw,' have written an elaborate morality tale about the futility of revenge. Not only is the notorious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing lethal games with a fresh batch of hapless victims but also he is testing his homicidal apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith of TV's 'Becker') who wants to carry on his serial slaughtering ways. The plot whirls on where 'Saw II' shut off. Ex-junkie Amanda dons a dead pig's head and kidnaps all the cops from the first sequel and sticks them in various bondage contraptions designed to kill them. Again, if you skipped the first two 'Saw' sagas, most of these early scenes will baffle you. Of course, coherence and credibility aren't important where most horror movies are concerned. Horror movies are designed to make you scream, and the torture devices that Amanda claps these poor slobs into will make you shutter at her callous disregard for life. For example, the corrupt, evidence-planting 'Saw II' cop finds himself shackled by the leg and left to die in the same grungy toilet from the first movie. Instead of cutting off his ankle with a rusty hacksaw, he smashes his foot so thoroughly that he can slip the mangled remains out of the shackle. Afterward, things get progressively worse or, depending on your repressed sadomasochistic tendencies, progressively better.In 'Saw II,' the anti-heroic Jigsaw was in bad shape as a result of his inoperable cancer. In 'Saw III,' he spends the entire movie on his death bed and suffers from horrible headaches. He dispatches Amanda to kidnap an emergency room surgeon, Lynn (Bahar Soomekh of 'Mission Impossible 3'), to relieve his headaches by boring holes into his skull. Mind you, it isn't important that anybody could survive this kind of surgery and still be as fiendishly clear-minded as Jigsaw is. Of course, poor Lynn finds herself in the unenviable position of performing surgery with a steel collar encircling her neck. Amanda has designed Lynn's noxious necklace of sorts and equipped it with firing mechanisms loaded with .12 gauge shotgun shells. If Lynn errs during her operation on Jigsaw, the killer's life-support systems will trigger those devices, blowing the surgeon's brains to bits. Meanwhile, Amanda has abducted another unfortunate character, Jeff (Angus Macfayden of 'Braveheart'), who has been suffering ever since a motorist killed his son. Jeff has neither recovered from his grief over his son's accidental death nor his contempt for a legal system that let his son's killer off with a light sentence. None of the unredeemable characters in 'Saw III' learn the lesson that it is better to forgive and forget rather than destroy.The violence is 'Saw III' surpasses anything from the earlier 'Saw' movies. In fact, it makes 'Hostel' look like child's play. Unlike 'Hostel,' however, nobody survives 'Saw III.' Sophomore director Darren Lynn Bousman, who helmed 'Saw II,' and Kevin Greutert, the editor on all three 'Saw' films, display their technical mastery for staging brutal scenes and condensing details. Indeed, 'Saw III' benefits from top-notch production values and superb visual blood and gore effects. Although it is a malevolent, raw-edged crime/ horror thriller with virtually no redeeming thematic value, the filmmakers have done a brilliant job of showing us some frankly far-fetched stuff. The scene where Lynn removes a chunk of Jigsaw's cranium with power tools stolen straight out of Bob Villa's home repair workshop is an assault on both the eyes and the ears.Ironically, the people who wrote and directed this devastatingly mean-spirited melodrama appear to have carved themselves into a corner. Although they were able to create a sequel to the original film and its initial sequel, the chances of a sequel to 'Saw III' look pretty remote. The 'Saw' movies have never been about the supernatural thrills and chills, like either the 'Friday the 13th' or 'Halloween' flicks, so it will be interesting to see how they will contrive 'Saw IV?'",2,1,2,13 June 2007
Duck You Sucker," Sergio Leone & The Mexican Revolution
","Sergio Leone wanted his protégé Giancarlo Santi to direct the Rod Steiger & James Coburn epic 'Duck You Sucker' while he served in a supervisory role as an executive producer. Things changed when the two stars insisted that Leone take over the helm. Santi wound up handling the second unit work, while Leone handled Steiger and Coburn. 'Duck You Sucker' pales by comparison with Sergio Leone's earlier masterpiece 'Once Upon a Time in the West.' Indeed, the picture lacks the charisma of Leone's period 'Dollar' westerns with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. This tale about the Mexican revolution appeared at a time when Spaghetti westerns were declining in numbers. Some directors already were exploring political themes within the framework of the Mexican revolution. Simultaneously, American westerns were forging on to the turn of the century so the hardware that the heroes and villains used seemed modern by comparison. Automatic pistols replaced revolvers. After he helmed 'A Fistful of Dollars,' 'For A Few Dollars More,' 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' Leone had done everything he had wanted to do with the western. Early foreign westerns imitated American westerns until Leone revolutionized the genre with his bounty hunter trilogy. Everybody imitated Leone. Later, he would return briefly to the western genre with two Terence Hill comedies. Essentially, the Leone who had created the Spaghetti western as we know it, faded into the background with 'Duck You Sucker.' In many ways, this spectacular looking adventure movie shows a Leone of greater maturity. Nevertheless, he didn't personalize the mise-en-scene of the Zapata movies as he had done with period Spaghetti westerns. Directors Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima emerged as the foremost practitioners of the Zapata westerns respectively with 'The Mercenary' and 'The Big Gundown.' Furthermore, Leone was moving away from his carefree but violent movies. The protagonists in 'Duck You Sucker' are a disillusioned IRA gunman on the lam and a Mexican bandit who cares nothing for the revolution until he winds up being a part of it. The friendship between these two men that dominates the sprawling action is deeper than that between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in 'For a Few Dollars More.' The themes of death, betrayal, revenge, and commitment recur throughout this lengthy adventure movie. The initial showdown between Juan (Rode Steiger) and Sean (James Coburn) when they meet in the desert is pure Leone. Indeed, while it isn't as much fun as his previous westerns, 'Duck You Sucker' contains scenes that recurred throughout his earlier films. Flashbacks play an important role here as it did in 'For A Few Dollars More.' Railroads are featured prominently in the action. Everything is big. Sean blows up a building and literally brings the entire structure down. The end gambit when two trains collide head on in the desert is the heart of spectacle itself. Juan is a bandit with a large family of armed and deadly sons. Juan dreams of robbing a legendary bank in Mesa Verde. When he finally gets around to it, Juan is fooled by Sean and the revolutionaries. All the loot has been moved and all Juan can find is political prisoners that he liberates and winds up being a champion of the revolution. However, Juan hates revolutions. Gradually, the disillusioned Sean comes around to Juan's point of view while he is struggling to work out a predicament that occurred in Ireland. Sean's friend (David Warbeck) betrays him to the authorities. When police come looking for Sean, Sean is prepared. Not only does he shoot both cops, but he also kills his father. Mind you, 'Duck You Sucker' is a brilliant movie, filled with insight, but it shuns being a flippant shoot'em up with no philosophy. Ennio Morricone contributes another memorable scene. The showdown at the bridge in the desert is awesome.",9,1,3,11 September 2013
Tropic Thunder," 'Thunder' Is Wonderful!
","'Reality Bites' director Ben Stiller has not only made a rambunctious R-rated parody of Vietnam war movies with his audacious, big dumb action comedy 'Tropic Thunder,' but he also has ridicules Hollywood's obsession with such fare. Take all the 'Rambo' sagas with Sylvester Stallone and then toss in George Hickenlooper's superlative documentary 'Heart of Darkness' (1991) about the complications that Francis Ford Coppola faced on his magnum opus 'Apocalypse Now,' and you'll have a good idea of what to expect from 'Tropic Thunder.' Although Stiller and his top-notch cast play everything for belly laughs, 'Tropic Thunder' contains moments when it could pass for a genuine, straight-laced adventure outing. 'Iron Man' sensation Robert Downey, Jr., overshadows everybody as five-time Oscar winning Australian actor Kurt Lazarus who has dyed his skin black to play an jive-talking, George Jefferson-type, African-American U.S. Army Sergeant. Superstar Tom Cruise makes quite an impression as a sleazy, gutter-mouthed Tinseltown producer whose favorite word starts with the sixth letter of the alphabet. Matthew McConaughey, Jack Black, Nick Nolte, Tobey Maguire, Mickey Rooney, and young Asian actor Brandon Soo Hoo in a bravura performance as the vilest little villain ever flesh out the cast of this imaginative, memorable, and sometimes controversial insanity.Stiller opens 'Tropic Thunder' with hilarious trailers for fake movies that headline his stars. Stiller plays action hero Tugg Speedman in a series of 'Scorcher' movies that ridicule franchises like Bruce Willis' 'Die Hard,' except that Tugg has run his course as a hero. Robert Downey, Jr., appears alongside 'Spider-Man' star Tobey Maguire as a pair of promiscuous priests at a remote monastery. Jack Black mimics Eddie Murphy's 'The Nutty Professor' movies with his own bowel-humored comedies about an obese family called 'The Fatties.' Black plays each family member in a fat suit and delights in breaking wind at the least provocation. If these faux trailers don't offend you and you find yourself laughing until your sides split, what follows is even funnier. Essentially, 'Tropic Thunder' unfolds as a movie-within-a-movie about Hollywood movie makers. Freshman director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan of 'Night at the Museum') plays a witless helmer who gets dressed down by action movie mogul Len Grossman (Tom Cruise of 'Top Gun') for not having his cameras rolling on a million dollar fireball explosion like the one that ignited 'Apocalypse Now.' Damien wants desperately to redeem himself in Grossman's eyes, and burned-out Vietnam veteran Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte of '48 Hrs') concocts a scheme that will help Damien win back Grossman's support. Ostensibly, Four-Leaf's memoirs inspired Damien's Vietnam extravaganza, and Four Leaf suggests that Damien take his cast into the jungle, rig up surveillance cameras to film them and then turn the guys loose. Not only will Damien be able to shoot the movie guerrilla-style for the least amount of money possible, but he also will get realistic performances from his pampered, soft-living cast. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller of 'Meet the Fockers') likes the idea because he hopes that Damien's Vietnam epic will boost his career out of the doldrums. Earlier, Speedman had starred in a 'Forrest Gump' style movie called 'Simple Jack' where he impersonated a mentally challenged, buck-toothed hayseed who claimed that he could converse with the livestock. 'Simple Jack' crashed and burned at the box office, and Damien's movie represents a reprieve for Speedman's career. No sooner have these nitwits hit the jungle than everything goes haywire. What our heroes have no clue about is that the part of Southeast Asia where they have chosen to film is the bailiwick of ruthless Asian drug producers. A cigar-chomping, 12-old year tyrant, Tran (first-time actor Brandon Soo Hoo), and his heavily armed henchmen operate a secret factory where they manufacture massive quantities of heroin. When Tran's goons spot Tugg and his fellow thespians on cinematic maneuvers, they mistake the stars for the D.E.A. They capture Four Leaf and later Tugg and imprison them, while Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr. of 'Iron Man'), heroin-addicted Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black of 'King Kong') and hip-hop wannabe Alpha Chino (Brandon T. Jackson of 'Roll Bounce') decide to imitate Rambo and spring their comrades.'Tropic Thunder' qualifies as a goofy, gung-ho action comedy until our heroes encounter the villains and their heroin factory. Indeed, Tran and his trigger-happy thugs take themselves seriously. They prefer to shoot first and ask questions afterward. Nevertheless, it seems that these Asians loved Tugg Speedman's portrayal of retarded farmhand Simple Jack, and they coerce him at gun point to perform a one-man version of the movie while our dim-witted heroes plan an attack. Stiller and scenarists Justin 'Strangers with Candy' Theroux and Etan 'King of the Hill' Cohen spare nobody and nothing in their outlandish depiction of Hollywood gone wild. Robert Downey, Jr., and Tom Cruise steal 'Tropic Thunder' with their whacked-out characters, and Cruise skewers his 'Risky Business' origins with a goofy dance as the end credits roll. Be prepared either for the worst or the best of everythingdepending on either your tastefulness or tastelessness with 'Tropic Thunder.'",9,2,6,27 August 2008
Hardball," The people who made 'Hardball' should be shipped back down to the minor league of filmmakers
","Imagine what Hollywood would make if it combined 'The Bad News Bears' with 'Boyz N the Hood?' Or 'The Mighty Ducks' got tight with 'Dangerous Minds?' 'Varsity Blues' director Brian Robbins and 'Summer Catch' scenarist John Gatins cover 'Hardball' with so much sap they should have called it 'Spitball.' This hopelessly derivative and shamelessly schmaltzy sporting fable offers little that hasn't been done better before, aside from its star appearing in such a movie. Hollywood spouts ideological gobbledygook through both dialogue and actions. 'Hardball' rolls back time to the 'white man's burden' problem dramas. I haven't seen anything in the press about Spike Lee's reaction to 'Hardball,' but I'm dying to know about his complaints. 'Hardball' dodges the question why whites are coaching blacks in modern-day American team sports. Is this commentary about the paucity of black role models in contemporary America? 'Hardball' mirrors the 1965 Moynihan report. Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan argued racism prevented African-American men in the ghettos from obtaining good paying jobs. Humiliated because they could not support their families, these men without self-esteem abandoned their role as husbands and/or fathers and fled, leaving their wives an awful burden. 'Hardball' projects this image of African-Americans in Chicago's real-life Cabrini Green, more of a war-zone itself than a housing project. Lacking black father role-models for themselves, a team of foul-mouthed fifth graders bond with an amoral, compulsive gambler who smokes like a chimney, guzzles like a fish, and frequents sports bars. Baseball redeems oddballs in this bummer of a hardboiled sandlot saga. Reportedly, Paramount Pictures slashed the controversial R-rated version of this rough-hewn opus and wound up with a strongly-worded PG-13 rating. Nevertheless, Gatins' heavy-handed, tear jerking morality tale still comes out swinging.Prepare yourself for the worst if you waltz into 'Hardball' hoping for a 'Cosby' sitcom. This cynical, no-holds-barred, saga about social conscientiousness reforms the unsavory Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves of 'The Matrix') after he agrees to coach the KeKambas, an impoverished Chicago Housing Authority Little League baseball club. Conor owes several grand to several bone-crushing thugs when he asks his arrogant stockbroker chum, Jimmy (Mike McGlone of 'The Brothers McMullen'), for a loan. Instead, Jimmy pays Conor $500-a-week to supervise a team of African-American misfits. Conor tutors two of them before their tough-minded Catholic school English teacher Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane of 'The Perfect Storm') lets them suit up. Of course, each character boasts some trait or affliction that sets him aside from the others. A chubby athlete struggles with asthma; one wears glasses; another isn't old enough; and two brawl like bobcats. When Conor stages batting practice, these fifth graders watch the balls either bounce off them or fly past them. They ridicule each other without mercy. Conor cuts out the name calling, and the boys get down to business. Incredibly, KeKambas' pitcher Miles Pennfield II (Alan Ellis, Jr.) emerges as a strike-out ace. The secret of Miles' success is his Walkman and the Notorious B.I.G. tune 'Big Poppa' that he listens to repeatedly and relies on for a sense of rhythm. Eventually, villainous opposing team coach Matt Hyland (D.B. Sweeney of 'The Cutting Edge') forces Miles to remove them, and our hero suffers like Samson with shorn hair. The best example of Hyland's villainy occurs when G-Baby (DeWayne Warren), clearly under age, steps up to the plate for his first time at a crucial point in a game. Sadly, neither Robbins nor Gatins tap Sweeney's obnoxious coach for a greater source of drama. John Gatins' convoluted screenplay consists of two interwoven stories: the plight of the KeKambas and O'Neill's gambling habit. The overnight transformation of the KeKambas when Conor takes them to a ball game is as far-fetched as they are goofy.'Hardball' hurls Keanu Reeves his most unorthodox role. As Conor O'Neill, he incarnates the most credible but contemptible character in his career. 'Hardball' pokes fun at its hero but commendably keeps our anti-hero in peril. Robbins doesn't depict Conor in a complimentary light, until our protagonist undergoes his Biblical Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus conversion and shuns gambling. Conor's transition from sinner to saint is outlandishly melodramatic. Typically derided for giving wooden performances, Keanu Reeves burrows farther into this role than any other.Diane Lane does wonders with her one-dimensional role. Since the kids trust Conor, she warms up to the lout. Robbins, who helmed 'Ready To Rumble,' never lets the Lane & Reeves romance interfere with the action on the field. Their best scene together occurs at school when Conor accuses Elizabeth of liking him. This scene represents one of Keanu Reeves' closest scraps with acting. Pouring out personality, he indulges in elaborate gestures and facial expressions. Lane and he generate a modicum of chemistry, and they make a believable couple. The plot transition that brings them together is too good to be true, so you'll either applaud it or laugh yourself silly about it.Robbins misses more than he hits in 'Hardball' as a director. He makes us aware of social consciousness issues, chiefly the precarious environment where the KeKambas live. Dope-pedaling, trigger-happy gangstas plague the housing project and prey on the kids. Residents huddle on the floor beneath window level for safety's sake. Nevertheless, he fares well with some scenes, especially when asthmatic Jefferson (Julian Griffith) tries to get home after dark and gangstas attack him. This is a pretty chilling scene. Meanwhile, just when Conor believes he is washed up, his luck abruptly changes for the better. Predictably, the KeKambas win the pennant, but not before sudden tragedy of the 'Pay It Forward' variety exerts a terrible toll on them. This is the lowest and wildest pitch Robbins makes in an effort to win us over to this maudlin melodrama. Even if you hate 'Hardball,' as I did, you'll find it difficult to exit with a dry eye.",4,4,10,6 February 2008
The Usual Suspects," An Extraordinary Thriller
","'X-Man' director Bryan Singer and Oscar winning scenarist Christopher McQuarrie surpassed themselves when they concocted 'The Usual Suspects,' one of the best, all-time crime thrillers ever produced. After they are taken into custody by the New York Police Department to appear in a line-up, five criminals conspire together to carry out a couple of high risk heists. Actually, an enigmatic individual has recruited this quintet because each of them has either stolen from or interfered with him. At the heart of this slick but sophisticated thriller is a super criminal named Keyser Soze. Meantime, a dedicated Customs official, Dave Kujan is in hot pursuit of one of these five, a former cop, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) who did time in jail for murdering several people. Initially, Dave (Chazz Palminteri) thought that Keaton was dead when he found him in a restaurant bargaining with two other business men. The other men who spent a time in jail with Keaton are Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Kint (Kevin Spacey), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and McManus (Stephen Baldwin), and before the night is over, they plan to hit an illegal NYPD courier service.",10,1,3,4 March 2015
Die Hard 2," John McClane Versus Django!
","The last time we saw Detective John McClane in 'Die Hard,' he was a member of the New York Police Department. He flew across country to Los Angeles to patch up his marriage to his wife Holly. After single-handedly thwarting a gang of German gunmen, McClane went to work for the Los Angeles Police Department. In 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' our indestructible protagonist finds himself in Washington, D.C., at Dulles International Airport, on Christmas Day. McClane encounters another group of ruthless villains who want to rescue a South America drug dealer when his plane sets down. Literally, these villains hold an airport hostage and make it impossible for any plane to land. 'Cliffhanger' director Renny Harlan delivers some agile violence, and 'Die Hard' scribe Steven E. de Souza and 'Bad Boys' writer Doug Richardson imitate the original. Actually, they do a pretty good job, including giving several characters a chance to encore. Holly plays a bigger role this time around, while the obnoxious reporter that William Atherton plays gets a couple of scenes. If you look closely, you'll spot Robert Patrick of 'Terminator 2,' Colin Meany of 'Star Trek The Next Generation,' and John Leguizamo of 'The Rock.'McClane is the last man that renegade soldier Colonel Stuart (William Sadler of 'The Shawshank Redemption') counted on when he embarked on his next mission. Stuart's dastardly henchmen have hacked into the airport computers and lowered the land strip so when a plane lands, it crashes. Colonel Stuart makes a good villain, and McClane doesn't have an easy job dealing with one disaster after another. In a sense, Stuart is a more dangerous villain than Hans Gruber was because he orders the death of hundreds aboard a Winsdor Airlines jet. John Amos is good as the secondary villain. Initially, I thought 'Die Hard 2' was the worst film of this franchise until I saw 'A Good Day to Die Hard.' Altogether, this 'Die Hard' qualifies as above-average.",8,0,1,15 February 2013
Resident Evil," Underground Zombies Unite
","'Mortal Combat' director Paul W.S. Anderson's first entry in the 'Resident Evil' franchise is basically a low-budget zombie munch-fest based on the popular Capcom video game that spawned the series. This $ 30-million horror chiller relies on several narrative devices to fuel its adrenalin-laced antics. First, the heroine suffers from amnesia as she struggles to remember what she was doing in the ultra-secret, high-tech, subterranean laboratory of the Umbrella Corporation where scientists have been conducting research and development on experimental viruses for military usage. Second, from the moment that the rescue team arrives and collects Alice (Milla Jovovich of 'The Fifth Element'), Matt (Eric Mabius of 'Cruel Intentions'), and Spence (James Purefoy of 'Solomon Kane'), they have an hour to penetrate the Hive, carry out their mission, and exit the complex before it seals itself shut. Third, the entire experience occurs in a claustrophobic setting that accentuates the suspense after our heroes encounter a zombie horde. Everybody earning a paycheck in the Hive dies when a traitor smashes a lethal t-virus container that shuts down the facility and winds up spreading death. Fourth, the ravenous undead are not the only adversaries that our heroes must contend with; zombie Dobermanns threaten them as well as a mysteriously mutated monster with a long, elastic tongue and razor-sharp claws that can penetrate a train. Believe it or not, Anderson displays some discretion in some of the greatest gut-churning scenes. When a group is trapped inside an elevator, one woman squeezes her head through an opening and realizes too late as do her companions that she is going to be decapitated when the elevator goes upward and smashes her head. The audience, especially those that have played the Capcom game, know that you have to put a bullet in a zombie's head to kill it. Unfortunately, our stalwart heroes aren't privy to this life-saving information. Eventually, the supercomputer that regulates the Hive and takes the holographic form of an adolescent female becomes another of our heroes' adversaries.As the plot unfolds, Alice regains her memory in bits and pieces and realizes that she was the individual who had decided to expose the Umbrella Corporation. All of the laboratory technicians in the Hive perish tragically through no fault of their own because one mysterious individual sabotaged the Hive. These employees come back to life as zombies that live only to eat. These zombies are traditional 'Night of the Living Dead' shambling walkers. The close quarters inside the Hive as well as the booby-traps that our heroes must navigate to avoid constitutes a primary form of suspense. At one point, our desperate heroes clamber atop the air condition ducts dangling by wires from the ceiling to escape the zombies milling about beneath them. One of the more memorable scenes takes place before this one when the rescue team arrives in a hallway that has been booby-trapped with the equivalent of a cheese grater made up of lasers to slice up the rescue team as they scramble to avoid them. Our heroine Alice—dressed in a skimpy red dress—contends with hunger Dobermanns in one of the strongest scenes in the film. Just when she thinks that she had taken care of these menacing dogs, she runs into others. Before long, even these canines mutilate undead dogs and attack Milia, but she knows how to contend with them.'Resident Evil' gets the franchise off to a fitting start when our hero arrives by train.",6,1,1,15 October 2016
Quantum of Solace," Nothing About This Bourne-Again Bond Is Breathtaking . . .
","Cobra-faced actor Daniel Craigthe fifth to play James Bondis in better shape than the new 007 epic 'Quantum of Solace.' If the previous Bond outing 'Casino Royale' struck you as abysmal, the threadbare 'Quantum of Solace' scrapes the bottom of the barrel. David Bradley's rough & tumble second-unit action sequences and Simon Crane's stunts provide the only bright spots. Unfortunately, neither Craig's virile 007 nor the gripping fisticuffs can salvage this mundane melodrama that resumes the narrative where 'Casino Royale' left off with Bond confronting one of the villains. Subsequently, if you missed 'Casino Royale,' 'Quantum's' plot convolutions may mystify you. Since Bond producer Cubby Broccoli died, the Bond movies have hit the skids. 'Quantum' is the briefest Bond in history and the least compelling if you're a traditional 007 fan. In fact, 'Monster's Ball' director Marc Forster looks like he is making a Jason Bourne thriller rather than a James Bond movie.Ian Fleming's James Bond debuted in 1962 with Sean Connery in 'Dr. No.' The Bond movies revolutionized spy thrillers. Before most people could buy the next Fleming novel, United Artists churned out a sequel 'From Russia, With Love.' The third 007 caper 'Goldfinger' created the template for Bonds, and 'Thunderball' ensured the longevity of the franchise. No sooner had Bond redefined spy thrillers than everybody cloned them. Of course, Bond extravaganzas have always embraced adventure more than espionage. Incredibly, in the Cold War era, the Bond producers refused to censure the evil Soviet empire. Instead, 007 battled S.P.E.C.T.R.E, a.k.a. Special Executive for Counter-Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion with larger-than-life villains straight out of old cliffhanger movies like Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon serials. The Bond movies displayed no qualms about occasionally slamming the Red Chinese. After 'You Only Live Twice' in 1967 the Bonds backed off Mao's minions.Since 'Casino Royale,' the new Bonds have forsaken everything that made the longest running franchise original. Audiences watch Bond movies for 007's gadgets, the girls, the exotic locales, and the outlandish stunts. Not only were Bondian foes arch villains who sought to destroy society, but they hatched bizarre plans to achieve their ends. Sometimes, Bond movies scuttled credibility to keep up with the times. For example, 'Star Wars' inspired 'Moonraker.' Nevertheless, 007 gallivanted from one bed to the next for nymphs with naughty names, trumped a gallery of heinous henchmen, and saved the world from extinction.By 1989, Cubby Broccoli overhauled the series with the gritty, hard-as-nails 'License to Kill.' The strategy backfired, and United Artists refused to promote the picture. After the 'License to Kill' debacle, Pierce Brosnan donned the tuxedo and Cubby restored the Roger Moore formula. When production costs escalated, the new Bond producers sacked Brosnan and started from scratch. 'Casino Royale' harkened back to the level-headed 'For Your Eyes Only,' but the success of prequelsprimarily George Lucas's second 'Star Wars' trilogy prompted daughter Barbara Broccoli to re-start the franchise with Bond earning his license to kill.'Quantum of Solace' breaks more rules that 'Casino Royale.' The trademark gun barrel opening scene that started the 20 previous Bonds now precedes the end credits. Actually, 'Quantum' qualifies as a sequel to 'Casino,' something the Bonds have never done. Neither Ms. Moneypenny nor Q return. 'Casino Royale' wrapped with Bond getting the drop on the villainous Mr. White. 'Quantum' opens with 007 careening in his Aston Martin through scenic Italy with a carload of trigger-happy thugs blasting away at him. Bond has Mr. White of 'Casino Royale') stashed in the trunk. He delivers White to M for interrogation. No sooner has their interrogation begun than M's bodyguard Mitchell (utility stunt man Glenn Foster) starts shooting and White escapes. Before he does get away, White chuckles about how the anonymous criminal syndicate that he belongs to has infiltrated virtually every intelligence agency in the world.Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Meanwhile, British Intelligence traces the money that Le Chiffre, the 'Casino Royale' villain, used to a geologist in Panama. Bond tangles with a goon hiding in the dead geologist's motel room. He recovers an attaché case that leads him to a mysterious dame. Camille (Olga Kurylenko of 'Hitman') has been sleeping with Dominic Green (Mathieu Amalric of 'Marie Antoinette'), a hypocritical megalomaniacal environmentalist. Every time 007 collars a bad guy, Green's people ice them and frame Bond for the killing. Green plans to topple the Bolivian government so he can buy up the country's water supply and resell it at higher prices to its new president. Green installs the corrupt General Medrano (Joaquín Cosio of 'Hitgirl') in the presidential palace. Medrano, it turns out, murdered Camille's father, strangled her mother and her sister. Camille's pursuit of Medrano resembles the Roger Moore Bond movie 'For Your Eyes Only.' Bond teams up with Camille to thwart Green and Medrano.Just as the villains in 'Casino Royale' were lightweights, the 'Quantum of Solace' villains are twerps who endanger their own people more than 007. Green wields an axe against Bond but is so incompetent that he whacks his own foot. Green's scheme to monopolize natural global resources is negligible compared with better Bond villains. The fights and the shoot-outs grow monotonously repetitive. 'Quantum of Solace' barely registers on the Richter scale of excitement.",5,7,14,25 November 2008
The Dirty Dozen," One of the Best Behind-the-Enemy-Lines World War II Thrillers!
","'Vera Cruz' director Robert Aldritch made a one-of-a-kind World War II movie with 'The Dirty Dozen' based closely on E.M. Nathanson's bestselling novel about a U.S. Army plan to sneak military prisoners behind enemy lines at a rest and recuperation château where high ranking German officers had time to miss the horrors of war and indulge themselves in wine, good food, classic music, and willing women. Although it is the most popular of the parole-them-from-prison plots, 'The Dirty Dozen' doesn't qualify as the first Hollywood film to exploit this gimmick. The Errol Flynn swashbuckler 'Captain Blood' is the earliest of the films about prisoners who receive a parole or who are exonerated for their crimes in return for valiant service to their country.Nevertheless, this groundbreaking World War II adventure epic spawned many imitators from European filmmakers, and Aldritch himself fared unsuccessfully in his own attempt to imitate himself with 'Too Late the Hero.' Insubordinate U.S. Army officer, Major John Reisman (Lee Marvin of 'Point Blank') finds himself shafted into recruiting twelve hardened criminals that he must then train and take behind enemy lines to carry out a mission. Naturally, Reisman regards the plan as preposterous, and General Denton (Robert Webber of '$') is properly outraged. Reisman argues that these half-wits must receive a pardon or they will not go for the deal. Most of the men that he recruits are awaiting execution of their sentence, namely getting hanged by the neck until dead. General Worden (Ernst Borgnine of 'The Wild Bunch') is inclined to agree with Reisman in his assessment of the plan.Warden picks his twelve prisoners, among them are Victor Franco (John Cassavetes of 'Saddle the Wind'), Archer Maggot (Telly Savalas of 'The Battle of the Bugle'), Samson Posey (Clint Walker of 'Cheyenne'), Robert Jefferson (Jim Brown of 'Rio Conchos'), Vernon Pinkley (Donald Sutherland in a pre-'M.A.S.H.' role), and Joseph Wladislaw (Charles Bronson of 'New So Few'), and they are a dirty, unshaven lot that don't respond well to discipline. 'I think the first chance they get,' observes M.P. Sergeant Bowren (Richard Jaeckel of 'The Devil's Brigade'), 'they will shoot the major in the head.' Reisman relocates his men to a compound that they must build where he trains them in assorted maneuvers. The worst of the bunch is Victor Franco and Reisman uses Franco as a means to draw the others together so that they become the 'Dirty Dozen.' He does this by denying them water to shave with. Meanwhile, snooty Colonel Everett Dasher Breed (Robert Ryan of 'Hour of the Gun') contends that his men can beat Reisman's rabble, so Worden schedules a war games and the Dozen prove that they are fit for their mission. Breed and Reisman hate each other with a passion.Basically, 'The Dirty Dozen' occurs in three parts: (1) the training, (2) the war games gauntlet, and (3) the final mission. The assault on the German château in the last half-hour of 'The Dirty Dozen' is a nail biting, spine-tingler. 'The Dirty Dozen' tops the movie chart as the most profitable movie made in its year of release. Belatedly, a number of lackluster sequels and eventually a short-lived television series followed in the wake of Aldritch's dynamic opus. Probably the most reprehensible character in the 'Dozen' is Telly Savalas' racist Southern redneck who loves to use the N-word. The most suspenseful scene involves Jefferson's dash against machine gun fire as he dumps hand grenades into pipes leading to an underground room in the château. Of course, not everybody survives this blood curdling shoot'em up. The Charles Bronson character manages to stay alive and he has one of the best lines at the end of the film: 'Killing generals could get to be a habit.' The name-dropping celebrity cast, great production values, and taut helming by Aldritch make this a first-rate movie for guys. If you are a World War II fanatic and you haven't seen 'The Dirty Dozen,' then you must watch this movie!",10,2,6,7 July 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Truly, a flight to remember!!!
","Nothing can prepare you for the shocks and surprises in the imaginative movie 'The Butterfly Effect' (*** out of ****) starring Ashton Kutcher, with Amy Smart, Elden Henson, Eric Stoltz, and Melora Walters. Not only have first-time directors J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, who wrote 'Final Destination 2,' fashioned an original, mind-warping psychological chiller about the consequences of time travel, but also these ambitious helmers have woven skillfully into their preposterous but inventive plot a cross-section of everything good and bad about 21st century American society. Incidentally, the film derives its odd title from an idea in chaos theory that the least consequential event, such as a butterfly flying can have sweeping consequences. According to the movie's opening title card, a butterfly flapping its wings in Asia could trigger a typhoon on the other side of the globe.Appropriating a classic science fiction premise from the twice-filmed H.W. Wells novel 'The Time Machine,' Gruber & Bress have managed to simplify a surefire formula without sabotaging it. First, instead of a scientific genius as the protagonist, they have given us a contemporary, black-out prone, twentysomething college student who travels back in time through his mind and learns the same lessons the Wells' hero discovered. In other words, 'The Butterfly Effect' shuns glossy, sophisticated, high-tech gadgetry, so it resembles a 'Twilight Zone' horror fantasy more than a gimmick riddled sci-fi saga. Second, they have omitted the usual mumbo-jumbo, pseudo-scientific explanations about the logistics of time travel that would slow down the action and relied entirely on special effects. Although the story operates on a superficial level, Gruber & Bress have endowed 'Butterfly' with greater gravity than most mainstream Hollywood films dare. The action in this serious mind-bender of a melodrama features several unsavory themes, such as child molestation, animal abuse, prison rape, vandalism, and prostitution. Most people attend movies to escape from these real-life concerns, but Gruber & Bress integrate these issues into the plot.Cast as undergraduate psychology major Evan Treborn, Kutcher discovers accidentally he can travel back in time to his childhood to right wrongs. No, he doesn't get there in a chrome-plated chariot with blinking and flashing lights. He does it in his head. You see, Evan grew up without a father. Society institutionized his dad because he was mentally unstable, and Evan apparently inherited the Treborn curse. Evan suffers recurring black outs and cannot remember what happened after those black outs. As a form of therapy, a psychologist recommends young Evan start a journal, so he can jog his memory. Thirteen years later, Evan has filled up a stack of notebooks. All he has to do relive a page from his past and change it for better or worse is to read it and he finds himself sucked back in the past.Evan's childhood memories are horrid enough to stigmatize anybody, and his mom no longer wants him associating with his small circle of friends: Kayleigh (Amy Smart of 'Rat Race'), Lenny (Elden Henson of 'Idle Hands') and Kayleigh's younger brother Tommy (William Lee Scott of 'Identity'). Earlier, this quartet of ne'er-do-wells found themselves in over their collective heads after they stashed a small stick of T.N.T. with a burning cigarette as its fuse in the mail box at a suburban home just so they can witness the demolition. Incidentally, 'The Butterfly Effect' contains a high quotient of the most politically incorrect violence since 'Final Destination 2.' One sadistic lad traps a dog in a burlap bag, saturates it with kerosene, and burns the canine alive. Eventually, tough little Tommy turns against Evan when our hero gets romantic with Kayleigh. Meantime, Lenny suffers a seizure as a result of their mailbox vandalism. It doesn't help matters either that Kayleigh's pedophilic father (Eric Stoltz of 'Killing Zoe' in a real acting stretch) has been making home movies and molesting his daughter. Later, Evan 's conscientious but naïve mom, Andrea (Arabian-born Melora Walters of 'Cold Mountain'), decides to pull Evan out of school, and they move away to another town.When Evan returns many years later to question Kayleigh about the home movie incident, she flies into a rage and chew him out for dredging up bad memories. The next day an angry Tommy calls Evan and reveals Kayleigh has committed suicide. As Evan pores over his journals, he finds he can go back in the past and change things for the better. The only problem is every time Evan goes back and changes things, he changes not one thing but everything, and everything winds up going from bad to worse.Obviously, 'The Butterfly Effect' isn't just another Ashton Kutcher escapade like 'Dude, Where's My Car,' 'Just Married,' or 'My Boss's Daughter.' This grim, heavyweight yarn about second chances & beyond furnishes Kutcher with his first straight-faced, dramatic role. Yes, Kutcher crosses over with a performance convincing and charismatic enough to give Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Dwayne Johnson, and Guy Pearce some long overdue competition. Your ability to accept Kutcher as this offbeat, tortured hero with powers to change the past will determine how willing you are to suspend your disbelief and enjoy this riveting nail biter. Mind you, 'Butterfly' isn't without its flaws. Some are more obvious than others. Nevertheless, Gruber & Bress maintain enough hair-raising momentum and forge characters who earn our sympathy, so the holes in the plot fade into the background. The cast is uniformly excellent, with the younger actors excelling, especially Jesse James as an incredibly savage young Tommy Miller at age 13. Altogether, 'The Butterfly Effect' is a flight to remember.",Null,0,1,13 March 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Ultimately, 'Alien Versus Predator' is well worth the wait.
","Anybody who suffered through the lackluster 'Predator 2' should remember the final reel when Danny Glover found himself inside the dread-locked Predator's spaceship and saw an Alien's skull displayed on the wall in the trophy room. Of course, that throwaway bit of set dressing meant nothing to the Glover character, but it struck a deep chord with 'Predator' enthusiasts. Since 'Predator 2' came out in 1990, horror fans have been rattling their cages in anticipation of the ultimate sci-fi showdown between the Alien and the Predator. Reportedly, the success of New Line Cinema's 'Freddy vs. Jason' spurred Twentieth Century Fox executives to green-light this crossover creature feature.Surprisingly, 'Alien Versus Predator' (*** out of ****) not only surpasses 'Predator 2,' but also stands up to the original 'Predator' for sheer audacity and imagination. Meanwhile, 'AVP' tops 'Alien 3' and 'Alien Resurrection.' Altogether, 'AVP' furnishes the back story for both franchises and offers a bigger playing field in terms of spectacle. Writer & director Paul W.S. Anderson deserves credit for spinning this gripping, white-knuckled, suspense thriller out of a bit of set dressing. He spends the first hour drumming up suspense before the title characters tangle, with a clever twist ending. Without a doubt, 'AVP' qualifies as everything any hardcore 'Alien' and 'Predator' aficionado would want from a such a monster-match-up. The Aliens drool their acid blood, telescope their slimy double-jaws and whirl those bayonet tails with fiendish abandon. Oh, yes, let's not forget those icky pods with those knuckle-boned face-hugger critters that jump out of them. Anderson neither cheats audiences nor short-changes either creature. The biggest complaint that industrial-strength horror fanatics will voice concerns the violence. The producers scaled back the creature brutality, so 'AVP' could obtain a family-friendly PG-13 rating. For the record, all four 'Alien' movies and both 'Predator' movies received R-ratings. Essentially, the savvy producers trimmed those crucial blood & gore shots, making things appear more poetic and less pukey, while telling the same story. Presumably, the DVD will feature an unrated version for 'Alien' and 'Predator' followers. Nevertheless, 'AVP' ranks as one of the best monster mash movies. Indeed, the preposterous plot and the obvious ending are hopelessly predictable. One monster cannot win. Think about it. Hollywood wouldn't make any more movies about the monster that lost, and Twentieth Century Fox would be out of a franchise. Suffice to say, 'AVP' duplicates the philosophy of all those wonderfully cheesy Nipponese 'Godzilla Versus' whoever epics and takes it to a higher level.Basically, 'Alien Versus Predator' is a prequel. The story unfolds in the fall of 2004 and a satellite in a low orbit owned by Charles Bishop Weyland (gnarly Lance Henriksen of 'Aliens' fame) has identified a heat source deep in frozen Antarctic wastelands. More importantly, the satellite reveals a sprawling pyramid submerged 2,000 feet below an old whaling station mysteriously deserted one-hundred years earlier by its inhabitants. Weyland dispatches his right-hand man, Maxwell Stafford (Colin Salmon of 'Tomorrow Never Dies'), to gather a team of experts to take him to the pyramid before anyone else. Weyland is so anxious to enter the pyramid that he disregards his own health and the safety of his people. Reluctant ice guide leader Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan of 'Love and Basketball') joins chemical engineer Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner of 'Trainspotting'), archaeologists Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova of 'Under The Tuscan Sun') and Thomas Parks (Patrick Troughton's grandson Sam Troughton of 'Sylvia') and driller Rusten Quinn (Carsten Norgaard of 'Soldier') who is anxious to bore a shaft through the ice to the pyramid before a storm strikes. Plans change when they discover a thirty-degree tunnel has mysteriously appeared from the surface down to the pyramid. Once our heroes reach the bottom, they feast their eyes not only on the hidden pyramid, but also a part of a feast, caught as they are between extraterrestrial Predators on safari for hideously deadly alien species. Imagine 'The Most Dangerous Game' with creatures preying on humans, and you've got a fair idea about what 'AVP' has to offer.'Resident Evil' lenser David Johnson frames every shot in 'AVP' as if he were photographing an art film, while Richard Brigland's production designs contribute to the eerie atmosphere. No stranger to sci-fi sagas, writer & director Anderson helmed 'Event Horizon' and 'Resident Evil.' He stages several interesting scenes, especially when the shrieking queen Alien thaws out and lays her eggs for the forthcoming battle royale. He takes us inside the Predator spaceship as the warriors arm themselves 'Rambo' style with wicked spears and throwing discs that deploy knife-like blades in flight for maximum penetration. The first half of 'AVP' resembles 'Stargate' for its hiring sequences. Sanaa Lathan's introduction on an ice-crusted mountain is ingenious. The heroes' arrival in the other world recalls similar events in 'Stargate,' too. Shunning any form of nervous humor, Anderson hypes up the hokum by trapping our heroes--excuse me, monster bait--inside the dark, spooky confines of a pyramid that reconfigures itself every ten minutes like the structure in the 'Cube' movies or 'Thirteen Ghosts.' You can expect a fair share of false alarms, close-calls, and cliffhanger scenes. Ultimately, 'Alien Versus Predator' is well worth the wait.",8,1,2,8 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," Memorable, Chilling Crime Melodrama in the Modern Day Southwest.
","'O' Brother, Where Art Thou' co-directors Joel and Ethan Coen have created another classic melodrama with their quasi-western, road trip crime epic 'No Country for Old Men' about an inexorable killer and his quest to recover millions in illicit drug money. This art-house saga is a simple, but powerful tale that involves four primary characters and a host of supporting characters. Ostensibly, the narrator, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, spends most of his time dwelling on the psychology of the characters as well as the changing times. 'No Country for Old Men' isn't your ordinary shoot'em up with cut and dried heroes and villains. The Coens have adapted the Cormac McCarthy novel and retained its pervasive sense of irony. Indeed, the moral universe of 'No Country' is skewered because the villain survives, the protagonist dies, and the sheriff is so scared that he quits his job. Paid killer Anton Chigurh embodies the essence of pure evil. Despite the fact that he is a flesh & blood character, Chigurh could send shivers up the Terminator's spine because he never gives up. Although the Coens may not realize it, Chigurh resembles another inexorable killer, the Lee Van Cleef gunman called 'Angel Eyes' in director Sergio Leone's 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' Like 'Angel Eyes,' Chigurh always finishes the job no matter what the consequences.The action opens with a sheriff's deputy arresting Chigurh (Javier Bardem of 'Collateral') and taking him in hand cuffs back to the jail. The unsuspecting deputy leaves the cuffed Chigurh sitting in a chair behind him while he calls up the sheriff and talks about the unusual weapon that Chigurh uses to kill people. At the end of the conversation with the sheriff, the deputy promises his boss that 'he has everything under control.' Meanwhile, behind him, Chigurh has slid his cuffed wrists up under his thighs so that he can hold his hands in front of himself. Immediately, he attacks the deputy and they leave many boot heel scuff marks on the floor while they struggle. Chigurh kills the deputy, confiscates a police cruiser, takes his peculiar weapon that consists of a slim canister, a hose, and a firing mechanism and pulls over a motorist, kills him with this odd weapon and steals his car. Later, at a Texaco gas station, Chigurh takes umbrage when the attendant asks him about the weather. This is quite a chilling scene as Chigurh stares at the attendant with his opaque eyes and forces him to play a game that involves flipping a coin. The attendant–like many characters–isn't the brightest bulb in the factory and he can never get Chigurh to spell out the stakes riding on the coin flip.The ostensible protagonist, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin of 'American Gangster'), is hunting deer antelope in the desert and wounds one. He sets out to track down the wounded animal and comes across a scene straight out of Hell, a circle of trucks in the middle of nowhere and bullet-riddled bodies strewn about them with a dead dog. Earlier, Moss saw a wounded pit bull limping in the high weeds. He finds one Mexican still alive but bleeding to death. Eventually, Moss figures out that one Mexican got away and he follows him to a ridge clad with two trees and finds the man dead with a satchel and a shiny automatic pistol. When Moss returns home to his trailer, his wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald of 'Trainspotting') watching television. She inquires about the pistol but Moss brushes off all questions and threatens to take her to bed and have sex with her. She snorts derisively and quips, 'That'll be the day.' Later that night, Moss decides to return to the scene of the shooting because his conscience has gotten to him about the sole survivor that he found. No sooner has he set foot on the scene that some Mexicans wheel up in a truck, slash his tires, pursue him and take shots at him. Moss dives into a river and the Mexicans dispatch a tenacious pit bull dog that leaps into the river and swims after him. Moss barely gets out of the river and clears his pistol before the dog lunges at him and he guns it down. You don't often see dogs die in modern-day movies.Chigurh arrives on the scene with two other men later on, studies the site, shoots them and sets out to find the stolen money. 'No Country' depicts his pursuit of Moss. These two guys are pretty obstinate characters. Neither one of them gives up, but Moss has no idea about the lengths to which Chigurh is committed to go. Moss sends Carla Jean off to Odessa, Texas, to be with her mother while he heads off in a different direction. At the same time, Sheriff Ed Tom and his deputy investigate the killings and Ed Tom is clearly shaken by what he sees of this killer. In a border town, Moss and Chigurh shoot it out in the street after Chigurh storms the hotel where Moss had holed up and kills the night clerk. He wounds Moss, but Moss wounds him, too. Chigurh stages a car fire in front of a pharmacy to get the medical supplies to tend to his wounds, while Moss walks across the border at night and winds up in a Mexican hospital where he recuperates.'No Country for Old Men' is a chilling tale of crime in the southwest about a killer who will stop at nothing to complete his mission. Nevertheless, this isn't an action shoot'em up clever dialogue. Nothing goes as it should in a regular crime melodrama. Good loses in the long run and evil wins out in the end. This movie justifiably received four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Bardem netted the Best Supporting Oscar for his killer.",10,3,5,23 July 2009
District 9," What Is All The Hoopla About--Worst Sci-fi saga in Ages!!!
","Director Neill Blomkamp's freshman, feature-length, dystopian sci-fi thriller 'District 9' qualifies as both grotesque and ghoulish. Worse, heavily-laden with anti-apartheid messages, it emerges nevertheless as an uneven blend of Monty Pythonesque humor wrapped around a serious polemic about alien rights. Does anybody remember director Christopher Columbus''Bicentennial Man' (1999) with Robin Williams and lack of concern for alien rights? Despite some visceral action sequences that attest to Blomkamp's expertise at staging action, this nimble but numb-skulled nail-biter puts the protagonist in a thoroughly impossible position. Essentially, 'District 9' exemplifies those supernatural films that occur primarily on Earth with the 'aliens are among us' theme. Mankind knows that aliens have arrived. In fact, not only have we accepted them, we have grossly taken advantage of them! These aliens are neither as lovable as 'Wall-E' lovable nor as cunning as the 'Terminator.' Indeed, given their slender, emaciated bodies that resemble naked Jews in a Nazi concentration camp.You could call 'District 9': 'The Day the Aliens Stood Still.' Blomkamp and co-scenarist Terri Tatchell encapsulate the action in a fictional expose television documentary. Intermittently, Blomkamp indulges himself with adrenalin-laced dramatic footage that no documentary film could have captured without staging it. At other times, Blomkamp cross-cuts black & white footage from surveillance cameras to eavesdrop on our woebegone hero at weak moments. Essentially, he is imitating 'Cloverfield' scenario, except for those few sequences that do not dovetail into the documentary. Not surprisingly, 'District 9' borrows from a number of sci-fi fantasies. A gigantic alien spaceship visits Earth like in 'Independence Day,' but this spacecraft cannot leave. The spaceship hovers over Johannesburg, South Africa, for three months before the authorities board it. The skeletal aliens that humans find inside suffer from malnutrition, and the good folks in Johannesburg, confine these destitute aliens in what constitutes a huge slum. Humans treat the aliens like second-class citizens and allow them to sink into squalor. The aliens resort to crime to make ends meet and are often at odds with the authorities. No, 'District 9' shares little in common with the conventional 'Alien Nation.' These aliens look like they walked off the set of a 'Predator' movie and--unlike most alien invaders--they are not as intimidating as their counterparts. These aliens remain largely at our mercy, and Blomkamp renders humanity as brutal and unscrupulous in their treatment of the aliens.'District 9' opens with several talking heads as part of a documentary about the scandal involving the protagonist. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copely) is an ordinary field representative for Multi-National United, (MNU), a private company that has dominion over the aliens. Escalating alien crime and violence has prompted the government to move some 1.8 million aliens to the new District 10 camp located outside of Johannesburg. Backed up by armed helicopters hovering overhead, MNU field representatives serve eviction orders on the aliens. Our hero' s father-in-law, Piet Smit (Louis Minnaar) assigns him to head up the mission. During an inspection of a domicile, Wikus discovers a suspicious cylinder among an arms cache. When he fumbles with it, a vile black liquid sprays his face, contaminating him with alien DNA. As the story open, Wikus is already under investigation. The tabloids carry pictures of him mating with aliens. We are given a recap of the story and then the second half opens as Wikus grows flippers on his left hand. Suddenly, Wikus becomes the most prized human alive with the alien DNA polluting his bloodstream. Alien guns that scientists could never have fired now discharge at Wikus' half-breed DNA touch. Mind you, Wikus refuses to fire the weapons, but his captors shock him with cattle prods until he accommodates them. Wikus goes berserk and escapes from the laboratory. He joins forces with an intelligent, inventor-type alien named Christopher. Christopher wants to rekindle the energy of his command capsule so he can get back to the spacecraft overhead and haul freight.Basically, 'District 9' appropriates the 'what if' sci-fi theme and employs it as a metaphor for a social consciousness sermon about racial xenophobia. Neither Blomkamp nor Tatchell regard humanity in a sentimental light. Worse, we are asked to sympathize with a hero who is a complete imbecile. The theme of man's inhumanity to aliens comes through 'loud and clear.' Imagine a science fiction movie that takes place in a third world country and you've summed up 'District 9.' These aliens aren't cool. They look like big bugs and they speak in guttural language. Everybody refers to them contemptuously as 'prawns.' Blomkamp translates the alien lingo in white subtitles. The prawns are as pathetic as the hero who behaves as if he were in a Woody Allen comedy. He is a naive moron, a laughingstock, a fall guy. The important part of the plot transpires when he undergoes a quasi-alien metamorphosis a la Franz Kafka meets 'The Fly.' Blomkamp lenses 'District 9' like a documentary, and its bureaucratic hero makes an ass out of himself. He couldn't be any more abject if he were John Cleese in a Monty Python skit. Eventually, after he gets contaminated, he begins his transformation into an alien with one hand turning into an alien claw. Yes, the aliens do resemble huge insects which make them appear less hostile but far from appealing. Indeed, Blomkamp creates a very convincing alternative universe in that the story is credible and as down to earth as any sci-fi you can imagine. Eventually, the alien along with the Wikus Van De Merwe bureaucratic hero launch a one-man/one-alien war against the repressive organization MNU that keeps the alien cooped up in the worse circumstances. The section between Merwe escaping and then teaming up with Christopher is action packed, but there are no surprises in this flat movie. I cannot believe that so many people are going ape about this asinine little flick.",1,25,61,15 August 2009
Mamma Mia!," 'Mamma Mia!' Says (Sings) It ALL!
","The new Meryl Streep & Pierce Brosnan musical 'Mamma Mia!' qualifies as a feel-good, passionate celebration of life, love, and happiness rolled up into a screwball comedy of errors. Executive producers Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks obtained the rights to the long-running West End London stage play that knits the songs of the Swedish rock group ABBA into the narrative. 'Mamma Mia!' has been running on stages around the world since 1999. Indeed, ABBA's 1975 chart-topper 'Mamma Mia!' was the inspiration for the title. Although the band provided their popular disco-era songs, this musical comedy concentrates on a cast of characters that has nothing to do with ABBA. You could compare 'Mamma Mia!' with the somewhat similar 2007 musical 'Across the Universe' that integrated Beatles tunes into its tragedy-laden plot, except 'Mamma Mia!' is ten times better.Originally, British playwright Catherine Johnson adapted the 'Mamma Mia!' plot from the obscure 1968 Gina Lollobrigida comedy 'Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell.' Despite its effervescent plot, however, you have to groove on ABBA's tunes because Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus's lyrics permeate the plot. Furthermore, people that loathe disco music should avoid this musical like the plague. Otherwise, this chick flick ranks as first-rate entertainment, and Johnson's screenplay empowers women and ripples with surprises galore. English director Phyllida Lloyd knew a thing or two about 'Mamma Mia!' before she helmed it because she directed the Broadway play version.Blond, never-married, single-mom, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep of 'The Devil Wears Prada'), operates a quaint little hotel, the Villa Donna, perched atop a mountain on the tiny remote Greek island of Kalokairi in the Mediterranean Sea. Donna's 20-year-old daughter Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried of 'Veronica Mars') lives with her, and Sophie is preparing for her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper of 'The Escapist') at the hotel. Sophie wants desperately to know the identity of the father that she never knew so that he can give her away at her wedding. She swipes her mom's secret diary and discovers three prime suspects. Although she has no idea which one of the three sired her, Sophie decides to mail them wedding invitations. She convinces herself that once she lays eyes on them that she will recognize her dad. Divorced architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan of 'GoldenEye'), rich investment banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth of 'Bridget Jones' Diary'), and globetrotting Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgård of 'Good Will Hunting) all receive Sophia's invitations and rush off to Kalokairi. Mistakenly, the three men think that Donna has invited them to the wedding. Anyway, Sam and Harry miss the last ferry for the island, but Bill owns a sail boat and welcomes them aboard. They reach the island and Sophie intercepts them. The surpriseas it turns outis on Sophie. She cannot figure out which is her father! Meanwhile, Donna's close friends, a writer named Rosie (Julie Walters of 'Educating Rita') and a wealthy thrice divorced dame Tanya (Christine Baranski of 'Chicago'), arrive for Sophie's wedding. Desperately, Sophie hides the three guys in a goat house to keep her mother from learning about their presence on the island. Eventually, Donna discovers Sam, Harry, and Bill. Initially, she is overjoyed that the three have come to Kalokairi, but then she takes a different attitude and asks them to leave. Of course, they cannot and won't at this point because they want to see who sired Sophie. They retreat to Bill's boat. Sophie learns things about her hippie mom that she didn't know. Young Donna indulged in a carefree, rebellious, lifestyle that included lots of sex with all three men at different times. Donna knew that she was pregnant with Sophie not long after her last lover left. She refused to share the information about the birth of her daughter with Sophie's dad. Moreover, Donna's stern mother refused to take her pregnant daughter back so Donna stuck around in the Greece and had Sophie. The mystery that everybody tries to resolve for the rest of the action is the identity of Sophie's dad.'Mamma Mia!' radiates rainbows of infectious energy, in part owing to its array of ABBA songs. The champagne frothy, transcendental music of ABBA imbues this innocuous movie with lighter-than-helium buoyancy. Indeed, audiences could literally dance in the aisles for the movie seems like a concert with a plot. Director Phyllida Lloyd keeps those few quiet, introspective moments of intimacy to a minimum. Although 'Mamma Mia' is a chick flick, it is neither a heartbreaker nor a tearjerker. Nobody dies from a sudden bout of cancer. Furthermore, this madcap comedy of errors doesn't have a dull moment. Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski must have been dosed up with Ritalin. Rarely do they sit around and talk. They are dancing, singing, and cavorting about a scenic Greek island, and they look like that had a terrific time. What makes 'Mamma Mia!' so enjoyable is the elaborate way that the ABBA tunes have been worked in to compliment the film's themes. The cast, especially 59-year old Streep, does a great job of belting out chartbusters like 'Super Trouper,' 'Dancing Queen,' 'Knowing Me, Knowing You,' 'Thank You for the Music,' 'Money, Money, Money,' 'The Winner Takes It All,' 'Voulez Vous,' 'I Have a Dream,' and 'SOS.' Moreover, the resolution to the mystery of Sophie's dad and the surprises that occur as a result will keep you guessing. If you missed taking a summer vacation, you can take a chance on 'Mamma Mia!' The lush Greek scenery, the entertaining storyline, and the enchanting performances will transport you out of the doldrums.",10,4,5,19 August 2008
Batman Begins," Hardcore fans of DC Comics' Batman can finally have their cape and eat it, too!
","This Caped Crusader prequel, appropriately entitled 'Batman Begins'tops all previous 'Batman' epics, beginning with Tim Burton's revisionist 1989 'Batman' starring Michael Keaton and winding down with Joel Schumacher's cartoon-like 'Batman and Robin' (1997) with George Clooney. Fortunately, 'Memento' writer & director Christopher Nolan brings a welcome sense of gravity to the legendary DC Comics mortal hero franchise that eluded earlier epics. (I'm not including either the supremely satirical 'Batman' TV series and its spin-off movie or either 'Batman' film serials from 1943 and 1949. The first two Burton-helmed features 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' converted our hero into a dark, lone avenger, negotiating a surreal landscape and clashing with warped villains, while the Schumacher 'Batman' movies tried to lighten things up by imitating the seminal 1960's live-action, ABC-TV series. Although 'Blade' scenarist David Goyer and Nolan get nearly about everything right, they fall just short of perfection on three counts. First, the featherweight casting of Katie Holmes as an anemic but idealistic love interest who acts like every damsel-in-distress weakens not only the plot but any respect we might have felt for her clichÃ©d heroine. Second, the heavyweight presence of two-time, Oscar-winner Michael Caine as a highly dignified but personable Alfred, Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, literally blows Christian Bale off the screen whenever they appear together. The senior British superstar dominates every scene and everybody around him with the merest facial expression or the inflection of a line of dialogue. Similarly, as if to compensate for our limited exposure to Bale as a fixture in mainstream movies, Warner Brothers has stuffed this superior saga with other high-profile celebrity actors, such as Oscar-winner Morgan Freeman, Emmy-winner Gary Oldman, and none other than Rutger Hauer in a breakout role from his usual straight-to-video tripe. The Brothers Warner need not have worried, because Bale ranks as the best Batman to date. Third, Goyer and Nolan give Bruce Wayne's playboy billionaire character the short shrift and emphasize instead his death-defying alter-ego. Reckless, debonair playboy Bruce Wayne shows up for only a couple of scenes. (Aside from these complaints, the only other problem that bothered me in this spectacularly lensed, richly atmospheric crime melodrama was the beards that Bale and Oscar-nominated Liam Neeson wear at the outset. The beards appeared as bored stiff make-up artists had pasted them onto the actors!) Meanwhile, a dynamic ending sets us up for the inevitable sequel. Happily, everybody from the original has been signed up for the follow-up film, except the expendable Holmes, and up as Batman's next nemesis, no doubt an homage to Burton's 'Batman,' is the Joker. 'Batman Begins' benefits immensely from the offbeat casting of second-string leading man Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader. Imagine Michael Keaton buffed up and stretched out on a rack to leading man heights, and you'll get a good idea what to expect from 'American Psycho' star. Not only does he exert more presence as Batman, Bale looks rugged enough and believable as an individual who has endured more than his share of tragedy and turmoil. Unlike the unhinged Keaton Batman, Bale doesn't have an anger management problem. If anything, Bale's Batman suffers from a fear management problem. Furthermore, Bale doesn't look like the Ken doll that pretty boy Val Kilmer was, and the Batman costume that Bale dons isn't decked out with nipples like the one George Clooney had to wear in 'Batman and Robin.' Indeed, Goyer and Nolan had elevated their Batman to Shakespearean heights. Like the Keaton 'Batman' movies, 'Batman Begins' qualifies as a dark, foreboding thriller with horrific touches that you'd never imagine in a PG-13 rated movie. Best of all 'Batman Begins' provides a solid basis for the origins of the Caped Crusader. During the first third of the action, Goyer and Nolan examine Bruce Wayne's troubled childhood, the random but cold-blooded back alley murder of his parents, and the guilt that impressionable young Bruce shoulders as a result of his parents' death. Indeed, the sequences with a grown-up Bruce slugging it out with thuggish inmates at a Red Chinese prison are about as far out as any Batman movie has ever dared to go. Happily, Goyer and Nolan have given Bruce Wayne a legitimate reason for venturing off to China, so these scenes don't degenerate into a sight-seeing travelogue. 'Batman Begins' shows us what the Batcave looked like before the furniture found its way into it. Unlike the last four 'Batman' pictures, 'Batman Begins' confines itself to one major villain backed up by two secondary bad guys who are no slouches in themselves. Liam Neeson arrives earliest as Bruce Wayne's ruthless battle teacher. A great deal of similarity exists between Neeson's role here and his Jedi Knight in George Lucas' 'Star Wars, Episode One: The Phantom Menace.' Oscar-winner English actor Tom Wilkinson of 'In the Bedroom' (2002) makes villainous Carmine Falcone into a loud-mouthed, unsympathetic lout, while Irish actor Cillian Murphy brings a fiendish quality to an otherwise mild-mannered Dr. Krane. Meanwhile, in keeping with 'Batman Begins' prequel status, Bale cuts quite a figure in the least glamorous looking Batman outfit, which features no signature Bat chest-piece emblem. If you took the best parts of the four earlier Batman movies and balanced them out, you'd come close to 'Batman Begins.' Hardcore fans of DC Comics' Batman can finally have their cape and eat it, too.Principally, 'Batman Begins' differs from the other movies based on Bob Kane's immortal comic book character in that it borrows the training sequences from the Antonio Banderas swashbuckler 'The Mask of Zorro' and adds elements of spiritualism from marital arts movies. Ultimately, 'Batman Begins' ushers the Caped Crusader into the 21st century with fanfare galore. If you call yourself a 'Batman' fan, you're going to have to watch this movie.",9,1,1,21 June 2007
Twilight," A Terrific Tale of Forbidden Teenage Love!
","The romantic horror fantasy thriller 'Twilight' qualifies as a terrific tale about forbidden love and passionate angst for teenage damsels. 'Nativity Story' helmer Catherine Hardwicke and 'Birds of Prey' scenarist Melissa Rosenberg have done a splendid job adapting bestselling author Stephenie Meyer's first-person novel about a virgin in love with a vampire. Mind you, these vampires are nothing like Bela Lugosi's 'Dracula.' Instead, these bloodsuckers can cavort in the daylight without getting burnt to a cinder. Moreover, they can gaze at themselves in mirrors, and they have no fangs to bare! While this radical departure from standard vampire lore may grieve 'Blade' and 'Buffy' fans from watching this chick-lite, WB-style saga, the young lovesick females who have made Meyers' four novels smash hits with 17 million copies sold in 37 countries could care less. This PG-13 rated romancer about the sexual attraction between two high school juniors confronts the temptations all teens face but it also marks the boundaries of true love. Furthermore, unlike its closest counterpart, a yarn called 'Blood and Chocolate' about the illicit love between a graphic novelist on the lam in Europe and a shape-shifting female werewolf, 'Twilight' is neither as gritty nor as gory. 'Twilight' may keep its audiences awake at night, but they won't be suffering from nightmares.Isabella 'Bella' Swan (Kristen Stewart of 'Jumper') has spent most of her life with her flaky mom in Phoenix, Arizona. As 'Twilight' opens, our dark-haired heroine flies off to live with her divorced police chief dad, Charlie Swan (Billy Burks of 'Fracture'), in rainy Forks, Washington. It seems that Bella's mom, Renee (Sarah Clarke of 'Thirteen'), and her new hubby, minor league baseball player Phil (Matt Bushell of 'Leatherheads'), are hitting the road, and Bella wants the stable environment that only her dad can provide. It doesn't help matters that Bella is both awkward and accident prone. She cannot play volleyball without spiking her own teammates, and she isn't light on her feet when she dances. When she arrives at Forks High School, she manages to get in with the right crowd, but it is the guy in the wrong crowd that arouses her. Cadaverously pale Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson who plays Cedric Diggory in the 'Harry Potter' franchise) cannot take his eyes off Bella anymore than she can look away from him. They get off on the wrong foot when he storms out of biology class, but soon they are as thick as thieves.Early in the story, Bella is hanging out in the school parking lot by her jalopy of an ancient Chevy truck when another student, Tyler Crowley (newcomer Gregory Tyree Boyce) races onto campus. Another student pulls out in front of Tyler, and Tyler swerves and skids his van sideways. Bella looks up and stands paralyzed with fear. At the last possible second, Edward appears out of nowhere and keeps Tyler's van from creaming her. Bella stares in shock at the way Edward manages to halt the careening van with his hand. Later, Edward assures her it was nothing more than an adrenaline rush, but Bella doesn't believe him. No matter how many times Edward warns Bella to have nothing to do with him, she dreams about him. Eventually, they become fast friends, and our heroine discovers that there is more to Edward than meets the eye.Hardwicke and Rosenberg take liberties with Meyer's novel, but the changes are relatively minor and make the action more palatable. I've read the novel once and seen the movie three times. Sticklers for detail may object to the differences, but by and large the alterations are for the better. Meyer penned the book in first-person so that everything is filtered through Bella's perspective. No third-person movie adaptation can replicate the first-person novel experience so some moviegoers may have a legitimate beef. Nevertheless, the shift in narration from first to third person presents greater opportunities for delicious red herrings and white-knuckled suspense. While Bella and Edward gradually grow accustomed to their respective fears and foibles, vicious vampires that drink human blood are attacking people in remote places. No, 'Twilight' is nothing like '30 Days of Night.' Hardwicke and Rosenberg don't confine the humor strictly to Bella and Edward's quirky relationship. Police Chief Swan is so concerned about Bella's new boyfriend that he gives his daughter a can of pepper-spray.Ostensibly, 'Twilight' is lightweight blast. The chemistry between Stewart's Bella and Pattinson's Edward is spot perfect. Edward is drawn to Bella because, unlike all the other students, he cannot figure her out. She baffles him, while Bella struggles to understand Edward's bizarre behavior. Robert Pattinson bears a striking resemblance to 1950's heartthrob John Derek. While Hardwicke conjures up humor in the offbeat coupling of Bella and Edward, the relationship between Bella and her estranged father Charlie recalls the oddball relationship between Harry Dean Stanton and Molly Ringwald in the John Hughes comedy 'Pretty in Pink.' Despite the audience demographic that 'Twilight' plays to, Hardwicke never misses a chance to make this thriller look smart and sophisticated. Watch the high school scene when the teacher talks about rewarding the best lab partners with a golden onion. The last half-hour of 'Twilight' shifts into high gear as Bella meets Edward's immortal family and some interlopers. What little violence occurs in this lushly photographed film occurs in those final 30 minutes. Nevertheless, you don't have to be a teenager to enjoy 'Twilight' as a chaste romance with a twinge of tension.",10,2,9,10 December 2008
Liar Liar," 'Liar, Liar' doesn't capture any of the 'Ace Ventura' lunacy
","Although Jim Carrey's pants never catch on fire in director Tom Shadyac's 'Liar, Liar,' this modestly funny comedy should shield him from the bad connection that he made last summer with his offbeat change of character comedy 'The Cable Guy.' 'Liar, Liar' reteams the elastic faced comic with his inventive 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' director Tom Shadyac, who pulled Eddie Murphy's dying career out of the doldrums with 'The Nutty Professor.' Unhappily, neither Shadyac nor Carrey can chuckle up the barrels of laughter needed to tickle their wishy-washy script. 'Liar, Liar' casts Carrey as divorced, upscale, philandering lawyer, Fletcher Reede, who lives to lie and lies to live. His lies have already sabotaged his marriage, and his ambitions to become a partner in an illustrious law firm now threaten to scuttle his daddy ship.Hollywood has given us another adorable mop-headed child actor, Justin Cooper. When Fletcher skips out on his son's birthday party, Max wishes that his pop could stop lying for a day. As Fletcher is about to defend a conniving slut, Samantha Cole (Jennifer Tilly of 'Bound') in a multi-million dollar alimony suit that could win him his partnership, he finds himself compelled to tell nothing but the truth! The premise of 'Liar, Liar' is as cute and predictable as any episode of the Elizabeth Montgomery TV sitcom 'Bewitched.' Plug Carrey into any predicament that prompts him to prevaricate, and you'll laugh yourself silly at his shenanigans. If you've the 'Liar, Liar' trailer, you've seen some of the movie's funnier moments. But there's still just enough added hilarity to justify ticket sales. The scene in the board room where Carrey spreads the awful truth about his boss, Mr. Allen (Mitchell Ryan of 'Magnum Force'), and his co-workers is outrageously funny. The outtakes at the end of the movie are as funny as anything from an old Burt Reynolds comedy, too.Sadly, the guffaws don't go far enough in 'Liar, Liar.' Although Carrey dominates the film with is trademark facial contortions, the producers have seen fit to shackle his insanity within a morality tale of suburban schmaltz. When Carrey fight to fib, his face erupts into a kaleidoscope of cheek-tweaking, lip-curling, jaw-jutting expressions matched only by the kind of bodily gyrations that would make him the envy of St. Vitus. The trouble starts when 'Heartbreakers' scenarists Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur confine Carrey's clowning so that they can develop their sentimental, happily-ever-after storyline. As one movie critic observed, this kind of movie would have been perfect for Michael Keaton, but for Jim Carrey, it is a misfire.'Liar, Liar's' unwholesome plot elements distract you from the humor. First, they have made Carrey a divorced dad. Second, they have him sleeping with his boss mistress in a 'Disclosure' style subplot. Third, they have him trying to break up his ex-wife, Audrey Reede (sexy Maura Tierney of 'Semi-Pro') and her hopelessly bland boyfriend Jerry (Cary Elwes of 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights'). Jerry wants to wed Audrey and wing her off to Boston where he has a job as a hospital administrator. When Fletchers learns that he may lose his son, he experiences a radical conversion that makes you want to cry instead of giggle. Hollywood prefers to whitewash its heroes, but Fletcher seems beyond redemption by the time that he realizes the error of his ways. That's the problem with this contrived comedy; it's far too washy and not wishy enough.'Liar, Liar' helmer Tom Shadyac seems to have forgotten the light touch. He spends more time deploying his actor for the big jokes instead of letting you enjoy the Carrey-on type of humor that made Carrey a box office sensation. The moments when Carrey gets to mug are wonderful, but when he becomes a puppet of the plot, 'Liar, Liar' folds.Although 'Liar, Liar' doesn't capture any of the 'Ace Ventura' lunacy, Jim Carrey's fans should find it a welcome relief after his role as 'The Cable Guy.'",7,0,1,11 June 2008
Meet the Fockers," 'MTF' evokes more laughs than its side-splitting predecessor.
","Anybody who laughed themselves silly watching the Ben Stiller & Robert De Niro in-laws farce 'Meet The Parents' (2000) will probably find its long-overdue sequel 'Meet The Fockers' incredibly hilarious from fade-in to fade-out. Rare remains the sequel that surpasses the original, but 'MTF' evokes more laughs than its side-splitting predecessor. Not surprisingly, 'MTF' gets even more mileage out of the suggestively obscene surname of the Ben Stiller protagonist: Greg Focker. For example, we learn about Greg's cousins: Randy and Orney as well as his uncle Dom. In fact, director Jay Roach convinced the Motion Picture Producers of America (the MPPA) to let the title stand, because some families have Focker as their last name! Whether the family name appears on a caller ID or a book cover, the filmmakers never miss a chance to use the name for the sake of comedy. Furthermore, much of the laughter this time around arises from lowest common denominator gags of the 'American Pie' variety rather than the catastrophic Murphy's Laws lunacy of 'MTP.' Good sequels build on the foundation of the original, and the highlight of 'MTF' is the inspired casting of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as Ben Stiller's parents. Streisand hasn't had this much loopy fun on-screen since 1972 when she drove Ryan O'Neal nuts in Peter Bogdanovich's 'What's Up, Doc?' Meanwhile, Dustin Hoffman of 'Tootsie' steals the show with his outrageously energetic antics. You've never see Hoffman as hammy as he is here. When they appear together in a scene, Hoffman and Streisand dominate it, even with DeNiro in the same room. In 'MTP,' Ben Stiller struggled to make a good impression on his fiancée's uptight, WASPy father, a recently retired CIA psychological profiler (Robert DeNiro of 'Analyze This') who took an immediate dislike to him because he was a male nurse. In 'MTF,' Stiller finds himself caught in the middle between his own loony-tunes parents and his suspicious future father-in-law. One-fourth of the humor is watching Stiller act like a referee, the second-fourth is the Streisand/Hoffman casting as his crazy folks, the third-fourth is DeNiro making a boob out of himself, and the last fourth is a top-drawer performance by twins Spencer and Bradley as Little Jack.No, you don't really need to have seen 'MTP' to laugh your fanny off at 'MTF.' If you like to laugh out loud, and crude, uncouth clowning doesn't offend you, you'll have a giddy good time. Basically, scenarists John Herzfeld and John Hamburg (who penned the original) have recycled the same predicament, but they put Robert DeNiro's Jack Byrnes at the mercy of Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman & Barbara Streisand), rather than making Greg the butt of all the jokes. One of the funnier Greg jokes is the revelation about how our hero lost his virginity. The dinner scene where one of Greg's treasured keepsakes from the baby delivery room that his parents have preserved is another. As the film unspools, Jack has agreed grudgingly to meet Greg's parents. Instead of flying off to Florida to meet the Fockers, Jack hauls his wife Dina (Blythe Danner of 'The Prince of Tides'), their grandson Little Jack (twins Spencer & Bradley Picken) along with Pam (Teri Polo of 'Mystery Date') and Greg in an RV that resembles something out of a James Bond spy thriller. Yes, Jack cooks up a scene here as good as the lie-detector test in 'MTP.' The impressionable grandson belongs to Pam's nephew, and Little Jack is so young that Jack still prefers to feed him freshly-pumped mother's milk from a life-like breast prosthesis that the elder Jack wears strapped across his chest like a shoulder holster. You guessed it, 'MTP' contains gross, physical humor. The sight of a closely-cropped, scowling Robert DeNiro of 'Taxi Driver' fame sporting a single, false female breast had the audience that I sat with howling for their lives. Thoroughly manipulative as always, Jack intends to raise Little Jack using the denial method. In other words, Jack doesn't indulge Little Jack. He tenders him tough love. No TV. No candy. No Sympathy. When they meet Roz and Bernie, Jack and Dina confront their worse nightmare. Roz earns her living as a sex therapist who writes self-help books like 'Is Your Vagina Happy?' and 'Meet Your Orgasm.' Bernie is a former lawyer turned house-husband who loves to lock the doors and cover Roz with shaving cream. Another sight-gag that comes into good use is a hat that Bernie hangs on the bedroom door knob. As free-wheeling, hippies from the 1960s, you can imagine how they crate on poor Jack and criticize his parenting methods. When Jack isn't looking, Bernie and Roz spoil Little Jack. Alas, when bad luck prone Greg tries to spoil Little Jack, he accidentally teaches the toddler a profane word that the little guy does his level best to wear out in front of everybody.Director Jay Roach (who helmed the 'Austin Powers' trilogy) gets away with more than you'd think this time. One subplot involves a toilet-trained kitty and a small dog with an addiction to sex. Combine the two and imagine the worst. The scene where Roz gives Jack a massage is probably the funniest that you'll ever see Barbara Streisand in with an actor the stature of Robert DeNiro. Sure, the humor is slapstick but it rarely stops slapping. The only drawback to a classic like 'MTF' is that too many people will still be laughing when crucial dialogue is delivered immediately after a joke. Altogether, rude, crude, and contagiously funny, 'Meet the Fockers' will knock you off your rocker!",10,0,0,18 June 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Above Average Sword & Sorcery Saga Suffers from Predictability
","Long before he took the helm of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, New Zealand born Peter Jackson had acquired both a name and a reputation for himself as an independent splatter-gore horror movie maestro. If you haven't seen 'Bad Taste' (1987), 'Meet the Feebles' (1989), and ultimately 'Dead Alive,' you've missed three memorable epics. Repellent in some respects but brilliant in others with the brilliant winning out over the repellent summarizes these films. The squeamish should shun them. 'Bad Taste' lives up to its title, while 'Meet the Feebles' teeters on puppet porn with scenes that anticipated the 2004 gross-out fest 'Team America: World Police.' Jackson went mainstream with 'Heavenly Creatures' (1984) starring Kate Winslet of 'Titanic' fame. Later, in 1996, he put 'Back to the Future' lead Michael J. Fox through the paces in his supernatural chiller 'The Frighteners.' These two are both worth renting if you've never watched them. Ultimately, Jackson ascended into the pantheon of movie directors with the 'Rings' trilogy. Sadly, his creative star plunged with his dreadful 'King Kong' remake and the lackluster but sympathetic crime thriller 'The Lonely Bones.' Now, Jackson sets out to relive his glory days with 'The Hobbit.' Essentially, Jackson's Golden Age consists of his J.R.R. Tolkien adaptations of 'The Lord of the Rings' with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' (2001), followed by 'The Two Towers' (2002) and finally the 'The Return of the King' (2003). Unfortunately, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' emerges as a pale imitation of Jackson's earlier Middle-earth triumphs. No end of money has been lavished on this sprawling spectacle that serves as the first act of the planned 'Hobbit' trilogy. Virtually everybody from the earlier trilogy reprises the roles they created in the 'Rings' extravaganzas. Christopher Lee, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchet, Hugo Weaving, and Elijah Wood drop in for a scene or two. Ian McKellen doesn't wander through every scene, but he clocks in more time than anybody else. By now, you're probably shaking your head about the decision Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema made to make more than one film out of 'The Hobbit or There and Back Again.' Wasn't it bad enough when Hollywood divided the last 'Harry Potter' novel into two movies? Or that they perpetrated the same strategy with the final 'Twilight' novel 'Breaking Dawn?' Audaciously, Warner and New Line have gone one film further by stretching 'The Hobbit' into three, not just two films! Ostensibly, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' qualifies as an above-average but predictable first installment in Jackson's newest, larger-than-life, mythological, sword and sorcery trilogy. Martin Freeman, who co-stars as Dr. Watson in the BBC series 'Sherlock,' was born to play furry-footed Bilbo Baggins. Freeman has a knack for comedy. He is an unobtrusive comic. He doesn't attract attention to himself, and he savors subtlety the same way that the great silent era comic Buster Keaton did. This minimalist approach makes Freeman appear far more hilarious. One can only hope either or both of the remaining 'Hobbit' movies do Freeman justice. Freeman imparts both a sparkle and sense of spontaneity to these formulaic antics that nobody but lanky McKellen can rival. On the other hand, as sympathetic a character as Bilbo is, he is one of the few who has nothing to worry about regarding his survival. Similarly, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen of 'X-Men') is immune from death, too. Meantime, it is reassuring to see his peaked hat. Everything in 'The Hobbit,' you must understand, is spelled out in flashback by Ian Holm's elderly Bilbo at the genesis of the action.The grungy villains are a step down in quality from the 'Rings' trilogy. The problem is they aren't very menacing, even for a PG-13 film. Jackson keeps the violence fairly immaculate, too. 'The Hobbit' suffers because it lacks a centerpiece villain. The gauntlet of computer-generated adversaries that our heroes encounter aren't impressive. The 'Twilight' wolves looked far more ferocious than these wolves Worst, the movie ends eleven minutes shy of three hours. Comparatively, the theatrical 'Rings' movies ran about the same length. Nevertheless, Jackson subjects us to lengthy expository-laden scenes throughout and this loquacity slows down 'The Hobbit' until our heroes plunge into battle. The first 40 minutes of 'The Hobbit' feels like 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.' Various dwarfs assemble at Bilbo's home in the Shire for an impromptu party. Jackson plays this scene strictly for laughs, but nothing about this scene is remotely side-splitting. Naturally, these fellows with their droopy snouts consume everything in sight, while Gandalf entreats the Halfling to join them. Mind you, Bilbo is content in his easy chair with a library and a larder within arm's reach. Gandalf persuades Bilbo to join them and experience life first hand. Actually, Bilbo differs very little from contemporary couch potatoes. An evil dragon named Smaug, it seems, has evicted the sword-wielding dwarfs of Erebor. 'The Hobbit' depicts the quest of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and thirteen dwarfs embark upon to reoccupy their kingdom known as the Lonely Mountain. Not until fadeout do the pugnacious dwarfs accept Bibo as one of their own. The 'Transformer' mountain warriors are imaginative and reminded me of the asteroid in 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back' where a desolate rock changed into a creature when Han Solo took refuge in it. The best scene in 'The Hobbit' takes place when Bilbo stumbles onto Gollum, and they challenge each other with riddles for possession of the ring. Andy Serkis is superb once more as the creepy Gollum. The best part of 'The Hobbit' occurs in its final hour when our heroes take a ride in the skies and scramble through a set reminiscent of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.' Sadly, what was once magical has lost its luster, and 'The Hobbit' is only half as good as the 'Lord of the Rings' masterpieces.",7,23,48,16 December 2012
Non-Stop," High Flying Action Thriller
","Despite its shoddy CGI shots of a bogus jetliner plunging earthward with two jet fighters flanking it, 'Non-Stop' qualifies as an extremely preposterous but thoroughly entertaining airborne mystery-thriller. At 61-years of age, rugged Liam Neeson stars as troubled U.S. Air Marshal William Marks. Not only has Marks survived the death of his cancer-ridden, adolescent daughter, but he has also experienced a devastating divorce along with the loss of his 25-year job as a New York City Police Department detective. Meantime, the unshaven Marks has deteriorated into a guilt-ridden, nicotine-addicted, alcoholic plagued by memories of his grim past. At one point during this tense as well as terse PG-13-rated melodrama, our hero exposes his clay feet and describes himself as a deplorable dad. A flawed hero usually wins an audience's sympathy, and the scruffy Neeson emerges as an affable enough protagonist with a dark mood or two. He winds up tangling with a homicidal hijacker who has skewered his authority in the eyes of his superiors.Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra of 'Orphan' and rookie writers John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach, and Ryan Engle challenge us with a gallery of unusual suspects when they aren't playing a game of charades with us about the hijacker's identity. Naturally, they dole out red herrings galore to throw us off the scent. Unless you're blessed as a psychic, you may have a difficult time exposing the perpetrator. Cunningly, for the better part of its white-knuckled 106 minutes, Collet-Serra keeps a variety of paranoid passengers bottled up inside the cramped confines of an airliner and kindles sufficient tension within this combustible setting after our hero discovers a ticking time-bomb on board. Rarely does Collet-Serra and company relieve the tension by cross-cutting to exterior scenes of ground personnel until the end. Indeed, you may find yourself feeling a little claustrophobic before an explosive but formulaic finale. Unfortunately, 'Non-Stop' suffers from a dire lack of plausibility, but the filmmakers compensate with a compelling mystery, slickly staged combat action scenes, and a brisk, snappy pace that never lets up. Although neither as gripping as either 'Flightplan' nor as serious as 9/11 hijacking epic'United 93,' 'Non-Stop' generates more than enough suspenseful, edge-0f-the-seat seconds to offset its superficial moments. What it does wrong may be overlooked charitably enough because it is a movie instead of a real-life predicament. Whoever heard of a cop accepting a gun from a man that he doesn't know and then neglecting to see if the firearm is loaded? The cast is strong and does a good job of diverting us from the identity of the hijacker.William Marks isn't having the time of his life as an undercover U.S. Federal Air Marshal when he boards British Aqualantic Flight 10 heading for Heathrow. Initially, he coaxes an anxious little girl aboard the 767 airliner after he recovers the plush toy she left behind. What better way could the filmmakers have aligned our sympathies with the hero than by showing him sticking up for a lonely little girl on her first flight. Ironically, Marks loses it every time the plane that he is guarding takes off. He wraps a ribbon around his hand that once belonged to daughter before she succumbed to cancer. Later, when Flight 10 reaches its half-way point across the Atlantic, suspicious text messages show up on the Marks' secure phone by means of the aircraft's WiFi. Grimly, Marks realizes with mounting dread that his wily, anonymous adversary is undoubtedly a passenger aboard Flight 10. Basically, according to these messages, a person will die every 20 minutes until $150 million is wired to a specific bank account. The big surprise is that the dough lands in Marks' own bank account and his own people on the ground disown him. Eventually, chief pilot Captain David McMillan (Linus Roache of 'Batman Begins') insists that Marks surrender his badge and his automatic pistol. Despite deep misgivings, our unhappy hero complies with the captain's request, but this doesn't discourage him from ferreting out the perpetrator with the help of some passengers,primarily frequent-flyer business woman, Jen Summers (Julianne Moore of 'Carrie') who looks pretty suspicious herself; a balded, NYPD cop (Corey Stroll of ('House of Cards'); former U.S. soldier Tom Bowen (Scoot McNairy of 'Killing Them Softly'), and a kindly Arab, Dr. Fahim Nasir (Omar Metwally of 'Munich'). Along the way, Marks discovers an attaché case packed with cocaine as well as a bomb. By this time, Marks has been thoroughly incriminated as the hijacker thanks to a passenger who has caught some of our hero's questionable actions on video and has somehow wired them to news agencies. The situation grows even worse when Captain McMillan dies inexplicably from poisoning while he is flying the jetliner. Nobody can enter the flight deck where the pilot and co-pilot stay, and this bit of skullduggery really gives Marks as well as the audience something to think about as the seconds to doom tick inexorably ahead.'Non-Stop' doesn't let up until the last minute when all hope seems to be lost not only for the passengers but also our hero. Meantime, little else can be said about this exciting, nerve racking, nail-biter without divulging important plot points. Interestingly enough, Oscar winning '12 Years A Slave' actress Lupita Nyong'o appears in a minor role as one of several flight attendants. Altogether, Liam Neeson fans should be pleased with most of what occurs in 'Non-Stop.'",8,2,4,3 March 2014
The Princess Bride," Fairy Tale Yarn
","'Stand By Me' director Rob Reiner helmed William Goldman's adaptation of his novel 'The Princess Bride' with Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright, and Peter Falk. This imaginative fairy tale about true love is often amusing. A girl falls in love with her servant, but he goes away and is reportedly abducted by pirates. The story is framed by another story about a grandfather who reads a story to his sick grandson (Fred Savage) about a king who wants to marry a girl so he can start a war. Meanwhile, a swordsman (Mandy Patinkin) has spent 20 years searching for the six-fingered gent who slew his father. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright at the star-crossed lovers, and Elwes bears a striking resemblance to Douglas Fairbanks when he dons an outfit in black with a mustache. Billy Crystal has a cameo as a miracle worker. Although it is ostensibly a fairy tale rated PG, 'The Princess Bride' has some gruesome scenes, particularly when sadistic Christopher Guest tortures our hero. Worth watching.",8,2,4,24 February 2014
Saving Private Ryan," The Mission Is The Man!
","Lately, when Hollywood produces war movies, they focus on the debacle of Vietnam. Not director Steven Spielberg! Instead, the incredibly versatile helmer of 'Jaws,' 'Schindler's List,' 'The Color Purple,' and 'Jurassic Park' skewers a patriotic chapter of American history on a bayonet with his graphically realistic but otherwise sappy 'Saving Private Ryan.' 'Saving Private Ryan' ranks as a second-rate World War II movie with a first-class cast and top-notch production values that pass inspection with some of the most savage combat carnage ever lensed. As demeaning as this criticism sounds, 'Saving Private Ryan' is one of the top 25 World War II movies. Since 'Saving Private Ryan' swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action, Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down' and Sylvester Stallone's 'Rambo' have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence. If the story had been as memorable as the kinetic, blood-splattered battle scenes, 'Saving Private Ryan' might have been a classic. Essentially, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a ten-star movie until the U.S. Army gets off the beach and into France where it devolves into just another standard-issue G.I. Joe war epic. Anybody who knows anything about combat movies will cringe the first time that they see the hero parading about in a helmet with the captain's bars painted on the front like a bull's eye. This is an egregious error! During World War II, officers didn't advertise their presence in this manner for fear that an enemy sniper would single them out for a bullet in the head. Okay, I'd dismiss this lapse of realism as a dramatic liberty except that the film itself raises the same point. A seasoned dogface (Vin Diesel) warns a rank amateur to stop saluting the captain for fear that a sniper will shoot the captain down.Dispersed throughout the movie is the usual quota of Hallmark speeches about valor, loyalty, and redemption. These platitudes add little dimension beyond the obvious to the purely physical rat-a-tat-tat. Spielberg could have trimmed much of this sappy dialogue and upgraded his movie. Running nearly three hours in length, this rowdy, often profane World War II melodrama creates a deeper impression with is grotesque special effects than with its drab, sometimes improbable tale. Told from the perspective of the infantry, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a movie in the grand tradition of Louis Milestone's classic 'All Quiet on the Western Front,' Samuel Fuller's 'The Big Red One,' Lewis Milestone's 'A Walk in the Sun,' and William Wellman's 'Background.' Granted, none of them boasts the extreme combat that 'Saving Private Ryan' commands, but they are solidly-made, engaging war movies with deeply personal stories. The muddled but high-minded screenplay by 'Fly Away House' scenarist Robert Rodat follows a unit of U.S. Rangers on a public relations mission to rescue an American paratrooper. Captain Miller assembles a collection of stock characters to help him locate Private James Ryan of Iowa. Ryan (Matt Damon of 'Good Will Hunting') has gotten lost behind enemy lines in the pre-dawn parachute drops that preceded the June 6th D-Day Normandy Invasion. When the War Department discovers that Ryan's two brothers bite the sand at Normandy and that the Japanese have killed a third sibling a week earlier, General George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell of 'Fargo') decides to pull the last Ryan out of action. Along the way, Miller's G.I.s bitch about the irony of risking eight lives to save one guy. Before 'Saving Private Ryan' grinds to its sanguinary conclusion, the Biblical theme of singling out an individual from a multitude for redemption grows tedious. Spielberg and Rodat, along with uncredited scribes Scott Frank and Frank 'The Shawshank Redemption' Darabont, seem confused. Are they making a fiercely repellent anti-war movie? Or have the drummed up a gung-ho Hong Kong style, kick-butt actioneer? They pile on enough violence for a platoon of war movies. Bullets zip and zing by the hundreds giving death an impersonal omnipotence. Presumably, the filmmakers hoped their grisly depiction of combat would eviscerate the memories of those flag-waving John Wayne propaganda sagas. The sadistic horrors that occur in 'Saving Private Ryan' seems more commercially than philosophically oriented. We don't think so much about how terrible war is as how miraculous it is to survive.The first 24 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' dwells on the famous D-Day landing at Omaha Beach. Spielberg shows the baptism by fire that befell the seasick G.I.s as they waded ashore into a murderous Third Reich shooting gallery. This is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics. After the scary, visceral D-Day prologue, the film settles down long enough for Miller to receive new orders. Eventually, Miller locates Ryan with a bunch of paratroopers guarding a bridge behind Nazi lines. Ryan refuses to leave his buddies in the lurch. Reluctantly, Miller and his squad prepare for the worst. This part of 'Saving Private Ryan' has a lot of action, but it cannot compete with the 1960s ABC-TV show 'Combat.' Tom Sizemore makes a credible sergeant, but the usually dependable Edward Burns plays a soldier that would have been shot by his own men for disobeying orders. Tom Hanks' former teacher turned combat leader is a little too sentimental to be believable as is his inevitable demise. Many soldiers have commentedamong them retired Joints Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powellthat Miller and his men should have blown the bridge and retreated. Of course, had our heroes shown this much common sense there would have been no climactic battle.Spielberg relies on elaborate visual gimmicks to strengthen his screen activities. The astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera. The only thing that saves Spielberg is the politically incorrect way that the G.I.s shoot the surrendering Nazi troops. 'Saving Private Ryan,' for all its obvious flaws, still qualifies a movie any die-hard World War II fanatic should watch at least three times.",5,5,10,11 December 2008
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," One of the Best Hollywood Reboots!!!
","This intelligent but imaginative reboot of Twentieth Century Fox's 'Planet of the Apes' franchise is largely entertaining as a science fiction film, but you have to enjoy ersatz computer-generated-imagery for this above-average epic about man versus animal to succeed as a narrative. 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is as much a documentary about primates as it is a melodrama. Since the primates are the focus, no single charismatic human steps up to engage our sympathy as the hero who saves the day. James Franco comes closest as a scientist who looks differently at the apes from start to finish. Initially, the apes amount to little more than numbers to him in a research lab. Later, they become almost human to him. He dresses Caesar in a sweater at one point as if he were a little boy. Nevertheless, the story creates greater sympathy for the primates to make it more compelling, especially during the scene where Bright Eyes goes berserk and storms the board room. The Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver screenplay charts the growth of the primate protagonist from birth to freedom. 'Escapist' director Rupert Wyatt shoots the movie whenever possible from Caesar's perspective as the chimp learns how to behave and then survive not only in captivity but also the wilderness. The filmmakers portray mankind sympathetically in the character of Will Rodman, but also greedy in the character of Will's ambitious supervisor Steven Jacobs. Caesar is not the only primate of interest. Other than Caesar's mother Bright Eyes, Koba is another chimp. While Caesar is treated heroically as the thinking man's' chimp, Koba emerges as a classic villain. Koba comes into his own in 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.' At a biotechnology company named Gen-Sys, research scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) conducts experiments on primates with a serum to cure Alzheimer's disease. After one of the apes runs amuck and the program is shut down. The reluctant lab technician Franklin kills 12 apes, but hands a baby to Rodman to kill. Instead, Rodman takes the chimp home and it exhibits the ability to behave like a child. Eventually, with some much freedom at hand, the chimp named Caesar goes crazy when he sees Will's father, Charles (John Lithgow), being prodded by a man. It seems that Charles left the house, got into a neighbor's car, and cranked it up. Unfortunately, he slams the car into the one parked in front of him. Caesar attacks the neighbor, and Will has to turn him over to an enclosure. A handler at the facility mistreats Caesar. He blasts him with a water cannon and knocks him out. Caesar grows accustomed to life in the San Bruno primate facility and makes friends initially with ex-orangutan circus performer Maurice who exchanges sign language with him.Little by little Caesar establishes himself at the top chimp, steals a pocket knife from a visitor, and learns the number for the punch-pad key lock. Caesar stages an escape and they run to Gen-Sys to join Koba who has been transferred there for testing. After they break out of the Gen-Sys laboratory, they storm the Golden Gate Bridge and havoc ensues. A gorilla leaps into a helicopter where Sheriff's personnel are shooting at the primates on the bridge. Will tries to stop the madness, but he gets there in time to see this mayhem happen. Jacobs, Wills' African-American supervisor who jump started the second phase of primate testing, dies at the hands of Koba in a scene straight out of 'For Your Eyes Only.' Like Bond who pushed a murderer in a car off a cliff to his death, Koba does the same thing for Jacobs in a helicopter and kills him. The primates head to the sanctuary tree-clad mountains. At the conclusion, Will confronts Caesar in the mountains and promises to take him home with him, but he is too late. Caesar pulls a pugnacious Koba off Will and whispers in Will's ear that he is home.This reboot is nothing short of brilliant, and British director Rupert Wyatt relies largely on imagery rather than dialogue to tell the tale. Caesar's first use of the word 'no' is extraordinary as his final words to Rodman in the forest. If you enjoyed the Charlton Heston franchise, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is for you.",9,1,5,16 July 2014
Cars," The Ride of Your Life!!!
","'Toy Story' director John Lasseter has surpassed himself with another classic animated Pixar epic. 'Cars' takes place in the world of competitive automobile racing. Like the 'Toy Story' trilogy and 'A Bug's Life,' 'Cars' occurs in a universe without humankind. Everybody in cars is some model of automobile or an accessory that furnishes help for an automobile. The cars have expressive eyes in their windshields and mouths in their front end grilles. They display a limited ability to gesture with their tires as if the tires were arms. As many as a dozen scribes, among them Joe Ranft, Dan Fogelman, Kiel Murray, Jorgen Klubien, and Phil Lorin, including Lasseter, have concocted a thoroughly entertaining romp in the NASCAR like circuit about antics of an independent but immature rookie race car named Lightning MacQueen. Clearly, our impulsive hero draws his name from immortal cinematic speedster Steve McQueen. The story follows the arc of Lightning's life from the moment that he arrives on the scene as a race car champ until he learns some of life's important lessons. Primarily, Lightning will grow to appreciate the meaning of friendship. 'Cars' belongs to that category of sports movies about a callow protagonist who learns the painful lesson that winning isn't everything. Somewhere along the road, Lightning has to sniff the roses and acquire values that eclipse those feelings of lone-wolf selfishness. Lightning (voice of Owen Wilson) makes a spectacular debut on the asphalt. At the same time, he alienates his crew chief and makes the mistake of not swapping out tires when he is ahead of everybody else, including the racing legend known as 'the King' (real-life racer Richard Petty)challenges Lightning at every turn. Miraculously, Lightning crosses the finish line in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup Championship. The other two cars that make it to the finish with him are the King and an obnoxious race car named Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). Racing authorities decide to stage one more race to determine who is really the best. Lightning is in such a hurry to get to California that he makes his eighteen wheeler buddy who hauls him around to drive late into the evening. During this long, late night haul, Mack the eighteen wheeler (John Ratzenberger) loses Lightning when its back-end disengages and our sleeping hero rolls out into on-coming traffic. Lightning has to dodge and swerve other autos and eighteen wheelers. Inadvertently, in his desperate efforts to catch up with Mack, Lightning takes a turn for the worst and winds up in the remote and largely forgotten town of Radiator Springs. Radiator Springs used to be on the main highway until the Interstate 40 bypass was constructed. Now the little town in the middle of the desert is slowly drying up. When Lightning roars into town, he is racing ninety to nothing to escape from a policeman. He gets tangled up in barbed wire and a statue and ends up destroying the asphalt-paved thoroughfare. After our hero spends the night in the impound lot, he has his day in court. The town fathers—again a motley collection of cars—sentence Lightning to resurfacing the road. Although Lightning explains the urgency of his trip, the Radiator Springs authorities are just a little smarter than he is. The virtually friendless Lightning gradually makes friends, the best friend of the bunch is a tow truck operator called Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy)who follows Lightning's every move. Eventually, Lightning meets Sally Carrera, (Bonnie Hunt) a Porsche and they hit it off. She explains that she was once an attorney in Los Angeles who broke down in Radiator Springs and discovered the beauty of such an isolated town. Lightning labors under the misguided belief that he knows everything there is to know about race car driving until he meets Doc. Doc (voice of Paul Newman) is an old Hudson that won several Piston Cup awards, but an accident put him out of the racing business. Doc is reluctant to teach Lightning those life lessons that everybody needs to know to survive. The animation is top-notch and occasionally could pass for the real thing. No, the talking cars never look human enough so that you don't notice that they are automobiles. Nevertheless, Lasseter and his scenarists have forged many interesting characters and given them some insightful dialogue. The humor is hilarious, especially the tractor tipping scene where Lightning and Mater sneak out to a farm late at night to scare sleeping tractors. The tractors here are the equivalent of cows. Clocking in a 116 minutes, 'Cars' never runs out a humor and excitement. Adults will enjoy this opus about anthropomorphized automobiles much as adolescents because the writing doesn't stoop to conquer.",9,0,1,28 June 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," One of Marvel's Best Adventures!!!
","Disney's latest Marvel Studios' blockbuster superhero epic 'Avengers: Infinity War' finally gives us a villain we not only can love but also loath with equal passion because he considers himself the epitome of mercy. Few supervillains share Thanos' warped point of view as well as his staggering supremacy. After several cameos in earlier Marvel epics, the long-awaited Thanos devastates everybody and everything in his path like an apocalypse. Just about every Marvel superhero shows up to hamper this doomsday juggernaut from looting the universe for those six ultra-powerful Infinity Stones that auger ill for the future. 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' and 'Captain America: Civil War' co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and 'Captain America' co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have delivered a sequel that indisputably surpasses its predecessors, but it is debatable that Marvel can elevate the stakes much higher in later sequels for a villain as formidable as Thanos. Moreover, the greatest criticism many may raise is that their favorite Marvel superhero may have been short changed in this saga owing to a lack of time to streamline everybody into the storyline. Actually, most of the superheroes have more than enough time, while the peripheral entities, like Loki, perish in the first scene and those that ensue. Clocking in at a marathon two hours and 36 minutes, 'Avengers: Infinity War' will challenge anybody's bladder. Unless you're a dialysis patient, you'll have to schedule your departures, so you'll miss either the least amount of high-octane action or expository dialogue. Back in the good ole days, Hollywood provided audiences with intermissions to purge their urges. Problem is the brothers Russo and their scenarists never squander a second in their narrative. Perhaps somebody will create an app that will enable us via Wi-Fi to watch on our smart phones what will would normally miss during flights to and from the lavatory. Meantime, the Russo Brothers maintain a straightforward, serious tone throughout this superhero mash-up, sprinkling the action with amusing quips, especially about Wakanda possibly getting a Starbucks Coffee Shop since Black Panther wants to open his homeland up to the world. No, 'Avengers Infinity War' isn't a parody like 'Thor: Ragnarok.' Despite its abundant length, the filmmakers take enough time to update certain characters, such as Thor, and give us glimpses into the past about how Thanos saved a young Gamora. What may dishearten some Marvel fans is Thanos doesn't take a licking. Instead, he delivers the licking, taking down virtually every Marvel champion as irrevocably as a bowling ball smashing ten-pins during a strike. 'Avengers' Infinity War' picks up where 'Thor: Ragnarok' left off. Thanos (Josh Brolin) boards the Asgardian spaceship with the Ragnarok survivors. Incidentally, he wears a helmet and uniform in a nod to Jim Starlin's graphic novel 'The Infinity Gauntlet' (1991). He wears a massive gauntlet on his left fist that will eventually be encrusted with six stones. Thanos sheds the helmet. He vanquishes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) in brief but brutal combat. He tortures Thor for the whereabouts of the Tesseract, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) reluctantly surrenders it. Not only does Thanos dispatch Loki but also Heimdall. Before Heimdall (Idris Elba) dies, he summons the Bifrost and hurtles Hulk back to Earth. Once he possesses the Space stone, Thanos destroys the ship. Meantime, Hulk plunges into New York City. He has reverted to Bruce Banner. Worst, he cannot conjure up the Hulk. Thanos' cronies invade New York. They hover above the Big Apple in a colossal ring-shaped spacecraft. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is riding in a school bus, driven by Marvel honcho Stan Lee in his inevitable cameo, when this monstrosity appears over Manhattan. Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-man, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) tangle with these sinister extraterrestrials that want Strange's Time stone. Eventually, our superheroes stow away onboard the departing alien ship, and Spider-man discovers that his new suit helps him survive. More of Thanos' toadies rampage into Scotland to bring back the Mind stone embedded in Vision's forehead. Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) fights alongside Vision (Paul Bettany) to repulse these wicked adversaries. In a riff on the rescue mission in 'Alien,' the Guardians of the Galaxy receive a distress call. When they reach the scene of the destruction, they can only save Thor. The Guardians split into two groups, and Rocket Raccoon and Groot accompany Thor to the planet Nidavellir, where Eitri (Peter Dinklage) forges a replacement battle-axe christened Stormbreaker, so the son of Odin can intervene in a life-and-death fracas back on Earth in Wakanda. Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) confront more of Thanos' subhuman armies out to get 'the Mind Stone.' The creation of Thor's new hammer is exhilarating stuff. No matter what this army of superheroes does, Thanos manages to subjugate them at every turn. Eventually, once he has acquired all six stones, the Titan snaps his fingers, and half of the universe expires like dust in the wind. Barnes, Black Panther, Groot, Scarlet Witch, Mantis, Drax, Star Lord, Dr. Strange, and Spider-man dissolve into smoke. At one point, our heroes nearly relieve Thanos of the Infinity gauntlet, until Star Lord infuriates the purple giant. Ultimately, Iron Man, Thor, Banner, Rocket Raccoon, Captain America, and Black Widow survive this frightening Armageddon.Anybody familiar with Jim Starlin's 'The Infinity Gauntlet,' the film's ostensible source material, knows the graphic novel and film share few similarities. For example, in the Starlin's 'Gauntlet,' Thanos has acquired all six infinity gems from the start. Conversely, in the movie, Thanos embarks on a scavenger hunt for these essential crystals. The film jettisons Thanos' futile infatuation with Mistress Death. More than thirty superheroes wind up on casualty list, and the Earth is catapulted out of orbit. Nevertheless, everything that Thanos did was undone. The biggest surprise about 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the triumph of Thanos over the heroes. Presumably, the sequel will undo the evil Titan's victory.",10,3,8,24 May 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Landmark Film in Ku Fung Cinema, Unforgettable, Brilliant!!!
","'Sense and Sensibility' director Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' has achieved what no other 19th century Hong Kong martial arts costume epic has ever accomplished in the history of motion pictures. Not only did action fantasy rake in big bucks at the box office, but it also racked up dozens of cinematic awards, including four Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Original Score, and Best Foreign Language film, in addition to being nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. Lenser Peter Pau walked off with four awards for his marvelous cinematography, and Hong Kong critics honored Woo-ping Yuen for Best Choreography as well as Best Picture, Best Cinematography, and Best Director. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is surely the most honored martial arts masterpiece of all time, at least for the time being and combines art-house prestige with plain, old-fashioned, slam-bang, kick-butt melodrama. Moreover, in America, Ang Lee has succeeded with his critically acclaimed film of presenting the dialogue in original Mandarin language so that audiences had to contend with subtitles. Traditionally, American audiences shun subtitles, but 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' changed that with its unqualified success. Happily, the subtitles rarely exceed two sentences.Veteran fight choreographer Woo-Ping Yuen of 'The Matrix' complements Ang Lee's quiet but compelling dialogue scenes with several incredibly kinetic, gravity-defying combat sequences staged with warriors dashing up walls, gliding across rooftops, and clashing swords atop towering bamboo trees. These eye-popping acrobatics enhance an intricately woven yarn about love, honor, intrigue, gender-reversal, and revenge. Ten years ago hyperkinetic antics such as these would have been greeted with derision. Indeed, not sense the Bruce Lee actioneer 'Enter the Dragon' has a Chinese-language, martial arts film been heralded with so many honors and changed the attitudes of Americans.Starring Chow Yuen Fat of 'The Replacement Killers,' and Michele Yeoh of 'Tomorrow Never Dies,' 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' qualifies as a bittersweet but transcendental kung fu spectacle set during the Qing Dynasty. Scenarists James 'Ride with the Devil' Schamus and Tsai Kuo Jung based their screenplay on Wang Du Lu's romantic novel about the tragedy that dooms two ill-fated couples when a thief steals a 400-year old sword called 'the Green Destiny.' Initially, invincible Wudan swordsman Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) renounces the warrior's life. Basically, all Li Mu wants is to hang up his sword and settle down with Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), a fearless kung fu fighter once betrothed to Li's late brother. Each repress the heartfelt love smoldering between them to honor the memory of his slain brother. Visiting Shu Lien, Li entrusts her with delivering his legendary sword to Sir Te (Sihung Lung), an elder who helped them.Meanwhile, the provincial governor's daughter, Jen (Zhang Ziyi of 'Rush Hour 2'), reluctantly prepares for an arranged marriage. She admires Shu Lien and envies her maverick lifestyle. Jen neither wants to wed nor has gotten over a torrid love affair with Dark Cloud (Chang Chen), a charismatic desert brigand. No sooner has Shu Lien presented the sword to Sir Te than a masked intruder filches it. Shu Lien pursues the elusive larcenist up the sides of walls in a futile effort to nab the thief, but loses the villain in the darkness. Eventually, Li returns and teams up with her to recover the sword. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' ponders the meeting of true happiness. Tempestuous Jen argues you can only attain Shangri-La when you choose who you love and what you want! Pictorially, 'Tiger' boasts spectacular photography of the Forbidden City as well as the parched grandeur of the Gobi Desert. Longtime Kung Fu Cinema fans will hail the hair-raising heroics, while ardent feminists will applaud the strong, independent women that defy the traditional roles. Ultimately, nobody finds true happiness, except for the audience. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' ranks as a landmark kung fu film.",10,1,2,29 May 2008
Gone Girl," Nothing Short of Superb!!!
","Watching David Fincher's deliriously tantalizing whodunit 'Gone Girl,' a melodrama about a troubled married couple wrestling with compatibility issues, reminded me of the film classic 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' (1946) co-starring Lana Turner and John Garfield. Turner and Garfield played illicit lovers who arranged the murder of Lana's elderly husband so Garfield and she could indulge their lust. Eventually, each had second thoughts, and murder reared its ugly head. In 'Gone Girl,' Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike experience somewhat similar woes. They are cast as a husband and wife who have lost their jobs and find their marriage unraveling with ugly ramifications. They embark on a nerve-racking odyssey through Hell with more outlandish things happening to them than you can possibly imagine—unless you've read the novel. 'Gone Girl' constitutes another Hollywood adaptation of a runaway bestseller. Happily, for a change, director David Fincher hired bestselling author Gilliam Flynn to adapt her own work. Yes, I've perused Flynn's masterpiece, and she has exercised good taste and judgment in modifying her compulsive page-turner for the screen. Basically, this Twentieth Century Fox film release is about as faithful as any movie can be to its source material. Minor changes occur, and some characters have been eliminated. Nevertheless, nothing substantial has been altered. In other words, if you loved the novel, you won't hate what Fincher and Flynn have done with it. As much as I enjoyed 'Gone Girl,' I'll concede the novel is slightly better than the film. Principally, Flynn cannot translate to the screen the depths of Amy's subversive thoughts. Meantime, Fincher has done an admirable job of orchestrating the 'he said; she said' shenanigans of husband and wife. Mind you, 'Gone Girl' qualifies as more than just a spine-tingling exercise in suspense and tension where the authorities believe the husband is the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance. This movie succeeds on multiple levels as Fincher and Flynn skewer gender politics, scandal-mongering television news personalities, marriage dynamics, and essentially society in general.Nick (Ben Affleck of 'Argo') and Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike of 'Die Another Day') are a sophisticated New York couple who lost their jobs as a result of the recession. When his mother is diagnosed with cancer, Nick persuades Amy to forsake her elegant brownstone in New York City, and they relocate to his North Carthage, Missouri, hometown. Amy buys Nick a tavern called 'The Bar' with her trust fund to keep him busy, and Nick's twin sister Margo Dunne (Broadway actress Carrie Coon) helps manage it. Meantime, Nick and Amy's marriage steadily erodes as trust issues and power dynamics exert a toll on it. A life-long city dweller, Amy feels miserably out of place in a small town in the middle of Heartland America with too little to occupy her imagination. She doesn't adapt as well to this dire change of scenery as her husband. As the morning of their fifth anniversary dawns, Nick leaves Amy at home and cruises into town to check up on his sister at the bar. No sooner has Nick gotten there and swapped shots with Margo than a neighbor calls Nick and informs him that his front door is standing mysteriously wide open. Rushing home, Nick finds pieces of furniture either smashed or overturned in the living room. Amy is nowhere in sight. Nick alerts the authorities. North Carthage Police Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickins of TV's 'Lost') and Officer Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit of 'Almost Famous') comb the premises and collect clues. Later, the North Carthage crime scene crew uncovers evidence of a huge blood puddle in the kitchen that had been sloppily mopped up. Repeatedly, Nick swears his innocence, but things spiral hopelessly out of control. He learns from the police that Amy was pregnant. Ultimately, in an act of sheer desperation, Nick hires celebrity lawyer, Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry of 'Alex Cross'), to defend him. Worst, the jealous college girl with whom Nick was having an affair exposes their adultery on prime-time television. Although the detectives have amassed an abundance of evidence implicating Nick, Boney and Gilpin have no luck finding Amy's body.You could watch 'Gone Girl' a dozen times and come away with something memorable each time. Fincher has fashioned a tense thriller just as immaculate and flawless as his best movies, including 'Fight Club,' 'The Game,' 'The Social Network,' and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' Affleck is at the top of his game as the gullible husband with something to conceal, while Pike deserves an Oscar for the many faces that she forges as Nick's long, lost Amy. Neal Patrick Harris displays his chameleon ability to play a cross-section of characters. He emerges as one of Amy's warped lovers who once stalked her. Clocking in at virtually two hours and half, 'Gone Girl' defies expectations—unless you're conversant with the novel. Just when you think you've got everything figured out, Fincher and Flynn twist another loop into their Gordian knot of a narrative. The effect is similar to being spun around about every half-hour and gaping at the experience. Beware, 'Gone Girl' boasts a blood-soaked murder scene that is rather graphic, but this thriller remains extremely literate. Anybody who abhors HLN 'victim's rights' advocate Nancy Grace is going to appreciate the pompous character of Ellen Abbott who goes after Nick's scalp after Amy vanishes. Tyler Perry plays it straight as Nick's high-profile attorney Tanner Bolt who coaches him throughout the ordeal. In one scene, Tanner prepares his client for an important television interview. Each time Nick answers a question with either an inappropriate tone or expression, Tanner bombards him with jelly beans. Anybody who has ever complained about Ben Affleck's smug pretty boy persona will love this scene. As much as I would love to divulge some of the juicier scenes in 'Gone Girl,' I cannot without spoiling the outcome. If you love husband and wife murder movies or murder melodramas altogether, 'Gone Girl' shouldn't disappoint you.",10,4,16,4 November 2014
Django Unchained," Tolerably Entertaining
","Quentin Tarantino's antebellum western 'Django Unchained' is far more palatable than his appalling World War II epic 'Inglourious Basterds.' Nevertheless, Tarantino adopts a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward 'the peculiar institution,' while he sets a new record for the number of times the politically incorrect N-word is used. The saving grace of 'Django Unchained' is nobody behaves as clownishly as Brad Pitt did in 'Inglourious Basterds.' Meaning, aside from its gratuitously-violent, revenge-fueled narrative, 'Django Unchained' qualifies as a fair to middling horse opera that pays greater tribute to Fred Williamson's Blaxploitation westerns than Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti westerns. Tarantino depicts southern plantation owners contemptuously as sadistic stooges along with anybody who conspires with them--whatever their pigmentation. Few surprises occur during its marathon 165-minutes. The absence of Tarantino's long-time editor Sally Menke, who died in 2010 from heat stroke, may account for this meandering melodrama. The first hour should have been seriously trimmed, but it provides you with adequate opportunities to contend with super-sized soda drinks. Sadly, 'Django Unchained' generates little excitement until Leonardo DiCaprio enlivens things with his presence. He makes his character's obsession with phrenology appear frightening genuine. You know that he is a villain because he smokes too much. Tarantino stages one long, blood-splattered shoot-out that looks like a homage to 'Saving Private Ryan.' This kind of exaggerated violence will make the squeamish cower. Conversely, gore hounds will admire the abundant use of exploding computer-generated body parts.A German dentist who masquerades as a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz), purchases a woebegone slave, Django (Jamie Fox of 'Miami Vice'), from a pair of shotgun-wielding slave traders. Schultz kills one slaver, shoots the other slaver's horse so the fallen animal traps its' rider, and then releases the other slaves so they have their way with the pinned slaver. Schultz has been searching for Django. It seems Schultz wants to collect the bounty on the Brittle Brothers. Trouble is Schultz has never laid eyes on the Brittles so he wouldn't recognize the three of them if he saw them. He buys Django so the African-American can spot them for him. After they track the Brittles down to Big Daddy's plantation and kill them, Schultz makes Django his partner. They arouse comments wherever they go because Django rides a horse. Whites weren't accustomed to seeing a black man astride a horse. Meantime, Django perfects his speed and accuracy with a six-gun until he can draw, fire, and hit the bull's eye it in one fluid motion. He tells Schultz about his slave wife and resolves to be reunited with her. Schultz traces Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) to a plantation called Candieland. Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio of 'Titanic') owns Candieland and enjoys gambling on his African American Mandingo wrestlers. Schultz and Django pose as buyers searching for a good Mandingo fighter to buy. They are willing to pay $12-thousand for one of Candie's fighters. Candie invites them to his plantation. Along the way, our heroes watch Candie punish one of his runaway slaves. He turns several dogs loose on the unfortunate slave and the dogs tear him apart. Afterward, everything goes as planned for our heroes until Candie's oldest servant, head house slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Pulp Fiction'), suspects the two aren't interested in slave fighters as much as they are in Broomhilda. At that point, all Hades breaks loose with shooting and killing galore.Little of this so-called tribute to Spaghetti westerns resembles a Spaghetti western. Indeed, Tarantino didn't lens the action in either Spain or Italy, and only rarely does the scenery look as spectacular as the scenery in a European western. Basically, three things qualify this as a Spaghetti western tribute film. First, original 'Django' star Franco Nero makes a cameo in the second hour where he assures our African-American hero that he knows the D in Django is silent. Second, Tarantino appropriates music from several Spaghetti westerns, not only 'Django,' but also 'Day of Anger' and 'They Call Me Trinity.' Purists will also recognize music from the Clint Eastwood western 'Two Mules from Sister Sara' and the Rock Hudson World War II movie 'Hornets Nest.' Third, Tarantino tries to imitate the popular zooms that were rampant during the 1970s. Incidentally, the zooms in 'Django Unchained' barely resemble those zooms from long shots to close-ups so prevalent in Continental westerns and crime thrillers. Comparatively, few Spaghetti westerns were as gory as 'Django Unchained.' The big plantation shoot-out looks like something derived from Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch.' Instead, 'Django Unchained' looks more like a Blaxploitation western along the lines of the 1972 Fred Williamson western 'The Legend of N***er Charley.' The cast for the most part acquit themselves admirably. Not surprisingly, Tarantino hasn't learned yet that his talents remain behind the camera rather than in front of it. Cast as an African-American slave turned bounty hunter, Jamie Fox maintains a straight face throughout the action, and Christopher Waltz oozes ingratiating charm as the older hero who teaches the younger hero how to be heroic. This is a standard-issue plot line in westerns. On the other hand, Leonardo DiCaprio virtually chews the scenery as plantation owner Calvin Candie. Samuel L. Jackson lands the juiciest role as a suspicious Uncle Tom house slave who has Calvin's ear. Tarantino's dialogue seemed on the weak side, too. Nothing here struck me as remotely quotable. This time around Tarantino employs lots of familiar faces, but few are featured in primary roles. If you look closely, you'll recognize Bruce Dern, Tom Wopat, Michael Parks, Robert Carradine, and Lee Horsley in minor supporting roles. 'Miami Vice' star Don Johnson and 'Breaking Away' lead Dennis Christopher get more screen time than their colleagues from yesteryear. The only really funny scene involves Big Daddy's vigilantes as they struggle to see through their crudely cut-out white bags that they wear over their heads. Altogether, considering the wealth of material Tarantino appropriated, 'Django Unchained' amounts to a missed opportunity.",5,45,86,29 December 2012
Get Out," An intelligent, sophisticated, Neo-Blaxploitation, horror chiller
","Comedian Jordan Peele of 'Keanu' has made an auspicious directorial debut with 'Get Out,' an intelligent, sophisticated, Neo-Blaxploitation, horror chiller with far fewer buckets of blood than a conventional Eli Roth splatter-fest like either 'Hostel' or 'Green Inferno.' Two-thirds a suspenseful psychological cat & mouse melodrama and one-third a frightening foray into homicidal histronics, 'Get Out' benefits from Peele's admirable restraint and his levelheaded helming. Gradually, he peels back the layers of his 'Twilight Zone' tale like an onion to reveal the alarming revelations that skulk at the soul of this sinister movie. Taking their cues from Mary Shelley's Baron Victor Frankenstein, the white villains perpetuate racism like you have never experienced. Fortunately, Peele incorporates some welcome comic relief to lighten matters. Meantime, he maintains the tension throughout until he brings everything to a tantalizing boil, and this bizarre yarn erupts with violence. During its nimble running time of 103 minutes, Peele presents an enormous number of baffling details the significance of which seem evasive until everything culminates in a slam-bang ending guaranteed to surprise and mortify. Furthermore, apart from the dynamic Catherine Keener and hilarious stand-up comic Lil Rel Howery, Peele has assembled a thoroughly convincing cast of character actors who appreciate the subtlety of his low-key approach and mirror it with their straight-faced performances. Essentially, Peele has appropriated the two Hollywood classics 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' (1967) and 'The Stepford Wives' (1975) as the template for 'Get Out!' A white female has been dating an African-American, and she decides to take him home to meet her mom and pop. Initially nervous about his forthcoming encounter with her liberal parents, the boyfriend discovers that nothing is what it appears. The solitary shortcoming of 'Get Out!' that qualifies it as Neo-Blaxploitation is the conspicuous absence of any sympathetic white characters. Every Caucasian emerges as utterly repellent, while the African-Americans are saintly victims.Twentysomething African-American photographer Chris Washington (British actor Daniel Kaluuya of 'Welcome to the Punch') has been dating his Caucasian sweetheart Rose Armitage (Allison Williams of 'College Musical') for almost five months. At this point in their budding relationship, Rose wants to introduce Chris to her parents at their remote country estate. Chris asks Rose if she has told Missy (Catherine Keener of 'Captain Phillips') and Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford of 'Awakenings') that he is African-American. Rose assures Chris that he need not concern himself about such trivial matters. She explains her father would have voted for Obama a third time. Later, after Chris has met the Armitages, Dean mentions that he would have voted a third time for Obama. Dean makes a buffoon of himself with his colorblind approach and his ludicrous use of boilerplate African-American slang. Rose's parents embrace Chris as a future son-in-law, but he doesn't feel comfortable around either their brawny African-American handyman, Walter (Marcus Henderson of 'Whiplash'), or Georgina (Betty Gabriel of 'The Purge: Election Year'), their absent-minded housekeeper. Missy explains that her parents hired Walter and Georgia to relieve them of the onerous tasks that old age had prevented them from performing. Chris interrupts Walter one afternoon while the latter is industriously chopping wood. Walter doesn't use, Chris notices, customary African-American slang. Meantime, Chris feels like an object under scrutiny. Rose's parents notice him drumming his fingers across the dining table at lunch. Reluctantly, Chris admits that he smokes cigarettes, but has been struggling to quit. Dean informs him that not only is Missy is an accomplished hypnotherapist, but that she can also cure him in a snap of her fingers. Chris learns that Dean is a neurosurgeon, too. During their conversation, Rose's parents remind their daughter about their annual party that they are hosting for their friends during the weekend. Rose acts like she has completely forgotten about it. The last Armitage to arrive is Rose's confrontational, half-witted brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones of 'Contraband') who wants to impress Chris with his Jujitsu tactics.Chris roams around the Armitage estate clicking pictures. Georgina behaves awkwardly as she observes him from afar. Apart from a token Asian at the party, the Armitage guests are primarily affluent but elderly Caucasians. Incredibly, Chris spots an elderly woman accompanied by a slim, twentysomething African-American guy, Andrew Logan King (Lakeith Stanfield of 'Straight Outta Compton'), who appears like a fish-out-0f-water. Stealthily, Chris snaps a photo of him with his cell phone. Unfortunately, the flash discombobulates King, and he shouts the words 'Get Out' at Chris. Now more than ever, his curiosity fully aroused, Chris sends his best friend, Rod Williams (comedian Lil Rel Howery of 'Get a Job'), the photo of King. A conspiracy theorist as well as TSA agent, Rod has suspected all along that Rose wants to turn Chris into a sex slave. Before he left with Rose, Chris entrusted Rod with the upkeep of his apartment back in the city and the care of his pet dog. Eventually, Missy corners Chris late one evening and hypnotizes him simply by stirring her coffee cup. Suddenly, and this is when things really get twisted, Chris finds himself plunging into the floor under Missy's spell. As he drifts into what appears to be an abyss, Missy points out to Chris that he has entered 'the sunken zone.' Afterward, nothing is the same for our paranoid protagonist who awakens the following dawn without the urge to ignite tobacco.'Get Out' derives its title from the shouts audiences scream at horror movies when they urge either an individual or individuals on screen to get the Hades out of a hostile environment as the forces of horror converge like a spider poised to administer its death venom to its web-entangled quarry. Indeed, more is skulking ghoulishly behind the scenes in 'Get Out' than the humble, unsuspecting Chris can imagine in his wildest dreams. Peele loosens all restraints during the final twenty minutes, and everything horrific is exposed. The Armitage clan amount to a bigoted bunch of butchers with more than lobotomy on their minds.",9,6,17,9 March 2017
Drive," Automotive Shoot'em Up
","'Bronson' director Nicolas Winding Refn's crime thriller 'Drive' concerns a guy who works during the day as a Hollywood stunt car driver when he isn't an accomplice in robberies as a getaway driver. Comparisons between this Ryan Gosling epic and Jason Statham's 'Transporter' franchise are inevitable. The chief difference is 'Driver' is far more realistic, with up close and personal violence, that people don't walk away from except for a miracle. This R-rated, white-knuckled, urban melodrama shows men getting stabbed repeatedly with forks, rammed by automobiles during high speed chases, and slashed mercifully with straight razors. Things progressively grow worse for everybody in this grim account of cry doesn't pay. The hero is a taciturn fellow who knows how to drive like a bat out of hell. He can roll cars, outwit cops, and cruise backwards, but he doesn't use a gun. One day he notices another woman who lives in the same apartment building where he lives. Moreover, Irene (Carey Mulligan of 'Brothers') has a young son, Benicio (Jeff Wolfe) and her husband, Standard Gabriel (Guatemalan actor Oscar Isaac of 'Sucker Punch'), is just getting released from prison. Driver (Ryan Gosling of 'Fracture') takes an interest in Irene before he learns that she is married. After her husband gets out of prison, he approaches Driver about a robbery in the valley of a pawnshop. Standard needs this robbery so he can pay back the dastards who have run him into debt. The trouble is that they are going to double-cross him. They involve a woman, Blanche (Christina Hendricks of 'Detachment'), who knows that they will be robbed after the robbery takes place. Mind you, nobody breathes a word of double-cross to our protagonist. He is startled when he sees Standard gunned down before his very eyes. Complicating matters is the Driver's crippled friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston of TV's 'Breaking Bad') who persuades Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks of 'Taxi Driver') to furnish him $300-thousand dollars so he can overhaul a car and get Driver to race it. As it turns out, Bernie's accomplice is a temperamental Jewish entrepreneur, Nino (Ron Perlman of 'Hellboy'), is behind the caper that our heroes were working on when all hell broke loose. Eventually, our hero learns who he is and rams his limo so it topples off a beach. Nino tries to elude Driver, but our protagonist follows him into the surf and drowns him. Meantime, Bernie slashes Shannon's forearm and the Driver's boss bleeds to death. Bernie arranges a meeting with Driver at an Asian restaurant where he dictates the terms of their resolution. Bernie promises not to hurt the woman, but he advises the Driver to look over his shoulder at all time as a consequence of this debacle. Bernie surprises Driver and stabs him in the stomach. Driver cuts Bernie's throat and leaves his corpse in the parking lot.Everything that can go wrong does go wrong in 'Driver.' Albert Brooks, who made a name for himself as a comedian in films in the 1980s and 1990s, is cast against type as a ruthless killer who slays without a qualm. Squeamish spectators may flinch at all the close-quarters violence, like a woman getting the top of her head blown off with a shotgun. To his credit, director Nicolas Winding Refn refrains from glamorizing violence. 'Drive' was lensed around Los Angeles, and lenser Newton Thomas Sigel makes the city of Angels look cool. Gosling gives a strong performance as the criminal hero.",7,1,2,25 February 2013
Insidious," Subtle But Spooky Saga
","Subtle and spooky go together like spiders and cobwebs in Malaysian director James Wan's psychic chiller 'Insidious.' This imaginative yarn deals with haunted houses, astral demons, and the out-of-body abduction of an adolescent. Wan and his screen writing partner Leigh Whannell, who collaborated as director and writer on 'Saw,' and 'Dead Silence,' have retreated from the obvious, literal world of 'Saw' and plunged into the nightmarish oblivion of the Further. 'Paranormal Activity' producers Jason Blum, Steven Schneider, and Oriel Peli have fashioned another one of those horror movies that doesn't seem scary. Nobody gets butchered by a maniac and wallows in a pool of blood created by severed limbs and legs. Nevertheless, 'Insidious' is all the more terrifying for its refusal to indulge in gore. Astral projection lies at the heart of this creepy, 102-minute, PG-13 opus. Astral projection is an out-of-body experience, such as when people die but survive and return to talk about their brief journey into the void. The worst thing that you can expect from 'Insidious' is the appearance of otherworldly individuals who slip up behind our young married couple and generally create chaos in their house. Things take a turn for the worst when Renai (Rose Byrne of 'Bridemaids') and Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson of 'Watchmen') move into another house. Renai convinced Josh to move them from an older house to a new house after a series of eerie events occurred that made her skin crawl. One of their two sons, Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins), ventured into the attic of the older house, climbed a ladder, and then fell from it. The following day, when Josh tried to awaken Dalton in the morning to get him ready for school, he got no response. The baffled doctors believe that Dalton has sunk into a coma, but Josh's mother, Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey of 'Beaches'), suspects something more sinister. Lorriane brings one of her oldest friends, Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye of '2001 Maniacs'), over to visit with them. Initially, a pair of paranormal technicians, Specs (Leigh Whannell of 'Saw') and Tucker (Angus Sampson) appear with an arsenal of exotic equipment to make sure that Josh and Renai aren't nut jobs. After Tucker spots a couple of ladies clad in white in a hall way, he assures Specs that it is time to summon Elise. to assist her. Eventually, we learn that Josh is an astral traveler, and Elise dispatches him to find his son in what she calls 'the Further.' Wan relies on sympathetic performances, upsetting music, and surprises to keep 'Insidious' interesting. The unsavory but interesting conclusion comes as a jarring shock. Nevertheless, 'Insidious' qualifies as a neat but effective white-knuckled exercise in suspense.",7,0,1,12 September 2013
Bolt," 'Bolt' Is Movie To Bark About . . .
","The new animated 3-D Walt Disney family flick 'Bolt' is pretty doggone funny. Combine elements of the Arnold Schwarzenegger epic 'Last Action Hero' (1993) with the dogs trekking across America in the 1963 Disney classic 'The Incredible Journey,' and you'll have a fair idea about what this cute canine comedy delivers. 'Bolt' is the first Disney animated feature produced by the Mouse House since Pixar genius John Lasseter of 'Toy Story' fame assumed creative control. Like previous Lasseter movies, such as 'Cars,' 'A Bug's Life,' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' the animation in 'Bolt' is something to bark about. The incomparable 3-D digital projection is what distinguishes this lighthearted flick. Meanwhile, 'Mulan' co-scripters Byron Howard and Chris Williams, who teamed up to helm this hilarious hokum, drum up a lot of jokes about a deluded doggie who dreams that he possesses super heroic powers. 'Pulp Fiction' star John Travolta furnishes the voice for the feisty German shepherd puppy, and Disney singing sensation Miley Cyrus voices Penny, the teenager who adores Bolt at first sight when she spots the little nipper at an animal shelter.The premise of 'Bolt' is as fetching as it is far-fetched. Boltcomplete with a jagged lightning insignia across his ribsbecomes the top dog of a prime-time, Google Generation, sci-fi TV show. The contemporary equivalent of Lassie, our four-pawed protagonist shows no fear in a crisis. In the context of the show, Penny desperately searches for her father who has been abducted by an evil Bond-type villain, Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell of 'A Clockwork Orange'), flanked by two haughty cats. Before Penny's poppa got kidnapped, he enhanced Bolt with cybernetic powers that make this man's best friend as powerful as Will Smith's 'Hancock.' Bolt's prime directive is to protect his 'person,' Penny (Miley Cyrus of 'Hannah Montana'), from Dr. Calico's black-clad henchmen. Bolt is so strong that he can smash head-first into a car and send it spinning end-over-end 50 yards in the air. He can turn eyes into molten lasers and burn through anything. Furthermore, he can hightail it down a street faster than a greyhound on afterburners and leap above a hovering helicopter's whirling rotor blades! In reality, however, Bolt is nothing more than an average bow-wow. Network TV executives have fooled our hero into thinking that he has cybernetically enhanced brawn. After Bolt has dealt with the villains and gone back to his trailer, the technicians step in and remove the debris. The dead and the wounded get up and brush themselves off. Network executives refuse to let Bolt out of his trailer for fear that he will discover the truth about himself. Nothing Bolt does is real; it's the result of carefully staged special effects. You can see the resemblance between Bolt and the 'Toy Story' character Buzz Lightyear. Everything changes radically for Bolt when two sarcastic cats lure him out of his trailer. During a frantic chase, Bolt traps himself accidentally in a box of pink Styrofoam that is shipped off to New York City. In the Big Apple, three moronic pigeons lead Bolt to a cynical, declawed, black alley cat, Mittens (Susie Essman of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'), and our deluded hero takes her hostage so that he can find Penny. Leashed together like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier were in the 1958 civil rights thriller 'The Defiant Ones,' Bolt drags a reluctant Mittens across America to Hollywood. Along the way, Bolt realizes that he is an ordinary mutt. He succumbs to hunger pangs and begs for scraps at an RV park in Ohio. Infinitely wiser than Bolt, Mittens helps the whelp make his transition from super dog to normal hound.At the Ohio RV park, Bolt and Mittens encounter Rhino. Rhino (voiced by Mark Walton of 'Chicken Little') is an energetic hamster who rolls around in a transparent plastic exercise ball. His favorite pastime is watching TV with his sphere balanced on the remote control so he can channel surf. The clueless Rhino worships Bolt as the super hero of his dreams and accompanies Mittens and Bolt to Las Vegas where they dine off left over casino buffet food in dumpsters. Along the way, Bolt discovers the simple pleasures of riding with his head stuck out a window of a moving vehicle, his ears sailing in the breeze, with his tongue trailing from the corner of his muzzle like a pennant. Just as Bolt is ready to surrender to the brutal, harsh grind of everyday life, Rhino refuses to let his hero sink into self-pity. Actually, this highly strung little hamster steals the show once he joins them, especially in a scene where Bolt and he rescue Mittens from an animal pound.The biggest problem with 'Bolt' is its anticlimactic plot. Nothing after the electrifying first scene can match Bolt's clash with Dr. Calico's attack choppers and the phantom motorcyclists that blast away with missiles at our genetically-altered hero. The finale at the studio where Bolt finds that he has been replaced by a doggie double is particularly heartbreaking, but co-directors Howard and Williams don't let us down. The animators do a splendid job of replicating Travolta's facial expressions on the snout of the heroic canine and Travolta reads his lines with admirable restraint. Children should enjoy the antics of these talking animals, and the fantastic 3-D digital projection will knock the eyes out of the adults who are worried about surviving this 81-minute comedy without reward. Watching 'Bolt' in any format other than 3-D is a waste of time.",8,3,5,3 December 2008
2012," The Special Effects Overshadow the Second-Rate Disaster Saga
","Writer & director Roland Emmerich has described '2012' as 'a modern retelling of Noah's Ark,' and his description is spot-on specific. Emmerich reigns as the duke of cinematic disaster. He launched his epic-scale disaster classic 'Independence Day' and followed it up with 'Godiza' and then 'The Day After Tomorrow.' Short of blowing up the universe, Emmerich cannot continue to tp the scope of these films in term of sheer magnitude. Some of the problems with '2012' is that it lacks any villains. Late in the fourth quarter somebody utters a line about the operation not being a conspiracy. Guess Emmerich and co-scribe Harald Kloser forgot about the Louve Museum curator who dies in a fiery car crash in Paris because he was going to spill the beans about the approaching disaster. Far-fetched heroics and superlative special effects cannot raise this mind-numbing disaster movie above its hopeless generic origins. None of the heroes are unusual, charismatic, or interesting. 'Con-Air' star John Cusack does his dad role again while Woody Harrelson plays an off-his-rocker broadcaster. The turgid story turns into a global odyssey from Southern California to China and the paths of a motley collection of protagonists intertwine as they struggle to save their own lives along with their families. Not surprisingly, the special effects overshadow the characters. The California and Las Vegas calamity scenes are tour-de-force, but they are wasted in a mundane melodrama about a desperate dad who rescues his cute ex-wife Kate Curtis(Amanda Peet of 'Syriana') and their two young kids Noah & Lilly Curtis(Liam James and Morgan Lily) along step-dad Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy of 'Duplicity') from certain death in Southern California. As Jackson Curtis, Cusack drives a limo for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric of the 'Pusher' movies) and has written a science fiction novel entitled 'Farewell Atlantis' that, though it sold less than 500 copies, impressed government scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor of 'American Gangster')enough that he wants to preserve it for posterity. The 'GoldenEye' style scene in a Russian cargo jet plunging into an enormous chasm that was once the Las Vegas strip is the second-best scene after the wholesale destruction of Santa Monica. Some of the back projection looks really obvious. Not only is screenplay by writer & director Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser incredibly pedestrian, but it also takes them some time to build up a head of steam. Ostensibly, they hang their narrative on the Mayan calendar that predicts an earthly cataclysm in the year 2012. '2012' starts three years before the events with some dull exposition. Actually, the ground-breaking special effects don't kick in until about 45 minutes into the action after all this dreary expository build-up. Although this science fiction fantasy lacks the excitement of 'Independence Day', '2012' surpasses than 'The Day After Tomorrow' because it is an international disaster movie. The breathless pace of the California scenes isn't repeated, and the film sinks into a coma during the second half of its interminable two-and-a-half-hour plus running time with its final scenes in China where everybody is rushing to climb aboard a number of huge arks. These large commodious vessels look pretty cool. Of course, a last-minute complication crops up that prevents the American ark from getting under way and it comes as no surprise that Jackson Curtis will have to save the day. Danny Glover of the 'Lethal Weapon' movies is cast as an older Obama-type U.S. President who prefers to stay behind and the closest to a villain that '2012' has is Wilson's chief of staff, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt of 'Don't Say a Word'), who has no problems leaving the poor behind in the wake of destruction.",4,1,2,25 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Supernatural Skullduggery of a Superficial Sort
","You know a $120 million plus movie is in big trouble when the most entertaining character appears in only one scene. Moreover, she defies the status quo ideal of the Hollywood babe. Rebel Wilson plays an overweight Goth chick that 'Ghost Rider' saves from a vicious mugger. During a TV news interview, she describes her rescuer and flutters her fingers around her head to illustrate the flames that engulfed Ghost Rider's bone-white skull. Clever, off-beat and hilarious as this memorable scene is, 'Daredevil' writer-director Mark Steven Johnson fails to deliver anything as comparatively fresh and spontaneous in his big-screen adaptation of 'Ghost Rider,' essentially supernatural skullduggery of a superficial sort. No, I haven't read the Marvel Comic, but what I have seen in them surpasses anything in the 110-minute, PG-13 rated Columbia Pictures' release. Altogether, 'Ghost Rider' suffers chiefly from hackneyed writing, lackluster villains, and pointless action scenes. 'Ghost Rider' lacks the epic scale of 'Superman,' 'Batman,' 'Blade,' 'X-Men,' and 'The Punisher.' Nevertheless, despite all these shortcomings, 'Ghost Rider' does boast a first-rate, hypnotic cast and impressive digital special effects. Neither compensate in the long run for the unimaginative screenplay so unless you are a hardcore 'Ghost Rider' disciple you can stand the wait until this opus hits DVD and save yourself a fistful of bucks. 'Ghost Rider' unfolds in chronological order. We see Johnny Blaze, portrayed early on by handsome young newcomer Matt Long, at age seventeen. Mind you, the resemblance between Long and Cage is negligible. Johnny discovers to his horror that his madcap motorcyclist father, Barton Blaze (seasoned TV star Brett Cullen), has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and his chances of survival are remote. In saunters an elegantly-clad, perfectly coiffed Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda of 'Easy Rider') with a cane. Meph offers to save Barton's life if Johnny will sell him his soul. Johnny bows to the devil's demands. Miraculously, Barton's doctor gives him a clean bill of health. Nevertheless, Barton dies tragically in the next scene when he crashes on the jump ramp and is burned to death. Predictably, Johnny explodes with rage, but he decides to live up to his end of the bargain, so dumps his pretty girlfriend Roxanne Simpson (Raquel Alessi) and goes off to become a legendary motorcyclist stunt master in the tradition of Evel Knievel. Nicolas Cage takes over as a grown-up, laid-back Johnny Blaze and he drives his manager Mack (Donal Logue of 'Blade') around the bend with one impossible stunt after another. At one point, Johnny makes a clearly impossible jump over four Black Hawk army helicopters in a football stadium without getting a scratch. Nothing in Mark Steven Johnson's script approaches realism and anybody who takes 'Ghost Rider' literally should be buckled into a straitjacket and bundled off to the nearest insane asylum for psychiatric evaluation. This Faustian fable about a motorcycle daredevil who is transformed after the sun goes down into a sinister skull-headed bounty hunter for Satan features the most anemic Satan since Elizabeth Hurley essayed the role in 'Bedazzled.' Traditionally, Mephistopheles is the toughest, most treacherous villain on the books, but this Meph falls back on Ghost Rider to fend off competition from his upstart son Blackheart ('American Beauty's' Wes Bentley in cadaverous pale white-face make-up), who wants to usurp his father. At this point, Johnson's script becomes convoluted as all get-out and introduces a cemetery caretaker (Sam Elliot of 'Rush') who keeps our hero abreast of all major plot revelations, including his own that he was once a Ghost Rider on horseback. Basically, aside from his flaming skull, Ghost Rider uses his penetrating glare, called a Penance Stare, to make his victims experience the anxiety of those that they have tormented. Naturally, this doesn't have much of an effect on Blackheart and they engage in a running fight. Teaming up with Blackheart are three cool-looking reprobates, Earth, Wind, and Fire. Like Blackheart, our hero takes his time dispatching these ruffians in looks only, otherwise 'Ghost Rider' would have been twenty minutes shorter (and probably better). Nicolas Cage takes none of this half-baked hocus pocus seriously and plays Johnny Blaze with a bad hair-cut for laughs, gobbling jelly beans out of a martini glass rather than drinking while he relaxes to Karen Carpenter 'sTop-40 songs, until the surprise ending that leaves the movie open for a sequel. Peter Fonda does as little as possible and plays Satan as if he were a mannequin, but at least he is stylish in his restraint. Sexy Eva Mendes plays Roxanne as a grown-up who has become a Lois Lane-type TV news reporter than keeps track of Johnny's exploits. Inevitably, to get to Ghost Rider, Blackheart kidnaps Roxanne and the two guys clash in the desert at a western town. The former Ghost Rider (Sam Elliot) saddles up and rides out into sand with Ghost Rider for the showdown. Once they arrive, the old grizzled Ghost Rider pitches our protagonist his shotgun and then hightails it. Talk about a waste of Sam Elliot. Blackheart never poses a genuine threat to Ghost Rider and our hero decks his unsavory henchmen as easily as if they were ten-pins in a bowling alley. The CGI of Ghost Rider riding a gravity-defying motorcycle vertically up a skyscraper and then wielding a blazing chain whip to attack an airborne helicopter looks terrific (with an obvious nod to 'King Kong') but means little in the overall scheme of things. As ominous as the hero looks after his transformation into a skeletal emissary of Satan, 'Ghost Rider' emerges as more kooky than spooky.",3,0,1,16 June 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," What A Revelation of an 'X-Men' Movie!
","Initially, 'Rush Hour' director Brett Ratner's 'X-Men: The Last Stand' did not appeal to me as much as the two Bryan Singer 'X-Men' movies. After I saw 'X-Men: The Last Stand' again, I changed my mind and consider it a great way to conclude the 'X-Men' trilogy. This costume-clad, comic-book, crime-fighters flick is every bit as good as its two predecessors, but it is far darker and less exhilarating than those first two movies. Indeed, if you haven't seen 'X-Men' and 'X2: X-Men United,' then you will be lost watching 'X-Men: The Last Stand.' This briskly-paced but serious saga clocks in at a trim 104 minutes and doesn't pull any punches. Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto/Eric Lehnsherr clash over Jean Grey (Famke Janssen of 'GoldenEye') and the plot centers around the lady. Comparably, the more upbeat 'X2' ended on a tragic note with Jean sacrificing her life so that the rest of the 'X-Men' could escape in a chopper before wood flooded it and killed them. Essentially, 'X2' functions as the equivalent of 'Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan' where Mr. Spock sacrificed himself for the good of the many. Jean Gray vanishes in 'X2,' but she returns in 'X-Men: The Last Strand' and assumes dominance over Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Panquin) whose lives were the focus of the first 'X-Men.' This qualifies as a gripping movie because important changes occur in the Simon Kindberg and Zack Penn screenplay. 'X-Men: The Last Stand' bristles with surprises and revelations and the character of Jean Gray and her alter ego Phoenix. Phoenix shakes up everything. Professor X dies within the first hour and Mystique fares no better. Part of the plot continues the public debate over the dangers that mutants pose and the appearance of a new drug that has been designed as a cure. Mystique (Rebecca Romijn of 'The Punisher') is the first casualty and becomes a normal person in the process of shielding Magneto from the medicine. The demise of not only Professor X but also Scott Summers / Cyclops (James Marsden) lends the movie a heavyweight sense of soberness. Nevertheless, this is an actioneer and several new characters, like the muscular Cain Marko / Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) appears as well as the girl who can walk through walls, Kitty Pryde / Shadowcat (Ellen Page of 'Juno'), and Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy / Beast (Kelsey Grammar in a remarkable performance). The battle between Phoenix and Wolverine is cool. Stick around for the end of the end credits if you want to see another surprise.",10,5,7,25 June 2011
I Am Legend," Legendarily Lame Science Fiction Remake!!!
","Hollywood has never had much luck adapting science fiction author Richard Matheson's cult 1954 novel 'I Am Legend' successfully for the screen. Iconic horror movie star Vincent Price headlined the first version; the Italian-lensed 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964) ranked as an austere, but depressing widescreen, black & white epic with vampire/zombies as our hero's antagonists. Call them zompires! Price impersonated a valiant scientist, Robert Morgan, with an acquired immunity to a deadly virus that had devastated mankind. Morgan struggled desperately not only to survive acute loneliness but also to cure the survivors. Full-frame copies of this opus are available everywhere in DVD bargain box sets. Not-surprisingly, Price perished in the end.Charlton Heston retooled the role for the 1971 remake, 'The Omega Man,' released by Warner Brothers. Heston turned immunologist Robert Neville into a brawny, bare-chested, romantic, action stud hero who cavorted in a blue flight suit with a dress uniform cap complete with scrambled eggs on the visor. Watch 'The Omega Man' and see if Neville doesn't resemble a Marvel Comics character. Naturally, Heston brought the messianic allure that he had gained from 'The 10 Commandments' and 'Ben-Hur' to the role. Along the way, Heston's Neville indulged in one of the first interracial big-screen romances with African-American actress Rosalind Cash. An army of heavily robed, non-vampiric mutants led by Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) triumphed over him, and he died tragically as a misunderstood Christ figure.Will Smith fares even worse in the third and least well-done version, 'I Am Legend' which finally uses the original title of Matheson's novel. Essentially, Smith imitates the Heston hero as a weapons reliant action hero/virologist. They differ in how they contend with loneliness. Heston played chess with a bust of Julius Caesar and fed images of himself via a surveillance camera onto a big-screen television. Smith's Neville dresses up mannequins at a local video rental store and converses with them when he selects a movie. Unlike both Price and Heston, Smith doesn't enjoy a post-apocalyptic romance. Instead of female companionship, Smith has to settle for a German shepherd; canine lovers are warned ahead of time to expect the worst. Even when a woman, Anna (Alice Braga of 'City of God'), does show up near the end, our hero doesn't take the time to sweep her off her feet.Generally, the problem with all three movies is that the star has to bear the movie on his shoulders for the brunt of the action. Remember that hideous Tom Hanks' movie 'Castaway?' Half of 'I Am Legend' looks like 'Castaway' with Will Smith performing monologues devoid of humor. Sadly, despite a strong performance, Smith has to confront adversaries that neither Price nor Heston contended with—namely, colorless, chrome-domed, computer-generated cannibals. 'I Am Legend' forfeits any semblance of dramatic impact, much as 'I, Robot' did, with its cartoon-like CGI villains. Smith wages an eternal war against video game antagonists who cannot speak, making them dim-witted, lowest-common-denominator dolts.'I Am Legend' opens on an ironic note. Scientists have discovered a cure for cancer. Things go incredibly amiss, however, and Dr. Krippen (an unbilled Emma Thompson of 'Sense and Sensibility') winds up unleashing a man-made virus in the year 2009 that transforms humanity into homicidal mutants that plunder and destroy everything in sight. Incidentally, these mutants don't appear until midway in the movie after scenarists Mark Protosevich of 'Poseidon' and Akiva Goldman of 'Batman & Robin' have established Smith's character and his predicament. The filmmakers rely on occasional flashbacks to fracture that storyline and show how Smith became the last man on Earth. We learn that his wife (Salli Richardson of TV's 'Eureka') and daughter (Smith's real-life daughter Willow) died in a helicopter collision around the same time that the military quarantined Manhattan Island and sealed off access to it. The military destroy the two landmark Big Apple bridges, but Neville (Will Smith) vows to remain at ground zero and devise a cure.Three years later, in 2012, Neville and his dog venture outside by day to search for non-infected survivors as well as to forage for food and lock themselves up at night. In an early scene, Neville hunts for fresh meat by pursuing escaped zoo animals through the cluttered, weed-choked canyons of Manhattan in a red Ford Mustang with a high powered rifle. He watches old television shows that he has recorded before the apocalypse while he eats. The mutants themselves are not very interesting. In 'Last Man on Earth,' the mutants were vampire/zombies that besieged the hero's house at night. In 'The Omega Man,' the villains were the equivalent of albino Klansmen that terrorized the streets after dark and clashed constantly with Neville.Like the previous versions, 'I Am Legend' delivers a dour, downbeat ending that will bum you out beyond belief. The special effects are shoddy and superficial; the villains emerge as a mob of one-dimensional, head-banging morons, and the hero degenerates into an ignoble, unsympathetic, atheistic lout. There is nothing exciting or suspenseful about our hero's late-night encounter with the mutants on the docks where he uses his SUV as a weapon to smash them. Even more implausible is the way that he gets out of this cliffhanger confrontation. 'Constantine' director Francis Lawrence provides several startling, gotcha-by-the-gullet, scare scenes that will frighten the squeamish, but seasoned gorehounds won't find anything different or dazzling about this drivel.Will Smith's track record with science fiction is faltering badly these days. 'I Am Legend' is nowhere near as memorable or entertaining as either 'Independence Day' or his 'Men in Black' movies. Instead, 'I Am Legend' is legendarily lame!",1,156,244,20 December 2007
A Quiet Place," Hush Hush!!!
","The use of breathless silence to create white-knuckled suspense in a horror chiller as the characters await an inevitable confrontation with evil separates good scary movies from bad. Silence is golden in actor/director John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place,' a clever but contrived synthesis of science fiction and horror after an apocalyptic alien invasion of Earth. A species of scene-stealing fiends straight out of an H.P. Lovecraft nightmare have infested the planet. Equipped with hypersensitive hearing, they prey mercilessly on mankind, tracking people down by any sounds they make and then eviscerating them with trenchant talons and porcupine teeth. 'Nightlight' scenarists Bryan Woods & Scott Beck, along with Krasinski, have formulated a unique premise. Menacing as these ultra-deadly alien spawn are, they cannot see. Indeed, they are as blind as bats! These skeletal creatures make gnashing sounds as they stalk their victims and then cut loose with ear-splitting shrieks like tortured swine screaming in agony. Although untold numbers of these invaders roam the countryside, they usually launch attacks one at a time rather than in droves. Unlike typical creature features that conceal their monstrosities in shadows, 'A Quiet Place' presents these gruesome extraterrestrials in all their creepy ugliness. Moreover, these fiendish devils strike like lightning, and they can slash through metal as if it were tin-foil with their talons. The CGI gurus at Industrial Light & Magic have forged a truly frightening creature that will join the pantheon of fiends like those in 'Alien,' 'Predator,' and 'The Thing.' Whimpering is more than enough to get you killed in an instant if one of these aliens lurks in the vicinity. During long stretches of time, Krasinski and his writers show how one family in rural upstate New York has survived under these death-defying conditions with elaborate but improvised safeguards.Basically, 'A Quiet Place' focuses on one family. Smart and sharp as it is, this $17-million scary saga qualifies as an old-fashioned B-movie that provides minimal information about its alien apocalypse. No bespectacled scientists give lectures about this extraordinary phenomenon. In the farmhouse where the family holes up, newspaper clippings are plastered about the room about the alien onslaught and its deadly consequences. The Abbot family are scavenging a deserted supermarket for anything of value. Lee Abbot (John Krasinski of 'Leatherheads') and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt of 'Loopers') are conducting an inventory of can goods, prescription medicine, and other grocery items without uttering a syllable. The Abbot's deaf daughter Reagan (Millicent Simmonds of 'Wonderstruck') and her younger, little brother, Beau (newcomer Cade Woodward) are browsing through the toys, while her older brother Marcus (Noah Jupe of 'Wonder') is engaged elsewhere. Beau spots a toy model of the Space Shuttle on a shelf just out of his reach. When he lunges for it, the model topples off the shelf. Fortunately, Reagan intercepts it before the toy crashes to the floor. The shuttle comes equipped with batteries. Before Beau can activate the spacecraft's lights and sound effects, Lee intervenes and removes the batteries.No matter where they are, the Abbots conduct themselves like Trappist monks, adopting a vow of silence, for fear of attracting the aliens with noise of the least decibel. Rarely do the Abbots speak above a hushed whisper. Instead, they communicate with sign language. The lengthening shadows outside the supermarket alert them that dusk is approaching. Lee and Evelyn and their three children leave the store and walk home. They follow a path piled with dirt to muffle not only their own footsteps, but also anything else, like crunchy leaves, that might betray their presence. Reagan takes pity on Beau and gives the Space Shuttle model with its batteries intact back to him. Tragedy occurs when they reach the woods, and naive little Beau activates the toy Space Shuttle. Lee, Evelyn, Marcus, and Reagan freeze in their footsteps as the Shuttle toy shatters the silence with an abrupt and noisy crescendo. An evil creature with its acute sonar-like hearing smashes through the woods like a juggernaut toward the little boy. Lee scrambles desperately to save his young son, but he is too late. Evelyn blames herself for not having watched Beau closer, while Reagan is mortified by her role in giving him the shuttle toy with the batteries in it. Thus, ends day number 89!When we see the Abbots again, 472 days have elapsed. Evelyn has gotten pregnant again. Lee toils in his laboratory workshop in the basement of their rambling farmhouse where he tinkers with hearing aids for Reagan. Occasionally, he broadcasts a signal on his ham radio, but nobody has ever responded. The couple have developed other items to ensure their own survival. They have turned a crate into a crib. Lee has equipped it for an infant to sleep peacefully in without alarming aliens. The father has installed an oxygen tank with a face mask in the footlocker, so the baby can sleep comfortably with the lid shut. You can imagine how an infant howling would arouse the wrath of those tyrannical aliens. The entire house has been marked so nobody steps on a board that might creak loudly. Occasionally, accidents occur. While Marcus and Reagan are playing a board game, Marcus knocks over a candle, and a fire erupts briefly. Lee smothers the blaze, and the family take up defensive positions. The most unforgettable scene involves Evelyn. Her water breaks, and then she steps on a nail with her bare foot! The sudden gust of breath that she takes brings a monster storming onto the premises. Lee, Marcus, and Reagan are away when this happens. Evelyn cringes in a bathtub as the inhuman heathen skulks around the bathroom without realizing she is nearby.Clocking in at 90 spine-tingling minutes, Krasinski's movie shuns those predictable jump-scare tactics where everybody screams like banshees. The suspense and the tension that 'A Quiet Place' methodically builds with impeccable artistry will keep you gasping for breath as you struggle not to make a sound.",8,0,2,2 December 2019
22 Jump Street," 22 Good Street!!!
","The shenanigans are far more silly, and the pandemonium far more preposterous in the farcical '21 Jump Street' parody sequel '22 Jump Street' co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Several actors from the original opus reprise their roles in this side-splitting sequel. Mind you, even Rob Riggle, who played dastardly Mr. Walters, the H.F.S. drug dealer whose penis got shot off, shows up with David Franco as prison inmates in a scene. Schmidt's mother and father turn up, too. Of course, since original TV 'Jump Street' headliner Johnny Depp suffered multiple gunshot wounds in the initial film, he doesn't come back. Rarely does a remake have the nerve to liquidate the heroes from the show that spawned the remake. Nevertheless, comedy is a genre that evolves with each generation. Meantime, '21 Jump Street' co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller do their level best to bring audiences back up to speed after a two-year hiatus. They rely on the television rehash exercise where a narrator informs us what 'previously' happened. Audiences are treated to a condensed version of '21 Jump Street.' When they aren't delivering better jokes and staging bigger Keystone Cops action set-pieces, Lord and Miller ridicule the formulaic conventions of sequels in general as well as '22 Jump Street' in particular. Lord and Miller also explore the bromantic relationship between the two protagonists in greater depth. Indeed, while '22 Jump Street' adheres to the blue-print plot of the first film, our heroes' new college-oriented assignment, the beefed-up, $50-million budget, and the clever end credits constitute some of the most imaginative comedy you'll ever see. One of the funniest gags features comic Seth Rogen in a droll cameo near the end of this crackerjack comedy of errors.Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are not actually attending a traditional college when we first meet them in '22 Jump Street.' Indeed, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube of 'Friday') told them at the end of '21 Jump Street' that they were going to college because they were too old to pose as teenagers in high school. Instead, they have been assigned to monitor internet communication at an on-line university. Specifically, they must listen for either suspicious keywords or phrases that might serve as code words for potential crimes. Our heroes learn about the meeting time and location at the harbor. Remember, Schmidt and Jenko are not brainiacs. The professor states the location in no uncertain terms during in his lecture. Like they did in '21 Jump Street,' Schmidt and Jenko find themselves out matched by the opposition. Schmidt masquerades as a laughable Mexican. The Ghost (Peter Stormare of 'Armageddon') and his henchman have a tractor-trailer load of contraband exotic animals. Predictably, Schmidt tangles with a large pink squid before all hell breaks loose. This idiotic moment rates laughs because comedian Jonah Hill is clearly doing all the work with his phony squid. If you've seen horror icon Bela Lugosi wrestling with an obviously fake rubber octopus in Ed Woods, Jr.'s 'Bride of the Monster' (1956), you can truly appreciate what makes such a scene such a howler! Afterward, our heroes struggle to stop The Ghost,' but this wily opponent eludes them with ease. The truck stunts in this scene get '22 Jump Street' off to an adrenaline-laced scene. Naturally, Schmidt and Jenko make buffoons of themselves, and Ghost gets away. Our heroes wind up in Deputy Chief Hardy's office to face the music. Hardy (Nick Offerman of 'We're the Millers') assigns them to 22 Jump Street, and they find themselves reunited with the profane Captain Dickson. The new office is located across the street from a church with a Korean Jesus. Schmidt and Jenko must find the villains behind a new synthetic drug called WhyPhy. According to Dickson, WhyPhy is a mixture of Adderall and Ecstasy with something else. You focus for the first couple of hours and then you party like never before and then you die. The only clue that they have is a photo of the student who bought the drug and later died using it. Schmidt and Jenko start hanging out with likely suspects. Jenko acquaints himself with two football players, Zook (Wyatt Russell of 'Cowboys & Aliens') and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro of 'Grown Ups 2'), who belong to a fraternity. Meantime, the athletically challenged Schmidt attracts the attention of an art major, Maya (Amber Stevens of 'The Amazing Spider-Man'), when he performs slam poetry. Gradually, Schmidt and Jenko fall out of touch with each other, and this creates friction between them. Jenko has taken up big time with Zook and joins the college football team. These two are literally wired into each other because Jenko is always where he is supposed to be to catch the football! Eventually, our heroes take a break to visit Mr. Walters (Rob Ripple) and seek his advice about finding the WhyPhy suppliers.Happily, '22 Jump Street' never takes itself seriously and never loses sight of its origins as a sequel. '21 Jump Street' should be best remembered as the first buddy cop movie to address the relationship dynamics between male partners. '22 Jump Street' pokes fun at Schmidt and Jenko, and our heroes have to endure a droll counseling session with a shrink. The African-American twins Keith & Kenny Yang (The Lucas Brothers) who live across the hall from them in the dorm will keep you in stitches with their antics. Similarly, Mr. Walters' prison scenes are humorous. Our heroes experience some changes themselves, particularly Schmidt. Schmidt loses his virginity, and the surprise is the identity of the girl's father. Jenko indulges in malapropisms. He says 'anals' when he means 'annuals.' He also practices Parkour and is able to shimmy up anything. I didn't laugh as often at '21 Jump Street' so '22 Jump Street' took me by surprise. Not only does it live up to its predecessor with its 'Saturday Night Live sketch-type humor, but '22 Jump Street' also surpasses the original.",8,1,5,22 June 2014
Cars 2," A Sequel That Surpasses The Original!!!
","You know the topic of alternative fuel sources has attained a new urgency when an animated movie appropriates it as its theme. The new Pixar/Disney racecar sequel 'Cars 2' deals with the issue of our scarce oil reserves and the need to conjure up a substitute. 'Cars' director John Lasseter and 'Proximity' scenarist Ben Queen have skillfully inserted this message into 'Cars 2' without slighting the shenanigans which made the original comedy such fun. In fact, 'Cars 2' qualifies as the rare sequel that surpasses its predecessor. The chief reason this hilarious sequel tops 'Cars' is that Lasseter and crew have promoted Lightning McQueen's sidekick Tow Mater to the pole position. Larry the Cable Guy's cinematic career appeared in the pits before he provided the voice for Tow Mater. His redneck accent and cornpone humor made him ideal for a rusted wrecker with no hood and buck teeth sticking out of its grille. Sidekicks have always been scene-stealers, and Tow Mater is virtually the whole show in 'Cars 2.' Mind you, British actor Michael Caine gives Larry the Cable Guy a run for his money, relegating goodie-four tires Lightning McQueen to third place. McQueen still claims his share of screen time. Indeed, he provides the motivation for the plot. Nevertheless, Tow Mater and a gray Aston Martin, voiced by Michael Caine, named Finn McMissile emerge as the leading cars. Unlike the racecars only plot for the original, 'Cars 2' shifts its gears and combines the usual racing antics with a sophisticated plot about a devious effort to discredit alternative fuel sources. Again, when a kids' movie shines the limelight on the issue as imaginatively as Pixar and Disney have done, you have to wonder who has gone to sleep at the steering wheel. In a sense, 'Car 2' amounts to a clever propaganda movie that advocates the manufacture of alternative fuel sources. Just as 'Cars' celebrated the happy days before an interstate highway bypassed a town and demoted it to obscurity; 'Cars 2' recalls 1960s' nostalgia when James Bond made the silver screen sizzle. Basically, 'Cars 2' sends red racing car Lightning McQueen and his best friend Tow Mater off onto the international racing circuit after a conceited Italian hot rodder, Francesco (voice of John Turturro), challenges our hero to prove who has the fastest wheels in the world. No sooner has McQueen gotten back to Radiator Springs after clinching his fourth Piston Cup championship than he wants to pick up where he left off with his girlfriend Sally (voice of Bonnie Hunt) who is the powder-blue Porsche. Initially, McQueen and Tow Mater have a blast speeding around town and indulging in some really big tractor tipping. Afterward, McQueen plans to date Sally and explains to Tow Mater that they want to be alone together. Not one to be put off, Tow Mater crashes their dinner date by posing as a waiter. Lightning and Sally order their 'usual' drinks. Tow Mater careens off to the bar to fetch them without knowing what they drink. While Tow Mater wonders what those 'usual' drinks are, he hears a Formula-One racecar named Francesco insult McQueen on the Mel Dorado television show. In no time, a crowd of cars assembled around Tow Mater who has called into the show to tell off Francesco. McQueen and Sally notice the crowd. Eventually, McQueen intervenes after Francesco insults Tow Mater. The sponsor of the World Grand Prix, Sir Miles Axlerod (voice of Eddie Izzard), is a wealthy Land Rover who is overjoyed when McQueen decides to enter his race. As car characters go, Sir Miles is an interesting vehicle. It seems he decided to circle the globe without a GPS and wound up lost in the wilderness where he exhausted his gasoline supply. Everybody had given up Sir Miles as lost when he emerged from the jungle running on a fuel source that he markets now as Allinol. The World Grand Prix represents Sir Miles' attempt to corner alternative fuel source market. Sir Miles plans to stage three races in Japan, Italy, and England to tout Allinol as a substitute for gasoline. Furthermore, he is making Allinol available to all racers. Nevertheless, there is more to Sir Miles than meets the eye, and Finn McMissile suspects the racing magnate has other things under his hood. 'Cars 2' opens with Finn riding out to a remote part of the ocean in the middle of the night for a rendezvous with another car. When the trawler transporting Finn encounters a bigger trawler that threatens to blow it out of the water, the smaller trawler flees. Meanwhile, Finn manages to latch onto the bigger trawler and ride it back to a stretch of ocean dotted by a multitude of oil rigs atop a new underwater range of oil reserves.If you think Sir Miles is a character, Finn McMissile is an Aston Martin with a gadget for every contingency. He can scale walls using grappling hooks launched from his bumpers. He has special magnetic tire covers that enable him to drive up the legs of mammoth oil rigs. Of course, he boasts other more traditional gadgets that allow him to perform equally incredible feats. Somehow, an American spycar posing as a Gremlin to infiltrate the villain's ranks acquires all the information that Finn needs to expose the mystery surrounding a worldwide scam. Before the American agent car is destroyed by the villains, he slips the information to an unsuspecting Tow Mater. Finn mistakes Tow Mater as a world-class espionage agent masquerading as a buffoon. You can just imagine all the hilarity that ensues when a fleet of Gremlins, Pacers, and Yugos pursue Tow Mater to relieve him of the information which will not only expose their perfidy but also the car behind it. Lasseter orchestrates one amusing stunt after another in this lively 106-minute spoof of spy movies with more sight gags than you will ever spot on the first viewing.",Null,2,4,11 July 2011
The Game," 'The Game' is Game!!!
","Actor Michael Douglas is one of those rare Hollywood talents who doesn't make a fool o of himself on screen. An excellent judge of movie scripts, he either creates trends as he did with 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Basic Instinct,' or catches them before they curdle as with 'Romancing the Stone.' In British director David Fincher's latest excursion into paranoia, 'The Game,' Douglas has found not only a choice role for himself but also a provocative thriller that is as cerebral as it is tantalizing. You won't have nightmares from watching 'The Game,' but you might think twice about that next alcoholic drink somebody else pours for you. Scenarists John Brancato and Michael Ferris have penned an imaginative but mischievous movie that lifts elements from the Yul Brynner chiller 'Westworld' (1973) and the 1932 classic adventure epic 'The Most Dangerous Game.' Neither a science fiction opus nor a gruesome adventure, 'The Game' is an enthralling melodrama that keeps you dangling for most of its lengthy running time. If you're one of those moviegoers who strives to stay a step ahead of the hero, 'The Game' may frustrate you. Brancato and Ferris serve up a number of obvious clichÃ©s and rely on time-proved plot gimmicks. Nevertheless, they have integrated both into the action so seamlessly that you should think before you complain. In 'The Game,' characterization and motivation ably abet the vicissitudes of a deliberately murky and incredibly far-fetched story. No, 'The Game' is not as aggravating as the Mel Gibson, sleight-of-hand thriller 'Conspiracy Theory' with Julia Roberts. Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton. He is a strictly business oriented tycoon who would warm the cockles of Mr. Scrooge's heart. Divorced from his wife, he resides in a dark, tomb-like, palatial mansion with huge, wrought-iron gates. Van Orton's maid (the 1960s' bombshell Carroll Baker of 'Baby Doll' fame) dutifully cooks and cleans for him, but their relationship is distant, too. He keeps everybody at arm's length, and his personality is as remote as it is regimented. Van Orton has no qualms about firing an employee on the spot. In sum, Van Orton combines the ruthless characteristics of Douglas' honcho in 'Wall Street' with the awkward social graces of Harrison Ford's banker in 'Sabrina.' Van Orton is not a sympathetic character, so everything that befalls him in 'The Game' constitutes a just comeuppance for the shoddy way that he has treated people.That's part of the fun of 'The Game.' The Douglas protagonist is an out-and-out bastard. He deserves all the bad luck that he stumbles across, and we get to cheer every obstacle that he encounters because it is going to screw up the carefully preserved life that he has constructed for himself. You don't so much worry about how Van Orton effects his hair-raising escapes in 'The Game' as you indulge in the way those cliffhangers challenge him. Van Orton's 48th birthday is creeping up, but he is in no mood to celebrate. In a series of superbly done flashbacks that resemble vintage Super-8 movies, Van Orton relives the suicide plunge that his equally remote father took on his own 48th birthday. Into Van Orton's musty, stale lif34 bursts his black sheep brother played with marvelous abandon by bad boy Sean Penn. It is an amazing coup of casting that works because Conrad is so much Nicholas' opposite in both personality and temperament. Conrad gate-crashes Nicholas' private club and breaks the rules about smoking because his older brother is so highly placed. He presents Nicholas with a belated birthday present. It's a gift certificate from an obscure agency called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).Conrad assures Nicholas that 'the game' will put the fun back into his humdrum existence. At first, Van Orton is reluctant to contact CRS. Curiosity gets the better of him. When he goes in for an interview, he finds the CRS people are neither deferential nor accommodating. They require him to fill out time-consuming questionnaires and perform various physical skills tests. When they're finished with these grueling tests, they assure him that they'll call him about his evaluation. Miffed at their callous treatment, Nicholas stalks out. Of course, Nicholas qualifies to play the game. What exactly is the game? 'The Game' is one of those movies that you only really get to see once. The filmmakers are depending on your own curiosity as much as your frustration with the lengthy setup for the story. Almost an hour into 'The Game,' you still aren't totally sure what is happening. It's as if the filmmakers are stalking their audience, delaying their revelations as long as they can to get the most out of both the plot and the audience. If you have the patience for this complicated build-up, you'll be rewarded. If you see 'The Game' a second time, you'll appreciate that long build-up because you'll see it coming and its multiple surprises won't catch you as off-guard like they may on first viewing. While credit must be given to both the calculated efforts of writers Brancato and Ferris, director David Fincher probably deserves the lion's share of the success of 'The Game.' A former music video direction, Finch broke into the movies with 'Alien 3' back in 1992. The performances contribute to the success of 'The Game,' too. Douglas is perfectly cast as Nicholas Van Orton, and Peen's intermittent appearances are cleverly timed. Deborah Kara Unger of Crash' fame looks as if she could be the next Sharon Stone as the sexy siren who lures Van Orton to his destruction. 'The Game' has a haunting quality, and you can't be sure whether the filmmakers are out to scare you or have a joke at your expense. As they used to say in the vintage Patrick McGoohan sci-fi television show 'The Prisoner' to say anything more about 'The Game' would be 'telling.'",10,2,5,8 October 2013
Kick-Ass," First-Rate Adaptation of 'KIck Ass!!!'
","This violent, exciting, R-rated, cinematic adaptation of Mark Millar's radical graphic novel about a tyke-sized babe in a mask,cape, and a skirt with a sharp pig-sticker is a total blast.

He goes so far as to shoot her with live rounds of ammunition twice so she can prepare herself for the eventuality that she may be shot during a showdown. As crime boss Frank D'Amico, Mark Strong makes a strong impression. As it turns out, D'Amico framed a cop and sent him to jail for five years. Now, the cop is out of prison and plots revenge against the villain. D'Amico is the ultimate villain who heads up the mafia in the Big Apple.

If you like no-holds-barred action, 'Kick Ass' will kick your ass!!!",9,4,5,25 August 2013
The Man Who Would Be King," An Adventure of a Lifetime!!!
","'Maltese Falcon' director John Huston's storybook adventure saga 'The Man Who Would Be King' casts Sean Connery and Michael Caine as two former British Army soldiers in 19th century India. These two scoundrels aspire to become kings in their own right in a distant land of Kafristan. Despite its downbeat ending, this ambitious saga has some amusing moments early on as the roguish pair visit the famous writer Rudyard Kipling before they march off to glory. This is an old-fashioned melodrama about a pair of mercenaries who get everything that they deserve in the long run. Nevertheless, Connery and Caine have a field day as the Queen's own until they encounter tragedy. Our protagonists masquerade as natives and enter a land where no white man has been seen since Alexander the Great in 230 B.C. They raise an army from a small ruler's kingdom and march into battle against one tyrant after another until Connery's Daniel Dravot leads a reckless charge against the enemy in their first battle against the orders of his comrade-in-arms Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) who reprimands him for his amateurish behavior. During the charge, an arrow plunges into Daniel's chest, but lodges harmlessly in his bandoleer and he survives. However, everybody who witnessed his exploit believe that Daniel survived because he is nothing less than divine, a god, and they fall down on their knees and worship him. Predictably, our heroes amass a fortune in gold, but Daniel begins to believe in his own divinity and makes the mistake of taking a wife. When the dame bites him during their wedding ceremony, they realize that they have cooked their collective geese. Everybody realizes that Daniel isn't a god and they sent him to his death and crucify poor Peachy. Lensed on location in sunny, sand-swept Morocco, 'The Man Who Would Be King' was a life-long dream of writer & director John Huston who initially sought to make it during the Golden Age of Hollywood with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart.",10,3,6,9 February 2016
Unknown," A Lukewarm Amnesia Thriller With Too Many Complications
","Liam Neeson looks like the new Harrison Ford in 'Orphan' director Jaume Collet-Serra's movie 'Unknown,' a lukewarm amnesia thriller set in Berlin about a biophysicist who loses his memory in a car accident. The people who produced 'Unknown' probably never saw a potboiler called 'Frantic' that Ford made in 1988 for notorious Polish helmer Roman Polanski. Ford played an American doctor whose wife is kidnapped when he attends a medical conference in Paris. Predictably, the French police are too incompetent to help. Instead, Ford turns to a young single girl who lives on the fringe. She guides him through the Parisian underworld to find the kidnappers. In 'Unknown,' Neeson plays an American doctor who loses his memory after his taxi plunges off a bridge into a river and he nearly drowns. The female taxi driver at the wheel when the accident occurred saves his life. Afterward, she vanishes without a trace. Neeson spends four days in a coma as a result of the accident. When he recovers, he leaves the hospital against his doctor's advice. Neeson gets the surprise of his life when he confronts his wife. First, she doesn't recognize him. Second, another man is posing as her husband! Neeson relies on an illegal immigrant to navigate Berlin so he can elude the omnipotent villains. There is as much Robert Ludlum as there is Alfred Hitchcock in this PG-13 exercise in suspense and intrigue. 'Frantic' fell frantically flat, and 'Unknown' fares moderately better. Anybody hoping that 'Unknown' would rival Neeson's earlier actioneer 'Taken' should prepare themselves for a letdown. Despite a number of narrative surprises and Neeson's sincere performance as a hero caught up in a vast web of conspiracy, 'Unknown' lacks the charisma and catharsis that made 'Taken' such a crackerjack thriller.Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson of 'Batman Begins') and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones of 'Anger Management') arrive in snowy Berlin for a biotechnology summit. The wealthy Prince Shada (Mido Hamada of 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow') and Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch of 'Black Book') are sponsoring the summit that will yield a scientific innovation to halt world hunger. Security is tight because terrorists have tried to kill Prince Shada. When Harris and his wife show up at the motel, he discovers he is missing his brief case. Martin leaves Elizabeth to register at the front desk, while he catches a cab back to the airport to retrieve the case. The briefcase contains Harris' passport and other valuables. The trip back to the airport turns out to be a little more exciting than our hero thought. A truck transporting a refrigerator loses the appliance. Harris' cab driver Gina (Diane Kruger of 'Inglourious Basterds') swerves to avoid the fridge. The cab careens wildly, crashes through a bridge and plunges into a river. Gina smashes the rear window of the cab and rescues Harris. Harris lies in a coma that for four days. When he awakens, Harris is desperate to reach his wife. Unfortunately, Harris has no identification. Worse, he is suffering from a case of amnesia.Eventually, Harris recovers his wits sufficiently to discharge himself from the hospital. Imagine his surprise when he walks into the conference and learns that another man, Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn of 'Legends of the Fall'), is impersonating him. Harris erupts with fury initially but then has the good sense to back off before the Berlin police arrest him. He returns to the hospital, and an assassin tries to murder him after killing a nurse. Miraculously, Harris escapes from his assailants and searches for the cab driver who can prove his identity. The complication here is that Gina is an illegal Bosnian immigrant without a passport. Moreover, she wants nothing to do with Harris. Later, she changes her mind and lets him shower at her cramped apartment. Things change quickly as a ruthless pair of killers show up to silence him. Harris hires a former Stasi officer-turned-private investigator, Ernst Jürgen (Bruno Ganz of 'Downfall'), to help him sort things out. Harris is flabbergasted that he cannot prove his identity to anybody and the language barrier doesn't mitigate his madness. He relies on Gina to get him around the city and translate for him.'Unknown' is not as good as Collet-Serra's 'Orphan,' but it far surpasses his anemic 'House of Wax' remake. The surprise-laden screenplay by 'Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde' scribe Oliver Butcher and 'Killing Streets' scenarist Stephen Comwell, derived from French author Didier Van Cauwelaert's novel 'Out of My Head,' strains believability at every turn. The Neeson character behaves like an imbecile when he loses his briefcase at the airport and later Professor Bressler is just as idiotic when he allows a woman to take his laptop away from him so she can copy his ultra-secret files. Eventually, when the assassins come after our hero, they make it obvious that they are after him. Our hero suspects that he is being shadowed in the Berlin subway. His suspicions are confirmed when a bespectacled stranger pursues him at a run. Mind you, Harris' assailant could have quietly sidled up beside him and killed the hero without arousing his suspicions. Collet-Serra and his writer spend most of their 113 minutes trying to distract us from the obvious. The surprise ending raises more questions than it resolves, and you'll feel cheated instead of astonished. Ultimately, 'Unknown' amounts to a half-baked synthesis of 'The Bourne Identity' and 'Shutter Island.'",6,1,8,20 February 2011
Gran Torino," 'Gran Torino' is one HELL of a ride!
","Two-time Oscar winning director Clint Eastwood of 'Million Dollar Baby' directs and stars in 'Gran Torino,' another top-drawer drama that appears to have been tailor-made for his talents and personality. Three-fourths of 'Gran Torino' is as entertaining and amusing as any 'All in the Family' episode except that the bigoted hero indulges in profanity and racism galore. Mind you, this is an R-rated movie. The last quarter hour turns pretty grim and tragic, like John Wayne's final western 'The Shootist' (1976) as the hero asserts his beliefs in the face of insurmountable odds. Die-hard Clint fans will gobble up the first three-fourths of 'Gran Torino,' while the last fourth will surprise but sadden them. People that thought the ending to 'Unforgiven' seemed unrealistic will probably applaud the 'Gran Torino' finale. Ironically, despite his animosity toward his Asian neighbors, our hero mellows over the course of the film's 116 minutes, and the Asians become more like family to him than his own blood relatives.'Gran Torino' qualifies as a first-rate character study about 78-year old, retired Ford assembly plant worker Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood of 'Heartbreak Ridge'), who served his country patriotically in the Korean War and whose wife has just died. Left alone to fend for himself, Walt whiles away his days sitting on his front porch and guzzles one beer after another with his docile yellow Labrador named Daisy curled up contentedly at his feet. Walt mows his lawn with an old push mower and watches with disgust as the large population of mountain peoplethe Hmong--from Southeast Asia gradually take over his Detroit suburb. Indeed, Walt doesn't care for their kind, and they have no love lost for him. Walt's next door neighbors, an elderly grandmother (newcomer Chee Thao), her daughter with her own daughter Sue (Ahney Her) and her introverted son Thao (Bee Vang)living with her try to steer clear of Walt.The teenaged Thao, who lives next door, doesn't have a job. One day a carload of Hispanic gangbangers give him grief as he is walking along a sidewalk minding his own business. Thao's own kind, another carload of just as unsavory young gangbangers, cruise to his rescue, and warn the Hispanics to watch out. These Asian gangbangers want to take Thao in as their latest gang member, and Thao decides to join them. If he can steal the vintage Ford Gran Torino that Walt has parked in his garage, the gangbangers will induct him as one of their own.Predictably, Thao bungles the theft and his fellow gangbangers show up to take it out of his hide. While they are using him as a human punching bag, they make the mistake of trespassing on Walt's lawn. Walt marches out to meet them with 9.5 pound American M-1 Garand, .30-06 gas operated rifle anchored against his shoulder with its sights trained on them. 'Get off my lawn,' he growls with menace, and everybody retreats. The gangbangers resent Walt's intrusion and give him dirty looks. 'We used to stack you up five deep like sandbags in Korea,' he adds with his finger on the trigger. Reluctantly, these hard cases back off. After the incident, the entire Asian community visits Walt's house and stack tributes of flowers and food on his front steps as if they were visiting a shrine. Naturally, Walt doesn't understand any of this adulation.Sue visits Walt on his porch one day as he runs out of beer and invites him over for a drink. Walt meets the family and the tension between these neighbors gradually abates, enough so that Thao's mother and Sue force Thao to work off his attempted theft of Walt's car by performing odd jobs for him. Walt takes a shine to Thao, and they bond. Eventually, Walt becomes Thao mentor. He shows him how to become responsible, win the girl of his dreams, and obtain a job as a construction worker. Inevitably, the Asian gangbangers come back to haunt both Thao and Walt, but wily old Walt proves that old guys can be tough guys right up to the end.Despite his age and wrinkles, Clint can still snarl with the best of them, and he looks every bit as lethal here as he did when he played Inspector Callahan in 'Dirty Harry' back in 1971. The big difference is Walt wields an M-1 rifle rather than a Model 29 Smith & Wesson. The eponymous car is one that Walt helped build and he maintains in mint condition in his garage. As much as it is a character study, 'Gran Torino' also shows how people from different races can see eye-to-eye with each other more than they can with their own kind. Walt admits that he never understood his two sons, and he has little respect for a young Catholic priest Father Janovich(Christopher Carley of 'Garden State') who he thinks is still wet behind the ears. Altogether, 'Gran Torino' ranks as a terrific Clint Eastwood epic until three-fourths of the way through when everything changes as Walt takes on the neighborhood gangbangers. Some of the best scenes involve Walt rescuing Sue from a trio of black thugs that scared off her white boyfriend and Walt teaching Thao how to talk like a man in a barbershop scene with Martin (John Carroll Lynch of 'Zodiac'), a cantankerous Italian barber. 'Gran Torino' unfolds at a leisurely pace, sketches in its plot and characters with affection, but never wears out its welcome.",10,0,6,21 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Awesome Iraq War Movie
","'The Hurt Locker' lives up to its title. It is all about HURT as we follow a reckless Army Sergeant during a tour of duty in Iraq where he defuses enemy bombs. Director Kathryn Bigelow, whose movies include the superlative vampire movie 'Near Dark' (1987), the action-packed crime thriller 'Point Break' (1991), and the unusual sci-fi thriller 'Stranger Days' (1995), does a bang-up job capturing the atmosphere and characters caught up in Iraq. 'The Hurt Locker' isn't a beer & pizza movie that will make you laugh. Instead, it is a riveting drama that may make you cry, especially if you have served overseas in the military in the Middle East. At two hours and ten minutes, 'The Hurt Locker' is a lengthy movie, but Bigelow doesn't squander a second and there is nothing that could have been deleted. Some familiar faces show up for cameo appearance, like Ralph Fiennes as a British contractor sent to defuse bombs.SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner of '28 Days Later') replaces Sgt. Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce of 'L.A. Confidential') after he dies trying to neutralize an I.E.D., improvised explosive device, in an Iraq town. Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie of 'Notorious') does not get along with SSgt. James at first because James likes his job too much and derives an adrenaline thrill from being in dangerous predicaments. Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty of 'Bobby') does not like the insane risks that James takes. In one scene, after he discovers that a parked car outside the UN building has been booby-trapped with enough explosives to kill everybody within a block, James shucks his 80 pounds of bomb disposal uniform gear and sets out disarming the home-made but ingenious explosives. Colonel Reed (David Morse of 'The Rock') personally congratulates James for a job well-done and learns that James has disable over 800 bombs. The picture that Bigelow paints about the war in Iraq and the problems that the bomb disposal teams encounter is powerful stuff. At another point, James and company find a human bomb--i.e., a corpse with explosives concealed in its stomach--and James defuses it.Lead actor Jeremy Renner is a revelation. He has a Steve McQueen presence about him and you believe everything that he does because he does it so well. Writer Mark Boal was an embedded journalist and he wrote the screenplay that pulls no punches and you will no blink if you get engrossed in this taunt melodrama. This independent production was lensed on location in the Middle-Eastern country of Jordan but an American distributor picked it up for an American theatrical release. The closet movie to this that I know about is the 1959 Robert Aldritch helmed saga 'Ten Seconds to Hell' about defusing bombs in war-torn Germany.",10,4,13,19 January 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Shriver Your Timbers and Tickle Your Funny Bones
","If numbers mean anything to you, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is the fifth film in Walt Disney Studios' 18th century, supernatural, seafaring, fantasy franchise about swashbuckling buccaneers. Norwegian directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg of 'Bandidas' have taken the helm and recycled the best elements of the series with this boisterous as well as bizarre scavenger hunt for the fabled Trident of Poseidon. The Trident—according t0 'Tower Heist' writer Jeff Nathanson's elaborate but rambling screenplay--will absolve any curses cast on seagoing guys. The exhaustive Trident search amounts to a marathon enterprise in this scenic, widescreen, PG-13 rated, 129-minute epic, but everything works out in the surf. The CGI animation of various characters and the ocean where they find the Trident is probably a milestone for the franchise. Mind you, the 'Pirates' movies have savagely maligned for their heavy reliance on special visual effects. Given that fantasy is the keystone of the franchise, such criticism seems entirely irrelevant. Nothing about the 'Pirates' movies, aside from the exotic settings and sprawling production designs, is remotely authentic. After several mediocre movies and enough bad press to drive a lesser mortal into exile, Johnny Depp is back doing what he does best. Captain Jack Sparrow is as rum-soaked as ever, and Depp plays him with his characteristic flair for comic theatricality.Directors Rønning and Sandberg have delivered not only a superior sequel but also an interesting prequel. This time we see Jack before he acquired his signature headgear and attained the rank of captain. Captain Jack Sparrow is still as much a hero as a buffoon. This time out he is pitted against an utterly villainous ghost, while the pride of His Majesty's Imperial Fleet terrorizes him. Presumably, after the least memorable 0f sequels, i.e., 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,' producer Jerry Bruckheimer sought a return to form. Although it lacks the inspired spontaneity of the original 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,' you couldn't ask for more from this fourth sequel. Forty minutes shorter than the second, overindulgent sequel 'Dead Man's Chest,' 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' ties up many loose narrative threads as well as charts a possible future for the franchise.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' opens with an attention-grabbing scene. Twelve-year old Henry Turner (newcomer Lewis McGowan) rows out by himself into the ocean at night. Knotting a rope to his ankle, which in turn is attached to an anchor, he steps from the boat into the briny deep, and the anchor plunges him down to the ocean floor. Holding his breath all the way down, Henry lands on the deck of the sunken pirate ship The Flying Dutchman. Henry meets the ghostly apparition of his father, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom of 'Ned Kelly'), and assures him that he hasn't given up on his lifting the curse on his dad. Henry tells him about the Trident of Poseidon and assures his father that he can live on land again as soon as Henry acquires the trident. The Flying Dutchman surfaces from the deep, and Will reminds Henry that the trident is largely a legend. Nevertheless, Henry vows to find it. Nine years elapse, and Henry (Brenton Thwaites of 'Maleficent') is aboard a British sailing ship in pursuit of a pirate ship. Henry warns the captain in vain that he is pursuing a treacherous course into the Devil's Triangle as the ship approaches a tunnel in a mountain surrounded by a reef. The captain charges Henry with treason and has the youth clapped in irons. Not long afterward, the dreaded Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem of 'Skyfall') attacks his ship. They kill everybody aboard except Henry because they find Jack Sparrow wanted posters in his possession. Salazar allows Henry to live on the condition that he tell Jack Sparrow that he wants him. Furthermore, Salazar lets Henry live because he always sends one lone survivor back to tell the tale.Meantime, Sparrow and his pirate crew have sneaked into the township of St. Martin. They have come to rob the bank. The bank directors are celebrating the addition of new, impregnable vault that nobody can rob. When they open the formidable vault, the commotion awakens a sozzled Jack Sparrow who is inside it. The British fire a volley about the same time that Jack's crew has lashing the vault to a team of powerful horses. Whipping the steeds into action, they wind up hauling the whole bank along with the vault behind them! Jack Sparrow entangles his foot in one of the ropes, and he is dragged along behind it, blissfully guzzling rum from a bottle. Predictably, the British follow with muskets blazing. The trouble is the door to the vault doesn't shut and all the wealth in the vault spills out in a trail of golden bread crumbs that citizens scoop up. This qualifies as one of the best gags in this sprawling spectacle. Indeed, it recalls a similar robbery in 'Fast Five.' Later, after the British Navy recaptures Jack, they set out to decapitate him with a French guillotine. At the same time, the British are poised to hang an alleged witch, Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario of 'The Maze Runner'), because she claims to know how to read the stars as if they were a map. Not only does Henry believe she can lead him to the Trident, but also that Jack Sparrow has a compass that can aid them on the quest. Henry enlists the help of Sparrow's crew, and this escape sequence is both hilarious and exciting.The characters in 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' run the gamut of larger-than-life as well as larger-than-death. Salazar's zombie pirate crew are a CGI miracle. Most of his crew are missing fragments of their anatomy, some even their heads. The fifth installment in the 'Pirates' franchise will keep you shivering and snickering.",9,5,11,11 June 2017
K-19: The Widowmaker," Keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of its lengthy 138 minutes
","You have to wonder what Harrison Ford had on his mind when he decided to produce and star in the new Cold War submarine saga 'K-19: The Widowmaker.' Clearly, this catastrophic but conventional expose about a true-life incident in 1961, suppressed by the Kremlin until 1989, boasts everything anybody could hope for in a gripping disaster epic. During their historic maiden voyage on the first Soviet nuclear sub, the skipper and crew struggle desperately to repair the cooling system in its reactor after it repeatedly breaks down. Happily, the Soviet skipper and crew of K-19 solved this crisis before a cataclysmic thermonuclear blast could have vaporized them and triggered World War III. Not since Lewis Milestone's 'The North Star' (1943) or Jacques Tourneur's 'Days of Glory' (1944) has Hollywood celebrated the Communist exploits of the Soviet Union in such a heightened heroic fashion. The zombies of Joseph McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover, and anyone who championed the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s would rise from the dead and lynch the treasonous liberal revisionists who financed this better Red than dead yarn. Indeed, while this competently crafted, historically accurate, white-knuckled, undersea thriller won't win any Oscars, the filmmakers reveal a facet of the Cold War that few knew. Cross the Gene Hackman & Denzel Washington submarine nail-biter 'Crimson Tide' (1995) with the Jack Lemmon & Jane Fonda nuclear meltdown melodrama 'The China Syndrome' (1979), and you have a pretty good idea what to expect from Christopher Kyle's testosterone-fueled screenplay. 'K-19' opens as the Soviets commission their first atomic sub, so they can show the Kennedy administration that they can launch nuclear missiles at sea, too. Before the Russians take K-19 to sea, several construction workers die during freak accidents. Worse, the Kremlin replaces the commander, Capt. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson of 'Star Wars: Episode One'), with legendary Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford of 'Air Force One'), and this last minute change of command enrages an already superstitious crew. Meanwhile, Vostrikov ignores bad omens galore, like the champagne bottle bouncing off the hull rather than shattering at the christening, and sets out to chart history. Not long after they dive beneath the waves, Vostrikov learns K-19 is far from being ship-shape. Nevertheless, like the Hackman skipper in 'Crimson Tide,' Vostrikov runs his crew ragged with drills to sharpen their response time to emergencies. Suddenly, the worse thing that can happen occurs--the nuclear reactor overheats. Valiantly, the crew manages to cool the reactor. Not long afterward, however, the reactor blows another gasket, and the submariners stage a mutiny as a U.S. Navy destroyer lurks on the horizon.Director Kathryn Bigelow, whose credits include 'Near Dark' (1987) and 'Strange Days' (1995), adroitly piles one suspenseful situation atop another. Sixty-year old Harrison Ford makes a convincing but sympathetic Russian naval officer who refuses to scuttle the flagship of the Soviet fleet. Miraculously, despite its noble depiction of our former adversaries, 'K -19: The Widowmaker' manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for most of its lengthy 138 minutes.",8,3,5,11 July 2007
The Longest Day," Good War Movie!!!
","Producer Darryl F. Zanuck dreamed about making Cornelius Ryan's bestselling World War II book about the Allied invasion of Normandy into a major motion picture. Reportedly, Zanuck anted up $175-thousand to obtain the screen rights to Ryan's book. Nevertheless, neither Ryan nor Zanuck got along well with each other. Ostensibly, 'The Longest Day' represents the high water mark of World War II movies. No movie before it had the cast that this Twentieth Century Fox film boasted and afterward only 'A Bridge Too Far' and 'Battle of Britain' approached it in terms of prestige. The cast is truly legendary with luminaries like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, George Segal, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Curd Jürgens, Robert Ryan, Kenneth More, Gert Fröbe, Peter Lawford, Robert Wagner, and Stuart Whitman. Five directors helmed the sprawling action scenes, with Andrew Marton directing the American scenes, Ken Annakin handling the British scenes, and Bernhard Wicki lensing the German scenes. Most of what happens occurs in vignettes that feature a major star. The paratrooper scenes are incredible, especially when Red Button is trapped atop of a bell tower while his fellow jumpers landed in a square and were picked off by the Germans like fish in a barrel. The black & white cinematography adds an element of authenticity, and the whistling theme is classic. Interestingly enough, the Twentieth Century Fox logo with the searchlights is never shown in this film. Just as interestingly, despite all the participants of the actual battle who served as advisors, former top commanding general Dwight Eisenhower walked out of the film because so many technical errors were committed. 'The Longest Day' opens with the Allies mobilizing for the cross Channel invasion and keeping an eye on the weather. Reluctantly, Ike (Henry Grace) decides to commit the Allies to a landing during stormy weather. Essentially, the Allies caught the Germans sleeping and battered their way through enemy lines. The Allies dropped in dummies that activated and created noise designed to detract from the appearance of real soldiers. The dialogue is memorable, too.",8,1,3,22 September 2013
X-Men: Apocalypse," Another Great X-Men Adventure!!!
","Although it isn't coining the box office receipts that 'Captain America: Civil War' commanded, 'X-Men: Apocalypse' surpasses 'Captain America' with lavish spectacle, brinksmanship suspense, and fertile fantasy. Part of the reason is that Twentieth Century Fox produces the 'X-Men' movies, while Walt Disney Studios handles the 'Captain America' franchise. The 'X-Men' franchise displays greater edge and paranoia than the formulaic, facetious, Disney Marvel franchises. For example, the body count in 'The Usual Suspects' director Bryan Singer's latest Marvel Comics adventure 'X-Men: Apocalypse' is double, perhaps even triple that of 'Captain America.' 'Sherlock Holmes' scenarist Simon Kinberg and Singer have no problem with liquidating some X-Men characters. Meantime, Disney produces Marvel sagas where few super-heroes suffer permanent injury. The divide and take sides 'Captain America: Civil War' concluded in a stalemate with Cap and Iron Man playing patty-cake. The inescapable problem that Singer and Kinberg face in the ninth 'X-Men' franchise entry is predictability. The original 'X-Men' trilogy charted the story of Xavier's mutant super-heroes along chronological lines. The second 'X-Men' trilogy, starting with 'X-Men: First Class' (2011), then 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014), and finally 'X-Men: Apocalypse' ventures backward in time, examining the origins of various characters. 'X-Men: First Class' dealt with the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis, 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' unfolded at the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, and 'X-Men: Apocalypse' transpires in the 1980s. 'X-Men: Apocalypse' makes several allusions to 'X-Men: First Class' about Professor Xavier's romance with CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert. Since the second 'X-Men' trilogy occurs before the original trilogy, we know the principal characters are in little danger of annihilation. Nevertheless, Simon Kinberg's screenplays for those three films have all been imaginative, audacious, with the X-Men taking things to the brink. Clocking in at an extensive 144 minutes, 'X-Men: Apocalypse' doesn't wear out its welcome, and Singer doesn't short-change his packed ensemble cast. Furthermore, the malevolent Apocalypse in his first full-blown cinematic incarnation proves to be a challenging opponent. 'X-Men: Apocalypse' qualifies as a larger-than-life but slam-bang, sci-fi supernatural saga staged with considerable intellect, wit, and panache.'X-Men: Apocalypse' opens during a pharaoh's burial ceremony in ancient Egypt in 3,600 B.C. Naturally, Singer relies on spectacular CGI special effects galore to conjure up this vast, sprawling, ceremony as the first mutant, Apocalypse, finds himself betrayed by a duplicitous cabal. They trap Apocalypse in a pyramid, and the structure vanishes into the earth for 5,600 years until the 1980s when CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne of 'Bridesmaids') stumbles onto it. She finds a passage that leads to Apocalypse's burial chamber. A cult has been struggling to resurrect the notorious lord, and Apocalypse emerges from captivity to find the world greatly altered from his day. Dark and sinister, with tubes curving out of the back of his head, Apocalypse emerges as an ominous figure in a bizarre outfit. He saves a Cairo street thief, Ororo Munroe (Alexandra Shipp of 'Straight Outta Compton'), from two vigilantes. Eventually, Ororo will become Storm. He recruits a fallen angel, Angel (newcomer Ben Hardy), and Apocalypse transforms Angel's wings into steel so he has the ability to hurl razor-sharp metal feathers which are comparable to machetes. The most important recruit that Apocalypse attracts is Magneto, Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender of 'Prometheus'), who is in no mood to love mankind. Erik has suffered another great personal tragedy. During the intervening ten years since the events in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past,' Erik has maintained a low profile as a factory worker in Poland. Sadly, he is forced to reveal his mutant ability to manipulate metal when he saves a fellow factory worker from certain death. Unfortunately, the local authorities descend on him with bows & arrows. Magneto flees and joins Apocalypse. Apocalypse is appalled at everything that has transpired during his protracted absence, and he decides to change everything with the help of Erik, Storm, Angel, and a 'Wonder Woman' lookalike warrior Psylocke (Olivia Munn of 'Ride Along 2'), who boasts both telepathic and telekinetic abilities and dresses like a dominatrix. The collateral damage that Apocalypse and his henchmen create overwhelms the entire Disney Marvel Universe. Impudently, Apocalypse prompts all of the superpowers to launch their nuclear warheads into space where the ordinance will be useless and civilization will depend on the intervention of Professor Xavier (James McAvoy of 'Wanted') and the X-Men that are a lot younger than their predecessors. Happily, Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Raven, and Nicholas Hoult returns as Hank McCoy aka Beast.As exemplary as 'X-Men: Apocalypse' is, 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' still tops it, but the two movies differ in terms of scope. Director Bryan Singer isn't as enamored with the 1980s in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' as he was with the 1970s in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' He cuts back and forth between the heroes and the villains as they clash. This extravaganza serves up one good scene after another. Two of the best occur when Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters of 'Kick Ass') aka Quicksilver and Wolverine demonstrate their respective skills. Quicksilver embarks on a rescue mission at Xavier's School for Gifted Children after the building comes under attack. Quicksilver darts about like a wraith snatching somebody here and seizing somebody there, before the house collapses in a pile of smoking rubble. This scene provides some genuine levity in the middle of Apocalypse's devastating plans to renovate planet Earth. Without divulging too much information, Wolverine's solitary scene is as savage as it is sensational. The grand finale between Charles and Apocalypse is a drawn-out, but exciting exercise that drums up white-knuckled suspense. The evil first mutant intends to freight his consciousness into Xavier's body and then appropriate Xavier's gift to connect with everybody's mind on the planet. While Charles and Apocalypse tangle like maniacs, the X-Men have their hands full with Apocalypse's Four Horsemen.If you haven't kept up with the 'X-Men' cinematic universe, you may find its plot difficult to follow.",10,20,34,7 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Better Than Its Predecessor But Too L-o-n-g!!!
","Although it surpasses its predecessor, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' suffers from too many villains. Meantime, audiences should prepare themselves for more narrative tweaking on the part of '(500) Days of Summer' director Marc Webb, 'Star Trek' writers Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci, and 'Fringe' scribe Jeff Pinkner to the classic Marvel Comics characters created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko back in August 1962. Initially, 'Evil Dead' director Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' trilogy coupled Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker with Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson, while the Andrew Garfield reboot pairs Peter with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. Technically, in the comics, Gwen was Peter Parker's first love. Clearly, Webb's reboot shows more fidelity to the comics than the original Raimi trilogy. Peter and Gwen were dating before our hero met Mary Jane. Comparably, Superman has two comic book love interests: Lois Lane and Lana Lang. Mind you, Lois has dominated the movies. This time around the tweaking involves a villain that Tobey Maguire tangled with in his first web-crawling chronicle. Of course, people don't watch 'Spider-man' movies, or any superhero saga, to agonize over the fate of the invincible entity. We show up for the latest outlandish villain, their origin story, the inevitable showdown with Spider-Man, and pyrotechnical constellation of special effects. Imitating the Warner Brothers' Batman franchise, Webb and company pit Spidey against three villains to keep him busy throughout this occasionally tedious two hour and twenty minute plus pandemonium. Judged by this criterion, 'Amazing Spider-Man 2' trumps its one-adversary predecessor with a triple threat treat. Happily, Jamie Fox's glowering Electro, Dane DeHaan's bizarre Green Goblin, and Paul Giamatti's obstreperous Rhino are far livelier than Rhys Ifans' dreary Lizard. Electro puts up the fiercest fight. Green Goblin doesn't match Electro in terms of actual combat, but he contributes to the worst thing that happens in the third act. Indeed, the allure then is not just for the adversaries but also for the hero's closest friends. Apart from Sally Fields' indestructible Aunt May, Gwen Stacy is the only other hold-over from the 2012 original. Webb and his writers add a wrinkle that raises the romance above its usual peripheral subplot status. Everything that Spider-Man does has consequences for Gwen. Naturally, a superhero spends his life negotiating an obstacle course, and the love interest complicates matters. Spider-Man worries about Gwen not so much because he loves her. We're reminded Spider-Man swore an oath to her gruff father, the late Captain Stacy, that he would stay out of her life. Every time he turns around, Spider-Man sees the specter of Captain Stacy frowning at him and this haunts him. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' opens about the same time as its predecessor, with a juvenile Peter in his parents' house. All we know from the original is that Richard Parker (Campbell Scott of 'Dying Young') and his wife deposited Peter at the house of his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. In the sequel, we see what else happened after they left Peter and boarded a private jet to Switzerland. This scene reminded me of the opening scene aboard a plane in the James Bond movie 'Moonraker.' Anyway, as far as we know, the Parkers perished in a plane crash, but anything—you know—can happen in a cinematic superhero franchise. The action resumes with Spider-Man arriving in the nick of time to pick up his diploma at his high school graduation after thwarting a fanatical Russian criminal, Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti of 'Rock of Ages'), from stealing plutonium vials during a runaway chase through Times Square. This exhilarating demolition derby with Aleksei careening through downtown Manhatten traffic in a tow-truck hauling an armored car gets everything on off on the right foot. During this mayhem, Spider-Man saves Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx of 'Django Unchained') from being struck by Sytsevich. Afterward, we are introduced to one of Peter's closest friends, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan of 'Lawless'), who haven't seen Peter for a decade. Comparatively, DeHaan doesn't eclipse James Franco from the Maguire trilogy. Oscorp executive Donald Menken (Colm Feore of 'Pearl Harbor') ushers Harry to the bed of his dying father, Norman (Chris Cooper of 'Money Train'), who bears bad tidings to his son. Meantime, Max plunges accidentally into a tank at Oscorp and is bitten by genetically adapted electric eels. Eventually, Max mutates into the electrifying villain Electro who generates no end of problems for Spider-Man as well as the city electric company.Once again, Garfield outshines Maguire as the costume-clad champion, even though it is obvious that Garfield, an Englishman in his thirties, doesn't look like an angst-afflicted teen. The twentysomething Stone is as luminous as ever as Gwen, but she is too old to be playing a teen, too. Nevertheless, this sympathetic couple shares enough chemistry and radiates enough charisma that it is easy for us to overlook their age disparity. Meanwhile, you'll have to suspend your disbelief because the larger-than-life antics could never occur in the real world. Indeed, Electro qualifies as an unusual villain, driven by revenge, who can materialize seemingly at will whenever and wherever he wants like a wraith. The showdown in Times Square with Spider-Man where Electro tries to electrocute everybody crackles with thrills and chills. Battling Electro alone would have been more than sufficient for 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,' but Webb and his writers unleash the nefarious Green Goblin while Gwen insists on helping Spider-Man despite the consequences. You could probably shove your finger into a light socket and experience the same effect that this noisy, ambitious, vertigo-inducing, sci-fi fantasy delivers with gusto. The OMG prosthetic make-up and visual effects are nothing short of stunning. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' doesn't know when to quit, and it leaves us breathless after a supreme tragedy to soldier on with our webslinger hero poised to battle one more adversary.",8,1,10,12 May 2014
Ex Machina," One of the Best Android Epics Ever
","Nightmares won't afflict you after watching the subtle but suspenseful science fiction fright flick 'Ex Machina' about a sentient robot with enough cunning to escape from its laboratory confinement. This cautionary futuristic fable about artificial intelligence dramatizes the quintessential question that all classic robot movies ponder: can man design a robot that is not only conscious of the world around it but also has awareness of itself? In his dazzling directorial debut, British novelist-turned-scribe Alex Garland refuses to overwhelm us with a spectacular 'Star Wars' style universe as a setting, but relies rather on the sheer simplicity of a condo lab facility nestled in the middle of a remote mountain paradise. This ultra-literate, atmosphere-laden chiller, with just enough full-frontal female nudity to garner an R-rating, occurs in the near future, not a decade down in the road but right around the corner. Although it is a foregone conclusion that the robot will triumph over her creator and break out of captivity, Garland's staging of the action building up to the escape is as hypnotic as his gifted cast with Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac as the humans and Alicia Vikander and Sonoya Mizuno as the automatons. Sci-fi aficionados should know that Garland has disposed of Isaac Asimov's three rules of robotics for this dystopian tale. At 107 minutes, 'Ex Machina' amounts to more of a contemplative, indie-style, art film rather than an obnoxious, ear-splitting, Hollywood blockbuster. Mind you, 'Ex Machina' depends on a wealth of computer-generated special effects, but nobody wields plasma pistols or ducks into a time machine. Watching this movie is comparable to being mesmerized by a beady-eyed rattlesnake in an immense glass jar and then wondering what will happen if you put your hand on the glass. Clearly, Garland has seen all the notable robot movies, such as 'Metropolis,' 'Forbidden Planet,' '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'Blade Runner,' 'Short Circuit,' 'I, Robot,' and 'Her,' and he is familiar with the formula. Imagine a no-frills version of Steven Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence' (2001) transpiring entirely in a laboratory setting with two human characters, one more sinister than the other, and you've got the gist of 'Ex-Machina.' Garland's film unfolds with a brief prologue in New York City. Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson of 'Unbroken') is a nerdy, sandy-haired, 24-year old, Internet programmer who works at a global computer search engine company named BlueBook. Comparatively, the gigantic BlueBook dwarfs Google. Smith wins a lottery inside the company to spend a week with his reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac of 'Sucker Punch'), who lives alone in a secluded research facility. Suffering from a God complex, Nathan seems to be channeling Dr. Frankenstein; indeed, he named his company after Frankenstein's notebooks. He flies Caleb in by helicopter because his laboratory is basically inaccessible. One look at Nathan and you'll know that he is looney. He sports a bushy beard and has his hair buzz-cut to his scalp so it looks like gunpowder. Heavy black horn-rimmed spectacles straddle his nose, and he blurts words like 'cool' and 'dude' in an effort to sound like an everyday, ordinary geek. We learn during the conversations between Nathan and Caleb that Nathan is a teenage progeny who wrote computer code at age thirteen and now owns the biggest search engine company in the world. Meantime, Nathan implores Caleb to treat him like a pal. Essentially, Nathan has summoned Caleb to participate in a 'Turing' test, named after the real-life Alan Turing, the genius whose life was chronicled recently in the World War II movie 'The Imitation Game.' Nathan has designed a truly sophisticated, female-gendered robot that he calls Ava (Alicia Vikander of 'Son of a Gun') and has even endowed her with appropriate genitalia. Nathan wants Caleb to determine if Ava is self aware or merely simulating self-awareness. Ava looks like no other android in cinematic history. She has soft, delicately sculpted distaff facial features with slender human hands while the rest of her body consists of exposed wiring housed in a see-through mesh structure. Bits and pieces of the exposition from this epic make the story really compelling. For example, our mad scientist billionaire has drawn on thought patterns appropriated from data generated by computer search engines. Most search engine corporations content themselves strictly to monetize their information about what consumers want. On the other hand, our wily villain concerns himself with how people search for their needs rather than the needs and then he exploited this information to enable his robot to behave like a human.It doesn't take impressionable Caleb long to fall in love with Ava, and Nathan is monitoring their every move. He has surveillance cameras planted in every room so that he misses nothing. Ava wants so desperately to get out Nathan's laboratory that she turns Caleb against his boss. Eventually, Caleb learns that Ava represents just another prototype in Nathan's chain of robots. Indeed, Nathan reveals how he plans to download Ava's brain into another automaton and scrap her memories. This seals Nathan's fate as far as Caleb is concerned, and he decides to help Ava find her freedom. Before 'Ex Machina' fades out, Caleb and Nathan are no longer friends, and Ava has acquired the upper hand, farther up than even her perceptive creator has imagined. Moreover, Ava has turned Nathan's personal sex robot Kyoko against him; Kyoko enjoys the freedom to roam around Nathan's research condo. When he isn't satisfying his sexual urges with her, Nathan uses her as a personal servant. Most of 'Ex Machina' involves apparently monotonous conversations between either Caleb and Nathan or Caleb and Ava. Nevertheless, Garland insinuates enough interesting dialogue into those exchanges to make them more than just loquacious chatter. The performances are robust, with Isaac and Vikander taking top honors respectively as the villainous Nathan and the deceptive Ava. Sonoya Mizuno deserves honorable mention as the mute robot Kyoko who performs the most sensational act. Don't mistake 'Ex Machina' for a run-of-the-mill female robot actioneer.",9,4,11,25 April 2015
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," The Sequel Without Fangs Still Sucks You Into Its Fantasy
","The suspenseful 'Twilight' sequel 'New Moon' picks up where the original film concluded with Bella still begging Edward to change her into a vampire. Like any worthwhile sequel, 'New Moon' develops the complications that our hero and heroine face and provides deeper insight not available within the narrative confines of 'Twilight.' Poor sequels replicate originals as if to prove that their predecessors weren't flukes. Good sequels broaden their narrative base, depict characters in more facets, and ultimately surpass the original in overall concept. 'New Moon' succeeds splendidly in all respects. The werewolf transformations that occur in the second half-hour bolster the supernatural elements because an individual shape-shifts into a gigantic wolf as they leap into the air. What the werewolves lack in urbanity compared with the vampires, they make up for with their larger-than-life size and ferocity. Of course, nothing in 'New Moon' should induce nightmares and paranoia in the real world because the filmmakers keep everything PG-13 mellow. You never get a glimpse of vampire fangs. Furthermore, the werewolves are more majestic than terrifying. 'The Golden Compass' director Chris Weitz and 'Step Up' scenarist Melissa Rosenberg introduce the equivalent of the vampire Supreme Court in this installment. According to protagonist Edward Cullen, the Volturi lay down the law for vampires. Chiefly, a vampire may face death at the hands of the Volturi for failing to keep their existence a secret. 'We don't make spectacles of ourselves,' Edward explains to Bella, 'and we don't kill conspicuously.' Like most sequels, characters that appeared in the first one bite the dust in this one. You'll find out soon enough who goes bye bye.'New Moon' dwells on the themes of death, old age, and suicide. Bella is desperate to become a vampire, but Edward resists her pleas to change her. The greatest character growth in the franchise occurs when Jacob (Taylor Lautner) changes from a harmless kid to Mr. Hunk. While 'Twilight' concerned an interspecies romance between a female human and a male vampire, 'New Moon' takes the relationship to a different place. The hero and heroine lose each other in a sense, but Bella is inconsolable with grief when Edward abandons her for her own good. Consequently, she behaves recklessly until she learns the truth about Edward. Vampire movie buffs may turn their collective noses up in contempt for this soft vampire epic. Again, the vampires never bare their fangs and they don't sleep in coffins. Indeed, 'Twilight' author Stephenie Meyer follows the Bela Lugosi vampire formula. All the vampires look young, sexy, and craving to crunch neck. They aren't worried about anybody remotely resembling Van Helsing. Moreover, 'New Moon' is basically a status quo values movie. As much as Bella yearns to be changed, most of the characters--especially the vampires--don't think that she should. In other respects, 'New Moon' is entirely predictable in terms of romantic melodrama. Young love flourished in the first one, but it came with a price. Young love curdles in the sequel. Think of 'Twilight' as gal gets guy and guy gets gal. 'New Moon' strains the relationship and it's gal loses guy and guy loses gal.",10,0,7,8 July 2010
Patton," The Essence of A Modern-Day Warrior
","Few Hollywood biographies capture the ambiguities of the person it portrays, but 'Planet of the Apes' director Franklin J. Schaffner's biography of General George S. Patton proved the exception to the rule. 'Patton' received seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Art & Set Direction, and garnered nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, and Best Original Music. Repeated screenings of this extraordinary World War II epic combat film, especially George C. Scott's bravura performance, make it difficult to believe that producer Frank McCarthy toiled for 19 years to persuade the Pentagon as well as General Patton's family, both adamantly opposed to it, to help him produce this multi-faceted film. Scenarist Francis Ford Coppola, long before he made his own masterpiece 'Apocalypse Now,' penned one of the earliest versions of the 'Patton' script and realized the deadly pitfalls that lay in the subject matter for any filmmaker. 'Wait a minute, this guy was obviously nuts. If they want to make a film glorifying him as a great American hero, it will be laughed at. And if I write a film that condemns him, it won't be made at all.' Coppola encapsulated the contradictions that confronted McCarthy for nearly twenty years. According to Coppola, only George C. Scott's intervention brought Coppola's long since rejected elements back into the film, particularly the stunning opening with Scott poised in from a gigantic American flag delivering his stirring speech to the troops.Initially, the Patton family opposed 'Patton,' and McCarthy recalled the rage of Colonel George S. Patton III who threatened shoot anybody who made a movie about his father. Indeed, Twentieth Century Fox shelved 'Patton' in 1951 and Warner Brothers following in their footsteps in 1953 not only because the family did not trust the filmmakers, but also because the Pentagon felt any film about Patton would portray the Army in an offensive manner, particularly because the general emerged as such a controversial figure. The family interpreted any movie as an invasion of privacy, lobbied the Pentagon to deny cooperation to filmmakers, and even launched a law suit. Eventually, the Defense Department cooperated, but it provided none of the equipment that appeared in the film. The Spanish Army furnished the tanks, equipment, and troops for the battle sequences. Patton's daughter Ruth Ellen Totten dropped the law suit after she saw Schaffner's film. Reportedly, Totten told her attorneys, 'Call off the dogs.' She gushed about it. 'I think that it is the best movie I have ever seen since Gone with the Wind.' Totten added brother George was thrilled by Scott's portrayal.The positive reception of 'Patton' seems almost inevitable in light of the authenticity of Schaffner's film. McCarthy scored a coup when he convinced General of the Army Omar N. Bradley to serve as 'senior military adviser. Bradley scrutinized the script and later took McCarthy and Schaffner on a tour of the battlefields in Belgium, France, and Tunisia, so Schaffner was confident that 'we didn't do anything which was outrageous or silly.' However, McCarthy had to purchase Bradley's memoirs to obtain his services. Inevitably, 'Patton' compared its insane, quixotic hero with Bradley's more down-to-earth, humanitarian general. Four-star General Paul Harkins, who had been Patton's chief of staff, joined Bradley as another military adviser. These two figures placated the earliest anxieties that the Patton family had about the production.Clocking in at walloping 169 minutes, 'Patton' depicted the celebrated general as an amalgamation of contradictions. He was religious but profane. He was violent but sentimental. George C. Scott perused Patton books and watched news reel films. Indeed, Scott transformed his appearance to resemble the general. Totten called Scott's portrayal 'tour de force.' Winning the acceptance of the Patton family and the military proved one part. Twentieth Century Fox had to win over moviegoers during the era of the Vietnam War with most people agreed that the nation has lost the war. Co-scenarist Edmund North summarized what attracted audiences divided over Vietnam to 'Patton': 'I believe it was because each person brought to it his own underlying feelings about the Vietnam war.' Those who were appalled by Vietnam interpreted 'Patton' a fascinating anti-hero. Those—like Richard Nixon—who regarded Vietnam as a noble enterprise could find comfort and support in Patton's self-righteous and dedicated savagery.' President Nixon watched 'Patton' twice and admired the general's arch-authoritarian attitude. Later, Nixon denied in an interview with David Frost in 1977 that the film 'Patton' had inspired him to launch his Cambodian invasion Cambodia five days after watching Patton the second time. The film has many memorable moments, especially Patton's orders to a chaplain to intervene with God with a prayer for good weather and the scene in the desert when Patton leaps out of a window to fire on a German aircraft. Karl Mauldin is fabulous as General Bradley and there are tanks galore. Every World War II fan should put 'Patton' on their required viewing list of movies.",10,2,4,10 April 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Tops The Original
","'The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer' (**** out of ****) qualifies as fabulous, often funny, family-friendly fare. Not only does the second installment in the far-fetched, formula-driven, Marvel Comics fantasy franchise provide a refresher course for those who've forgotten the first film, but this Twentieth Century Fox release also introduces a new character. This time around Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Childis) tangle with a villain that dwarfs even the maniacally evil Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) and find themselves struggling to save the Earth from an apocalypse like nothing that they faced in the original. The computer-generated special effects are first-rate, unlike those in 'Spider-Man 3,' but the CGI as well as the apocalyptic plot never overshadow the characters and the tensions that their comic camaraderie conjures up. Invisible Girl Sue Storm still scolds rubbery Mr. Fantastic Reed Richards about his nerdy obsession for all things scientific, while incendiary Johnny Storm cannot rib the granite-hard Ben Grimm enough about his stony countenance. Director Tim Story, who helmed the breezy lightweight original, knows one thing that other summer movie directors could learn. Namely, too much of a good thing is not always a good thing. Clocking in at a short and snappy 89 minutes, the new 'Fantastic Four' adventure allows you barely enough time to drain a barrel-sized soft drink before you have to drain something else.'The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer' opens ominously enough as an unknown power plows its way inexorably through the galaxy and destroys one planet after another to assuage its awesome appetite for energy. While this mystifying might is wending its way toward Earth, everybody on the planet is counting down the hours to the most anticipated marriage in history between Reed Richards and Sue Storm. Eventually, the strange force from another galaxy enters Earth's atmosphere. This inexplicable anomaly shocks Japanese sailors in Suruga Bay, Japan, when it solidifies the waters that they fish in and then surprises tourists in Giza, Egypt, when it sprinkles snow flakes on the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. Flashing like a white-hot meteor over Los Angeles, it plunges the City of Angels into a startling black-out. The Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon interpret this meteorological mayhem as a military threat, and they dispatch blunt General Hager (Andre Braugher of TV's 'Homicide') to solicit the help of Reed Richards. The Pentagon wants to know where this force will strike next. Reed agrees on the sly to create a sensor that will detect it while he prepares for his upcoming marriage to Sue.Sue and Reed are poised in front of the preacher when the bizarre comet strikes New York City, turns their lavish Manhattan wedding into chaos, and melts down Reed's sensor apparatus without warning. Reluctantly, Johnny Storm incinerates his wedding tuxedo to pursue the object. No sooner has Johnny launched himself into flight like a fireball than the intruder assumes the form of a chrome-plated Ken doll riding a metallic surf board. This extraterrestrial literally takes Johnny by surprise and seizes him by the throat in a death grip and then escorts him into outer space. The Human Torch cries uncle, and his opponent allows him to plunge back to Earth. This encounter affects Johnny adversely because he can no longer confine his power to himself. He touches The Thing at one point, and The Thing turns into The Human Torch. Vice-versa, Johnny transforms hilariously into the Thing. Later, Johnny touches Sue, and she bursts into flames while he vanishes. Unbeknownst to our heroes, the Silver Surfer took a short-cut earlier over Latveria, where Victor Von Doom had been exiled for the duration at the end of the first film, and thawed out the evildoer. Initially, nothing that the Fantastic Four does thwarts the Silver Surfer, so General Hager invites Victor, much to the chagrin of our heroes, to help out. Victor reveals that the source of the enigmatic Surfer's power lies in his surfboard. Reed concocts a pulse gadget that our heroes to hope to separate the Surfer (a CGI effect with the husky voice of 'Matrix' star Laurence Fishburne) from his surf board. Meanwhile, despite his willingness to help his former foes, Victor has something else up his sleeve that augurs ill for everybody.Indeed, the formulaic Don Payne & Mark Frost screenplay is pure 'Fantastic Four' with the usual time out allotted for our ensemble's amusing antics with each other as well as some new gadgets. Reed Richards' elastic gyration on the dance floor with a couple of babes on either arm during his stag party generates a side-splitting sight gag. Only one character of importance perishes in this sequel but his demise is rather grisly considering the PG-rating. Nevertheless, director Tim Story never lets the action take a breather and keeps things bang-slamming ahead to an explosive finale. Reportedly, the two 'Fantastic Four' movies have remained largely faithful to its Stan Lee and Jack Kirby origins more than any other series, and durable Stan makes another cameo as himself. Predictably, this enjoyable entry winds up with a happy ending that leaves things open for another sequel.",10,12,22,20 June 2007
Transformers," An improbable but compelling science fiction fantasy thriller
","'Armageddon' director Michael Bay blends live-action human heroics seamlessly with top-notch, computer-generated images of huge extraterrestrial robots battling for supremacy of the Earth in his new movie 'Transformers' (*** out of ****), an improbable but compelling science fiction fantasy thriller about good versus evil robots. Essentially, this spectacular, often amusing, and sometimes inventive, $150-million dollar hokum amounts to a glossy cinematic commercial for toy giant Hasbro. Like the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,' 'Transformers' materialized first in the early 1980s as a line of toys. Later, the profitable Hasbro figurines graduated to the small screen in an animated television series. Since then, fifteen 'Transformers' TV series have been appeared in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. In 1986, these shape-shifting robots showed up in their own animated theatrical length feature appropriately entitled 'Transformers: The Movie.' Finally, these wrestling space alien robots have reached the big screen in a larger-than-life, two-and-a-half-hour plus summer extravaganza with 'I, Robot' star Shia LaBeouf. 'Mission Impossible 3' scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with director Bay, have given the mythological origins of 'Transformers' a makeover of sorts. Of course, anytime Hollywood buys a franchise, either toy or otherwise, the studios inevitably make alterations. Meanwhile, seasoned sci-fi movie fans will spot the obvious homages to Steven Spielberg movies, like 'E.T.' and those of Spielberg collaborator Joe Dante.'Transformers' erupts with action and rarely bogs down during its mammoth 144 minute running time. A sinister U.S. military helicopter makes an unauthorized landing at an Army base in the Middle East. When the occupants fail to identify themselves, U.S. soldiers unleash a withering barrage of gunfire. Suddenly, the helicopter rears up, transforms itself into a towering two-legged alien monster and rampages through the base. While this gigantic robots is eradicating every soul in sight in 'Independence Day' style, a smaller robot pops out and hacks into the base's Pentagon computers. A group of soldiers, among them Capt. Lennox (Josh Duhamel of 'Turistas') and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson of '2 Fast 2 Furious'), survive this slaughter and eventually contact Secretary of War Joe Keller (Jon Voight of 'Anaconda') who orchestrates an across-the-board defense. Keller assembles the best hackers in the world to crack the alien's code. The opening scene and subsequent scenes that alternate between the Army and the hackers resemble something out of serious Ridley Scott movie like the R-rated 'Black Hawk Down.' Clearly, as big, dumb, and ear shattering as 'Transformers' is, Bay has spared nothing to make it look like the jaw-dropping event of the summer.No sooner has 'Transformers' delivered its white-knuckled, off-the-Richter-scale opening action gambit than Bay shifts from a serious style Ridley Scott saga into a warm-hearted but sardonic Joe Dante movie. Dante directed 'Gremlins,' 'Gremlins 2,' 'Explorers,' and 'Small Soldiers.' Dante's sci-fi comedies rely on a near teen or teenaged hero who has problems impressing the opposite sex. Enter Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf of 'Disturbia'), a nerdy eleven grader who gets no respect. He is keyed up about the prospect of getting his first set of wheels. This rite of passage occurs on Bobby Bolivia's used car lot where Bobby (Bernie Mac of 'Ocean's Thirteen') sells Sam's father Ron (Kevin Dunn of 'Small Soldiers') a battered yellow Camaro for $5-thousand dollars. Bobby is a heck of a car dealer when you consider that the Camaro drove itself onto his lot. Anyway, the Camaro becomes a babe magnet for Sam, and high school bombshell Mikaela Banes (Tennessee-native Meagan Fox) starts hanging out with our hero. Meanwhile, Sam learns that his Camaro possesses a mind of its own. One night his Chervolet cranks itself up and careens off without warning. Sam straddles his bicycle and pedals after his car in furious pursuit. When he catches up with his Camaro, he discovers that it evidently had abducted itself instead being stolen as Sam had feared. Not surprisingly, Sam freaks out when his Camaro turns into a giant robot and speaks to him.Basically, in 'Transformers,' two types of robots have come to Planet Earth to search for a mysterious cube. The good robots are the Autobots, and they include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz, and Ratchet. Sam's Camaro transforms itself into Bumblebee. Meanwhile, the evil robots are the Decepticons, and they consist of Megatron, Starscream, Blackout, Brawl, Barricade, Frenzy, Bonecrusher, and Scorponok. The Autobots and the Decepticons both know about Sam's scientific ancestor who met Megatron initially before the villainous robot encountered some difficulty of its own. Suffice to say that Sam has something very important that both robot armies need. The Autobots are willing to cooperate with humans, but Decepticons want to destroy them. Predictably, the Autobots team up with mankind to fight the Decepticons. Los Angeles becomes the arena for a giant smack down wrestling match between these awesome space aliens.Anybody that has seen either the 'Transformers' TV series or owned the Hasbro figurines may complain about the liberties that Bay and his writers have taken with the franchise. For example, the scene at Hoover Dam and the history behind the dam played no part in the original 'Transformers.' Happily, Peter Cullen, who provided the voice for Optimus Prime in the TV series, reprises his role, while 'The Matrix's' Hugo Weaving voices Megatron. Aside from a couple of loony, over-the-top performances by Jon Voight as the Defense Secretary and John Turturro as a crazy government agent, everybody else plays it fairly straightforward. George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic special effects company has furnished some of the best CGI graphics ever seen on the big-screen. Just watching the 'Transformers' do their thing is worth the price of admission. Mind you, it's kid's stuff, but it doesn't look like kid's stuff. Altogether, this testosterone-fueled fantasy is ideal summer entertainment for those who want to relive their 'Transformers' memories or for sci-fi fans that want to see computer-generated animation ascend to the next level.",9,1,4,18 July 2007
Men in Black II," 'Men In Black 2' knows to quit while it is ahead.
","Sequels, or the cinematic spawn of Hollywood blockbusters, constitute an entire film genre of their own. The best reunite the entire original cast and crew. Think of the 'Lethal Weapon' epics. All the chief characters return in the best sequels. Remember 'The Adams Family,' 'Beverly Hills Cop 2,' or 'Smokey and the Bandit 2?' Not only do the best sequels raise the emotional stakes, but also they feature an antagonist twice as savvy as the original foe. Look at the James Bond movies, the 'Indiana Jones,' 'Evil Dead,' and 'Rambo' trilogies. The best sequels take you beyond the original. Consider the 'Star Trek' series or the 'Back To The Future' trilogy. The worst sequels recycle the original material without imagination. Remember 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes,' 'Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,' or 'Crocodile Dundee 2?' The worse sequels jettison main characters for lame excuses. Chris Tucker's absence in 'Next Friday' is intolerable! The 'Rocky' movies killed off secondary characters in each sequel. The worst sequels cannot recapture the spontaneity of the original. Recall 'Weekend at Bernie's 2?' The worst sequels usually contain only half of sure-fire elements that sparked the original. Remember 'Ghostbusters 2,' 'Smokey and the Bandit 3,' 'Beverly Hills Cop 3,' 'Crocodile Dundee 3,' and 'Exorcist 2?'The new sequel to 'Men In Black' (1997), the numerically specific 'Men In Black 2,' brings back Will Smith as Agent J, Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K, and their 'MiB' boss Zed (Rip Torn of 'Freddy Got Fingered') as well as several Dr. Seuss-style extraterrestrial wiseacre worms. The 'Elle' character that Linda Fiorentino played, the morgue attendant who teamed up with Agent J at fadeout, has gone back to the morgue. Agent J has become a 'Dirty Harry' of sorts and has a hard time keeping a partner. The predictable follow-the-numbers, up-against-a- deadline, end-of-the-planet screenplay by Robert Gordon of 'Galaxy Quest' and Barry Fanaro of 'Kingpin' lacks the wit, whimsy, and the wonder of the original 'Men In Black.' The 'X-Files' meets 'Dragnet' quality of 'Men In Black' doesn't seem as funny as it did five years ago.When the alien villainous Serleena crashes her UFO in Central Park, she takes the shape of a sexy Victoria Secret's model (Laura Flynn Boyle) and threatens the planet with destruction unless she acquires the legendary 'Light of Zartha.' Think of the Medusa with snakes for hair and you've got a good idea what Serleena resembles. Desperately, Zed dispatches J to reactivate K. As Kevin Brown, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has been stacking mail for the U.S. Post Office, since Agent J 'neuralized' him in the original. The superb comic chemistry between silly-minded Agent J and sour-pussed Agent K qualifies as the best reason to watch this okay but anemic opus. Director Barry Sonnefeld, who helmed the original 'Men In Black,' lets nothing --especially storyline--interfere with either the wacky action or his outlandish computer-generated bugs and worms. At 88 trim minutes, 'Men In Black 2' knows to quit while it is ahead.",7,3,6,11 July 2007
1917," One of the Most Memorable World War I Movies
","Two young British Infantry corporals receive orders from their Company Commander in director Sam Mendes' gripping, often surreal World War I movie '1917' to deliver an urgent message to rescind a planned frontal attack on enemy positions on the Western Front. These two, clean-cut, lads embark on a genuine journey of hardship that nobody expects them to carry out and brave an obstacle course teeming with ravenous rats, lethal German snipers, while their own men try to sidetrack them. The action takes place in trenches, trucks, rivers, forests, and the remains of bombed out villages. Furthermore, they have only so much time to accomplish their mission, and the odds are stacked against them from the start. Heroism has rarely been portrayed in such realistic terms. Moreover, these two boys aren't trigger-happy, bloodthirsty killers, but naÃ¯ve souls who don't have a clue what they have volunteered for once they forge ahead. The tragic catch is that only one of them will survive this nightmare. The one who dies doesn't die shooting it out with German soldiers. Instead, he will die trying to help a downed German aviator escape from his crashed biplane before its flaming fuselage incinerates him. '1917' captures the horror of the War to End All Wars as it was called by the politicians. Although 'Apocalypse Now' dealt with the Vietnam War, the two movies reflect the futility of war as well as the humanity of their young men who bore arms in the conflict. What these two fellows experience is unforgettable, but it doesn't depict gung-ho heroics. Instead, men scramble to stay alive and often behave like cowards. Everywhere these two Brits go, they see the many faces of death. Rivers are choked with bloating, ashen-faced corpses, but director Sam Mendes resists the urge to show soldiers getting blown to smithereens or tangled up in their own guts like Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan.'
When a British sergeant orders Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman of 'The King') to pick somebody to accompany him to headquarters, he doesn't think twice about taking his friend Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay of 'Defiance') with him. Schofield isn't especially enthusiastic about the prospect that awaits them, but he tags along with Blake to the C.O.'s tent. General Erinmore (Colin Firth of 'Kingsman: The Secret Service') shows them several maps of the Western Front as well as aerial photographs and explains that the Germans have abandoned their trenches. Initially, the High Command thought this represented a triumph. Instead, Erinmore explains the Germans not only deliberately left the battlefield, but also these sly Huns are orchestrating a Trojan Horse trap. When the British launch their next attack, they will be unwittingly feeding their troops into a German meat grinder. As it turns out, Corporal Blake has been chosen not only for his map reading skills, but also because his brother, Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden of 'Rocketman'), will die in the attack if it isn't halted. Corporal Blake has more incentive that anybody else under Erinmore's command, and the General calculates that this will enable him to complete the mission.
'1917' is a sprawling, epic saga, and we're drawn into their plight, because we're following them every bloody step of the way. 'Skyfall' director Sam Mendes and 'Brazil' lenser Roger Deakins present this incredible mission as it unfolds on April 6, 1917. The film has a documentary feel to it, especially when our protagonists shoulder their way through fellow troops lining the infinite labyrinth of trenches. Each face tells a terrible story, and the officers hold out little hope for survival. Initially, during the first twenty minutes, Blake and Schofield are stunned by the uncanny silence that hangs ominously over the abandoned enemy trenches. Rats the size of racoons scavenge among the kitbags of food left behind by the Germans. Our two lads gaze in stupefaction at dozens of artillery pieces which the Huns have spiked in their urgency to retreat. At one point, the Brits enter a tunnel that appears to serve as a shortcut through this eerie no-man's land. One huge rat dragging a bag of food catches on a tripwire, and an explosion buries Schofield, and Blake digs him frantically out of the rubble. These guys were prepared to fight the Germans, but they had no idea a hungry rodent could pose such danger. Everywhere they go, no matter how desolate it appears, our protagonists discover nothing is what it seems. Death lurks everywhere, especially where they least expect it.
About forty-five minutes into '1917,' after one of the two protagonists has been killed, the other realizes his life literally hangs by a thread. He catches a ride in a truck with other British soldiers, but they are heading in the wrong direction, so he must leave them where a collapsed bridge marks their point of departure. No sooner has he parted company with them than a German sniper starts blasting away at him. Scenes like this spawn white-knuckled tension, and both combatants never really see each other until our hero silences the sniper. When our protagonists embarked on their mission, they were loaded down like pack mules with ordinance and rations. By the time the surviving Brit spots the men he is supposed to save, he has only his uniform to prove he is British. Incredibly, he learns to his chagrin a glory hound of an officer may ignore his message that he has literally died for to deliver. Earlier, when he lost most of what he was lugging along with him, our lone soldier dived into a river to elude enemy fire. Swept downstream, he winds up caught up in a logjam of rotting, bloated corpses that prevent further progress. A night in a bombed-out village has a hallucinatory quality as flares burst repeatedly above the buildings, and their skeletal remains ripple with spooky shadows. By the time our hero attains his objective, you'll feel as traumatized by this spectacle as he is",10,4,8,25 January 2020
Rules of Engagement," John Wayne would roll over in his grave if he saw 'Rules of Engagement'
","John ('Sands of Iwo Jima') Wayne would roll over in his grave if he saw what director William Friedkin's 'Rules of Engagement' does to the Marine Corp. This anti-climactic but patriotic 'Semper Fi' Rules concerns a heroic, 30-year veteran, Col. Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), charged with murder when he orders his leathernecks to fire at an armed and angry mob threatening the U.S. Embassy in Yemen is gung-ho hokum. Not only do we know from the start that Childers did the right thing, but also scenarist Stephen (TV's 'The Practice') Gaghan never gives the prosecution much of a case. Spineless villains, shoddy scripting, and uninspired directing demote this epic. Compared with top-notch military courtroom dramas, such as 'Breaker Morant,' 'Courage Under Fire,' and 'Paths of Glory,' (and even lesser ones like 'A Few Good Men'), 'Rules' qualifies as drab fatigue duty.This 'from the combat to courtroom' flashback-rippled G.I. issue saga opens in Vietnam in 1968 with Lt. Hayes Hodges and Childers on patrol when all hell breaks loose. North Vietnamese troops ambush Hodges' men and wipe them out. Meanwhile, Childers and his platoon capture the enemy radio operator and compel the commander at gunpoint to send the NVA packing. Childers shoots an unarmed enemy soldier in cold blood to show his resolve. The enemy officer relents and gives the order. Hodges owes Childers his life.In 1996, when the U.S. Embassy in Yemen comes under fire, the Pentagon sends in Childers and the Marines. What might have begun as a protest has escalated into a siege when the three choppers ferrying Childers and company arrive. Gunners on nearby balconies are firing into the embassy. Interspersed in the crowd are people with guns blazing away indiscriminately at the building. (Jingoistic as this movie is, all of the Muslims are naturally stereotypes.)The Marines storm the grounds under a hail of gunfire. Childers rescues a cowardly ambassador (Ben Kingsley of 'Species') cowering under his desk and escort him, his wife (Anne Archer in a tight-lipped performance), and son to safety. Eventually, the wild-eyed, unshaven Arab gunners stop missing and start hitting the Marines. Reeling from a near-miss bullet, Childers gives the order to mow down those mothers ! The Marines stand up and unleash a withering barrage of gunfire. Nothing moves afterward and everything is quiet. Eighty-three people die while another 100 are wounded. Predictably, the Yemen government denounces the shooting as an international incident. A despicable National Security Adviser Bill Sokal (Bruce Greenwood, Ashley Judd's reptilian husband in 'Double Jeopardy) destroys the only evidence that would indisputably exonerate Childers and brings in a martinet prosecutor ('L.A. Confidential's' Guy Pearce with a pugnacious five o'clock shadow) to hang Childers from the yard arm.Meanwhile, Hodges gets flak from his father and son about defending Childers, but he sticks with his friend and sees him through to the end. The happy ending is never in doubt in Stephen Gaghan's screenplay. When he isn't polishing The Hodges character is sketchy and all we have to go on is Jones interpretation. Basically, Tommy Lee is playing a guy who is going to fall apart at any minute. Hodges wins the case but not because he is a good lawyer, instead because 'Rules' is such a feeble-minded melodrama. Added to all this is the low-key non-ending that wraps up the action.Gone are the days for William Friedkin. He once made solid, exciting movies with a pulse. 'The Exorcist,' 'The French Connection,' 'To Live & Die in L.A.' and 'Sorcerer' rank as his best. Friedkin hacks his way through a jungle of nonsense in 'Rules.' The Vietnam firefight has none of 'Saving Private Ryan's' riveting violence, while the embassy attack resembles a bad TV thriller where the body count must be low. The only thing remotely original about 'Rules' is the way that the courtroom has been designed so that more actors can be seen in the same shot.As always, Samuel L. Jackson is first-rate. This jar-headed thriller doesn't deserve his charisma. Since Jackson originated his angry black man routine in 'Pulp Fiction,' he has become the African-American version of Christopher Walken. He wears the role well, and you're convinced that he could put a cap into you. Jackson is a live wire, and he energizes 'Rules' with his wattage. His performance blinds you to the flaws in his character and the script. If the Marine Corp is looking for a few good recruits, 'Rules of Engagement' may scare them off.",2,5,9,9 July 2007
Kelly's Heroes," Monumental World War II Movie
","Director Brian Hutton followed up his smash hit World War II espionage thriller 'Where Eagles Dare' with 'Kelly's Heroes.' Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton masqueraded as Germans to infiltrate an impregnable castle and rescue a prisoner who knew everything about D-Day. Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland and Eastwood behave like renegades who plan to loot a heavily guarded bank behind enemy lines. 'The Italian Job' scenarist Troy Martin Kennedy pulls off a spectacular premise that had never been done before when he combined a World War II movie with an impossible heist thriller. A platoon of restless G.I.s who are left to their own designs storm enemy lines to rob a bank. Since command has pulled them out of battle and ordered them to take rest and relaxation, they decide to grab something for themselves. Clint Eastwood plays Kelly, a former U.S. Army lieutenant demoted because somebody had to assume blame for a botched mission that claimed the lives of all his men. Kelly captures a German officer,Colonel Dankhopf, and interrogates him with liquor to loosen his tongue. Our hero discovers an ingot of gold that looks like a lead bar in the Colonel's brief case. Initially, Dankhopf tries to persuade Kelly that the bar is really made out of lead so it could sink the satchel in water. As Sgt. Big Joe, Telly Savalas co-stars as an abusive but skeptical non-com, while a woolly Donald Sutherland steals the show as a stoner tank commander. Eastwood and company set out for a $16 million pay day and wind up turning the tide of battle with their exploits. Confronted by angry Germans prepared to kill them, our heroes find themselves being pursued by a crazy General (Carol O'Connor) dying to hand out medals for gallantry. The finale in an occupied town is played as if it were a World War II version of 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is inspirational. 'Kelly's Heroes' boasts ingenuity, suspense, tension, and humor. The scene where Oddball's tankers destroy a railway shipping center to the tune of 'I've Been Working on the Railroad' is really amusing. 'Kelly's Heroes' is a must-see for all combat movie fanatics.",9,3,4,25 May 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Lurid but Gripping Mystery Thriller
","This lurid but engrossing mystery thriller about a cold-blooded killer who kills women for fun is riveting stuff from start to finish. Danish director Niels Arden Oplev helmed the first of the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson's 'Millennium' trilogy of thrillers. Clocking in at 153 minutes, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a gripping account of the search for a girl who mysteriously vanished and one of her relatives who hires a journalist who has just lost a libel suit against a billionaire industrialist to find her. Retired industrialist Henrik Vanger hires publisher of the Swedish political magazine Millennium, Mikael Blomkvist, to solve the 40 year disappearance of Henrik's great-niece. Henrik puts Blomkvist on this cold case based on a profile prepared for him by Lisbeth Salander, a computer whiz with a history of having been abused by her father. In flashbacks, we learn that Lisbeth set her abusive father aflame and she has been on probation since the incident. When she starts hacking into Blomkvist's computer to solve the mystery herself, the journalist contacts her and she joins him. Lisbeth knows a whole lot about abuse. Not only did her father take advantage of her, but she finds herself raped and sodomized by her new probation officer. Lisbeth turns the tables on the evil man when he ties her down to a bed and has his way with her. Little does he know that she has recorded a video of him ravishing her. Later, she gains the upper hand, ties him up, and tattoos on his stomach the words 'I am a sadistic pig and a rapist' on his stomach. Eventually, as Blomkvist's investigation takes him dangerously close to the truth, the rest of the Vanger family objects, particularly after Henrik suffers a heart attack. Oplev doesn't waste a single second and you cannot take your eyes off Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is an unforgettable film.",10,3,4,20 December 2011
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," 'Apocalypse' will reanimate anybody who enjoyed 'Resident Evil'
","The biggest problem with some movie sequels is that you need to know what happened in the original to appreciate what occurs in the sequel. Fortunately, ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse ' (*** out of ****) recaps 'Resident Evil' during its first few minutes, creates an even bigger crisis for another motley crew of characters, then this exciting video-game inspired sequel resumes where the original left off and goes for the jugular. In other words, if you missed 'Resident Evil' or don't recall it well enough to fill-in-the-blanks, the filmmakers do it for you, bringing you up to speed for the sequel. Happily, L'Oreal international spokesmodel Milla Jovovitch reprises her athletic, gun-toting, butt-kicking role as Alice, ex-head of security at The Hive, while scenarist Paul W.S. Anderson provides some additional surprises for audiences since they last saw Alice. Brighter, bloodier, and more hyperkinetic than 'Resident Evil,' 'Apocalypse' pulls out all stops with spectacular, high-octane combat, eye-catching photography, and charismatic characters. Although he falls back on the oldest plot in the apocalyptic genre: the rescue story (anybody remember 'Escape From New York' or 'Raiders of Atlantis?'), Anderson conjures up a new group of take-charge heroes that you don't often find in these bone-numbing, written-by-the-numbers, chiller thrillers. Meaning, a larger number of good guys survive 'Apocalypse' than their ill-fated counterparts in 'Resident Evil.' Whereas 'Resident Evil' took place underground in the top-secret Hive Viral Research Facility, 'Apocalypse' transpires above-earth in the city around normal, everyday, urban surroundings where the scares get scarier. For example, after the contagious T-Virus infects the city, a Catholic priest struggles to save a zombified woman by roping her down to a chair and feeding her the human body parts of less fortunate victims. Veteran second-unit action director Alexander Witt, who cut his teeth helming big-scale action sequences for 'Black Hawk Down,' 'Gladiator,' 'XXX,' 'Daredevil,' and 'Speed,' takes over for 'Resident Evil' director Paul W.S. Anderson. Anderson departed for the opportunity to call the shots on the new 'Alien Vs. Predator' sequel. As the first 'Evil' epic did, 'Apocalypse' indicts corporations who imagine themselves exempt from the rules that govern society.As the action unfolds, Raccoon City--which sprawls above the Umbrella Corporation's underground testing facility the Hive--has been infected by a T-Virus that kills people then transforms them into flesh-feasting zombies. Scene for scene, 'Apocalypse' surpasses the original. The mutant Dobermans pinchers in 'Apocalypse' put those pups in 'Resident' to shame. The only drawback is the Umbrella Corporation's newest monster, the towering Nemesis figure who resembles Chewbacca, the 'Star Wars' wookie but with a severe case of the mange. Once the T-Virus spreads throughout the city, everybody panics and wants out. Umbrella officials with corporate armed security guards block all exits and prepare to nuke the city. Not only do they want to cover-up their debacle, but also they want to eliminate any witnesses. Caught on the wrong side of the wall are supercop Jill Valentine (sexy British actress Sienna Guillory of 'The Time Machine') who wears a tube-top and a miniskirt and can out-shoot the Lone Ranger; Umbrella policemen Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehur of 'The Mummy'); and smart-aleck African-American street hustler L.J. (Mike Epps of 'Next Friday'). A wheelchair-bound Umbrella Corp. scientist Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris of 'Happiness') who lost his junior high school aged daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur of 'Evelyn'), during the evacuation, tracks down Alice and company. If they find his daughter, the good doctor will direct them to safety.Unlike 'Resident Evil,' 'Apocalypse' isn't all about the reanimated corpses. Again, scenarist Anderson furnishes more revelations about the contagious T-Virus, while he lets the heroes get away with the darnest things. The mile-a-minute action sequences will spin your head, and watching Jill and Alice blast away with their mega-weapons at hordes of these evildoers really ramps up the adrenaline factor. Of course, it's as far-fetched as flying rabbits, but wow how those rabbits do fly! Witt makes an impressive directorial debut, orchestrating elaborate action scenes with occasionally jolting blood & gore. 'Apocalypse' will reanimate anybody who enjoyed 'Resident Evil.'",8,0,1,21 June 2007
Dumb and Dumber," The Farce Is With Lloyd & Harry
","As the Farrelly Brothers' freshman foray into lowest common denominator comedy, 'Dumb and Dumber' lives up to its dim-witted title. The humor is strictly of the adolescent, simple-minded, scatological variety, with pratfalls galore. Nevertheless, you'll your sphincter will dilate because you'll laugh so hard at this farcical inanity that you'll have a bowel movement. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels topline as the eponymous morons on a road-trip from Rhode Island to Colorado to deliver an abandoned attaché case crammed with loot that cute heroine Lauren Holly left deliberately behind at the airport on her way to Aspen. When goofy limo driver Carrey does a good deed by latching onto the luggage that the girl of his dreams tried to hand off inconspicuously at the airport terminal, hi-jinks ensue with our harebrained heroes struggling to get the luggage back to her. What our clueless cretins don't comprehend is that she deliberately abandoned the luggage stuffed with $100-thousand dollars to ransom her abducted husband. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey of the 'Ace Ventura' movies) drives a limbo at the outset out and doesn't know the difference between a babe from Austria, much less Australia, and surmises that she is from New Jersey. This woebegone wiseacre is pals with a dog groomer who has converted his ride into the biggest sight gag in the movie. Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels of 'Gettysburg') shares the same dream with Lloyd about embarking as entrepreneurs in the business of worm farming. 'I've got worms,' Lloyd gleefully informs his horrified limo customer, Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), about his aspirations. Meantime, two thoroughly reprehensible thugs trail them across country. Joe Mentalino (Mike Starr of 'Clockers') and J.P. Shay (Karen Duffy of 'Reality Bites') are the ruffians in pursuit. Joe suffers from an ulcer, and he lacks a shred of sympathy. After Shay and he break into Harry's apartment to retrieve the valise, Joe twists the head off Harry's pet parakeet Petey. Nevertheless, our heroes manage to eliminate them without realizing the hellacious trouble that they are in. Joe decides to masquerade as a man whose car has broken down on the highway so he can hitch a ride with them. He goes more than he bargained for in the process. The scene at restaurant later on concludes with his demise as the consequence of a prank that Lloyd and Harry play on him. The sight gags are terrific, especially the headlights and Harry's mutt truck, with Carrey and Daniels doing their best 'two stooges' act, and the Farrellys doling out irreverent as well as uneven politically-incorrect humor. The scene when Harry urinates on Lloyd while they are cruising up to Aspen in freezing weather is amusing because like everything else in 'Dumb and Dumber' is about incongruity. Our heroes make Forrest Gump look like Albert Einstein. The prequel that followed not long afterward was amusing but it flopped. A belated but side-splitting sequel surfaced 20 years later, with Carrey and Daniels reprising their roles respectively as Lloyd and Harry. The labored gag when Lloyd has to relieved himself with nowhere else to go than a collection of beer bottles and a cop stops them and decides to sample one of their open container is funny, too. To their credit neither actor behave like everything that they are doing is amusing, and Carrey took the cap off one of his front teeth for comic effect. Mind you, this isn't the Farrelly Brothers' best work, but you can see the seeds of their future.",8,1,2,14 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians 2 Is As Good As Guardians 1
","'Super' writer & director James Gunn took moviegoers for an irreverent, interplanetary joyride, peppered with pop culture references, in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' back in 2014. Happily, Gunn's sequel 'Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2' qualifies as just as impressive with several surprises. If you haven't seen 'GoTG, Vol. 1,' then you may have problems putting both the swashbuckling characters and their outlandish backstory into context in this imaginative, science-fiction, follow-up saga. Good sequels always dig deeper into the original characters and conjure up newcomers. 'GoTG, Vol. 2' reassembles the same quintet and scrutinizes them in greater detail. Peter Quill, ostensibly the Guardians' leader, catches up with his enigmatic sire, Ego, and father and son surprise each other with their goals during the second act. We learn that Ego has been searching the universe for his long, lost son. Later, Yondu observes astutely about the grandiose Ego: 'He may have been your father, Quill, but he wasn't your daddy.' This father and son connection yields the ultimate surprise, too, but discretion prevents me from divulging specifics. The peculiar relationship that Quill has forged with Yondu Udonta, the extraterrestrial space pirate who abducted Quill from Earth after the lad fled from the hospital where his cancer-stricken mom died takes on an added dimension. No character changes as much in 'GoTG 2' as Yondu. He evolves from a villain to an honorable individual. Meanwhile, sibling rivalry keeps Quill's quasi-girlfriend Gamora locked into a feud with her jealous sister Nebula. Nebula hates Gamora with a passion because their evil stepfather Thanos preferred Gamora over her. Smutty-mouthed Rocket Raccoon remains as obnoxious as ever, but his bad-tempered attitude thaws during the third act. Good sequels send off the characters onto exciting new adventures against different villains. The Guardians are summoned to a remote corner of the cosmos again. The new aliens—the Sovereigns—constitute a petulant people with little sense of humor. When Rocket infuriates them, the latter pursue the Guardians with a vengeance until greater powers interfere.The last time we saw the Guardians, the Nova Corps had cleared them of all crimes and provided them with a refurnished version of his spaceship 'The Milano.' The arboreal, sentient-like, extraterrestrial Groot (Vin Diesel's voice) had sacrificed himself to save his companions, but Rocket Raccoon scourged up a surviving twig and has planted it. As 'GoTG, Vol. 2,' unfolds, an arrogant race of gilded humanoids known as the Sovereigns have employed our motley crew to protect their priceless batteries from an enormous but absurd-looking trout with thrashing tentacles and thousands of thorny teeth. During the hilarious opening credits gambit, the roguish Star-Lord (Chris Pratt of 'The Magnificent Seven'), green-skinned Amazon Gamora (Zoe Saldana of 'Colombiana'), blue-skinned hulk Drax (Dave Bautista of 'Spectre'), and pugnacious Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper's voice) tangle with this cartoonish thing atop a platform where the batteries are housed that resembles an electric razor. During this far-fetched fracas, Baby Groot dances to Star-Lord's mix tape oblivious to any peril the fire-breathing trout-squid poses while the Guardians struggle to slay their nemesis. The scene is clever because Gunn choreographs this blockbuster action with Baby Groot in the foreground rather than the contentious Guardians! Afterward, the grateful Sovereigns reward our heroes with nothing less than Gamora's deceitful sister Nebula! No sooner have our heroes proved their nerve to the Sovereigns than they find themselves in trouble with them. The contemptuous Rocket has taken it upon himself to steal some of those valuable batteries. The incensed Sovereigns deployed a drone fleet to annihilate the Guardians. Conveniently, Peter Quill's biological father Ego (Kurt Russell of 'The Hateful 8') intervenes and saves them from the Sovereigns. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to accompany him to his planet, while Rocket, Baby Groot, and Nebula stay behind to repair their crashed spacecraft.Meantime, the haughty Sovereign High Priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki of 'The Great Gatsby') hires arrow-whistling Ravager chieftain Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker of 'The Belk Experiment') to track down the Guardians. What Yondu doesn't know is a perfidious faction within his gang of smugglers has been plotting mutiny. Yondu's grotesque lieutenant, Taserface (Chris Sullivan of 'Imperium'), sparks this uprising. After they catch up with Rocket, Baby Groot, and Nebula, the mutinous Ravagers turn on Yondu and lock him up with Rocket. Nevertheless, Yondu and Rocket aren't idle behind bars for long because Baby Groot helps them to escape. Mind you, Yondu was already up to his ears in trouble with the rest of the Ravagers and their commander, Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone of 'Rocky'), who turned against him for kidnapping Peter Quill in the first place. If you saw the original 'G0TG,' you know Star-Lord tricked Yondu when he relinquished the Orb. The wily Star-Lord replaced the Infinity Stone that had been in the Orb with a grinning troll doll. Yondu had payback in mind when he sold his services to the Sovereigns, but then everything went sideways for him. Nevertheless, once Rocket, Baby Groot, and he escape, Yondu eliminates their adversaries with his whistling arrow.The major revelation of the 'Guardians' sequel concerns the character of Ego. Kurt Russel looks like he had a blast playing this murderous Celestial being who is essentially a manifestation of a psychedelic planet that Ego created for himself. Basically, he is a selfish amoral deity who behaves like the Greek god Zeus. During their brief stint on the planet, Peter and Ego begin on friendly terms until Ego slips up and reveals something appalling that alienates Peter. With its sumptuous CGI of alien galaxies and landscapes, 'GoTG, Vol. 2' looks a hundred times better visually than its predecessor. If you enjoyed the greatest hits music in the original film, the sequel serves up even more memorable pop tunes and incorporates them into the psychology of the plot, too! As the fifteenth entry in the Marvel Comics Cinematic Universe, the tongue-in-cheek 'Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2' ranks as one of the best.",10,2,4,5 June 2017
Evil Dead," Graphic But Not As Great As The Original 'Evil Dead'
","The harrowing imagery alone makes the 'Evil Dead' remake worth the price of admission. 'Spider-Man' helmer Sam Raimi directed the original 'Evil Dead' back in 1981. He swirled horror with humor in a low-budget scream-fest with a no-name cast. Despite its crappy special effects, this supernatural splatter-spoof ranks as a cult favorite among gorehounds. Raimi went on to direct two sequels, and Bruce Campbell attained the status of B-movie hero. The skewered cinematography, atmospheric settings, and maniacal urgency made this contrived 85 minute nonsense unforgettable. Comparatively, in his directorial debut, writer & director Fede Alvarez, abetted by co-scenarists Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody, has preserved the premise of the Raimi classic. Nevertheless, he has shunned Raimi's ghoulish but campy approach. Moreover, the Uruguayan native has ramped up the gore far more than Raimi dared. In fact, Alvarez has knocked the bottom out with some elaborately orchestrated carnage that makes the 'Saw' movies look tame. One scene depicts a girl mutilating her arm with an electric carving knife. The MPAA must have felt in a charitable mood when they gave 'Evil Dead' an R-rating 'for strong bloody violence and gore, some sexual content and language.' The visual CGI effects are designed to make you regurgitate. Make no mistake; Alvarez has conjured up one hellacious nightmare of a movie. One of the girls acts as if she were auditioning for 'The Ring' (1998) rather than 'The Evil Dead.' She crawls around on her hands with her hair in her eyes and blood and gore all over her body. Indeed, the isolated cabin-in-the-woods plot provides an excuse for ample mutilation, rampant dismemberment, and buckets of blood. Unlike the original, Alvarez's 'Evil Dead' doesn't duplicate the bucolic rape of one of the girls. Alvarez doesn't plunge the bole of a tree between her thighs as Raimi did in the original. Instead, Alvarez has a sinister witch cough up a skein of black licorice that crawls up and into the struggling girl's mouth.In the 1981 original 'Evil Dead,' five Michigan State college students cruised up to a ramshackle cabin in the middle of nowhere to enjoy Spring Break. They discover a tape recording and a book fashioned from human flesh in the basement. One of them recites passages aloud from the forbidden text. The combination of the Book of the Dead being opened and its incantations being uttered summons evil. Predictably, all Hell breaks loose. The big change in the remake is Alvarez provides an incendiary prologue. Two men manhandle a girl into a basement and lash her to a post. The girl's father incinerates her while a crone mutters incantations from the same Book of the Dead. As an opening gambit, this torture scene prepares us for the pandemonium that ensues. Level-headed college students made up the original 'Evil Dead' group. The remake deploys a group of friends rehabilitating one of their own. Mia (Jane Levy of 'Fun Size') has a monkey on her back in the form of heroin. After spending several years apart from each other, she is reunited with her older brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez of 'Red'), who knows nothing about her addiction. The two share some bad memories. Namely, David left Mia to contend with their dying, mentally distraught mom. Not only is Mia a heroin junkie, but also this isn't the first time she has tried to conquer her craving. As Olivia (Jessica Lucas of 'Clovefield') informs David, she and her friends don't intend to let Mia bail out of the treatment. For the record, David is the vague equivalent of Ash (Bruce Campbell) from the original. Alvarez has given all the characters different names. This time around, Olivia and company plan to keep Mia isolated in the woods while she endures a cold-turkey withdrawal. No sooner has this been said and done than Olivia's bespectacled boyfriend, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci of 'Fanboys'), finds the Book of the Dead, made from human flesh, scrawled in blood, and bound by barbed wire. Foolishly, Eric reads aloud from this tome. Meantime, Mia stumbles outside into the woods. Suddenly, vines, branches, and roots trap poor Mia in the underbrush and hold her captive for an evil witch. This lesbian witch spews profanity from her vile, wretched lips, and a licorice like skein of black sludge slithers up into Mia's mouth. At this point, 'Evil Dead' leaves mild behind and turns heavy-duty.Alvarez wallows his cast in blood, gore, and more. You know when you see a battery powered nail gun that somebody is going to use it on somebody else. Before things get really gory, a poor old pooch is slaughtered, but canine's death is staged off-screen. Everybody suffers horribly in 'Evil Dead,' and nobody truly escapes without either sacrificing a body part or donating enough blood to revive a corpse. The most iconic scene in this savage saga occurs near the end. A one-armed, demon-possessed character gives another demon- possessed character a lobotomy courtesy of a chainsaw through the mouth. Essentially, 'Evil Dead' lives up to its title with oodles of evil and death. Further, Alvarez takes his subject matter seriously enough that you could suffer nightmares from his over-the-top depiction of malevolence. Of course, we don't give a hoot who gets what in the end. The characters qualify as one-dimensional victims. 'Evil Dead' spends most of its time trying to gross us out with its graphic detail. If you're squeamish, you should shun this remake with its bad night in the emergency room blood and gore. As remakes go, 'Evil Dead' tops the original in terms of its polished production values, but its authentic looking gore doesn't surpass its predecessor's sense of humor. While the characters have more to occupy themselves with in the remake, nobody generates the charisma that Bruce Campbell did the original. Incidentally, if you sit through the end credits, you will see Bruce make a cameo.",8,14,57,5 April 2013
The Evil Dead," A Cheapie Creepy Classic!!!
","Miraculously enough, Sam Raimi and his long-time friend Bruce Campbell struck pay dirt with their first feature-length film. A low-budget but ghoulish horror movie, 'The Evil Dead' takes place in the Tennessee hills where five college students are heading off for Spring Break. This quintet hole up in a dilapidated cabin and discover a tape recording along with an ancient but enigmatic Sumerian tome. Before long they find themselves surrounded by demon-possessed fauna and experience evil first hand. The reel-to-reel tape recording that they uncover contains comments from an archaeologist about his research and his experience with demons. The 'Naturon Demonto' stands for the Sumerian Book of the Dead. The unwitting students unleash the demons when they utter some incantations. Those dreadful creatures come after them with a vengeance. Cheryl thinks she hears something outside and ventures out into the dark. The woods rise up against her and vines pin her spread-eagled to the ground while a tree thrusts its bole itself into her. This has got to qualify as the most outlandish rape in cinematic history. Things wax progressively worst, and Cheryl's brother Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to lock her up in the basement. Indeed, he has to festoon the trapdoor with chains. Nevertheless, Cheryl can raise it far enough to look at the occupants in the room. Eventually, all the females become demon possessed, and the guys really have their hands full as they defend themselves. This 85 minute horror epic swirls horror with humor. Happily, Raimi doesn't take himself seriously, and 'The Evil Dead' is a black comedy of sorts. The success of this chiller spawned two sequels, 'Evil Dead II' (1987) and 'Army of Darkness' (1992). One of the eeriest of shots occurs when we share the perspective of evil and are flying through the woods. Reportedly, Raimi achieved this steady-cam effect by mounting his camera on a 2x4 and running through the woods with Bruce Campbell on the other end. What makes this movie so memorable is the spirit that Raimi infuses the film with, its skewered cinematography, the breakneck pace, and its humor. The 2013 remake changed the names of the characters and alters several events.",10,1,3,7 April 2013
Shrek 2," 'Shrek 2' reminds us that only real ogres have curves!
","The new animated DreamsWorks' movie 'Shrek 2' (** out of ****) recaptures only half the magic of its peerless, four-star, ground-breaking predecessor. Although the amusing animation by Pacific Data Images (PDI) lives up to--if not surpasses--the original 'Shrek,' the humdrum 'meet the in-laws' plot recycles the shape-shifting shenanigans of the original but reverses who's afflicted without providing enough fresh humor or hysterically hair-raising heroics. This time around, our gallant but anti-social green ogre suffers the slings and arrows of outrageous skullduggery. In 'Shrek,' Princess Fiona shape shifted from beauty to the beast between sunset and sun-up. In 'Shrek 2,' Shrek himself shifts shapes from a monstrous lime-green ogre to a broad-shouldered hunkster who resembles a buffed-up Freddie Prinze Jr. with tousled forelocks fashionably awry above his affable eyes and his massive, virile jaw. Unlike the original, the comic tomfoolery in this contrived, uninspired sequel more often than not misses the funny bone, and the protagonists --Shrek and Fiona--appear curiously anemic. Basically, Shrek delivers little of the charisma that made his character so endearing and sympathetic in the first film. Meanwhile, several new comic characters show up in 'Shrek 2,' such as the overconfident Puss-In-Boots and the garrulous Fairy Godmother, but they clutter up the plot and serve more to pad out its lackluster, 93-minute running time. 'Shrek 2' consists of more flat scenes than funny ones, while its narrative revelations pale beside the original. Whereas the first 'Shrek' ridiculed the 'happily-ever-after ,' 'knight-in-shining armor,' 'save the damsel-in-distress' plot, the predictably sappy sequel gives action the short shrift and approaches its subject like a gabby soap opera. At the same time, Donkey gets the one-and-only best line in 'Shrek 2' when he advises the ogre to give Puss-In-Boots 'the Bob Barker treatment.' Sadly, not even Donkey's clowning around enlivens 'Shrek 2,' because the writers have diluted Donkey's character so that their underwritten sword-wielding cat can claim screen time. Nevertheless, these obvious shortcomings won't bother the kids in the audience, but adults may find themselves struggling to smile at the obvious jokes and the second-rate gags. Savvy, movie-going grown-ups will savor the many ultra-cutesy but disposable cinematic sight-gag references to other films, such as 'Spider-man,' 'From Here To Eternity,' and 'The Lord of the Rings,' though these add little to the plot and stand out more as mind-tickling trivia.The original 'Shrek' faded out with Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz of 'Charlie's Angels') and Shrek (voice of Michael Myers of 'Austin Powers') living happily ever after in his swamp with Donkey (voice of 'Beverly Hills Cop' Eddie Murphy) as their unwanted neighbor intruding on them at the worst possible moments. Inevitably, Fiona's parents--Queen Lillian (voice of Julie Andrews of 'The Sound of Music') and King Harold (voice of John Cleese of 'Die Another Day')--invite our ogreish couple to their castle in the kingdom of Far Far Away Land. Shrek dreads meeting the parents. He fears Fiona's father won't approve of him. Can we say miscegenation? At the same time, Fiona's meddlesome Fairy Godmother (voice of Jennifer Saunders from the 'Absolutely Fabulous' TV series) wants her worthless Prince Charming son (voice of Rupert Everett from 'My Best Friend's Wedding') , originally betrothed to Fiona, to win her heart after Fiona breaks up with Shrek. Meanwhile, conniving King Harold pays a swashbuckling feline assassin, Puss-In-Boots (voice of Antonio Banderas of 'The Mask of Zorro'), to eliminate our hero. Later, the scheming Fairy Godmother gives Shrek and Donkey a potion that transforms them into a super hunk and his snorting stallion respectively, while Fiona falls victim to a spell that makes her vulnerable to the first fellow she kisses. Prince Charming sets out to make his conquest during a dance while Shrek struggles to find Fiona. Puss- In-Boots changes sides after he fails to skewer Shrek, and nearly all the original fairy tale characters come to Shrek's aid, especially the giant Gingerbread Man who storms the castle until he is drenched in milk .Originally, DreamWorks made no plans to produce a sequel, until 'Shrek' coined over $482 plus million both domestically and overseas. Since 'Shrek 2' has sold $353-plus million dollars worth of tickets, you can expect a second sequel. Hopefully, the second sequel will fare better than this first sequel. 'Rugrats' scenarist J. David Stern along with original 'Shrek' scribes Joe Stillman and David N. Weiss have penned an old-fashioned, off-centered fairy tale yarn that just simply isn't as side-splitting as the first 'Shrek.' Mind you, some of the satiric product placement witticisms will amuse you, with derivative products such as Burger Prince (Burger King), Olde Knavery (Old Navy), Saxon Fifth Avenue (Saks Fifth Avenue), Romeo Drive (Rodeo Drive), Versarchery (Versace), Gap Queen (Gap Kids), Farbucks Coffee (Starbucks), and Tower of London Records (Tower Records). That is part of 'Shrek 2's' problem, its background and popular movie references are more funny than its half-baked, hackneyed plot. Ironically, 'Shrek 2' comes at a time when Americans are being chided about the dangers of obesity. As ogres, Shrek and Fiona both are plug-ugly and obese. Interestingly, when they change shapes and emerge as attractive, they sacrifice what little personality that their physical afflictions gave them. I loved the original 'Shrek,' and I watched again it before I saw 'Shrek 2.' Anybody who says 'Shrek 2' tops 'Shrek' must have seen an altogether different movie. In the end, however, 'Shrek 2' reminds us that only real ogres have curves!",3,0,0,21 June 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Carnage a la Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino's blood-soaked revenge thriller 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' differs from anything the 'Pulp Fiction' director has ever attempted. Unlike his previous crime movies, 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' doesn't flaunt his distinctive way with dialogue and the characters are nothing like those in 'Reservoir Dogs,' 'Pulp Fiction,' and 'Jackie Brown.' Tarantino still uses titles to establish locations and he divides this narrative up into several chapters. Although he plots the gritty action out of chronological order, this movie isn't as fractured as his earlier films. Furthermore, 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' isn't as referential as his earlier work. Indeed, the characters don't mention other movies. Nevertheless, 'Kill Bill' contains other kinds of reference. Spaghetti western aficionados will recognize his use of musical selections from two Lee Van Cleef horse operas, Luis Bacalov's 'Grand Duel' and Ennio Morricone's 'Death Rides a Horse.' One character whistles the 'Twisted Nerve' tune that Alfred Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrman wrote as well as Quincy Jones' 'Ironside' theme. The closest that Tarantino comes to visual cinematic allusions is the yellow outfit the Uma Thurman wears; this is a reference to Bruce Lee. Celebrated Asian stars Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu have cameos. Michael Parks, one of the most underrated of all Hollywood actors, reprises his role as Texas lawman Earl McGraw that he originated in 'From Dusk Till Dawn.'The first half of this two volume film set features tall, slender Uma Thurman looking for the evil dastards that crashed her El Paso wedding ceremony and butchered nine people, including her husband. Our pregnant heroine was left for dead on the floor at the scene of this blood splattered massacre. Miraculously, The Bride survived this slaughter, spent four years in a coma, and only through the intervention of the man who very nearly killed her, the eponymous Bill, wasn't killed as she lay in her bed when one-eyed assassin Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah of 'Splash') visits her. The recovery scene in Coma Ward RM 402 of the hospital is similar to but not as suspenseful as a similar scene in the Steven Seagal thriller 'Hard to Kill.' The first volume follows The Bride (Uma Thurman of 'Batman & Robin') as she searches for those homicidal maniacs who changed her life forever. She confronts the first in California and has it out with her, Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox of 'Independence Day'), until Vernita's daughter arrives home from school. The two women call a truce just long enough for Vernita to try and shoot her through a cereal box with KaBoom on it. Afterward, The Bride flies to Okinawa where she meets Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba of 'The Streetfighter') and persuades him to forge her samurai sword like no other to take on O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui) and her army of swordsmen. Reluctantly, Hattori fashions a sword for her, the first sword that he has made since he took a vow 28 years earlier to stop making swords. Part of the reason is that The Bride tells him that he is responsible in part for what has happened to her. Silently, Hattori uses his finger as a pen and scrawls the name Bill on a window pane. He takes a month to create an entirely new sword from scratch.Basically, 'Kill Bill' is a duel between The Bride and O-Ren. Tarantino stages some impressive battle sequences, specifically the non-stop fight in a restaurant between The Bride and O-Ren's army of Yakuza killers. You've got to have a strong stomach to handle the gory action as well as some of the unsavory characters, principally a hospital nurse named Buck who allows his friends to have their way with the unconscious Bride until a mosquito awakens her from her coma. Tarantino doesn't something else that he has never done. He has our heroine narrate the rise of O-Ren in the Japanese underworld and depicts her emergence as one of the top Tokyo criminals in anime. 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' concludes on a surprising note.",8,0,3,6 June 2012
Clash of the Titans," A Remake That Surpasses The Original!!!
","Cherish your fond memories of the cult film favorite 'Clash of the Titans' (1981) with Harry Hamlin, because 'Incredible Hulk' director Louis Leterrier's remake twists virtually everything inside out. The superior remake eliminates some characters, replaces them with others, and alters the line-up of scenes. Indeed, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 'Clash of the Titans' revised the Greek myth of Perseus, but the Warner Brothers redux gives the legend a heavy-duty overhaul. Scenarist Travis Beacham along with 'Æon Flux' co-scripters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi have taken even more liberties with Greek mythology than Beverley Cross dared in the original. Comparatively, Leterrier and his scribes have surpassed the original simply because special effects technology has come so far since stop-motion guru Ray Harryhausen dazzled audiences with the 1981 version. Leterrier assembles gargoyles, gigantic back-hoe sized scorpions, a reptilian Medusa with writhing vipers for locks and a gaze that turns men into statues, and a humongous sea monster that resembles the adversary in Leterrier's 'Incredible Hulk' sequel. Unlike the tongue-in-cheek, juvenile-oriented original, the 'Clash of the Titans' remake takes itself pretty seriously and its solemn, larger-than-life shenanigans boast a brawny, believable look. Gone is the toy mechanical owl from the original, but the remake acknowledges Bubo the Owl before it consigns it to oblivion. The chief error that Warner Brothers made with this $126-million remake is they converted it from 2-D to 3-D. No 'Clash of the Titans' was not lensed in 3-D. Indeed, some shots display some extraordinary depth from the foreground to the background. Nevertheless, you will miss nothing if you watch 'Clash of the Titans' without your glasses. The edges around some characters and objects may appear fuzzy, but not as fuzzy as usual. The dead giveaway that the action was not photographed in 3-D is the absence of anything being hurled at you throughout this 106-minute melodrama.'Terminator: Salvation' and 'Avatar' star Sam Worthington plays the heroic Perseus as a sort of conscientious objector. As the film opens, the infant Perseus and his dead mother Danaë bubble up from the depths of the ocean in a wooden casket. An ordinary fisherman, Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite of 'The Usual Suspects'), saves Perseus. He raises the lad as his own flesh and blood. Perseus knows he is an orphan, but Spyros loves him. Otherwise, Perseus knows nothing else about himself. In the original 'Clash of the Titans,' King Acrisius of Argos condemned Perseus and his mother Danaë to death and set them adrift in a coffin. Acrisius feared a prophecy that stipulated his death if his daughter bore a child. In this version, Zeus impregnates King Acrisius' wife and Acrisius sets them adrift. Perseus grows up and witnesses greater momentous events. Zeus (Liam Neeson of 'Taken') created mankind so that human prayers would fuel the immortality of the deities. Unfortunately, mankind has grown weary of the Greek gods atop Mount Olympus, and King of Argos demolishes a towering statue of Zeus. After the monument falls into the sea, the God of the Underworld, Hades (Ralph Fiennes of 'The English Patient'), unleashes gargoyles and even puts in an appearance, too. Hades creates a disturbance that sinks Spyros' ship, sending it to the bottom and drowning his entire family. Perseus survives this debacle and swears vengeance against Hades.In the palace of Argos, Hades reappears, wipes out the palace guard, and informs King that Perseus is a demigod. Furthermore, as punishment for their blasphemous behavior, Hades plans to turn the Kraken loose on Argos and destroy the city in 10 days unless the King sacrifices his beautiful daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos of 'Defiance'), who is willing to die for the populace. Hades is angry because Zeus tricked him into presiding over the underworld. At one point, Zeus ordered Hades to create a monster that would destroy the Titans, the ancestors of Zeus and company, and Hades created the Kraken. Mind you, the Kraken is a creature from Scandinavian, not Greek mythology. As the son of Zeus, Perseus feels greater contempt for the gods and wants nothing to do with his hallowed father. The King of Argos persuades Perseus to lead an expedition to consult the Stygian Witches about the power of the Kraken. The Stygian Witches—blind hags with a single eye between them--explain that only the Medusa can destroy the Kraken. The Medusa, however, doesn't make house calls. We learn about the Medusa's origins and how she was punished for having sex with an Olympian god. When you see the Medusa, you'll understand why she doesn't get out often. One big difference between the original and the remake is Perseus lands a new romantic interest, Io (Gemma Arterton of 'Quantum of Solace') who also serves as his guardian, replaces Andromeda. In the original, Perseus had 30 days to save Princess Andromeda and marry her. Meanwhile, Hades returns to the underworld and gives Acrisius a new lease on life to kill Perseus.Rarely do remakes surpass the original, but 'Clash of the Titans' qualifies as an exception. Meanwhile, 'Clash of the Titans' qualifies as a good adventure opus and our heroes face some rather awesome adversaries. The scorpion fight is good and the giant scorpions come in handy for our heroes. French director Louis Leterrier knows something about pacing movies and this one never slows down. Every one of Leterrier's three previous films—'Unleashed' with Jet Li, 'Transporter 2' with Jason Statham, and 'The Incredible Hulk' with Edward Norton—was a fast-paced fracas that intertwined white-knuckled action with exposition. The single shortcoming of 'Clash of the Titans' is all the narrative information that Leterrier and his writers have to force feed us. The prologue about the gods is essentially repeated later, but you don't have to know squat about the actual Greek myth because the revisions would only serve to confuse you. Worthington makes a credible but sympathetic hero and Gemma Arterton is easy on the eyes. The scenery is breathtaking and the larger-than-life heroics are exciting.",8,3,6,5 April 2010
Jurassic World," Pathetic Compared to Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' Entries
","'Safety Not Guaranteed' director Colin Trevorrow's summer blockbuster 'Jurassic World' surpasses director Joe Johnston's lackluster 'Jurassic Park 3' (2001). Comparatively, Steven Spielberg's infinitely superior 'Jurassic Park' (1993) covered most of what transpires in Trevorrow's new the monster-run-amok-in-a-theme-park movie. Despite its attractive cast and scenic jungle locations, 'Jurassic World' delivers considerably less suspense in its standard-issue shenanigans about juveniles in jeopardy. If you haven't seen the first and second entries in the 'Jurassic Park' trilogy, this franchise reboot with its polished production values and robust 3-D might amaze you, especially if you're sixteen years old or younger. Size is the primary factor 'Jurassic World' contends with, and Trevorrow shrewdly addresses this liability during the first half-hour. The female protagonist who manages the dinosaur park concedes, 'No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore. They need to be bigger, louder and with more teeth!' Indeed, the new hybrid dinosaur that a fiendish scientist has concocted represents a leap forward. Nevertheless, this 50 feet long and 18 feet high monster doesn't really emerge as that monstrous. The Indominus rex in 'Jurassic World' could serve as 'Godzilla's' seeing-eye dog. Moreover, 'Jurassic World' appears to have been designed to sell plastic toy dinosaurs. The dinos themselves display a clean-scrubbed, laminated look. When the franchise first rampaged across screens with 'Jurassic Park' (1993) and its sequel 'Jurassic Park: The Lost World' (1997), nothing looked either more realistic or intimidating than those truculent dinosaurs, especially the Raptors. Unfortunately, the time when 'Jurassic Park' set new benchmarks for CGI is long past. The people who made 'Jurassic World' must have ignored Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' (2005) as well as 'Godzilla' (2014). In an arena with either of those, the welterweight Indominus rex in 'Jurassic World' wouldn't last a minute. Meantime, scenarists Rick Jaffa &Amanda Silver, who did such a praiseworthy job with 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes,' along with writer Rick Connolly, and Trevorrow, have drummed-up a 'so-so sauraus' saga. The logistics of the plot don't hold up to scrutiny and the action is outlandish. Worse, the scripters have contrived one-dimensional characters who often behave idiotically in formulaic predicaments. For example, Bryce Dallas Howard, who was such a revelation as a villainess in 'The Help,' spends her entire time charging around in high heels either in the jungle or on asphalt! Chris Pratt plays a former Navy troubleshooter who doesn't have a lick of sense. He totes around a modern .45-70 lever-action carbine reminiscent of Buffalo Bill, when he should be armed with something more substantial, like a Kalashnikov AK-101 assault rifle with 40mm GP-30 under-the-barrel grenade launcher. One Jurassic World security trooper wields a powerful M136 AT4, a Swedish-made single-shot 84mm unguided light anti-tank recoilless rocket launcher. He takes aim with this fearsome weapon at the genetically modified dinosaur. Naturally, like all myopic, action movie villains, none of these expendable troopers can hit the broad side of a barn, much less a gigantic, galloping dinosaur! Meantime, since the dinosaurs have neither slippery lawyers nor treacherous laboratory employees to gobble, the writers have substituted a different villain, a security specialist who dreams about adapting these carnivorous Raptors for real world combat against terrorists. Not surprisingly, everything about this lightweight, family-oriented, PG-13 rated epic is immaculate. Bloodshed is restricted to a drop or two of runny ketchup. Sure, you see the dinosaurs munch on many adults, but the two imperiled children suffer no broken legs, no sprained ankles, or lose any limbs. Specifically, anonymous bystanders are the only ones that are crunched, scratched, or traumatized. So forget about suspense and tension.Over twenty years ago, in the original 'Jurassic Park' (1993) based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, genial billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) fantasized about opening a dinosaur park on a remote island near Costa Rica. Initially, everything went fine, but then some predatory velociraptors and a cantankerous Tyrannosaurus rex ruined it for everybody. Now, twenty years later, Indian billionaire Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan of 'Life of Pi') has taken over Jurassic Park as the new owner, and he has committed himself whole-heartedly to perpetuating Hammond's dream. He wants both the dinosaurs to enjoy quality of life while the visitors to have a blast. Conversely, Masrani's workaholic chief of operations, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of 'The Help'), struggles to maintain that profit margin. This means the Park must constantly add new attractions because new attractions spike attendance. When fiendish but taciturn scientist, Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong of 'Focus'), devises a new dinosaur, he refuses to share his secret formula with Masrani and Claire. Predictably, chaos ensues with disastrous results. The Indominus rex is smarter than the average dinosaur, and this creature fools everybody, including the impertinent but heroic Owen Grady (Chris Pratt of 'Guardians of the Galaxy'), who struggles to train a quartet of beady-eyed Velociraptors. Using prehistoric lizards like bloodhounds is preposterous but amusing, and the bond Grady develops with these overgrown kangaroo-like predators is unconvincing. Eventually, Grady pursues the Indominus with them, while the Indominus kills on other dinosaurs and crashes into the park's pterosaur aviary to free flocks of their airborne predators.Before he helmed 'Jurassic World,' Colin Trevorrow directed some Internet shorts, a made-for-TV movie, and a superb little 2012 indie flick entitled 'Safety Not Guaranteed' with Mark Duplass. 'Safety Not Guaranteed' was an amiable character-driven comedy of errors. In 'Safety Not Guaranteed,' a couple of journalists investigated a crackpot who has published a newspaper ad soliciting partners to accompany him on a trip back in time. These time travel candidates are advised to bring their own weapons. Reportedly, movie mogul Steven Spielberg liked Trevorrow's film enough to sign him up to direct 'Jurassic World.' If you're a parent, 'Jurassic World' serves not only as ideal entertainment for kids, but also a great way to interest them in dinosaur memorabilia. Otherwise, as far as adults are concerned, the pedestrian 'Jurassic World' exemplifies a case of suspense not guaranteed.'",2,87,172,22 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," The 'Un-Horror' Movie That Scares Up Goosebumps Galore
","'Paranormal Activity' ranks as a good horror chiller that leaves more than enough to your imagination to give you goosebumps galore. It is not one of those pverdone, CGI movies that sets out to scare the crap out of you with buckets of blood and gore backed up by state-of-the-art elaborate, mind-boggling special effects. Instead, this $15-thousand dollar budgeted, minor masterpiece works for its scary moments primarily with subtlety. Freshman writer & director Orel Peli takes his time, carefully develops the action, acquainting us with two very believable characters and makes them seem sympathetic to us. These are not phony, Hollywood idiot characters begging to be possessed. Furthermore, Peli had the good sense to narrow the focus of the picture down to the two foremost characters and not burden us with distractions. In other words, virtually all the action in 'Paranormal Activity' occurs in a house that really isn't that big. The weakest moments occurs with the Ouija board mysteriously bursting into flames and the sight of the demon's hoof-like feet when it traipses through the hero's trail of power on the floor.Katie has been plagued by demons her entire life. She believes that one burned down her home when she was child. Ostensibly, they have returned to make her life miserable. Now, her loyal boyfriend--a San Diego day-trader who takes none of this hokum seriously--resolves to protect Katie. First, he buys a digital video camera and hooks it up to his laptop and leaves it on at night while they sleep. Okay, this part sounds a little like the infamous 'Blair Witch Project,' but 'Paranormal Activity' does not act stupid like BWP. Second, Micha wants to contact the demon but a professional ghost hunter warns him not to do it. Of course, things go bump in the night, leaves burned photos of Katie in the attic and eventually makes our heroine do some odd and unusual things at night, like stand by her bed and watch the sheet slip off the bed while her boyfriend sleeps peacefully. What makes this picture so hypnotic is its utter simplicity. Basically, everything is seen through the lens of Micah's camera. The ending will jolt you.",8,2,6,17 October 2009
Mission: Impossible II," The First Best Entry in the 'Mission Impossible' Franchise
","After the hideous debacle of director Brian De Palma's 'Mission Impossible' movie, Tom Cruise redeemed himself with this exciting, entertaining, and thoroughly exhilarating sequel. If you grew up watching the venerable CBS-TV series that toplined Peter Graves as the head honcho Mr. Phelps, the first movie left a rotten taste in your mouth because Mr. Phelps (the incomparable Jon Voight) treacherously betrayed Ethan Hunt and the rest of the team. The true star of 'MI 2' wasn't the dynamic Cruise. Instead, famous Hong Kong action movie maestro John Woo took the franchise to heights heretofore never scaled with his stylishly orchestrated action sequences and his flying doves. At that time, Woo was known primarily for his foreign actioneers 'The Killer' (1989) and 'Hard-Boiled' (1992), but he had recently come to America and made a name for himself the unforgettable Jean-Claude Van Dame thriller 'Hard Target' (1993) and then surpassed himself with the John Travolta & Christian Slater saga 'Broken Arrow') after which Travolta and Nic Cage teamed up for his splendid law & order yarn 'Face/Off' (1997). Dougray Scott digs his heels in hard as our hero's chief adversary and their showdown on motorcycles is spine-tingling stuff. Thandie Newton plays Cruise's leading lady. 'Chinatown' scenarist Robert Towne, working from a story by future 'Battlestar Galactica' producer Ronald D. Moore and 'Star Trek: First Contact' scribe Brannon Braga, didn't make the same mistake as the origins film.",9,2,3,6 May 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," Men In Gray with Hats and Plans
","Hugo Award winning author Phillip K. Dick penned over 40 science fiction novels and more than 120 short stories. Dick forged a career out of writing about omnipotent corporations and dystopian governments that manipulated people like puppets. Even if sci-fi does not share shelf space with your mainstream literature, you should have heard about him from a number of film adaptations released since his death 1982. For the record, Dick died in 1982, and Hollywood belatedly appropriated his inventive output. Of course, 'Blade Runner' (1982) ranks as the most celebrated Dick adaptation. 'Next' (2007) with Nicolas Cage, 'A Scanner Darkly' (2006) with Keanu Reeves, 'Paycheck' (2005) with Ben Affleck, 'Minority Report'(2002) with Tom Cruise, 'Impostor' (2001) with Gary Sinise, 'Screamers' (1995) with Peter Weller, and 'Total Recall' (1990) with Arnold Schwarzenegger followed in the wake of 'Blade Runner.' The thing that most of these films have in common is that they do little justice to his genius. Freshman writer, producer, and director George Nolfi has done a splendid job turning Dick's 1954 short story 'Adjustment Team' into an entertaining opus with Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Terence Stamp. If you shun sci-fi thrillers because of the gadgetry, jargon, and far-out creatures that dominate so many of these movies, 'The Adjustment Bureau' may appeal to you. Damon does not show up in a space suit and Blunt does not cavort about in some futuristic coiffure. Nobody brandishes either a laser gun or the neutralizer. Alien life forms neither invade Earth nor enslave humanity.Aside from the earlier Dick adaptation 'Paycheck,' 'The Adjustment Bureau' qualifies as the least sci-fi looking epic that you will see. Nevertheless, it concerns a theme that obsessed Dick throughout his life: alternate realities sometimes referred to as simulacra. Damon plays Young, single, unruly Brooklyn-born politician George Norris christened 'the GQ Congressman.' Norris falls in love by a happy coincidence when he encounters a beautiful dancer in the men's room at the elite motel where he maintains his election campaign headquarters. Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt of 'Gnomeo & Juliet') is hiding from motel security because she tried to crash a wedding. Norris struggles to organize his thoughts for a speech conceding his election to his opponent. Initially, he asks if anybody is in the restroom. This is the kind of rest room where the toilet stall doors resemble front doors. When he gets no response, Norris mulls over the wording of his speech. Elise surprises him at the last moment and steps out, and they strike up a conversation that leads to a kiss. No sooner have they concluded their lip-lock than David's long-suffering campaign manager Charlie Traynor (Michael Kelly of 'Law Abiding Citizen') enters and catches a glimpse of Elise as she strolls out. Afterward, David concedes defeat with a speech about the absurd lengths that his campaign went to so that he would attract voters. He talks about the choice of shoes. The shoes have to look nice enough to attract the upper elite without alienating the middle class voters. Although he lost the election, David has proved so charismatic that he won't be overlooked during the next election.Later, David and Elise meet again on a New York City Transit bus. As it turns out, a group of guys are monitoring everything that happens to David and Elise. They dress elegantly but unobtrusively in gray suits and ties. They tote around title books and like to haunt rooftops where they survey the city and make plans. Actually, they don't make plans. More appropriately, they follow plans. When they open their books to check the progress of their plans, we see what looks like a computer screen saver on paper with scribble-like lines and circles. They report to a superior who calls himself 'the Chairman of the Board.' No, the Chairman of the Board is not Frank Sinatra with a harp, a halo, and a hat. In fact, we never see the Chairman of the Board. Nevertheless, this 'Chairman of the Board' might be a supreme deity. Writer & director George Nolfi leaves this up to the imagination of each individual moviegoer. The problem is that the Chairman of the Board that orchestrates the moves that mankind makes wants neither of them to hook up. Indeed, these many mysterious men in hats do their best to keep our hero and heroine apart. Initially, they succeed after the man-in-gray, Harry Mitchell (Will Smith lookalike Anthony Mackie of 'Million Dollar Baby') takes a nap on a city bench and misses a rendezvous with Norris. When he misses colliding with Norris, Harry accidentally allows him to run into Elise on the city bus. The men in gray scramble to make-up for this error by getting to David's office where they try to erase everybody's mind. You can see all of this stuff in the trailer. They warn David that they will zap his mind if he does not play along with them. Specifically, they don't want him to meet Elise because she is destined to become America's greatest dancer. If they get together, he will destroy her career as well as sidetrack his own political aspirations. Predictably, the Damon protagonist refuses to be manipulated, even if these enigmatic gentlemen threaten to erase his mind. Sounds a bit like 'Men in Black?' Nevertheless, he does everything within his power to thwart these people who would keep the woman of his dreams and he apart in this exciting romantic thriller. The closest movie to 'The Adjustment Bureau' that seasoned sci-fi aficionados may recall is director Alex Proyas's second film, the neo-noir 'Dark City' (1998) where aliens recreated an Earth-like environment and conducted endless experiments to understand the essence of humanity. Unlike 'Dark City,' 'The Adjustment Bureau' prefers to be more cerebral than sci-fi.",9,3,5,5 March 2011
Black Hawk Down," None But The Valiant!
","The exciting Ridley Scott combat actioneer 'Black Hawk Down' ranks as one of the best military movies to come out of Hollywood. Not only does this gritty, engrossing reenactment of real-life gallantry surpass the patriotic, blood-drenched June 6th, 1944 Normandy landing that director Steven Spielberg depicted in 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), but 'Black Hawk Down' also shuns any of those hollow, sentimental, gung-ho John Wayne-style heroics from World War II era movies. From its anti-heroic opening quote by Plato that observes: 'Only the dead have seen the end of war,' 'Black Hawk Down unfolds as a stark, searing tribute to the valor of elite American troops caught up in deadliest firefight since Vietnam. Not since director Cy Endfield make the memorable 1964 Michael Caine epic 'Zulu' about a brave handful of out-numbered British soldiers holding off hordes of savage, bloodthirsty Zulu warriors in 1879 has a movie plunged its protagonists in such a suicidal situation. Rarely has a film shown its heroes trapped as tragically between a rock and a hard place as 'Black Hawk Down.' Lensed on location in Morocco by 'Proof of Life' cinematographer Slawomir Idziak with Pentagon cooperation, this unforgettable, non-fiction narrative about an ill-fated 1993 raid by 123 elite U.S. soldiers into Mogadishu, Somalia, captured the blood, sweat, and fear that Philadelphia Inquirer staff reporter Mark Bowden immortalized in his riveting 1998 bestseller. War qualifies as nothing but Hell in the adaptation of the Bowden narrative by freshman scenarist Ken Nolan who sticks closely to the truth in this blow-by-blow chronicle of a good mission gone bad. In 1992, famine swept Somalia, and several sadistic, heavily-armed warlords clashed over control of their East African country while they deprived without mercy their own starving citizens of United Nations food shipments. No sooner had a U.N. peacekeeping force, including 20-thousand U.S. Marines, restored law and order than factional fighting erupted again. General Muhammad Farah Aidid emerged as the notorious culprit-at-large. U.S. Army Rangers and Team Delta Force flew in to arrest both Aidid and his lieutenants.Although the American forces never nabbed Aidid, they located two of his subordinates. In October 1993, U.S. General William Garrison (Sam Sheppard of 'Swordfish') dispatched the Delta Force to snatch the Aidid underlings in an urban ghetto right under the noses of thousands of trigger-happy, pugnacious Somalia militia doped-up and itching for action. U.S. Army Rangers ropes in from four Black Hawk helicopters to provide cover for the Delta Force troops as they piled their prisoners into a convoy of Humvees. Practically everything went off like clockwork until waves of Somalias surprised our guys and wielded RPGs, deadly grenade-launching weapons, to blast two choppers out of the sky. A perfect mission which should have lasted a mere 30 minutes bogged down into a 15-hour fiasco as undermanned American troops fought tooth-and-nail to recover their fallen comrades and clear out.Director Ridley Scott, whose credits include 'Alien,' 'G.I. Jane,' and 'Gladiator,' pulls few punches in this harrowing, high-octane, bullet-riddle, adrenalin-laced opus. If the sight of guts, gore, and mutilated flesh makes you feel queasy, avoid this nerve-racking exercise in the horror of combat. Scott endows 'Black Hawk Down' with a raw-edged, documentary flavor that his gifted cast of little-known actors and up-and-coming stars, such as 'Pearl Harbor' heartthrob Josh Hartnell and Ewan McGregor of 'Star Wars: Episode One,' enhance with their believable, low-key performances.",10,2,5,2 January 2010
The Hangover Part II," Only Half As Good As 'The Hangover'
","Clearly, 'Old School' director Todd Phillips subscribes to the saying if something ain't broke, don't fix it. 'The Hangover Part II' reassembles all the fellows but few of the gals from its genuinely hilarious predecessor about the antics of an outlandish Las Vegas bachelor party gone awry. If you thought 'The Hangover' was rude, crude, and morally offensive, 'Hangover Part 2' makes the 2009 film appear tame by comparison. Not since 'The Crying Game' (1992) has a film sunk to the comic excesses that 'The Hangover Part II' dares. Sadly, some of the best things about the blockbuster original do not recur in the predictable, but raunchy, R-rated sequel. Basically, 'The Hangover Part II' qualifies as only half as funny as the first film. What Phillips could not replicate in terms of riotous wit, he has replaced with shocking revelations. Prepare yourself for something you may have never seen. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons that Phillips set the sequel in the exotic orient was to take advantage of a far more liberal climate concerning sexual identity that is about as perverted as anything that modern, mainstream Americans can imagine. Were it not for the gifted ensemble cast, including Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong, the half of 'Hangover 2' that is hilarious wouldn't be as memorable. Galifianakis takes the smallest things and makes them side-splitting. For example, every time he says Thailand, he says 'thigh-land' rather than 'tie-land.' Galifianakis and Jeong compete to see who can get the biggest laughs. Mind you, 'The Hangover 2' is not without its share of surprises. Some surprises are amusing, while others add nothing but complications to a contrived plot. Comparably, Phillips makes Thailand appear far more unsavory than Las Vegas could ever hope even with its shady criminal heritage. Depending on your perspective, 'Hangover 2' makes Bangkok look like either the most sizzling place you could set your sights on or the last place this side of Hell that you would visit. Indeed, one of the revelations about a character who vanishes turns out to be less sinister than you might expect given the reputation of this 'anything goes' Southeast Asia country.Two years after their shenanigans in Las Vegas, Stu (Ed Helms of 'Evan Almighty') is scheduled to marry Asian dish Lauren (Jamie Chung of 'Sucker Punch') in her homeland on the other side of the world at a picturesque sea-side resort. Initially, Stu has agreed to invite only Phil (Bradley Cooper of 'Limitless') and Doug (Justin Bartha of 'Failure to Launch') with no thought about moronic Alan. The bachelor brunch that Stu has in mind, however, takes place stateside at an I-HOP before he hops onto a jet. Eventually, an irate Phil prods Stu into throwing a bachelor bash in Thailand. Nevertheless, Stu doesn't want to relive the wolf pack antics of their previous escapade. Just as they are about to leave for the exotic Orient, Doug convinces a reluctant Phil to invite mischievous but well-meaning man-child Alan (Zach Galifianakis of 'Due Date') on the condition that Alan doesn't spike their libations with roofies. Things get off to an uneasy start in Thailand for poor Stu because his future father-in-law, Lauren's stern patriarch, Fohn (Nirut Sirijanya of 'Ong Bak 3'), roasts him at the wedding rehearsal party. Fohn thoroughly loathes the milquetoast dentist. Indeed, Fohn compares Stu to lukewarm rice. Meanwhile, Fohn lavishes praise and attention on his quiet, 16-year-old Stanford freshman son (Mason Lee of 'The Wedding Banquet') majoring in pre-med who plays the cello like a master.After the party, Phil, Stu, Doug, and Teddy gather on the beach for a benign party around a bonfire with beer and marshmallows. No sooner is all that said and done than they awaken the following morning in the seediest motel Bangkok. They are surprised to learn their old Las Vegas gangster nemesis, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong of 'Role Models'), has spent the night partying with them. As it turns, Doug wisely left the party before everybody headed into Bangkok. After the guys wake up, Chow suddenly keels over face-down into a plate-glass table from snorting too much cocaine. Worse, the only thing left of Teddy is his severed finger with a Stanford ring. This time around Alan is shocked that his head has been shaved, and Stu freaks out over a tattoo on the left temple that resembles the one Mike Tyson sported in 'The Hangover.' First, the wolf pack disposes of Chow's body. Wrapping it in towels, they stash it in an ice-making machine. Afterward, they retrace their steps so they can learn what happened to Teddy. The fellows find out that they burned down a bar, cavorted with some questionable gals, and ran afoul of some trigger-happy thugs. Along the way, they encounter another equally dangerous gangster, Kingsley (Paul Giamatti of 'Sideways'), who not only has a million dollar deal with Mr. Chow, but also knows about Teddy's whereabouts. Our baffled heroes also find out that the electricity in Bangkok has a way of going out when they least expect it.Phillips and freshman scribes Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong spend the first formulaic thirty minutes getting the wolf pack back together before they fly them off to Bangkok. Like the first movie, 'The Hangover Part 2' opens with Phil making his inevitable phone call to warn the wedding party that they have encountered some slight difficulties. The filmmakers replace Mike Tyson's roaring tiger with a drug-dealing, cigarette-smoking capuchin monkey in a Rolling Stones' outfit. Phillips orchestrates a roller-coaster chase through Bangkok that looks like something out of 'Smoky and the Bandit.' Ultimately, Stu solves a mystery about himself that will either embarrass you with its tawdry tastelessness or having you laugh so hard that you'll burst a blood vessel. Altogether, 'The Hangover Part 2' is unforgettable in the worst and best ways, but it never crackles with the spontaneity that made 'The Hangover' so insanely entertaining.",5,2,4,6 June 2011
Prisoners," Terrific Thriller with Some Taboo Subject Matter
","Watching the disturbing Hugh Jackman child abduction thriller 'Prisoners' is like rubbernecking at the scene of a car accident. Initially, your curiosity gets the best of you and gawk. Of course, the sight of the blood and gore sickens you. Nevertheless, you can't take your eyes off it because it makes you consider your own mortality. 'Prisoners' keeps the blood and gore to a minimum, but the nature of the crimes leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Oscar-nominated French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and 'Contraband' scenarist Aaron Guzikowski have created a compelling criminal melodrama that shuns the usual Hollywood glitz and glamor. Indeed, the filmmakers accentuate realism at every turn. The squeamish might reconsider seeing this tragic tale. The unwholesome subject of child abduction qualifies as heavyweight material, and 'Prisoners' never resorts to humor to lighten the atmosphere. Actually, the dreadful events in this narrative may challenge your ability to enjoy this intense psychological character study. Clocking in at 153 minutes, 'Prisoners' is relentless both in its length and depth. I can't say enough good things about this inspired but unsavory crime drama. The characters stand out boldly from the background. Each emerges with greater depth and irony than Hollywood allows, and Villeneuve generates considerable, white-knuckled suspense. Sometimes, the quietest moments prove to be the most suspenseful. Comparably, 'Prisoners' resembles an episode of the CBS-TV crime series 'Criminal Minds,' but clean-scrubbed, well-dressed, FBI agents aren't investigating the crime. The local authorities handle the case and display appalling incompetence. A father turns into a vigilante and passes the point of no return to save his daughter. Nobody in this grim, lurid yarn is without a flaw. You won't want to be like them because they lose their cool. 'Prisoners' is about a lot of good people doing all the wrong things. When a small-time carpenter, Dover Keller (Hugh Jackman of 'The Wolverine'), isn't in the woods hunting with his son, he dotes on his adorable, six-year old daughter. Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and her African-American girlfriend, Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), are playing in their quiet, suburban neighborhood when they notice a recreational vehicle parked on the street. Dover and his best friend Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard of 'Iron Man') and their wives and older children are enjoying a peaceful Thanksgiving dinner when the girls turn up missing. Earlier, Dover had told his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and Birch's daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) to keep tabs on the youngsters. They search the neighborhood but find no traces of either Anna or Joy. Eventually, a police organize a widespread man hunt, with Dover and his son trudging through the woods with an army of other people. Dover's wife Grace (Maria Bello of 'Payback') has retreated to her bed with pills galore while her husband counts the hours. Meantime, the police spot the suspicious vehicle near a convenience store, and Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal of 'End of Watch') arrives and approaches it with his gun drawn. The driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano of 'Cowboys & Aliens'), behaves hysterically at the sight of all the flashing blue lights. Jones tries to drive off the premises. Instead, he careens into the woods and smashes up the vehicle. Loki arrests Alex, but Loki's police chief superior releases him later because they found no incriminating evidence either on him or in the RV. Enraged at Alex's early release, Dover confronts him in the parking lot, and the police have to restrain Dover. Later, Dover abducts Alex and tortures him. He demands that Alex reveal the whereabouts of his daughter and her companion. Alex repeatedly tells him that he knows nothing about Anna and Joy. Grimly, Dover devises other ways to torture Alex. Meantime, Detective Loki is on the trail of a bizarre individual who buys children's apparel despite the fact that he has no children. Moreover, he stores the apparel in locked plastic tubs writhing with snakes. As you can see, nothing about 'Prisoners' is lightweight. The scene near the end when Loki careens desperately through traffic to reach the hospital will have you poised on the edge of your seat. One major surprise occurs about three-fourths of the way through 'Prisoners' when the identity of the villain who is behind a child abduction ring is divulged. By this time, Franklin and Nancy Birch have visited the sight of Dover's torture chamber and allow him to continue with this disgraceful business. Hugh Jackman delivers a shattering performance as a father prepared to torture another human if it will prolong his daughter's life. You've never Jackman play a deranged character like Dover Keller. Keller believes devoutly that his actions are appropriate. Moreover, Keller's closest friends don't flinch at his merciless interrogation techniques. In essentially supporting roles, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Paul Dano, and Melissa Leo all distinguish themselves. As the grieving parents, Bello, Davis, and Howard are far more sympathetic than Jackman's distraught father. Paul Dano allows his behavior and bizarre appearance do most of his acting for him. Altogether, Dano emerges as one creepy worm of a guy. Ultimately, Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance of his career as a detective who struggles to find clues in the disappearance of two little girls from their neighborhood. Suffice to say, although it qualifies as a superior thriller, 'Prisoners' will rattle your cage.",10,2,4,29 September 2013
Logan," Marvelous Marvel Masterpiece!!!
","Twentieth Century Fox has brought the curtain down on its original 'X-Men' franchise with the 'Wolverine' spin-off 'Logan,' co-starring Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart. 'Wolverine' writer & director James Mangold's abrasive, slam-bang, but valedictory entry doesn't resemble the usual, optimistic, hyperbolic, Marvel spectacle with a vibrant ending. Mangold and scenarists Scott Frank of 'The Wolverine' and Michael Green of 'Green Lantern' have formulated an often violent, profane saga set twelve years into the future. Jackman and Stewart claim this movie marks the last time they will portray Wolverine and Professor Xavier. Unlike earlier franchise entries, 'Logan' arrives with an R-rating for its 'strong brutal violence and language throughout, and for brief nudity.' Saying that 'Logan' sheds the kid gloves that previous 'X-Men'/ 'Wolverine' movies wore amounts to an understatement. The 'Kids in the Mind' website, for example, counted as many as 53 F-words and its derivatives, 24 scatological expressions, 9 anatomical names, and 6 minor obscenities. Although enough blood & gore flows for a half-dozen movies, the ferocity of watching various characters getting viciously battered as well as slashed and gouged constantly, usually with multiple blades skewering heads should keep squeamish audiences screaming and gorehounds drooling. 'Logan' doesn't confine its murderous mayhem strictly to its valiant heroes and slimy villains. This anything-goes opus slaughters innocent bystanders with relative indifference. The thing to remember about 'Logan' is Twentieth Century Fox produced it rather than Disney Marvel, so it doesn't resemble 'Iron Man,' 'Thor,' 'The Incredible Hulk,' 'The Avengers,' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' Mind you, the 'X-Men' movie franchise probably won't vanish altogether since James McAvoy may still reprise his younger Professor Xavier, while a different actor will inevitably deploy those retractable, razor-sharp, adamantium claws that Hugh Jackman has wielded with such finesse in nine X-Men films over 17 years.First, 'Logan' takes place in the year 2029. Although everything appears contemporary, Mangold has inserted some thought-provoking, futuristic touches, such as self-driving tractor-trailer rigs that careen along the highways oblivious to the safety of other motorists. Second, the heroes and villains dress like ordinary people, and Logan and Professor Xavier are far older than we've ever seen them. They are hiding out when the film unfolds, and Professor Xavier suffers from degenerative brain disease. Indeed, Xavier relies entirely on Logan to protect him from unscrupulous people that want to seize the man with 'most dangerous mind.' The two have sought refuge across the border in Mexico, and Logan works as a limo driver. He manages with considerable difficulty to keep Professor Xavier on medications that prevent him from suffering terrible psychic seizures. These seizures constitute the equivalent of earthquakes that can paralyze people in their shoes. Some audiences may be turned off by the commonplace reality with which Mangold and his writers have wall-papered 'Logan.' Jackman's grandpa version of the Wolverine is comparable to Frank Miller's depiction of an older Batman in the graphic novel 'The Dark Knight Returns,' except Logan is in far worse physical condition. Indeed, Logan can still slice and dice his adversaries like a Christmas turkey, but his healing powers have waned. A physician warns Wolverine that he may be suffering from adamantium poisoning. The first scene shows Logan awakening from a siesta in his luxurious 2024 Chrysler limo to find a gang of truculent border trash trying to steal his tires. Our hero approaches them, and a fracas erupts that leaves several either dead or wounded. Wolverine, however, emerges the worst for wear, staggering about clumsily as he slashes and gashes his aggressive opponents who blast away at him. He is often shown repeatedly guzzling liquor and dresses in a sloppy manner. Director James Mangold stages Logan's hand-to-hand combat scenes so each battle has a chaotic and frenzied spontaneity. Nothing about the fights that ensue appear visually cool and kinetic as they were in earlier 'X-Men' films. Sometimes, Logan looks like he is going to lose until he lets his rage fuel his ferocity. Logan discovers that a desperate Mexican woman, Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez of 'Miami Vice'), has been following him. She has a group of mutant children with her. These children are not only trying to elude the henchmen, but they also trying to reach safety across the Canadian border. She pleads with Wolverine to drive them to their destination. He refuses to acknowledge her presence, but then discovers that an obnoxious enforcer, Pierce (Boyd Holbrook of 'Run All Night'), with a mechanical hand and a cynical Southern drawl, from the Mexican research facility Transigen wants to recapture the children. These children are laboratory mutants on the lam. One of them, Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen), brandishes lethal claws like Wolverine; she may be reserved and pint-sized but those claws do her talking. She demonstrates her savagery when she beheads the Goliath-like henchman sent to seize her.'Logan' boasts several exciting confrontations as Wolverine and Laura make mincemeat out of an overwhelming number of adversaries. The beauty of these scenes is that the hapless enemy doesn't have a clue about their impending demise. Mangold and company generate one surprise after another as Wolverine and Professor Xavier flee from Pierce and his legion of hooligans on a road trip. Laura accompanies them and earns their respect as a devastating killing machine, and her combat scenes are extraordinary. Eventually, new nemesis Dr. Xander Rice (Richard E. Grant of 'Hudson Hawk'), who wants the children captured, loosens his ultimate secret weapon X-24 that battles Wolverine to a virtual stalemate. The avalanche of tragic events that accumulate as 'Logan' spirals toward its twilight of the gods ending may sadden some moviegoers. Furthermore, the dearth of backstory about the conspicuous absence of the other X-Men qualifies as 'Logan's' solitary shortcoming. As the wizened Wolverine, Hugh Jackman evokes sympathy. Patrick Stewart fares no less admirable as the dementia-afflicted Professor Xavier who struggles to come to terms with his murky past. Altogether, 'Logan' is unforgettable! Incidentally, a hilarious skit with Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool serves as a prologue.",9,7,13,18 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Whedon Triumphs Again With Avengers!!!
","Watching 'Serenity' director Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron' is like riding on a runaway roller-coaster. As he did with the initial 'Avengers' extravaganza, Whedon orchestrates several larger-than-life, gravity-defying, high-octane action scenes that grow exponentially bigger and bigger. Not content to dawdle, Whedon opens this PG-13 film with an exciting assault on a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe. Ultimately, he never allows this outlandish, CGI-laden, 141 minute blockbuster with its non-stop shenanigans to wax anticlimactic. Occasionally, 'Avengers 2,' as I shall refer to it from here on, pauses only to let the heroes and villains deliver important expository information that lets us know about their impending strategy. Whedon relies frequently on rapid, ginsu-knife style editing to depict simultaneous close-quarters combat in different spots among the various super-heroes as they spar with their adversaries and recover from body blows no ordinary mortal could survive. One of my favorites occurs when Thor slams his hammer named Mjölnir against Captain America's shield and sends it hurtling like a giant Frisbee to topple more than a few baddies. Comparatively, not only for its number of narrative surprises but also for its revelations about certain characters, 'Avengers 2' surpasses its 2012 predecessor. Whedon discloses far more about Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow than previous Marvel movies, and we find out about Hawkeye's private family life. As it turns out, Hawkeye enjoys home renovation and brings the subject up in the middle of an explosive firefight. During this helter-skelter cliffhanger, Whedon brings in three fresh characters: the obnoxious A.I. robot villain Ultron along with the brother and sister duo Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. Actually, if you saw 20th Century Fox's epic 'X-Men: Days of Future Past,' you've seen the same character with a slightly different moniker. In the 'X-Men' opus, Pietro was called Peter, and he shared the same ability to move so fast that most of what you saw was a blur. Another new character crops up in this ambitious sequel, but I'll leave you to learn about him on your own. Die-hard Marvel fans should enjoy this big, boisterous, slam-bang saga as much if not more than the original. Of course, anybody who read the original comic book will howl at the departures. Many of the Marvel characters are owned by different film studios, so fidelity to the source material in this cinematic adaptation was impossible without copyright infringement.Inevitably, this charismatic new nemesis infuriates our heroes with its dreams of global Armageddon. 'Blacklist' star James Spader furnishes the villain's voice. Listening to Spader indulge in his penchant for loquacity is always a joy, and he savors every line of dialogue for maximum effect. Spader plays the eponymous, sentient robotic villain Ultron, and he is more than a match for Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. Visually, Ultron amounts to an imposing dastard, and he displays no qualms about exterminating mankind on the grandest of scales. He clones an entire robot army to perform his perfidious deeds. Interestingly, he can teleport from one android to another without exposing himself. Naturally, our heroes can never tell if Ultron is the actual robot that they are trying to smash to smithereens. Meanwhile, Pietro and Wanda prove to be challenging adversaries when they tangle with our resilient heroes. Indeed, as Ultron's chief lieutenants, they could easily have defeated the Avengers. Unfortunately, drastic things happen about an hour into the action that makes them alter their allegiance. For the record, the ABC-TV Marvel series 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' set the events into motion in 'Avengers 2's' first scene. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg of 'Iron Man') had infiltrated the impregnable Hydra headquarters of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann of 'Valkyrie') and located Loki's powerful scepter. The Avengers were dispatched to retrieve the scepter. The ensuing fracas resembles something from a World War II battle spectacle. Naturally, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) demolishes bunkers, while Captain America careens around on his motorcycle. Thor wields Mjölnir with pugnacious abandon. Amid this chaos, Whedon trots twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of 'Savages') and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen of 'Oldboy') who have voluntarily participated in the Baron's experiments. Pietro can scurry in a hurry like 'The Flash,' while Wanda can alter minds and heave flaming spheres of energy. Against Strucker's orders, the twins take part in the mêlée, but they aren't around long enough to turn the tide. Later, Ultron exploits them to the utmost. Wanda monkeys with the minds of our heroes, and the Avengers come close to splitting up because they don't trust each other. The delusions that Wanda's skullduggery have forged in Tony Stark's mind as well as Thor's are apocalyptic. At one point, Thor abandons the group to delve deeper into his Armageddon nightmare. None of the heroes are really slighted, but Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Widow claim the lion's share of the warfare. Nevertheless, Thor, Hawkeye, and Hulk get in their licks, too.Several spectators have complained that 'Avengers 2' suffers from fatigue-inducing, marathon-length, combat encounters that last for an eternity. What else would you expect from an outrageous, sci-fi, super-hero saga drawn from a comic book about a unit of costume-clad superheroes? Keep in mind, 'Avengers 2' is NOT 'Downtown Abbey.' Whedon slows down the hurtling, headlong pace just long enough for our heroes to reflect on their horrendous predicament and then they regroup to thwart the villains. All of this is achieved with the brand of humor characteristic of a Disney franchise. Compare 20th Century Fox's Marvel movies, such as 'X-Men,' 'Daredevil,' and 'The Fantastic Four,' that you'll see that they are just a mite more serious about their mayhem than Disney. Having said such, you'll be happy to know that Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, and Samuel L. Jackson all return for this revelry. 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron' qualifies as a terrific movie, and it looks fantastic in 3-D.",10,2,9,17 May 2015
The Insider," Journalistic Integrity Under Fire
","'Miami Vice' creator Michael Mann's hard-hitting expose about journalistic integrity in the controversial tobacco lawsuit involving whistle blower Jeffry Wigand is a devastating study about freedom of the press in a capitalistic society. Initially, when I saw 'The Insider' for the first time, I thought it was going to be strictly about Wigand and the obstacles that he had to overcome to reveal the truth about the tobacco industry. Instead, 'The Insider' concerns former CBS-TV producer Lowell Bergman's reputation as an honest man. Everything starts out with Bergman receiving a box of documents about the burn rate of cigarettes involved in fires that kill people who go to sleep with lighted cigarettes. Bergman peruses the documents, but he doesn't understand them so he searches for somebody who can explain to him what the documents mean. He crosses paths with a tobacco industry executive, Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe of 'Romper Stomper'), who has just been fired from a company because he suffers a crisis of conscience. Wigand's former employers threaten to cut all his severance package unless he inks more confidential documents. Ultimately, he refuses to concede to Thomas Sandefur's demands. Not only does Wigand lose his comfortable house but also he eventually loses his wife. Meanwhile, Bergman assures Wigand that he has his best interests at heart and he won't betray him. CBS News is set to broadcast a segment on its television magazine news program '60 Minutes' with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer of 'Triple Cross') questioning him about the truth about nicotine and its hazards. The Big Tobacco companies swing into action and feed scandalous material to The Wall Street Journal when they are slapping restraining orders on Wigand. Interestingly enough, the state of Mississippi and Attorney General Mike Moore (Mike Moore) with Richard Scruggs depose Wigand. Just when things are looking good, CBS-TV gets a case of cold feet and runs their story without Wigand's interview. Bergman becomes a whistle blower in his own company and talks to a 'New York Times'newspaper reporter about the scandal while at the same time he convinces 'The Wall Street Journal' not to publish an expose about Wigand that is made up with half-truths and contradictions. In the end, CBS-TV broadcasts the Wigand interview, but Bergman quits because he knows that he cannot be honest in the future with other prospective news makers. Mann and scenarist Eric Roth deliver both barrels of a double-barreled shotgun indictment that is memorable and damning. The tobacco industry almost got away with scaring not just a whistle blower but also a national news organization. Al Pacino is wonderful as Bergman, and Russell Crowe convinces us that he is the man under the microscope who had everything to lose except his conscientiousness. People who boast about America as a bastion of freedom and journalism as an objective industry free of bias should watch this film and think about what it means. Audiences that crave action and entertainment may find this sizzling expose boring because little in the way of gripping or suspenseful action transpires during its two hour plus running time. Nevertheless, as a whistle blower saga, 'The Insider' is insightful stuff that should be watched. Mann's film received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.",10,3,3,30 March 2014
The Dark Knight," 'The Dark Knight' Is Too Much Of A Good Thing!
","'Batman Begins' writer & director Christopher Nolan's new Caped Crusader saga 'The Dark Knight' qualifies as too much of a good thing. In other words, the movie boasts greater ambitions than its lengthy 152 minutes can accommodate. Mind you, 'The Dark Knight' is every bit as good as 'Batman Begins.' The chief difference is that this Batman sequel flaunts bigger and better production values as well as loftier aims.Not only does 'The Dark Knight' align our hero with Bob Kane's original vigilante creation, but it also reinvents the Batman's nefarious nemesis, the Harlequin of Hatethe Joker. The Joker drives Batman over the edge! He ranks as an unforgettable villain. While Nolan and his brother Jonathan remain faithful to the spirit of Kane's Batman, this sequel indulges in derring-do more outlandish and audacious than its predecessor and depicts the showdown between Batman and the Joke as a duel of titans.During its initial two hours, this white-knuckled, larger-than-life, adventure epic keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it sacrifices that momentum in the last 30 minutes with a convoluted subplot that turns into a predictable and pretentious mediation on good citizenship. Although Batman has been around since 1939, the Nolan brothers deserve kudos for taking this unique American crime fighter to the next level. Furthermore, amid all the adrenaline-laced activities and high octane explosions, the Nolans have concocted a crackerjack near-classic with more on its mind that hair-raising heroics.'The Dark Knight' opens with an imaginative bank robbery. Gun-toting, clown-faced robbers kill each other as each completes their phase of the crime. The hold-up and the getaway are nimbly staged, except there's an inherent flaw. If you think about it, how can the Joker recruit high-class henchmen if he has them knock each other off? Nevertheless, we learn quickly that the Joker is the ultimate anarchist. He refuses to play by the rules, and the Nolans generate a lot of melodrama about Batman's vigilante efforts to apprehend him. 'Hancock' beat 'The Dark Knight' to the punch about the price of vigilantism. Not only do the authorities want to catch the Joker, but they also wouldn't mind nabbing the Batman.Incorruptible Lieutenant Jim Gordon (a mustached and bespectacled Gary Oldman of 'True Romance') is the only cop that Batman trusts. Naturally, Gordon is reluctant to let crusading Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart of 'No Reservations') into the loop. Although the mobsters have been piling up loot, laundering it, and then hiding it in Gotham's banks with a Chinese gangster Lau (Chin Han of '3 Needles') protecting their earnings, Batman and Lt. Gordon devise a clever way to identify mob money. Inevitably, the Asian mastermind skips Gotham for the sanctuary of China where he expects to escape extradition. Batman shocks Lau with a surprise visit. The Caped Crusader's excursion beyond Gotham City constitutes a first for the film franchise. Batman's abduction of the Asian crime lord resembles similar abductions from the John Wayne Vietnam war movie 'The Green Beret' and the Timothy Dalton 007 caper 'License to Kill.' No sooner have the authorities jailed Lau than the Joker approaches Gotham City's criminal cartel with a new plan. The Joker's first scene where he makes a pencil disappear is hilarious. Meanwhile, since Wayne Manor melted down in 'Batman Begins,' our hero has had to relocate to make-shift quarters. Bruce Wayne realizes that Batman is something bigger than he had imagined, including the copycat Batmen prowling the city. Being the Batman, as 'The Dark Knight' shows, is no picnic. Our hero has acquired his share of bruises, wounds, and dog bites, and he has his top man at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman of 'Unforgiven'), developing a dog-proof Bat suit. Despite his crime busting exploits, Bruce yearns for the day that he can drop the masquerade and wed childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. The nihilistic Joker doesn't give him much breathing room in this installment.Warner Brothers, DC Comics and the Nolan brothers will have to manufacture a miracle to top this slam-bang, gravity-defying actioneer. Christian Bale surpasses Michael Keaton, George Clooney, and Val Kilmer as Batman. Bale's Batman is more realistic, more sympathetic, and the Welsh star's lean wolfish looks make him look treacherous. In short, Bale is the best Batman since Adam West! The late Heath Ledger really gets under the clown make-up as the Joker. Aaron Eckhart's vigorous performance as Harvey Dent is no less sterling. Alas, the Nolans give Dent the short shrift when they shoehorn his dramatic makeover carelessly in the final half-hour. Leggy Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't much of an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Composers Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard provide a powerful, atmospheric orchestral score that sets the mood and accentuates the cliffhanger heroics. At the same time, Christopher Nolan wastes no time getting the action in gear. Nolan maintains momentum and suspense while scattering surprises throughout the mayhem. Only during the last 30 minutes does the story begin to unravel. No, 'The Dark Knight' isn't the masterpiece that 'Iron Man' was, but this latest entry in the Batman franchise proves you can have your Cape and eat it, too!",10,5,11,29 July 2008
Friends with Benefits," When Justin Met Mila . . .
","It is difficult to believe that talented 'Easy A' writer & director Will Gluck had anything to do with this shallow as well as satiric romantic comedy about a loquacious couple who tumble in the sack but shun wearing their feelings on the their respective sleeves. You'd think that these youngsters were the first who preferred sex without sentiment. Each of these commitment-leery lovers has been through the wringer in a previous relationship that left them with nothing but bad vibes and the desire to never succumb so such sadness again. Sexy Mila Kunis plays a single but sexually active corporate headhunter named Jamie who recruits Los Angeles-based website editor Dylan (Justin Timberlake of 'The Social Network') to be the new art director opening at GQ magazine. Predictably, not only does Dylan take this dream job, but he also bundles up with Jamie in bed in an R-rated movie that lacks both steam and momentum. You will find about as much meaningful nudity here as you might find in an issue of Maxim magazine. The entire plot revolves around their relationship after coitus and the ups and downs that they endure before Gluck and scenarists Keith Merryman and David A. Newman bring the leads full circle in Grand Central Station in the Big Apple. Just to add some sparkle to the shenanigans we are treated to Patricia Clarkson cast as the liberated mom of our heroine who raves about the 1970s and Woody Harrelson as Tommy an openly gay sports writer. 'Saturday Night Live' fans will recognize Andy Samberg breaking up with Mila in an opening gambit while Emma Stone ditches Timberlake. Probably the slickest thing that Gluck pulls off is his surprising cross-cutting between the guys and the gals in this scene. Initially, we assume that Mila and Jamie are breaking up until we see that it is two couples. Richard Jenkins injects some heavy-handed gravitas as Jamie's Alzheimer's addled father who steals every scene in which he appears. Gluck tries his best (or worst) to skewer the conventions of romantic comedies, but he only winds up skewering himself. Mind you, Mila has some nice-looking skin and Justin has a washboard belly to die-for if you're into looking physically fit. Unfortunately, good looks, great chemistry, and rapid-fire dialogue delivery cannot overcome the one cliché after another. Altogether, if you have not seen 'When Harry Met Sally,' watch 'When Harry Met Sally after you see 'Friends with Benefits.'",Null,3,4,1 August 2011
"Girl, Interrupted"," Hanging With A Neurotic
","'Girl Interrupted,' starring Winona Ryder and Golden Globe winner Angelina Jolie, is 'The Snake Pit' with snakes.If you've never seen 'The Snake Pit,' Olivia de Havilland of 'Gone with the Wind' fame played a young housewife that suffered a nervous breakdown and wound up in a notorious mental institution. Nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in 1948, this grim, unrelenting expose chronicled one woman's descent into insanity and her struggle to recover. Until Jack Nicholson came along in 1975 with Milos Foreman's 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,' all insane asylum movies were measured against 'The Snake Pit.' Of course, there had been other interesting asylum movies, such as two that appeared in 1955: Jose Ferrer's 'The Shrike' (1955) and Vincente Minnelli's 'The Cobweb.' In 'Girl Interrupted,' Winona Ryder of 'Heathers' fame plays a neurotic high school graduate diagnosed with 'borderline personality disorder.' Meaning, she experiences confusion about her identity, her long-term goals, her friends, and her moral values. After she makes a half-hearted attempt to kill herself by chasing a bottle of aspirin with Vodka, her physician advises that she commit herself. Susan Kaysen's bestselling memoir serves as the factual basis of 'Girl Interrupted.' Naturally, 'Copland' director James Mangold stretches the truth, but he doesn't stretch it so much that you would notice the discrepancy.This lightweight but absorbing melodrama boasts a terrific ensemble cast with Oscar caliber performances, especially from future 'Laura Croft' star Angelina Jolie, but it is a far cry from either 'The Snake Pit' or 'The Cuckoo's Nest.' 'Girl Interrupted' dramatizes Kaysen's two year stint at Claymoore, the fictional counterpart to a real life private psychiatric clinic near Boston, Massachusetts. Sure, Susan (Winona Ryder) survives the ordeal and emerges none the worst for wear. Such is not the case for her unfortunate fellow inmates. When our protagonist arrives at Claymoore, Lisa (Angelina Jolie), the prototypical bad girl patient with keen insight into everybody's problems, takes her under wing and shows her the ropes. Predictably, Lisa emerges as a horrid influence. Eventually, Susan realizes that she must quit trying to buck the system and come to grips with reality.Although it shuns the usual mental ward movie stereotypes, 'Girl Interrupted' never lingers long on anything unpleasant; after all, this is a chick flick for teens and twentysomethings. Occasionally, somebody finds herself strapped up in a straitjacket, but frequently they frolic without fear, after the nightly bed checks, raid the patient files to catch up on what the therapists are writing about them, or escape on harmless excursions.Okay, one girl commits suicide by hanging herself, but the worst thing that happens to Winona's character is that helpful Whoopi Goldberg pushes her into a tub of cold water and reprimands her. Despite all the rules, attendants, and stern but sympathetic nurses, our heroines come and go as they please with moderate supervision. 'Girl Interrupted' resembles a cross-between of TV's vintage sitcom 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'National Lampoon's Animal House' in a sorority setting.Ultimately, strong performances, a persuasive cast, and a mild sedative of a saga make 'Girl Interrupted' worth watching once if not twice.",8,1,1,10 April 2008
Men in Black," A moderately entertaining, mega-budgeted, Far Side style, Sci-Fi Farce
","The idea for 'Men in Black,' the latest alien opus about cracking down on extraterrestrials hiding out on earth, conjures up a galaxy of surreal comic potential. If you're looking for a moderately entertaining, mega-budgeted, 'Far Side' farce that vapor locks just shy of 'Ghostbusters,' 'Men in Black' is your ticket. Even if this uneven outer limits comedy doesn't beam you up, its alleged million-dollar-per-minute special effects that infest the plot with a spawn of dorky aliens should impress you. Despite its abundant sight-gags and eye-popping aliens, 'Men in Black' frizzles because it relies on the familiar 'oxidize the earth' plot.'Men-In-Black' is a great looking movie hampered by a lame plot. Based on Lowell Cunningham's obscure but sensational Marvel comic from the early 1990s, the story sounds like 'Dragnet' meets 'Ghostbusters.' The subversive but inventive Ed Solomon script struggles to keep a deadpan lid on its diabolical lunacy so its gags will appear twice as funny. Basically, it's the old idea of getting more mileage out of a joke by telling it as if you weren't aware of the humor.The irreverent 'Men in Black' humor is so dry and sporadic that it sometimes fails to enthrall. You know you're watching a comedy, and you even laugh at what you see. After all, you know these guys are straining to be hilarious. But they're not funny enough all the time to make you forget they're struggling so hard to make you laugh. Solomon wastes too much time integrating Will Smith's character into the action and not enough time incorporating Linda Fiorentino's character. The story never generates any suspense, just a lot of pastel slime. The ending is outrageously implausible even by the wacky elastic standards of this fantasy.Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith impersonate a couple of laced-strait Federal agents who work for a ultra-hush, hush agency known only as INS Division 6. Headquartered out of sight in Manhattan, INS 6 licenses, monitors, and polices all alien activity on Earth. According to the movie, about fifteen-hundred aliens reside on the planet in a state of apolitical harmony. Any alien critter that goes AWOL gets busted by these INS 6 dudes.When we first meet J (Will Smith), he is a fleet-footed NYPD detective who's been close-encountered. INS 6 recruits him because he nearly caught the alien. (If Will Smith doesn't watch out, he is going to be type-cast as the John Wayne of alien butt kickers.) INS 6 Chief Zed (Rip Torn) teams J with veteran alien buster K (Tommy Lee Jones). Even if you can tolerate the long expository build up, the story suffers again because these characters never develop the camaraderie of the 'Ghostbusters.' After a UFO crashes into his pick-up truck, a creepy redneck farmer, Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), goes gunning for the aliens. They're a bunch of murderously mutant cockroaches. They zap Edgar instead and take control of his body. (This scene recalls the Stephen King episode in the 1982 movie 'Creepshow.') Edgar stumbles through the rest of the movie like a zombie. He's on a weird quest to kill two Arkillian aliens disguised as human and pinch a trinket hanging around a cat's neck that contains the galaxy. When he gets it, the Arkillian threat to atomize the planet unless our heroes can recover the bauble.What we don't learn about the aliens, the filmmakers are happy to show us. Aliens galore infest 'Men in Black.' They resemble mutants sprung from the island of Dr. Seuss. None are particularly threatening, but some are ugly and squid-like. The scene where J assists a mother alien in birth is pretty funny, but it doesn't match the impact of the Billy Crystal calf delivery in 'City Slickers.' Juveniles will drool over the flashy gadgets. One device called a 'neuralyzer' resembles a tire gauge crossed with a pin-light. Our heroes use it to erase the short term memory of any spectators that they encounter in the line of duty. Remember, we're not supposed to know that the aliens walk among us. Our heroes don their cool looking Ray Bans to dampen the effect on them. The Ray Bans are already available in stores, but you'll probably have to wait for the chrome plated guns. Judging from its opening weekend haul of $50 million plus dollars, 'Men in Black' should at least inspire a sequel as well as merchandising out the universe. There's a cartoon series already in the works.Director Barry Sonnenfeld pulls out all stops. The hokey dragon-fly in the opening scene sets the smart aleck tone for the movie. One of the best scenes is the jewelry store confrontation which the movie makers have already given up in the previews of 'Men in Black.' The witty use of tabloid newspapers to tell the real truth is ironic, and the real story behind the New York's World Fair is a hoot! Sonnenfeld keeps the light weight action moving at light speed. Sometimes the movie zips by so quickly they you have trouble keeping up with it. But 'Men in Black' lacks the bizarre finesse of Sonnenfeld's two 'Adams Family' movies. No complaints about the casting. Tom Lee Jones of 'The Fugitive' delivers the kind of stoic performance that would put Jack Webb to shame. Jones's grim-faced, buttoned-down expressions would be the envy of Detective Sergeant Friday. Jones proves himself a master comedian with impeccable timing again and again in 'Men in Black.' William Smith of 'Independence Day' blends his streetwise, Ebonic, home boy charm with the sartorial elegance of his character as an interesting contrast to Jones' tight-lipped stooge. These co-stars work well together, except that their cardboard characters never evolve in the two frantic days covered in the movie.'Men in Black' misfires more often than hits. You exit the movie theatre dazzled by the seamless special effects, but you may find that the dry, off-beat humor as memorable as a flash of light from a neutralizer.",7,0,0,15 September 2009
Elysium," Better Than 'District 9'
","Basically, writer & director Neill Blomkamp's futuristic 'Elysium' amounts to a 21st century version of the Fritz Lang sci-fi classic 'Metropolis.' Two kinds of people live in the dystopian future. The wealthy are the hopelessly wealthy, while the woebegone are the dirt-poor people. Everybody who is nobody, like poor Matt Damon's messianic protagonist who lives on Earth in Los Angeles in the year 2154, constitutes the woebegone. Max is a car thief on parole who toils in a factory where he gets zapped accidently by enough radiation to die in five days. Amazingly enough, the wealthy reside in outer space on an elite, gated community called Elysium which is strictly off-limits for everybody but the financially well-to-do. These affluent people live with everything at their disposable. They have a booth, not unlike a tanning bed, that they can crawl into that enables them to heal themselves no matter how desperate their condition. Indeed, a deceased villain is healed and restored to life in one of these miraculous pods. Blomkamp contends with serious contemporary social issues such as immigration, health care, and corruption in this quasi-escapism. The action scenes are undeniably exciting as well as suspenseful. Blomkamp has managed to make a thinking man science fiction movie where the commentary doesn't get in the way of our hero and his heroics. He strikes a deal with a Hispanic hacker on Earth, Spider (Wagner Moura of 'Narcos'), to commit the ultimate crime. Spider promises him that he will send him up to Elysium where Max can heal himself. First, they give him fake citizenship. Second, Max needs to download everything in an elite factory so Spider can destabilize the economy. Max must commit a form of rear lobotomy on a high-ranking factory officer, so Spider can acquire the codes. Meantime, treacherous Secretary Delacourt (a gruff Jodie Foster of 'The Beaver') is in cahoots with John Carlyle (William Fichtner of 'The Lone Ranger') who has designed safeguard system that prevents the thugs on Earth from breaching Elysium. Earlier, she had ordered the destruction of multiple shuttles that penetrated Elysium's air-space, which President Patel (Faran Tahir of 'Iron Man'), had reprimanded her about. As it turns out, Patel is Delacourt's sworn enemy and opponent in the government. Delacourt legitimized her orders that the shuttles be destroyed because she was protected the asylum of Elysium from outsiders. Sharlto Copley, who starred in 'District 9,' plays a sadomasochistic troubleshooter named Kruger who works for Dealcourt behind the scenes and revels in his bloodthirsty work. After Max and his minions ambush a shuttle heading for Elysium with Carlyle aboard, things get out of control. Copley really chews the scenery as the obnoxious antagonist. Earlier, Delacourt had been forced by a higher authority to deactivate Kruger, but now she requires his murderous talents. The information that resided in Carlyle's noggin has been downloaded into Max's skull. This ambitious sci-fi saga surpasses 'District 9.' The use of Spanish subtitles, since L.A. has degenerated into a place like the slums of Rio, helps audiences share in the third world atmosphere that Blomkamp wanted to generate. Critics have noted that 'Elysium' resembles not only the plot of an original 'Star Trek' episode 'The Cloud Minders,' and later they would compare it with 'Alita: Battle Angel.' The unfortunate part of this action-packed adventure is that our hero must die to save others. Ultimately, the ending seems too far-sighted.",10,1,7,25 August 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," The Jewish Version of 'The Godfather'
","Sergio Leone's most ambitious film took decades for the 'Fistful of Dollars' director to make, and he endured many struggles, not the least of which was the terrible re-editing of the film for American audiences. Leone's director's cut with flashbacks galore, told with a kind of surrealism that may be difficult for audiences to watch, develops the action. For example, the opening section of the film shows our hero hiding out in a Chinese opium den while a mysterious telephone rings for what seems forever before it is answered. The initial American cut took the film's complex narrative and reorganized events so that the story unfolded in chronological order. This flawed version ran 139 minutes and lacks the epic quality of the European cut. Whereas Leone's much longer version--clocking in at 229 minutes--jumped around and exhibited little fidelity to chronological order. Basically, the film charts the rise and fall of a quartet of Jewish gangsters who grew up in New York City and got involved in the liquor trade during Prohibition. These kids developed a way to salvage barrels of booze that had to be dumped into the East River when the law descended upon the bootleggers. David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro), Max Bercovicz (James Woods), Philip 'Cockeye' Stein (William Forsythe) and Patrick 'Patsy' Goldberg (James Hayden) rise to become major players in Prohibition. Sergio Leone wasn't interesting in simply making an urban version of 'Once Upon a Time In the West.' Indeed, he wanted to follow these characters across decades into the 1960s. Naturally, the film is beautiful, and the action adheres to the tropes of crime chronicles. Interestingly enough, the European cut opens with three gunmen--like those in 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'--searching for Noodles because they have a contract on him. Essentially, the film defies synopsis, but it is a work of art to watch, despite lots of nudity. Hardcore Leone fans will feast on this sprawling yarn with its elegantly orchestrated gunfights.",10,1,4,26 July 2018
Taken," 'Taken' is Good, But It's No 'Commando.'
","The new Liam Neeson kidnap thriller 'Taken' qualifies as both entertaining and predictable. Ostensibly, the message here is parents should think twice before they turn their fun-loving, 17-year old daughters loose in Paris, France, without an escort. 'District B-13' director Pierre Morel appropriates many of the clichés and conventions of kidnapping thrillers, but he ramps up the violence marginally for this PG-13 thriller while suspending any vestige of realism. The result is an exciting and suspenseful yarn about a 'Rambo' style father who takes names and kicks butt. Although it doesn't concern ransom demands, 'Taken' resembles the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger kidnap thriller 'Commando.' However, 'Taken' isn't half as good as the Schwarzenegger saga. Mind you, Neeson's sympathetic performance as a doting, never-say-die dad in pursuit of the evildoers who abducted his only daughter keeps things interesting. The villains in the formulaic screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen, who together wrote both 'The Transporter' and 'Kiss of the Dragon,' are as sleazy as maggots. The problem is no one single actor or character emerges who can match Neeson blow for blow. Big dumb action thrillers need a chief villain that we can genuinely loathe and that the hero can lock horns with in a struggle to the death. 'Taken' assembles too many trigger-happy miscreants that Neeson dispatches as easily as ten-pins in a bowling alley.'Taken' finds former CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson of 'Schindler's List') living in Los Angeles so he can be near his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace of TV's 'Lost') who lives with her mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen of 'GoldenEye'), and Stuart (Xander Berkeley of 'Air Force One')her affluent stepfather. Lenore and Bryan were divorced years ago because Bryan's job as a 'preventer' for Langley kept him from spending quality time not only with Kim but also her mother. Lenore has nothing but contempt for Bryan and does her best to keep him at arm's length from Kim. Indeed, Bryan lost his job with 'the Company' because he flew 9-thousand miles to celebrate Kim's birthday while he was on duty elsewhere in the world. Morel and his scenarists stress Bryan's deep love for his daughter. They show him pasting Kim's new photos into a scrapbook that contains pictures from each birthday. Bryan finds himself out-classed by Stuart at Kim's 17th birthday party when he gives her a karaoke player while Stuart gives her a horse. Kim still loves Bryan, but she is growing up and a girl has to do what a girl has to do, especially when her best friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy of 'Black Christmas') persuades her to fly with her to Paris to stay with her relatives. Before Kim can accompany Amanda, she has to get Bryan's written authorization, but our hero doesn't like the set-up. He worries about what could happen to them, even though Kim assures him that they will only be touring museums. Reluctantly, Bryan breaks down and signs the form, but he demands that Kim take an international cell phone with his number programmed into it.No sooner have the girls landed than Amanda gets the 'hots' for a Parisian pretty boy named Peter (Nicolas Giraud of 'Second Soufflé') who shares a taxi with them. In this respect, 'Taken' recalls the R-rated 'Hostel' where sexy girls lured lusty lads into a death trap in Eastern Europe. Peter invites them to a party, but the girls never make it. Peter phones a gang of grimy Albanians that operate a white slavery ring. In other words, they shanghai young girls, pump them full of narcotics, and force them into prostitution. Kim is on the phone with Bryan when the villains invade the apartment where Amanda's relatives live. Unfortunately, Amanda's relatives are gone on a vacation, too. Bryan coaches Kim about what to do even as the thugs come after her and drag her out from under a bed.Predictably, Lenore is distraught when she learns what has happened. Bryan's CIA buddies provide our hero with a wealth of information about the Albanians. They inform Bryan, however, that he has only 96 hours before he will lose Kim forever. Essentially, Kim will be sold to the highest bidder and be a sex slave until she dies. Bryan has Stuart arrange air passage for him to Paris, and our hero pulls out his black bag of tricks. Bryan contacts an old colleague with French intelligence, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin of 'The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc'), but he wants Bryan to leave the country. Bryan warns his old friend that he is prepared to tear down the Eiffel Tower to get his daughter back. Secretly, Jean-Claude assigns a team to shadow Bryan. Eventually, Bryan locates the Albanians and inflicts heavy losses on them, but cannot find Kim. Bryan manages to rescue a girl who may know of Kim's whereabouts. He helps her recover from the drugs that the villains have injected in her, and she gives Bryan a lead. Ten years ago Harrison Ford would probably have played Liam Neeson's part. Meanwhile, Neeson behaves believably enough to convince us that he is as a savvy as Matt Damon's Jason Bourne and can get into and out of the toughest predicaments imaginable. Bryan shoots, stabs, kills, fights, and tortures the treacherous Albanians until he gets what he wants. Indeed, Neeson resembles an indestructible Steven Seagal hero who can triumph over well-nigh impossible odds. Famke Janssen is relegated to the thankless role of the distraught mother, and Maggie Grace is hopelessly clueless as Kim. The Parisian locales look gritty enough, and our hero has his hands full the whole time, right up to the final gunfight on a sheik's yacht.Despite its paucity of realism and reliance on clichés, 'Taken' benefits from Neeson's stalwart performance and Morel's vigorous staging of the action that never loses its momentum throughout its nimble 93 minutes.",8,1,3,2 February 2009
Avatar," Voyage to the Planet of Smurf-Colored, Zulu-Tall Alien Warriors
","The highly touted and long anticipated 'Avatar' (*** out of ****) from writer & director James Cameron of 'Titanic' fame qualifies as a predictable but entertaining sci-fi culture clash between the aggressive, technology-driven human race and a primitive, agrarian-fueled alien society. Mankind has shipped in mind-boggling machinery to plunder the planet of a mineral called Unobtanium worth an astronomical fortune. The complication is an entire race of Smurf-colored, Zulu-tall, humanoid aliens called the Na'vi worships a gigantic tree rooted in the same soil as the priceless minerals.Basically, 'Avatar' pits tree-huggers against tree-haters. Indeed, the story is as venerable as any cavalry western about the white hero who joins a clueless Indian tribe living atop a hopelessly rich gold strike. Although he acts as a go-between, the hero betrays his own kind and sides with the Indians to preserve the land rather than let his own people rape it. Unfortunately, Cameron generates minimal emotion from this 'Dances with Wolves' melodrama. More problematic from the standpoint of credibility is the hybrid storyline. 'Avatar' alternates, albeit it smoothly, between a feature-length cartoon like 'FernGully: The Last Rainforest' and a Big Dumb 'Matrix' Action Movie stocked with stereotypes. Historically, 'Avatar' pays tribute to the legendary Pocahontas and Captain John Smith romance.'Avatar' takes place in the year 2145, on the distant planet of Pandora, after mankind has depleted all its natural resources on Earth. No, this has nothing to do with the terrible sci-fi thriller 'Pandorum' that starred Dennis Quaid. 'Avatar' and 'Pandorum' are two entirely separate sci-fi sagas. After his intellectually-gifted twin-brother is shot and killed by a mugger, Jack Scully--who is paralyzed from the waist down--is selected to replace him for a top-secret mission. A former Marine, Jake (Sam Worthington of 'Terminator: Salvation') is shipped off to distant Pandora to resolve tensions with the native Na'vi people so his fellow earthlings can excavate the Unobtanium. Jake sprawls out in a cylindral chamber and projects his consciousness into his flesh & blood avatar to control it. The avatar is a genetically bred replica of Pandora's indigenous Na'vi tribe. This avatar includes both human and Na'vi genetic material. Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang of 'Tombstone') commands the Earth project to extract the Unobtanium and he amounts to a one-dimensional 'Rambo' villain. Meaning, he won't be easy to kill. Stephen Lang makes a terrific villain who wants to see this peaceful but noble people destroyed. Colonel Quaritch considers biologist Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver of 'Aliens') a complete nuisance, but corporate representative Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi of 'The Mod Squad') lets Grace perform her diplomatic initiative to gain the trust and cooperation of the Na'vi. Secretly, Quaritch has cut a deal with Jake. If Jake can deliver the intelligence about the Na'vi that Quaritch needs, then he will have the medical gurus restore the use of Jake's legs. Meanwhile, Grace treats Jake with nothing but contempt. She refers to him as a 'Jarhead dropout.' Jake is separated from Grace and company during a helicopter ride into the jungle and he has to fend for himself in the wild. Neytiri nearly kills Jake when she encounters him first, but something happens that she has rarely seen in nature and she spares Jake his life.Meanwhile, the wise head of the Na'vi clan, Neytiri's father (Wesley Studi of 'Last of the Mohicans') orders her to train Jake, in his avatar form about their ways so they can better study him. Naturally, Jake falls in love with a maiden warrior princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana of 'Star Trek') and she introduces Jake to the jungle and its dangers. Neytiri seems more like an Environmentalist version of 'Mulan' and she is no slouch when she has to shoot arrows. Inevitably, as the conventions dictate, the heroine falls for the hero and they become inseparable. Along the way, Jake learns how to use his tail to ride a giant sky lizard and later an even bigger sky lizard.According to Hindu mythology, an avatar is a deity who takes human form and descended to earth. An avatar in computer parlance is an icon that a person adopts for use in virtual reality or cyberspace. In 'Avatar,' the avatar is a prefabricated body controlled by brain waves emitted by a human who functions as the body's driver. Cameron spends most of the first half-hour shoving exposition down our throats because he has to bring us up to speed on a brave new universe and its colorful but mysterious people. Of course, the special effects are awesome, but you need not see 'Avatar' in 3-D because it refrains from exploiting the technology the way most 3-D movies do. In other words, rarely does anything come flying out at you. The planet of Pandora with its floating mountains and luminous fauna is a treat for the eye. Pandora looks like an underwater planet without water, and the beasts that lurk in its lush jungle vaguely resemble our prehistoric dinosaurs.Nevertheless, despite its imposing 160-minute running time, Cameron maintains sufficient momentum to see things through to the kick-butt finale between good and evil. Some of the technology the avaricious earthlings import to the Pandora may remind you of the second 'Alien' movie, 'Aliens,' which was helmed by Cameron. Of course, 'Gamer' and 'Surrogates' beat Cameron to the punch with their stories about an avatar-oriented society. The visual spectacle and splendor of 'Avatar' with its floating mountains and its 'Black Hawk Down' aerial sequences will hold your attention. Again, the Zulu Smurfs with Submariner ears and 'Lion King' snouts never conjure up a tenth of the emotional charisma of a live-action character. In this respect, Cameron has embraced the performance capture technology espoused by Robert Zemeckis in his last three films. In other words, the sentiment is not sticky enough because they lack depth as characters.",8,3,10,20 December 2009
Toy Story 2," 'Toy Story 2' Is a Joy 2 Watch!
","'Toy Story 2' is twice as much fun as 'Toy Story.' Sequels seldom equal originals, but 'Toy Story 2' does with flying colors. Bad sequels stir the ashes, while good sequels ignite new fires.Advanced animation, exciting cliffhanger thrills, and inspired storytelling propel this plaything over its simple-minded but insightful predecessor. Not only does 'A Bug's Life' director John Lasseter and co-directors Ash Brannon and Lee UnKrich take 'Toy Story 2' out of Andy's house, but they also give girls a heroine of their own to cheer: cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack of 'High Fidelity').A greedy toy collector, Al McWhiggin (voiced by Wayne Knight), discovers Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) at a yard sale after our cowboy hero has rescued Wheezy, Andy's squeaky rubber toy penguin, from being sold. Andy's mom cannot part with Woody. Instead, she locks him up in her change box, but the obnoxious, balding, middle-aged, pot-bellied wholesaler breaks into it and steals Woody. Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) gathers the old gang: Slinky Dog (Jim Varney); Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm, the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger), and Rex, the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and they strike out to free Woody! They face new enemies and obstacles of the Indiana Jones variety. They cross a busy city street disguised as traffic cones and create widespread chaos.Meanwhile, trapped in Al's Toy Barn, Woody learns that he once starred in 'Woody's Round-Up, an imitation of 'Howdy Doody,' a once popular 1950s' kiddies' program on TV. Woody finds himself reunited with cowgirl Jessie, Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar), and a horse named 'Bullseye.' The show spun off a line of merchandise, such as Sheriff Woody dolls.McWhiggin has spent his entire life searching for Woody. Indeed, Woody is the missing link in an incomplete memorabilia set. Now, the villainous toy store owner can sell the whole shooting match for millions to a Japanese museum. Jessie, Stinky, and Bullseye are ecstatic about the prospect of immortality under glass in a museum. They have been stacked up in storage, a doll's equivalent to limbo, and they refuse to go back. Initially, Woody cottons to the idea of going to Japan. McWhiggin cleans him up and mends his broken arm. Woody found himself in this mess because Andy broke his arm accidentally during some rough horseplay before he shelved poor Woody. Locked on the horns of a dilemma, Woody weighs his love for Andy versus his quest for immortality.'Toy Story 2' emerges as a veritable 'Schindler's List' for animated characters. The rather philosophical plot ponders issues such as toy immortality and the fickle nature of a child's love. The worst thing you can say about 'Toy Story 2' is that it is merchandising with a melodrama. Thematically, in a poke at 'Pokemon,' 'Toy Story 2' argues that toys should be loved and played with instead of collected to gather dust on display. Altogether, 'Toy Story 2' qualifies as a hilarious treat for youngsters that adults can appreciate, too.",10,0,1,31 March 2008
Chariots of Fire," The Top Sports Film of the 1980s
","Hugh Hudson's 'Chariots of Fire' ranks as the inspirational sports film of the 1980s. Ironically, this Oscar winning epic literally came out of nowhere, according to its director, with its line-up of freshman actors and its small $5-million budget. On the DVD commentary track, Hudson states that the theme of the film is faith. This biographical opus about the 1924 Paris Olympics and the British running team that captured several Medals focuses largely on Scotsman Eric Liddell and Jewish Harold Abrahams as they tangle with intolerance all the way to the top. Ben Cross is terrific as the strident Abrahams and the film opens with a memorial service to him in an English church. Although Eric Liddel did not face the prejudice that Abrahams had to endure, he created problems with his decision to keep the Sabbath and refuse to run the 100 meters heat on a Sunday. Liddell is a Christian missionary at Cambridge and he has trouble with his naïve sister Jeanie who wants him to forsake running for his service to God and often scolds him for letting his desire to run interfere with the Lord's business. Finally, Eric has to explain to his dutiful sister that he cannot hold in contempt what God has given him. 'Chariots of Fire' is all about champions and the price that they are willing to pay to be triumphant in the end. Brad Davis of 'The Midnight Express' and Dennis Christopher of 'Breaking Away' co-star along with the impressive Nigel Davenport. You will never forget Vangelis' memorable Oscar-winning musical score.",Null,1,1,28 September 2011
Drag Me to Hell," Cannot Compare with Raimi's Incomparable 'Evil Dead' Trilogy!
","'Evil Dead' trilogy director Sam Raimi returns to his roots with this relatively lightweight chiller 'Drag Me to Hell,' but it generates nowhere as many chills as his 'Evil Dead' epics with Bruce Campbell. Indeed, 'Drag Me to Hell' ranks several rungs below Raimi's reputation.A twentysomething bank loan officer Christine Brown (cute little Alison Lohman of 'Flicka') struggles to convince her immediate superior Mr. Jacks(David Paymer of 'Mumford') that she is the best candidate for the as yet filled assistant loan manager's position. Mr. Jacks reminds Christine that the individual that he selects for the job has to be able to make difficult decisions. Meanwhile, Christine faces stiff competition from an Asian-American, Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee of 'Tropic Thunder')who will stoop to any low tactic to get the job himself. For example, Stu gives Mr. Jacks a couple of tickets to a Los Angeles Lakers' basketball game. A ghastly-looking hag of Gypsy woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver of 'Freeway'),shows up to get a third extension on her mortgage since she has been sick. Ganush is so hopelessly repulsive that you almost find yourself laughing at her when she pulls out her Halloween-looking dentures. In an effort to impress Mr. Jacks, Christine displays her complete lack of compassion for this revolting looking crone and turns her down. The hideous old Gypsy woman curses our heroine and Christine's life becomes a living Hell. Flies climb her nose and the old woman haunts her.Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi penned the screenplay, but there isn't really anything new here. In fact, 'Drag Me to Hell' reminded me of the Stephen King chiller 'Thinner' (1996)where a guy hits an old Gypsy woman with his car and finds himself cursed. Poor Christine cannot sleep with experiencing nightmares and a horned goat-like phantom stalks her at his house. Meanwhile, Christine's sympathetic boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long of 'Live Free or Die Hard') has trouble trying to figure what has turned his girlfriend into a delusional maniac. Desperate to rid herself of the Gypsy woman's curse, Christine visits a medium. No sooner has a storefront psychic, Rham Jas (newcome Dileep Rau), cradled our heroine's hands in his hands than he realizes that he is out of his element. Ostensibly, 'Drag Me to Hell' qualifies as your basic morality horror movie with a couple of surprises, but it remains flatly predictable right to its hellacious ending. Christine gets what she deserves in the last scene. Justin Long does a good job as Christine's long-suffering boyfriend, while Lorna Raver is terrific as the Gyspy woman. The first half of this chiller surpasses the last half. The key to everything in this occasionally frightening fare is a button from Christine's couat. Raimi relies on standard horror practices to turn your skin into goosebumps. People jump out of places that you never expected them to and the sound effects are ramped up loudly enough to make you jump. Interestingly, Raimi opens this minor league chiller with the old 1950's Universal Studios logo instead of the new one. 'Drag Me to Hell' doesn't have enough hell and contains too much drag.",6,1,4,8 June 2009
Selma," Good But Flawed
","Audiences that don't know a lot about Civil Rights history during the turbulent 1960s may have trouble appreciating 'Selma,' with David Oyelowo as Baptist minister and social activist Reverend Martin Luther King. 'Middle of Nowhere' director Ava DuVernay's evocative historical drama about Dr. King's protest march in that same Alabama town benefits chiefly from first-rate performances, a gifted cast, and some devastating scenes about the reprisals that African-Americans and white faced in the struggle for African-American voting rights equality. Nevertheless, as good as it is, 'Selma' is not without blemishes. This loquacious, often artistically uneven melodrama suffers from slow pacing and inaccurate history. Unfortunately, DuVernay and freshman scenarist Paul Webb have tampered with history to make their points. Primarily, 'Selma' pits Martin Luther King against U.S. President Lyndon Johnson in several Oval Office confrontations, and many historians have taken the filmmakers to task for this ham-fisted blunder. Andrew Young, one of Dr. King's chief advisors during those fateful days, has gone on record about the relationship that existed between MLK and LBJ. In Young's own words, 'He (LBJ) and Martin never had that kind of confrontation.' Undeniably, 'Selma' qualifies as a significant motion picture largely because Martin Luther King dominates the action. British actor David Oyelowo delivers a sterling performance as King that depicts his dedication to and compassion for equal rights for African Americans. Previously, most Civil Rights era films have confined King to the periphery, among them Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X,' Richard Pearce's 'The Long Walk Home,' and Richard LaGravenese's 'Freedom Riders.' The three-part, television miniseries 'King' (1978) has been the only biography with any substance about the slain Civil Rights leader. Although Oyelowo carries the weight of the film on his shoulders, several other performances cannot be ignored, including Tom Wilkinson's earthy portrayal of Johnson, Carmen Ejogo as King's long-suffering wife Coretta Scott King, and Oprah Winfrey as tenacious voting rights protester Annie Cooper who refused to give up in her efforts to register so she could vote. Ultimately, the thing that makes 'Selma' a memorable is the history that it painstakingly recreates at some of the actual settings, particular the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Despite its flaws and its largely conventional approach, 'Selma' deserves to be seen because it chronicles how far America came in race relations during the 1960s and also how much farther we as a country must go to maintain equality.My chief complaint about 'Selma' is the filmmakers' casual regard about the use of history. Scenarist Paul Webb and director Ava DuVernay must have believed that audiences had an adequate knowledge about the Civil Rights movement. After the film opens with Dr. King receiving the Nobel Peace award, 'Selma' takes a moment to show the explosion that claimed the lives of four adolescent African American girls at the 16th Street Birmingham Church in 1963. We're told little about this tragic incident before Webb and DuVernay plunge us into King's first strategy session with his lieutenants about a suitable place to launch their next protest. King wants to know if Selma Sheriff Jim Clark (Stan Houston of 'Devil's Knot') behaves more like Birmingham Police Chief Bull Connor or Albany, Georgia, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett. You have to know something about King's unsuccessful Albany protest to understand why they talk about Pritchett. Police Chief Pritchett and his deputies did not resort to the same kind of brutal violence that Birmingham Police Chief Bull Connor wielded when he turned loose snarling dogs on African Americans and flattened them with blasts of water from fire hoses. Because Pritchett did not rely on violence, Dr. King's Albany protest generated little media coverage. Interestingly enough, at one point, King even put the protest movement on hold so Pritchett could take time off to celebrate a wedding anniversary with his wife! Meantime, the struggles African Americans contended with in Selma are shown in vivid detail. Initially, Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey of 'The Butler') tried to register at the Selma court house, but the obnoxious Registrar (Clay Chappell of 'Footloose') thwarted her at every turn. Later, after Dr. King and his lieutenants arrived in town, they discussed the ways that white officials intimidated African Americans from registering to vote. Poll taxes, civics tests, the requirement that an actual voter vouch for them, and lastly the publishing of one's name and address in the newspaper if one managed to register were used routinely to discourage African Americans from registering. Getting one's name in the newspaper served as an open invitation to either losing one's job or being beaten up, shot at, and/or fire-bombed. The first Selma march that occurred while Dr. King was absent qualifies as the most frightening. Sheriff Clark's deputies waded into the marchers and attacked them with clubs lashed with barbed wire, and they beat the living daylights out of anybody. Earlier, when Annie Lee Cooper assaulted the pot-bellied Clark at the court house, white lawmen had piled ont0 her without restraint, and they arrested anybody who had participated in the protest. The most tragic moments occurred during a night march when Dr. King was absent again and Alabama State Troopers murdered a young African American. Unfortunately, all too often, 'Selma' degenerates into great men arguing in rooms. Dr. King and his advisors argue; Dr. King and LBJ argue, and LBJ and segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace argue. Although scenarist Paul Webb and director Ava DuVernay present Dr. King as a fully rounded individual, they make LBJ and Wallace look like caricatures. Most of 'Selma' details the strategy Dr. King and his adversaries adopted during their crusade. Only when DuVernay stages physical scenes without chatter does she hammer home her salient points. Eventually, African Americans triumphed because they recruited liberal white supporters. The scene where racist rednecks assault a white Boston priest and beat him to death is chilling. As a stirring historical drama about our controversial past, 'Selma' is a must-see movie, particularly if you know little about Martin Luther King.",8,1,3,22 January 2015
The Artist," Trite, Tiresome, and Interminable
","Don't get me wrong. I love silent movies. I teach film history classes and use silent movies. Everybody should watch at least ten silent films in their lives. Nevertheless, watching Best Picture winner 'The Artist' left me feeling genuinely underwhelming. This imaginative homage to silent era cinema when actions spoke louder than words qualifies as trite, tiresome, and interminable. Talented 'O.S.S. 117' director Michel Hazanavicius has written and helmed a movie about the changing technology in Hollywood on the eve of the Wall Street collapse and the Great Depression. He has forged a debonair matinée idol hero named George Valentin (Jean Dujardin of 'Lucky Luke') who emerges as a synthesis of Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino, and Charles Chaplin. George works at the Kinograph Studios where he is the top draw. The hero gives a new girl, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo of 'A Knight's Tale'),a break at movie premiere during a incident that the press capture. Eventually, Peppy becomes a big star. She ascends to stardom in talkie pictures. Valentin tries to buck the trend like Charles Chaplin did, but he doesn't fare as successfully at Chaplin. Chaplin made two more silent movies after silent movies saturated the market. Valentin makes 'Tears of Love,' but this adventure film flops at the box office. He becomes box office poison, while Peppy becomes a stellar attraction. Eventually, the matinée hero slips into a malaise. He has to sell everything, but he doesn't have his heart in living. He fires the only friend that he has ever had, his chauffeur, Clifton, and sends him packing. The co-star of his 'Tin Tin' like movies, a spunky Jack Russell terrier, remains faithful to him even when he wraps his lips around the barrel of a revolver. He cannot commit suicide, but at this point, you almost wish that he would. The chief problem with 'The Artist' is that the plot is thinner than a strip of celluloid, while the characters are only slightly advanced. The lethargy sets in during the hero's bout with depression. Happily, despite its indebtedness to 'A Star Is Born,' everything ends favorably at fadeout, but it is really no surprise. Worse, writer & director Hazanavicius stretches things out far too long. Clocking in at 100 minutes, 'The Artist' is about 20 minutes too long and the characters lack charisma. The twist of fate that saves Valentin and assures comeback is too contrived to be entirely satisfactory. Nonetheless, I've got to tip my critical hat to the Academy for trying to buck the trend. No, I don't think 'The Artist' deserved any of its Oscars, but it isn't an entirely awful movie. Hazanavicius deserves praise for trying something different, but the difference here doesn't make the difference. Bernard Herrmann's love theme from the Alfred Hitchcock movie 'Vertigo' adds nothing spectacular, just serves to make thing even more dreary. The production values are solid and the performances are acceptable.",4,3,9,12 March 2012
Invictus," Sentimental But Never Sappy Sports Saga
","Morgan Freeman has so much talent that he makes acting look easy. In director Clint Eastwood's latest movie 'Invictus,' based on John Carlin's non-fiction book 'Playing the Enemy,' Freeman impersonates controversial South African President Nelson Mandela. Interestingly, Mandela said that Freeman was the only actor who he felt could do him justice on the big-screen. Basically, this inspirational sports saga about rugby concerns more than just capturing the 1995 World Cup. 'Sherlock Holmes' scenarist Anthony Peckham and Eastwood have produced a solemn, straightforward, but contemplative film about how Mandela shrewdly appropriated a hated symbol of apartheid and wielded it so that he could unite a racially torn nation. In other words, the savvy politician pulled the ultimate public relations ploy and used a rugby team. This factual social activist melodrama with its liberal perspective seems rather predictable at times, but it is remains nevertheless as reassuring as it is absorbing. Essentially, two minds meet in 'Invictus' and forge a change that solidified a country. The performances by Morgan Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as a conscientious rugby coach are flawless. Damon appears physically fit for such a demanding role and his accent sounds reasonable. Some scenes seem almost too good to be true, particularly the camaraderie between a young black teen and two gruff-looking South African beat cops during the World Cup game. Unlike most sports films, 'Invictus' dwells more on how the game of rugby engineered racial harmony in a repressive society than about the game itself.After 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman of 'Unforgiven') emerges and wins the presidency of South Africa. Mandela's victory ushered in many striking changes, and his fellow blacks wanted to disband the South African team, the Springboks, because it reminded them of racial oppression. No sooner does Mandela hear about this rash decision than he races out to appeal to his constituents about the error of their ways. Of course, they hate the Springboks, but Mandela urges them to support him and his request to leave the Springboks alone. Mandela convinces them that this represents a splendid opportunity to allay white fears about black power. Initially, Mandela's closest adviser warns him about this kind of activism. Meanwhile, the Springboks are doing themselves no favors with their abysmal performance on the playing fields. A Mandela adviser observes that winning the World Cup would create a lot of ppsitive publicity for the new government and Mandela summons blond Afrikaner, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon of 'The Bourne Ultimatum') who bears no political crosses, and encourage him to win the World Cup. The messiah-like Mandela exerts considerable influence on Pienaar and the coach takes his pampered team on promotional tours into the most squalid of black ghettos to teach the children the basics of the game. Early in 'Invictus,' one of Mandela's white bodyguards describes to his black cohorts the essentials of rugby: 'Soccer is a gentleman's game played by hooligans, rugby is a hooligan's game played by gentlemen.' When Peckham and Eastwood aren't concentrating on Mandela's cagey political maneuvers, they depict the changes that occurred all over South Africa with a subplot about the president's integrated team of bodyguards. Mandela's chief of security had requested more bodyguards, so the president obliges him with British-trained, Afrikaner cops. Indeed, Mandela discourages any whites from leaving government service because he needs them as examples of unity within his administration. Time gradually erodes white anxieties about black aspirations as reflected by grudging cooperation between the black and white bodyguards. Again, rugby takes center stage with the whites explaining the rules of rugby to their colleagues.Nelson Mandela comes off looking as slippery as James Stewart in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Mandela doesn't miss a trick in his political calculations and he impresses his closest adviser. Indeed, Mandela emerges in 'Invictus' as an Abraham Lincoln of sorts. He survived 24 years of brutal, back-breaking imprisonment on an island and slept on a mat for a bed. This same individual, who endured enormous hardship, later ascended from the lowest position in society—a prison inmate—and attained the highest post—president of the same country that had incarnated him. Mandela realized from his pinnacle of power that the only way to thwart an immanent civil war that threatened to tear South Africa apart that he had to exercise accommodation toward his fellow whites.Wisely, director Clint Eastwood doesn't have much truck with politics in 'Invictus.' Peckham and he provide the basic ground work about the sudden changes that rocked South Africa with Mandela's election as president. They present us with the struggles that the Springbox with their green and gold outfits endure. Mandela demonstrates true insight into his fellow men when he decides to let a predominantly white rugby team become a rallying cry for intolerance and unity. No, 'Invictus' is not the kind of movie that you would expect from Clint Eastwood and—like his protagonist who prefers to make risks—Eastwood has helmed and honed another classic. 'Invictus' ranks as a sentimental sports saga that never gets sappy. Incidentally, 'Invictus' translated means invincible.",9,5,9,14 December 2009
Mission: Impossible," Exciting But Nothing Like the TV Series
","The transition that 'Mission Impossible' made from the small screen to the big screen ignited considerable controversy. The beloved character that Peter Graves originated on television named Jim Phelps became a treacherous rogue agent that Jon Voight played as a villain in the film that director Brian De Palma helmed. Hardcore 'Mission Impossible' fans have never forgiven either Tom Cruise or Brian De Palma for this sacrilege. The first 'Mission Impossible' suffers from contrivances galore. Nevertheless, 'Mission Impossible' emerges as an exciting, suspenseful nail-biter with three electrifying set-pieces: the opening computer heist debacle at an American embassy, the white-knuckled scene in the vault at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and the chilling train ride sequence as the finale that culminates with a helicopter being dragged by a train through the claustrophobic confines of a tunnel. The CIA vault scene ends up being the best, with the other two are slickly done. The story opens with a brief vignette that features American espionage agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise of 'Risky Business') masquerading as an older, mustached man orchestrating a ruse against an enemy agent by convincing his adversary that he has been instrumental in the death of a young woman. As soon as Hunt extracts the information from his disheveled adversary, they incapacitate him, revive the girl, Claire (Emmanuelle Béart of 'Don Juan'), who is playing possum and tear down the fake motel. The next thing we know we are introduced to the cinematic incarnation of Jim Phelps, and 'Mission Impossible' adheres slavishly to the television formula with IMF chief Phelps receiving the usual briefing from a disc that self-destructs after he is told about his latest mission should he decide to accept it. Phelps relies on his right hand man, Ethan Hunt, to coordinate the operation in Prague. The IMF is supposed to record the pilfering of the CIA's master list of Eastern Europe spies. During the mission, everything goes haywire, and everybody but Hunt dies. Ultimately, we learn that neither Phelps nor his wife Claire died. The Phelps couple staged their own deaths. Naturally, since Hunt is the last man standing, his CIA superior Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny of 'Ice Castles') suspects that he may culpable of the crime. The big revelation for Hunt is the discovery that the entire operation was 'a mole hunt' to expose a saboteur. The resourceful Hunt manages to escape from Kittridge when he uses explosive chewing gum to blow up the aquarium restaurant where he met with the CIA chieftain.Holing up in a Prague safe house, Hunt finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Eventually, he smokes out an arms dealer, Max (Vanessa Redgrave of 'Blow-Up') who pays him to steal the spy list. Since he cannot call on his former comrades because they are dead, Hunt enticed disavowed computer specialist Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of 'Pulp Fiction') and pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno of ''Flyboys') who can fly a helicopter through anything. The theft of top-secret computer documents from Langley ranks as the best scene in 'Mission Impossible' with our intrepid hero dangling from a rig in the ceiling to make himself inconspicuous to the vault security gauntlet. Watching Krieger as he uses his muscles to keep Hunt from tripping the security alarms is taut stuff. The exit that they make disguised as firefighters is clever. Like its small screen predecessor, the cinematic 'Mission' features spectacles that boast built-in TV cameras, hidden microphones, laptop computers, agents in sophisticated covers, exploding cars, exploding chewing gum, stabbings, gunplay, bodies toppling into a river, etc.",8,2,2,4 August 2015
Saw," See 'Saw' and ride a teeter-totter of terror!
","Hardcore horror film fanatics measure their fright flicks by how far filmmakers push the envelope in their efforts to scare audiences. Meaning, what do the filmmakers do that that none have ever dared do in a horror picture? Do they pile on more blood and guts? Do they take horrific conventions (i.e. monsters or ways to die) to greater extremes of sadism? Do they offer more stomach-churning plot twists? Freshman director James Wan doesn't push the envelope with his movie 'Saw,' he shoves the envelope straight up our collective sinuses. Imagine the murderous 1997 movie 'Cube' crossed with elements of the grisly, white- knuckled, Brad Pitt serial killer saga 'Se7en' and nasty bits and pieces from Italian gore- master Dario Argento's nail-biters 'Deep Red' (1975) and 'Suspiria' (1977), and you have a glimmer of an idea what you'll get from 'Saw.' Basically, Wan and writer/actor Leigh Whannel put the teeth back into terror with their ingenious, ironic, R-rated, masochistic thriller killer movie. This stark, visceral, mean-spirited, George Romeo-style gorefest isn't for folks who cannot handle Grand Guignol horror movies. Whether it's the eerie puppet head that intimidates the killer's victims or a psychotic character who decides he would rather cut off his own leg with a hacksaw to free himself from being shackled to a pipe, 'Saw' succeeds in keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout its 100 nerve-wrenching minutes.'Saw' opens as its two shanghaied protagonists, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes of 'Robin Hood: Men In Tights') and a low-life photographer Adam (newcomer Leigh Whannel), awaken to find themselves chained at the ankles to huge pipes in the most foul-smelling and disgusting men's restroom this side of Iraq. Topping off everything, sprawled in the middle of the grimy floor between them, face down on the tiles in a huge puddle of dried blood, lies a dead man gripping a micro cassette recorder in one fist and a revolver in the other hand who appears to have shot himself in the head. Essentially, manacled as they are at the ankles across the room from each other, Gordon and Adam constitute a hybrid version of the 1958 Tony Curtis/Sidney Poitier civil rights yarn 'The Defiant Ones.' Since they aren't going anywhere, they try to deduce how they wound up in the worst place in the world. They discover that each has a micro cassette in their possession. After they manage to get the micro cassette player out of the corpse's hand and play their tapes, they learn that Dr. Gordon has until 6 PM to kill Adam (several hours from then) or they both die without a hope of anybody finding them. Wan and Whannel keep things short, shocking, and savage. 'Saw' is the kind of movie where the characters don't get second chances to live. Further, you'll have to be psychic to figure out who the killer is. Watch out for those red herrings! Nobody is really who they seem to be in 'Saw.' Ironically, the maniacal villain--referred to as 'the Jigsaw killer'--puts his victims in situations where they end up killing themselves or others in the process of trying to save themselves. Fans of the Ted Danson TV-sit com 'Becker' will appreciate Shawnee Smith's acting range. In a brief role, she played a 'Double Jeopardy' like heroine who escapes death, but bring eternal turmoil on herself. The Jigsaw killer placed her male roommate and her in a room. She has a huge steel bear-trap slung around her head like a helmet with a key lock. The killer reveals that when the timer spots, the bear-trap will implode and crush her skull, unless she can get the key inside the entrails of her dead roomie. Although she survives the ordeal, she learns afterward that her roommate was drugged, not dead, and she killed him when she eviscerated him in her search for the key. A subplot about a revenge-seeking, ex-cop (Danny Glover of 'Lethal Weapon') who wants to kill the Jigsaw killer for killing his Asian partner alternates with the flashbacks about how our protagonists got to where they are, and the suspense mounts as to whether the ex-cop will rescue the victims before they have to kill each other. 'Saw' is the kind of horror movie that appeals to your baser instincts by showing you things you won't easily forget when you go to sleep. See 'Saw' and ride a teeter-totter of terror!",9,0,1,9 July 2007
Sinister," 'Sinister' Will Make U Scream!
","'Sinister' qualifies as both spooky as well as scary. This clearly superior but derivative haunted house chiller lives up to its atmospheric title. Merriam-Webster defines the adjective 'sinister' as 'singularly evil or productive of evil.' Furthermore, the dictionary adds 'sinister' portends either misfortune or tragedy. Not surprisingly, 'Sinister' wallows in misfortune and tragedy. Alas, too many horror pictures promise more blood, sweat, and screams than they deliver with similar titular adjectives. Fortunately, 'Sinister' serves as the exception to this cliché. Writer/director Scott Derrickson and rookie writer C. Robert Cargill have conjured up a genuinely spine-chilling spectacle with found footage that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of its 109 minutes. You might anticipate some of the scares, but you won't be prepared for the cacophony of sound effects that accompanies each and is calculated to make lesser souls shriek. Squeamish film goers would do well to shun 'Sinister.' Derrickson has staged four disturbing scenes that unfold individually as smaller films within the film. Actually, these scenes constitute little more than snuff movies. Strictly based on these unsavory moments, 'Sinister' amounts to far more than just sinister. Sick might be a more appropriate adjective.Oscar-nominated Ethan Hawke of 'Training Day' toplines this enigmatic, bump-in-the-night nail biter with a sure-footed supporting cast that features Fred Dalton Thompson and Vincent D'Onofrio. Ostensibly, the plot concerns a bestselling true-crime author determined to duplicate an earlier literary success. Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) hasn't written a bestseller in about a decade, but he believes he has found the right stuff to write about in a sleepy Pennsylvania town. Four macabre murders where three family members perished in cold blood while an adolescent was abducted obsess this down-on-his-luck writer. Oswalt assures his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance of 'Animal'), that this project could be the equivalent of what 'In Cold Blood' was for Truman Capote. The County Sheriff (Fred Dalton Thompson of 'Die Hard 2') wants nothing to do with Oswalt. He abhors the way the author has treated law enforcement in his tomes. Meantime, one of his deputies (James Ransone of 'Inside Man') eagerly wants to help Oswalt so the author will acknowledge his contribution in print.Strange things begin to occur not long after Oswalt and his family move into their new house. Nothing about the house looks ominous. Oswalt discovers a box of Super 8 films with a projector hidden in the attic. He watches these gruesome little films and starts hitting the bottle. Oswalt's son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario of 'People Like Us') has relapses of nightmares or what his parents refer to as 'night terrors' that they thought he had out-grown. Trevor learns about the murders and paints a picture of them at his new school. Naturally, Tracy isn't happy about this incident. Later, while he is prowling around in the attic, Oswalt crashes through the ceiling and injures his leg. Eventually, he breaks down and informs long suffering Tracy that they are living in the same house where the previous family was hanged from a tree in the backyard and their daughter disappeared without a trace. Tracy becomes hysterical and demands that they leave. Now, Oswalt begins to have second thoughts, especially when he finds extended cuts of the very same films that he incinerated. They cannot pack up soon enough to get out of town. Nevertheless, trouble follows them.Along the way, Derrickson and Cargill conjure up a devilish ghoul named Bughuul. This elusive demon behaves like Freddy Kruger with his razor-blade-tipped fingers, and Bughuul (stunt man Nicolas King of 'The Green Hornet') lurks on the periphery of the murders in each small film. Somehow, Bughuul can migrate between the real world and the cinematic world without any problems and wreck havoc. The filmmakers give him a face that resembles the creepy doll in the 'Saw' film franchise. Apparently, Bughuul—otherwise known by the kids as Mr. Boogie—exerts a hypnotic influence over children and can convince them do his bidding. If Derrickson and Cargill play their cards correctly, they could parlay a franchise out of this frightening film that combines elements of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' with Jack Nicholson and the snuff saga '8MM' with Nicolas Cage. Homages to classics such as 'Blow-Up,' 'Manhunter,' 'Saw,' 'Jeepers Creepers,' show up. 'Indisputably, 'Sinister' ranks as Derrickson at the top of his game after previous outing such as the tedious 'Exorcism of Emily Rose' and the anemic remake 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.' Derrickson manages to make even ordinary action, like threading up a film projector, appear suspenseful. Unfortunately, despite its marvelously menacing aura, 'Sinister' keeps Mr. Boogie confined to the periphery so Oswalt and he never have a face-to-face confrontation.",8,1,4,16 October 2012
Up," Fly Away House!
","The Pixar animated comedy 'Up' owes no small amount of its success to the specter of Charles Chaplin. No, Chaplin had nothing to do with this fanciful, first-rate, odd-couple comedy, except that 'Up' shares something in common with Chaplin's 1921 movie 'The Kid.' The story throws together a grumpy 78 year old retiree and an eight-year old Wilderness Explorer scout and the elder learns how important he is to youngster after his wife has died. This exciting 3-D adventure (it's also available in 2-D) boasts top-flight production values. Indeed, this represents an instance where the characters are so realistically done and voiced that you readily accept them for the people that they play in the film. Mind you, this release may appear to be geared primarily toward adolescents, but adults don't have to worry about getting the short-shrift. There is more depth here beyond the superb 3-D visual effects than you might imagine. Although 'Monsters, Inc.' director Peter Doctor and scenarist Bob Peterson have made a film that epitomizes the spirit of adventure, 'Up' is not without its poignant heartfelt moments that older viewers will appreciate but younger ones will dismiss. The protagonist, former balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner's voice), is a septuagenarian who's hasn't entirely gotten over the death of his beloved wife Ellie. Ellie and he met when they were adolescents themselves and shared the spirit of adventure embodied in their media icon, the dauntless explorer and aviator Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer's voice) who flies around in his dirigible like an airborne Jacques Cousteau and makes headlines with each of his exploits. Carl likes to dress up like his idol when he attends the movies and watches the newsreels about Muntz. Unfortunately, Muntz's latest expedition falls under a cloud of suspicion because the fossils that he has brought back are disputed by the experts and he is officially discredited. Thwarted in his ambitions, the irate Muntz retreats from public view and he resolves to prove that he was right and his critics wrong. Indeed, there is a little of Captain Nemo in Muntz who flies around in his dirigible. Meanwhile, Carl comes home from the movies with his balloon and runs into Ellie in a dilapidated two-story house that she has equipped as if it were a plane. She freaks out Carl so much that he cannot utter a word when they meet and he realizes that she is a tomboy girl. They become inseparable best friends. They grow up and marry. They refurbish the old house and Carl gets a job selling balloons. The happiness that they share is derailed when Ellie realizes that she cannot have a child, but they continue to live their lives through their hero, Charles Muntz, and plan to visit the site of his last expedition that ended in his discredit. Unfortunately, Ellie dies the day that Carl buys their tickets. Now, alone in his golden years, Carl finds himself surrounded by new construction projects rising around him and men-in-suits trying to buy him out. Alas, Carl cannot sell the house that was so much a part of his life with Ellie. Things take another turn for the worse for Carl. A construction worker rams the mail box that Ellie and Carl built and Carl assaults the man with his walking cane and draws blood. The courts rule against him and Carl appears bound for the last place he wants to go: a retirement village. Along about that time, Carl has to deal with a cheerfully obtuse Wilderness Scout, Russell, who needs to earn a badge helping old folks. Initially, Carl wants nothing to do with Russell.The day that the attendants from the retirement village show up to take Carl away, they notice piles of helium containers piled up on his lawn. Carl inflates the balloons and he flies away in his house to South America where Ellie and he dreamed about visiting the site of Muntz's last expedition. No sooner has Carl gotten his house aloft than he hears a knock at his front door and Russell is standing anxiously on the porch dying to come inside. Eventually, the oldster and the younger grow to tolerate and then love each other. They reach the site of Muntz's expedition. Sherlock Holmes readers who read A. Conan Doyle's novel 'The Lost World' will recognize the similarity between the terrain of the plateau. Once they arrive, our heroes discover an example of a the wild life, a prehistoric bird, that befriends them. Unfortunately, Muntz wants to capture this bird so that he can rehabilitate his career. Inevitably, Carl and Russell find themselves pitted against the evil Muntz and his legion of oddball canines that wear exotic dog collars which enable them to speak. Talk about underdogs, our heroes have a rough time saving the extinct bird from Muntz who is quite a dastard in his own right. The logic behind this story is clearly at odds with reality, but the sympathetic heroes and dastardly villain help us take our mind of these flaws. Carl was obviously forged in the Chaplin mode, but he resembles a cross between of Cary Grant from 'Walk, Don't Run' and Spencer Tracy from 'Guess Whose Coming to Dinner.' 'Up' is a lot of fun and you won't want to come down after its happy ending.",10,0,3,25 July 2009
The Hurricane," Watch This Terrifice Story of Criminal Injustice
","'The Hurricane' qualifies as Denzel Washington's best movie since Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X.' Truth is stranger than fiction, and 'In the Heat of the Night' director Norman Jewison's 'The Hurricane' proves it. Although Hollywood has tampered with the facts about Rubin Carter and his stormy relationship with the racist New Jersey criminal justice system, this knock-out 'Rocky' meets 'Les Miserables' biography about a erroneously imprisoned pugilist sticks closely to the truth. For example, nine Canadian hippies instead of three unearthed the evidence that ultimately freed Carter. Moreover, the Canadiansportrayed like the cavalry riding to the rescueresemble Bob Vila's elves rather than commune members! As a reckless youth, Rubin Carter attracted trouble like a magnet in a steelyard. Arrested as a juvenile for stabling a prominent white businessman thatCarter claimstried to molest one of his friends, Rubin comes under the constant scrutiny of racist Detective Sergeant Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya of 'Tightrope'). Della Pesca devotes his career to railroading Carter. Later, Carter escapes from reform school and enlists in the U.S. Army, where he becomes a paratrooper and a middleweight boxer. No sooner has he returned home from the Army than Della Pesca arrests him again, and Carter has to serve out his reform school sentence.Della Pesca hates Carter so much that when the latter achieves fame as a middleweight boxer, Della Pesca frames him for a triple homicide in a bar. Furthermore, he bribes two burglars that witnessed the crime to commit to testify that Carter committed the killings! Later, the burglars recanted their false testimony. While Carter won a retrial, the courts upheld his original conviction. Celebrities championed his case, but Carter languished in prison for 19 years. During that soul-eroding time, Carter penned his autobiography 'The 16th Round.' Years later at a used book sale, a black teenager, Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon of 'Hart's War'), found the book. Martin was a Brooklyn native living in Canada with members of a commune that had adopted him to tutor him for his college entrance exams. Carter's book touched Lesra, and he visited Carter in prison. They became close friends and pen pals. Eventually, Lesra's guardians began to smell a rat in the injustice dealt Carter. They moved from Canada and promised Carter that they wouldn't quit until he was exonerated.Oscar-winner Denzel Washington of 'Glory' excels as the incorrectly convicted boxer that earned his nickname 'Hurricane' from the gale-force rage of blows he dealt his opponents in the ring. Dan Hedaya, who was not surprisingly overlooked for his villainous portrayal of the evil Della Pesca, richly deserved a Best Supporting Oscar. Veteran director Norman Jewison, who made 'A Soldier's Story,' streamlines the truth for dramatic impact, particularly Della Pesca, not a real person but a metaphor for the corruption and injustice of the New Jersey criminal justice system. Despite the liberties that Jewison and scenarists Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon take with the truth, 'The Hurricane' scores ten stars out of ten stars.",10,1,5,3 April 2008
Where Eagles Dare," Simply Said, The Best World War II Movie About Espionage and Intrigue Made in the 1960s!!!
","Clint Eastwood probably killed more of Adolf Hitler's storm troopers in director Brian G. Hutton's 'Where Eagles Dare' than he did western outlaws as either Sergio Leone's Man with No Name in the 'Dollars' trilogy or criminals as 'Dirty Harry' in his five Warner Brothers crime epics. Bestselling Scottish author Alistair MacLean penned the splendid screenplay that he later converted into a much tamer novel about a team of elite British M.I. 6 secret agents that parachute into Germany to rescue a high-ranking officer with a mother lode of knowledge about the June 6th Normandy landings. This atmospheric MGM blockbuster--clocking in at 158 minutes--is probably the greatest action-adventure opus with a World War II setting ever produced. We're talking wall-to-wall gunfire with more surprises and complications than most movies envisage. Burton and Eastwood appear in top form, and busty Ingrid Pitt and Mary Ure as undercover female agents give them considerable help and guidance. 'Where Eagles Dare' is also notable for composer Rod Goodwin's percussive orchestral soundtrack. Goodwin carved out a niche for himself in World War II movie soundtracks with '633 Squadron,' 'Force 10 from Navarone,' 'Operation Crossbow,' and 'The Battle of Britain.' Some war movies take an anti-war stance, but neither Hutton nor MacLean had higher ideals on their collective minds when they made this war-as-an-adventure epic. If you are a World War II movie buff and you haven't seen 'Where Eagles Dare,' then you need to get yourself a copy of this memorable massacre.Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern of 'Royal Flash') sends a group of British commandos on a suicidal mission to rescue U.S.A.F.F. General George Carnaby, (Robert Beatty of '2001: A Space Odyssey') one of the overall coordinators of planning for the second front, Canby has been is imprisoned in an impregnable mountain fortress called the Schloss Adler, a.k.a 'the Castle of the Eagles.' As it turns out, the Schloss Adler is the headquarters for the German Secret Service in Southern Bavaria. Colonel Wyatt Turner, DSO MC (Patrick Wymark of 'The League of Gentlemen') informs them that the castle is named appropriately 'because only an eagle can get to it.' Apparently, on a night flight to Crete, Carnaby's British Mosquito was shot down by a wandering Luftwaffe Messerschmitt and the Mosquito crashed in near the town of Werfen. Major Jonathan Smith (Richard Burton of 'Raid on Rommel'), Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood of 'Kelly's Heroes'), Captain James Christiansen (Donald Houston of '633 Squadron'), Sergeant Harrod (Brook Williams of 'The Wild Geese'), Captain Philip Thomas (William Squire of 'Alexander the Great'), Sergeant Jock MacPherson (Neil McCarthy of 'Zulu'), and Edward Berkeley (Peter Barkworth of 'Seven Keys') are to parachute into Germany, enter the castle and snatch Carnaby.One of the sergeants suggests at the briefing that the R.A.F. fill a bomb-laden plane and crash it into the mountain fortress. Rolland reminds him that killing an American general might anger General Eisenhower. No sooner have our heroes bailed out than one of them, the radio operator, is found dead in the snow with a broken neck. The Gestapo raids a tavern in Werfen and arrests the rest and takes them separately for questioning. Smith and Schaffer are hauled away together, but they manage to escape after their car crashes. Smith and Schaffer then climb atop the cable car that ascends to the Schloss Adler. Simultaneous, one of their undercover agents, Mary Ure, is being escorted by a suave but sadistic Gestapo officer in the cable car to work in the castle. Once our heroes have gotten into the castle, Smith interrupts a meeting between high ranking German officers and General Carnaby. Smith proves beyond a doubt to SS-Standartenführer Kramer (Anton Diffring of 'Heroes of the Telemark') and Gen. Rosemeyer (Ferdy Mayne of 'The Fearless Vampire Killers') that he is a double-agent working for the Nazis as well as the British with a night-time call to another high-ranking German general.Eventually, when it comes time to break out of the castle, Smith relies on Schaffer who plasters the place with trip-wire explosives. Once the Nazis realize what is going on, all hell breaks loose. 'Where Eagles Dare' the movie surpasses MacLean's own novel; he wrote the screenplay and he provides Richard Burton with some of the greatest lines that you'll ever hear in the World War II movie. Indeed, 'Where Eagles Dare' is the best World War II thriller that Burton and Eastwood ever made, with Burton making more W.W. II thrillers than Eastwood. The rest of the cast is first-rate and composer Rod Goodwin of '633 Squadron' provides a memorable score that ramps up the action and intrigue. At 158 minutes, 'Where Eagles Dare' never lets up on either action or excitement. The surprises that crop up in the narrative match the sizzling action sequences. Clearly, this is Brian Hutton's most memorable film, far better than the action comedy romp that he went on to direct 'Kelly's Heroes' with Clint Eastwood after 'Where Eagles Dare' wrapped. For the record, the propeller driven plane that appears during the opening credits is vintage Nazi plane. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the fighter planes that Smith and Schaffer blow up in the last major shoot out sequence.Hollywood has yet to equal 'Where Eagles Dare.'",10,5,8,29 May 2008
National Treasure," Cage's best white-knuckled actioneer since 'Con-Air'
","The only characters missing from director John Turteltaub's 'National Treasure' (*** out of ****) are Scooby Doo and Casper, the Friendly Ghost. Otherwise, this lightweight but entertaining 'live-action' Walt Disney-produced adventure opus about an invisible treasure map on the flip-side of the Declaration of Independence lands somewhere between an Indiana Jones cliff-hanger and an bloodless 'A-Team' TV episode. The people who made 'National Treasure' have recycled every cliché in the 'quest-for-buried-treasure genre' and borrowed ideas from bestsellers ranging from 'Raise The Titanic' to 'The Da Vinci Code' to make this harmless hokum about the exploits of the Knights Templar and the Free Masons. After suffering through a string of box office losers, including 'Windtalkers,' 'Matchstick Men,' and 'Adaptation,' actor Nicolas Cage finally has another hit under his belt, thanks largely to 'Pirates of the Caribbean' producer Jerry Bruckheimer. 'National Treasure' amounts to an anthology of Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew stories with grown-up go-getters. 'National Treasure' ranks as Cage's best white-knuckled actioneer since 'Con-Air.' Anybody looking for ideal Thanksgiving Day fare will find few faults with the kid-friendly, PG-rated 'National Treasure,' unless you think about what you watch while you watch it. Sure, 'National Treasure' is hopelessly unrealistic, overwhelmingly unconvincing, and predictable from start to finish, but the chemistry conjured up between cast members, especially Cage and leading lady Diane Kruger as well as Jon Voight as his quarrelsome father, make this tongue-in-cheek tale downright fun to watch. At times, 'National Treasure' acts like a 1930's screwball comedy masquerading as a sophisticated heist caper. Best of all, director John Turteltaub of 'Instinct' and 'Phenomenon' keeps this 100-minute melodrama moving at a whiplash pace with hyperbolic heroics occurring in every other scene. Okay, its credibility strained to the breaking point, 'National Treasure' huffs and puffs through its last quarter hour to deliver its inevitable happy ending, with a chance for a sequel.Nicolas Cage plays good guy Benjamin Franklin Gates, a discredited historian as well as ex-Navy diver, who believes that America's Founding Fathers concealed a cache of loot amassed from other countries that constitutes our version of the Holy Grail. This high-concept premise would have been perfect for a Depression-era romantic comedy back in the 193Os. Anyway, Turteltaub and writers Jim Kouf of 'Rush Hour' & 'Operation Dumbo Drop' and Cormac & Marianne Wibberley of 'I Spy,' 'The 6th Day,' and 'Bad Boys 2' lay out all the necessary exposition that audiences need to know in the first 15 minutes. Exposition is the information that the characters already know, but they have to discuss openly among themselves, so that audiences will understand what's happening. Once they've established their improbable premise, Turteltaub and company never look back. 'National Treasure' barrels along like an old-fashioned Republic serial with its heroes and adversaries lunging intrepidly through one flaming hoop after another. As it turns out, our stalwart hero's crusade to uncover the hoard behind the Declaration of Independence has been something of an obsession to the Gates Clan. In the beginning, an adolescent Benjamin learns about the fabulous fortune from his grandfather (Christopher Plummer of 'Dracula 2000') while his father Patrick (Jon Voight of 'Ali') stands by and scoffs at the fable. Patrick Gates belittles the family quest as a pointless hunt that turns up nothing more than a trail of clues. Initially, the story takes Cage to the Arctic. Fellow treasure hunter Ian Howe (Sean Bean of 'GoldenEye') and he discover an ancient ornate meerschaum pipe in a frozen-over, 19th century wooden sailing vessel. At this point, Howe double-crosses Gates and leaves our protagonist to perish in the icy, inhospitable wasteland. Naturally, our hero and his wise-cracking computer-whiz kid sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha of 'Gigli') escape death just by the hair of their chins. When our heroes learn that the Declaration of Independence contains a treasure map, Gates realizes that Howe, an unscrupulously wealthy Brit, will inevitably steal the document. (The anti-British sentiment in 'National Treasure' may be the film's only lapse in political correctness.) Meanwhile, Riley and he alert the FBI and Washington conservator Dr. Abigail Chase (sexy Diane Kruger of 'Troy'), but neither believe them anymore than anybody believed the old man when he cried 'wolf!' At this point, Gates decides to purloin the Declaration to protect it from Howe. The message here clearly is that the ends sometimes justify the means.'National Treasure' ought to have been called 'National Treasures.' The adrenaline-laced action transpires at the National Archives, the Lincoln Memorial, Philadelphia's Independence Hall, New York's Wall Street Trinity Church, and the Old North Church in Boston. No sooner does our hero swipe the Declaration than he contends with not only the greedy Howe and his gun-toting minions, but also the National Archives conservator who refuses to let the document out of her sight. Gates, Chase, and Riley manage to stay one breathless step ahead of Howe's henchmen and the FBI headed up by Sadusky (Harvey Keitel of 'Reservoir Dogs') until the last half of the movie when Howe gains the upper hand. Harvey Keitel appears to be channeling his Winston Wolfe character from 'Pulp Fiction,' with make-up designed to recall Johnny Depp from 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' Overall, Turteltaub confines violence to the absolute minimum, dispenses almost entirely with profanity, and shows nothing of an overtly sexual nature, typically the bread-and-butter of this type of pulse-pounding potboiler.'National Treasure' doesn't hold up well to close scrutiny, but the characters are so charismatic and the storytelling so snappy that this popcorn thriller will have you cheering from the edge of your seat even though you know there's a happy ending in sight.",8,8,10,18 March 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Taratino's First Crime Thriller is Far-Out!!!
","Writer & director Quentin Tarantino's freshman effort as a helmer concerns a ruthless criminal gang and a jewelry store robbery gone awry. Indeed, this is the movie that introduced audiences to Tarantino as a director. Ostensibly, without the participation of Harvey Keitel, this movie might never have attracted the critical and popular attention that it eventually garnered. Moreover, 'Reservoir Dogs' would have qualified as little more than routine heist caper were it not for the distinctive Tarantino treatment. Compared with his later film 'Pulp Fiction,' which reinvented the crime thriller, 'Reservoir Dogs' qualifies as a relatively modest effort. Basically, an undercover Los Angeles cop infiltrates a gang of professional thieves and discovers that getting shot in the stomach is all in a day's work. No, this is not the kind of movie that prompt anybody to resort to a life of crime because everybody here faces the consequences of their actions. Squeamish people who abhor the sight of blood and gore might find Tarantino's film highly objectionable. When individuals are shot, they bleed profusely. One character spends more than half of the movie wallowing in a pool of his own blood. The most notorious scene involves a psychopath who tortures a tied-up Los Angeles policeman for information. During the interrogation, the hood carves off the cop's ear without a qualm. Those who prefer happy endings should definitely avoid this tragic thriller.Violent, profane, ribald, ironic and sometimes sickeningly sadistic, 'Reservoir Dogs' consists largely of provocative conversations with an occasional bloodbath of a shoot-out thrown in to punctuate all this loquacity. Tarantino thumbs his nose at conventional storytelling methods and orchestrates the gritty events in this laconic 99-minute melodrama so that they occur out of chronological order. Indeed, Tarantino's decision to tell his story with no apparent order with regard to the progression of events enhances 'Reservoir Dogs' and adds to its substance. Mind you, in some instances, juggling the chronology of a story may impair suspense, but that doesn't happen here. Furthermore, Tarantino delivers his brand of flavorful dialogue with some 272 uses of the F-word, and the stories that the thugs swap foreshadow the kinds of narratives that 'Pulp Fiction' would contain. No Tarantino movie would be complete without numerous references to older movies and one conversation compares a character to the short-lived African-American television series 'Get Christy Love.' Despite its micro-budget, this 1992 crime drama boasts a fabulous cast, including Harvey Keitel, Christopher Penn, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, and legendary screen veteran Lawrence Tierney. Comedian Steven Wright contributes a deadpan but soulful voice-over performance as a radio disc jockey, and musical supervisors Kathy Nelson and Karyn Rachtman provide several golden oldies from the 1970s that haven't been run into the ground in previous films. Harvey Keitel and the entire cast are nothing short of superb.",10,0,0,13 May 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Vikings Versus Dragons!!!
","This groundbreaking animated actioneer from co-directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders about a teenager who grows up on an island that flying dragons constantly raid is terrific from fade-in to fade-out. Basically, 'How To Train Your Dragon' tackles the theme of intolerance. Hiccup is the son of an intimidating Viking warrior chief, Stoick (Gerard Butler of 'Gamer'),and the Vikings have been waging a war with the dragons since the dawn of time and killing them. Nevertheless, the dragons keep on coming back to raid the island of its livestock and fishing hauls. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel of 'She's Out of my League')dreams of becoming a Viking, but his dear old dad is pretty dubious about the prospect of his son having anything remotely to do with combat. Hiccup wields a small cannon with a projectile that looks like a net to trap a dragon. Hiccup doesn't trap just any dragon. The dragon that Hiccup brings down is an exotic specimen that his Viking ancestors have left virtually blank in their recognition manual of dragons. Eventually, Hiccup discovers the poor little dragon trapped in the depression of a lake because it cannot attain enough altitude to escape. It seems that one part of the dragon's tale fins that stabilize its ability to fly is missing. Relying on his ingenuity, Hiccup fashions a prosthesis so that will enable the little fellow to fly. Of course, all of this is like the scene in a venerable western where the kid tames a horse and learns how to ride it. Hiccup winds up calling the dragon by the nickname of 'Toothless.' When the dragon isn't prepared to chow down, it appears as if it doesn't have teeth, but Toothless does have teeth. Naturally, Hiccup's father is impressed when a fellow Viking tells him that Hiccup isn't the waste of breath that his father believes that he is. Indeed, Hiccup and his father sit down and have their first face-to-face conversation together because they have something to share.Incidentally, 'How to Train Your Dragon' could be subtitled 'How To Train Your Father.' You see, Hiccup's mom is only a memory, having died years ago. Gerald Butler provides the voice of Hiccup's father and he is a joy to hear. Predictably, Hiccup faces his greatest challenge when he survives all the tests in an arena with various dragons. All these dragons look ridiculous rather than scary. Anyway, when he is given the chance to slay his first dragon, Hiccup has to turn it down. Hiccup cannot kill, but he can make any dragon bow down to him. The 3-D effects are stunning. The formulaic plot takes on an entirely different significance with an ending that you'd NEVER imagine you would see in a kiddie flick. The generational gap that separates father and son and the prejudice that the father has toward dragons (the only good dragon is a dead dragon sums up his attitude) could be apply to anything or anybody who hates something or somebody because of the dictates of tradition. Sure, Hiccup emerges as the ultimate underdog hero, and Toothless is such an adorable little fellow. Picture the head of a catfish, the wings of a bat, the tale of a dragon all the color of soot black. You will want one of these exotic Night Fury dragons for a pet! This movie has many surprises in store for you, great action sequences, and a never before seen ending that contains more realism that we have come to expect from such a movie. Yes, there is a happy ending. Okay, some of the dragon sequences might frighten impressionable little kiddies.",10,2,4,13 May 2010
Limitless," A Move That Thinks Outside of the Box!
","Scientists have been assuring us for years that we use only about 10 to 20 per cent of our brain. What if you could mobilize more than 80 per cent of your mind to solve your problems? Would you be happier? More productive? 'The Illusionist' director Neil Burger and 'Mrs. Doubtfire' scenarist Leslie Dixon explore this 'what if' premise in witty but speculative saga 'Limitless,' based on Irish novelist Alan Glynn's 2001 techno-thriller 'The Dark Fields.' Some of the details have changed during the transition from page to screen, but the imaginative plot remains reasonably intact. When an aspiring novelist afflicted with writer's block resorts to an experimental opiate—kind of like Adderall--that enables him to not only finish his novel ahead of time but also emerge as a savant of sorts, he discovers addiction may be the least of his woes. This out-of-the- ordinary futuristic murder mystery about a slacker who learns that the sky is no longer the limit generates considerable charisma throughout its nimble 104 minutes because leading man Bradley Cooper makes the hero so sympathetic despite his sardonic personality. A couple of movies about protagonists who acquired higher brain power through either pharmaceuticals or surgery have been made, including 'The Lawnmower Man' (1992) with Pierce Brosnan and 'Charly' (1968) with Cliff Robertson. In both movies, the protagonists were mentally challenged, but the 'Limitless' leading man isn't handicapped. Instead, he is a hopeless procrastinator who lacks the ability to focus his energy and efforts to complete tasks. The odyssey that our hero embarks on puts 'Limitless' in the same offbeat category as the Brad Pitt & Edward Norton movie 'Fight Club' with its innovation use of computer generated imagery. Burger uses the CGI here primarily to reflect the paranoid-inducing impact of the drug, but he doesn't flaunt it to the extremes of most contemporary melodramas.'Limitless' opens with our protagonist dramatically poised on the ledge of his ultra-high-rise Manhattan apartment as he contemplates performing a header into the street hundreds of feet below. A group of Neanderthal thugs are trying to break down the door to his super-secure apartment because he has something that they want. They are prepared to kill him without a qualm and he can do nothing to stop them. Eddie Mora (Bradley Cooper of 'The Hangover') takes a jaundiced view of his predicament and then he explains how he wound up in this tight spot as 'Limitless' shifts gears into flashback mode. In the beginning, Eddie was an author who landed a book contract. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to conjure up a single sentence. No matter how long he stares at his computer, he cannot get his creative juices to flow. Eddie's girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish of 'Sucker Punch') decides that she would be better off without him and they split. Not only does she get a better job, but also she has grown tired of footing their bills. Our unhappy protagonist is wandering the streets when he runs into his former brother-in-law, Vernon (Johnny Whitworth of 'Empire Records'), and they grab a drink at a bar. Vernon tells Eddie that he is no longer a small potatoes drug dealer. Indeed, he works for a pharmaceutical firm that has developed an $800-a-pop miracle pill called NZT-84. Vernon adds that the drug is on the verge of receiving FDA approval. Initially, Eddie is leery of Vernon's hype, but he decides to try it. Presto! Eddie polishes off his book and his prose blows his editor's mind. Eddie asks Vernon for some more, but somebody kills him before our hero can get the pills. Nevertheless, Eddie finds Vernon's stash, borrows thousands from a Russian mobster, Gennady (Andrew Howard of 'Revolver') and parlays it into an overnight fortune. Eddie's exploits bring him to the attention of a legendary Wall Street tycoon, Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro of 'Goodfellas'), and our hero helps him acquire even more millions. Eddie even wins back Lindy, but he cannot get the Russian off his back. The Russian gets a taste of the drug and wants more. Moreover, another mysterious man is tailing Eddie everywhere, and this ruffian doesn't mind wielding a knife to get what he wants. Suddenly, everything good that happened to Eddie turns really bad.'Limitless' describes the exciting arc that Eddie traverses in his journey from 'nobody' status to 'somebody' status. Typically, this kind of materialistic movie degenerates into a heavy-handed Faustian morality play. In other words, the hero experiences a meteoric rise, only to suffer the consequences of a tragic downfall. The downfall occurs because he relinquishes his power to control his destiny. Meaning, at some point, he sells out for the short term and pays for it with his life in the long term. John Travolta made a similar movie, 'Phenomenon' (1996), where he manifested mental powers beyond anything he had experienced. The toll that these powers exacted ended up killing him. He was no more irresponsible than the 'Limitless' hero. Nevertheless, Hollywood rules dictated that the Travolta had to perish. The people who made 'Limitless' don't subscribe to this mentality. Bradley Cooper's heroic character fares much better that the John Travolta character. Although our hero boasts mental powers beyond anything that anybody else has, Eddie refuses to abuse his gift and 'Limitless' allows him to reap the rewards. Indeed, he winds up enjoying the last laugh on villainous Robert De Niro. Mind you, this represents De Niro's best work since 'The Score' in 2001. Happily, Burger and Dixon use Eddie's rambling voice-over commentary to deliver lots of humor, a technique that only Martin Scorsese usually gets away with in his mafia movies. Burger stages a bravura fight scene and intercuts it with footage of martial arts superstar Bruce Lee. Altogether, 'Limitless' qualifies as a startlingly original film about our prescriptive, self-medicating society that ventures where most Hollywood movies dare not.",9,0,2,26 March 2011
Don't Breathe," Wait Until Death
","Horror movies have grown increasingly lazier these days with their dependence on jump-scares to terrify audiences. As the exception to this rule, 'Don't Breathe' shuns jump-scares for a frightening storyline. 'Evil Dead' writer & director Fede Alvarez and co-scripter Rodo Sayagues have created a superior, spine-tingling saga of suspense, sparse on dialogue, but swarming with surprises that will make your skin crawl throughout its tense 88 minutes. Mind you, one of those standard-issue scary movie tropes remains intact in this gripping, atmospheric opus. Nevertheless, you'll experience as much paranoia as our protagonists who find themselves trapped and terrorized in this home invasion thriller. The set-up is incredibly simple. Three teens have a foolproof plan for burglary. Equipped with the security codes and ways to silence alarms, these three should be prepared to steal something of value. A golden opportunity lands in their laps. Not only do they have a chance to score drastically with one big haul, but they may also never have to resort to crime again! Not-surprisingly, things begin to go dreadfully sideways almost immediately. They have learned about a blind military veteran, injured by grenade splinters in Iraq, who lives alone in a secluded derelict neighborhood and has a million dollars stashed in a safe. If the burglars, two single guys and a single-mom with a kindergarten aged daughter, can pull this off, they will be on easy street. Just as it all seems to be within their grasp, they encounter their worst nightmare. If you've seen the trailer for 'Don't Breathe,' you may have been reminded of the climactic scene in 'Silence of the Lambs' when an FBI agent stumbled around in the dark while a serial killer equipped with night vision goggles stalked her relentlessly in a creepy house. 'Don't Breathe' appropriates that predicament, but expands it radically. Alvarez and Sayagues display imagination galore in this claustrophobic cat and mouse nail-biter, and the suspense never slackens, even after you think that the filmmakers have run out of tricks to torment you.Alex (Dylan Minnette of 'Goosebumps') takes advantage of inside information from his father's security firm so that Rocky (Jane Levy of 'Nobody Walks'), her boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto of 'It Follows'), and he can burglarize houses with little chance of being caught. They have an amazing track record, and they haven't botched up any of these opportunities. 'Don't Breathe' opens with our youthful protagonists rampaging through an affluent house pilfering whatever they find of value. Meantime, the most desperate member of the threesome is Rocky who lives with her abusive mother and struggles to raise an adorable daughter who doesn't have a clue about how amoral her mother is. Alex has a thing for Rocky, and Money struggles jealously to keep his accomplice in line. Later, Money stumbles onto information from the guy that he fences stolen items to that an individual in a remote, virtually unpopulated, Detroit suburb keeps a million dollars in cash squirreled away in his apartment. Our unsavory protagonists carry out surveillance on the neighborhood and are surprised when they spot the so-called 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang of 'Avatar') out in the daylight exercising his pet Rottweiler. When they determine that their victim is in fact sightless, they cannot wait to break into his residence. Initially, they put the Blind Man's pugnacious pooch to sleep in its dog house with a smoky concoction. Nevertheless, gaining entrance to the house proves to be difficult. Indeed, Rocky manages to climb in through a high window. Once the three gain entrance, Money unleashes a crude form of knock-out gas on the slumbering Blind Man to prevent him from interfering with them during the burglary.Unfortunately, despite all of his bravado, Money cannot muster the nerve to pull the trigger on his automatic pistol when the Blind Man catches them by surprise during a harrowing moment. Alex and Rocky are just as shocked by the Blind Man's startling appearance and struggle to hold their breath and stand rooted like statures while the Blind Man kills Money. Eventually, Alex and Rocky manage to hide themselves, with Rocky taking refuge in a closet. She is shocked when the Blind Man enters the closet where she has holed up, but watches in triumph as he opens a safe and inventories the contents. As traumatized as she is by the sudden reversal of events, Rocky decides that she isn't going to leave the house without the loot. She memorizes the digital combination and later cleans out the safe. Alex and her struggle to escape from the Blind Man's house. What might seem like a simple proposition turns out to be an ordeal. The menacing but resourceful Blind Man knows every square inch of his house, and he has it rigged up so nobody can possibly escape. Our protagonists had to go to extraordinary lengths just to effect an entrance, and they discover that getting themselves out is going to be virtually impossible.Now, based on this plot synopsis, you'd think 'Don't Breathe' might degenerate into a predictable blood and gore potboiler, but you'd be entirely wrong. Discretion prevents me from providing greater details about the plot. Some of the complications will have you poised on the edge of your seat with your white-knuckled fists clenching the armrests of your chair. Furthermore, by this time, you may not be as well-disposed about the welfare of the trespassers, since their selfish motives and apparent advantage over the Blind Man him make him appear more sympathetic. Not only do things get more complicated, but the action also takes a truly bizarre twist that you won't foresee. Ultimately, the Blind Man turns the tables on his sighted adversaries, extinguishing all forms of illumination, so they wind up on equal footing with him. Stephen Lang is terrific as the Blind Man who never knows when to quit, while Jane Levy looks suitably horrified by some of the predicaments in which she finds herself. 'Don't Breathe' will leave you gasping.",10,12,28,4 September 2016
Sicario," 'Sicario' Means Suspense and Action
","'Prisoners' director Denis Villeneuve's menacing manhunt melodrama 'Sicario' treats the war against drug cartels and their smuggling operations with even greater cynicism than even the recent David Ayer's opus 'Sabotage' with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Imagine combining 'Silence of the Lambs' with 'Zero Dark Thirty,' and you've got the essence of this no-nonsense, atmospheric epic that boasts more shades of gray than black and white. Emily Blunt plays a by-the-book FBI agent who wades into the murky depths of corruption and evil that threaten to undermine her sanity. Josh Brolin and Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro co-star as the hardcases who need her shield so their shady business doesn't violate the letter of the law. 'Sicario' isn't a slick, superficial, standard-issue, shoot'em up with sensational stunts. Primarily, 'Sicario' argues that the best way to eliminate drug cartels is to fight fire with fire. Similarly, 'Sabotage' appropriated that attitude toward the cartels, but it lacked the credibility that 'Sicario' delivers. The good guys don't wear white hats in 'Sicario.' They display the same conspicuous lack of regard for human life that their adversaries espouse. You don't walk out of 'Sicario' feeling relieved so much as horrified by what it takes to conquer the evil that cartels do. This spartan crime thriller features enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right up to its ending that may abrade your sense of moral rectitude. 'Sicario' opens with a bang as FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt of 'Edge of Tomorrow'), her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya), and the Bureau's Kidnap Response Team smash into a residence in a sleepy little subdivision in sunny Arizona and discover the cartel has been using it as stash house. They scramble inside to rescue hostages, but they find the walls of the house conceal 42 corpses like a contemporary catacomb. Two agents tamper with a booby-trapped outside tool shed, and the explosion shreds them and flattens everybody else. Afterward, a nonchalant guy in flip-flops, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin of 'Gangster Squad'), schedules a meeting with Macer's superior, Dave Jennings (Victor Gaber of 'Argo'), and invites Kate to accompany an inter-agency task force bound for Mexico to pick up a cartel informant. Macer signs up. Later, she watches in horror as Graver and a convoy of black government SUVs careen into Juárez, Mexico. Graver's tight-lipped, second-in-command, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro of 'Savages'), warns Kate not to trust their Mexican Federal Police escort. The naked bodies of dangling corpses garnish the perimeter of this eerie setting. Everything boils down to pulling one individual, Guillermo Diaz (Edgar Arreola of 'Machete'), out of a safe house and hauling him back across the border for interrogation. Not surprisingly, the trip into Mexico is a picnic compared with the trip out. The Task Force finds themselves snarled up in a traffic jam at the border crossing. They aren't entirely surprised when they spot cartel gunmen itching to waste them, and an inevitable shootout ensues. Just as Alejandro warned Kate, the corrupt Mexican Federal Police side with the cartel gunmen and our anxious heroine takes out an MFP officer with well-aimed shots. As suddenly as the shootout erupted, it concludes.All is not what it appears, and Kate suspects that Graver is a CIA agent and Alejandro is a hired gun. 'Nothing will make sense to your American ears,' Alejandro assures Kate. 'And you will doubt everything that we do. But in the end you will understand.' Eventually, she realizes she is being used to lend Graver's operation a veneer of legality. When she confides her fears to his superior, Dave reassures Kate that everything is above-aboard and Graver's exploits have the blessings of highly placed elected officials. Graver explains that Alejandro and he aim to create so much chaos within cartel ranks that the Mexicans will turn on themselves and start killing their own men. This strategy is designed to flush out an anonymous cartel chief whose identity remains a closely guarded secret. Alejandro promises Kate that exposure of this figure will prove catastrophic for this coldblooded criminal organization. The biggest action scene in 'Sicario' has Kate and company entering a covert cartel tunnel, shades of the Vin Diesel thriller 'Fast Five,' and wiping out cartel henchmen in those subterranean depths with a clandestine army of SWAT shooters equipped with night vision technology.'Sicario' qualifies as an impressive, but cynical crime movie. Apart from the heroine and her partner, the protagonists are as unscrupulous as the villains that they have in their sights. Meantime, Kate Macer cannot believe that she has gotten herself trapped in this web of amorality. As idealistic as she is, Kate believes in the rule of law, but she emerges tarnished mentally if not physically by the experience with Graver and Alejandro. Although the talented Emily Blunt toplines this law & order saga, an unshaven Benicio Del Toro claims top honors as a PTSD-afflicted gunman. He plays a former Mexican prosecutor who has suffered more than anybody. The cartel decapitated his wife and drowned his young daughter in a vat of acid, so he shoots first unless he has to ask questions before he fills his enemies with lead. Del Toro gives a smoldering performance. Josh Brolin isn't far behind as an enigmatic CIA agent who deals with every encounter with his adversaries as if he were a surfer gauging waves at the beach. Nothing in 'Sicario' comes off feeling contrived, glamour, and formulaic. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve stages the action scenes at the border crossing and the tunnel with an impersonal air of solemnity. British cinematographer Roger Deakins of 'No Country for Old Men' depicts these escapades in dark, muted colors reminiscent of the classic Dutch painter Rembrandt and effectively captures the moral depravity perpetrated by the principals. Watching a movie like 'Sicario,' you have to wonder whether the wholesale legalization of narcotics—repellent as a solution might seem-- wouldn't offer greater salvation as a whole for everybody rather than futile free-for-all combat.",10,4,10,4 October 2015
Pretty Woman," Pretty Entertaining Pabulum
","'Pretty Woman' is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, 'Pretty Woman' wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and 'Pretty Woman' charts their fate together.Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of 'The Professionals') refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human.Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.",8,0,1,10 July 2012
Some Like It Hot," The Greatest Cross-Dressing Comedy Ever!!!
","'Double Indemnity' director Billy Wilder created the ultimate cross-dressing comedy with 'Some Like It Hot.' The sight of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dressed up as a couple of female is unforgettable! Wilder and long-time collaborator I.A.L. Diamond based their screenplay on 'Fanfaren der Liebe' (1951), an original German musical. This lively farce about men masquerading as women juggles broard slapstick with sly sexual innuendo. The premise that two hopelessly red-blooded American guys could conceal themselves in a woman's only band is outrageous. Indeed, despite the amendments made to the Production Code in the wake of the Frank Sinatra classic 'The Man with the Golden Arm,' 'Some Like It Hot' managed to raise a lot of eyebrows. United Artists released the film without the MPAA logo in the credits or title sequence because the Production Code refused to give it their approval. Similarly, the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency gave 'Some Like It Hot' their 'C' rating which stands for 'condemned.' Believe it or not, Bob Hope starred in another movie called 'Some Like It Hot' in 1939, but it shared on similarities with the 1959 movie aside from having the same title.The action unfolds in Chicago, 1929, as the police pursue a hearse and riddle it with gunfire. The guys riding in the back of the hearse aren't funeral attendants. Instead, they are some rough-looking mobsters armed with pump-action shotguns. They manage to elude the cops, but irreparable damage has been done. They raise the lid on the coffin and several bottles of shattered bootleg hooch are among the many other bottles. Notorious hoodlum Spats Columbo (George Raft of 'Background to Danger'), owns a speak easy that served liquor in coffee cups. Chicago Detective Mulligan (Pat O'Brien of 'Angels with Dirty Faces') busts up the party at Mozarella's and has some tough words with Spats. Meanwhile, Joe (Tony Curtis of 'The Vikings') and Jerry (Jack Lemmon of 'Mister Roberts') give the police the slip and escape. Joe wagers everything that they have on a 10-to-1 dog, Greased Lightning, at the race track and they come up losers. Sig Poliakoff (Billy Gray of 'Two for the Seesaw') gets them a one-night stand in Urbana, but the boys have no car. Joe talks an old girlfriend out of her green coupe for the 100 miles that they have to drive. The musicians head for the garage, but complications ensue. They take refuge behind a car and witness the infamous 'St. Valentine's Day Massacre' and they can identify the ringleader, who had his men wipe out another gang in a blaze of gunfire.Jerry and Joe are so desperate to clear out of the Windy City that they dress up in drag so they can get a job with an all-girl band scheduled to play in Florida. They change their names to Josephine and Geraldine, but Jerry has second thoughts and changes his name to Daphne. They climb aboard the train to Florida. The upper berth scene on the train is a classic. Earlier, Jerry covered for Sugar Kane (Marilyn Moore of 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes') when she dropped her flask after a performance on the train. Sweet Sue (Joan Shawlee of 'Prehistoric Women') and her manager Beinstock (Dave Barry of 'High Society') had warned Sugar that they don't approve of her drinking and will drop her from the band if they catch her with a drop of liquor. Anyway, Sugar climbs into Daphne's berth above Josephine's berth and before they realize it all the girls in the band are mixing up drinks and bringing crackers. When the girls drop ice down Daphne's back, it is just too much for Jerry and he yanks on the emergency brake cord. After they arrivein Florida, Daphne has to deal with elderly tycoon Osgood Fielding II(Joe E. Brown of 'Earthworm Tractors') who pinches her/him in the elevator, while Joe disguises himself as a millionaire with a yacht, Junior, and turns his charm on Sugar. Since Sugar has a weakness for men with glasses, Joe sports spectacles as Junior. Eventually, Columbo and his henchmen migrate south and show up at the hotel.The ending is hilarious!",10,1,1,5 April 2010
Inside Man," Be Prepared For Lots of Surprises!
","'Inside Man' qualifies as the slickest movie that 'Do The Right Thing' director Spike Lee has ever made. A criminal mastermind Dalton Russell (Clive Owen of 'Sin City') and his cohorts masquerade as painters, enter a Manhattan bank during business hours, take hostages,force their hostages to strip to their underwear and then make don the same outfits that Dalton and his crew are wearing. Meanwhile, a cop on the beat sends out the alarm when he notices something suspicious at the bank and the N.Y.P.D. surround the building. N.Y.P.D. Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe of 'Mr. Bean's Holiday') deploys his army of blue uniforms and erects a command post not far from the front door. Detective Keith Frazier (a bald-headed Denzel Washington of 'Mo Better Blues') is surprised when his boss sends him in to serve as the hostage negotiator. It seems that the regular hostage negotiator is on vacation, so Frazierwho is under suspicion for a missing cache of lootgets the assignment. Meanwhile, the man who built the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer of 'The Sound of Music'), hires a go-between, cold-as-ice Madeleine White (Jodie Foster of 'Taxi Driver'), to protect his interests, particularly the contents of safe deposit box number 392. Ms. White persuades the mayor to let her enter the bank and chat with Dalton about his options.Initially, 'Inside Man' shapes up to be a top-notch, perfect heist thriller, but it isn't what it appears. At least, Dalton and his people are not out to rob the bank in terms of money. Instead, they set out to expose the chairman of the board of directors of the bank, Mr. Case, who has a deadly secret that he wants to keep from the public. Namely, Mr. Case had some suspicious dealings with the Nazis involving Holocaust victims. Call it a cold case that turns red hot before fadeout. 'Inside Man' puts Spike Lee into distinctly different surroundings. This is a big movie with logistics, not Spike's usual small production with a straight-forward agenda. He spends more time throwing red herrings at us than taking us through the permutations of a hostage negotiation thriller. 'Blind Justice' TV scenarist Russell Gerwirtz has constructed a thriller with a labyrinth. Not unsurprisingly, the principals pay homage to director Sidney Lument's hostage thriller 'Dog Day Afternoon' when Dalton and Frazier talk about getting buses to transport his hostages and crew to the airport. Neither Lee nor Gerwirtz set aside much time for character development, aside from Det. Frazier's pursuit of a promotion, his relationship with his yearning for marriage girlfriend, and the mystery of the missing money from a previous assignment. The Jodie Foster character is as anonymous as Clive Owen's Dalton Russell. 'Inside Man' is the kind of movie where you have no idea what is going on the entire time until the ending, which is pretty clever but not as satisfying as you might have expected given the set-up.The film benefits from first-rate photography, editing,and surroundings, but Terence Blanchard's orchestral score is very overbearing and intrusive at times. The structure of the action is uncomfortable as Lee and Gerwirtz splice in scenes of Frazier interrogating hostages released from the bank during the situation. Be prepared for lots of surprises. This is Spike Lee's best movie in terms of a big Hollywood production since 'Do The Right Thing.' He brings up racism only in minor scenes. The only other complaint is that--along with those interrogation scenes that interrupt the flow of the action, 'Inside Man' could have been about 10 minutes leaner without losing any of its considerable punch.",9,1,3,23 September 2007
Pulp Fiction," Brilliant!
","Writer and director Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' qualified as a revelation when it came out in 1994, and time has not diminished the impact of this landmark film. This crime melodrama about a pair of philosophical hit men, a treacherous boxer, a cocaine-snorting drug dealer's wife, and a cleaner shifts back and forth between tragic drama and helium comedy with irony galore. If Tarantino had not made any other movie, he would still have been assured a niche in cinematic history with 'Pulp Fiction.' He juggles four complicated plot lines about an eccentric gallery of characters who are all low-lives in one way of another living on the fringe of society, whether they be murderers, thieves, narcotics dealers, sexual perverts, or small-time, pistol-wielding crooks. 'Pulp Fiction' defies chronological time because Tarantino stages everything out of order. This fractured form of storytelling might alienate those spectators accustomed to chronological order. Not one minute of this marathon two hour and forty-five minute audacity is dull. Ultimately, Tarantino and co-scenarist Roger Avary received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Tarantino for Best Director, the film itself for Best Picture, John Travolta for Best Actor, Sally Menke for Best Editing, and Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman respectively for Best Supporting Male and Female roles. Over ten years later 'Pulp Fiction' is still outstanding, largely because it is such a timeless tale of amoral mayhem. Tarantino's quotable dialogue, his articulate underworld thugs, and his archly sardonic take on life retains its vivacity. Inspite of the scrambled up stories, Tarantino plots everything very carefully, foreshadowing situations and predicaments, with characters facing the consequences of their actions. Tarantino inspired a generation of movie makers, but none of them have come close to eclipsing his masterpiece.'Pulp Fiction' opens in a restaurant with Ringo/Pumpkin (Tim Roth of 'Reservoir Dogs') discussing the various problems involved in the art of robbery with his girlfriend Yolanda/Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer of 'The Prophecy')and their impulsive decision to rob the restaurant. Colorful credits follow and Tarantino introduces us to Jules (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Shaft') and Vincent (John Travolta of 'Saturday Night Fever') as Vincent talks about the difference between what hamburgers are called in Amsterdam. A quarter-pounder is called a Royale with cheese and most food is referred to using the metric system. They arrive at an apartment where they are supposed to pick up an attaché case from four twentysomething guys as a part of a deal that went south. Jules questions Brett (Frank Whaley of 'The Doors') about the guy's questionable business practices with Jules' boss Marsellus Wallace. All the dumbfounded Brett can utter after he witnesses Jules shoot one of his friends on a sofa in cold blood is the word 'What?' Jules warns him not to say 'what' again. Nevertheless, Brett says 'What' five times and Jules puts a bullet in his shoulder. Vincent and Jules retrieve the mysterious suitcase, but not before another guy bursts from the bathroom with a 'cannon' like revolver and fires indiscriminately at them. The guy misses each time and Jules and Vincent blow him away and leave with the case and another bystander, Marvin (Phil LaMarr of 'Old Dogs') after they kill Brett.",10,1,3,21 May 2010
Jack Reacher," Good 4 A Cruise or 2
","I enjoyed the new Tom Cruise thriller 'Jack Reacher,' but I'm not a big Tom Cruise fans. Since I rarely have enough time to read the right stuff, I haven't perused any of the seventeen Jack Reacher novels about a former U.S. Army investigator who roams the country like a lone wolf. Sounds to me like Cruise is searching for another franchise to topline. Award-winning, international bestselling author Lee Child is an interesting fellow himself. Actually, his real name is Jim Grant, and he was born in 1954. A former Granada Television producer, he hails from Great Britain, but has since moved to America. He acknowledge that Cruise look nothing like his literary character, but he has praised this cinematic adaptation. Chris Hemsworth, Dwayne Johnson, and Liam Neeson might have been better in the titular role. Nevertheless, this intelligent but contrived murder/mystery couldn't have been released at a worse time. It will be interesting to see how major Hollywood blockbusters about gun-toting heroes fare in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. The worst thing you can say about 'Jack Reacher' is that it is a gritty but formulaic police procedural with murky bad guys conducting calculated criminal acts. No maniacs break into schools and murder innocent lambs. As entertaining as 'Jack Reacher' is, this Paramount Pictures release doesn't surpass other Cruises epics, such as 'Collateral,' 'Top Gun,' 'Mission Impossible 2,' 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol,' and 'The Last Samurai.' Basically, 'Jack Reacher' qualifies as an energetic, above-average, but predictable murder mystery. Tom Cruise and his leading lady Rosamund Pike kindle little chemistry. At an imposing 130 minutes, 'Jack Reacher' couldn't have made time for a romance between the itinerant hero and the district attorney's virtuous daughter. Several scenes are questionable, and some things just don't seem right. Happily, 'Jack Reacher' boasts more hits than misses. A restrained Cruise appears to be channeling Paul Newman with his laconic performance, but 'Jack Reacher' isn't a role that fits him like a glove. Basically, this Spartan, low-key thriller could have used a rewrite or two to enhance it. Moreover, if screen veteran Robert Duvall—long past his prime—hadn't shown up for the bullet-blasting finale, 'Jack Reacher' wouldn't be worth jack. Comparisons between the film and a synopsis of the novel indicate writer & director Christopher McQuarrie hasn't deviated drastically from the source material. Consequently, 'Jack Reacher' amounts to an origins epic. Cruise plays an enigmatic individual, not unlike the Jim Caviezel character John Reese in the CBS-TV seriesn'Person of Interest.' Resourceful guys like these two live off the grid. The chief difference is Reacher shuns the kind of support Reese has in the form of computer genius Harold Finch.When a deadly sniper guns down several people in broad daylight without warning in Pittsburgh, the local authorities get a break and capture the unsuspecting gunman. The local District Attorney tries to bully a confession out of their suspect, an ex-Army sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora of 'Safe'), but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he asks them to contact Jack Reacher. Before his case comes up for trial, Barr is badly beaten up in prison and his life hangs in the balance. Out of nowhere, Jack Reacher materializes with everybody least expects him. Reacher talks with the D.A., and later with Barr's attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike of 'Die Another Day'), who has taken the case against her father's stern advice. Repeatedly, Reacher assures Helen that he is not a defense witness. He explains to Helen that Barr left the Army after going on a shooting rage. when he didn't have a chance to rack up any kills in his combat zone. The more that Reacher investigates the shootings, the more he comes to believe that Barr is a patsy. Nothing that the real shooter did corresponds with anything that Barr would have done based on his military training. Before it is over with, our hero reexamines the casualties of the massacre and finds the answer to a cover-up that looks like it goes into the highest levels of law enforcement in Pittsburgh, the Office of the District Attorney.Make no mistake, 'Jack Reacher' isn't a high-octane actioneer, but it is both believable and complex. McQuarrie keeps our hero jumping through flaming hoops throughout most of the action. An exciting, urban car chase with Cruise actually behind the wheel and a no-nonsense street fight enliven the action when a variety of characters aren't conferring about the business at hand. Among film geeks, Christopher McQuarrie is known as the guy who wrote the classic thriller 'The Usual Suspects.' Not only did McQuarrie not adapt Lee Child's crime thriller about a mysterious 'Lone Ranger' type who spurns all twenty-first century conveniences to solve crime, but he also directed it. McQuarrie proves once again that he is a better writer than a director. Some scenes play better than others. The supporting cast, including Richard Jenkins as the District Attorney and David Oyelowo as a Pittsburgh detective, are good. 'Jack Reacher' is worth seeing at least once in a movie theater.",8,5,14,23 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," This Sequel Is A Blast!!!
","'Super' writer/director James Gunn took moviegoers for an irreverent, interplanetary joyride, peppered with pop culture references, in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' back in 2014. Happily, Gunn's sequel 'Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2' qualifies as just as impressive with several surprises. If you haven't seen 'GoTG, Vol. 1,' then you may have problems putting both the swashbuckling characters and their outlandish backstory into context in this imaginative, science-fiction, follow-up saga. Good sequels always dig deeper into the original characters and conjure up newcomers. 'GoTG, Vol. 2' reassembles the same quintet and scrutinizes them in greater detail. Peter Quill, ostensibly the Guardians' leader, catches up with his enigmatic sire, Ego, and father and son surprise each other with their goals during the second act. We learn that Ego has been searching the universe for his long, lost son. Later, Yondu observes astutely about the grandiose Ego: 'He may have been your father, Quill, but he wasn't your daddy.' This father and son connection yields the ultimate surprise, too, but discretion prevents me from divulging specifics. The peculiar relationship that Quill has forged with Yondu Udonta, the extraterrestrial space pirate who abducted Quill from Earth after the lad fled from the hospital where his cancer-stricken mom died takes on an added dimension. No character changes as much in 'GoTG 2' as Yondu. He evolves from a lowlife villain to an individual of integrity. Meanwhile, sibling rivalry keeps Quill's quasi-girlfriend Gamora locked into a never-ending feud with her jealous sister Nebula. Nebula hates Gamora with a passion because their evil stepfather Thanos preferred Gamora over her. Smutty-mouthed Rocket Raccoon remains as obnoxious as ever, but his bad-tempered attitude thaws during the third act. Good sequels send off the characters onto exciting new adventures against different villains. The Guardians are summoned to a remote corner of the cosmos again. The new aliens—the Sovereigns—constitute a petulant people with little sense of humor. When the Rocket infuriates them, the latter pursue the Guardians with a vengeance until greater powers interfere.The last time we saw the Guardians, the Nova Corps had cleared them of all crimes and provided them with a refurnished version of his spaceship 'The Milano.' The arboreal, sentient-like, extraterrestrial Groot (Vin Diesel's voice) had sacrificed himself to save his companions, but Rocket Raccoon scourged up a surviving twig and has planted it. As 'GoTG, Vol. 2,' unfolds, an arrogant race of gilded humanoids known as the Sovereigns have employed our motley crew to protect their priceless batteries from an enormous but absurd-looking trout with thrashing tentacles and thousands of thorny teeth. During this hilarious opening credits gambit, the roguish Star-Lord (Chris Pratt of 'The Magnificent Seven'), green-skinned Amazon Gamora (Zoe Saldana of 'Colombiana'), blue-skinned hulk Drax (Dave Bautista of 'Spectre'), and pugnacious Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper's voice) tangle with this cartoonish Cthulhu-thing atop a lofty platform that resembles an electric razor where the batteries are housed. During this far-fetched fracas, Baby Groot dances to a tune from Star-Lord's mix tape—ELO's 'Blue Sky'--oblivious to any peril the goofy trout-squid poses while the Guardians struggle to defeat their nemesis. The scene is clever because Gunn choreographs this blockbuster action scene with Baby Groot in the foreground rather than the contentious Guardians! Afterward, the grateful Sovereigns reward our heroes with nothing less than Gamora's deceitful sister Nebula. No sooner have our heroes proved their nerve to the Sovereigns than they find themselves in trouble with them. The contemptuous Rocket has taken it upon himself steal some of those valuable batteries. The incensed Sovereigns deployed a drone fleet to annihilate the Guardians. Conveniently, Peter Quill's biological father Ego (Kurt Russell of 'The Hateful 8') intervenes and saves them from the Sovereigns. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to accompany him to his planet, while Rocket, Baby Groot, and Nebula stay behind to repair their crashed spacecraft.Meantime, the haughty Sovereign Queen Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki of 'The Great Gatsby') hires arrow-whistling Ravager chieftain Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker of 'The Belk Experiment') to track down the Guardians. What Yondu doesn't realize is a perfidious faction within his gang of smugglers has been plotting mutiny. Yondu's grotesque lieutenant, Taserface (Chris Sullivan of 'Imperium'), heads this uprising. After they catch up with Rocket, Baby Groot, Nebula, the insubordinate Ravagers turn on Yondu and lock him up with Rocket. Nevertheless, Yondu and Rocket aren't idle behind bars for long because Baby Groot helps them to escape. Mind you, Yondu was already up to his ears in trouble with the rest of the Ravagers and their commander, Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone of 'Rocky'), who turned against him for kidnapping Peter Quill in the first place. If you saw the original 'G0TG,' you know Star-Lord tricked Yondu when he relinquished the Orb. The wily Star-Lord replaced the Infinity Stone that had been in the Orb with a grinning troll doll. Yondu had payback in mind when he sold his services to the Sovereigns, but then everything went sideways for him. Nevertheless, once Rocket, Baby Groot, and he escape, they eliminate their adversaries.The major revelation of the 'Guardians' sequel concerns the character of Ego. Kurt Russel looks like he had a blast playing this imperious Celestial being who is a manifestation of a psychedelic planet that Ego created for himself. Basically, he is an amoral deity who behaves like the Greek god Zeus. During their brief stint on the planet, Peter and Ego begin on friendly terms until Ego slips up and reveals something terrible that alienates Peter. With its sumptuous CGI of alien galaxies and landscapes, 'GoTG, Vol. 2' looks a hundred times better visually than its predecessor. If you enjoyed the greatest hits music in the original film, the sequel serves up even more memorable pop tunes and incorporates them into the psychology of the plot, too! As the fifteenth entry in the Marvel Comics Cinematic Universe, the tongue-in-cheek 'Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2' ranks as one of the best.",10,2,7,29 June 2017
In Time," Time Out for Exposition
","Good science fiction films can get away with virtually anything except for shoddy storytelling. Okay, fantasy and horror movies can get away with just as many things. Indeed, sci-fi, fantasy, and horror movies aren't subject to the same laws of gravity as crime thrillers, war epics, westerns, soap operas, and similar films. Indeed, most movies must toe the line where realism is concerned, but realism largely optional in bad movies. The exception to the rule for all movies is credibility. If a movie is going to qualify as exemplary, it must possess credibility. Good sci-fi can create worlds beyond our own, but only if the filmmakers can make everything believable. Good sci-fi can contrive a race of entities which may share few human similarities. Consider the 'Planet of the Apes' film franchise as an example of good sci-fi. Often, however, these hybrid human and alien epics turn into mash-ups: humans working with or against extraterrestrials. Of course, the thematic as well as allegorical possibilities in these sci-fi films surpass anything that a regular film can conjure up. The point is that good sci-fi must strive even harder to make an imaginary environment with a laundry list of do's and don'ts seen credible so that the writers can justify getting their heroes and heroines in and out of life and death predicaments.'Gattaca' writer & director Alex Niccol has dreamed up a compelling premise for 'In Time,' starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried as a 'Bonnie & Clyde' couple on the lam from the law in the year 2161 where time is money. Unfortunately, Niccol fails to forge an aura of credibility for his 'Twilight Zone' tale. Specifically, Niccol neglects to provide enough information about the future. Mind you, nothing about 'In Time' seems far-fetched except for the rules that govern the economy of this enigmatic society. Nevertheless, this fascinating but flawed actioneer looks incredibly cool thanks to the stark looking widescreen cinematography of 'Brazil' lenser Roger Deakins, Alex McDowell's atmospheric production designs, and the minimalist art direction of Priscilla Elliot who designed 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.' Of course, Niccol and company have taken advantage of the historic Depression era architecture of Los Angeles with its art deco bridges, storefronts, and concrete river to supplement the film's mystique.Scientists have engineered a procedure--which Niccol never adequately explains--to genetically alter humans so they cease aging after age 25. Essentially, a man's wife, daughter, sister, mother, or aunt may be twice as old or young, but they never look a day over 25. Meanwhile, they are born with a thirteen-digit, Day-Glo green clock on the outside of their left forearm which counts down the time they have left. After reaching the age of 25, they have one year to live. Anybody who can acquire enough time can live to be immortal. Few, however, manage this feat. Once a person runs out of time, they fall dead on the spot. Meantime, everything is purchased according to time. For example, a cup of coffee costs four minutes, while an exotic convertible may cost 59 months. A phone call costs one minute. Interestingly, cell phones are non-existent. By this time, you must have figured out that the wealthy people are those with time to burn, while the poor folks spend their days toiling in dead-end jobs so they can earn time. Society has been stratified and rarified into the rich, the not-as rich, and the proletarian poor. People live in different time zones, and the least fortunate live in ghettos. Crossing from one time zone to another can be incredibly expensive. Things really get complicated because the economy keeps changing so that the poor have to work twice as hard to stay alive for the next 24 hours. This is the way this society deals with the threat of overpopulation. In this respect, 'In Time' mirrors contemporary society where prices escalate at the whim of greedy Wall Street traders who have no compassion.Our blue-collar protagonist, Will Salas (Justin Timberlake of 'The Social Network'), is just another face in an overcrowded ghetto. As a factory worker, he struggles to make his quota. One day, he encounters a suicidal guy in a neighborhood bar, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomber of 'Flightplan'), and saves him from the villainous Fortis (Alex Pettyfer of 'Beastly') and his gun-toting henchmen. Fortis and company cruise the ghetto searching for easy prey. Everybody keeps the clock on their forearms covered for safety reasons. Hamilton neither dresses nor behaves like the poor, and Fortis targets him. Will helps Hamilton to elude Fortis. Ironically, Hamilton has lived over a thousand years but has grown weary of life. He wants to die. While Salas and he are hiding out, Hamilton gives him a century of free time. Hamilton sneaks away and dives off a bridge. A squad of Timekeepers clad in long, leather coats, led by gimlet-eyed Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy of 'Batman Begins'), suspect Will may have murdered Hamilton.Eventually, the Timekeepers catch up with Will after he has crossed over several time zones. He has met and gambled with a wealthy citizen, Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser of 'Alpha Dog'), and won a fortune in time from him. Philippe's beautiful daughter Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried of 'Momma Mia!'), invites Will to their palatial residence to so her father can win back his lost time. Leon shows up and arrests Will, but our hero escapes and takes Sylvia as his hostage. Before long, Sylvia rebels against not only her wealthy father but also the injustice of the system. She joins Will on a crime spree stealing time. Basically, Will and she behave like 'Robin Hood' bandits. They threaten to destabilize the economy because they are giving time away to the less fortunate.Sadly, despite its provocative premise, 'In Time' generates little suspense and few surprises. Altogether, the scarcity of expository information about the future is enough to tick anybody off who demands a modicum of credibility.",5,2,6,26 November 2011
Thor," Boy Gets Hammer, Loses Hammer, & Then Gets Hammer Back Saga
","Although the newest addition to the Marvel Comics' cinematic super hero pantheon boasts polished production values and a charismatic cast, 'Hamlet' director Kenneth Branagh's 'Thor' qualifies as business as usual. This preposterous, larger-than-life, 115-minute, PG-13 rated opus shifts scenes between contemporary New Mexico and the fabled realm of Asgard where Norse royalty reside in opulent splendor. 'Agent Cody Banks' scenarists Ashley Edward Miller & Zack Stentz along with 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer' scribe Don Payne gave 'Thor' their best shot based on a story by 'Ninja Assassin' scenarist J. Michael Straczynski and 'Poseidon' writer Mark Protosevich. Despite those best efforts, 'Thor' amounts to a standard-issue 'origins' epic about Odin's arrogant offspring. No surprises lurk in this predictable, but sometimes amusing epic about the hammer wielding Norse champion. Basically, 'Thor' boils down to a boy-gets-hammer, boy-loses-hammer, and boy-gets-hammer back adventure. During this lukewarm lark, our hero acquaints himself with the meaning of humility after his stern father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has banished him from his own celestial kingdom. Handsome Aussie stud Chris Hemsworth, cast as Captain Kirk's father in the 'Star Trek' reboot, provides the appropriate brawn and blond hair as the eponymous hero afflicted with anger management issues. Mind you, the real Thor of lore possessed red hair and a red beard. Meantime, Academy Award winning actress Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgård enliven the Earth scenes, while Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins lords it over the Asgard scenes as the one-eyed Odin. Eventually, Thor and leading lady Jane gravitate to each other, but the film dwells on family woes more than romantic woo.'Thor' opens in Puente Antiguo, New Mexico. Astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman of 'Black Swan'), her mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård of 'Good Will Hunting'), and their wiseacre assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings of 'Defendor') are in the middle of nowhere at night searching for an atmospheric anomaly. Foster collides with somebody when they plunge into a storm-like phenomena. Before we discover who they've struck, the plot propels us back in time to Norway in 965 A.D. Odin has triumphed over the evil Frost Giants, led by King Laufey (Colm Feore of 'Chicago'), in a war to thwart them from conquering Earth. Odin loses an eye and exiles these icy blue bastards to their frozen world of Jotunheim. Furthermore, Odin confiscates the Casket of Ancient Winters that serves as their source of power. Later, as Odin is about to crown Thor, some Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and try to recover the casket. Although Odin dismisses the attempt as a botched effort, Thor wants to wage war on the Frost Giants. Odin and he resort to name-calling, and then Thor with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston of 'Midnight in Paris') and a quartet of his warrior comrades storm Jotunheim. When Odin learns about Thor's insubordination, he banishes his son to Earth. Thor is hurled into a 'Stargate' wormhole and hits planet Earth about the same time that Jane slams into him with her vehicle.As superhero movies go, nobody is ever in genuine jeopardy. The combat scenes generate little tension or suspense. Sure, several characters have some close scrapes with death, but nobody dies. Worse, some characters can get away with more than others because Branagh and his writers don't make us privy to their special powers. Watch Loki and you'll see. As villains rate, Loki doesn't amount to much more than a trickster, and Thor never performs anything incredibly cool, like the heroes in 'Iron Man,' 'The Incredible Hulk,' and 'The Fantastic Four.' Specifically, the villains don't pose much of a threat to Jane and her friends.The chief problem with 'Thor' is the less-than-gripping scripting. If you're a fan of the original Marvel Comics 'Thor' from 1962, the Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne version shares little in common with 'Journey into Mystery' #83. Donald Blake is mentioned a few times in the film. In the comic book, Blake discovered a wooden staff. When he smashed it against a rock, the staff became 'Mjolnir.' Miller, Stentz, and Payne dispense with the usual human who masquerades as a superhero, and pick up the thread of the 'Thor' comics from later incarnations. Unlike most Marvel Comics where the hero suffers from a fatal flaw, Thor has nothing comparable outside of his anger management issues. Once he finds himself separated from his supernatural hammer, he calms down enough to get it back, but he doesn't have to endure much suffering until then. Anybody who can catch 'Thor' in 2-D will enjoy the experience much more than the 3-D version. As it turns out, 'Thor' was photographed in 2-D and then converted to 3-D. Not once do you see Thor hurl his celebrated hammer 'Mjolnir' at the camera. Indeed, nothing in the 3-D 'Thor' flies out at you. More fly-in-your face gimmicks would have bolstered the action quotient of this lackluster effort. Nevertheless, the other special effects are beyond reproach. The otherworldly utopia that constitutes Asgard is a mixture of 'Men-in-Black' production designer Bo Welch, 'Sleuth' costume designer Alexandra Byrne and 'Mamma Mia!' lenser Haris Zambarloukos. Asgard is a visual treat if you like edifices that resemble organ pipes. The African-American sentry guarding the Bifrost, Heimdall (Idris Elba of 'Takers'), seems a little incongruous, but then we live in politically enlightened times. The same holds true for one of Thor's best buddies, Hogun (Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano), who is clearly Asian. Marvel movie fans will be happy to know S.H.I.E.L.D's Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) from the 'Iron Man' films reprises his role. Natalie Portman has little to do but slam her vehicle into our hero. The best parts of 'Thor' take place on Earth and the fish-out-of-water story with Thor tangling with modern-day life provides the primary source of comic relief. Altogether, 'Thor' could have been more.",5,1,5,20 May 2011
The Happening," 'The Happening' is Utter Hokum!
","Since he made the ghost story movie 'The Sixth Sense' with Bruce Willis back in 1999, writer & director M. Night Shyamalan has displayed a penchant for creating movies with paranoia, suspense, and surprises. 'Unbreakable,' Shyamalan's sophomore effort with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, generated equal amounts of paranoia, suspense, and surprises, but nothing that topped 'The Sixth Sense.' Despite contrived scripting, Shyamalan's third epic 'Signs,' a science fiction saga about aliens invading Earth with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, illustrated him at his zenith for forging paranoia, suspense, and surprises. Shyamalan botched his fourth film 'The Village,' starring Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and William Hurt. This xenophobic parable about a faction of people that isolates themselves from society lacked the supernatural elements of 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Unbreakable,' and 'Signs.' Shyamalan loves to spring surprises on his audience, but 'The Village' felt like he had yanked the rug out from under moviegoers. An atrociously cheesy ending undercut its paranoia, suspense, and surprises. Shyamalan recovered with 'Lady in the Water,' a lightweight fantasy thriller about a misplaced water nymph from a bedtime story. She winds up stranded in a contemporary apartment complex swimming pool and the maintenance man (Paul Giamatti) has to solve riddles to get her safely back to her own kind. Whatever ground Shyamalan regained with 'Lady in the Water,' he has forfeited with his latest exercise in paranoia, suspense, and surprises in his new movie 'The Happening' with Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, and John Leguizamo. 'The Happening' is only a third as good as 'Signs.' 'The Happening' unfolds in New York City at Central Park around 8 AM. Inexplicably, everybody in the park stops walking. Some begin to walk backwards after a moment. A girl on a park bench perusing a book pauses, pulls a metal pin out of her hair and plunges it into her throat. Less than an hour later, a worker hurls himself off a high-rise building under construction. As co-workers gather around his body, they glance up. More construction workers are diving to their deaths off the building. TV newscasts carry reports that an unknown airborne chemical virus has swept New York City and people are committing suicide. Authorities prepare to evacuate the Big Apple while they speculate about the source of the virus. Initially, they blame terrorists for the attack.Meanwhile, Philadelphia high school scientist teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg of 'Shooter') tells his class that honey bees have vanished without a trace. He asks them to account for this phenomenon. One student believes the disappearance of the honey bees is 'an act of nature that we will never understand.' Elliot agrees. Scientists will theorize about the loss of the honey bees, he asserts, but nobody will know conclusively why the bees went bye-bye. Writer & director M. Night Shyamalan has thus laid the ground work for 'The Happening.' Mysterious events nobody can explain jeopardize civilization. Like hundreds of other people, Elliot, his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel of 'Elf'), his colleague Julian (John Leguizamo of 'Spawn') and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez of 'Crash') catch an Amtrak passenger train leaving Philadelphia. The train halts in a small town because the train employees say that they 'lost contact' and everybody is set afoot. Television news reports reveal that the deadly airborne virus has spread across entire northeast. About that time one of the evacuees that our heroes are fleeing with devises a theory for the virus that sounds like the ravings of a lunatic. Elliot, however, believes that man's theory and suggests that Alma and he separate from the main body of people.'The Happening' develops loads of paranoia, suspense, and surprises during its first hour. Unfortunately, it blows it all for a revelation about the airborne virus that would make global warming champs cheer Shyamalan. Unless somebody has told you what triggered the apocalyptic virus which compels people to commit suicide, you will want to laugh out loud. 'The Happening' is a horror movie with no tangible horror. Unlike like previous Shyamalan sagas, this sci-fi thriller has moments of gore and violence that drive home the lethal impact of the virus. Hollywood has made horror movies about virtually every known or unknown supernatural catastrophe that has threatened mankind, but 'The Happening' has an invisible nemesis that you can only hear and then suspect the worst consequences. Shyamalan dissipates the suspense and paranoia suddenly when the virus loses potency without warning. 'The Happening' qualifies as an inept B-movie horror thriller that refuses to divulge the source of its mystery because it has no answers.",4,7,13,26 June 2008
The Shape of Water," A Creature Feature Romance
","Imagine the Universal Pictures' horror classic 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' (1954) revamped as a romantic escapade, and you'll have some idea what to expect from 'Hellboy' helmer Guillermo del Toro's supernatural saga 'The Shape of Water,' starring Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Shannon. Doug Jones plays an enigmatic humanoid amphibian from the Amazon who walks upright on two legs. Equipped with gills and face like C3p0, he lands in the hands of the U.S. Government. 'The Shape of Water' takes place in 1961 during the early years of the Space Race between Uncle Sam and the Soviet Union. Unlike the reptilian 'Black Lagoon Creature,' this gill guy wouldn't frighten a fly, though he does use his large, webbed hands with claws to tear a couple of fingers off his sadistic human curator. Later, he munches on the head of a contentious cat. Scrambling to launch a man into space, the U.S. Government believes this creature will provide them with answers to questions about human survival in space. Basically, this fable concerns an oversized lab specimen and the heartless abuse that his captors inflict on him with Nazi-like relish for their research. Mind you, Hollywood has made movies comparable to 'The Shape of Water,' such as 'Splice' (2009), about a lab specimen that unscrupulous researchers concocted from a genetic crucible and then learned they couldn't control it. The humanoid amphibian here isn't as treacherous as the feminine hybrid in 'Splice' or the 'Species' (1995) franchise. Indeed, 'The Shape of Water' creature is altogether sympathetic, and del Toro's relies on imagery designed to win our sympathy-particularly when it is chained up in a way reminiscent of the 'Frankenstein' monster. A huge metal shackle surrounds its neck while a spider-web of chain links hold it down to a huge circular pad. Nevertheless, despite a few scenes where the villain gouges it with an electric cattle prod, 'The Shape of Water' focuses on a mute cleaning lady at the top-secret complex who falls in love with it and yearns to free it. When it doesn't remind you of 'Creature from the Black Lagoon,' del Toro's winsome yarn evokes memories of 'Beauty and the Beast.' Mind you, occasionally things happen that may confound audiences, but 'The Shape of Water' is ostensibly a love story that indulges in surrealism without rubbing your face in its less savory moments. No, it isn't surprising that del Toro co-wrote and directed this fanciful epic. After all, he was responsible for 'Hellboy' (2004) and 'Hellboy: The Golden Army.' 
 
Korean War veteran Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon of 'Man of Steel') has captured an anonymous amphibian during a South American safari, and General Hoyt (Nick Searcy of 'The Fugitive') wants a team of scientists to slice it up to see if they can duplicate its ability to live in different environments. Strickland serves as a sadistic jailor who terrorizes the amphibian with an electric cattle prod. He enjoys wreaking pain on it, especially after it rips off two of his fingers. This amphibian is imprisoned at a top-secret government research facility where Elisa Esposito (British actress Sally Hawkins of 'Blue Jasmine') works as a cleaning lady. Elisa's best friend, Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer of 'The Help'), does her talking for her, because Elisa is mute and can only communicate with sign language. Elisa feels sad about the way the creature is mistreated. She displays compassion for it, feeding it hard-boiled eggs and playing music for it on her portable record player. The amphibian reciprocates her kindness. Moreover, the creature seems to fathom sign language, and the two become friends. Eventually, the scientists realize the only way to exact the secrets of the gill man's mysterious corporeal being is to perform an autopsy on it. Predictably, Elisa cannot let this unspeakable act transpire so she exploits her knowledge of the security measures, and plots an escape plan. She finds an unlikely ally in the form of another scientist, Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg of 'Doctor Strange'), who argues killing the amphibian is the worst thing that they can do for their research. While he is sympathetic to the plight of the creature, Hoffstetler has his own subversive reasons for not destroying it. Meantime, Zelda has no idea that Elisa has become so inextricably enamored of the creature. Initially, Elisa doesn't want to involve Zelda in the escape. Instead, she enlists her next-door neighbor, a lonely artist, Giles (Richard Jenkins of 'Me, Myself & Irene'), to help her undertake this spine-tingling caper. Hoffstetler throws in with them and furnishes a vital distraction guaranteed to make the escape a surefire success. 
 
Guillermo del Toro orchestrates several white-knuckled sequences during the breakout that will put you on the edge of your seat. However, it isn't so much the way he stages 'The Shape of Water' that makes it memorable, but the gallery of characters that he spends a little more than two hours creating until we either love them or hate them. Elisa lives in her own fantasy world above a movie theater, and she has a dull, drab existence until she encounters this strange amphibian and tenders her love to it. Shrewdly, del Toro and 'Divergent' scenarist Vanessa Taylor make the characters as strong a story element as the predicament in which the amphibian finds itself. All good adventure outings require a dangerous antagonist, and Mike Shannon does a fantastic job making Richard Strickland a thoroughly obnoxious dastard. Nevertheless, they don't skimp on his character. The subplots involving Strickland's purchase of a 1962 Cadillac and his marriage are hilarious. Even peripheral characters, like General Hoyt, stand out. Unfortunately, gifted as she is, Oscar-winning Octavia Spencer appears to have been cast primarily because she played in 'The Help,' and del Toro and Taylor exploit this advantage in amusing little ways. Unquestionably, 'The Shape of Water' is as implausibly preposterous but entertaining as the 2006 M. Night Shyamalan fantasy 'The Lady in the Water.'",8,23,43,31 December 2017
Zombieland," A Good Zombie Comedy Thriller
","Watching freshman director Ruben Fleischer's audacious but entertaining lowbrow horror movie/road comedy 'Zombieland' reminded me of author Max Brooks' tongue-in-cheek manual 'Zombie Survival Guide' about surviving a zombie apocalypse. Brooks establishes the difference between 'Solanum' zombies—zombies spawned by a virus--as opposed to voodoo zombies, along with helpful tips to outwit a zombie. Remember, zombies are reanimated corpses or a mindless human being. Despite their complete lack of intellect, zombies compensate with violent, uncontrollable behavior. For example, Brooks recommends that you keep your hair trimmed so a zombie cannot seize you by your locks and take a chunk out of you. Incidentally, the zombies in 'Zombieland' qualify as 'Solanum' zombies. Radioactive fall-out didn't create them like the zombies in director George Romeo's touchstone 1968 horror picture 'Night of the Living Dead.' Scenarists Rhett Reese of 'Clifford's Really Big Movie' and television scribe Paul Wernick have forged a formulaic, uneven two-star road picture. Nothing occurs here that you haven't seen in any other z-movie. Blood, gore, and guts constitute an integral part of the action, but 'Zombieland' is rarely frightening. Think of it more as a young, steroid Woody Allen meets 'The Road Warrior' in a Looney Tunes comedy about zombies run amok. Meanwhile, the scenarists' attention to characterization, dialogue and the humor ranks as four stars. A virulent strain of mad cow disease precipitated the zombie epidemic. A college student from Austin, Texas (Jesse Eisenberg of 'The Hunting Party') has managed to survive the zombie holocaust. He is driving back to Columbus, Ohio, to visit his parents. The trouble is that he doesn't know if his parents are alive. Our protagonist is also somewhat of a modern-day, urban hermit who doesn't venture out that often and prefers to play video games. As the narrator, he dictates his laundry list survival rules. First, 'cardio' heads the list. You've got to be faster on your feet than the zombies chasing you. Our narrator informs us that the fat humans were the first to die. Second, he advocates the 'double tap' rule. Shoot each zombie twice to make sure that zombie is kaput. Third, he warns us that restrooms have ceased to be havens of privacy. Somehow, zombies learned that they could corner their helpless prey in a toilet stall. Fourth, you must always wear seat belts, because you will survive a car collision and the zombies will not. Fleischer takes these first four rules and demonstrates each in the gas station/parking lot scene as our hero tries to elude three zombies. Fleischer renders each rule in visual text graphics like something out of 'Fight Club.' Later, our hero meets an older guy in a Cadillac truck with a bulldozer scoop on the grille. The older guy agrees to give the kid a lift, but he doesn't want to know his name. Instead, they refer to themselves by their destinations. Columbus is going to see his parents, while Tallahassee is searching for the last Twinkie in America. They cruise the accident cluttered four-lanes of a destitute land until they run into two females. These gals are sisters, and Tallahassee nicknames them Wichita (Emma Stone of 'Superbad') and the girl Little Rock (Abigail Breslin of 'Signs'). No sooner have our heroes met the heroines than they pull a fast one on Columbus and Tallahassee and steal their truck and their arsenal. Predictably, our heroes go after them. Wichita and Little Rock are bound for a California amusement park called Pacific Playland where there are reportedly no zombies. You can guess what greets them when they wheel into Pacific Playland. Despite the overall predictable plot, 'Zombieland' still serves up some thrills and chills. Primarily, this movie succeeds as a release valve for anti-social behavior. The humans kill the zombies with no more thought to their demise than if they were playing a first-person, shooter video game. They destroy stores as if they were vandals. Having Bill Murry around, playing himself in a cameo, is simply genius. Woody Harrelson of 'Natural Born Killers' and 'Adventureland's' Jesse Eisenberg develop a rapport with each other that makes them seem believable despite their differences in age and intellect. People who cannot stomach the blood and gore of a standard zombie movie may not survive 'Zombieland.' Although the film carries an R-rating, director Ruben Fleischer doesn't try to gross you out like he could have. He shuns close-up shots of zombies dining on road kill. When he does show a road kill munching zombie, Fleischer relies on humor to underwhelm the horror. The zombies of 'Zombieland' are fairly typical. They attack fearlessly in mobs with nothing on their minds but killing people and gnawing the flesh from their bones. These zombies all appear basically alike. They are easy to spot since they are in some stage of physical decomposition, with rotting flesh, tarnished eyes, and gaping wounds. Unlike traditional 'Night of the Living Dead' zombies, they can scramble across open ground like an aggressive football team. Zombies of the fleet feet variety first showed up in the 1980 Italian gore fest 'Nightmare City.' Fleischer films the first encounter between Columbus and Tallahassee as if he were shooting a Spaghetti western with the appropriate south-of-the-border favor music. The most suspense that he can milk out of the material is the climactic showdown in the amusement park when our heroines are trapped on a drop tower ride.",8,1,4,11 October 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Nothing Short of Superb!!!
","Producer & director Frank Capra's crowning glory 'It's A Wonderful Life' (1946) with James Stewart and Donna Reed ranks as one of the greatest Hollywood movies. This warm-hearted epic about life in the small town of Bedford Falls and protagonist George Bailey (James Stewart) and his eternal battle with the corrupt and evil Potter (Lionel Barrymore) captures the spirit of America after the end of World War II. A box office flop, 'It's A Wonderful Life' acquired a new lease on life when copyright holders National Telefilm Associates neglected to renew it in 1973. Consequently, television stations ran it ad nauseam until Republic Pictures renewed the copyright in the 1990s. Everybody considers Capra's film an example of the classic Christmas movie, but Christmas doesn't play a part in the plot until more than half way through it. George Bailey epitomizes optimism and plans to break out of the confinement of rural America to globe trot around the world until events larger than he compels him to remain in Bedford Falls.After his long-suffering father dies, George steps into the breach and continues his age-old struggle against the greedy Potter and he triumphs in the end. Winning, however, isn't a picnic for our hometown hero. George Bailey comes mighty close to losing. At one point, he contemplates suicide when the bank examiner arrives at his savings and loan office and poor Uncle Billy (Oscar winner Thomas Mitchell) has lost $8-thousand dollars. Capra and scenarists Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Jo Swerling, working from an original story by Philip Van Doren Stern, paint our hero into a corner when Uncle Billy lost $8-thousand dollars when he encounter the despicable Potter in the bank. Of course, Potter kept the money that poor Uncle Billy inadvertently handed to him in a folded up newspaper. At this point, fearing scandal, prison, and humiliation, George got drunk, slammed his ancient automobile into a tree, and wandered onto a bridge where he contemplated suicide. Mind you, Potter put the idea into George's head when George turned in desperation to Potter for a loan to cover his shortfall of cash. At this point, an angel second class without wings, Clarence (Henry Travers of 'Shadow of a Doubt'), is dispatched from Heaven to save George. When George mentions that he wished that he had never been born, Clarence comes up with the imaginative idea of showing George what Bedford Falls would be like if George had never been born! George is shocked not only when he notes that the town is now called Pottersville but also that his brother died in an ice-skating accident. Earlier, George had saved his younger brother's life when the latter fell through thin ice and nearly drowned. George is so horrified by everything that he sees that he decides that he'd rather be born so he can face the music. As Capra has said himself in interviews about 'It's A Wonderful Life,' he describes it as a celebration of the individual. Basically, one man can make a difference in this world.Naturally, for George's sake, he receives a second chance. Meaning, 'It's A Wonderful Life' is a life-affirming movie.",10,4,8,21 December 2014
Enemy at the Gates," World War II Told From A Soviet Perspective
","Watching 'Quest for Fire' director Jean-Jacques Annaud's World War II spectacle 'Enemy at the Gates' reminded me of the 'Sgt. Rock' comic books that I used to peruse as an adolescent when I was growing up in Mississippi during the Cold War years of the 1960s. Those fiendishly duplicitous Nazis in 'Sgt Rock' always set up ingenious ambushes, concealing themselves in places where the unsuspecting American G.I.s would least expect to spot them, such as either disabled tanks or the rubble of fallen buildings. 'Enemy at the Gates' keeps that Nazi skullduggery intact. Although French director Annaud, whose credits include 'Seven Years in Tibet' and 'In the Name of the Rose,' condemns the Nazi, he goes to heavy-handed lengths near the end to rekindle our antipathy to National Socialism. You'll know the scene when you see it. I hate movie critics would give away too much of a movie plot.Anyway, the aristocratic Nazi Major Konig (Ed Harris of 'Stepmom') dispatched to kill our heroic Red Army sniper disguises a department store mannequin in a gray Wehrmacht uniform with a rifle. Talk about symbolism!? Weren't the Wehrmacht supposed to be the good guys, and the Nazis the evil villains? Although this large-scale, $80 million, World War II epic glorifies the marksmanship of real-life Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law of 'Cold Mountain') who bagged 300 Germans, Annaud condemns the Soviet ideology that Vassili defended. At the same time, no matter how magnificent the set design, costume design, and overall production of the film remains, 'Enemy at the Gates' is painfully predictable, though far better than its American counterpart 'Saving Private Ryan.' Indeed, while both films feature snipers, 'Enemy' achieves far greater realism and far less sentimental loquacity than Steven Spielberg's highly-overrated D-Day saga. Nevertheless, 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Enemy at the Gates' both celebrate the supremacy of the individual.Anybody that marches into 'Enemy at the Gates' with the impression that the Nazis will triumph is hopelessly naïve, so Annaud's cinematic strategy of making this movie into a cat-and-mouse duel between sympathetic snipers falters in the last half-hour when the Nazi foe unveils his murderous colors. Ultimately, 'Enemy' shares more in common ideologically with director Howard Hawk's patriotic 1941 film biography about World War I Tennessee sharpshooter Alvin York in 'Sergeant York.' York captured hundreds of German troops single-handedly by using his sniping skills in World War I. Warner Brothers produced 'Sergeant York' during the tumultuous days of 1941 to drum up patriotism among Americans and give them somebody to emulate. Similarly, Vassili rise to prominence as a Red Army war hero occurs when a young Communist political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes of 'Elizabeth' and 'Shakespeare in Love') suggests the way to inspire morale during among the infantry is to reinvent Vassili Zaitsev as a hero for the army to worship. One of the problems about being a film critic and film lover is that you spot some things that nobody else would care about, like Danilov's 'Battleship Potemkin' eyewear. Real cute, Jean-Jacques.Anybody that has read anything about the brutal battle of Stalingrad in 1942 knows that it emerges as one of the savage battles of all time. Imagine Dante's 'Inferno' as the genuine article, and you have a fair idea how devastating the fighting was. 'Enemy's' opening scenes show literally thousands of young Soviet troops piling aboard filthy railroad cattle cars and freighted to the war-ravaged city on the Volga where most would die. As 'Enemy' unfolds, our protagonist, young Vassili Zaitsev, finds himself among scores of comrades as their officers issue rifles to every other soldier while those soldiers-in-between receive a mere magazine clip of bullets. Basically, the Soviets hurled more men into combat than they had rifles to arm! Sounds rather anti-Soviet to me. If an individual survived, he had to participate in the gory art of battlefield salvage. In other words, taking rifles off the dead! Anyway, Vassili charges off courageously into the fray with a fistful of bullets and bides his time until he can acquire a rifle. ('Enemy' loves to flashback to childhood memories of Vassili in the snowy Urals lining up a wolf in the cross-hairs as it attacks a staked out horse. The outcome of this flashback is pretty predictable, too.) Meanwhile, Soviet officers gun down without qualm any infantrymen that retreat from the Nazi horde. Neither side emerges from 'Enemy' as white-washed as the American G.I.s in 'Saving Private Ryan.' The Soviets aren't quite as diabolical as the Nazis. After all, remember who won World War II. When we first meet Comrade Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins of 'The Long Good Friday'), he forces a high-ranking Soviet general to commit suicide because he cannot repel the Nazi invaders. Usually, this scene appears in only Nazi war movies where suicide is deemed the simple way out.Basically, 'Enemy' chronicles not only the cat-and-mouse showdown between Nazi Major Konig and Vassili, but also a love triangle with Vassili, Danilov, and a beautiful Jewish girl, Tanya (Rachel Weisz of 'The Mummy') whose parents died at the hands of the Nazis. Indeed, Annaud manages successfully to blow soap bubbles amid bullets. Imagine 'Jules and Jim' in Stalingrad and you know what to expect. The outcome is a predictable as who survives the duel, but Annaud gives it the kind of noble gravity that it requires to rupture your tear ducts.Guys who like war movies where you can see authentic vintage bombers dropping loads on the battleground, especially the Junkers 87, aka 'Stuka' dive-bombers, will love this war movie despite its romantic interludes. Had Annaud gone against the grain on certain plot elements and characters, 'Enemy at the Gates' might have qualified as a contemporary classic.",8,1,3,18 June 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Just Another Mediocre Matrimonial Melodrama
","The new Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie romantic thriller comedy 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' blends bits and pieces from the 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot'em up 'True Lies' and the 1989 Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner domestic black comedy 'The War of the Roses' to tell the often amusing but sometimes violent saga about an alienated married couple who try to knock each other off. Director Doug Liman, who helmed 'The Bourne Identity,' 'Swingers,' and 'Go,' doesn't break any new ground with this mindless kiss-kiss/bang-bang potboiler, but he keeps the far-fetched action moving at a fast enough pace that you don't worry about the weaknesses in Simon Kinberg's hopelessly outlandish screenplay. Neither the explosive firefight sequences can compare with Liman's earlier spy thriller 'The Bourne Identity' nor does the humor rival either of his previous comedies 'Swingers' and 'Go.' Nevertheless, the sexy on-screen chemistry between Pitt and Jolie as well as Vince Vaughn's hilarious scene-stealing antics as a hit-man who lives with his mom make 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' worth watching once, even when everybody isn't trying to blow more holes in each other than a wedge of Swiss cheese. Incidentally, for the record, aside from its title, Liman's 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' shares nothing in common with Alfred Hitchcock's one and only screwball comedy 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' (1941) that toplined Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery.'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' opens with Jane (Angelina Jolie of 'Alexander') and John Smith (Brad Pitt of 'Troy') seated in separate chairs as they answer a variety of questions from an anonymous, off-screen marriage counselor (voice of William Fichtner of 'The Longest Yard') about the length of their wedlock, where they met, and how often they have sex. During their martial therapy sessions, Jane and John break the fourth wall. In other words, they address all their responses to us—the audience--as if we were the therapist. You cannot watch these scenes—all action occurs in flashbacks--without thinking about the infamous, off-screen meltdown of Brad Pitt's own marriage to actress Jennifer Aniston. Unless you've lived in a cave for the last year or kept your eyes shut while standing in the check out lanes at Walmart where the tabloids proclaim that Pitt cheated with Jolie, you know what I'm talking about. Director Doug Liman relies on this clever framing gimmick to tell us that neither Jane nor John is happily married. John claims that they have been married for five years, but Jane contradicts him they have been hitched for six years. We learn that our heroes met in Bogotá, Columbia, where they had carried out respective assassinations, then paired up to throw the local constabulary off the scent. The law is out to round up all singles, so our heroes lie and say they are a couple. What difference should it make whether assassins are single or come in pairs is never explained? Furthermore, we learn that they spend more time apart from each other than with each other. Their time together isn't any rosier. They quarrel about the new curtains that Jane has brought for their luxurious home in suburbia. Jane works for a Wall Street firm, while John runs an engineering business with best buddy, wisecracking Eddie (an unshaven Vince Vaughn of 'Swingers'). In reality, Jane and John work for different assassination agencies. She stashes her arsenal of automatic weapons and throwing knives in a compartment inside and beneath the oven, while he hides his hardware underneath the garage. Neither has the faintest notion what the other does, because neither intrudes on each other at their respective workplaces. Eventually, the competing agencies that hire them to make hits accidentally double-book a hit. The target escapes their gun sites, because Jane and John wind up shooting at each other. When our protagonists discover that they have been exchanging shots, they start blasting away at each other in what constitutes the most unusual way to remodel their home.Absurd as it may seem, scenarist Simon Kinberg penned his exercise in weapons-toting, one-upmanship as part of his thesis for his Masters of Fine Arts degree at Columbia University. Naturally, a squad of uncredited scribes rewrote it for the big-screen, but the problem is that neither Liman nor his writers can make up their minds about what kind of movie that they wanted to make. Some of the action gets pretty brutal for the PG-13 rating, while at other times the gunfights resemble kung fu battles with our outnumbered heroes repulsing literally hundreds of expendable SWAT team clad assassins. If you've seen the trailer for 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' you have already caught a glimpse of the best scenes: the interior redecorating scene between Pitt and Jolie; the desert shoot'em up, and the hell-for-leather chase scene. 'Mr.& Mrs. Smith' gets off to a slow start as Liman sets up their martial woes, but he never goes very deep into the action itself. Since we know that neither Jane nor John is going to kill each other, suspense takes a back seat. Moreover, we have no villain at which to vent our rage. The one-liners are witty in a James Bond sense. Jane blows up the elevator that she has John trapped in, and he accused her of giving him the shaft. Repeatedly, other characters ridicule their marriage. During the guidance counseling scenes, John describes their life together as ' . . . a huge space filled with everything that we don't say to each other . . .' When John asks the therapist what he would call that, the therapist crisply replies: 'marriage.' 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' lacks any shred of either sentimentality or narrative depth. Guys should enjoy the over-the-top but unbelievable action scenes, while gals will find Jane's efforts to outsmart John in the kitchen, bedroom, and battlefield comical, too. Without the luminous chemistry of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' would qualify as just another mediocre matrimonial melodrama.",7,0,2,20 June 2007
The Departed," The Mean Streets of Boston
","Martin Scorsese's crime thriller 'The Departed' doesn't look like the typical Scorsese crime thriller because virtually everybody in it hasn't worked with him. This brilliant multi-faceted melodrama about the tooth and nail struggle to jail a well-known criminal boasts several surprises, primarily at the end and a number of sensational performances, with Jack Nicholson ably cast as Boston crime boss Frank Costello taking top honors. DeCaprio is cast as an undercover cop straight out of the academy who joins Costello's mob, while Costello grooms Matt Damon as his snitch inside the department. This cat & mouse thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat as one mole in the mob circles another mole in the police, and Scorsese and scenarist William Monahan patiently construct this elaborate complex thriller without wearing out their welcome. A must-see for die-hard Scorsese fans as much as crime movie fanatics!",10,1,1,20 December 2011
Die Hard," Top Notch Thriller
","Basically, 'Die Hard' is the movie that solidified Bruce Willis' dreams of super-stardom. Twenty five years later, Willis is still on top billed in most of his movies. This surefire Twentieth Century Fox franchise has yielded four sequels, including the latest 'A Good Day to Die Hard.' In the first film, Willis played a 'loose cannon' New York cop visiting California. He had been a member of the NYPD for eleven years when he flies out to see his wife, Holly, who works with a Japanese corporation at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles. He arrives for the Christmas Party, meets Holly, gets into an argument with her and then gets separated from the main party with his wife. Everybody is taken by surprise when a German terrorist and his minions storm the Nakatomi Towers. They take everybody hostage, but they slip up and miss John McClane. The terrorist leader, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman of 'Galaxy Quest'), wants to steal the $640 million in negotiable bearer bonds in Mr. Takagi's company safe. Along the way, Gruber has a person duel with our hard-headed hero. They chase him around the building and at one point, he wraps a fire hose around his waist and flies through a window with a machine gun in his fist sputtering rounds. This is one terrific actioneer.",10,1,1,14 February 2013
American Made," A First Rate, Real-Life Drug Smuggling Saga
","Doug Liman, the director of 'The Bourne Identity,' 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' and 'Edge of Tomorrow,' chronicles the rip-roaring, real-life exploits of good ole boy Barry Seal in 'American Made,' an exhilarating action-comedy, crime thriller that combines elements of the Mel Gibson epic 'Air America' (1990) and the 2015 Netflix series 'Narcos.' If you saw the first season of 'Narcos,' Barry Seal went out in a brief blaze of glory. At one time the youngest commercial airliner pilot for TWA, the Baton Rouge, Louisiana native got intertwined with the CIA, the DEA, Pablo Escobar and the murderous Medellín Cartel as well as the Reagan White House, and lived up to the image of 'a wild and crazy guy' before the Colombians finally snuffed him. Mind you, 'American Made' isn't the first time that Hollywood has depicted Seal's audacious antics. The late, great Dennis Hopper portrayed Seal in Roger Young's made-for-television docudrama 'Double-Crossed' (1991) with Danny Trejo. Later, Michael Paré had a supporting role as Barry Seal in Brad Furman's 'The Infiltrator' (2016) with Bryan Cranston as an undercover DEA agent. More recently, Dylan Bruno played Seal in an episode of 'Narcos.' Nevertheless, the charismatic Cruise delivers a broad, light-hearted performance as the amoral drug smuggling aviator in what amounts to a modern-day version of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' in the skies. Basically, as Barry Seal, Cruise dominates 'American Made' while other equally historic personages lurk on the periphery, including President Ronald Reagan and Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. Helming this entertaining, 115-minute, R-rated opus with a light touch, Liman doesn't subject audiences to the usual blood-splattered carnage that characterizes the typical cartel crime expose. Although 'Stash House' writer Gary Spinelli has altered the facts here and there to make Barry Seal appear more sympathetic, 'American Made' qualifies as one of the better cartel crime sagas which shows audiences that you cannot smuggle your cocaine and live to tell about it without the fatal consequences catching up with you.'American Made' opens with TWA pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise of 'Top Gun') flying passengers here, there, and everywhere, and growing bored and restless with being a just another pilot when he isn't smuggling Cuban cigars. In one scene, our prankster protagonist decides to wake up his serenely sleeping passengers as well as his snoozing co-pilot during a flight by switching off the auto-pilot and creating a little turbulence of his own. Eventually, weary of the predictable routine of shuttling passengers, Seal quits TWA just after his co-pilot and he complete their pre-flight checklist. Grabbing his gear, he exits the jetliner without a backward glance and goes off to work for an enigmatic guy named Monty 'Schafer' (Domhnall Gleeson of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens') who furnishes him a twin-engined aircraft and clearance to fly patriotic missions for the CIA. Initially, Seal refuses to let his sweet but superficial wife Lucy (Sarah Wright of 'The House Bunny') in on his new gig until he runs into trouble smuggling cocaine for Pablo Escobar. Colombian troops bust Escobar and his associates while Seal winds up in jail and loses a tooth until 'Schafer' shows up to bail him out. The catch is that Louisiana authorities will be knocking on his front door at dawn the following day if Seal doesn't uproot his family on a moment's notice and relocate them to Mena, Arkansas. Lucy goes reluctantly along with his harebrained scheme, and the police with their blue and red dome light flashing careen pass him on the way out of town. Talk about a cliffhanger escape! Barry finds himself running guns to Contras in Nicaragua for 'Schafer' when he isn't pausing in Panama to swap contraband with General Manuel Noriega (newcomer Alberto Ospino) or flying more cocaine into Louisiana for Pablo Escobar. Basically, as long as Seal flies for the CIA, the Agency doesn't care what he does on his own time. Furthermore, to protect their investment in his services, the CIA provide him with information so he can elude the DEA. Seal winds up hiring four other misfit pilots, and they outfly the DEA back and forth from Central and South America. The last thing our free-wheeling hero could ever imagine happening happens: he makes a ton of money but he doesn't have enough bank accounts and front companies to conceal it. Indeed, he buries so much cash on property that the CIA has given him that he has nowhere else to hide aside from stuffing in suitcases in his hanger. At this point, the devil enters paradise in the person of Lucy's sleazy younger brother J.B. (Caleb Landry Jones of 'X-Men: First Class'), who decides to take advantage of all those $100 bills cluttering up closets. Suddenly, not only do the authorities bust J.B., but the CIA decides to let the FBI, ATF, DEA, and the Arkansas State Police arrest him. In a last-ditch effort to save his wife and family, Seal agrees a mission for the White House and Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North to incriminate Pablo Escobar. Naturally, the Oval Office doesn't keep its end of the bargain.Despite its historical basis in 1970s and the 1980s, the last thing that director Doug Liman wants audiences to do is take Barry Seal seriously, and 'American Made' amounts to a nostalgic romp through headlines of the yesteryear. The excerpts from Ronald Reagan's Hollywood films as well as his White House press conference, featuring wife Nancy and her famous 'Just Say No to Drugs' quote are thoroughly hilarious. One of the funniest scenes shows Seal crash landing a plane crammed with cocaine in a suburban neighborhood. Stumbling out of the aircraft, our clownish hero emerges covered in cocaine. Dumping packets of $100 bills at the feet of a gawking teenager, Seal takes the kid's bike and pedals away before the DEA arrives. Rarely has twentieth century history been so nostalgic as 'American Made,' and Tom Cruise will keep you in stitches as a guy who leaped before he looked.",9,5,9,16 October 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Too Much Comic Relief Undercuts An Above-Average Sci-Fi Saga
","Too much comic relief undermines the dramatic impact of director Michael Bay's visually impressive sequel 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.' If you skipped the original live-action 'Transformers,' you may not understand the stakes in the sequel or the situation. The original concluded with the treacherous Decepticon jet Transformer streaking off into the sky, guaranteeing the survival of the villains. Original 'Transformer' scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are joined on this installment by 'Reindeer Games' writer Ehren Kruger and they bring back the evil Decepticons for a rematch with the virtuous Autobots. Clocking in at an hour and 49 minutes, Bay's epic length sequel features machine-like entities shape-shifting from various vehicles into gigantic robots with deadly appendages that discharge explosive broadsides whenever they unleash their titanic fury. The problem is Bay neglects the narrative for these massive transformations. When the Hasbro creations aren't changing from innocent machines into destructive robots, Bay and his scribes are slinging visual and verbal jokes as fast as you can blink. In other words, 'Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen' lacks suspense until the last quarter hour when the flesh & blood performers inject some emotional gravity into this superficial smackdown between good and evil alien robots.'Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen' opens with a prologue in 17,000 B.C. when mankind initially runs afoul of the alien robots, before Bay jumps ahead to the 21st century when mankind and the Autobots have formed an alliance. U.S. Army Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel of 'Turistas') and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson of '2 Fast 2 Furious'), command an elite squad codenamed NEST that consists of Autobots collaborating with U.S. and British soldiers to smoke out rogue Decepticons hiding anywhere in the world. The opening Shanghai sequence where NEST routs a gargantuan unicycle that wrecks more havoc than Godzilla ever visited on Tokyo gets things started off on the right track. The unicycle warns our heroes that the worst is about to befall them in the form of a monstrous entity named 'The Fallen.' The sequel focuses on a thousand year old object called 'the matrix of knowledge' that provides loads of power to whoever acquires it. The scene shifts from Shanghai to the Witwicky homestead in California where Sam (Shia LaBeouf of 'Disturbia') announces his plans to attend a prestigious Ivy League university and try to live the life of a normal twentysomething. Sam informs Bumblebee, the yellow Camaro that morphs into a monstrous robot, that he cannot accompany him. Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars on campus. Incredibly, Sam is leaving his super hottie girlfriend, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), who looks sexier than ever. After Sam's parents, Ron Witwicky (Kevin Dunn) and Judy (Julie White), get our hero situated in his dorm, they head off to Europe for a vacation. Sam and Mikaela are having their first relationship struggle. She wants him to utter the L-word 'love' but he is content only to tell her that he 'adores' her and they plan to maintain their relationship coast-to-coast via the Internet.As Sam is unpacking, a shard of the Allspark falls out of his clothing from the first movie and weird things start to happen. Remember, the AllSpark was a mystical cube that contained the key to the Transformers' existence and was thought destroyed in the original movie. Optimus Prime shows up soon afterward and explains trouble is brewing and Sam has a role to play in its resolution, but our hero refuses to participate.Of course, what Sam wants and what Sam ends up doing are two entirely different matters. In one of his classes, he scans an astronomy book from cover to cover and accuses Einstein of being wrong. Furiously, Sam starts scribbling enigmatic symbols. Later, the Decepticons return in force, steal parts of the AllSpark, excavate Megatron from the bottom of the ocean floor, sink half the U.S. Navy, and set out to destroy not only the Autobots but also the Earth. The Decepticons' primary target is Sam and they perform a full body scan to obtain vital information.'Transformers' boasts some spectacular scenes. For example, a robot versus robot mêlée around Egypt's Giza Necropolis, with the evil Devastator, a remarkably mammoth mechanoid, absorbing several construction vehicles so it can scramble atop the peak of a pyramid, is truly a sight to behold. Again, Bay and his scribes cannot inhibit their humor and they show two huge wrecking balls dangling like genitalia between its massive thighs. The scene where the Decepticons resurrect Megatron from the bottom of the ocean is exhilarating to watch. The last thing that you should be thinking about is the nincompoop who decided not to melt Megatron done into a pile of metal so nothing like this could happen. Unfortunately, had they done so it is likely that there would not have been a sequel.Mind you, 'Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen' qualifies as a big, dumb, noisy action-paced sci-fi saga that doesn't make any sense and revels in its larger-than-life idiocy. Humans take a backseat to the fracas between the mechanoids until the final moments when only Sam can save the day. Unfortunately, the humor gets entirely out of hand. Sam's college roommate follows him around the globe and spends more time screaming in terror rather than fighting. Agent Simmons (John Turturro) is back acting just as flaky as ever, too. The Ghetto twin Autobots are as obnoxious as Jar Jar Binks was in the 'Star Wars' prequel. The gags and the pranks displace the drama. The language is often rude and verges on the obscene. The surprises are few and far between. Without enumerating them, we are asked to believe that essential characters can die and never be revived. Anybody who believes for an instant that the Decepticons will vanquish the Autobots is clearly delusional, though it would have been a nice cliffhanger touch on Bay's part to stage an ending similar to 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.'",7,65,100,2 July 2009
War of the Worlds," Another Sorry Spielberg Saga
","The Steven Spielberg film adaptation of H. G. Wells' immortal 1898 novel 'War of the Worlds' would make the British author spin in his grave. Ostensibly, this predictable but gritty $135-million, special effects laden, aliens-attack-Earth epic depicts humanity run amok, casting superstar Tom Cruise as a blue-collar worker who flees urban New Jersey with his two children, a rebellious teenage son and a 'tweener daughter, after marauding extra-terrestrials launch a wholesale slaughter of humanity. The best thing about this 'War of the Worlds' is that Spielberg scraps the boomerang-shaped Martian vessels with ominous green lights from an earlier 'War of the Worlds' movie for Wells' own alien craft: lumbering, 100-foot tall aerial war machines that emit scorching heat rays and sometimes deploy three legs to tromp the planet when they aren't flying above it. Actually, the spaceships in Spielberg's movie look more like giant squid and their unearthly occupants resemble Japanese-style Kabuki-theater actors with their wedge-shaped heads. Happily, Spielberg shows these death machines early and often in an otherwise anemic 116 minute sci-fier that boasts no real hero. Cruise maims an alien at one point, but the 'Top Gun' star spends most of his time fighting his fellow man in what amounts to a 'Bore of the Worlds' rather than a 'War of the Worlds.' Nowhere near as glossy, melodramatic or just plain downright exciting as director Roland Emmerich's 'Independence Day,' 'War of the Worlds' strives lamely for realism when it should have focused on hair-raising fun. Overexposed photography designed to conceal second-rate CGI; unconvincing performances, especially by Cruise; and child actress Dakota Fanning's incessant screaming (wear ear-plugs) sabotage this saga that features few thrills and chills. Like the menacing mechanized monsters it dispatches from another world to devastate America, the film buckles under the hulk of its own ambitions and fails in its quasi-fidelity to the novel and to entertain. Despite several glaring changes to Wells' classic, such as relocating this oft-told tale to 21st century America, converting the hero into a divorced family man, and refusing to identify the aliens as Martians, Spielberg and his scenarists have retained more of the novel and its dialogue than director Bryon Haskin and scenarist Barre Lyndon did in George Pal's ground-breaking, Cold War-themed, 1953 version, a film indebted more to Orson Welles' benchmark 1938 radio version of the Wells' story. Nevertheless, people who love homages to other movies will appreciate the cameos that Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, hero and heroine in the only previous theatrical incarnation of Wells' novel, make near the end of the action.'War of the Worlds' opens with dysfunctional dock worker Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) moving semi-trailers by means of a giant crane, a task he performs with greater skill than anybody else. After he refuses to violate union rules by working overtime for his boss who desperately needs his expertise to get the job done fast, Ferrier careens home in his convertible sports car. Awaiting his late arrival from work are his pregnant ex-wife, Mary Ann (Miranda Otto of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy) and her wealthy hubby Tim (David Alan Basche of 'Full Frontal'), so Ray can take custody of his troublesome son Robbie (Justin Chatwin of 'Taking Lives') and daughter Rachel (scene-stealing Dakota Fanning of 'Hide and Seek') for the weekend while Mary Ann and Tim visit her parents in Boston. No sooner have Mary Ann and Time left than strange things happen. Fiery lightning bolts strike the city and short-circuit all electrical appliances and motor vehicles just as a nuclear denotation would damage all electronic systems. Initially, Ray thinks that it is just a storm, until he joins a crowd on the street. In shocked disbelief, Ray and countless others watch as an asphalt intersection cracks up and a canopied metallic giant bursts from the ground. These intimidating Goliath-like machines emit murderous rays that turn humans into dust and send their apparel swirling in the breeze. Thinking quickly, Ray collects Robbie and Rachel, steals a repaired station-wagon from his friend's garage, and hits the road. Meanwhile, the highways stand cluttered with broken-down cars and trucks, and Ray refuses to stop for anybody. Robbie hates Ray for tucking his tail between his legs and running. Robbie wants a piece of the action and vows to join the fight against the extra-terrestrials. Eventually, a chaotic crowd halts Ray and family and an armed bystander hijacks Ray's mini-van. During their journey to Boston, Ray and company encounter a lunatic survivalist Harlan Ogilvy (Oscar-winner Tim Robbins of 'Mystic River') who wants to dig a vast network of tunnels to surprise and defeat the aliens.Spielberg and company have done such an extensive job of updating the Wells' book, you'd think that he would add some explanation about the villainous aliens, but these predators remain mysterious. The staple of movies like 'War of the Worlds' is the scientist-as-protagonist who tries to explain the phenomenon that humanity and he are up against. No such scientist figures exist to describe, explain, or clarify the monsters, so the surprise ending seems like more than a cop-out than a revelation, even though Spielberg took it from the text. Woe unto those who plan to see 'War of the Worlds,' because it feels like a half-baked fire-drill rather than a full-blown alien invasion.",5,2,5,20 June 2007
All Quiet on the Western Front," Milestone's First and Best Anti-War Epic
","Louis Milestone's 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is a testament not only to the resilience of author Erich Maria Remarque, who was wounded five times, but also to the determination by Universal Pictures producer Carl Laemmle, Jr., son of Universal Studios founder Carl Laemmle, to produce prestige films. If any movie demonstrated the absurdity of war, this movie does with images and scenes that are unforgettable. Told from the perspective of the Kaiser's army, we follow a school boy and his pals from the class room to the trenches. Initially, an elderly, spectacled, school teacher raves about how they must defend the pride of the fatherland as soldiers can be seen marching outside past the school. 'Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do. Strike with all our power. Give every ounce of strength to win victory before the end of the year. It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again. You are the life of the fatherland, you boys. You are the iron men of Germany. You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy when you are called upon to do so. It is not for me to suggest that any of you should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads. I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom and enlisted in a mass. But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.' Paul (Lew Ayers) and then his pals encounter the true horrors of war. These horrors include not only the actual battlefield but the devastating horrors on their own side of the battlefield. Later, we watch as our protagonists struggle to make sense out of war and how it started. The most captivating character of the film is Kat (Louis Wolheim) who steals the film. Compared with contemporary films, 'All Quiet on the Western Front' lacks the brutality of war, aside from one shot of two severed hands clinging to a barbed wire fence. Like most memorable war pictures, the action is confined to the trenches with no scenes played out in map rooms as general pontificate about strategy. Milestone would later helm more war movies, including 'The Purple Heart' (1944), 'A Walk in the Sun' (1945), 'Halls of Montezuma' (1950) and 'Pork Chop Hill' (1959).",10,3,3,11 March 2015
12 Years a Slave," A Powerful and Evocative Epic About Slavery in the Old South
","A searing indictment of chattel slavery in the antebellum South, '12 Years a Slave' depicts the tragic odyssey of a free-born African-American violinist shanghaied and sold into slavery by unscrupulous white chiselers. Solomon Northup's literary chronicle implicates himself as much for his own naivety as the avarice of the assailants who hoodwinked him for monetary gain. Two smooth-talking con artists in top-hats persuade our hero to leave the safety of New York so he can play his fiddle at a concert in Washington, D.C. They assure Northup that they will pay him handsomely for his services and reimburse him for any expenses incurred during the trip to and from the capitol. The surprises and shocks that ensue as a consequence of their mendacity turn Northup's life upside-down. British-born, black director Steve McQueen and 'Red Tails' screenwriter John Ridley pull few punches in their largely realistic portrayal of Northup's exploits. They adapted Northup's eloquent autobiographical account of his captivity between 1841 and 1853. Of course, nobody should be flabbergasted that Northup's memoirs contain a far greater wealth of information than the film. Naturally, McQueen and Ridley had to eliminate some Northup's various adventures to make a movie under two-and-a-half-hours in length. Northup's hanging provides one clear example. Three bitter whites resolve to string up Northup until an overseer intervenes. In Northup's memoir, he was never actually hanged. In McQueen's film, Northup is hanged, but he manages to balance himself on the tip-toes until somebody cuts down. ' Mind you, this isn't the first time that Northup's horrific ordeal has been presented in the media. 'Shaft' director Gordon Parks produced 'Solomon Northup's Odyssey' back in 1984 for PBS's 'American Playhouse' anthology television series. After its original telecast, the Parks' teleplay came out on home video as 'Half Slave, Half Free.' Inexplicably, McQueen had never heard about Solomon Northup and his plight when he was searching for a story to shoot about slavery. Unlike Parks and his 'American Playhouse' production, Mc Queen and Ridley were not restrained by the straitlaced standards of television censorship. As much as '12 Years a Slave' is a yarn about courage in the face of wholly insurmountable odds, this Fox Searchlight release qualifies as a horror movie that provides little relief from our protagonist's travails until the end credits roll. Happily, McQueen doesn't paint all whites as unrepentant dastards. Indeed, our hero survives this adversity because compassionate whites stand up to unsavory whites. Nonetheless, for all but a quarter-hour of its running time, '12 Years a Slave' makes you abhor the individuals who abuse Solomon. The worst plantation owner of the bunch rapes his most productive black female slave repeatedly on a regular basis while his jealous wife dreams up schemes to drive the object of her husband's lust from their property.Movies about Southern slavery, sometimes referred to as the 'peculiar institution,' usually focus on slaves born into bondage. McQueen sought to make a film that would appeal to broader audience. Ridley and he found in Northup's memoir the perfect vehicle for this perspective. Since Northup had been born free, we can identify with him more than we might a poor soul who never possessed his freedom. Similarly, the same is true of those 18th century British sea-faring tales about helpless lads kidnapped by press gangs and forced into service by His Majesty's Government because they happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. In '12 Years a Slave,' two grifters posing as traveling entertainers appealed to Solomon's vanity as a musician to earn some quick, easy cash. When things seem too good to be true is when you should flee temptation. Solomon trusts these gentlemen implicitly, and they escort him to the nation's capitol. Once they arrive, they wine and dine him at an elegant restaurant and then slip him a Mickey Finn, the equivalent of the date rape drug Rohypnol, in his libation. When he entered Washington, Solomon was dressed as splendidly as any Caucasian gentleman. When he awakens the following morning on the outskirts of the capitol, Solomon finds himself attired in a night gown with a web of chains on both his wrists and ankles. When he protests his status as a free-born black, the slave traders whip him into submission with a wooden paddle. At this point, our hero winds up far from home in Louisiana where he must pick cotton, cut sugar cane, and grovel before his bull-whip wielding masters.'12 Years a Slave' lives up to its R-rating. The film contains considerable violence and cruelty, with extreme profanity as well as some nudity and brief sexuality. Various characters utter the politically incorrect N-word as many as 60 times in the company of other derogatory adjectives. The violence is far more disturbing than the sexuality. Nude scenes occur when the slaves must bathe before an auction. Similarly, when buyers inspect the slaves, they force them to strip naked. According to Northup's memoirs, slaves whose bodies bore the mark of the lash were not as easy to sell as slaves with unblemished bodies. A slave with too many scars was regarded as rebellious and considered poor prospect for sale. 12 Years a Slave' makes the Hollywood classic 'Gone with the Wind' look like a fairy tale. Although nobody suffers the loss of body parts as in the television mini-series 'Roots,' the torture scenes where a female slave is lashed so badly that her back resembles a chopping board and male slaves are hoisted atop tree branches to hang until dead equal any of the ghastly horrors in Steven Spielberg 1993 Holocaust epic 'Schindler's List.' English actor Chiwetel Ejiofor of 'American Gangster' gives an unforgettable performance as Solomon Northup who suffered untold terror at the hands of his sadistic captors. Naturally, as formidable as McQueen's film is, Solomon Northup's memoir is ten times more fascinating.",9,4,8,17 November 2013
30 Days of Night," Different Kind of Vampires
","The novelty of director David Slade's vampire movie '30 Days of Night' is its unique Alaskan setting. The opening titles reveal that Barrow is the northernmost town in the United States, with some 80 miles of road less wilderness separating it from its nearest neighbors. Moreover, once a month every year during the winter, the sun doesn't shine on Barrow. Anybody that knows anything about vampires knows that they only come out at night to prey. Cleverly, '30 Days of Night' exploits this bit of vampire lore for maximum impact, and the clueless citizens of Barrow line up like a buffet for these atheist bloodsuckers. Scenarists Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie, and Brian Nelson drew their blood-curdling screenplay for this ghoulish, often gruesome, exercise in nihilism from the 2004 graphic IDW novel series by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. Moviegoers who love their horror chillers basted in blood and gore will relish this taut tale of terror. Although the basic plot doesn't depart drastically from the standard vampire movie formula, the '30 Days' vampires differ from the Bela Lugosi/Christopher Lee variety. The '30 Days' vampires don't shape-shift into either wolves or bats. They dress in conventional clothes, bare jagged shark-like teeth rather than the dual canine fangs, and they feed on their victims like sharks rending flesh in a frenzy. Further, they defy gravity and bounce around like circus acrobats, and two of them boast enough strength to flip an SUV. They deploy their razor-sharp, talon-like fingernails to slash open gullets before they feast on the wounded. Finally, only the leader of these vampires can speak, and his accent is so thick and guttural that subtitles are necessary to translate his words.As the last day of sunlight fades over Barrow, Alaska, North Slope Borough Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett of 'Sin City') encounters 'strange' things. First, Eben and his deputy discover a pit of melted down cell phones. Second, they learn that vandals have destroyed a helicopter for no apparent reason. Third, a knife-wielding maniac has savagely slaughtered an entire kennel of sled-dogs. No, the dogs die off-screen, only the human die on screen. Meanwhile, Eben's estranged wife Stella (Melissa George of 'Turistas') is scrambling to get out of Barrow before the airport shuts down. She works for the state fire marshal, and she's finishing up her inspection of the Barrow facility. While she is driving through the snow-swept landscape to the airport, a man steering a snow-plow collides with her when his brakes lock up. You'll chuckle at the folks who jump in their seats at this scene. Unhappily, Stella finds herself stranded in Barrow for 30 days with a man that she doesn't want to see.Eben arrests an unkempt ruffian at the local diner, the Stranger (Ben Foster of '3:10 to Yuma'), for threatening the cashier. Suddenly, the lights go dark, the phones go dead, and the Internet goes down. The creepy Stranger warns Eben that bad things are in store for Barrow. Everywhere, blurry figures erupt from the shadows. They pounce without warning on the unsuspecting. They haul their victims out of sight in seconds as if sharks had seized them and dragged them underwater. Eben and Stella gather a small group of people, and they hideAnne Frank stylein the attic of a boarded-up house while the vampires storm Barrow. Eventually, Eben learns the hard way about thetwo ways to slay these bloodsuckers. You can either lop their heads off with an axe or obliterate their noggins with a shotgun. Again, these vampires aren't the traditional variety. Similarly, '30 Days' doesn't qualify as a run-of-the-mill vampire movie.Aside from one reference to Bela Lugosi, the '30 Days' characters know nothing about vampires. They never discuss the merits of wooden stakes over crosses or vials of holy water versus the use of garlic. Mirrors never play a part in any conversation. These animalistic vampires enter wherever they please without awaiting an invitation like the Bela Lugosi/Christopher Lee variety. These seemingly invincible fangsters follow their leader Marlow (Danny Huston of 'The Kingdom') without question. The high point of '30 Days'--or low point depending on your opinion--occurs when our heroes scavenge for food and medical supplies in a supermarket. A little girl (newcomer Abbey-May Wakefield) with a five o'clock shadow of dried blood on her jowls and a devilish glint in her black eyes lurks on the premises. She spots the small band of survivors. Like a suicidal, banzai-screaming Japanese soldier, she attacks them with her shark teeth bared, screaming for their blood.'Hard Candy' helmer David Slade takes his sinister subject matter pretty seriously. The R-rated violence is appropriately grim, sometimes even horrendous, with no shortage of blood spilled. The squeamish should avoid '30 Days.' The performances are low-key, with Josh Harnett looking believably resilient for a change. Melissa George plays Stella with convincing grit. Slade shuns the use of comic relief to lighten things up when events turn truly nasty as the number of good guys dwindles during the 30 days of darkness. In many ways, Slade's horror opus resembles a B-western. The terrain is stark, rugged and inhospitable. The enigmatic night creatures invade Barrow, ostensibly from a ship anchored in the Arctic ice, and they behave like sadistic Apaches who want to annihilate everybody and destroy everything. In other words, they amount to memorable, menacing malefactors. The hero's strategy to defeat the fangsters is the last thing that you'd expect, but the showdown between Marlow and Eben looks straight out of a western. Although the story takes place in an Alaskan pipeline community, the filmmakers staged the mayhem on location in New Zealand. '30 Days of Night' ranks as an above-average, white-knuckled, full-fanged vampire epic that goes for the jugular.",8,2,6,1 November 2007
Sausage Party," The Secret Life of Groceries
","If you enjoy comedies loaded with rude, crude, and often lewd humor, the adult-oriented, computer-generated, supermarket saga 'Sausage Party' qualifies as a delicious treat you may want to savor more than once. Seth Rogen heads a top-notch cast of voice performers, including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Harlan Williams, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, who incarnate grocery store items spouting obscenities about the validity of life after purchase. This imaginative but disconcerting Sony/Columbia Pictures' release lives up to its R-rating with more vulgar relish than most live-action movies dare. The last time I saw a movie as potentially offensive as 'Sausage Party' was 'South Park' creator Trey Parker's sarcastic 'Team America: World Police' (2004) where puppets performed degrading acts of all kinds on themselves. Initially, 'Sausage Party' reminded me of those popular Pixar kid comedies about cars and dolls that have acquired the power of reason and behave as if they were human. Mind you, parents should NOT take their children to see 'Sausage Party' unless they want to contend with questions about theology, aberrant sexuality, and the abuse of bath salts as a recreational drug alternative. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg said that they sought to make the equivalent of a Pixar blockbuster but with a scatological spin. Actually, the whole thing looks like an extended California Raisins cartoon, right down to the white gloves that many characters wear. Clocking in at a lean 83-minutes, 'Sausage Party' amounts to a clever Pixar parody from fade-in to fadeout unless its fundamentally blasphemous agenda alienates you. Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and the late Christopher Hitchens would likely applaud it for its atheism. Not since Woody Allen has anybody tried to ponder issues about life and death and the whole damn thing as much as co-directors Greg Tiernan of the 'Thomas & Friends' series and Conrad Vernon of 'Shrek 2,' along with scenarists Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg. While the animated supermarket products yearn to be purchased and redeemed by the gods before their shelf life expiration date, 'Sausage Party' also contains a conventional heroes versus villains narrative. Ultimately, humor and good taste unravel toward the end when the filmmakers go overboard with an orgy to end all orgies. How 'Sausage Party' avoided an NC-17 rating is a mystery.Set during the Fourth of July holiday, 'Sausage Party' unfolds inside a sprawling Shopwell's supermarket, but additional scenes occur in the suburbs, too. Everything is told from the perspective of supermarket items whether they be fruits, meats, vegetables, liquids, cookies, candies, and/or cleaning products. A hotdog named Frank (Seth Rogen of 'Knocked Up'), cannot wait to snuggle up with the dame of his dreams, Brenda (Kristen Wiig of 'Ghostbusters'), a voluptuous Betty Boop-type bun with lipstick and eyelashes. Frank is stuck in a Fancy Dogs' package of frankfurters near Brenda's package of Glamorous Buns, and these two ogle each other like hormone-addled teenagers. Indeed, 'Sausage Party' is an anthropomorphic allegory where frankfurters, buns, bagels, jars of honey mustard, cookies, cleaning products, and imperishables discuss their fate as if they were human. At the same time, humans dominate this skewered universe. However, the supermarket items and the humans cannot communicate with each other, unless the humans inject themselves with bath salts. At this point, things get hopelessly absurd. Of course, nothing about abusing bath salts is remotely facetious, but 'Sausage Party' uses bath salts as a gag. Predictably, actor James Franco voices the anonymous individual named Druggie who discovers to his horror that he can converse with a hotdog after he shoots up with bath salts. Meantime, what is genuinely hilarious is watching various goofy food items nestled around a campfire smoking marijuana. When was the last time that you saw a frankfurter getting stoned in a movie? Anyway, our hero and heroine live in a warped world where they believe that the humans who shop for them are actually gods. Furthermore, our hero and heroine believe that if they are ripe enough and fresh enough these hallowed gods will choose them and literally take them to 'The Great Beyond' where they will attain celestial fulfillment. Everything comes crashing down when a human accidentally buys the wrong kind of mustard and brings his jar of honey mustard back to exchange it for regular mustard. The jar of honey mustard surprises everybody with his shocking revelations about what really occurs after purchase. Later, we are shown what happens after these happy items arrive at homemaker's kitchen. At this point, 'Sausage Party' turns into an amusing but eerie parody of a torture-porn horror epic. Miraculously, one hotdog manages to escape this slaughter-house scene whereupon he encounters Druggie.Unmistakably, 'Sausage Party' isn't geared for everybody. Some scenes are so outlandish that you cannot help but laugh. At the same time, you find yourself chuckling perhaps at stuff you wouldn't ordinarily treat with such levity. The melodrama in 'Sausage Party' concerns a Douche, female hygiene bottle, who dreams lustily about the woman who added him to her shopping cart. She has also chosen the demoralized jar of honey mustard, and it decides to commit suicide by jumping out of her shopping cart. Frank and Brenda struggle to save him, but fail when another shopping cart collides with them. Everything turns upside down. Frank and Brenda topple from the cart along with other food items. The scene is reminiscent of 'Saving Private Ryan' with a can of noodles scraping his noodles together and tucking them back inside his ruptured canister. Before it is all over with, Frank and Brenda lead a revolt against mankind while a pink, paraplegic blob of gum imitating Stephen Hawking engineers a 'Stargate' escape archway out of a toilet rim trimmed with Christmas lights to transport them to friendlier universe. As sacrilegious as it is sidesplitting, 'Sausage Party' provides summer moviegoers with a drastic change of pace from the habitual Hollywood hokum.",9,22,47,13 August 2016
Ice Age," Far-Fetched But Funny Animal Yarn
","The computer-animated epic 'Ice Age' musters cross-generational appeal--adolescents as well as adults--with its 'Looney Tunes' like tale about a woolly mammoth, Manfred (Ray Romano), a dim-witted sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo of 'The Pest'), and a sagacious saber-toothed tiger, Diego (Denis Leary of 'The Amazing Spiderman') and their exploits 20,000 years ago when glaciers moved and wildlife migrated. Director Chris Wedge and co-director Carlos Saldanha get things off to a hilarious start with a woebegone little character named 'Scrat' as it chases an acorn without being crushed by a glacier. The desperate efforts by the varmint to save the acorn while not being killed by the ice makes this opening gambit wonderfully funny. Basically, this is a road trip comedy with an odd couple. The story unfolds rather dramatically with a pack of saber-tooth tigers plotting to wipe out a village of prehistoric humans so that they can get the morsel of a baby. Later, the helpless Sid has to elude a couple of pugnacious rhinos and Manfred intervenes to save his life from the rhinos. The saber-tooth tigers attack the village. During the battle, the mother seizes her baby and flees. Diego corners her on a high rock above a water fall and she plunges into the rapidly flowing water to save her child. Downriver she manages to get the baby safely put on land while Manfred and Sid watch. The next time that we see them, Sid observes that the mother is 'gone.' 'Ice Age' turns into three critters and a baby. The baby grows up enough to learn how to watch. Other amusing gags include our heroes stumbling upon a tribe of dodo birds that contribute more to their own extinction by stupidity than the dangers that they face. Diego joins up with Manfred and Sid but he does so because the saber-tooth tiger leader wants him to deliver the baby alive or suffer dire consequences. We learn later on from a cave painting what may have happened to Manfred's family. 'Ice Age' packs several surprises, and sensitive adults will shed tears at Diego's untimely demise. Sid and the acorn-chasing Scrat steal the show. The animation is particularly good, too. The end gambit with a frozen Scrat washing ashore on an island is a rib-tickling hoot.",8,0,0,2 April 2011
Joker," Sympathy for the Devil
","Joaquin Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance as the most popular of Batman's adversaries in 'Hangover' writer & director Todd Phillips' 'The Joker,' but this dreary, cruel DC Super Villain standalone saga qualifies as routine and forgettable. Indeed, this 'origins' film shares more in common with the television 'origins' series 'Gotham' (2014-2019) where the heroes and villains who would later either align themselves with or against the Caped Crusader were depicted in their own embryonic stages of growth. Accordingly, in 'The Joker,' the villainous maniac appears briefly in a scene with young master Bruce Wayne at stately Wayne Manor. Phillips treats the Joker as a victim skewered both by fate and society. Shaped in the callous crucible of a decadent society where only the strong survive-yes, a Darwinist society, we watch as Arthur Fleck, a lowly rent-a-clown, metamorphosizes from a friendly but forlorn fool into a full-blown psychotic fanatic. Phillips' sympathy for the Devil interpretation of the Joker represents yet another step in the never-ending evolution of the characters in the DC Universe.
If you're looking for a traditional clash of wits during the Joker's emergence as evil incarnate, you may be disappointed. Batman doesn't participate in his rudimentary antics because he hasn't grown up. This sociological storyline charts Arthur Fleck's rise from rotten soil, but there is little to admire apart from Phoenix's dynamic performance. Phillips' 'The Joker' exemplifies what happens when an individual is treated as a victim of society rather than an architect of its terrors. Phoenix's Joker is neither as flamboyant as Jack Nicholson's sarcastic prankster in Tim Burton's 'Batman' (1988) nor as fiendish as Heath Ledger's the demented but cerebral nemesis in Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' (2008). We must not overlook Jared Leto's inspired Joker in David Ayer's spin-off 'Suicide Squad' (2016), but who explored the Gotham villain in traditional terms like his predecessors. Meanwhile, despite its sketchy plot and ponderous tw0-hour length running time, Phillips desires praise for his imaginative evocation of everything 1970s when New York City loomed as a sleazy, dark, dangerous setting that spawned the pugnacious 'Death Wish' movies as well as violent stalker movie 'Taxi Driver.'You may either know or have known somebody like Arthur Fleck. A wholly pathetic but blissfully ignorant fellow, Arthur means well, but he winds up as his own worst enemy. At one point, he proclaims his mission in life is to make people smile. Fleck shares this laudable goal about himself when he finds himself transfixed in the spotlight of a local Big Apple television talk show, hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro of 'Taxi Driver') who amuses himself by ridiculing our protagonist. Star-struck by Murray and his moment in the lime light, Arthur aspires to be a stand-up comic. Sadly, he is far too perplexed by the puzzle of his warped psyche to succeed as a gifted comic. He spends more time crying than jesting when he appears in front of an audience at a nightclub. Earlier, Arthur revealed he resides with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy of 'Catwoman'), in a huge, anonymous apartment building where the residents are packed in tighter than sardines. Penny spins different versions of her own misguided life. A former employee of Thomas Wayne, Penny assures Arthur she toiled faithfully for the elder Wayne until she had to sign certain hush agreements before she landed in Arkham Asylum. Penny deludes poor Arthur into believing he is the offspring of a broken office romance with the titan of finance. 'The Joker' treats Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen of 'The Dark Knight Rises') as an ill-mannered, snobbish, billionaire who lacks his son's sympathy for the plight of others. Indeed, 'The Joker' separates everybody in its universe into the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.' Eventually, this disparity between the impoverished lower classes and the affluent upper classes eventually erupts into a class war. Although he doesn't realize it, the Joker finds himself the messiah of the 'have-nots.' By this time, clown mania has swept New York, and denizens in white-face spark terror as they plunge into a rampage against law and order. This hysteria climaxes when a man in a clown mask-not Arthur Fleck's Joker-murders a well-dressed couple in a Gotham back alley but leaves their adolescent son unscathed with their blood spatter on his face!Joaquin Phoenix has a field day as Arthur Fleck as well as the Joker. The devastating transformation during this two-hour opus is truly memorable. He gives the performance of a lifetime, and you cannot help but admire everything that Phillips and he do in his revisionist stab at the Joker. Not only does Phoenix make absurd faces, but he relies on genuinely bizarre body language to accentuate his inner wickedness. At times, he strikes postures that resemble a spider in its death throes. During a scene on a bus, Arthur amuses an African American lad with his facial frolics, but the child's mother is not amused. She reprimands Arthur, and he bursts into gales of hysterical laughter that mimic the Wicked Witch of the West from 'The Wizard of Oz.' This laughter alarms everybody on the bus, but it is creates the kind of atmosphere where you're tempted to join in with it. Earlier, when Arthur was doing a street gig outside a store that was going out of business, he is assailed by juvenile delinquents who steal his signboard, lead him on a merry chase, and then beat him black and blue in an alley. The best scene in 'Joker' occurs during a subway encounter with three drunken businessmen. Arthur triumphs over evil, but he goes beyond the pale in an incident comparable to the Bernhard Goetz subway shooting in Manhattan in 1984. Instead of shooting African Americans, Arthur guns down three white guys with gusto. This launches him on his career of crime.Ultimately, 'The Joker' amounts to the kind of mental health movie you need watch only once to get its deadly point.",5,11,42,13 October 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," My All-Time Favorite War Movie!!!
","'Great Expectations' director David Lean made what qualifies as the greatest World War II movie of all-time. I saw this fantastic film when Columbia Pictures released it, and the spectacle of an actual bridge being blown to smithereens with a real locomotive and freight cars on it captivated me at the tender age of four, and I have never forgotten it. I've seen it more times than I can remember, and this movie has never lost its allure for me. This stirring epic is based on Pierre Boulle's award-winning 1952 novel, but director David Lean and scenarists Michael Wilson of 'A Place in the Sun' and Carl Foreman of 'High Noon' took several liberties with the storyline. First, Boulle didn't obliterate the bridge. The British commandos were able to derail the train, but the bridge remained intact. Second, Colonel Nicholson discovered the sabotage, but he didn't collapse on the plunger and blow-up the bridge. Third, no Americans, specifically the character of Shears, appeared in the novel. Fourth, although there was a Shears, he was a British commando, but he tried to cross the river during the finale to kill Nicholson. Fifth, the British said that they had to send in commandos because the RAF couldn't fly the distance to bomb the bridge. In Boulle's novel, the British don't send in bombers because they felt the Japanese could repair any damage from bombing raids and have the bridge back in action. Nevertheless, this memorable film brims with irony and answers all the questions about life. This movie also immortalized the whistling march theme 'Colonel Bogey March.' Interestingly, former British POWs hated the movie and wanted to lambaste it, but they kept their silence for fear that their protests would provide more publicity for a movie that they felt deserved nothing in the way of publicity.Nevertheless, 'Bridge on the River Kwai' won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Photography, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Music, and Best Editing. This is a beautiful movie and the cast is stupendous. Although Alec Guinness won the Oscar for Best Actor, I believe that the incomparable William Holden as the only American prisoner of war steals the movie hands down. Holden made a specialty of playing anti-heroic roles. As Shears, he is at his anti-heroic best. Sadly, Sessue Hayakawa did not win for Best Supporting Actor, but he makes a terrific adversary.Essentially, David Lean's masterpiece is a drama about a clash of wills in the middle of the jungle during World War II. Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness of 'Star Wars') and his British officers and enlisted men survive a grueling march through the jungle to a Japanese labor camp where camp commandant Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa)orders them to erect a bridge across the River Kwai. Saito stipulates in no uncertain terms that British officers will work alongside their men, but Colonel Nicholson refuses to abide by these terms. He cites the rules of the Geneva Convention. Saito's reaction is incredulity, 'Do not speak to me of rules. This is war! This is not a game of 'cricket!' Saito puts him in a sweat box and the intense heat very nearly kills Nicholson. Nonetheless, Nicholson refuses to give in to Saito's demands. Meanwhile, construction work on the bridge commences, but the Japanese make virtually no headway. At the same time, Shears engineers an escape from the camp and nearly dies in the process. The two British soldiers that accompany him die in the attempt. Natives find the destitute Shears washed up on the shores of their villages. They nurse Shears back to life, furnish him with supplies, and send him on his way. Eventually, he reaches British lines. Back at the Kwai camp, Saito loses the battle of wills and releases Nicholson and agrees that the British officers do not have to work Ironically, Nicholson decides to embrace the bridge construction so as to occupy his men and prove to the Japanese that the British soldier is the best soldier in the world. When Nicholson's chief medical officer, Major Clipton (James Donald of 'The Great Escape') suggests that helping the Japanese erect a bridge could qualify as treason, Nicholson reminds him that they were ordered to surrender to the enemy. Nicholson goes on to say, 'If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your job or would you let him die?Would you have it be said that our chaps can't do a better job? You're a fine doctor, Clipton, but you've a lot to learn about the army.' Nicholson and his officers devise a way of building a suitable bridge and one of Nicholson's engineers tells him that a similar bridge built of wood survived 300 years. Nicholson becomes so obsessed with the project that he eventually has his own officers pitch in and finish it.The British decide to dispatch a team of commandos led by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins of 'Shalako') to destroy the bridge. Warden convinces a reluctant Shears to lead them to it since he knows the way. Shears explains that he cannot because he isn't really an officer. It seems that when his ship sank, he swam ashore, appropriated an officer's insignia and impersonated an officer, erroneously believing he would receive better treatment than an enlisted man. Such was not the case. Warden informs him that they knew about his masquerade. He also gives Shears the simulated rank of major for the mission. Reluctantly, Shears agrees to lead Force 316 through the jungle to the bridge. They bail out over enemy territory and then they have to take an entirely different route because the route that Shears took is swarming now with Japanese. Our heroes have to make a forced march through swamps with leeches, across mountains, and eventually they reach the bridge.This movie ranks as the greatest war movie ever made.",10,1,5,8 November 2009
Man on Fire," 'Man On Fire' simmers but rarely blazes . . .
","The Denzel Washington movie 'Man On Fire' (**1/2 out of ****) suffers from poor plotting and a bad ending. Hopelessly downbeat and riddled with clichés galore, this predictable but atmospheric abduction mystery thriller focuses largely on its charismatic star. However, alcoholic bodyguard John Creasy generates little of the charisma that most Denzel Washington heroes beam with blinding wattage. British director Tony Scott has cast his winsome Oscar-winning star against type as a depressed, low-key, guilt-stricken individual with few reasons to live. Although this self-pitying protagonist serves to stretch Denzel's acting range, very little about John Creasy as a character appears remotely appealing. By the way, a bodyguard who shuns body armor is asking a little too much in a shoot'em up saga. Bulletproof vests make or break this kind of crime genre picture. Furthermore, Scott and scenarist Brian Helgeland keep us at arm's length from Denzel's unglamorous character to make him look more credible. Incredibly, for a brooding, action-oriented suspenser with an antsy documentary flavor, the best scenes in 'Man On Fire' occur when Denzel's washed-up ex-soldier Creasy carries on conversations with a delightful Dakota Fanning as the inquisitive child he shields from the evil kidnappers in crime-ridden, corrupt Mexico City. Mind you, the shoot-outs look great, and the middle part of 'Man On Fire' resembles vintage 1970's Charles Bronson vigilantism with its cynical disregard for life, but the movie only comes alive when Denzel and Dakota are together on screen.As John Creasy, Denzel delivers a thoroughly convincing performance as a former U.S. Special Forces anti-terrorist expert who has hit rock bottom and desperately needs a job. Creasy looks up an old buddy, Rayburn (Christopher Walken of 'The King of New York'), in Mexico, and Rayburn lands him a job as a bodyguard for a wealthy Mexico City businessman whose young daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning of 'The Cat In The Hat'), makes a prime target for kidnappers. Early on, we're told kidnapping is rampant in Mexico City, and Samuel (Marc Anthony of 'Hackers') hires Creasy, even though he knows Creasy drinks. Predictably, during the first half of 'Man On Fire,' Pita draws Creasy out of his self-destructive shell. She even names her pet bear after him. Before long Creasy gives up trying not to be Pita's friend and becomes her surrogate father. The scenes where Creasy trains Pita for a swimming match represent the high point of this uneven but entertaining opus. Predictably, kidnappers grab Pita and blow Creasy full of holes, not enough to kill him, but enough to slow down the movie. Again, where is the ubiquitous bulletproof vest? Half the action epics made these days stage the dramatic near-death scene where the resilient hero takes ten shots in the chest then sheds his shirt to reveal his slug encrusted body armor. Not Creasy. He doesn't wear armor, so we have to wait for him to recover from his wounds.About two-and-a-half hours in length, 'Man On Fire' lurches along under Tony Scott's self-consciously artsy, pseudo documentary style. After a while, the jiggling camera technique that gives the film its newsreel quality will get on your nerves. When the kidnappers are gunned down trying to retrieve the ransom, everything goes haywire. Not surprisingly, the thugs holding Pita say they have killed her. The rest of the movie follows Creasy as he hunts down anybody who had anything to do with the abduction. 'Man On Fire' ranks Denzel's most savage film. In some ways, it resembles the Luc Besson man/girl thriller 'The Professional' where a pre-teenage girl taught an adult male how to appreciate life. Refreshingly, neither Scott nor scenarist Brian Helgeland of 'Payback' fame make up any excuses for their hero's murderous rampage. Creasy kills each of the kidnappers without remorse. Along the way, Creasy uncovers a ring of corruption in the Mexico City police that defies imagination. Nearly every cop is on the take and they live in terror of assassination.When Tony Scott makes good movies, he helms memorable classics like 'Top Gun,' 'Beverly Hills Cop 2,' 'The Last Boy Scout, ''True Romance,' and 'Spy Games.' When he makes bad movies, he cranks out crap like 'The Fan,' 'Revenge,' 'Days of Thunder,' and 'Crimson Tide.' Sadly, 'Man On Fire' belongs to the latter category. If 'Man On Fire' weren't bad enough for Helgeland's half-baked script, it turns out this movie is a remake of an abysmal Scott Glenn movie from 1987 called 'Man On Fire!' Aside from Denzel's superb performance, 'Man On Fire' simmers but rarely blazes.",7,1,3,22 June 2007
Edge of Tomorrow," Cruise Still Has An Edge!!!
","The soldier that Tom Cruise plays in 'Edge of Tomorrow' gets his butt kicked all over creation. 'Bourne Identity' director Doug Limon's supercharged, imaginative, science fiction time-loop thriller synthesizes elements of 'Starship Troopers' and 'Source Code.' Surpassing Cruise's earlier desolation Earth outing 'Oblivion,' 'Edge of Tomorrow' differs chiefly in terms of story and setting. Although 'Oblivion' occurred on post-apocalyptic planet Earth, 'Edge of Tomorrow' takes place before the apocalypse, with mankind desperately pitted against aggressive extraterrestrials with no compassion. Lightning-fast, squid-like creatures called 'Mimics' have invaded Earth. These invincible whirling dervishes with tentacles have been on the warpath now for the last five years, blitzing their way across the European continent, and advancing toward England without any sign of slowing down. Predictably, Cruise lands on his feet in the middle of this catastrophic, life and death mayhem. He doesn't play the usual heroic character that he played in 'Top Gun.' This represents the first time Cruise has portrayed a yellow-livered skunk. He goes from being a coward to a hero in an arc that is as entertaining as the film is exciting. You can differentiate Tom Cruise movies by how often he gets his butt kicked. Remember 'The Last Samurai?' Cruise had to grovel in that splendid fish-out-of-water spectacle set in Japan. Usually Cruise doesn't grovel. His groveling, however, makes his subsequent acts of heroism all the more convincing. Mind you, 'Edge of Tomorrow' would still qualify as a good, solid movie even if Cruise weren't getting kicked all over creation. Mankind is poised on the brink of extinction as these insatiable aliens decimate populations. The futuristic, 80-pound, exoskeleton combat suits that the soldiers wear looks as cool as the aliens are imitating. Everything about 'Edge of Tomorrow' looks great. This isn't a shiny, chrome-plated, sci-fi epic, but a tarnished, grungy-looking one. Some of the performances stand out. As Master Sergeant Farrell, Bill Paxton steals every scene that he has with his Southern-fried drawl, while Brendan Gleeson makes a curt supreme army commander and reminded me of Norman Schwarzkopf. Last but not least, lean-muscled Emily Blunt is pretty hard-nosed and business-like as the pugnacious 'Angel of Verdun.' Alongside these fine performers, Cruise holds his own as a disgraced officer who redeems himself in the crucible of combat.Oscar winning 'Usual Suspects' scenarist Christopher McQuarrie and 'Fair Game' co-scribes Jez and John-Henry Butterworth have adapted Japanese author Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel 'All You Need is Kill,' which came out in December 2004. As a military public relations officer for the United Defense Force, Major William Cage (Tom Cruise of 'War of the Worlds') has never fired a shot in combat, but he does a commendable job as long as he is stationed far behind the lines. Imagine Cage's horror when UDF General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson of 'Braveheart') decides to embed him with ground troops as they storm the French beaches in a last ditch effort to thwart the Mimics. Cage flatly refuses Brigham's orders to follow the troops into battle. Not only does Brigham order Cage arrested and demoted to buck private, but he also assigns him to join a first wave combat unit. Although 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a sci-fi saga, the beachhead scenes where Cage and his unit are flown into action against the Mimics is reminiscent of Spielberg's classic 'Saving Private Ryan.' Like 'Starship Troopers,' the soldiers are flown into combat and dropped from helicopter-style planes. Once on the ground, the troops rely on their heavily armed battle suits to shred the Mimics with fusillades of gunfire. The Mimics are slaughtering soldiers left and right until one of them smashes headlong into Cage. Our terrified protagonist uses a mine to kill one. When Cage kills a large 'Alpha' Mimic, the slimy critter douses him with its blood. Incredibly enough, despite dying from the Mimic's blood, Cage discovers that he gets another chance to live and fight again! Essentially, like the Jake Gyllenhaal character in 'Source Code,' Cage relives the first day over and over until he encounters another soldier, Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt of 'Loopers'), who experienced the same sensation when a large 'Alpha' Mimic killed her. Before he meets Rita, Cage is killed several times in combat. Meantime, each time that he dies, Cage awakens just as suddenly to find himself back at Camp Heathrow alive and well. Director Doug Limon displays quite a bit of flair in handling the same scene over and over again. Each time that Cage reawakens from his death, he devises new ways to contend with the Mimics. Sergeant Rita explains to Cage that the same thing occurred to her at Verdun until she received a blood transfusion. Eventually, as he relives the same day over and over again ad nauseam, Cage becomes so familiar with the turbulent events of that day that he can anticipate when and where the Mimics will strike. Before long, Rita trains Cage so that they become a dynamic duo, and they discover that the Mimics have a secret that makes them invincible. When they try to convince their superiors, especially General Brigham, that they can destroy the Mimics, they are treated as deserters.Although it boasts some fascinating as well as formidable alien adversaries, 'Edge of Tomorrow' doesn't emphasize horror so much as tension and suspense. Meaning, you can watch it and not worry about leaving your lights on when you sleep for fear of nightmares. Basically, it boils down to a crackerjack mission movie with Cruise and Blunt assembling up their own crew of misfits to destroy the aliens and save the day. Director Doug Limon and his writers steer clear of romance in any way, shape, or form. The single drawback to this otherwise atmospheric, first-rate actioneer is that the filmmakers don't provide enough details about the invaders from space. Nevertheless, watching Tom Cruise get killed dozens of times until he knows what to do is as stimulating as it is amusing.",8,3,8,16 June 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Different Kind of Dracula
","Acclaimed Oscar winning film director Francis Ford Coppola sinks his cinematic fangs into the most notorious vampire in film and literature and delivers his own unique interpretation of the wicked bloodsucker with his romantic horror chiller 'Bram Stoker's Dracula.' Basically, 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' qualifies as possibly the fourth remake of Todd Browning's 'Dracula' (1931) with Bela Lugosi. Nevertheless, despite some exhibitions of fidelity to the source material, Coppola and scenarist James V. Hart set out to differentiate themselves from the previous incarnations with elements that aren't quite identical. Dracula emerges as a protagonist only vaguely related to his cinematic predecessors. Indeed, the legendary vampire appears initially as on elderly gentleman with white hair. Unlike virtually every vampire since 'Nosferatu,' Coppola's 'Dracula' can stroll the streets during the daylight hours without the sun cremating him into a pile of ashes. However, he lacks his full vampire powers. Originally, the silent film 'Nosferatu' altered the vampire's ability to thrive during the day. Mind you, in his celebrated novel, Stoker allowed his infamous bloodsucker to circulate during the daylight hours. The Dracula in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' never turns into a bat, but he does transform himself into a hideous rodent, a horny gorilla, and he has powers that go beyond his physical presence. For example, Dracula wanders around in the foreground, while in the background his shadow assumes a life of its own in contradiction to everything that his physical presence does. Although he dresses in dinner attire, this Dracula wears a number of different outfits.Interestingly, neither Coppola nor Hart seek to scare the hell out of their audience. Instead, they deliberately set out to make a romantic vampire movie filled with surprises, revelations, and a little soft-core nudity. An interesting prologue charts the history of the protagonist and how he lost his wife and then turned his back against God. The historical context that Coppola and Hart establish for their Dracula is unlike any other 'Dracula.' The performances are uniformly excellent, with Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins taking top honors. Hopkins is incredible as the vampire slayer Van Helsing and he displays a sense of humor that is refreshing. For a change, the usually stiff Keanu Reeves seems credible as a stuffy Englishman. Wynona Ryder, who brought the screenplay to Coppola after she bailed out of the director's 'Godfather 3,' is suitably cast as the beautiful object of Count Dracula's desire. As Mina, she is the reincarnation of his dead wife. You can separate the different Dracula movies by their fidelity to the source material by the use of the two characters Mina and Lucy. Some Dracula movies reverse the two, so that Mina becomes the weak girl who dies first, but Coppola and Hart stick with Stoker in this instance.The lush visual imagery is perfectly entrancing, and Coppola experiments with lots of ideas. According to the commentary track, Coppola sought to do something different from the earlier 'Dracula' movies, and he succeeds in large part with his version that makes Gary Oldman's Count Dracula look nothing like Bela Lugosi's bloodsucker or Christopher Lee's fangster. Atmospheric, intellectual, and sexually risqué, 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is a bat of a different leather.",10,0,5,2 August 2010
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Die Hard 3
","Bruce Willis reprises his role as Detective Lieutenant John McClane in director John McTiernan's crime thriller 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' with Samuel L. Jackson co-starring as a racist African-American. McClane is back with the New York Police Department, but he has been on suspension. McClane teams up with Zeus Carver to battle with a master criminal who has orchestrated the caper of a life-time. These two opposites meet in Harlem when McClane is dispatched across 110th Street and forced to wear a set of wooden sandwich boards with the N-word written on it. What we don't learn until later on is the villainous Simon Peter Gruber is related to Hans Gruber in 'Die Hard,' and he is exacting revenge while he steals the Federal Reserve Bank Depository blind. Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons of 'Damage') keeps our heroes trotting along over New York City on his random errands. Zeus finds himself stuck with McClane and Samuel L. Jackson enlivens things considerably with his hot-headed character. There are more than enough thrills to keep our attention.",9,0,0,3 March 2013
Con Air," Leave the Bunny Alone!
","Summer action movies for adult males celebrate those macho virtues that red-blooded, he-men cherish. British director Simon West's 'Con-Air' (*** out of ****), teaming Nicolas Cage with John Cusack, sizzles as a high flying take-off on all those vintage 'Airport' movies, but the passengers here are convicts who skyjack their transport for a rendezvous in the desert with Colombian drug smugglers. At the heart of this superficial but stimulating action movie lies a less than subtle Hollywood commentary on what a macho man must do to conform to society.In 'Con-Air,' Cage plays Cameron Poe, a former U.S. Army Ranger who pulls a stretch in prison for killing a knife-wielding drunkard in a brawl over his wife. Before Poe can recover, the villain's pals scoop up the knife, scram, and leave our hero to take the rap. Because Poe's Ranger training qualifies him as a lethal weapon, the court sentences him to eight years in a federal lock-up. While he is incarnated, Poe's pretty young wife Tricia (Monica Potter) has given birth to an adorable baby girl. In the second quarter-hour of 'Con-Air,' Poe and his cut little daughter exchange amusing letters. During this interval, Poe matures enough so that his exemplary behavior wins him a parole.A short plane ride is the last obstacle between Poe and his freedom. Prison officials pile him onto a cargo plane with an all-star line-up of psychopathic murderers, among them Cyrus 'the Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich of 'Dangerous Liaisons') and Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames of 'Pulp Fiction'), a vicious black militant. A clean-cut, sandal-shod U.S. Marshal named Vince Larkin (John Cusack of 'Grosse Point Blank') officiates the transfer. The plot thickens when abrasive D.E.A. agent Duncan Molloy (Colm Meaney of 'TV's 'Star Trek: The Next Generation') wins permission to smuggle a trigger-happy undercover agent on board to cajole information out of a Colombian drug lord's son. Once they're airborne, the convicts stage an ingenious jail break; ice the D.E.A. agent, and commander the plane. Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin of 'Total Recall'), then acts as an insider for Larkin. Meanwhile, Larkin clashes with Molloy who aims to avenge his dead agent by blowing the plane to smithereens! 'Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead' scenarist Scott Rosenberg has contrived this hard-fisted hokum that excites and entertains even though it is hopeless predictable from fade-in to fade-out. 'Con-Air' spends most of its two-hour running time in the air instead of behind bars. The early prison scenes establish Poe's friendship with a diabetic black prisoner named Mike Baby-O' O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson of 'Waiting to Exhale'). The filmmakers have carefully balanced good African-Americans with bad African-Americans so as to avoid charges of racism. Rosenberg has penned some catchy dialogue that serves the dual purpose of foreshadowing the action and sounding quite quotable. Nothing happens in 'Con-Air' that is not set up far in advance, so the movie never pulls any unfair tricks on its audience. Moreover, the characters spout dialogue about their predicaments that never leave any doubt for the audience about the destination of the action.Freshman director Simon West and Rosenberg endow Poe with such heroic qualities that it is difficult to believe that any court could have sent a man of his caliber up the river. After all, he is a Gulf War veteran who has just come home to his gorgeous young wife pregnant with a baby girl. Furthermore, the filmmakers hammer home Poe's Ranger's credo: no matter what the dangers, U.S. Rangers never abandon their comrades. When Poe has a chance to leave the plane, he sticks around instead to save the day. What 'Con-Air' lacks in credibility, it compensates for with its diversity of colorful characters and its pyrotechnics.Wearing scruffy shoulder length hair and flexing sculpted biceps, Nicolas Cage resembles Sylvester Stallone's 'Rambo' as he thwarts his opponents. Cage's syrupy Alabama accent gets a little thick on occasion, but he registers as a respectable enough hero. John Cusack excels in his first dramatic action role. Before 'Con-Air' crashes to a halt, Cusack's U.S. Marshal Larkin has been scorched, slugged unconscious, and nearly killed. As a sneering, egotistical D.E.A. agent, Colm Meaney is so convincing that you want to shoot him yourself.The filmmakers have assembled some really grisly looking actors as the convicts. These bad guys emerge as a truly venomous bunch that richly deserve their inevitable comeuppance. John Malkovich impersonates a character here who is just as despicable and cunning as the assassin that he played in the Clint Eastwood thriller 'In the Line of Fire.' Malkovich's predatory, bald villain boasts that he has slain more men than cancer. As his henchman, Ving Rhames is equally as nefarious. Danny Trejo of 'Desperado' fame creates a chilling portrait of lust run amok as a rapist named Johnny 23 with twenty-three hearts tattooed on his beefy forearm to represent his unfortunate rape victims.West keeps the action stirred up to such a whirlwind pace that its far-fetched elements don't detract from the excitement. 'Con-Air' is West's big-screen movie debut and he displays a lot of promise as an action director. His action scenes ripple with adrenaline, especially the plane hijacking, an ambush in a derelict airplane scrap heap, and a rousing finale in Las Vegas. The explosive music of Mark Mancina and former 'Yes' musician Trevor Rabin considerably enhances each of these slam-bang scenes. 'Yes' rock music fans will recognize those distinctive, throbbing Rabin chords that punctuate the action.Nobody should imitate 'Con-Air' or take its woefully exaggerated carnival of snap, crackle, pop violence seriously. Characters get shot, stabled, and dismembered beyond anything an ordinary individual cold take, but then this clever, slickly-packaged fantasy pokes as much fun at itself as at its audiences. One amusing scene involves the destruction of a classic sports car. Another features Cage battling with another convict because he refuses to head Poe's warning to 'leave the bunny alone.'",8,3,4,3 August 2009
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Incredibly Funny!!!
","Will Ferrell and Adam McKay of 'Saturday Night Live' recapture a bygone era of broadcast news history with their hopelessly juvenile but insanely hilarious comedy 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.' Once upon a time in television history, only men were allowed to deliver the news. Women had not yet broken the glass ceiling, and Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone creates chaos with her ambition to anchor the news desk. The action affectionately follows the shenanigans of a rating proved quartet. Ron (Will Ferrell), Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Champ (David Koechner) make up the triumphant Channel 4 News Team. Basically, this rude, crude, infantile farce draws its comic highlights primarily from Ferrell's straight-faced, over-the-top, zany performance. As the eponymous Ron Burgundy, Ferrell has a field day as a bubble-headed idiot with immaculate facial hair and a puffy coiffure. No less funny are his co-stars. Rudd and Koechner are solidly funny, but Carrell as a mentally challenged weatherman steals the show with his glassy-eyed look and demeanor. The confrontations between the Channel 4 News Teams and opposing teams from Channel 2 and Public News are funny and benefit from cameos ranging from Ben Stiller to Vince Vaughn to Tim Robbins. Other actors who contribute memorable cameos are Danny Trejo, Jack Black, and Luke Wilson. Bill Curtis adds a touch of class as the narrator. The erection is as goofy as the confrontation between Ron's dog Baxter and a bear. The belated sequel is just as funny.",10,0,1,23 December 2013
American Gangster," A Turbulent Chapter in U.S. Criminal History
","The Ridley Scott crime biography 'American Gangster' reunites Oscar winning actors Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the true-life saga of an arrogant African-American hoodlum who cornered the heroin market in the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Previously, Washington and Crowe appeared as rivals in director Brett Leonard's 1995 science fiction fantasy 'Virtuosity.' In this largely forgotten thriller, Denzel played the hero while Crowe played a villainous cyberspace serial killer that came to life. In 'American Gangster,' however, they reverse their roles with Denzel cast as the villain and Crowe as the hero. Although it far surpasses 'Virtuosity,' 'American Gangster' doesn't qualify as a classic gangster film. 'The Godfather' trilogy, both 'Scarface' flicks, 'Goodfellas,' 'Casino,' 'Once Upon a Time in America,' and 'Heat' represent the cream of crop where mobster movies are concerned. While it shares many of the same plot elements of those vintage crime movies, Scott's film is driven by its characters rather than any kind of stylist violence. 'American Gangster' contains no cleverly staged gunfights. Aside from an occasional shooting and the raid on the villain's heroin lab, Scott shuns violence and dwells for the most part on comparing and contrasting the two leads and their drastically different lifestyles. In other words, 'American Gangster' is not about a crime lord building an empire.'American Gangster' charts the rise and demise of its two chief characters. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington of 'Training Day') spent fifteen years as the driver, bodyguard, and bill collector for legendary black crime boss Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson (Clarence Williams, III of 'Reindeer Games') who ruled Harlem for four decades. After Bumpy dies from old age, Frank slips into Bumpy's shoes and takes over the heroin racket. He rings up a U.S. Army relative stationed in Bangkok, Nate (Roger Guenveur Smith of 'Final Destination'), who runs a bar for servicemen called Soul Brothers. Frank flies to Thailand. Nate and he travel upriver into the jungle to deal with a renegade Chinese General (Ric Young of 'Kiss of the Dragon') and buy $400 thousand dollars worth of uncut heroin. Frank funnels thousands of dollars through Nate to bribe U.S. Army officers, pilots, and Military Police to protect his product and fly it into America on board Uncle Sam's planes in the coffins of dead U.S. troops. Frank sells the heroin uncut at a bargain price, and the junkies come out of the woodworks. Yes, this really happened. Mafia Chieftain Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante of 'The Mambo Kings') wants some of this action and in exchange the mobster promises Frank protection from the police. Unfortunately, Frank enjoys little peace of mind, especially from corrupt New York City Police Special Investigator, Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin of 'The Goonies'), who wants his cut of Frank's million dollar profits. Nevertheless, despite the corrupt cops, Frank flourishes because the dirty cops aren't about to let anything slaughter their cash cow.Enter squeaky clean New Jersey detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe of 'Gladiator') and his not so squeaky clean partner Javier J. Rivera (John Ortiz of 'Miami Vice') who stake out a numbers runner with a million dollars in cash stashed in grocery bags in his car. When the numbers runner doesn't return for the loot, Ritchie and Javier confiscate the dough. Ritchie and Javier ponder their unique problem. If they turn a million bucks insupposedly the right thing to dothey will alienate their comrades because no cop will trust them. Javier wants to claim the cash for themselves, but Ritchie refuses. Afterward, their New Jersey comrades treat them like lepers. Since so many cops are on the take, they refuse to work with Ritchie because he isn't corrupt enough to trust. Eventually, Ritchie's boss, Lou Toback (Ted Levine of 'Silence of the Lambs'), asks him to head up a government drug task force to bust big time dealers. For a change, Ritchie's honesty provides dividends, but those dividends are not enough to preserve his marriage to wife Laura (Carla Gugino of 'The One') and they battle it out in the courts over custody of their son. Eventually, Ritchie and his hand picked crew of honest cops ferret out Frank as their chief narcotics target. Everybody else dismisses Frank as a major crime lord. The U.S. Attorney General (Roger Bart of 'Hostel, Part II') laughs at the belief that an African-American could be the mastermind behind a heroin empire.'American Gangster' rewards good and punishes evil. Unfortunately, despite its powerhouse cast, Scott's film is just good, not great. The shortage of violence that constitutes an integral feature of most gangster films is ironic when you consider that Scott helmed the incredibly bloodthirsty 'Black Hawk Down.' Instead, Scott imitates director William Friedkin's cops and drug dealers classic 'The French Connection,' that Oscar winning scenarist Steven Zallian of 'Schindler's List' makes reference to early in the story. Scott cuts back and forth between Frank and Ritchie over the course of the film's lengthy 157 minutes until they meet in the last half-hour. In the process, they omit a lot of the facts behind Frank Lucas and his million dollar heroin operation. Denzel Washington doesn't look as evil as he did in 'Training Day,' but he is brutal as Lucas. At one point, he confronts a rival gangster, puts his pistol against the guy's forehead, and warns him about forgetting to pay his tribute money. When the rival hood dares him to kill in broad daylight in front of a crowd of people, Lucas pulls the trigger without a qualm. 'American Gangster' is well worth watching for its audaciously true story set against a turbulent chapter in U.S. history.",8,0,4,14 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," A Sentimental But Witty Departure from Ferrell's Usual Farcical Films
","'Monster's Ball' director Marc Foster's 'Stranger Than Fiction' is for its star Will Ferrell what director Peter Weir's 'The Truman Show' was for its star Jim Carrey. In each film, these talented comedians play things ostensibly straight without a hint of humor. Indeed, Ferrell proves that he can hold his own without relying on wit and slapstick. Although 'Stranger Than Fiction' ends up more lightweight than 'The Truman Show,' the protagonists in both of these existential, post-modern pictures live in a world that essentially doesn't exist. On the other hand, the Ferrell flick is more dramatic, because his character is destined to die from the outset while the Carrey character in 'The Truman Show' is never in jeopardy. 'Stranger Than Fiction' qualifies as a much smaller version of Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello's classic 1925 play 'Six Characters in Search of an Author,' only freshman scenarist Zack Helm's original screenplay could be called 'one character in search of its author.' Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah, Tom Hulce, and Emma Thompson co-star with Ferrell in this imaginative fable about life, romance, responsibility, and what constitutes great art. Interestingly, at one point, Harold watches the Monty Python movie 'The Meaning of Life.'Harold Crick (Will Ferrell of 'Talladega Nights') is the epitome of the company man. As a senior IRS tax auditor in Chicago, Crick dresses impeccably, lives a model life without a mate, does everything by the book, and maintains a regimented lifestyle from which he never deviates one iota. Quite simply, he is the kind of employee that any employer would die for. He wears a special wristwatch that keeps his life on time right down to a four minute coffee break and a half-hour lunch break. He counts his steps to work and wears his tie a particular way because it shortens the length of time he needs to dress. He is the ultimate creature of habit and his life seems flawless until one day he hears somebody narrating his life and he doesn't know what to do. Naturally, nobody else hears the mellifluous British voice that utters what he does. Eventually, poor Harold learns that he is the creation of a withdrawn, neurotic, chain-smoking author, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson of 'Sense and Sensibility'), who is wrestling with a bad case of writers block. There is little to like about Kay and the novels that she pens always end with her protagonists dying. Since she cannot finish her latest novel, which is about Harold, her publisher calls in an expert, Penny Escher (Queen Latifah of 'Mad Money'), who has established a solid track record for helping writers complete their books. Karen is obsessed about death and she calls her novel-in-progress, 'Death and Taxes', deriving the title from Benjamin Franklin's assertion that 'in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes'.Meanwhile, troubled Harold visits a psychiatrist, Dr. Mittag-Leffler (Linda Hunt of 'Silverado') and explains his incredibly weird predicament. She informs him that he is a schizophrenic. Harold disagrees with Mittag-Leffler's diagnosis. He believes that he is a character in a novel, so she refers him to literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman of 'Midnight Cowboy') who is as puzzled as he is intrigued by Harold. Hilbert puts his literary knowledge to work and tries to figure out what genre of fiction Harold belongs to: is he in a tragedy or a comedy. Eventually advises Harold to live life on his own terms. While he is struggling with his own lifestyle, Harold is in the process of auditing the tattooed owner of a bohemian-style bakery shop called 'The Uprising.' Ana Pascal (cute Maggie Gyllenhaal of 'Donnie Darko') hasn't been paying all of her taxes; she explains to Harold that she refuses to pay for the military part of her taxes because she considers it immoral. Initially, neither of them likes each other, but predictably over time, their attitudes change over time.Again, this is not the typical Will Ferrell movie. In fact, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is the kind of movie that you could watch several times and come away each time with something new. All the actors and actresses are at the top of their game. The wacky ending is about the only thing predictable in this interesting epic.",9,0,0,23 February 2008
The Green Mile," 'The Green Mile' Is A Lemon!
","Stephen King is a good writer, but he isn't one of my favorite authors. Please don't misinterpret my comments about Mr. King. Indisputably, King has a knack for knitting gripping horror yarns, but the warp factor in this fiction dilutes any satisfaction lately that his endings furnish. The twisted nature of good and evil that permeates his plots makes them as lurid as gory car accidents. You don't so much read Stephen King to enjoy a catharsis as you do to experience necrophobia.Frank Darabont made his Hollywood feature film debut five years ago as the director of 'The Shawshank Redemption.' Derived from a King novella, 'The Shawshank Redemption' became one of the top-grossing films of 1994, surpassing even 'Pulp Fiction!' When I saw 'The Shawshank Redemption' and later raved about it, little did I know that King had a claw in it. Incredibly, Darabont performed a miracle on 'Shawshank' and King. Not only did he make it palatable, but he also created a classic with a dramatically satisfying resolution. The good guys triumphed, and the bad guys got what they justly deserved! A Stephen King movie that neither grossed me out nor cheated me is an exercise in rare artistry.Although 'The Green Mile' shares similarities with 'The Shawshank Redemption,' the former falls short of the latter. A prison serves as the setting for each movie, and a black man and a white guy form a close relationship. Each film explores the themes of good and evil and the fragility of the human condition. Unlike the thoughtfully-paced and trimly-crafted 'Shawshank,' Darabont wallows indulgently in King's source material. King readers will applaud the reverence that Darabont lavishes on the literary master of the macabre. Nevertheless, 'The Green Mile' is a lemon that wears out its welcome long before it ends. Despite a terrific cast and its atmospheric production values, 'The Green Mile' is far too long, far too loquacious, and far too morbid. While this death row drama succeeds as an above-average character study, 'The Green Mile' could have been improved had Darabont left half of it on the cutting room floor.Not only did Darabont direct 'The Green Mile,' but he also penned the screenplay. Unimaginatively, he drags out everything ad nauseam. 'The Green Mile' clocks in at an appalling 187 minutes! Moreover, those three hours and seven minutes lack velocity. The initial 45 minutes elapse without complication, but the remaining 142 minutes lurch about in fits and starts. You'll be checking your watch at the two hour mark and wondering why the film has not made greater progress. Darabont dramatizes so much questionable material that he doesn't have time to accelerate either the momentum or urgency.Eventually, the shopworn plotting degenerates so much that you want to fast forward through those scenes that clog up the action. Darabont seems lost himself. 'The Green Mile' circles rather than moves in a straight line. He resorts to standard symbolic clichÃ©s, such as John Coffey's initials. Moreover, Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan of 'Armageddon) acts a Christ figure of sorts, because he was unfairly imprisoned for crimes he did not commit. When Coffey heals one guard and resurrects an animal, the comparison between Christ and Coffy is blatant. Movie rule #1: Animals must never die! Later, Coffey passes along part of his powers to Edgcomb whose first name was Paul. Catch the religious significance? The realism clashes unevenly with the fantasy. The 'Hogan's Heroes' antics are entertaining, but too much time is wasted on other characters that add nothing to the plot. Darabont directs as if he were watching a mini-series.Indeed, 'The Green Mile' boasts some powerfully emotional scenes, but the misguided scenes outnumber them. While confined largely to death row, 'The Green Mile' sprawls with considerable ethos, passion, and scope. Darabont weaves elements from 'Birdman of Alcatraz' (1962), 'Powder' (1995), and 'E.T: The Extraterrestrial' (1982). Darabont relates the story in one marathon flashback. Since Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks of 'Forrest Gump') never faces death, the flashback proves an acceptable storytelling device rather than anti-climactic, as it would be in lesser films where the hero appears in constant jeopardy. Edgecomb lives in a retirement home when we see him at first. He attends a screening of the Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers' musical 'Top Hat' (1935) in the facility. The memories that 'Top Hat' triggers sends Edgecomb out of the room in tears. A lady friend rushes to Paul's side, and he regales her with his exploits as a prison guard in the 1930s.Characters with depth and strength walk 'The Green Mile.' The action unfolds during the Great Depression in 1935 at Louisiana's Cold Mountain Prison where a gigantic 'Of Mice and Men' type African-American itinerant receives the death penalty for killing two little white girls. As the Chief of Guards on Death Row, Paul Edgecomb treats the inmates with respect and dignity. He supervises the arrival of John Coffey in E-Block. Coffey towers like Goliath over Edgecomb and his crew of guards, and he has to bend over to enter his cell. During Coffey's sojourn at Cold Mountain, Edgecomb discovers the miracles can occur in the most unlikely places.Sadly, the unsavory moments in 'The Green Mile' sabotage the memorable ones. Occasionally, you may even feel a mite green around the gills. The squeamish should look the other way during the electrocution scenes, especially when Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter of 'True Crime') dies in the chair. Of course, no American movie about life-behind-bars could resist commentary on capital punishment. Indeed, prison movies often qualify as thinly-veiled polemics against the death penalty. Clearly, the people at Warner Brothers who made 'The Green Mile' deplore the death penalty, but they relish poetic justice. At the last minute, The Green Mile' wades a little too deeply into the philosophical quagmire with its revelations about the protagonist. Altogether, the audience doesn't get any time off for good behavior.",7,1,2,12 September 2008
Dark Shadows," Embalmed Hilarity
","Tim Burton must have seemed the ideal choice to resurrect the most infamous television vampire Barnabas Collins and his relatives from the Gothic Dan Curtis black and white soap opera 'Dark Shadows' that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. Burton loves to make movies about eccentric people, and the folks lurking at Collinwood exemplify the eccentricity gone wild. The problem with Burton's campy but reverential homage to 'Dark Shadows' is that it is all wrong. Mind you, 'Dark Shadows' is nowhere as egregious as either Barry Sonnenfeld's 'Wild Wild West' or Todd Phillips's 'Starsky and Hutch.' The secret to 'Dark Shadows' is that most of its fans took it seriously despite its outlandish subject matter. I remember getting home from school as fast as I could to catch part of the show. The black & white videography with its 'live telecast' quality imbued the series with an eerie suspense. The siren-like music set to waves crashing convulsively against the rocks is something that I'll never forget. Remember, until Hammer introduced the Universal monsters in color, black and white was integral to horror. Now, whenever Hollywood has to fondly remember anything, it does so with a wink and a smirk. 'Dark Shadows' deserved better. 'Dark Shadows' deserves a straightforward adaptation. Kenneth Branagh might have been better suited and a two hour plus running time with all the seriousness of Kevin Costner's 'Dances with Wolves.' Instead, Burton skewers everybody and everything in sight. The only redeeming feature about 'Dark Shadows' is the way Burton wraps everything up in 1970's nostalgia, particularly with its evocative source music, whether it is The Moody Blues' 'Nights in White Satin' or a benign Carpenters' tune. If 'Dark Shadows' had never existed, the Burton film might have been heralded as a work of genius. As it is, this handsomely produced homage looks as polished as anything Burton has ever done. Of course, if Burton had take the same approach that he did—playing things straight—with his 'Planet of the Apes' reboot, 'Dark Shadows' might have been fun. Often, I struggle to bring myself around to the filmmaker's perspective and give them the benefit of the doubt. Even with the benefit of the doubt, 'Dark Shadows' is a misfire, but I suppose that it could have been infinitely worse.",5,4,8,20 June 2012
Hancock," There Is Nothing Half-Cocked About 'Hancock!'
","The Will Smith superhero saga 'Hancock,' co-starring Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman, qualifies as the most original superhero movie of summer 2008. Indeed, 'Friday Night Lights' director Peter Berg with 'Hostage' scenarist Vincent Ngo and 'X-Files' writer Vince Galligan devote themselves entirely to the origins of their offbeat and unusual titan and leave everything wide open for an inevitable sequel. This amusing, irreverent, occasionally violent comedy-drama boasts a dynamic cast, a tidy 92-minute running time, and an inventive premise brimming with audacity that more than compensates for its chief liability, shoddy computer generated special effects that appear campy rather than cool. As much as 'Hancock' poke fun at superheroes, it also details the disadvantages that come with being a superhero. Adam Sandler got the ball rolling earlier with 'You Don't Mess with the Zohan' where he played an ordinary guy with superhero characteristics. 'Hancock' takes the ordinary guy with superhero powers like 'Zohan' to even greater heights. The closest that anybody has come to making something like 'Hancock' is the cable series 'Smallville' where young Clark Kent never dons superhero spandex, but he possesses the power to thwart evil. Basically, 'Hancock' is an enigmatic hero. The filmmakers assail us with his superhuman feats and the troubles that he spawns long before they reveal his origins. Unlike all superheroes, Hancock is a homeless guy who guzzles far too much liquor for his good. However, when adversity arises, Hancock can hurl himself into the air and through the skies at supersonic speeds to settle the score. Bullets ricochet off his impervious physique, and he can hoist things ten times his own weight. Hancock's problem is his unruly attitude. He wrestles with an anger management problem. Further, he creates more problems than he solves with his superhero powers. In the opening scene, for example, he rids Los Angeles of three Asians joyriding in a white SUV on the freeway who blasting away motorists with sub-machine guns. Hancock rips the roof off their SUV and suggests they surrender. They try to riddle him with lead, but they only obliterate his whiskey bottle. Hancock is so upset at the loss of good liquor that he digs his heels into the pavement and halts their SUV. Afterward, he flies away with them screaming in their SUV and impales the vehicle on the tower of the Capitol Records building. Everybody in Los Angeles hates Hancock, and they wish he would leave the city.Hancock's salvation lies with a schmucky public relations guru, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman of 'The Kingdom'); Hancock saves Ray when poor Ray finds himself trapped in traffic gridlock at a railroad crossing. Naturally, Hancock creates more havoc when he tries to help out society. He flips Ray's car onto another vehicle and stops the locomotive dead on its tracks with his body. Predictably, a string of boxcars connected to the engine jackknife and pile up into huge mess. Since Hancock saves his life, Ray repays him with his public relations savvy. Ray convinces Hancock to serve time in prison as a way to gain the respect of the public. The District Attorney has leveled lots of charges against the superhero, but he has had no way to make them stick. Initially, Hancock hates Ray's plan, but Ray assures him that the crime on the streets that results from his absence will prompt the police chief to spring him from prison. Mind you, it doesn't take long for a real scumbag to rise to the occasion and take hostages in a bank robbery. Meantime, Ray has gotten Hancock to shave, soften his image, complement the authorities for a job well done, and don an X-Men style flight suit. At this point, 'Hancock' takes a surprising turn and veers off into another direction. 'Hancock' looks a little like 'Highlander' in this respect as the filmmakers provide everything that we need to know about him that ties up all the loose ends.'Hancock' is a refreshing change of pace for a superhero movie. Good movies take chiseled-in-stone conventions and shatter them for maximum effect. This superhero satire delivers beautifully with its reinvention of the superhero. Will Smith gets to play a character with some tragic depth and he undergoes change later on during the course of the action. Alas, the special effects are pretty substandard, and the vengeful villain named Red (Eddie Marsan of 'Mission Impossible 3') never poses a serious challenge to 'Hancock.' In fact, Ray comes to Hancock's rescue in another surprising turnabout. The biggest surprise of the movie is 'Æon Flux' actress Charlize Theron. She plays Ray's meek, mild-mannered wife Mary. She turns out to be more than anybody bargained for, including our super-heroic superhero. Saying anymore about Mary would spoil the surprise about her character. Altogether, despite is obvious faults, 'Hancock' ranks as Will Smith's best science fiction fare since 'Men-in-Black.'",8,1,2,16 July 2008
Kong: Skull Island," The Best 'King Kong' Remake Since The Original
","Nobody is ever going to top the classic 'King Kong' (1933) with Fray Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot. You may complain it is too old, too contrived, and too black & white. Sure, it is, but it remains an archetypal fantasy, and it altered the way Hollywood made movies. Few may concern themselves about its legacy, and the ignorant will never know how 'King Kong' shaped the cinematic future. Meanwhile, Hollywood keeps on trying to surpass the legendary Merian C. Cooper & Ernest B. Schoedsack classic. Although 'Kings of the Summer' director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and three scribes: Dan Gilroy of 'The Bourne Legacy,' Max Borenstein of the rebooted 2014 'Godzilla,' and Derrick Connelly of 'Jurassic World' have taken liberties with the formulaic narrative, they have created an entertaining but audacious action & adventure epic that should rattle anybody's cage. Principally, Vogt-Roberts and his writers have eliminated some tragic events critical in previous 'King Kong' remakes. Indeed, the title 'Kong: Skull Island' tells all in this captivating reboot. Aside from its double-pronged prologue that establishes the basics, virtually everything takes place on Skull Island. I know what you're thinking: Vogt-Roberts and company linger so long on Skull Island that they are saving the rest for Kong saga sequels like Peter Jackson when he produced 'The Hobbit.' Okay, might be a possibility. If you stick around after the end credits, you'll see a scene that charts the future for 'Kong' sequels. Paying close attention to those end credits may raise some questions that the after-the-end-credits stinger answers. This is one scene you need to stick around for after everybody else has left. Whatever the case, 'Kong: Skull Island' deviates from previous Kongs (maybe not the 1962 Toho Studio release 'King Kong Vs. Godzilla'), and the relationships among the humans and their interactions with Kong have been changed with the introduction of entirely different characters. Altogether, these changes in 'Kong: Skull Island' create an interesting variation on the parable of this prodigious primate. Clocking in at 120 minutes with larger-than-life action galore, 'Kong: Skull Island' does one thing better than its predecessors. Namely, the humans are more interesting and compelling than the beasts. Actor John C. Reilly virtually steals the show as a supporting character. Second, the filmmakers have dreamed up a premise that makes the setting justifiable rather than capricious. 'Kong: Skull Island' unfolds during World War II as an Allied aviator, Lieutenant Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly of 'Step Brothers'), bails out of his flaming P-51 fighter. No sooner has Marlow landed safely than the Japanese pilot, Gunpei Ikari (Japanese singer-songwriter Miyavi), who shot him down endures a similar fate. Marlow empties his .45 automatic pistol at his adversary, but he misses with all shots. The Nipponese pilot cannot shoot with any greater accuracy, so it boils down to Marlow dodging his enemy who discards his firearm and wields his Kantana sword. Locked into a life and death struggle, Marlow and his foe get the surprise of their lives when a skyscraper-sized gorilla interrupts their hand-to-hand fight. Afterward, the action shifts to 1975 and the twilight of the Vietnam War, as President Richard M. Nixon announces that America is calling it quits in Southeast Asia. Meantime, an enigmatic figure from the scientific Monarch agency, William 'Bill' Randa (John Goodman of '10 Cloverfield Lane'), persuades reluctant Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins of 'Jack Reacher') to let him piggy-back on a government mission to explore an anonymous island recently spotted by satellites. Willis agrees, but only because the Soviets have not obtained similar satellite images. Randa has acquired a dubious reputation because he witnessed a monster attack a U.S. Navy vessel and kill everybody aboard except himself. Since this incident, everybody has labeled him a crackpot. Accompanying Randa to Vietnam is Yale geologist Huston Brooks (Corey Hawkins of 'Iron Man 3'), and they hire former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston of 'Thor') who knows how to find soldiers lost in the jungle. Finally, Randa recruits U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Unbreakable') and his Sky Devils helicopter assault squadron. Packard has the option of either going back to America or signing up for this mysterious mission. Incensed by Nixon's withdrawal from Vietnam, Packard accepts the mission because he wants to do something heroic before he leaves the hemisphere. Packard is Draconian to the max. He completes missions, and he leaves the enemy a sight worse than he found them, until he takes The Sky Devils to Skull Island. Lastly, another civilian, an attractive photo-journalist, Mason Weaver (Brie Larson of 'Trainwreck'), joins them at the last minute. Larson's character isn't as helpless as previous 'King Kong' damsels. Unlike her predecessors, she doesn't form as memorable a relationship with Kong.Treacherous weather conditions have concealed Skull Island from mankind since creation. Storms crackling with jagged lightning and impenetrable clouds besiege the island. Some civilians dispatched to the island balk at entering those ominous clouds. Colonel Packard refuses to allow anything as trifling as weather interfere with his objectives. The Sky Devils launch from a cargo ship. Momentarily, 'Kong: Skull Island' pays tribute to the vintage Vietnam era film 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) as the choppers fly. Packard and company are not prepared for what they encounter after launching small bombs for seismic readings. Kong clashes with the Sky Devils in a sensational battle. The climactic scene in John Guillermin's 'King Kong' (1976), when choppers surrounded Kong atop the World Trade Center in New York City, clearly inspired this fight. After Kong destroys all the choppers, our heroes find themselves afoot on an island teeming with savage predators. Watching Tom Hiddleston play a conventional hero is a refreshing change. The way that various characters die reflects that wildlife that eats them. However, no death is too gruesome to observe. The MPAA has rated 'Skull Island' as PG-13 for 'intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language.'",8,1,4,27 March 2017
Hitch," If You've Got An Itch For Will Smith, Watch 'Hitch!'
","Charismatic Will Smith plays an ethically-minded, financially-upscale, Manhattan matchmaker in 'Hitch,' an artificial but entertaining romantic comedy about a guy who earns his keep as a love counselor. 'Sweet Home Alabama' director Andy Tennant's new movie recalls earlier dating comedies, like the superlative 'Two Can Play That Game' (2002) where the sexes forged surefire rules for the game of love, only to discover that the rules don't guarantee love. Actually, 'Two Can Play That Game' goes down a lot better than 'Hitch.' Feminists won't care for the way that 'Hitch' portrays most young women as shallow, passive creatures without a clue who await Prince Charming to sweep them off their feet. The only mature female here is a supporting character who plays a wife that practices psychiatry. She sees through Will Smith's co-star Hispanic beauty Eve Mendes of 'Out of Time,' a tabloid gossip columnist who wants to expose our protagonist for his perfidy. In other words, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy winswell, you should know by now where this overlong, but frothy, formulaic fodder inevitably takes audiences.Think of 'Hitch' as a chick flick for guys about gals, and you'll appreciate it's contagious, upbeat, effervescent sparkle. This family friendly, PG-13 rated, courtship comedy shuns steamy sex scenes, though it features a couple of chaste morning after scenes. Instead, director Andy Tennant and first-time scenarist Kevin Bisch focus on the pursuit of love rather than the conquest. Generally, plots about the pursuit receive a PG-13 rating, while plots about conquest carry an R-rating for their overt sexuality. Essentially, 'Hitch' boils down to a book of rules for guys that date. For example, Hitch explains his clients: 'Eight out of 10 women believe that the first kiss will tell them everything they need to know about a relationship.' Several humorous scenes liven up the predictable plot, especially the 90%-10% kiss rule. After a shaky start during his college days as a loser of a Lothario, Hitch turned his life around and discovered his knack for knowing what women want. As a result, he has gone into business as a date doctor, made a good living for himself, but he has not forgotten his ethics. Hitch refuses to coach any cad who only wants a one-night-stand rather than a long-term, matrimonial relationship. One such womanizer tries to take advantage of Hitch, so he can carve a notch on another conquest. An indignant Hitch twists the guy's arm and pins him to a table with a warning never to bother him again. Clearly, Hitch is one of the few big-screen characters that you could invite home to supper without a second thought. He is a nice guy who turns frogs into princes. The principal frog here is a shy, chubby, bespectacled accountant, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), who cannot keep his eyes off celebrity socialite Allegra Cole (former model Amber Valletta). Sara and her photographer shadow Allegra and snap photos of Albert and Allegra. Suddenly, Albert becomes an overnight celebrity himself, something that he doesn't enjoy. That's about the time that suave, smooth-talking Hitch hits on Sara. Believing the worst about Hitch, Sara suspects that his ethics are no deeper than a gutter, so she decides to bust him. You've seen this nonsense a dozen times before, but the stars make it work.Happily, 'Hitch' redeems Smith after his disastrous sci-fi epic 'I, Robot' where he stuck his foot in his Asimov. Interestingly, Smith doesn't pack heat in this picture, doesn't play an authority figure, and relies primarily on his sense of timing and delivery to sell himself and 'Hitch.' Surprisingly, 'Hitch' represents Smith's first foray into comedy since 'Six Degrees of Separation' (1993) before he started to impersonate hard-fisted action heroes. Chicago-born director Tennant understands perfectly that nobody can upstage Will Smith, especially when Smith lets his star wattage shine. Mind you, Kevin James gives Smith competition. You know a movie is in trouble when the scenes between the guys are funnier than the ones between the guys and the gals. Nevertheless, it won't be long before sexy Eve Mendes should attain stardom in her own right, like Sondra Bullock, Jennifer Lopez, or Halle Berry. Although she isn't the clown that Kevin James of the TV sitcom 'The King of Queens' portrays to perfection, she plays a great misguided antagonist with issues.As Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, Will Smith reverts back to his TV days as the 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.' The 'Bad Boys' superstar hasn't shown this spontaneity in years. Even when he's doing nothing more than a comic routine, Smith radiates charisma, especially when he embarrasses himself in a freshman college scene or when he suffers from a food allergy. Clocking in at a little over two hours, 'Hitch' could have used some judicious editing. Tennant lets several scenes run overtime after he's made his points. Basically, you see Hitch, Eve, and Albert in their own separate scenes or together. The Eve scenes aren't as funny, because they advance the plot more than the humor. After all, she qualifies as the villain. The scenes between Hitch and Albert look one step away from the famous comedy team of Abbott and Costello. The rest of the cast is strictly there to support these three, and they make their stock characters seem more lively than usual.If you've got an itch to see Will Smith as you've never seen him, check out 'Hitch.'",6,0,0,17 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Bland Conclusion to 'Star Wars' cycle
","Writer & director George Lucas takes about two hours and twenty minutes to wrap up his popular, long-running 'Star Wars' sci-fi franchise with 'Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith,' the sixth, latest and certainly not last installment in his multi-generational galactic extravagance. 'Star Wars' fans who consider themselves completists undoubtedly will savor Lucas' fill-in-the-blank storytelling skills. Those moviegoers less enamored of this cinematic phenomenon, however, may find themselves excited by the spectacular CGI special effects but jaded by the garrulous exchanges of dialogue. All things considered, 'Revenge' amounts to standard-issue entry in a largely light-hearted franchise. Compared with 'Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' and 'Episode 2: Attack of the Clones,' the anticlimactic 'Episode 3' proves more implausible but entertaining, perhaps because Lucas shoehorns in so much information into an otherwise shallow plot, so that he can come full circle with his groundbreaking 1977 classic 'Star Wars' that gave science fiction films a new lease on life. Like 'Attack of the Clones,' 'Revenge' suffers from the ghastly casting of stiff, inexpressive Hayden Christensen as heroic Anakin Skywalker. Christensen fills the role the same way cement fills a hole. Moreover, Lucas bungles Christensen's dramatic make-over from a humble Jedi Knight to one of the cinema's most despicable villains: Darth Vader. Christensen's leaden performance combined with the less than convincing logic that prompts Anakin to cross over to the dark side undercuts the dramatic clout. Poor Natalie Portman could have phoned in the second-rate, soap opera-like dialogue that she delivers with more conviction that it deserves. She appears barefoot, pregnant, and wears the oddest-looking night gown strung with beads strung across her shoulders. Not only does Lucas provide few surprises to liven up this fairly formulaic potboiler, but also the way that he ties the movies together lacks imagination.Ironically, while it ranks as the worst 'Star Wars' movie, 'Revenge' opens with one of the biggest, slam-bang battle sequences of the series. Of course, it looks like a variation on the Death Star attack in the original 'Star Wars.' Lucas displays his unparalleled mastery over all special effects computer-generated again and plunges us into of an explosive, hyperactive, roller-coaster ride of a ruckus that sends Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor of 'Black Hawk Down') and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen of 'Life As A House') dodging and weaving evasively through an armada of gargantuan space cruisers in their smaller, fleeter, fighter ships. At one point, insect-like droids attach themselves to Obi-Wan's ship and start drilling holes in his ship to disable it. Sharp-shooting Anakin carefully blast them off the fuselage. Would that the remaining two hours of 'Episode 3' bristled with half as much action and excitement as the opening twenty minutes! Obi-Wan and Anakin hurl themselves recklessly into certain peril to save the abducted Chancellor Palpatine (Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid of 'Dragonslayer') from General Grievous.Immediately, Lucas shows how Anakin's powers have grown since 'Attack of the Clones.' The close proximity that Anakin finds himself in with a grateful Chancellor Palpatine foreshadows our protagonist's inevitable conversion to evil. Christopher Lee fans won't be surprised that Count Dooku bites the dust during the last half of the first battle sequence. At the same time, Obi-Wan has developed closer ties to Anakin that the former considers the latter more a brother than a student. Meanwhile, trying to conceal their attraction to each other so that one can serve on the senate and another can remain a Jedi, Anakin and Padme Amidala (beautiful Natalie Portman of 'The Professional') worry about her pregnancy. Chiefly, Anakin fears that Padme will perish in childbirth as his own mother. Therefore, he is prepared to sacrifice his beliefs to ensure the survival of both Padme and her offspring. The character of Padme recalls passive females from the 1950s prohibited from carrying firearms or showing initiative. Feminists will definitely give this image of women in film a big thumbs down. Of course, the Jedi Council consisting of Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Coach Carter') suspect Chancellor Palpatine of treason and lack confidence in Anakin when they refuse to confer upon him the title of Jedi Master, despite the fact he is the youngest Jedi ever to sit on the Council. More than any other character, Anakin stands as the cornerstone of 'Revenge.' Everything revolves around Anakin's reactions. Eventually, Anakin finds himself torn between his suspicious Jedi Masters and the scheming Palpatine of the Senate.Reportedly, George Lucas called on his 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' alumnus Steven Spielberg to choreograph the light saber sequences. Sadly, the duels between Dooku and Anakin and later Anakin and Obi-Wanseem are little more than symbolic dances of death designed to consume time. You know Anakin will emerge triumphant in each outing otherwise the franchise would sacrifice continuity. The best of this predictable light saber duels takes place between Palpatine and Yoda. Consistently, a combatant will spin around to counter a thrust or execute a gravity defying back-flip. The problem is you know you're watching human heads grafted onto bogus CGI figures. The climactic battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan lasts for what seems a veritable lifetime. Indeed, the computer-generated special effects are hopelessly enthralling, with more CGI shots here than in 'Episodes 1 and 2' combined. However, while special effects can enhance a movie, they cannot compensate for inferior plotting and cheesy dialogue. Other traditional 'Star Wars' characters get the short shrift, such as the furry, dog-like Chewbacca, who appears briefly in one scene set on his native planet.The basic shortcoming of the more darkly themed 'Revenge of the Sith' is that in tying up all the loose ends, George Lucas has helmed the least exciting, most talkative, and altogether dullest 'Star Wars' movie. While hardcore 'Star Wars' fans will welcome this full circle narrative treatment, most newcomers to the franchise will either be underwhelmed or just plain baffled by all the exposition that can only be appreciated by watching the other five films.",7,2,5,10 May 2007
Shooter," Not Quite A Bullseye, But Close Enough!!!
","If you read Stephen Hunter's absorbing conspiracy thriller 'Point of Impact,' you may have issues with the cinematic adaptation from 'Training Day' director Antoine Fuqua and 'The Devil's Advocate' scenarist Jonathan Lemkin who also penned the story for 'Lethal Weapon 4.' Fuqua and Lemkin left a lot out of the movie that made Hunter's novel both compelling and suspenseful. Primarily, the time that the film took place has been altered drastically from Vietnam where our hero was a sniper to a hush hush massacre in Africa where hundreds of innocent women and children were slaughtered without a qualm for oil and money. 'Shooter' is the title that Paramount Pictures replaced Hunter's 'Point of Impact,' and Mark Wahlberg plays the steely-eyed protagonist, former Marine Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger, who is duped into working with a patriotic organization assigned to protect the president. Actually, what these devious dastards, led by a smarmy Danny Glover, are setting up is a frame to fit the unsuspecting Swagger. An African archbishop is assassinated in public view while receiving a medal from POTUS, and Bob Lee—who came along to watch the ceremony—makes a miraculous escape. FBI Agent Nicholas Memphis collides with him, and Bob Lee not only disarms him adroitly but also steals his official Bureau cruiser to make his getaway. Eventually, these two will team up, but the dastards who tried to kill Bob Lee start to tie off any loose ends, and they kill the uniformed policeman who shot Bob Lee during the assassination in Baltimore. Although it isn't as faithful as it could have been to Hunter's impressive novel with its plethora of history, 'Shooter' still qualifies as a polished, well-made, actioneer. Fuqua knows how to orchestrate these films, and he has proved that he knows what he's doing with 'The Replacement Killers,' 'The Equalizer,' and 'The Magnificent Seven.' Fuqua's audio commentary on the DVD is exemplary, and you will learn a lot about nothing only the movie but also some of the things that happened during the production. Since he doesn't mention Stephen Hunter's name once during his commentary, Fuqua must not have been familiar with it. Ned Beatty of 'Deliverance' fame makes a first-rate villain.",9,4,5,11 December 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It!
","Director Kenneth Branagh's cinematic adaptation Agatha Christie's classic whodunit 'Murder on the Orient Express' qualifies as lush, atmospheric, but sadly pretentious. Clearly, Branagh and 'Blade Runner 2049' scenarist Michael Green don't subscribe to the adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' This big-screen remake doesn't surpass director Sidney Lumet's superior version from 1974 that c0-starred Sean Connery, Michael York, Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Richard Widmark, and Anthony Perkins. Branagh doesn't muster a cast the caliber of the Lumet version, and he wears out his welcome with a running time that clocks in mysteriously under two hours. The Lumet version was far longer, but it rolls back a lightning speed. Branagh and Green have maintained the same time period, but they have changed up some of the murder suspects. The austere British colonel that Connery portrayed has been replaced with an African-American doctor who is having an amorous relationship with a Caucasian lady. Unlike the Christie novel, the film doesn't have the train come to a stop because of too much snow on the tracks, but because the train has derailed. Furthermore, Branagh and Green have tacked on a prologue that is entirely dispensable. Honorable mention must go to Jim Clay and his production designs as well as the set decorators. If you have read the Christie novel, you will not be surprised at anything that happens, except for Hercule Poirot's OCD that enables him to ferret out the criminals. If you haven't see the Lumet version and you haven't read the novel, you may find the film rewarding. Nevertheless, Lumet's version tops Branagh's rendition.",6,0,1,13 December 2017
Defiance," Survival of the Jewish!!!!
","What director Edward Zwick did for African-Americans during the American Civil in his movie 'Glory,' he does for Jewish refugees in his World War II combat epic 'Defiance.' Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell play three heroic Jewish brothers who fled from Nazi-held Poland into the Belarussian forest, marched hundreds of Jews into the wilderness, built a camp, and hid them from Hitler's murderous troops. Naturally, the Brothers Bielski clashed among themselves, and Zus (Live Schreiber) went off and fought with the Soviets, while Tuvia acted like Moses and provided food, water, and camaraderie for these exiled Jews. Unfortunately, no matter how stirring the combat scenes are, 'Defiance' is a conventional World War II movie that benefits immeasurably from a true story. Zwick and 'Under Fire' scenarist Clayton Frohman adapted Nechama Tec's non-fictional account 'Defiance: The Bielski Partisans.' After Zus joins the Soviets, he discovers the latent anti-Semitism within the ranks. Meantime, Tuvia learns about the price of leadership. He has to orchestrate the large population that he conceals in the wood and feed them. Tuvia orders that the women be trained to handle firearms. He dispatches food patrols and monitors the Nazis, but disputes break out when the fighters who found the food insist on having greater shares. The problem with 'Defiance' is that Zwick relies on clichés galore when this compelling narrative could have sacrificed most of the clichés. The logistics of trooping around these Jewish refugees are colossal. At one point, a Jewish man tells them that they cannot do the impossible, and Asael Bielski reminds them that they have already done the impossible. The combat scenes are staged vividly by Zwick and lenser Eduardo Serra. World War II fanatics will enjoy this above-average yarn.",8,0,2,30 October 2015
Lord of War," Better An Expose Than Entertainment
","In director Andrew Niccol's new movie 'Lord of War' (**1/2 out of ****), likable Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, an amoral globe-trotting merchant of death who sells weapons of all sorts to sadistic, Third World African dictators committed to the concept of tyranny and self-aggrandizement. You've haven't seen Cage in such a singularly unsympathetic role since John Woo's 1997 bullet-blasting blockbuster 'Face/Off.' Nevertheless, despite the lack of sympathy that his gun running character elicits, Cage's charisma shines through this unsavory veil, and he creates a genuinely affable persona. You can't help but like Yuri Orlov, because this devilish but friendly Cage character manages somehow to avoid getting his hands dirty. Truly, he is the man caught in the middle, a victim of circumstances that he manipulates to make a fast buck in a world gone mad. Indeed, he qualifies as the hero--or at the very least the protagonist, because 'Lord of War' covers the ups and downs of his 20-years as one of the world's notorious armaments salesmen.Appearances are deceptive in any movie that New Zealand native Andrew Niccol has either written or directed. Does anybody remember the cold, cruel, procrustean society of his 1997 sci-fi saga 'Gattaca?' Although he didn't call the shots on the offbeat 1998 epic 'The Truman Show,' Niccol wrote the film's thought-provoking screenplay about a man (Jim Carrey) trapped in a world that consists entirely of artifice. Lied to from birth, 'The Truman Show' hero eventually learns that others have manipulated his whole life, so that his life has become the subject of the top-ranked TV reality show. Niccol penned, produced, and directed the featherweight Al Pacino comedy 'S1m0ne' (2002) about a movie director who uses CGI to create a new female superstar, because he can no longer tolerate unruly, uncooperative starlets.In 'Lord of War,' Niccol flips everything upside down. He transforms the traditional villain into a hero and makes his embodiment of law and order--a straight-shooting, fair & square Interpol agent--into an adversary as pesky as any horsefly. As movies go, 'Lord of War' shatters one convention after another, some for good, others not so good, and its politically incorrect agenda is undoubtedly going to alienate some audiences, not only because Cage is the bad guy that we are supposed to identify with, but also because some may find the violence objectionable. Squeamish audiences will flinch when bullets perforate heads and send blood spraying across the wall behind their victims. Not surprisingly, 'Lord of War' bears an R-rated that reflects its over-the-top, ironic indictment of international arms dealing while it ridicules the hypocrisy of super-powers that cloak their complicity with freebooters like Yuri. Heavy-handed and factual to the nth degree (reportedly a real arms dealer supplied them with genuine tanks), 'Lord of War' is a glossy-looking movie that is too clever for its own good. The imaginative but jolting opening credits chronicle the life of a bullet from the factory to a machine gun and then through a child's cranium.The major problem with 'Lord of War' is that Niccol spends too much time exposing the international arms racket rather than dramatizing the exploits of a cavalier gun runner. The Nicolas Cage characterthe son of Ukrainian immigrants in Brooklyn who discovers a future in gun running after he witnesses a gunfight at a restaurantqualifies as the only three-dimensional character. Everybody else lurks on the periphery. When they disappear from the film for stretches, like Yuri's troubled brother Vitalty (Jared Leto of 'Alexander'), we don't miss them. Initially, Cage's Yuri Orlov breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience. Afterward, he narrates in intermittent voice-overs, not unlike the leads in director Martin Scorsese's Mafia bio-pics such as 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino,' and provides us with a profile of a gun runner. For example, Yuri warns us: 'The first and most important rule of gun-running is: never get shot with your own merchandise.' Yuri has no conscience. He sells to whoever can pay. The best day of his life occurs when the Soviet Union collapses. He bribes a high-ranking relative in the military to sell him a vast stockpile of tanks, AK-47 assault rifles, and helicopters. Acquiring this hoard is one thing, Yuri must now wrestle with the logistics of shipping the weapons to his clients without Agent Jack Valentine (Oscar-winner Ethan Hawk of 'Training Day') busting him. This rivalry between Yuri and Valentine resembles a Warner Brothers cartoon with Yuri as the Roadrunner and Valentine as Wiley Coyote. Meantime, when he isn't orchestrating arms sales, he courts super-model Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan of 'Coyote Ugly'), but keeps her in the dark about his work. Indeed, Yuri's encounters with murderous African warlords generate more drama than his marriage to his trophy wife, his cocaine-addicted brother, and the ever vigilant Valentine.Clocking in at over two hours, 'Lord of War' wears mighty thin before fade out. Okay, Cage gets in several clever lines of dialogue, like 'Where there's a will, there's a weapon.' Literally, since this amounts to a one-man show, nobody else makes much of an impression. Although his Ukraine accent may be questionable, Cage gives a polished, nuanced performance, too bad that 'Lord of War' couldn't have been half as assured and incisive as Cage's thesping. The audacious satire in Niccol's script lacks the sting of a Stanley Kubrick black comedy such as 'Dr. Strangelove' (1964) or Richard Brooks' 'Wrong Is Right' (1982), a Sean Connery thriller about terrorists blowing themselves up in America. Overall, 'Lord of War' achieves more urgency as a cynical, fact-filled expose about gun runners and the governments that sanction their efforts than a satisfying, catharsis-inducing actioneer where everything resolves itself in less than two hours.",Null,0,1,19 June 2007
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes Rebooted!
","The last man you would imagine as the ideal producer for 'Sherlock Holmes' is none other than high-octane 'Lethal Weapon' producer Joel Silver. Nevertheless, between action movie maestro Silver and audacious British director Guy Ritchie, the English counterpart to Martin Scorsese when it comes to making English mobster movies, Silver and Ritchie constitute a dynamic duo. Similarly, American actor Robert Downey, Jr., would seem least qualified to incarnate Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal sleuth, but the 'Iron Man' star makes it a neat fit. Well, neat might not be the appropriate word. While hygiene proves to be an annoyance to him, Robert Downey as Sherlock Holmes is nothing short of brilliant when he comes to making flawless deductions that would never occur to the less observant. Holmes notices the minutest detail, and he is forever cataloguing facts as well as experimenting with his own inventions, such as a handgun silencer. Silver and Ritchie have assembled a top-notch cast, including Jude Law, Mark Strong, and Rachel McAdams. Mind you, Holmes purists may hoist their supercilious eyebrows when they learn that Downey shuns the indispensable Basil Rathbone deerstalker cap and maintains a disheveled appearance. Incidentally, Rathbone played Holmes more times than anybody else in the Twentieth Century Fox/Universal Pictures franchise between 1939 and 1946. Meanwhile, Silver and Ritchie have lovingly recreated the Victorian setting in London during the 1890s, complete with Holmes' rooms at 221B Baker Street. The latest Holmes strives to be more charismatic and less haughty than either Nicol Williamson in 'The Seven Per-Cent Solution' (1976) or Robert Stephens in 'The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes' (1970). Freshman scenarist Michael Robert Johnson, 'Invictus' scribe Anthony Peckman and Simon Kinberg of 'X-Men: Last Stand' have penned a preposterous but wholly entertaining screenplay that bristles with 130 minutes worth of serpentine twists and turns. You will definitely get your money's worth. 'Sherlock Holmes' pits Holmes with his faithful colleague, the dapper Dr. John Watson (Jude Law of 'Cold Mountain'), against the Voldemortian-style villain, Lord Blackwood (creepy Mark Strong of 'Body of Lies'), who conjures up more evil than Holmes has ever faced. The maniacal Blackwood invokes dark magic and kills helpless women to enhance his powers. Initially, Holmes and Watson thwart him from slaying his latest female victim. Scotland Yard's Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan of 'Miami Vice') packs the predator off to the poky for the inevitable date with the gallows that Blackwood so richly deserves for his dastardly crimes. Watson officiates as the doctor who confirms Blackwood's demise and signs the death certificate. No sooner has Blackwood been safely buried than the bugger shatters his tomb and walks the earth, creating hysteria in London, and making Watson look incompetent. Like any worthwhile villain, Blackwood has ambitious designs now that he is back among the living. Blackwood convinces everybody in London but Holmes that he possesses paranormal powers that make him indestructible. He plans to implement some sweeping changes in London as well as the world unless Holmes can thwart his evil designs.Robert Downey, Jr., and Jude Law generate the same chemistry that made Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in the 1940s Sherlock Holmes movies so popular. Unlike Bruce's bumbling Watson, Law is treated as an intelligent equal to Holmes and they carry on some lively conversations. Usually, Watson isn't given much to do in these adventures, but Law shares a greater part of the burden. In 'Sherlock Holmes,' Watson dresses like a GQ Victorian gentleman and plans to marry Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly of 'Pride & Prejudice'), and Holmes does everything possible to prevent it. Incidentally, the character Mary Morstan appears in the Doyle novel 'The Sign of Four' as Watson's lady friend. Meanwhile, Holmes has his own hands full of a seductress, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams of 'The Notebook'), who likes to slip knock-out drops in his drink and leave him in embarrassing predicaments. Indeed, Adler appeared as a character in multiple Doyle stories about Holmes. She has been sent to confound Holmes by an unknown individual in a carriage who wears a derringer up his sleeve.Holmes and Watson's bickering seems even more amusing than the larger-than-life action set-pieces that Ritchie orchestrates with vigor and aplomb. The funniest scene has Holmes battling a towering French ruffian who literally destroys a dry dock. Ritchie doesn't direct 'Sherlock Holmes' like an ordinary mystery, but spruces it up with flash-forward scenes that dissect the action—usually Holmes' startling deductions—like something you would see in a 'C.S.I.' television episode. For example, in a 'Snatch' like scene where Holmes boxes with a superior opponent, our hero explains how he will topple his adversary with various blows and then Ritchie presents it in real time. People who hate the idea of Holmes as a pugilist should go back to the source material. Doyle describes Holmes as a formidable bare-knuckles brawler in the novel 'The Sign of Four' and Holmes even used martial arts against Moriarty in 'The Adventure of the Empty House.' Consequently, Holmes' boxing exploits are not a great stretch since his literary counterpart performed these feats in literature. When Holmes makes a deduction, Ritchie draws us back in time to when Holmes acquired his insight that prompted his deduction. The finale on the London Bridge, which is under construction, caps off this sprawling adventure. Whatever the case, 'Sherlock Holmes' represents the first time in twenty years that a film about Doyle's eccentric amateur detective has illuminated screens in America since the 1988 comedy 'Without a Clue' that starred Michael Caine as a fraudulent Holmes. Ultimately, your decision to see 'Sherlock Holmes' will rest on your willingness to accept the makeover that Holmes received. It is really not that radical a stretch when you remember the 1985 movie 'Young Sherlock Holmes' where Holmes and Watson were teenage colleagues. Most of what happens here with both characters can be traced back to the literary Holmes. Boasting brains and brawn, 'Sherlock Holmes' is anything but elementary.",10,3,6,29 December 2009
Prometheus," Ridley Doesn't Top Himself
","In a New York Times interview, 'Blade Runner' director Ridley Scott described his third science fiction film 'Prometheus' as ''2001' on steroids.' This comparison is entirely appropriate, particularly if you've seen the enigmatic but thought-provoking Stanley Kubrick epic about the evolution of mankind since the dawn of time. Scott's first 3-D spectacle ('Prometheus' is fun to watch once in 3-D) has elicited a wide variety of commentary since it arrived in theaters. Essentially, 'Prometheus' chronicles mankind's search for its origins. Two archeologists convince a wealthy corporate sponsor to create a spaceship that will transport them to the far reaches of the galaxy where they believe that they will find the answers to questions that the ancient etched in caves long ago. Of course, what they find is not what they wanted. Nevertheless, they do learn something not only about themselves but also their creators that will keep audiences arguing about the meaning of 'Prometheus' until the producers shed more celluloid on the situation. Ostensibly, 'Prometheus' qualifies as a quasi-prequel to Scott's own scary sci-fi saga 'Alien.' The chief difference is that 'Prometheus' isn't a tenth as horrifying. Nothing like the pugnacious pickle-shaped predator bursting from the chest of a human appears in this tame sci-fi opus. Meantime, Scott has stated that 'Prometheus' isn't a prequel. He concedes, however, that the seeds of 'Alien' have been sown into it. You cannot watch 'Prometheus' without thinking about 'Alien.' The 'Alien' space jockey—as it is referred to--appears in 'Prometheus' and so does an 'Alien' prototype. Furthermore, the story unfolds like 'Alien,' boasts a contemplative android, a tenacious female protagonist, and a couple of tentacled reptilian creatures icky enough to make you shrink in revulsion. The problem with 'Prometheus' is that it is more speculative than dramatic. Everybody about the physical appearance of 'Prometheus' looks dazzling. The technology and the equipment look like each belongs in the future. Some of the performances are extraordinary, too, especially Michael Fassbinder as a sophisticated android with a lethal sense of humor. Like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'Prometheus' spends more time contemplating our predicament rather than frightening the living daylights out of us above it.'Prometheus' opens on what appears to be planet Earth. We are treated to some awesome vistas as we fly above the sprawling terrain. A man in a cloak with alabaster-white skin and a muscularly sculpted physique walks up to a waterfall while a gigantic, saucer-shaped UFO hovers not far away. He takes the lid off a container and consumes some blackish goop. No sooner has he swallowed this nasty stuff than he suffers crippling spasms and plunges into the waterfall. The man's powerful body integrates and we see his DNA appear. As incredibly visual and mysterious as this scene is, you find yourself wondering exactly who this dude is and from whence he came. The next sequence finds a team of archeologists excavating a site in the year 2089 when Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Naomi Rapace of 'Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows') finds a star map on the wall of a cave. She summons her colleague, Dr. Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green of 'Brooklyn's Finest'), who also happens to be her boyfriend, and shows him a cave painting with a tall, thin, man pointing to an array a stars. The importance of this primitive drawing is that Shaw and Holloway have found similar examples of it around the world. They believe that they have discovered a star map that will take them to meet their creators. The next scene finds everybody aboard the Exploratory Vessel Prometheus in the year 2093 as an android, David (Michael Fassbinder of 'Centurion'), keeps track of them before they awaken from stasis. Once Dr. Shaw and Dr. Holloway along with their colleagues have gotten up and eaten, they meet the CEO of the Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce of 'Lockout'), whose billions have brought them into orbit around a faraway moon designated LV 223. He makes comments about the mission in a holographic presentation to them and then hands the briefing over to our heroes. Not long afterward, Weyland's dictatorial daughter, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron of 'Snow White and the Huntsman') informs them that they answer to her and she controls the mission. Basically, Vickers is the equivalent of Ellen Ripley from 'Alien.' She warns them not to contact any aliens until they have notified her about it.Our heroes, David, and their colleagues land on the surface of the moon near a gigantic structure and enter it wearing space suits. No sooner have they walked in than they discover that they can take off their helmets because they can breathe the air. They find a Mount Rushmore sized alien head in one of the rooms as well as mysterious vases that contain the black goop that the exterrestial sampled in the prologue. They also find tall, imposing aliens like the 'Alien' space jockey. Most of these fellows are dead and laying about in piles in what appears to be bunkers. David checks out a room teeming with vases. Their exploration is cut short because a storm is moving in and they are order to evacuate and return to the ship. Two of Shaw's colleagues are accidentally left behind. The captain of the spacecraft, Janek (Idris Elba of 'Ghost Rider, Spirit of Vengeance'), advises them to sit out the storm and await their arrival in the morning. Creepy things begin to happen and the two men encounter a snake-like creature that latches on to them. They are not prepared for what happens to them. Later, it turns out that Dr. Shaw has been contaminated with an organism in her body that resembles an embryro. She explains that she is not fertile and begins a mad dash to remove this organism from her body.The monsters in 'Prometheus' aren't as scary as the 'Alien' beasties. Meantime, this two hour-plus, R-rated potboiler will make you think about what didn't happen on screen more than what did.",8,1,6,8 June 2012
Halloween," An Excellent Slasher Saga . . .
","John Carpenter's 'Halloween' qualifies as both a trick and a treat.First, the unlikely notion that an independently-produced horror movie made for a miserly $320-thousand could amass $75-million dollars and remain popular twenty-two years afterward constitutes quite a trick. Incidentally, Carpenter took twenty days to shoot 'Halloween.' Not only did 'Halloween' catapult newcomer Jamie Lee Curtis to stardom {she reigned as the 'Scream Queen' in a spate of 'Halloween' knock-offs, like Paul Lynch's 'Prom Night' (1980) and Roger Spottiswoode's 'Terror Train' (1980)} but also it spawned six sequels of varying quality. Naturally, none surpasses the consummate skill and artistry of Carpenter's seminal slaughterhouse saga. Arguably, if Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' carved out a new sub-category for slashers among 1960s' horror movies, 'Halloween' hacked out a niche in cinematic history when it revived the genre. According to producer Irwin Yablans, 'Halloween 2' appeared primarily because scores of 'Halloween' clones came out and coined considerable box-office success. Second, 'Halloween' suffices as a treat because it focuses on far more than gratuitous blood & gore. Essentially, the film dwells on the cosmic issue of 'Evil' and Man's inability to combat both Evil and Fate as entities at work in our Universe.Carpenter directs with commendable restraint considering the genre. Anybody who pans 'Halloween' as tawdry and exploitative misses out on what elevates this minor chiller above its clones and makes it worth watching beyond the usual cursory viewings. Although it depicts savage violence, 'Halloween' spills pints rather than buckets of blood. If you're counting, three females and two males perish. He doesn't rely on sophisticated special effects or ghastly prosthetic make-up appliances. He generates tension, suspense, and nerve-wracking horror by deliberately pacing the action and doling out shocks and surprises. 'Halloween's' stark narrative simplicity propels it to its slang-bang ending. Carpenter and co-scenarist Debra Hill surgically pared down the plot to its absolute essentials. They relate a story with a beginning, middle, and an ending in straightforward fashion. Indeed, characterization remains deplorably one-dimensional, but the cast is convincing enough so it really doesn't matter. Moreover, they play roles that wouldn't experience radical growth over a 24 hour period, unless they wind up dying. Michael personifies Evil from start to finish. After he escapes from the Illinois State Hospital, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance of 'You Only Live Twice') sounds the alarm: 'The evil has gone from here!' Fate deploys Michael as an instrument, and Fate allows Michael to thrive with impunity in the end as the only truly phantasmagoric character. Essentially, 'Halloween' is a thriller with a monster for killer. The horrific elements of Michael's villainous appearance and his supernatural qualities make this a chiller. Visually, Carpenter links a classroom discussion of Fate to Michael as the killer sits parked outside Laurie's school in a station wagon. Furthermore, nothing superfluous clutters up the narrative, clocking in at a lean, mean 92 minutes. One scene depicts Dr. Loomis advocating Michael's prolonged incarceration in a mental institution. Of course, the squeamish should watch 'Halloween' in the company of somebody responsible, since the film concerns some unsavory themes, such as a murderous juvenile, a lunatic on the rampage with a blood lust nothing except death can quench, and the security of hospitals charged with keeping these maniacs locked-up behind bars. The irony of a psychiatrist who totes around a revolver with a gun permit and acts like a vigilante who shoots first and ask questions afterward represents still another topic for discussion.Carpenter and Hill confine the action to three acts. They set up the characters efficiently enough, introducing Michael first, then Dr. Sam Loomis, and finally Michael's victims. Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda comprise the trio of high school girls/victims that Michael sets out to slaughter. While Annie and Lynda are sexually active sirens, Laurie is the 'Girl Scout' of the group. She doesn't have a date for the school dance and is either shy or afraid to ask a guy out. She fits the classification of a sexually repressed girl, a character who typically survives the slasher because in a sense she reflects elements of his own repression. Once Michael makes the 150 mile drive to Haddonfield, the plot concerns when the characters converge on Lindsey Wallace's house where the murders transpire. Quotable dialogue reverberates throughout this slickly made white-knuckled thriller. During a telephone conversation, Laurie learns Annie has spoken to a guy the former has a crush on, and Laurie's responds: 'Are you fooling around again? Well, I'll kill you if this is a joke.' Despite a number of flaws and flubs, 'Halloween' has managed to withstand the ravages of time. One big question the original left blank dealt with Michael's apparent obsession with Laurie Strode. 'Halloween 2' accounts for this mystery in a way that 'The Empire Strikes Back' would alter Luke Skywalker's destiny. Ultimately, Michael epitomizes Evil incarnate as the inexorable catalyst in horror movies, just as the Terminator evokes a similar quality in science fiction. 'Halloween' adheres to several horror movie conventions. First, mankind can vanquish Evil with a capital E in battles but cannot altogether conqueror it. Generally, the best horror movies provide closure of the worst sort. The heroes may survive, but so too may the villains. Sure, the improbable ending with a villain recovering not only from a fall from a balcony but also six bullets weakens the credibility of 'Halloween.' Nevertheless, successful horror movies require larger-than-life monsters, and Michael attains a legendary status at fade-out by being able to waltz away with six slugs in him. Happily, Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis doesn't react with either surprise or alarm at Michael's resilience. Bullets cannot stop Michael because he possesses supernatural qualities. Little Tommy refers to Michael as the 'Bogeyman' and assures Laurie that nobody can kill the 'Bogeyman.' At fade-out, Laurie asks Loomis if Michael were the 'Bogeyman,' and he affirms that fact. No, you don't have to watch 'Halloween' only during the actual holiday itself to appreciate this seasonal chiller.",10,0,3,18 June 2008
Wonder Woman," Wonderful!
","The Adam West & Burt Ward 'Batman' (1966) movie qualified as the first costume-clad crime fighter epic of the modern era. Although women have figured prominently in all superhero sagas, DC Comics' latest superhero origins epic 'Wonder Woman' marks only the fifth big-screen actioneer that a woman has been cast as the title character. Earlier entries included 'Supergirl' (1984) with Helen Slater; 'Tank Girl' (1995) with Lori Petty; 'Catwoman' (2004) with Halle Berry; and 'Elektra' (2005) with Jennifer Garner. Unfortunately, these four films failed to recoup their respective budgets at the box office and never prompted sequels. (Before in the 1970s, Lynda Carter broke the TV barrier and portrayed William Moulton Marston's comic book creation Wonder Woman. She cavorted about a starry, patriotic costume with lots of cleavage for three seasons. For the record, the Wonder Woman character made her debut in DC Comics in their All-Star Comics in December 1941.) Anyway, 'Wonder Woman' is the only superhero movie about a heroine that has been both a smashing critical and commercial success. Finally, little girls and feminists alike have a larger-than-life heroine as a role model to applaud in the eternal struggle against evil. Meantime, Warner Brothers should have released 'Wonder Woman' before 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice.' The earlier blockbuster introduced audiences to the iconic Amazon warrior Princess Diana (Israel model Gal Gadot) with her incandescent Lasso of Truth and her ritualistic sword--something like King Arthur's Excalibur--who came to the rescue in the darkest hour of need to vanquish Lex Luthor's genetically mutated monster Doomsday. Sadly, Wonder Woman tangles with an adversary far less menacing than Doomsday in 'Monster' director Patty Jenkins' 'Wonder Woman.' Instead, she clashes with Zeus' son--the wicked God of War Ares--and triumphs over him. Primarily Indeed, 'Wonder Woman' is a movie told in flashback about the formative years of the heroine's life and the photograph taken of her with her ordinary male companions in World War I. Actress Gal Gadot will erase any memories of Lynda Carter, and 'Wonder Woman' ranks as a spectacular movie until she scrimmages with Ares who resembles the Wizard of Oz's Tin Man high on bath salts. Apart from that predictable climactic clash with Ares, 'Wonder Woman' ranks as an exciting, first-rate adventure opus about our heroine shedding her naÃ¯ve innocence as she blunders through an amoral world.'Wonder Woman' unfolds in contemporary Paris, at the illustrious Louvre Museum. Diana works as a Curator in the Department of Antiquities. A Wayne Enterprises armored car pulls up, and a uniformed guard delivers a locked valise to her office. Diana recognizes Bruce Wayne's logo on it. Opening the valise, she admires a sepia-colored daguerreotype of her in her Wonder Woman outfit with four troubleshooters posed with her. The significance of the photograph is that Wayne Enterprises, a.k.a. Batman, has sent her the original copy. The picture revives Diana's memories about her youth on the enchanted Uptonian island of Themyscira. Eight-year old Diana (newcomer Lilly Aspell) pleads to be an Amazon warrior, but her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen of 'Gladiator') refuses to let her sister Antiope (Robin Wright of 'Forrest Gump') train her to be a warrior. Hippolyta warns her daughter, 'Fighting doesn't make you a hero.' Later, she calls Diana 'the most precious thing in this world' to her. 'I sculpted you from clay myself and begged Zeus to give you life.' Eventually, Hippolyta relents but tells Antiope that Diana must be the best Amazon on the island. Moreover, she should be able to defeat even Antiope. Predictably, Diana (Gal Gadot of 'Fast Five') emerges from her training as the greatest Amazon ever. Initially, when Zeus created the island haven for the Amazons, he made it virtually impossible for anybody to find it. As she is standing on a cliff one day, Diana spots a plane as it penetrates the shield surrounding the island. The aircraft plummets into the ocean, and Diana plunges into the deep. She rescues a pilot from the sinking plane and carries him to the beach. Just as he recovers from the crash, Diana's mother Hippolyta and her warriors ride up on a cliff overlooking the beach and spot German ships breaking through the invisible barrier. Squads of German soldiers in the Kaiser's Imperial Army storm the beach and open fire on the Amazons. The intrepid pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine of 'Star Trek Beyond'), seizes a rifle from a soldier while the Amazon warriors let arrows galore fly at the Germans. Incredibly, the Amazons repulse them! Later, they learn from Trevor that he is an American secret agent working for the British. Moreover, he has stolen a valuable notebook from a notorious German chemist, Dr. Mara (Elena Anaya of 'Van Helsing'), who is testing a poison gas that will alter the outcome of the conflict.The refreshing thing about 'Wonder Woman' is her origins haven't been told ad infinitum like 'Superman,' 'Batman,' and 'Spider-man.' In fact, the set-up on Themyscira is one of the better parts, especially director Patty Jenkins' choreography of the German invasion and the bow and arrow wielding Amazons. Anyway, Diana learns about the global tragedy of World War I and decides the only way the war will end is when she slays Ares. Diana promises to help Steve Trevor escape from Themyscira if he will usher her to the war. She takes the Lariat of Hestia, an incandescent rope that prompts captives in this twine to utter only the truth, her magical bracelets, and an impressive sword nicknamed 'the Godkiller.' The next best scene occurs on a World War I battlefield. Wonder Woman emerges from the trenches and enters no-man's land. Germans from everywhere greet her with a hail of gunfire. She uses her magical bracelets to deflect their bullets. Gal Gadot acquits herself as well here as the eponymous character as she did in 'Batman Vs Superman.' Altogether, 'Wonder Woman' amounts to a dame good movie!",8,13,26,18 June 2017
Carrie," Disturbing, Demented, But Spectacular!!!
","'Scarface' director Brian De Palma had made about ten feature-length films and several shorts when he made his first classic horror chiller 'Carrie' with Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, John Travolta, William Katt, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, and P.J. Soles. If you look closely, you'll spot 'Miami Vice' regular Michael Talbot, who played Detective Stan Switek, cast as Travolta's accomplice. This was author Stephen King's first novel that Hollywood adapted, and he approved of De Palma and 'Ghost Story' scenarist Lawrence D. Cohen's adaptation. Performances are uniformly top-notch, with Spacek garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Actress while Laurie received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. These two make a convincing daughter and mother combination. Spacek is a revelation when she goes full-tilt telekinetic in the final quarter hour, devastating friends and foe alike. She walked off with the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. Amy Irving and Betty Buckley are sympathetic as Carrie's friend and mentor. Nancy Allen and John Travolta play a villainous who orchestrated an evening of mayhem with pig's blood galore. 'Carrie' is all about the terrible effects of bullying.Our poor, disadvantaged heroine grows up with a tyrannical mother whose husband abandoned her and turns into a radical Christian who sees sin in her innocent daughter. Furthermore, Carrie is an outsider at Bates High School, and her only friend is her gym teacher, Miss Collins (Betty Buckley of 'Wyatt Earp'), who struggles to help. Things get off to quick start after gym class one day when Carrie has her first period in the locker room shower. Virtually everybody ridicules Carrie's ignorance and they sling a storm of tampons and feminine napkins at her. Honestly, Carrie has no idea what is happening because her prudish, repressed mother has told her anything about growing up and the changes that occur with puberty. Miss Collins reprimands the girls and threatens to revoke their prom privileges if they don't spend time after classes with her performing calisthenics. Sue Snell (Amy Irving) regrets her behavior and arranges a prom date between her handsome football hero boyfriend, Tommy Ross (William Katt of 'Butch & Sundance: The Early Years'), who reluctantly goes along with her best intentions scheme. Meanwhile, Sue's class mate Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen of 'RoboCop') smolders with rage from the treatment that Miss Collins accords her. Only in the 1970s could a high school teacher assault a student by slapping her face in front of her peers and getting away with no repressions. Secretly, Chris plots revenge with her class mate Norma (P.J. Soles of 'Halloween') and boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta of 'The Devil's Rain') and Billy's buddy Freddy (Michael Talbot) to fix the prom vote so Carrie and Tommy will win. At the moment that Carrie receives her flower, Chris plans to tip a bucket of swine blood so that Carrie is drenched from head to toe in the gore.What nobody knocks is that with the onset of her period, Carrie has developed telekinetic powers. We see some foreshadowing of this awesome power early in the shower scene and later in the principal's office when Mr. Morton (Stefan Gierasch of 'High Plains Drifter') mispronounces Carrie's name as Cassie and the cigarette ashtray fragments. Later, at home with her warped mother, Carrie shatters a mirror with an etching of Jesus in the background. Tommy has to harass Carrie before she accepts his invitation to go to the prom with him. Predictably, Carrie's mother is dead set against her daughter donning a dress that will prominently display her 'dirty pillows' and plans some retribution of her own. Meanwhile, Miss Collins suspects initially that Sue and Tommy are up no good with Sue's decision to skip prom and her insistence that Tommy take Carrie. The night before all Hell breaks loose, Chris, Billy, and Freddy place the bucket of pig's blood directly over the stage. Freddy and Norma decide to fix the prom couple vote without anybody knowing any better.Naturally, things go smoothly for the evil villains, but they are in no way prepared for the electrifying outcome. After she is covered in the hog's blood, Carrie unleashes all her telekinetic powers and all but burns down the auditorium where the prom occurred. She walks out of these fireworks. When Chris and Billy try to run her down with his car, she turns her powers on them, their car rolls several times, ignites in a fireball explosion and incinerates them. Talk about a spectacular way to die! At home, Carrie washes off all the swine blood and seeks her mother's loving arms for comfortable only to scream when mom buries a knife in her back. Carrie has another telekinetic bout and skewers her mom with seven kitchen utensils. Suddenly, Carrie's small white house collapses around him, and the sole survivor of this nightmare is Sue. Sue goes to the flat, level site of Carrie's house to put flowers on the for sale sign and an arm from Hell soars up from the rocks to seize her, and she awakens to find her own mother consoling her after experiencing a nightmare. The ending will startle you because this is the last thing that you expect. Four years later, Sean S. Cunningham appropriated the shocker of a finale in his gruesome but seminal slasher 'Friday the 13th' with a small boy exploding from the calm surface of a lake to stab at a girl after the heroine had taken refuge in a boat to escape the villainess at Camp Crystal Lake. Director Brian De Palma never wears out his welcome with this 98-minute melodrama about a young girl and her supernatural powers and went on to exploit it in his next film 'The Fury.' 'The Fury,' however, was not the memorable experience that 'Carrie.'",10,3,5,3 November 2013
Blow," Everything Goes To Pot For Johnny Depp
","Crime doesn't pay in 'The Ref' director Ted Demme's 'Blow,' a Martin Scorsese-style, biographical crime expose about the real-life rise and demise of Boston-born drug trafficker George Jung. 'Donnie Brasco' star Johnny Depp portrays the amoral entrepreneur credited with stringing America out on cocaine as everyday, ordinary, and even honorable. In other words, 'Blow' is a far cry from Hollywood's stereotypical depiction of drug dealers as despicable dastards. Moreover, 'Blow' treats its convicted protagonist as a saintly casualty of the American Dream, shrewish women, and a self-destructive materialistic society. No matter how harshly the courts judged George Jung, currently serving a 60-year stretch in prison, 'Blow' depicts him as a nice guy who finished last in the wrong business. Double-crossing accomplices sell Jung out in this compelling but cautionary yarn. Veteran moviegoers will spot the allusions to Scorsese's 'Goodfellas,' John Glen's 'License to Kill,' Brian De Palma's 'Scarface,' and Franklin J. Schaffner's 'Papillon.' No sooner is Jung out of jail than he finds himself busted and back behind bars. Even the characters that sell him out think that he is a nice guy. Although crime doesn't pay (a status quo value), 'Blow' makes it look like the wrong guy got busted.Ultimately, nobody can gripe that Demme's compelling but depressing film celebrates illegal drug use and the criminal lifestyle. 'Blow' opens and closes with references to George Jung's status as a Federal prisoner. First, we hear him say he is incarcerated. Second, 'Blow' gives us a revealing glimpse of the real Jung before fade out. Scenarists Nick 'Alpha Dog' Cassavetes and David 'American History X' McKenna used Bruce Porter's 1993 Jung biography as the basis for their screenplay. In the first 10 minutes, they argue persuasively that a poverty-stricken environment and a castrating mother shaped George's ideology. George's hard-working, blue-collar dad, Fred Jung (Ray Liotta of 'Goodfellas') suffers several business setbacks. His status-seeking mom, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths of 'Murial's Wedding'), harps about how she married to rise above her lowly origins. Nevertheless, Fred's business debacles repeatedly land him in the poor house. Ermine leaves him only to return to his open, loving arms. George doesn't forgive her. After he watches his father declare bankruptcy, George vows never to be broke. He ignores his father's advice: 'Money isn't real. It doesn't matter. It only seems like it does.' George pulls up stakes with childhood pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee of 'Chasing Amy') and they head out for sunny California. George befriends Barbara (Franka Potente of 'Run, Lola, Run'), an airline stewardess, and her flamboyant, drug-peddling gay hairdresser Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens of 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse'). Instead of laboring at a nine-to-five job like his father, George lives on the beach and sells pot. Derek supplies the weed, and George sells it to bathers and bikers. Eventually, George starts flying in hundreds of pounds of reefer. Predictably, he gets busted when he grows too ambitious. When Barbara spring her terminal cancer revelation a la 'Love Story' & 'Terms of Endearment' on him, Jung jumps bail, skips the country, and lives with her in Mexico until she dies. When George sneaks back to visit mom and dad, Ermine calls the cops and George winds up in prison. Our counterculture cowboy shares a cell with Colombian car thief Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla of 'Dead for a Dollar'). While George is still on parole, Diego introduces him to powerful South American drug lord Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis of 'Fracture'), and George finds himself the point man for the Medellin Cartel in America. 'If you used cocaine in the 1970s or the early 1980s, there's an eighty-point per cent chance I imported it. We invented the marketplace.' George proclaims in Johnny Depp's deadpan voice-over narration.About an hour or so into 'Blow' things begin to slow. Demme turns George's rise as a marihuana dealer & smuggler into an anthology of idyllic scenes that culminate with Barbara and George buying a luxurious house in Acapulco. Suddenly, disaster strikes. 'Blow' becomes a series of Murphy's Law scenes. George's partners betray him. His hysterical Colombian wife snorts more coke than Michelle Pfeiffer did in 'Scarface.' George tries to quit smuggling, but the authorities raid his birthday party and find his wife's cocaine. Back to prison for George. When Johnny Depp walks into the shot, the camera frames his paunch. He has aged and later ages even more than Steve McQueen did in 'Papillon.' 'Blow's' principal characters live like gods, until they cannibalize themselves on their own greed. Unlike 'Traffic' with its ambitious, across-the-board tales about the futile war on drugs, 'Blow' confines itself to the dire consequences of cocaine on one man, his family, and his dreams. The last scenes are hopelessly saccharine. Undoubtedly, 'Life' & 'Beautiful Girls' director Ted Demme and his scribes have whitewashed George Jung to make him look more appealing and messianic. You cannot help but feel sorry for charismatic Johnny Depp he saunters through this above-average opus and gets screwed royally but one and all.",8,0,1,20 June 2008
1408," '1408' is one eerie creep show that delivers the shivers without sickening you with its skulduggery
","Watching the creepy John Cusack horror chiller '1408' reminded me of the spooky Jack Nicholson screamer 'The Shining,' except everything that occurred on a grand scale in an entire hotel in the Nicholson picture is confined to one single room occupancy in the Cusack epic. Not surprisingly, talented Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom of 'Derailed' and scenarists Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski took their haunted room opus '1408' from a short story by 'Shining' author Stephen King. '1408' concerns a notorious room at the Hotel Dauphin in New York City that nobody spends more than an hour in before they either commit suicide or die from natural causes. Compared with previous haunted house movies, this gripping, white-knuckled adaptation of a Stephen King yarn doesn't break any new ground. Nevertheless, Hafstrom illustrates that with good writing and agile directing 'less' can actually mean 'more.' Actor John Cusack, who has never starred in a throat-throttling tale of terror, is virtually the whole show and his persuasive performance rivals the first-rate computer generated special effects. Hardcore gorehounds may grimace at this PG-13 nail biter because you won't see private body parts hacked up and fed to German Shepherds as in 'Hostel: Part II.' Basically, '1408' qualifies as a stimulating, old-fashioned horror movie whose psychological plot invites favorable comparison with Rod Serling's venerable TV show 'The Twilight Zone'Mike Enslin (John Cusack of 'Identity') has acquired a 'ghost buster' reputation for the books he has written where he exposes haunted houses with supernatural apparitions as hoaxes. Mike doesn't believe in ghosts, but he is as game as he is curious. One day a postcard arrives about the Hotel Dauphin and its room 1408. He tries to register at the Dauphin to spend a night in the room, but the innkeepers refuse to accommodate our hero. Enslin's publisher Sam Farrell (Tony Shalhoub of TV's 'Monk') threatens the hotel with a civil rights lawsuit. Halfheartedly, hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Snakes on a Plane') allows Mike to check in, but not before he enlightens the author about 1408's tragic history. Earlier, Mike had discovered in his research that 4 people killed themselves in 1408, but Olin surprises him with more revelations. Fifty-six other guests died from natural causes after they stayed in 1408. One of Olin's maids gouged out her eyes out when he left her unattended in the room for a few minutes. Predictably, Mike dismisses Olin's admonitions as hokum. He points out that he has been at some of the worst nightmare palaces in the U.S. and proved that none were haunted. Mike's skepticism doesn't get him very far after he shuts the door to 1408 and settles in for the evening. Less than twenty minutes later strange things transpire. The AM-FM clock radio begins an hour-long countdown and the classic top-40 Carpenter's tune 'We've Only Just Begun' splits his eardrums. No matter how many times that Mike shuts off or unplugs the AM-FM clock radio, the possessed appliance recovers. Mike finally goes over the edge when a window inexplicably slams down on his hand and draws blood. Mike decides it's time to bail, but he's too late. When he tries to unlock the door from the inside with the key, the keyhole devours the key and the knob snaps off in Mike's fist when he yanks on it.'Derailed' director Mike Hafstrom relies on imagination rather than blood and gore to frighten the fiddlesticks out of you in ''1408.' Of course, he resorts to the time-honored horror movie tactics of having something leap out at you without warning, but he doesn't plow this tactic into the ground. Moreover, he refrains from harrowing depictions of ax-wielding felons on chopping sprees. There are several moments in '1408' when it appears as if nothing is occurring in the quaint hotel room. For example, Mike uses his laptop to instant message his ex-wife Lily (Mary McCormack of 'Mystery, Alaska,' who lives in Manhattan, to tell her about his predicament. However, after the N.Y.P.D. investigates, they inform Lily that they found nobody in room 1408. At another point, Mike tries desperately to escape from the room by climbing out onto the ledge, but what he sees outside scares him so badly that he returns to the room. Not long afterward, Mike has hallucinations that his young daughter Katie (newcomer Jasmine Jessica Anthony) who died from cancer has come back to console him. Is Mike going insane? Does evil really dwell in the hotel? '1408' emerges as one of the better horror movies about demonic hotels. Hafstrom's suspenseful 94-minute saga surpasses the half-baked Ashley Judd psycho drama 'Bug,' splashes less blood and gore than Eli Roth's 'Hostel: Part II,' and puts its hero through more mind-blowing ordeals than Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson faced in their own off-beat serial killers-in-a-hotel-room thriller 'Vacancy.' Altogether, '1408' is one eerie creep show that delivers the shivers without sickening you with its skulduggery.",8,1,2,27 June 2007
Taken 2," There Is Nothing Like Being 'Taken 2' The Limit and Beyond
","Writer and producer Luc Besson has said that the latest Liam Neeson abduction opus 'Taken 2' won't spawn a sequel. Nevertheless, the prolific Parisian filmmaker might whistle a different tune after he scrutinizes the box office that this handy, white-knuckled thriller has drummed up. Since it debuted Friday, October 5th, 'Taken 2' has taken twice as much as its exciting predecessor coined on its own opening day. Despite Besson's assurances to the contrary, co-scenarist Robert Mark Kamen and he have left 'Taken 2' wide open for another sequel. Meantime, little has changed since 2009 when director Pierre Morel's 'Taken' pitted retired CIA operative Bryan Mills against an Albanian-run white slavery ring operating out of Paris. This time around, Besson and Kamen have doubled the derring-do. Not only do the villains want to nab the daughter again, but they also want the father as well as his estranged wife. Director Olivier Megaton, who helmed 'Transporter 3' and 'Columbiana,' doesn't let anything stand in the way of Neeson as he shoots, stabs, and slugs his way through even more Albanians in this formulaic shoot'em up that never squanders a second of its pared down 91-minute running time. Although it isn't as suspenseful as the original 'Taken,' 'Taken 2' serves up more than enough outlandish action with some very obnoxious villains, including distinguished Croatian actor Rade Serbedzija, who take liberties with Neeson's co-star Famke Janssen. Chief among the assets of this sequel are its atmospheric Istanbul locations, particularly the Suleymaniye Mosque, the Grand Bazaar and the Bosphorus. Maggie Grace sprints across some impressive Turkish architecture with villains nipping at her heels while our hero plunges into some claustrophobic settings in search of his ex-wife.'Taken 2' opens as the coffins containing the corpses of the white slavers that Bryan Mills mowed down in 'Taken' are taken back to Albania for burial. During the funeral, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija of 'Batman Begins') vows to wreak vengeance on Mills for slaying his good-for-nothing son as well as the sons of his dastardly relatives. As it turns out, Bryan (Liam Nesson of 'The A-Team') has just completed a security job in Istanbul when his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen of 'GoldenEye') and his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace of 'Lockout') surprise him with their presence. Although Lenore and Bryan are divorced, this doesn't keep Kim from playing Cupid when she sends them off together for their own sight-seeing tour of Istanbul. The fiendish villains aren't far behind. They strike at the motel where Kim is splashing about in a swimming pool. Surprisingly, they fail to nab Kim because her fleet-footed, fast-thinking father is a couple of steps ahead of them. Bryan alerts his daughter and tries to pack Lenore out of harm's way, too. Of course, complications arise. Murad's well-armed minions capture both Bryan and Lenore and hide them in the bazaar. Since he knows a thing or two about handling hard cases, Bryan isn't on ice long before he retaliates and takes down one Albanian after another with extreme prejudice. Predictably, Bryan saves the day, but not before the villains slash Lenore and suspend her upside down so that gravity is about to drain her of life, love, and the pursuit of happiness in a mere 30 minutes. None of this will do, and Bryan figures a way out of his predicament, but he cannot rescue his ex-wife as quickly as he would prefer. The villains haul Lenore off again, and our hero has to second guess them using what he saw and heard during their initial abduction to track them down.Mind you, most of the repugnant villains behave like ten-pins in a bowling alley that our hero knocks down with absurd ease. What sets 'Taken 2' apart from the conventional kidnap caper is Bryan's method of locating himself and his wife. After she escapes from her would-be abductors, Kim scrambles across rooftops slinging grenades so her father can triangulate his location for her and bring her to his rescue. She delivers an automatic pistol to him, and he starts slinging lead with no end in sight. When director Olivier Megaton isn't showing things from the perspective of the father, he stages several snap, crackle, pop action scenes that will make you squirm and wince. Make no mistake, 'Taken 2' could have been twice as bloody as an R-rated thriller, but PG-13 nail-biters pull in bigger audiences. 'Taken 2' will have you begging for a third!",8,3,7,6 October 2012
Step Up," Predictable but Entertaining, Opposites Attract, Teen Dance movie
","'27 Dresses' director Anne Fletcher's urban dance musical 'Step Up' qualifies as a predictable but entertaining teen movie about the society's haves and have-not's and the peculiar circumstances that bring them together. Essentially, 'Step Up' resembles 'Save the Last Dance for Me' but with the roles reversed and the setting modified. Jenna Dewan of 'Take the Lead' plays the heroineNora Clarkwho lives to dance and can imagine nothing else but dancing in her life. Her mom worries about her daughter and her future and pushes her to think about college rather than getting a job as a professional dancer. Nora is the best ballerina at the Maryland School of the Arts, and she cherishes the memory of her late father who supported her dancing aspirations with unconditional love. Vanilla Ice look-alike Channing Tatum of 'Havoc' plays the hero--Tyler Gagea 'Rocky' type character. When underachiever Tyler isn't displaying his superlative street dancing moves, he hangs out with two African-American friendsMac Carter (Damaine Radcliff of 'Glory Road') and Mac's impetuous little brother Skinny (newcomer De'Shawn Washington)and they steal cars for local chop-shop gangster Omar (Hip-Hop Musician Heavy D of 'Dallas 362') who loves to throw parties.Tyler and Nora hail from completely different backgrounds. She lives in the lap of luxury with her single mom, and Tyler lives with a foster family. She attends high school at the Maryland School of the Arts, and he bides time at a local high school. One night after they provide Omar with another hot vehicle, Tyler, Mac, and Skinny are playing around throwing bottles at each other when one of the bottles smashes a window in the MSA building. Inquisitive as they are, this happy-go-luck trio enters the edifice through the broken window and trash an auditorium. In the middle of their vandalism, a security guard appears and manages to tackle Tyler while Mac and Skinny beat it for parts unknown. The judge sentences Tyler to 200 hours of community service that our hero must serve at MSA and MSA director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths of 'Ned Kelly') tells him that his vandalism has cost the school one scholarship for a student. Tyler winds up performing custodial duties everyday after he gets out of school. One day he spots pretty Nora in her dance class and she reciprocates his look of interest with one of her own. Currently, Nora is hard at work on a dance routine with the help of her boyfriend Brett Dolan (Josh Henderson of 'Broken Bridges') who is providing the music. Her dance number will appear in the showcase at the end of the semester that prospective dance employers will watch, so a lot is riding on her search for music and choreography. Things turn sour for Nora when her dance partnerColin (newcomer Jamie Scott)injures his leg. Nora cannot find anybody who can dance with her and hold her up above their head as a part of the dance routine. One day Nora spots Tyler demonstrating some of his gyrating hip movements. Reluctantly, she asks Gordon if she can use Tyler and Gordon gives them her approval. Nora confides in Tyler that she has a great idea for a dance routine but it requires more dancers. When they practice next, Tyler shows up with a dozen dancers from MSA. Apparently, Nora doesn't know her way around MSA all that well and she lacks Tyler's charisma.At this point, 'Step Up' degenerates into the typical boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, but boy-wins-girl back. Tyler starts off as a jerk but over the course of the movie his behavior ameliorates. Naturally, Mac and Skinny don't have a clue about what Tyler has gotten himself into, but what they do know is that he has been shunning them to perform his community service and rehearse with Nora. Along the way, more trouble occurs when Skinny is shot by a gangsta for stealing the gunman's vehicle. The usual funeral occurs and Tyler realizes now where his priorities lay. They go on stage and perform the dance routine with Nora's mom in the audience and Mac watching his boy do his thing. Predictably, Nora's prayers are answered and she realizes her dreams. When the dance employers ask about Tyler, director Gordon chimes in that he is a transfer student. The dancing is good enough and the characters of Tyler and Nora as star-crossed lovers is easy to handle. The opposites that attract each other has been done a million times, but the convention still packs a punch and the two have chemistry. The things that drag down 'Step Up' are the ghetto, inner city stuff with Skinny getting a cap popped in him off-screen. Basically, scenarists Duane Adler of 'Save the Last Dance for Me' and 'Dexter' scribe Melissa Rosenberg preserve all of the dance and romantic love stories clichés and Fletcher shuffles it all together for a feel-good 103 minute melodrama. Everything, by the way, takes place in Baltimore and the filmmakers shot every frame on location in Baltimore. Despite the familiarity of the material, Fletcher brings a raw energy and enough momentum to make it entertaining enough.",7,0,0,17 February 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Excellent Serial Killer Thriller
","'Something Wild' director Jonathan Demme's 'The Silence of the Lambs' proved to be a memorable milestone of a movie in both the careers of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. This serial killer thriller concerns the efforts of an FBI agent in training who proves instrumental in cracking a case that nobody could have solved without her help. The daughter of a small-time cop, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster of 'Taxi Driver') is minding her own business at Quantico, Virginia, negotiating an obstacle course when the FBI Chief of Behavioral Sciences, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn of 'Sucker Punch') summons her for an interview. Crawford wants Clarice to visit convicted murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector where he has been imprisoned for eight years. In fact, Lector hasn't laid eyes on a woman for eight years. The warden in charge of Lector's incarnation is a conceited egotist, Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald of 'Red Dragon'), who makes a pass at her and fails. Before he allows Clarice to speak with Hannibal, Chilton shows her a photo of what happened to a nurse that Lector gnawed on. The nurse is permanently disfigured as a result of Lector's attack. Lector is now kept in a cell with a reinforced glass window and stone walls. Dr. Chilton is prepared to escort Clarice into Lector's presence, but she convinces him that Lector may clam up at the sight of Chilton. Rudely, Chilton dismisses himself and turns Clarice over to Barney. Barney (Frankie Faison of 'Hannibal') provides Clarice with a chair and she and Lector talk briefly. Lector isn't the only unsavory soul in the prison. In what amounts to an infamous death row of sorts, other perverts are housed in the same area. One of them, Miggs, make a derogatory comment to Clarice about her body odor, and Lector later kills Miggs. Meantime, Clarice entices Lector to talk about Buffalo Bill. Bill is a serial killer who has slain five women. These women are a little bigger than the average. In Memphis, we watch as the killer, Jame Gumb (Ted Levine of 'Heat') abducts a girl when he is struggling to load a sofa into his van. Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) backs into the rear of the van and Gumb traps her and takes her to his house. In the basement of his residence, Gumb has a pit where he holds Catherine. Meantime, Lector provides Catherine's mother with information and he is moved to another facility. During his sojourn at the new facility, Lector fakes off the guards, kills them, and manages to escape. Lector's escape is pretty incredible. By this time, Clarice believes that she has found a clue. Crawford warns her that they have found the killer. Clarice continues with her part of the investigation and stumbles onto Gumb living in the residence where she thought she would find somebody else. Clarice narrowly survives a suspenseful moment when Gumb extinguishes the lights and uses night-vision goggles to overpower her. Clarice cannot see but she can hear and she shoots at the sound of a revolver being cocked. She empties her gun into Gumb and he dies. In other words, he doesn't jump up a few moments later. 'Silence of the Lambs' concludes with Clarice graduating from the FBI Academy. Well-made, well-acted, 'Silence' is top-notch material.",10,4,9,25 July 2013
X-Men: First Class," 'X-Men' is Extraordinary!
","'X-Men: First Class' is an first class 'X-Men' movie.'Kiss Ass' director Matthew Vaughn and scenarists Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Jane Goldman have done a marvelous job depicting the back story to the first 'X-Men' movie. Furthermore, they have done something ingenious by using Cuban Missile Crisis as part of the story. As Sebastian Shaow, Kevin Bacon makes a superb villain who rarely delivers a threat he doesn't carry out. In his first scene with a young Erik, he threatens to shoot Erik's mom at the Nazi concentration camp if Erik doesn't move a coin on his desk. When Erik cannot summon sufficient power to move the coin a millimeter, Sebastian Shaw shoots her stone cold dead without a qualm. Shaw's cold-blooded murder of Erik's mom triggers a rage in him, and he crunches a small metal ringer bell, some filing cabinets, and then the helmets of the two German soldiers holding his mom. Later, when a high American ranking officer threatens to commit suicide and take Shaw with him, Shaw snatches the hand grenade away from Colonel Hendry and pulls the pin. We watch as he absorbs the explosion before Hendry's eyes. Bacon's villainy knows no bounds. Later, James McAvoy appears as Charles Xavier before he receives his title as a university professor, and Michael Fassbender is the adult form of Erik Lensherr. Erik is in hot pursuit of Shaw. He travels to Argentina to track down Shaw, but he finds only two of his associates in a bar. One says he is a pig farmer and the other is a tailor. Erik disposes of both of them in a slick showdown, stabbing the pig farmer in the hand twice. In one terrific scene, when he finds Shaw aboard his yacht, he uses the anchor of Shaw's yacht to destroy the yacht. The first scene in the Nazi camp bears an amazing resemblance to the scene in director Bryan Singer's original 'X-Men.' After that creepy scene, director Mathew Vaughn stages the eventful scene in his office with Erik when he guns down his mother. As he leaves Erik alone, he presses the coin into his palm that he had asked Erik to move. Vaughn and his writers show us Charles Xavier at an early age when he encounter Raven for the first time. She is in his kitchen after dark attempting to steal food when he walks in on her with a baseball bat. He exposes her for a fraud because she is masquerading as his late mother. The confrontation concludes with blows as Charles and Raven become life-long friends. Eventually, the C.I.A. recognizes the presence of mutants when Xavier reads their minds and Raven performs her shape-shifting tricks before their eyes. Meantime, Erik has grown up, and he is searching for Shaw. This time he doesn't have as much luck with his adversaries as he had earlier with a Swiss banker and two Nazis hiding out in Argentina. Shaw and his two mutant friends evict him from their yacht. At the same time, CIA Agent Moria MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) has been on the trail of Shaw. Since she cannot convince her superiors that mutants exist, she invites a recently graduated Xavier to CIA Headquarters with Raven alongside to advise them about the reality of mutants. Naturally, Moria's CIA superiors aren't impressed. Nevertheless, Moria and Charles pursue Shaw.The showdown during the Cuban Missile Crisis is skillfully orchestrated and watching Magneto levitate a submarine out of the Gulf of Mexico is impressive.Hugh Jackman's profane cameo as Wolverine makes the movie and seals its continuity with the other 'X-Men' epics.",9,6,11,20 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," More Tease Than Sleaze
","Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E.L. James' erotic bestseller 'Fifty Shades of Grey' qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. 'Nowhere Boy' director Sam Taylor-Johnston and 'Saving Mr. Banks' scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James' novel and turned it into an antiseptic, 'Cinderella' fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' isn't as abysmal as the amateurish 'Addicted.' Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because 'Fifty Shades' is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both 'Shame' (2011) and 'The Lover' (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqué occurs until the concluding scene. You won't see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie 'Body of Evidence' (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in 'Fatal Attraction,' or the infamous 'Last Tango in Paris' where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James' two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn't hoist anybody's eyebrows.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnston of 'The Five Year Engagement') is a shy, virginal, doe-eyed brunette who majors in English Lit at Washington State University and works at a hardware store. She shares an apartment with her best friend, blond-haired Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford of 'In the Blood'), who serves as the campus newspaper editor. As the action unfolds, woebegone, pajama-clad Kate is wrestling with a cold. Kate persuades Anastasia to pinch hit for her on a newspaper assignment. She sends her out to interview bachelor billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan of 'Marie Antoinette') who rules a colossal corporate empire. Basically, Christian is the Bruce Wayne of hanky-spanky. An orphan who survived the death of his crack-addict mom, Christian has amassed a fortune, but he harbors a deep, dark secret. When she enters 'The House of Grey,' Anastasia knows little about him. Anxious about her assignment, Anastasia makes a klutz of herself when she enters Grey's office. No sooner has she crossed the threshold than she stumbles and crumples to her hands and knees. Realizing she hasn't made the best impression, Anastasia recovers her confidence and begins the interview. Initially, Christian adopts an icy attitude toward her, but he thaws out once they start talking. Christian finds the way Anastasia chews her lip so irresistible that he cancels his next appointment. Some of Kate's questions shock Anastasia, particularly when she quizzes the tycoon about his sexual orientation. A life-long bachelor who has never been photographed in public with a woman, Christian explains that he has little use for conventional romances with hearts and flowers. A relieved Anastasia leaves Christian behind in his phallic monolith of a building and cruises home. As it turns out, Anastasia is just as captivated with Christian as the latter is with her. Later, they go on a date, and eventually he deflowers her. He wants Anastasia to join him in a sexual liaison as a 'submissive' to his 'dominant.' Christian and she negotiate terms of a contract. For example, the open-minded Anastasia has no problems with being tied up and titillated with a peacock feather, but she draws the line at vaginal fisting and genital clamps. Meantime, Christian does everything he can to corrupt Anastasia, buying her a Mac notebook and replacing her classic Volkswagen Beetle with a shiny red Audi. Ultimately, Christian convinces our heroine to let him show her how bondage can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, Anastasia isn't as gullible as she seems. At fade-out, she gains the upper hand in their bizarre relationship.The casting in 'Fifty Shades of Grey' creates half of the problem. Dakota Johnson makes an ideal Anastasia. She gives a believable performance as a naïve college student who has just graduated and treasures the kind classic 19th century British fiction that Thomas Hardy wrote. The Austin, Texas, born actress seems wholly comfortable with her casual nudity, and it is interesting to note that 'Miami Vice's' Don Johnson is her dad and Melanie Griffith of 'Something Wild' is her mom. She isn't as goofy as her literary counterpart. Sadly, lean, handsome Jamie Dornan doesn't cut the mustard. He doesn't behave like a ruthless cutthroat who owns a billion dollar corporation, and his performance is considerably less spontaneous. Although he wears his apparel well and delivers his dialogue with crisp precision, Dornan looks more like a callow amateur. In all fairness to Dornan, he impersonates a character that doesn't seem remotely believable, and his lack of personality underlines his lightweight performance. The other big problem is the film seems as impersonal as a bargain basement torture rack. Basically, Johnston and Marcel have designed it as a bondage primer that cautiously advances from one elaborate interlude to another without drumming up any melodrama. Primarily, the filmmakers rely more on winks rather than winces as our heroine navigates the dire straits of Christian's sexual calisthenics. Keep in mind, Anastasia doesn't say no until she knows better. Gradually, Christian peels back the layers of his paranoia, revealing himself as an onion that initiates our heroine's tears and fears. When director Sam Johnston shifts the focus from the game of sexual chess between Anastasia and Christian, the film sacrifices suspense. Undeniably, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' will keep your eyes wide open, but it dwells more on tease instead of sleaze.",5,37,51,9 March 2015
The Wolverine," Wolverine De-Clawed
","Let me say up front without apology that 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' qualified as a fantastic piece of formulaic fodder. Before I saw director James Mangold's 'The Wolverine,' I watched 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' again and wondered how anybody could top such a tour-de-force tale. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' boasted everything that a blockbuster movie requires: charismatic heroes, wicked villains both human and mutant, larger-than-life spectacle, tearful romance, treacherous betrayal, and histrionic revenge. During its first weekend, this Marvel mutant masterpiece coined over $85 million. Ultimately, it grossed $373 million globally. Comparatively, 'The Wolverine' raked in only $55 million during its first weekend. Analysts had predicted $70 million. Not surprisingly, 'The Wolverine' isn't half as entertaining as 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine.' Although James Mangold is a gifted director, 'The Wolverine' ranks well below his other epics. He directed the brilliant Johnny Cash & June Carter biopic 'I Walk the Line,' the complex Sylvester Stallone crime drama 'Copland,' the gritty western remake '3:10 to Yuma' with Russell Crowe & Christian Bale, the aggressive Tom Cruise actioneer 'Knight and Day,' and the critically acclaimed chick flick 'Girl, Interrupted.' Mangold isn't a high-profile, Oscar winning, celebrity director whose name sells tickets like Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, and James Cameron. Capable and competent, Mangold has proved to be only as good as his material. This above-average but uneven Twentieth Century Fox release suffers from undistinguished villains who make little impression and a synthetic storyline that stalls out several times during its indulgent 129-minute running time. Mangold excels when depicting the Wolverine's woes. Unfortunately, scenarists Mark Bomback of 'Unstoppable' and Scott Frank of 'Minority Report' have concocted a pedestrian yarn that doesn't broaden our knowledge of the protagonist. Despite its polished production values, the anti-climatic 'The Wolverine' comes up short as a seminal superhero saga.Ostensibly, Bomback and Frank adapted Marvel's limited run series 'Wolverine' written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Frank Miller back in 1982. Apparently, neither Bomback nor Frank fretted about fidelity to the source material. They've changed several things, including Logan's decision to visit Japan. As it turns out, 'The Wolverine' is a sequel to 'X-Men: The Last Stand,' not 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine.' The opening thirty minutes differ from the limited series comic book. First, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen of 'GoldenEye') keeps invading Logan's dreams. (If you're hoping Jean Grey will play an integral role in 'The Wolverine,' prepare to be sorely disappointed. She appears just as suddenly as she vanishes and then keeps on annoying Logan one time too often. While the 'Wolverine' limited run series mentioned Jean Grey, Scott 'Cyclops' Summers worried more about her than Logan. Second, Wolverine is camping in the woods and grieving over Jean's death when he encounters a huge bear. Later, a hunter shoots this bear with a poisonous arrow but doesn't kill it. In the comic, Wolverine plunges into the bear's den to kill it after it has slain several people. In 'The Wolverine,' he finds the poor bear and puts it out of its misery before heading off to confront the hunter. Third, unlike Bomback and Frank, Claremont and Miller didn't knit World War II, Nagasaki, and Wolverine's saving an enemy officer into their narrative.'The Wolverine' unfolds on the historic day when America dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945. The Japanese military maintain a prison camp across the bay from the city. The Wolverine, Logan (Hugh Jackman with his signature mutton-chops), is sweating it out in solitary confinement when the atomic bomb falls. (In 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine,' you saw Wolverine participate in the American Civil War, World War I, World War II in Europe, and The Vietnam War. Evidently, our hero must have volunteered for action in the Pacific as he helped vanquish the Nazis in Europe.) Anyhow, Logan saves Japanese prison camp officer, Yashida (Ken Yamamura), after his three superiors have committed ritual suicide. Miraculously, Yashida and Wolverine both survive the horrific blast. The Wolverine looks like a scorched pepperoni pizza after exposure to the blast. Our hero's regenerative powers, however, enable him to heal himself completely without a scratch. Yashida escaped certain death through the Wolverine's intervention. The prison camp officer emerges with a scar on his face as a testament to his presence at the blast.In the film, years after Nagasaki, an elderly Yashida struggles against all hope on his death bed. He has a brilliant doctor named Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkov) who is keeping him alive. Yashida is the mastermind behind an internationally profitable electronics empire. He dispatches his daughter's friend to find the Wolverine. The agile, sword-wielding wrath, Yukio (Rila Fukushima), tracks the Wolverine down to a tavern of Canada as he is about to kill the bear hunter. Meantime, the comic followed a different path. After he settled up with the hunter in the bar, Wolverine winged his way off to Japan because his girlfriend Mariko had stopped talking to him. When he arrived in the Land of the Rising Sun, Wolverine discovered that Mariko wanted nothing to do with him. Mariko's gangster father Lord Shingen has come back into her life. Moreover, Shingen has forced her to marry another man so her father can dominate the Japanese Underworld. At this point, Wolverine found himself up to his ears in Yakuza. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Logan for the sixth time. He delivers an absorbing performance as the tortured but sympathetic X-Man. Literally, the Wolverine is the only well-rounded character in this half-baked actioneer. Meantime, the villainous Yashida emerges as a lackluster adversary who only wants to prolong his life at Logan's expense. In the long run, the beautiful but bland Viper proves to be more deceptive than destructive. In the limited run series, all the X-Men showed up for our hero's triumphant return. Mangold and his scribes make their worse mistake when they pit Logan against an army of villains that cannot hold their own in combat with our hero and his razor-sharp, adamantium claws.",7,1,4,2 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Best 'Batman' Movie Ever!!!
","I cannot imagine a 'Batman' movie after 'The Dark Knight Rises' (**** out of ****) without 'Inception' director Christopher Nolan at the helm. Warner Brothers and DC Comics got this legendary costume-clad crime fighter trilogy 'right.' Sure, you can nitpick, but Nolan's 'Batman' movies differed in ambiance from those of both Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. Nolan's 'Batman' movies trod a thin line turning a vigilante into a hero and scrutinizing the morality of his behavior. Essentially, Nolan rebooted the franchise, recreated Bruce Wayne and Batman as troubled alter-egos, and turned the good versus evil episodes of the earlier films into full-blown spectacles. While sticking slavishly to the basics, he relied on his fertile imagination to give the characters greater depth and examine the issue of vigilantism. Nolan's Caped Crusader movies don't rely on humor as much as slight, off-hand comments. The action unfolds swiftly, and the characters are clearly delineated before the end credits roll. You prepare yourself for the surprises. The films replicate the haunted quality that Burton forged with his Michael Keaton forays, while Schumacher embraced a bright, heavily saturated, slightly surreal comic book quality. Of course, the 'Batman' graphic novels of Frank Miller have influenced Nolan. Christian Bale's part in the success of the trilogy is considerable. He is more of a Michael Keaton 'Batman' than either a Val Kilmer or a George Clooney crime fighter. Bale is to Batman the same way that Sean Connery was to Bond. Long-time British actor Michael Caine makes a superb Alfred Pennyworth, but Michael Gough was no slouch himself in the four previous 'Batman' incarnations. Unquestionably, Nolan steps back from Batman at the Caped Crime Buster's zenith. The ending to this trilogy capper is odd. Indeed, Warner Brothers conceivably could make another 'Batman' movie based on Nolan's conclusion to 'The Dark Knight Rises.'Anybody who tries to top 'The Dark Knight Rises' will have a lot to prove both artistically and financially. Christopher Nolan is to the 'Batman' movies what James Cameron was to the 'Terminator' movies. Stepping into Nolan's shoes will pose a supreme challenge for whoever dares. Nolan approached the 'Batman' franchise with reverence, played the plots as close to straight as possible, and shunned clever one-liners. 'The Dark Knight Rises' surpasses both the 'Batman Begins' origin movie and 'The Dark Knight.' 'The Dark Knight Rises' takes the franchise to the brink of annihilation with what amounts to a Gotham City Armageddon. Batman contends with two worthy opponents that played a part in his origins. The most obvious villain is Bane. A hulking brute of a man, he looks like a cross between of a wrestler and equivalent of a human pit bulldog. Bane wears a contraption over his face that enables him to handle the pain of life. Basically, we never see British actor Tom Hardy's face because he conceals it with a mask. Interestingly, this imbues Bane with a mystery. Furthermore, Bane speaks through this contraption and he sounds quite avuncular. In other words, he doesn't sound as menacing as Darth Vader, but he doesn't mince words. Finally, former Disney princess Anne Hathaway makes a willowy Cat Woman. Just as the Marvel people had trouble getting Hulk right, the DC people have experienced similar trouble getting Catwoman right. Anne Hathaway makes the perfect Catwoman.The sheer spectacle of 'The Dark Knight Rises' dwarfs 'The Dark Knight.' Eight years has elapsed since the murder of Harvey Dent and the disappearance of the Caped Crusader. Guests at Wayne Manor make remarks about the tragic figure skulking about on the balcony in the distance. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale of 'Terminator Salvation') has turned into a contemporary Howard Hughes. He is amazed when he catches a burglar in his side of the mansion. Moreover, she is a delectable burglar. She has cracked Wayne's safe and stolen his mother's pearls. Since Gotham City is largely safe now, the authorities are not prepared when a gang assaults Wall Street and tries to plunge the economy in chaos. Batman makes a triumphant return in top form with a new gadget that resembles a mini-helicopter. Initially, Batman has no trouble licking his adversaries. Against the Catwoman, he seems vulnerable. She likes to let him down. When he confronts Bane, Batman's gauntleted fists exert no more effect on him than they would on a bag of cement. Indeed, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman of 'The Fifth Element') is back on the case. He knows the truth about Harvey Dent, even if he doesn't know the identity of the Batman. If you missed either or both 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight,' you may find yourself in an expositional purgatory. Nolan's 'Batman' trilogy fits snugly together, aside from the change of casting between 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' when Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes in the District Attorney's Office. 'The Dark Knight Rises' packs the Caped Crusader into exile. Bane batters him into submission. Nolan takes not only Gotham City to the limit, but also he takes audiences to the limit with an actioneer that clocks in at 164 minutes. Nevertheless, 'The Dark Knight Rises' qualifies as the best 'Batman' movie ever!",10,37,51,30 July 2012
Black Panther," Just Another Man in a Hero's Suit Who Happens to be Black
","A groundbreaking magnum opus of cinematic marketing for African-Americans, 'Creed' director Ryan Coogler's 'Black Panther' (** OUT OF ****) has demonstrated the impact that a film can create when a single demographic embraces it. The 18th Marvel Studios superhero saga has coined over a billion dollars. Apart from the R-rated Marvel Comics 'Blade' trilogy, African-Americans have waited patiently for a suitable larger-than-life champion with a PG-13 rating. A largely derivative but a polished escapade from start to finish, 'Black Panther' amounts to a standard-issue, Panther malice-in-the-palace melodrama. The generational gap in the skewered relationship between father and son in director Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole's screenplay provides this epic with its most thematically compelling material. The son spends most of his time handling the mistakes that his short-sighted father has made. The secret fantasy kingdom of Wakanda shares some similarities with the clandestine island in 'Wonder Woman.' Basically, 'Black' constitutes an origins story about a hero in a cat-suit with ears and his homeland. Mind you, this isn't the first time Black Panther has graced the silver screen. He made his debut in the contrived and drawn-out 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) where the Avengers broke ranks and swore loyalty to either Captain America or Iron Man. Chadwick Boseman exhibits the steadfast confidence and physical agility to play Marvel Comic's first African-born superhero. Unfortunately, since he is not only a king, but also a politician who symbolizes the status quo, he seems hopelessly bland and straightforward. Boseman needs to jettison the pseudo-African accent that he uses as Prince T'Challa because it sounds synthetic. Comparably, Michael B. Jordan emerges as far more appealing than a ruthless adversary should. As an illegitimate ghetto offspring of Wakandan blood, the charismatic Jordan spouts the minimal number of profanities allowed for a PG-13 rating. Similarly, the dynamic women who surround Black Panther as his elite bodyguard are far more exciting than the ruler they shield from danger. For the record, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created 'Black Panther' in 1966 when the character debuted in issue # 52 of first volume of the 'The Fantastic Four.' The film 'Black Panther' opens as a narrator explains that long before mankind arose, an enormous meteorite crashed into the jungles of Africa. The five tribes of Wakanda would eventually gravitate around the crash site. Described as 'the strongest metal in the universe,' the vibranium in this meteorite drastically altered the composition of local plant life. The Five Tribes of Wakanda fought without closure until the Panther goddess Bast appeared in a vision to a shaman warrior. Four of the tribes lived together, while the fifth took up residence in the mountains. This warrior found a 'Heart-Shaped Herb' that endowed him with superhuman strength as well as speed. He emerged as the first Black Panther. Meantime, the Wakandans excavated vibranium and forged technology as well as weapons far beyond anything else on Earth. Paranoid that the world would plunder their secrets, Wakanda guarded it jealously and withheld it to keep foreigners from exploiting it. Earlier in 'Captain America: Civil War,' the Wakanda King T'Challa died in an explosion at the United Nations in Vienna, and his son set out to find the killer. If you've seen 'Civil War,' you know the killer was none other than James 'Bucky' Barnes, aka 'The Winter Soldier.' Barnes reprises his role in an end credits cameo for anybody with the patience to stick around and watch it.Sadly, despite their best efforts to conceal the vibranium, the Wakandans fail. A colorful but cruel arms merchant, racist Afrikaner Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis of 'Avengers: The Age of Ultron'), and a renegade mercenary Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan of 'Fantastic Four') shoot up a British museum and steal an ancient Wakandan ax containing vibranium. Our hero T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman of 'Get on Up') pursues Klaue, but 'Killmonger' beats our hero to the villainous Afrikaner. Meantime, T'Challa satisfies all the rituals before his coronation. He must submit to any challengers who want to fight him for his monarchy. Of course, nobody confronts him since they respect him. As their new King, T'Challa learns about the dreadfully unfair demise of his father's brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown of 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot') and his ghetto-born son. 'Killmonger' challenges T'Challa, and they slug it out in a pool located atop a perilous waterfall. T'Challa appears to finally have met his match, but 'Killmonger' lets him escape. Plunging into a deep gorge where a torrential river flows, T'Challa vanishes from sight. The authorities proclaim 'Killmonger' the new Wakandan king. His first imperial act is to share vibranium with other Third World black countries. Of course, you know 'Killmonger' cannot get away with this perfidy. Predictably, T'Challa may be down, but it isn't entirely out of the picture.Our hero need not worry about hasty last-minute costume changes. He wears a necklace that deploys his black, one-piece outfit and activates all its myriad capabilities. For example, if you strike him, the suit channels the energy in reverse, and the assailant suffers blowback. The Wakandans boast an incredible arsenal of futuristic weapons. James Bond would envy some of these Wakandan gadgets. At one point, they save an American CIA agent, Everett K. Rose (Martin Freeman of 'Hot Fuzz'), from a devastating spinal wound that would have confined him for life in a wheelchair. English actor Freeman seems woefully miscast as an American. Coogler stages some modest action scenes. Nevertheless, everything about this formulaic adventure remains so by-the-numbers that you can guess the outcome. One of the more interesting characters, Andy Serkis' Klaue, is probably the liveliest, but he gets his comeuppance about half-way through the heroics. You won't be able to take your eyes off Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira. Altogether, 'Black Panther' ushers long-overdue diversity into the Marvel Comics Universe, but this promising superhero pales by comparison with Wesley Snipes 'Blade' for sheer bravado and derring-do.",5,3,4,1 April 2018
Iron Man," 'Iron Man' Is Great Fun!
","The new Marvel Comics, science-fiction, super-hero saga 'Iron Man' (***1/2 out of ****) qualifies as a lightweight load of larger-than-life nonsense that consistently delivers thrills, chills, and surprises throughout its entertaining two hours and six minutes. Indeed, 'Iron Man' rivals 'Spider-Man' as one of the best superhero movies. For the record, Marvel Comics honcho Stan Lee and his team conjured up 'Iron Man' back in 1963. What differentiates Tony Stark from other superheroes is that he forged his own super powers. Think of Tony as a modern-day equivalent of Vulcan, the mythical blacksmith to the gods, because our hero can wield a forge to fashion weapons.Basically, 'Zathura' director Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man' amounts to an origins epic. Like 'Blade' (1998), 'Spider-Man' (2002), 'The Punisher' (2005) and 'Fantastic Four' (2005), all modeled on the vintage 1978 super-hero origins opus 'Superman: The Movie,' 'Iron Man' introduces its quirky super-hero character and shows us how he acquired his name and reputation. People that have never read an 'Iron Man' comic book need not worry. Favreau and his quartet of clever scribes, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby of 'Children of Men,' Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, provide all the essential information that you need to know about our 'Iron Man.' The most remarkable thing about 'Iron Man' is that it is a summer superhero actioneer with a grown-up hero that is significantly older than the typical superhero.News reporter Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb of 'The Skulls') reviles roguish billionaire armaments manufacturer Tony Stark (a charismatic Robert Downy Jr., in a Van Dyke beard) as a merchant of death who shows little remorse about the death and violence that he reaps with his state-of-the-art technology. Instead, Tony wallows in booze and broads. In his corporate jet, for example, his sexy flight attendants double as pole swinging strippers. It seems that, like oil magnate Howard Hughes, Tony inherited his weapons plant from his late father, and he has carried on in the finest family tradition with new and more devastating armaments. Tony qualifies as a naïve patriot. The armaments that he invents are designed in his mind to keep America safe and strong. Tony flies to battleground Afghanistan to demonstrate his latest top-of-the-line guided missile--the Jerichoto the military. Afterward, swarthy Taliban-like terrorists wipe out the Army convoy with which Tony is riding and nearly kill the arms tycoon with one of his own weapons. When our hero recovers from his close shave with death, he learns that a kindly doctor Yinson (Shaun Toub of 'Paradise Now') has inserted a magnetic device in his chest to keep the shrapnel from the missile from killing him. The villainous insurgents hold Tony hostage in a cave, and their leader, the evil Raza (Faran Tahir of 'Charlie Wilson's War'), orders our hero to build them Jericho rockets. Of course, Tony refuses to accommodate him. Instead, he shapes a suit of crude armor that enables him to spew napalm from his wrists and fly. Originally, in the 1963 comic book, this 'Iron Man' exploit occurred in Vietnam when our chief adversaries were the Commies.After his miraculous escape, a morally reconstituted Tony announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. Stark's older, wiser business partner Obadiah Stone (Jeff Bridges of 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot') steps in and tries to downplay Tony's sudden pacifism. Meanwhile, the wicked insurgents dig up the remains of Tony's prototypical suit of armor that he used to escape from them in the desert and try to reassemble it. Similarly, Tony sequesters himself like Dr. Jekyll in his own research laboratory and starts from scratch on the suit. Occasionally, he relies on his loyal girl Friday, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow of 'Great Expectations'), to run errands and tie up his loose ends. Tony's closest friend, U.S. A. F. Colonel Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard of 'Hustle & Flow'), serves as his liaison with the Pentagon. At one point, Rhodes drums up a cover story to prevent his own bosses from knowing that Tony was responsible for the crash of an F-22 supersonic jet fighter during a mid-air collision between the jet and Tony in his new souped-up Iron Man outfit.The foursome that wrote 'Iron Man' provide our hero with a challenging villain in the person of Jeff Bridges. The laid-back Bridges looks particularly sinister because he wears an Abe Lincoln beard but keeps his noggin freshly shaven. Bridges never tries to appear intimidating and seems all the more intimidating. Favreau and his writers are politically correct to never identify the Afghan antagonists either by religion or ideology. Oscar nominated leading man Robert Downey Jr of 'Chaplin' makes a terrific career comeback with 'Iron Man.' Downey languished throughout the late 1990s in a number of lackluster roles after his highly-publicized bouts with drug dependency. He brings an energy and sense of humor to his super hero conspicuously absent from his competitors. 'Iron Man' has already recouped its $140 million budget and the franchise is off and flying high with a sequel projected for 2009. Moreover, Downey's Tony Stark character is scheduled to appear briefly in the new 'Incredible Hulk' movie with Edward Norton later this summer. Altogether, 'Iron Man' is a far cry from 'RoboCop' meets 'The Iron Giant.' Despite its outlandish premise and predictable climactic showdown, this smartly-made, super-hero yarn doesn't take itself as seriously as the new 'Batman' movies but still delivers the goods in slam-bang fashion.",10,1,3,15 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Best Batman Movie Ever!!!
","The same people who rebooted Superman back in 2013 with 'Man of Steel' have rebooted the Caped Crusader with 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,' and 'Watchmen' director Zack Snyder treats The Dark Knight character as reverently as he did the Last Son of Krypton. Clocking in at a bladder-challenging 151 minutes, this ambitious costume-clad, crime fighter epic amounts to one of the best and the most rambunctious. Snyder and scenarists Chris Terrio of 'Argo' and David S. Goyer of 'Blade' neither squander a second nor delay the action for reams of expository dialogue. Meantime, you'll see Batman as he has never been portrayed, while Superman is clearly no slouch either. Not only Superman must contend with Batman, but also he finds himself over matched by the monstrous Doomsday. Suffice to say, the hideous Doomsday resembles the Incredible Hulk after his features have been nuked in a microwave. Furthermore, not content merely to reboot just Batman, Snyder and company have ushered Wonder Woman to the silver screen, too, and this dame is no damsel-in-distress. She can hold her own with both Superman and Batman! Snyder clearly loves all three of these larger-than-life characters because he keeps them front and center. Snyder has orchestrated several sensational, over-the-top scenes of close-quarters combat that will make you flinch at every punch thrown and shutter at every smash absorbed. As he did in 'Man of Steel,' Snyder relies heavily on CGI galore to present as much credible collateral damage to Gotham City as he did to Metropolis. Some spectators may scoff at the premise that Batman wouldn't stand a chance against Superman in a straight-up fight. You're right! Batman wouldn't stand a chance, except he is the devious Dark Knight, and he always has an edge when he plunges himself into peril. What makes 'Batman v Superman' such an exhilarating escapade is the changes that occur here and there, along with the surprises that accompany them.'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' unfolds as Superman is battling General Zod over the skies of Metropolis. As it turns out, one of the buildings that topples during this Olympian smack down belongs to billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne. Wayne (Ben Affleck of 'Daredevil') careens into Metropolis at the last minute to rescue an employee, Wallace Keefe (Scoot McNairy of 'Gone Girl'), trapped beneath a girder. Afterward, he notices the devastated little girl about to be creamed by a falling wall and sweeps her to safety. Had he not intervened the poor girl would have died. Wayne struggles with his rage and decides that Superman needs to be reckoned with before he destroys civilization. Meantime, Wayne isn't the only one that Superman alarms. Alexander Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg of 'Zombieland') is just as alarmed. He has his henchmen scouring the globe for anything that will make place him on equal footing the Last Son of Krypton. Namely, one of General Zod's war machines in 'Man of Steel' contained a rock of green Kryptonite. After the destruction of this machine, a large chunk of Kryptonite sank into the Indian Ocean. Luthor's personnel managed to recover it. Naturally, Lex doesn't trust either anybody or anything he cannot control for his own advantage. Indeed, Luthor wants to enter into a pact with Senator Finch (Holly Hunter of 'Raising Arizona') who shares Luthor's anxieties about Superman. Mind you, the timing couldn't be any worse for Superman. He saves Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams of 'American Hustle') when she ventures into the desert to interview a notorious terrorist. No sooner has Superman shown up than the armed guards contracted to safeguard the terrorist wipe out his army. When word of this massacre reaches America, people believe that Superman killed them. Incredibly, Superman consents to appear before a Senate hearing in Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, Superman finds himself caught off-guard by the tragic calamity that ensues. Meanwhile, Batman has been keeping tabs on Lex Luthor. He discovers Luthor's plans to smuggle in the green Kryptonite. Imagine Luthor's surprise when the Dark Knight tries to steal the Kryptonite from his army of henchmen. The high-octane speed chase between Luthor's heavily armed gunmen and Batman in his souped-up Batmobile is gripping demolition derby. Meantime, Luthor has more than Kryptonite at his disposal. The government allows him access to the Kryptonian ship and General Zod's corpse and he conjures up something else that proves just as formidable as Kryptonite.Henry Cavill reprises his role as Superman. Cavill has bulked himself up on more muscle so he looks genuinely Herculean. Superman has a day job now as Clark Kent at The Daily Planet, and Lois Lane still has her eyes on him. Cavill's Superman seems uncharacteristically stern at moments when he confronts his enemies. Meantime, Ben Affleck has inherited the cape and the cowl, and he plays an older, wiser Dark Knight with gray temples. After you watch Affleck's antics as Batman, Christian Bale, George Clooney, Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton, and Adam West pale by comparison. Snyder has fashioned Batman after Frank Miller's classic graphic novel 'The Dark Knight Returns.' This Batman doesn't pussyfoot around with his fiendish foes. He clobbers his opponents without a qualm, and he blasts away at them with an automatic pistol. At one point, when Batman confronts Lex Luthor's trigger-happy henchmen, the Caped Crusader retaliates with fusillades of machine gun fire from two forward gun ports in his armored Batmobile. Snyder strains the PG-13 rating with some rather hardcore violence. Unlike Disney's produced Marvel Super Hero sagas, 'Batman v Superman' shuns humor. The closest thing to a joke occurs when Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot of the 'Fast & Furious' franchise) arrives for the grand finale, and Batman and Superman wonders who invited her. Supposedly, when it hits video, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' will contain more characters and scenes left on the editing room floor that the filmmakers couldn't cram into this blockbuster. Reportedly, the video version of 'Batman v Superman' will come with an R-rating, too.",9,8,14,3 April 2016
Casino Royale," 'Casino Royale' left me neither shaken nor stirred.
","When Sean Connery appeared in the third 007 thriller 'Goldfinger' in 1964, the James Bond film franchise had won audiences over with its surefire formula of combining girls and gadgets with epic international criminal intrigue. James Bond always tangled with megalomaniacal villains whose larger-than-life ambitions dwarfed the skulduggery of commonplace lawbreakers. Each Bond adventure emerged as an event decked out with stunts galore and often a chart-topping title tune. The 'Casino Royale' title tune is instantly forgettable. The formula served the series well as the last Pierce Brosnan 007 thriller 'Die Another Day' amassed more than $400-million-plus at the box office in 2002.Fearful that they couldn't top themselves again and fresh out of imaginative ideas, the Bond producers decided to start from scratch, like George Lucas didwith far greater credibility than he is givenwith 'Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.' Not only did the 007 producers send Pierce Brosnan packing, but they also trashed their tried-and-true formula. Anybody remember the new Coke? Well, Sony and Columbia Pictures, which bought out United Artiststhe distributor of the previous 20 Bond pictureshave unveiled the new Bond. If you look at the money that 'Casino Royale' has generated and you read the critics, the new Bond and the actor impersonating himDaniel Craig of the first 'Tomb Raider' movieare performing better than anybody could have surmised.Most new Bonds amount to underachievers, such as 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' (1969) and 'Live and Lie Die' (1973), and Bonds that forsake the formula usually crash and burn. Aside from its earnings and its widespread critical support, 'Casino Royale' is barely a Bond opus. Neither M's secretaryMiss Moneypennynor Bond's gadget supplying guyQ, show up in the 21st 007 thriller. The producers have dispensed with risqué names for the heroines and the villainesses, and the stunts are largely low-tech. The clever one-liners that our globe-trotting hero spouts and the larger-than-life villains are both conspicuously absent.Instead, 'Casino Royale' qualifies as a prequel, showing how James Bond acquired his license to kill before he became the polished practitioner of seduction and sadism in the earlier 007 outings. No, the new Bond is set in the here and now rather than the yonder of yesteryear. Actually, the black & white opening sequence is supposed to take place before the first Bond movie 'Dr. No' and then the remainder of the moviein coloroccurs after 'Die Another Day.' Along the way, the filmmakers have cherry picked only bits and pieces from the 1953 Ian Fleming original novel where the redoubtable, double-0 agent made his debut.Suffice it to say that 'Casino Royale' establishes James Bond's lethal credentials and shows him gambling with a crafty criminal genius in a high-stakes poker game. Compared with previous Bonds, 'Casino Royale' is about neither the next plot to take over the world nor a devious scheme to mastermind the perfect crime. James Bond earns his license to kill status in the opening black & white sequences that lack any kind of excitement and seem rather like a picnic for him. He beats a guy up in a public restroom and outsmarts an opponent who holds him at gunpoint with an empty weapon. Afterward, Bond makes a buffoon of himself by shooting dead a couple of people at a foreign embassy and getting caught on a surveillance camera in the act of killing! Of course, M (Judi Dench of the Brosnan Bonds) is predictably furious. 'In the old days, if an agent did something that embarrassing, he'd at least have the good sense to defect.' Later, British Intelligence learns that Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen of 'King Arthur'), who bankrolls terrorists, has got to win big at the gambling tables at Casino Royale or face death from one of his savage, machete-wielding African clients. M sends Bond to beat Le Chiffre at cards, and the British Treasury assigns Vesper Lynd (Parisian actress Eva Green of 'Kingdom of Heaven') to see that 007 doesn't blow the big bucks.'GoldenEye' director Martin Campbell is back calling the shots on Bond 21. He must have forgotten, however, what makes a good Bond. First, 'Casino Royale' clocks in at 144 tedious minutes, the longest Bond on recordlonger than Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service.' Second, there are lengthy stretches where nothing extraordinary happens. The color opening set piece where Bond and a black villain cavort around a construction site as if they had wings on their ankles grows tiresome but looks spectacular. Later, a white-knuckled fight in a motel stairwell goes on ad-nauseam. The chief villain is appropriately ruthless, but he doesn't do anything to make you genuinely hate him. He does whip Bond into a frenzy in one scene, but that's small potatoes compared with other Bond bad guys. Actually, the secondary villains pose more of a threat than Le Chiffre and his clowns. Most, 'Casino Royale' is humdrum and humorless in its efforts to be realistic.The Robert Wade and Neal Purvis screenplay offers few surprises (especially if you've perused the Ian Fleming novel) and the movie serves up two false endings before an explosive but hardly exciting finale in urban renewal in the exotic city of Venice. The only thing that differentiates Le Chiffre is his ability to shed a bloody tear or two. Daniel Craig plays James Bond as a hopelessly straightforward and tight-lipped, blue-collar thug with muscles. He resembles a cross-between of Steve McQueen of 'Bullitt' and Yoda from 'Star Wars.' He is tough and rugged but lacks charisma. Furthermore, he has to rely on others to get him out of tight spots. Indeed, if it weren't for Vesper Lynd, Bond would never have accomplished his missionbittersweet as it turns out.'Casino Royale' ranks as an uninspired but ambitious stab to make over one of the most successful franchises in film history. As a traditional, old-school Bond fan, 'Casino Royale' left me neither shaken nor stirred.",10,9,16,9 June 2008
Trainspotting," Tour De Force Anti-Heroin Opus
","You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. 'Shallow Grave' director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, 'Trainspotting' isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on 'his own sensory addiction.' He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro. Another Danny Boyle classic!",10,1,3,13 August 2013
The Deer Hunter," Adequate but Unexceptional!
","If movies reflect the real sentiments of society, perhaps the cinema has been telling us what we've known for ages yet seem to forget with each generationthe horror of war. More than the horror of war alone, the current crop of films about Vietnam depicts the conflict as an exercise in futility. Whether Vietnam technically qualifies as a 'war' is now academic, but for the men who fought and died in it, Vietnam was a 'war'unconventional and without glory. In 'Thunderbolt & Lightfoot' director Michael Cimino's 'The Deer Hunter,' with Robert De Niro, three young Americans volunteer for the adventure of combat in Southeast Asia in the late 1960s as an alternative to the humdrum oblivion of life in a Northern mill town. The nightmare that they plunge themselves into when they Vietnam is a descent into chaos from which they never recover.The plot of 'The Deer Hunter' is both epic and episodic. The first half of this 182-minute epic concerns the characters before they embark for the 'Nam.' They live in a small town whose activities revolve around a steel mill. About the only pastimes they can revel in are boozing at a friend's bar and hunting. The second half occurs in Vietnam. They are captured, escape, and return to civilian life, with mental and physical scars that they cannot conquer. Sadly, the filmmakers have had to pare down their mini-series plot to accommodate the two to three hour running time. Some scenes wear out their welcome. The wedding, for example, is a grandiose spectacle in an awesome church. But Cimino wallows in the spectacle of the wedding to excess. Indeed, the ceremony is as interesting as its setting is magnificent, but it does little to advance the plot. The entire wedding ceremony qualifies as the chick flick part of this war film.Never does Cimino foreshadow his transitions. The changes of locale from America to Vietnam and from combat to capture are distressingly abrupt. 'The Deer Hunter' emerges as an uneven, series of loosely strung together scenes that are more powerful than their overall design. At times, too, the symbolism is so obvious as to be corny. During the wedding, John Savage and Meryl Streep drink a toast to their marriage. If they drink without spilling a drop, they will have good luck. In a close-up, we see an unnoticed fleck of wine stain her dress. Other scenes seem unconsciously funny. Michael (Robert De Niro), the hero of the movie, who is the 'The Deer Hunter' of the title, is shown in a hunting scene stalking a deer. He edges up on one side of the slope framed by majestic mountains and raises his rifle. The camera pans to reveal a deer poised not far off as proudly as the deer in the Hartford Insurance commercial. If that isn't sufficient, the music behind the scene is a heavenly choir that celebrates the relationship of De Niro to the deer in the game of the hunt, a solemn heroic act. How pretentious!Director Michael Cimino does direct 'The Deer Hunter' with verve. They early mill town scenes have gusto galore, and the setting of the film is solidly established by the era's popular music. The Russian roulette scenes are painfully intense, almost unbearable, and very convincing. Unfortunately, Cimino never gives his audience a chance either to breathe or laugh. 'The Deer Hunter' is dramatically intense to the point of monotonous. 'Deliverance' lenser Vilmos Zsigmond's beautiful, sweeping photography at least makes the film a visual delight. As war movies go, 'The Deer Hunter' breaks no new ground. Actually, it's more about the effect of war on the characters, played by a superb cast, than Vietnam. If you're looking for an exciting, entertaining action epic, skip 'The Deer Hunter.' However, if you like fare that nourishes your intellect as well as your eye and doesn't have a happy ending, see 'The Deer Hunter.'",7,0,3,20 June 2008
Beowulf," An Hilarious Grendel and Bad Animation Defeat 'Beowulf'
","Any students that believe they can watch the new cartoon movie 'Beowulf' and then fool their English literature professors into believing that they read the 6th century Anglo-Saxon epic poem are in for a rude awakening. Indeed, none of the film or television versions of the Beowulf legend have kept the action of the original old English poem intact. As the first adaptation of the ancient Beowulf yarn, 'Grendel Grendel Grendel' (1981) drew itsstoryline from author John Gardner's 1971 novella 'Grendel.' Gardner depicted the hideous Grendel monster in a sympathetic light. Not only was 'Grendel Grendel Grendel' the first attempt at filming Beowulf, but the movie also relied on animation to render its larger-than-life events. In 1998, the BBC and HBO teamed up to televise a second cartoon version appropriately entitled 'Beowulf,' with the incomparable London stage actor Sir Derek Jacobi serving as narrator. Later, British director Graham Baker helmed the first majorattempt to film the vintage Old English poem. Baker cast 'Highlander' actor Christopher Lambert as the protagonist in 'Beowulf' (1999), but it departed drastically from the poem, too. Essentially an outlandish science fiction spin on the fable, Baker changed the setting of 'Beowulf' from ancient times to the post-apocalyptic future. Meanwhile, Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarsson's tedious 'Beowulf & Grendel' (2005) with '300' star Gerard Butler, emerged as the next major television rehash, and Gunnarsson treated the Grendel monster as an outcast human. More recently, The Sci-Fi Channel aired its version of Beowulf back in January of 2007 and called it 'Grendel,' but it differed in several aspects from the original poem, too.Not surprisingly, 'Back to the Future' director Robert Zemeckis' new'Beowulf' takes considerable liberties with the source material. Director Robert Zemeckis states unequivocally in a promotional video for 'Beowulf' that his film 'Right now, I can only say that this has nothing to do with the Beowulf that you were forced to read in junior high school.' Zemeckis goes on to say, 'It's all about eating, drinking, killing and fornicating.' Imagine what the sword & sandal saga '300' would look like if it were done as a cartoon, and you'll know what to expect from 'Beowulf.' Unfortunately, Zemeckis' use of state-of-the-art, motion capture technology, which converts real-life actors into cartoon figures, is both its chief claim to fame as well as its main liability.Scribes Roger ('Pulp Fiction') Avary and Neil ('Stardust') Gaiman dispense with the poem's opening lineage passages and launch headlong into the myth. As the story unfolds, King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins of 'Fracture') and his Danish subjects are about to christen a massive mead hall—something akin to a private corporate camp house--with women, liquor, and loud music. Amazingly, Hrothgar and company create such uproar that it enrages Grendel, a truly pathetic-looking monster in the snow-swept wilderness not far away from the hall. This murderous fiend storms the mead hall and slaughters warriors left and right. Here, Grendel (Crispin Glover of 'Willard') resembles a cross-between of an evil juvenile delinquent straight out of an 'Aqua Team Hunger Force' TV episode and a huge emaciated cadaver. Basically, Grendel consists of bone and sinew, but he is merciless when he goes on a rampage.Naturally, Grendel's bloody massacre horrifies Hrothgar, and the king summons any and all warriors willing to risk their necks, to slay Grendel. A Swedish warrior named Beowulf (paunchy Ray Winstone of 'The Departed') and his sword-wielding soldiers arrive after a rigorous voyage. Hrothgar reopens the hall. Beowulf strips nude and sets aside his arsenal of weapons. He plans to kill Grendel with his bare hands. Later that evening after all the revelers have passed out, Grendel surprises them, but the warriors are ready for him. Beowulf rips off Grendel's arm, and the monster vamooses. Not long afterward, Grendel's mother appears and challenges Beowulf. Grendel's mother is not the hag in the poem. Instead, she emerges as a sexy, shape-shifting siren in stiletto heels, played by 'Tomb Raider' star Angelina Jolie.What Avary and Gaiman have scripted is not much more than a standard 'Conan' movie, except for the alluring power that Grendel's mother exerts over King Hrothgar and later Beowulf. The two writers have filled in the gaps between the three major set-pieces; (1) Beowulf's battle with Grendel, (2) Beowulf's combat with Grendel's mom, and decades later (3) the fight with a dragon. In doing so, Avary andmGaiman argue that King Hrothgar had a tryst with Grendel's mom and sired their illegitimate offspring.Altogether, Zemeckis' ambitious but underwhelming 'Beowulf' resembles a souped version of an 1960's Jonny Quest episode, unless you're fortunate enough to catch the 3-D version of this movie in an IMAX Theater. The animated eyes of the characters lack the vivacity of actual humans. Furthermore, their hands are crudely drawn and they look hilarious when they run. Despite the considerable advances made in photo-realistic, motion capture technology, 'Beowulf' forfeits the subtly nuanced acting skills of thespians like Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Crispin Glover, Robin Wright Penn, and Brendan Gleeson. Meanwhile, everything non-human looks terrific. All works of literature and film are linked by universality. 'Beowulf' constitutes the 6th century equivalent of a 21st century home invasion. Sadly, the hilarious looking Grendel villain and the less-than spectacular animation of the principal actors defeats 'Beowulf.'",5,3,6,29 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," One Big Dumb Fun Action Movie!
","Before he starred in 'Die Hard' back in 1988 as NYPD Detective John McClane, Bruce Willis' chief claim to fame was playing David Addison, Jr., opposite Cybill Shepherd 's Maddie Hayes for four seasons on the ABC-TV comedy series 'Moonlighting.' 'Die Hard' turned Willis into a superstar, and he reprised the role in 'Die Hard 2' (1990) and again in 1995 for the far grittier 'Die Hard With A Vengeance.' In 'Underworld' director Len Wiseman's anti-terrorist thriller 'Live Free or Die Hard,' Willis revives the alpha male hero that made him into a celebrity, but he looks nothing like he did twelve years ago. Talk about a makeover, NYPD Detective John McClane has lost his hair, his cigarettes, and his locker room profanity. Unlike the previous 'Die Hard' actioneers which carried edgy R-ratings, 'Live Free or Die Hard' accommodates a wider audience demographic with a bland PG-13 rating. (Not surprisingly, an unrated 'Die Hard' is available on DVD with the profanity that the studio snipped from the film.) This means that McClane cannot give the villains a lead headache with a 9mm. Moreover, it means that anything approaching realism has given way to fantasy. The earlier 'Die Hard' thrillers relied on realism for their high-octane, adrenalin-laced action sequences, but 'Live Free or Die Hard' shuns realism for the sake of raking in more bucks at the box office. Indeed, 'Live Free or Die Hard' often resembles a theme park ride as our indestructible hero performs feats above and beyond James Bond. Bruce flies helicopters; Bruce eludes a jet fighter packing missiles that can hover and take aim under and over an array of bridges; and Bruce wields an automobile like a slingshot to demolish the bad guys in a helicopter. Altogether, Bruce pulls America by its chestnuts out of the fire from an ambitious villain that wants to meltdown the country.Mark Bomback's moth-eaten screenplay draws its inspiration from a 1997 'Wired' magazine article inked by John Carlin about the prospect that hackers could trigger an Armageddon against Democracy by exploiting our widespread reliance on computers to run everything in America. Anybody watching movies before 1997 knew that recipe for disaster before the Carlin article. The 1995 Sandra Bullock cyberspace nail-biter 'The Net' showed that a hacker could steal an individual's identity. The same year that 'The Net' appeared with its cyberspace threat to privacy, the first Pierce Brosnan 007 epic 'GoldenEye' boasted a villain who tried to melt down everything in the UK with his cyberspace terrornauts and steal a fortune! Sadly, then, the premise that pits McClane against a brilliant but insane computer whiz with fiendish plans for America has already been done! Worse, 'Scream 2' nemesis Timothy Olyphant presents only a minor physical threat to McClane. He is nowhere near as lethal as either Alan Rickman in 'Die Hard' or Jeremy Irons in 'Die Hard With A Vengeance.' Indeed, the surprise ending relies on the villain's woeful ignorance.The saving grace of 'Live Free and Die Hard' is its refusal to take itself seriously. Director Len Wiseman has created the ultimate 'big, dumb action movie.' In big, dumb action movies, forty-seven bad guys with automatic weapons can pin the hero in a phone booth and put a hole through everything except him! Not only does Wiseman appropriate these clichés, but also he exaggerates them to such preposterous proportions that you want to howl at his audacity. 'Live Free and Die Hard' is the kind of movie where the hero has to beat the living daylights out of a villain because it would be too violent for him to just shoot them. For example, when McClane tangles with the villain's girlfriend, Mai Lihn (Maggie Q of 'Rush Hour 2'), a seductive doll with a Ph.D. in cyberspace terrorism and martial arts, he has no more luck knocking her off than the teens did Jason in the 'Friday the 13th' chillers. When McClane isn't dealing with this dame, he contends with an acrobatic fiend who caroms off walls like Jackie Chan and run circles around our hero. The secondary villains more than the chief villain give 'Live Free and Die Hard' half of its best moments. Meanwhile, the chief villain, Thomas Gabriel, is more loquacious than lethal. Ironically, he spends most of his time telling us how dangerous that he is. 'Clerks' writer/director Kevin Smithnearly bloated beyond recognition--makes a more interesting impression as a hacker who lives with his mom, rather like the Vince Vaughn character in 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith.' When McClane isn't swapping words, fists, or lead with his adversaries, he barrels a semi-tractor trailer rig over bridges toppling like dominos behind him while a jet pilot cannot hit him with either missiles or bullets any more than the forty-seven machine gun wielding thugs. Watching Willis recreate the feisty McClane, McClane's bouts with the second-string villains, and the most outlandish feats ever staged compensate for the absence of a memorable villain, the encore use of a hacker plot to destroy a world power, and Bruce Willis's missing hairpiece. Enjoy 'Live Free and Die Hard' for the PG-13 rated big, dumb action movie that it is.",8,1,4,4 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," Better Than The First Film
","'X-2: X-Men United' ranks as an exemplary Marvel superhero epic with the cast from director Bryan Singer's superb first film 'X-Men' reprising their respective roles. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), the telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), laser beams in his eyes Cyclops (James Marsden), as well as shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos); Iceman (Shawn Ashmore),; Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who can hurl flames but needs a pilot light, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can take on aspects of the personalities around her. This above-average sequel carries on what Twentieth Century Fox charted in the initial breakthrough yarn. Nightcrawler (Alan Cummings) joins the action along with Brian Cox as the evil villain General William Stryker. Whereas Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) tangled with the renegade mastermind Magneto (Ian McKellen) in the first film, these two adversaries teamed up together to thwart an obnoxious government scientist, Stryker (Brian Cox), from butchering the world's mutant population. Stryker gets the White House on his side after Nightcrawler teleports himself into the Oval Office and Strkyer convinces the Chief Executive that they should monitor Xavier's school for gifted mutants.",10,1,1,19 August 2016
Thor: The Dark World," 'Thor 2' Will Floor You!!!
","Chris Hemsworth wields his mighty hammer Mjölnir for the second time as the brawny Norse deity in 'Game of Thrones' director Alan Taylor's 'Thor: The Dark World.' Happily, virtually everybody from director Kenneth Branagh's immaculate but lackluster predecessor reprises their respective roles. 'Thor: The Dark World' boasts a sufficiently complex plot with more than enough grandiose escapades intermingled with amusing antics to keep you distracted throughout its swiftly-paced 112 minutes. The first 'Thor' came up short on spectacle and surprises, but the sequel delivers several bolts from the blue that keep its outlandish but formulaic shenanigans invigorating. Charismatic performances from the brawny, blond Hemsworth; the brainy, brunette Natalie Portman; the maniacal Christopher Eccleston; and the treacherous Tom Hiddleston enliven this imaginative Marvel Comics entry. Not only does 'Thor: The Dark World' surpass its humdrum 'origins' predecessor, but it also picks up the saga where the superlative'Avengers' left off. Indeed, some things haven't changed. Odin isn't entirely pleased with his son's rebellious behavior, and their troubled relationship puts our hero at odds with his one-eyed father. Despite Odin's stern objections, Thor rekindles his romance with astrophysicist Jane Foster after a two year absence. Eventually, Thor tangles with a sinister army of Dark Elves and their ultimate doomsday weapon that threatens to obliterate not only Earth but also the Nine Realms of the Universe. No, 'Thor: The Dark World' isn't quite as entertaining overall as either 'The Avengers' or 'Iron Man 3.' Nevertheless, Taylor and scenarists Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely, working from a story by Don Payne and Robert Rodat, manage to mobilize enough machismo, mayhem, and self-mockery to make it worth watching more than once. 'Thor: The Dark World' unfolds centuries before Odin (Anthony Hopkins of 'Hannibal') entrusted the legendary hammer to his impetuous son Thor. According to Odin, Thor's grandfather Bor invaded Alfheim with an army of Asgard warriors and routed the rodent-faced legion of Dark Elves in a pitched battle. The leader of the Elves, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston of the BBC's 'Dr. Who' television series), had sought to use a doomsday weapon called the Aether. This Aether resembles a red and black confetti-like substance that swirls ominously in the air. Bor trapped the Aether and buried it in the ground. Several millenniums later, Thor's old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman of 'Black Swam') discovers a portal between London, England and the Dark World. Unfortunately, the Aether infects Jane. Thor comes to Jane's rescue and ushers her to Asgard for treatment. Initially, Odin is far from ecstatic about this turn of events. Actually, Thor's father believes his son should stick to his own kind. He urges Thor to take Sif (Jaimie Alexander of 'The Last Stand') as his bride. The Dark Elves launch their own invasion of Asgard, and one of its most prominent residents dies during the onslaught. Reluctantly, Thor recruits his two-timing, half-brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston of 'War Horse') to help him. Meantime, Malekith unleashes mass destruction on London as our heroes scramble to save the day.You really cannot fault the writing in 'Thor: The Dark World.' The capable scenarists know their subject matter. Christopher Yost has penned several episodes of various Marvel television series, including 'Wolverine and the X-Men,' 'Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes,' and 'Iron Man: Armored Adventures.' Similarly, Markus and Stephen McFeely collaborated on both 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and its sequel 'Captain America: Winter Soldier.' Taylor and his writers take Thor and company on some adrenaline, roller-coaster rides that include jaunts through wormholes in time as well as one adrenaline-laced aerial pursuit in a huge, T-shaped, flying aircraft and later in a boat that cruises on the wind. Taylor choreographs several epic combat sequences that shun blood, sweat and tears, but keep you shadow boxing with our heroes. Naturally, our heroes survive by the skin of their teeth. The malevolent Dark Elves appear quite sinister with their pale, cadaverous masks and their minions look equally intimidating in appearance and number. They possess a Darth Vader quality and are determined to triumph over Thor and company. Twice as visually stunning as the resplendent original was, 'Thor: The Dark World' pits our protagonists against some supernatural opponents, such as a gargantuan creature made up of stones and a gigantic beast that resembles a hybrid of a bull and a hippopotamus. Taylor and company lighten up the slam-bang action heroics with clever humor that enables you to laugh when you aren't flinching at all the acrobatic fisticuffs. Hemsworth uses Mjölnir with the ease of and hurls it like a boomerang during some scenes. Thor's quartet of faithful brethren, Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Fandral (Zachary Levi), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), and Hugan (Tadanobu Asano), have developed a camaraderie that is displayed in the way that Taylor stages their action scenes. They keep tabs on each other in the midst of all the chaos and often save each other from certain death.Performances are robust with each character getting a moment or two to radiate their personality, particularly Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Kat Dennings, and Natalie Portman. Audiences should know that the film doesn't grind to a complete halt when the end-credits roll. Two scenes ensue at different intervals and furnish foreshadowing as well as closure and comedy. One prominent S.H.I.E.L.D. agent whose own sequel is scheduled for a Spring 2014 release appears briefly in a side-splitting cameo. Naturally, Marvel Comics co-creator Stan Lee shows up in one scene and blurts an uproarious line. This 'Thor' will floor you!",8,2,8,11 November 2013
Lucy," You'll Love 'Lucy!!!'
","You'll love 'Lucy.' French filmmaker Luc Besson, who helmed 'Le Femme Nikita,' 'Angel-A,' and 'Colombiana,' takes the feminist-oriented action thriller to the next level. This outlandish but entertaining hokum chronicles the mutation of a young damsel-in-distress into an invincible dame with heretofore unheard of mental powers. Our provocative protagonist comes to rely more on her brains than her biology. Comparably, 'Lucy' reminded me a little of the 2004 movie 'Maria Full of Grace.' Columbian drug dealers planted cocaine into the stomach of a teenage girl in 'Maria Full of Grace' and used her to smuggle their narcotics into the United States. Happily, this savvy babe turned the tables on her captors! Similarly, our heroine in 'Lucy' finds a bag of exotic synthetic drugs sew into her tummy and given a plane ticket for America. The last thing that her savagely coldblooded captors are prepared for is her unlikely reprisal. Lucy turns the tables on them in ways that not even she could have imagined before she encountered these merciless hooligans. Indeed, actress Scarlett Johansson would be the whole show if Morgan Freeman weren't lecturing in cutaways as a prestigious physician, Professor Samuel Norman, whose ranks as the foremost expert on gray matter. When Professor Norman isn't delivering lectures to enthralled audiences about the percentage of use that humans derive from their noodles, Besson treats us to illuminating National Geographic documentary excerpts of jungle animals that punctuate the running battle Lucy has with the heavily-armed Asian drug smugglers. Korean actor Choi Min-shik, who starred in director Chan-wook Park's first version of the revenge thriller 'Oldboy' (2003), makes a memorable villain named Mr. Jang that you will love to hate. Furthermore, Mr. Jang's immaculately tailored henchmen are as homicidal as he is until he meets our feminist heroine after she experiences a massive change in her attitude. Interestingly enough, before she made 'Lucy,' Scarlett Johansson made 'Under the Skin,' a sci-fi thriller about an alien who masquerades as a human who preys on lonely men in Scotland. For the record, Besson had cast Angelina Jolie as the lead, but Jolie had to drop out, so Johansson stepped into the part.The first time we see Lucy (Scarlett Johansson of 'The Avengers'), she is arguing with her straw cowboy-hat clad scummy boyfriend, Richard (Pilou AsbÃ¦k of 'The Whistleblower'), in front of a fashionable, high-rise hotel in Taiwan. Richard is struggling to convince Lucy to deliver a sleek briefcase to a motel guest named Mr. Jang. Richard insists that he cannot personally hand the briefcase over to Mr. Jang. Lucy refuses to deliver the briefcase. She asks Richard about the contents of the briefcase. As it turns out, Richard doesn't have a clue about what is in the briefcase. Their entire argument sounds like something that Quentin Tarantino's characters argued about in 'Pulp Fiction.' Everything in the seminal crime thriller 'Pulp Fiction' turned on the mysterious contents of a cryptic briefcase. Just as Lucy is about to walk away from Richard, the jerk of a scumbag handcuffs the brief case to her wrist so she cannot get it off. Eventually, she relents and enters the motel while Richard watches her. Suffice to say, things go downhill like an avalanche for both Richard and our heroine. The action sequences in 'Lucy' are breathtaking, especially the predictable but exciting car chase through Paris. Besson charts the action according to the percentage of brainpower that our heroine is able to harness until fade-out when she concludes her incredible metamorphosis.Quite simply, 'Lucy' unfolds as a standard-issue, darkly-themed, revenge thriller in the vein of something notorious horror maestro Eli Roth of 'Hostel' fame would perpetrate. About half-way through its lean, mean 90 minutes, this nimble Universal Pictures release changes our protagonist from a shanghaied schoolgirl into a gal who doesn't need a guy to save her bacon. She becomes the equivalent of Liam Neeson in the 'Taken' thrillers and then she even surpasses him! She doesn't even have to rely on guns. Initially, the villains round up not only poor Lucy but also three other guys and sew several bags of strange blue crystals called CPH4 into their bodies. Basically, CPH4 amounts to the equivalent of stuff that pregnant moms produce to cultivate their fetuses. Somebody utters ominously enough about the substance: ''For a baby, it packs the power of an atomic bomb.'' Our ingenious heroine manages to escape the clutches of the bad guys, and she alerts the authorities about herself and the other mules. Unfortunately, the police aren't prepared for the commitment that the criminals have to their product. As the bullets begin to fly, bodies stack up in piles. These villains are armed with more than just fully automatic weapons. Before the dust settles, however, Besson's crime thriller transforms into a mind-boggling science fiction actioneer reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Literally, the heroine becomes the equivalent of the monolith in the Kubrick film. Indeed, the ending is a mind blower in itself and you may feel cheated by the ending. Nevertheless, nothing that you have seen this summer will prepare you for this supercharged little saga.",9,0,8,3 August 2014
Midway," The Best Cinematic Account of Midway
","Historians classify the battle of Midway in 1942 as the turning point of World War II in the Pacific. Since invading Manchuria in 1931, the Japanese had been on a roll. This runaway success lost momentum on June 7th, just six months after their surprise attack on December 7th devastated Pearl Harbor. The earliest movie about Midway appeared in September 1942. Renowned Hollywood director John Ford lensed battlefield footage of the Midway attack for an 18-minute documentary. Indeed, Ford filmed the bombs as they fell! Later, director Henry Hathaway's 'Wing and A Prayer' (1944) was the first Hollywood feature-length film about this landmark battle. Audiences would have to wait until 1976, when Universal Pictures released director Jack Smight's 'Midway,' starring Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, and Glenn Ford to commemorate this extraordinary victory. Ironically, German director Roland Emmerich's 'Midway' qualifies as the best version of the battle. Apart from Ford's documentary, no movie about the Midway victory has bristled with the amount of historical content as Emmerich's film. Mind you, no movie can ever claim to be 100 percent authentic. For example, the U.S. carrier-based planes were the wrong color, and the decks of Japanese flattops weren't painted the color yellow. Nevertheless, Emmerich's epic clearly tops anything done about this Japanese defeat. Every character is based on an actual individual. Virtually every line of dialogue contains material about the battle. Hampered by an inadequate budget, Emmerich and freshman scenarist Wes Tooke have done a commendable job of depicting the clash from both American and Japanese perspectives.Unfortunately, this ambitious depiction is as comprehensive as most armchair admirals would probably prefer. Of course, money dictates everything in Hollywood. Reportedly, the most expensive independent film in history, 'Midway' boasted a budget of a $100 million, but it wasn't adequate to cover the whole fracas. Comparably, 'Midway' (1976) relied chiefly on recycled war movie footage and vintage newsreels spliced into star-studded command post scenes to recreate a fight which Universal Pictures could hardly have afforded on its relatively modest budget. Meantime, Emmerich's dramatization created authentic-looking, computer-generated imagery to immortalize this seemingly implausible American triumph. Three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers participated at Midway. Emmerich concentrates on the U.S.S. Hornet and the U.S.S. Enterprise, but he relegates the U.S.S. Yorktown to the periphery. Furthermore, the film omits one of Midway's greatest heroes: Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron, who led a squadron of 15 Douglas TBD-1 Devastator torpedo planes from the Hornet. Tragically, the Japanese slaughtered Waldron's squadron. One of Waldron's fliers--Ensign George Gay--survived this catastrophe. Ditching in the ocean, Gay had a ringside seat to watch his compatriots sink a Japanese aircraft carrier.In 'Midway,' Emmerich intersperses scenes of the codebreakers at Pearl Harbor with scenes aboard the aircraft carriers Hornet and Enterprise. After the debacle of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt orders Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson of 'Zombieland') to destroy the Japanese Imperial Navy and take the U.S. Navy into Tokyo Bay. Nimitz relies on Lieutenant Commander Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson of 'The Conjuring') and Navy Intelligence cryptologists. They intercepted enemy radio messages and then predicted where they thought the Japanese might strike. Meantime, the film shifts from war councils to a rivalry between Navy aviators Wade McClusky (Luke Evans of 'Dracula Untold') and Richard 'Dick' Best (Ed Skrein of 'Deadpool'), who commanded two bomb squadrons. Back at Pearl Harbor, Best's wife Ana (Mandy Moore of '47 Meters Down') worries about her husband.Otherwise, 'Midway' ranks as an old-fashioned World War II epic like 'The Longest Day' (1962), the D-Day classic featuring a star-studded cast headlined by John Wayne. The battle of Midway is reminiscent of the desperate attack on the Death Star in George Lucas' classic sci-fi saga 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' (1977). Lucas patterned 'Star Wars' in some respects on several World War II era battles. At the time of this Pacific War battle, the U.S. Navy was struggling for survival against a clearly superior enemy that had out-numbered, out-gunned, and out-fought them. If you reviewed the battle on paper, the Japanese enjoyed an overwhelming edge. The Japanese were forged in fire and seasoned by experience, something their American adversaries lacked. Our planes couldn't match the legendary Japanese Zero fighter planes. These Zeroes descended in swarms onto the American pilots and shot them to ribbons. Just as Pearl Harbor had been a military intelligence failure for America, the Japanese underestimated not only the American fighting spirit but also our unwillingness to capitulate. Early in 'Midway,' Japanese Admiral Yamamoto describes the U.S. as 'a sleeping giant' waiting to be awakened. Yamamoto knew Japan couldn't survive a drawn-out war with America and its industrial superiority. Therefore, he planned Midway as a stroke to destroy what remained of the U.S. Navy fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor.Unlike 'Midway' (1976), Emmerich and Took have put the famous battle into the context of World War II. Layton chats with Yamamoto before the Japanese created the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.' Later, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor without warning and sink the battleship U.S.S. Arizona. Best loses a beloved Annapolis roommate. Meanwhile, Admiral William F. Halsey (Dennis Quaid of 'Wyatt Earp'), suffers from a mysterious skin ailment, and Nimitz packs him off to the hospital. He replaces Halsey with Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Webber of 'Meet Joe Black') who distinguishes himself, despite his lack of knowledge about aircraft carriers. The combat aerial scenes are breathtaking, especially when we are looking over a tail assembly of an American SBD Dauntless dive bomber before it plunges from several thousand feet to bomb a Japanese carrier. Clocking in at two hours and 18 minutes, 'Midway' teems with fascinating details. For example, U.S. torpedoes were unreliable. Often, they bounced harmlessly off the hulls of Japanese ships without exploding. War movie buffs, military veterans, and historians are going to salute 'Midway' for its factual approach and its meticulous reenactment.",8,3,4,26 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Wonderfully Derivative
","Apparently, 'Star Trek' and 'Star Trek into Darkness' director J.J. Abrams adopted the strategy 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' for Disney's revival of George Lucas' 'Star War' franchise. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' qualifies as an uninspired but entertaining science fiction/fantasy saga with spectacular CGI special effects. Unfortunately, it suffers from half-baked villains and a shamelessly derivative script. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt must have cherry-picked their favorite scenes and characters from earlier 'Star Wars' epics, retooled them for this reboot, and then placed them in similar order to comply with the formula. Originally, George Lucas hired Kasdan to rewrite 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi,' while Arndt wrote 'The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire' and 'Toy Story 3.' Despite this gifted talent, Abrams and company don't awaken as much as recycle the Force. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' duplicates the formulaic narrative of the original trilogy without a flaw, but Abrams cannot conjure up Lucas' buoyant spirit of feel-good spontaneity. Nevertheless, unless you're a nit-picky franchise aficionado, you'll have four reasons to appreciate this melodramatic franchise reboot from the House of Mouse. First, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a full-fledged sequel instead of a prequel. (Mind you, the prequels weren't entirely ponderous, and each chronicled Anakin Skywalker's walk on the dark side.) Second, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker return after a 32-year hiatus. Mind you, C3P0 and R2-D2 are back, but they linger on the periphery. A new droid designated BB-8 replaces R2-D2 as comic relief. Third, Harrison Ford gives one of his strongest performances as Han Solo. You'll enjoy his shenanigans with the 'rathars,' tentacled, carnivorous, alien predators aboard his spaceship. Abrams confines Carrie Fisher to the sidelines, while Mark Hamill appears at the last minute. London-born Daisy Ridley, whose character draws on both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, is the fourth reason you'll want to see the seventh movie again. You won't take your eyes off this scrappy waif until Solo emerges to challenge her dominance. 'Attack the Block' actor John Boyega plays the most interesting new character but his character appears to be given the short-shrift, Combat fighter pilot Oscar Isaac of 'The Bourne Legacy' emulates Han Solo with his daredevil aerial skills. At the least, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' amounts to a swiftly plotted, larger-than-life, crowd-pleasing space opera with dialogue that propels the plot.The fourth sequel unfolds on the desolate, sun-scorched planet of Jakku. A lone girl named Rey (Daisy Ridley of 'Scrawl') survives by scavenging parts from a crashed Empire starship. She lives alone in the desert. Eventually, Rey rescues an adorable little droid BB-8 from another native scavenger. BB-8 is an insufferably scene-stealer. Meantime, the infamous First Order regime has risen from the ashes of the defeated Empire. These imperialist minded maniacs are no different from their draconian predecessors. They've been scouring the galaxy like bloodhounds for the last surviving Jedi knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill of 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'), and they've finally located a lead on Jakku. Simultaneously, the rebel Resistance, led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), has dispatched a pilot, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac of 'Ex Machina'), to retrieve information from Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow of 'The Exorcist') about Luke's whereabouts. No sooner has San Tekka confided in Poe than the First Order, led by wannabe Dark Vader lookalike Kylo Ren (Adam Driver of 'Lincoln'), arrives with squads of Stormtroopers. One of those armor-clad soldiers, FN-2187 (John Boyega), suffers a crisis of conscience and deserts from the ranks when he is ordered to massacre innocents. FN-2187's superior, Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie of 'The Zero Theorem'), keeps him under close scrutiny because he refused to fire his blaster. Although the First Order rounded up Poe, FN-2187 sticks around long enough to rescue him. He pretends to take him at gunpoint into the hanger. They steal a TIE fighter but crash on Jakku. Eventually, a lost and wandering FN-2187 befriends Rey. When maurading Stormtroopers invade Jakku, our heroes stumble accidentally onto Han Solo's long, lost Millennium Falcon and steal it to escape. Han intercepts them while engaged on a mission to deliver exotic but carnivorous alien wildlife.Despite a fresh crop of new characters, including Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, Kylo Ren, and Snoke, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' imitates virtually everything in the six previous entries as well as the title. Han Solo's cliffhanger confrontation and the finale with the new Death Star situated in a planet recalls the original. Helmer J.J. Abrams directs with slick but soulless efficiency. Rarely does he let the breathless momentum abate. When the momentum does slacken, however, you realize that this is just a glossy facsimile. Of course, unless you have seen the first six films, you may not recognize the rampant similarities since you'll be too swept up in the whirlwind of heroics. Happily, Rey emerges as a tenacious but sympathetic female version of Luke. The charismatic Ridley radiates personality galore, and casting her as the no-nonsense heroine was a stroke of genius. She shares two scenes with Luke's old lightsaber, and she wields it with surprising familiarity the second time. It should be obvious that Rey is Luke's daughter, but we'll have to wait for Rian Johnson's 'Star Wars: Chapter VIII' to confirm this matter. Rey makes a greater impression on-screen than either Finn or Poe. Finn and Poe received some of Han Solo's attributes. Finn cannot tolerate the amoral regimen of a Stormtrooper, and Poe rivals Han's superior skills as a pilot without his mercenary impulses. Kylo Ren resembles Anakin Skywalker, but Ren emerges as far more murderous. Although Kylo Ren is every bit as dastardly as Darth Vader behind the helmet, he doesn't dredge up adequate dread to match him as an adversary. Meanwhile, the holographic Snoke pales by comparison with the evil Emperor. Altogether, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' doesn't depart from the classic formula, but provides a few surprises, like Daisy Ridley.",8,3,32,17 January 2016
RED," Bland Comic Thriller
","The message of the new Bruce Willis action-comedy 'Red' is that old coots kick ass. Ostensibly based on the limited-run, three-issue, DC Comics graphic novel, this sophomoric spy versus spy saga pits a quartet of retired but elite black op spies against every gun that the CIA can assemble. The cliché in all spy movies is loyal spies always wind up dodging bullets from their own folks rather than their foes. Ironically, an old Soviet spy pitches in to help our heroes. Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and John Malkovich play the coots who wield arms against the CIA. Not only do they kick the CIA in the pants, but they also convince some of the smarter CIA folks to knock-off the idiots that wanted our old heroes dead. 'Time Traveler's Wife' director Robert Schwentke does a better job of staging some dramatic action scenes with fusillades of gunfire and fireball explosions galore than 'Whiteout' screenwriters Erich and Jon Hoeber did with adapting the Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner graphic novel. 'Red,' an acronym for 'retired, extremely dangerous,' qualifies as a lame-brained, half-baked shoot'em up with too much set-up and not enough pay-off. Meaning, Schwentke and his scenarists conjure up some half-hearted hokum about Willis and company going after the Vice President. The action scenes are straightforward while the dialogue scenes are sometimes too cute for their own good. Die-hard 'Red' graphic novel aficionados may not appreciate this light-hearted approach. The graphic novel emphasized grim action without humor. Ellis has written about the film, 'So, yes, RED the film is very different. Not least because it needed to generate more material than the book itself actually constituted.' Schwentke and company have added new characters and fleshed out the plot. No, head CIA honcho Michael Beesley is not the chief villain. Moreover, Beesley's character never appears. Bruce Willis surrounds himself with several other spies to do what he would have done single-handed in the past. Mind you, 'Red' surpasses both earlier Willis outings 'Cop Out' and 'Surrogates.' No, it doesn't top 'Live Free or Die Hard.' Retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis of 'Die Hard') loves to flirt on the phone with customer service agent Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker of 'Weeds'), a Kansas City gal who wants to see the world. Basically, Frank tells her he isn't receiving his pension checks and uses this as pretext to chat. One night the CIA shows up with guns blazing, and our indestructible hero takes them out with extreme prejudice. Leaving Cleveland, Frank rushes to Kansas City to protect an initially reluctant Sarah who doesn't want to accompany him. Frank knows the CIA has tapped his phone and that the CIA would probably kill Sarah. While all this is transpiring, CIA Agent William Cooper (Karl Urban of 'Star Trek') is ordered by his superior Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon of 'Heist') to terminate Frank Moses. Meantime, Frank and Sarah scoot to New Orleans to pick up Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman of 'Unforgiven') and they learn from Joe that the hit team that tried to eliminate Frank murdered an investigative journalist writing an expose piece. Our hero and heroine find a list of names, including Frank's name, and ponder its mysterious significance. Next, Frank and Sarah recruit paranoid conspiracy theorist Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich of 'Con-Air'), who believes Frank is out to kill him. Marvin is so paranoid he has built a large, above-ground house to serve as a distraction for anybody who comes gunning for him.Meanwhile, he invites Frank and Sarah to join him in his underground house. Marvin raises the hood on an old rusty automobile, and they clamber inside, only to descend on stairs to his subterranean residence. Marvin examines the list and points out that everybody on the list participated in a covert operation in Guatemala. They contact one of the guys on the list, Gabriel Singer (James Remar of 'The Warriors'), and no sooner do they meet Gabriel than the CIA assassinates him. Frank isn't satisfied with what little that he knows, so he approaches Soviet espionage agent Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox of 'The Glimmer Man') to furnish him with all the codes and faked identity cards so Sarah and he can break into the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Tom Cruise did this in 'Mission: Impossible,' but 'Red' doesn't drum up any white-knuckled suspense. Frank masquerades as an army general to obtain the actual records of the Guatemalan incident. Naturally, as in 'Mission: Impossible,' our heroes set a fire to cover their escape and take advantage of a firefighter to slip past the villains. Frank tangles with Cooper during his foray at the agency and catches a bullet in the shoulder. Marvin takes our wounded hero to see Victoria (Helen Mirren of 'The Queen') and she fixes him up in a jiffy and then signs on with them. Eventually, our heroes learn that Vice President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon of 'Nip/Tuck') wiped out an entire village in Guatemala when he was soldier. Frank and his men were dispatched to clean up debacle and now Stanton apparently wants them dead so they can tell no tales.Everybody looks like they had a blast making this silly shenanigan of a spy movie. Bruce Willis doesn't do anything that we haven't seen him do better in better movies. Willis' co-stars outshine him. Watching delicate Helen Mirren on a noisy machine gun strafing either a limo or a group of gunmen is hoot. John Malkovich has the best role as a crazy agent who totes around a stuffed pink pig. Morgan Freeman gets the short shrift, while Richard Dreyfuss plays the nefarious villain behind Stanton. Screen legend Ernst Borgnine of 'The Dirty Dozen' puts in a brief appearance as the man-in-charge of the CIA's records. Altogether, 'Red' emerges as the kind of movie that you should wait to rent on DVD or Blu-Ray.",5,13,24,18 October 2010
Final Destination," Tongue In Shriek Fun!!!
","Watching horror movies a lot is like landing a plane. Any landing that you survive is a good one. Any horror movie that can scare the grits out of you is good, too. Sure, you may feel embarrassed after you recover from either a false alarm or a dreadful fright, but the filmmakers managed to grip you by her fears and generate adrenalin. Now, the acid test for a genuinely good horror flick is whether the storyline is strong enough to maintain momentum during the expository lulls between the scary scenes. Director James Wong's creepy 'Final Destination' qualifies as an improbable but entertaining dead teenager movie with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until fade-out.Airline authorities remove a mixed bag of high school seniors bound for France from their ill-fated jetliner at the last minute when 17-year old Alex Browning (Devon Sawa of 'Idle Hands') has a premonition about their 747 blowing up after take-off. Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke of 'Stay Tuned'), one of the teachers riding escort, agrees to behind with these reprobates while her Parisian cohort shepherds the remainder of the class across the Atlantic Ocean. While airport security guards detain them in the lounge, Flight 180 ascends into the night skies and explodes into a blazing fireball, with no survivors! Typically, any movie with a protagonist that rescues a collection of characters from certain death would win not only their undying gratitude but also their lifelong loyalty. 'Final Destination' dispenses with such hackneyed histrionics. Instead, the people that Alex saved either hate his guts or have to stay away from him until their grief heals. Everybody but Clear Rivers (Ali Larter of 'American Outlaws'), a Gothic-looking gal whose dad died in a convenience store robbery and whose mom lost her marbles and abandoned her, takes a shine to the ostracized Alex. She knows that Alex has a gift for predicting the future, rather like Christopher Walken did in David Cronenberg's 'The Dead Zone' (1983). No matter how hard these survivors try to cheat Death in this suspenseful, nail-biting, supernatural horror chiller, the Grim Reaper reclaims them like lost luggage in the end.Feverishly, Alex struggles to discern a pattern so that he can cheat Death and save the lives of his friends. Somewhere between its smart-aleck cynicism and its mischievous mayhem, this variation on 'The Dead Zone' grapples with some high-flown philosophy. Can anybody cheat Death? Does the Grim Reaper work by some kind of design? 'Final Destination' thrives on melodramatic shocks and surprises as well as several elaborately staged Rube Goldberg death traps to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. Picture 'The Omen' movies cross-bred with a slasher saga, and you've got a fairly good idea what to expect from this outlandish but provocative thriller. Considering the credentials of freshman director James Wong, who co-wrote 'Final Destination' with scenarist Glen Morgan, it should come as no surprise that 'Final Destination' emerges as such an engrossing chiller. Wong and Morgan both worked on many of the most memorable 'X-Files' episodes and it shows in 'Final Destination.'",8,0,1,31 May 2008
The Purge," A Wicked, High-Concept Satire About A Futuristic America
","Writer & director James DeMonaco's home invasion thriller 'The Purge' qualifies as both suspenseful and thought-provoking political allegory. The year is 2022, and America revels in a state of idyllic, economic prosperity. Crime rates as well as unemployment have plunged drastically under the inspired political leadership of the New Founding Fathers. Literally, America has been 'reborn.' The reason behind our national recovery is the institution of an event christened 'The Purge.' Citizens may embark on crime sprees during one 12-hour period annually without fear of prosecution. All emergency services, including police, firefighters, and physicians, are suspended. Indeed, anybody can murder with impunity. During the opening credits, we're shown ersatz surveillance system videos of people committing blue-collar crimes during the purge. The hypothetical nature of DeMonaco's narrative comes with some vague rules. We learn from the prologue that no harm must befall high-ranking government officials and citizens cannot wield weapons above a 'Class 4' level. The crazies that lay siege to our hero's house are packing either shotguns, assault weapons, or good, old-fashioned axes. DeMonaco provides scant details behind the ideology of the New Founding Fathers. People like to cleanse themselves on 'Purge' of their negative emotions and they praise their victims for sacrificing their lives for their country. Furthermore, he keeps the scope of his premise confined to one high-income, gated community covered with security systems. Clocking in at a nimble 85-minutes, 'The Purge' suffers more from its enigmatic origins than from plausibility. DeMonaco references the New Founding Fathers, but we don't learn much about them. You may see some things coming, but this evocative melodrama has enough surprises to keep you guessing. 'The Purge' carries an R-rating so the squeamish should beware, and adults with impressionable children should shun this violent, bloody thriller.James Sandin (Ethan Hawke of 'Training Day') sells security systems, and he has attained the pinnacle of success at his company with his chartbuster sales. Undoubtedly, the annual Purges have contributed in some small measure to his good fortune. He resides in an upscale community with his wife Mary (Lena Headey of 'Game of Thrones') and their two children, 14-year old Charlie (Max Burkholder of 'Daddy Day Care') and 16-year old Zoey (Adelaide Kane of 'Donner Pass'), and they live in reasonable harmony. If anybody can shatter the tranquility of the Sandin house, Zoey's 18-year old boyfriend, Henry (Tony Oller of 'Beneath the Darkness'), who doesn't stand a ghost of a chance negotiating with her dad, is the best candidate. As the action unfolds, ubiquitous loudspeakers repeatedly warn citizens that the next 'Purge' is scheduled to commence at 7 PM and then elapse 12 hours later. DeMonaco makes certain that we know what the Purge is, even if we don't know the gritty details behind it. Meanwhile, Henry wants to win James over to his side. Henry plans to let events trap him inside the Sandin household for the next 12 hours. While he is holed up with the Sandins, Henry hopes to convert Zoey's father to his camp. Initially, nobody but Zoey is aware of Henry's presence. During the pre-Purge period, James and Mary deal with some of their neighbors who are preparing for an active evening of bloodletting. DeMonaco does a good job of foreshadowing their part in the action. Meantime, James isn't too concerned with all the mayhem that will ensue at seven. He locks down his house with his state-of-the-art security system that makes the dwelling well-nigh impregnable. Ordinary burglars wouldn't be able to breach this system. Moreover, the system is equipped with surveillance cameras that enable the Sandins to monitor everything occurring around them. They celebrate the occasion with a dinner, but Zoey isn't acting civil during this preamble. Charlie is a bit of a home security whiz himself; he has built the equivalent of 'Demonic Toys' doll that cruises around in a small, four-wheeled, remote-control contraption. Not long after lockdown, Charlie spots a homeless African-American (Edwin Hodge of 'Red Dawn') in fatigues wandering through the neighborhood. We aren't told how he got into the gated community. This stranger pleads desperately for mercy because he is the object of a manhunt. James' considerate son decides to forfeit everybody's safety and disarms the security system so the stranger can enjoy sanctuary. Of course, something has to shatter the calm in the Sandin household or 'The Purge' wouldn't land the Sandins in the dire straits that follow. Before the night is over, nothing promises to be the same for the Sandins. Not long after they let the African-American into their home, a collection of male and female killers dressed in gaudy costumes with hatchets and high-powered rifles show up on their doorstep. Guess who they want and what they will do to get him?The performances are strong. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey make a convincing couple, while Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane are just as persuasive as their kids. The assailants who surround the Sandin residence are a creepy-looking bunch with their masks and costumes. 'The Purge' is cut from the same cloth as movies like 'The Hunger Games,' 'Panic Room,' 'Straw Dogs,' 'A Clockwork Orange,' 'The Strangers,' 'Lakeview Terrace,' and 'Assault on Precinct 13.' Incidentally, not only did Ethan Hawke star in the remake of 'Assault on Precinct 13,' but also James DeMonaco penned the script. The biggest problem with DeMonaco's script is the reason the villains target the Sandin estate. You'd think that James would keep closer tabs on his son. The real surprises occur late in the third act after the villains have stormed the house. At one point, you may find yourself screaming back at the screen for our heroes to kill, kill, kill! Clearly, what DeMonaco has written is not as cynical as it seems. Although 'The Purge' looks like something the NRA would endorse, you can bet that DeMonaco has crafted a satire to show how extreme the conditions would get to achieve such fascist prosperity.",8,21,40,9 June 2013
Pitch Perfect," Amusing but Far from Perfect
","The musical comedy 'Pitch Perfect' qualifies as an entertaining but uneven comedy. Freshman director Jason Moore and scenarist Kay Cannon have adapted Mickey Rapkin's book about a behind-the-scenes world of competitive collegiate a cappella. Although it boasts an attractive cast with sympathetic, multi-cultural underdog characters galore and a genuine bitch villainess, this PG-13 laffer about an all girl college a cappella group and their antics struggles to be sincere and silly at the same time. Primarily, 'Pitch Perfect' is silly. The Barden Bellas are a hard-luck gal group who enter vocal competitions but suffer because they sing old-fashioned songs. Worse, one of their founding members has brought them no end of bad publicity because she projectile vomited into the crowd during a competition. This is part of the problem with 'Pitch Perfect.' What turns out to be an ostensibly pleasant, engaging comedy is marred by some boorish humor. The projectile vomiting is hilarious in an outrageous sort of way, but it doesn't blend well with our protagonist's antics with her girl group or a fellow radio station intern. Some of the sight gags are funny, like Baloney Barbara. The other problem is the lackluster romance between beautiful Anna Kendrick and a woefully miscast but nice Skylar Austin. They don't generate any sparks. The musical selections and the vocals are terrific, and 'Pitch Perfect' looks polished in every area. The heroine, Beca (Anna Kendrick of 'Twilight'), tolerates attending class at an all girl's college. She would rather be in sunny California in the music production business, honing her skills and paying her dues as a disc jockey. Beca's annoying father, Dr. Mitchell (John Hickey of 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'), who teaches Comparative Literature, convinces his daughter to give college a try. If she doesn't like college, Mitchell promises to foot the bill for her to go to the West Coast. During move-in day, Beca encounters a warbling fellow in a car, Jesse (Skylar Austin of 'Hamlet 2'), and it is love at first sight for him. Later, after she has moved in with a weird Asian roommate who wants nothing to do with her, Beca heads off to the shower. Earlier, she had conversed with Chloe (Brittany Snow of 'Hairspray') and Aubrey (Anna Camp of 'The Help') about joining the Bellas, but she assured them that she couldn't sing. Chloe hears Beca in the shower, confronts her, and persuades her to join their group. Along the way, Beca stumbles over Jesse who has joined the prestigious Treblemakers, a collegiate a cappella group, and they start seeing each other. Jesse turns Beca into a movie lover.This entertaining romp has some good scenes and some not-so-good scenes.",8,0,2,12 January 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," An Incendiary Sequel of Epic Proportions
","An incendiary sequel of epic proportions, 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' surpasses its pugnacious predecessor in a bonfire of startling plot shenanigans, compelling new characters, and spectacularly outlandish heroics. Enthusiasts of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy about archer exemplar Katniss Everdeen in a dystopian science fiction future where fascism has usurped freedom will be the only ones who won't be surprised by the blaze of melodramatic revelations. Nevertheless, judging by their approval, Collins' fan base is largely content with the filmmakers' loyalty to the source material. Presumably, the author's work as an executive producer ensured this heightened sense of fidelity. 'Constantine' director Francis Lawrence, 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenarist Simon Beaufoy and 'Little Miss Sunshine' scribe Michael Arndt have altered as little as possible in their big-screen adaptation. Meantime, 'Catching Fire' qualifies as a lavish cinematic treat for the eyes with an enormous $130 million budget that eclipses the first film's meager $78 million budget. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutchinson, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Liam Hemsworth, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland reprise their roles with renewed relish, while Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and Sam Claflin provide fresh faces for the franchise. 'Catching Fire' opens shortly after the original ended. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence of 'X-Men: First Class') and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson of 'Red Dawn') survived the 74th annual Hunger Games despite a last minute rule change and emerged as the triumphant tributes. Safely back in their Appalachia birthplace of District 12, our heroine finds herself face-to-face in the same room with despotic President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland of 'The Eagle Has Landed') who is far from pleased with Katniss' poisoned berry bluff. Indeed, Snow is quite glacial about the outcome. Mind you, he compelled head games maker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) to dine on the same berries near the end of the first film. Meantime, Katniss and Peeta embark on a mandatory victory tour of the other eleven Districts with their chaperones, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson of 'Zombieland') and the bewigged Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks of 'Man on a Ledge'), at their sides. In District 11, which dispatched 12-year old Rue, Katniss expresses her sorrow at her friend's demise. Katniss' sympathy ignites a riot, and the Peacekeepers, in their white body armor, snatch the spectator who sparked the unrest and kill him execution style with a bullet to the back of his head. Remember, this post-apocalyptic science fiction saga occurs in the remnants of America. Following the catastrophic 'Dark Days' civil war, America has arisen from the ashes as the tyrannical kingdom of Panem. All power radiates from the Capitol, an ornate metropolis secluded somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. The architecture of this stronghold is reminiscent of the headquarters of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and Ancient Rome. Panem serves as the name for this dictatorial regime, and the despots draw on the Latin catchphrase panem et circenses which means 'bread and circuses.' Essentially, Panem has created blood-sport games similar to the Roman gladiatorial bouts that unfold in a surreal arena where opponents battle to the death on an annual basis. A male and female tribute between ages 12 through 18 are selected from each of the twelve Districts to participate in this kill-or-be-killed death match. Unlike a conventional game where the action might lose its urgency, the games maker can conjure up obstacles that don't exist in the real worth to perk up the proceedings. They can either tamper with the weather or summon predatory creatures to keep the action interesting to audiences. Every time a tribute dies, a cannon blast erupts and an image of the deceased tribute illuminates the heavens. In 'Catching Fire,' things have gotten worse. No matter where Katniss and Peeta travel, they witness widespread discontent, and Snow is seething with rage. He wants to execute Katniss, but new games maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman of 'Doubt') assures him that Katniss can still serve the state in her capacity as a tribute. Rather than organize another Hunger Games with amateurs, Snow announces a Quarter Quell. Basically, this special version of the Games occurs every 25 years. Quarter Quell tributes are chosen from the victors of previous games. Meaning, these combatants aren't amateurs. They are survivors who killed and know how to kill. In District 12, Katniss is selected again, but former victor Haymitch is chosen over Peeta. Similarly as Katniss did in 'The Hunger Games' when she substituted herself for her younger sister Primrose, Peeta substitutes himself for Haymitch, and our hero and heroine find themselves confronting considerably stiffer competition.Like its predecessor, 'Catching Fire' clocks in just short of two-and-a-half-hours, but this sprawling saga never wears out its welcome. The villains ride roughshod over the heroes during a grim first hour that will challenge your patience. Then again, when the new games commence and the considerably ramped up combatants appear, 'Catching Fire' rages like a four-alarm inferno. The scenes boasting savage Baboons are as memorable as Katniss' ability to shoot arrows. The obstacles that our heroes face are daunting. Unlike most movies of this kind, you need not linger for any extra scenes after the end credits unless you want to know that it was lensed on location in Atlanta, Georgia; Oakland, New Jersey; O'ahu, Hawaii, and Los Angeles, California.",10,0,19,7 December 2013
The Matrix," Cyberescapism Galore!!!
","Co-directors Andy and Larry (now Lana) Wachowski fashioned one of the most revolutionary science fiction sagas of all time with the cyberspace thriller 'The Matrix' with Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss, and Hugo Weaving. The first of a trilogy, this 136-minute, allegorical actioneer pits a group of resistance fighters led by Neo and Trinity against the status quo villainy of 21st century henchmen who wear suits and ties with sunglasses. The pioneering 'bullet time' cinematography is as incredible as the action is audacious. Nothing is what it appears to be in 'The Matrix.' The Wachowskis have appropriated a little bit of everything for their derivative but striking cyberescapism. They have incorporated philosophy, martial arts combat, Greek mythology, Biblical themes, and ideas from movies such as 'Strange Days' and 'Dark City.' Legendary martial arts choreographer Woo-ping Yuen has staged some kinetic gravity-defying, close-quarters combat sequences. Carrie Ann-Moss never made another movie that matched 'The Matrix.' The first scene when she runs up walls to elude the police, bounds across rooftops, and hurls herself like Peter Pan over a street is sensational. This computer generated scene gets the action off to a dynamic start and the Wachowskis never let the pace lag even when things get a little convoluted. Laurence Fishburne behaves like John the Baptist from the Bible, and Hugo Weaving makes a diabolical villain. 'The Matrix' belongs in the top 100 science fiction films of all time.",10,0,2,24 September 2013
Godzilla," Breathes New Fire Into An Old Franchise
","Believe it or not, although the Japanese made their landmark monster movie 'Godzilla' in 1954, Hollywood beat them to the punch with 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.' Adapted from a Ray Bradbury short story published in 'The Saturday Evening Post' magazine, 'Beast' concerned a prodigious prehistoric amphibian awakened from hibernation by atomic bomb blasts. Wasting no time, the scaly leviathan wended its way to New York City where it wrecked havoc on a heretofore unparalleled scale. Even before 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms,' Hollywood had made a 1925 silent-era movie 'The Lost World' where a dinosaur on the loose rampaged through London. Anyway, about a year after 'Beast' came out, the Japanese released 'Gojira,' and the Toho Company went on to exploit its radioactive creature for every cent it was worth. Godzilla stomped Tokyo to smithereens, and the film proved so profitable that Hollywood reedited it to accommodate American actors and changed the title from 'Gojira' to 'Godzilla.' Afterward, Hollywood entrusted the gigantic monster genre to the Japanese. Meantime, Toho has churned out at least 28 Godzilla epics over a 60-year period and coined millions at the box office with their man in a rubber suit. Eventually, rival Japanese studios produced Godzilla knock-offs; the chief example was the titanic turtle 'Gamera' that breathed fire.In 1998, 'Independence Day' director Roland Emmerich helmed the first American 'Godzilla,' but it took too many liberties with the Toho legend. First, Big G lost his incendiary breath. Second, Big G resembled a Komodo dragon. Comparably, 'Godzilla' (1998) sold only half as many tickets during its opening weekend as 'Monster' British director Gareth Edwards' ambitious, second American reboot of Big G. Unlike Emmerich's 'Godzilla' that synthesized spectacle and slapstick, Edwards and 'Seventh Son' scenarist Max Borenstein have shunned humor in favor of catastrophe. The new 'Godzilla' doesn't involve lame-brained amateurs, but grim-faced scientific and military types. Indeed, this 'Godzilla' treats the Toho icon with genuine respect and dignity. This time around Godzilla isn't searching for someplace to lay its eggs. Instead, Big G has embarked on its own crusade to defend mankind and thwart a couple of nuclear-age behemoths that want to lay their eggs in San Francisco. Ironically, Big G wins the battle of the monsters, but he doesn't garner as much stomp time as he did in Emmerich's 'Godzilla.' You'll have to wait patiently about an hour for Big G to show up. Nevertheless, Godzilla makes a dramatic entrance, and he dominates the action for the last half-hour. Edwards' straight-forward version of 'Godzilla' eclipses Emmerich's comic version.Most of the amusing 'Godzilla' movies from the 1960s & 1970s pitted Big G against two enemies, and the new 'Godzilla' adopts the scenario of the outnumbered hero. The battle scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) are thoroughly invigorating. Unfortunately, the two biggest drawbacks to Edwards' largely entertaining 'Godzilla' are its dreary, one-dimensional humans who clutter up the action and the bland MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) monsters that resemble gargantuan mosquitoes that walk on their knuckles like gorillas. A cast of familiar faces cannot compensate for their sketchy characters. Mankind isn't half as interesting as Godzilla, especially when he tangles with the MUTOs in a world class smack-down brawl. Ironically, Big G appears to get the short shrift. 'Godzilla' isn't so much about the monsters as the spectacular collateral damage that Godzilla and two airborne giants wreck on mankind. The destruction, or perhaps urban renewal, matches the wholesale mayhem of the 'Transformers' trilogy and Marvel's 'The Avengers.' Traditionally, filmmakers have employed Godzilla as allegory for the appalling consequences mankind has paid for tampering with our environment. Essentially, Godzilla has always been the cultural embodiment of global warming.The action unfolds in 1954 when the military detonates atomic devices at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in a futile effort to destroy Godzilla. We catch a glimpse of Big-G's heavily spiked back emerging from the depths as the explosions erupt. Later, a nuclear power plant in Japan collapses, and the radioactive ruins become the equivalent of Area 51. Janjira Plant Supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston of 'Drive') watches in horror as his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche of 'The English Patient') dies when the reactor blows up. Afterward, the government quarantines the collapsed plant, but Brody suspects the government is orchestrating a cover-up. Meantime, Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of 'Savages') grows up, joins the Navy, and specializes in explosive ordnance disposal. He marries Elle (Elizabeth Olsen of 'Oldboy') who works as nurse in San Francisco. Naturally, they have a son Sam (Carson Bolde). Fifteen years after the Janjira disaster, Joe hasn't recanted his crazy theories about a cover-up. The authorities arrest him for trespassing in his old home in the quarantine zone. They escort him to meet two scientists, Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Graham (Sally Hawkins), who have established a secret facility within the Janjira ruins. All hell breaks loose a second time, and a colossal, winged reptile materializes.The last thing director Gareth Edwards had on his mind for his 'Godzilla' reboot was levity. Not only does he want us to take Godzilla seriously as a monster, but he also wants us to take the movie 'Godzilla' seriously. The new 'Godzilla' shares little in common with the-man-in-a-rubber-suit 'Godzilla' franchise. If you haven't seen either 'Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla' (1994) or 'Godzilla vs. Megalon' (1973), you haven't seen some of the best 'Godzilla' entries that challenge your suspension of disbelief. Edwards draws on Steven Spielberg's movies 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters of a Third Kind' as models for both the presentation and the pacing of his impressive two hour plus CGI monstrosity. The visual effects make everything appear believable. The spectacle of destruction in Japan, Hawaii, Las Vegas and San Francisco is stunning. Altogether, Edward's 'Godzilla' breathes new fire into a old franchise.",8,3,8,26 May 2014
Looper," 'Looper' Is A Pooper!!!
","'Looper' qualifies as a sordid science fiction thriller about time travel with an awful ending. Stir a little H.G. Wells in with some Stephen King and add a pinch of 'The Sopranos,' and you've got the basics of 'Brick' director Rian Johnson's contrived, unconvincing chronicle. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are cast as one in the same character in this disappointing actioneer that pits them against each other with a no-win outcome. Furthermore, both protagonists emerge as more anti-heroic than heroic. If you dismiss the fact these talented thespians bear scant resemblance to each other, you must still consider the scarcity of information about a distant future as well as a warped premise. These shortcomings constitute the chief flaws in this imaginative but predictable sci-fi saga that unfolds in an erratic manner, lacks quotable dialogue, and features one character with no qualms about shooting innocent adolescents. By the time this uninspired, R-rated, 118-minute, spectacle has worn out its welcome; you have no reason to care about anybody, including an obnoxious telekinetic tyke who doesn't know when to keep his trap shut. Mind you, the future has never appeared more dystopian. Some people are born with a mutation that enables them to levitate objects, and these fellows find that they can lure facile-minded babes into bed by making quarters float above the palms of their hands. The economy has hit bottom, and vagrancy has become epidemic. Citizens can execute vagrants on the spot if they feel so inclined. Any time Hollywood undertakes a time travel tale, the filmmakers conjure up some of the ugliest vehicles. While the cars and trucks look hopelessly tacky, the motorcycles resemble something Luke Skywalker might ride. Basically, you see a guy straddling a cylinder with handle bars. Computer-generated special effects blur everything beneath his feet so he appears to be cruising on a cushion of air.Johnson's screenplay is as amoral as his narrative premise is warped. Imitating the best Mafia movies of director Martin Scorsese, Johnson relies on the voice-over narration of his lead character to acquaint us not only with his unusual profession but also with the seedy world in which he thrives. Kansas in the year 2044 serves as the setting. Presumably, Johnson is making an ironic 'Wizard of Oz' joke with his futuristic fable. The premise of 'Looper' is that a guy can live the high life by killing individuals from the future who have been sent back to the past. Joseph Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt of 'The Dark Knight Rises') is a killer who was brought up the ranks by his boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels of 'Blood Work'), to do his dirty work. Actually, Abe was beamed back from the future to coordinate the equivalent of Murder Incorporated. In the 1940s, the Mafia relied on out-of-town gunmen from to ice enemies on their own turf. For example, if the New York Mafia wanted to dispose of an adversary, they contracted a Chicago gunsel to eliminate him. The rationale was that the authorities always sought a motive. What motive would a Chicago mobster have for killing New York mobster that he didn't know? This remained standard operating procedure until the authorities figured out the connection. Mobsters in the year 2074 cannot murder their adversaries because humans have become too easy to track. Since the mob cannot kill their own, they contract hits out to mobsters from the past. Gunman designated 'loopers' kill and dispose of these victims that the mob has beamed back so nobody can find them. Our hero wields an exotic shotgun called a 'blunderbuss,' and the looper waits near a cornfield in the middle of nowhere with his weapon and a tarp spread on the ground. Eventually, a bound man with a bag over his head and silver ingots strapped to his back materializes. After he murders his prey, Joseph incinerates him so no traces remain. When a gangland assassin in the future has worn out his welcome, however, the mob sends him back to the past so he can kill himself. They call this 'closing the loop.' After Young Joe botches the job of killing Old Joe, he has to dodge the bullets of his former associates—known as 'gat-men'--until he can corner and kill himself. Losing one's older self is referred to as 'letting his loop run.' Joe's quick-witted alter-ego from the future (Bruce Willis of 'Twelve Monkeys') escapes and searches for a mysterious person known only as the 'Rainmaker.' This enigmatic individual wants to eradicate any trace of the loopers. Older Joe has been given a map with three possible addresses for this 'Rainmaker.' Joe wants to wreak vengeance on the 'Rainmaker' because the ladder dispatched trigger-happy gunmen who accidentally murdered his Asian wife. Instead of keeping things simple, Johnson complicates matters with a subplot about a kid with telekinetic powers. Cid (Pierce Gagnon of 'The Crazies') lives on a sugar cane farm with his mom, Sara (Emily Blunt of 'The Adjustment Bureau'), who runs the place by herself. One of the locations that the Old Joe has is Sara's farm. He suspects Cid may be the reason that assassins are knocking themselves off. Essentially, what we have here is a good assassin and a bad assassin who share the same body from drastically different decades. Young Joe stakes out Sara's farm so he can terminate Old Joe with extreme prejudice. This uneven, high body count stinker doesn't flow well and is often confusing, too. Moreover, the logic is questionable. Wouldn't it be easier for the future mob to kill their enemies and send the remains back to the past for disposal? Furthermore, what would happen if the victim that they sent back managed to escape like Old Joe and gum up the works? In most movies, you look for a character that you can either love or envy. Nobody is lovable in 'Looper' and parts of this movie are just plain downright dull.",1,98,194,28 September 2012
Heat," One of the Best Crime Thrillers Ever Made!!!
","'Miami Vice' creator Michael Mann made one of the best heist thrillers of all time with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. 'Heat' pits a seasoned LAPD detective against a hardened criminal in an intelligent but exciting cat & mouse crime epic that considers the public and private aspects of the lives of the heroes and the villains. Indeed, we get to see how the cop lives after hours and how the criminal survives when he isn't committing crime. Clocking in at 172 minutes, 'Heat' blazes up more often than not when it isn't smoldering with suspense. Pacino and De Niro make terrific adversaries, while Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ted Levine, Wes Studi, and Kevin Gage round out a first-class supporting cast. Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman, and Ashley Judd play the romantic interests respectively for Pacino, De Niro, and Kilmer. Of course, if Mann had left out the soap operatic elements, 'Heat' would have been even better. Basically, Pacino and De Niro are at each other's throats for most of the 172 minutes, and they have one scene together in a diner where they read each other the riot act about what they will be compelled to do if they encounter one other in the line of duty. The De Niro character has a great line involving 30 seconds when you know everything will change. A shady entrepreneur William Fichtner takes up about a third of the action in a subplot that grows out of the armored car robbery at the outside. The way that De Niro and company knock over the armored car company is flat out neat. They ram the armored car with a huge tow truck. Everything looks authentic in this urban western. The bank robbery and shoot-out in the streets of L.A. is choreographed beautifully with most of the cops armed with automatic weapons. The big finale at LAX reminded me of the conclusion to 'Bullitt' when Stever McQueen ventured out onto the airport runaway to catch a killer. Elliot Goldenthal furnishes Mann an orchestral score that underlines the tension, suspense, and heartache in the narrative. Lenser Dante Spinotti makes everything look larger-than-life and gritty.",10,0,3,8 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Film That Gave Sci-Fi Fantasy Films A Makeover
","Writer & director George Lucas didn't invent science fiction as a film genre, but his landmark film 'Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope' and its sequels and spin-offs certainly propelled science-fiction from the fringe to A-class productions. What made 'Star Wars' so charismatic is the hokum that it embraces with such consummate love. Lucas has attributed his inspiration for the 'Star Wars' franchise to his memories of Saturday matinée serial cliffhangers as well as his fascination with mythology. Mind you, nothing in the 'Star Wars' franchise is remotely original except for its reliance on hoary clichés and conventions that fuel the 'space-as-an-adventure' formula with exotic worlds, lethal aliens, and ravishing damsels-in-distress. Basically, Luke Skywalker is another embodiment of 'Flash Gordon' and Darth Vader is a riff on Ming the Merciless. Harrison Ford's Han Solo may be an outer space smuggler in a fast ship, but he resembles an old frontier western gunslinger for hire to the highest bidder. Alec Guinness is the older gunman/samurai warrior with a strange mind-set that enables him to control weaker minds. Robots and droids emerge as memorable characters, too. Surely, Darth Vader with his long flowing black robes, respirator breathing vocal deliver, and unmistakably Nazi-style helmet qualifies as one of the top twenty all-time evil villains. Lucas contrives weird aliens and animals and populates his film with a number of visually interesting settings. The Death Star as the ultimate weapon is really cool and presents the ultimate challenge to our heroes because they must destroy it. Essentially, the Death Star is comparable to the eponymous 'Guns of Navarone.' There is a lot of sophistication wrapped up in this seemingly superficial saga about a galactic rebellion against tyranny.",9,0,0,2 October 2010
Deadpool," Marvel Movies Will Never Be The Same!!!
","I've seen 'Deadpool' four times, and I could watch it another four times. Freshman director Tim Miller, 'Zombieland' scenarists Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, along with funny man Ryan Reynolds have forged a Marvel superhero origin epic like none you've ever seen. If you've got a skewered, perhaps even morbid, sense of humor, you may enjoy this swiftly-paced, slickly-made, scrambled-up saga about a guy who shares something in common with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine of 'X-Men' fame. Mind you, Deadpool is not a run-of-the-mill superhero with role model potential. He has a foul mouth, a perverse sense of humor, and his body heals itself rather quickly, because--like his fellow X-Men, he is a mutant. He wears a red, Spider-man style hood with patches over his eyes. Everything about 'Deadpool' qualifies as not only refreshing but also uproarious. 'Deadpool' slaughters sacred cows. Instead of the typical opening credits that identify the actors and technicians behind the scenes, we see brief descriptions. For example, director Tim Miller, who has only made two short films, is referred to as 'An Overpaid Tool.' Deadpool jokes about others: '127 Hours,' Liam Neeson's 'Taken' trilogy, and the 'X-Men' franchise. Twentieth Century Fox owns both 'Deadpool' and 'X-Men,' so they can get away with poking fun at their own properties. Ryan Reynolds ridicules himself, too. The former 'Green Lantern' star cracks jokes about shunning a green superhero suit after he submits himself to a passel of unscrupulous people to cure him of multiple forms of cancer. Furthermore, he entreats them not to make the superhero suit animated like the 'Green Lantern' superhero suit. I thought 'Green Lantern' was tolerable, but I hated the CGI villain. Meantime, despite its predictable, formulaic narrative, 'Deadpool' suffers from little else. Reynolds was born to play Wade Williams. Let's not forget Reynolds played a milder incarnation of Deadpool in 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine.' The 'Deadpool' character dishes up deliciously funny lines. As much as I would love to quote those clever quips, the profanity in them prohibits me, so you'll have to hear them for yourself. Deadpool is loquacious to a fault, but everything he utters is hilarious. Comparatively, the villain gets in only one clever line. A lot of moviegoers are going to be quoting 'Deadpool,' and some of those witticisms may eventually wind up in everyday conversation.Now, let me pause and provide a pithy plot synopsis before I resume my praise in the third paragraph. Wade Williams (Ryan Reynolds of 'R.I.P.D.') is a former Special Forces Commando with 41 confirmed kills to his record. He lives in New York City and hires himself out to resolve other people's problems kind of like a sort of 'Equalizer.' Wade discourages a pizza delivery man, Jeremy (Style Dayne of 'Words and Pictures') from stalking a girl. When he isn't working, Wade hangs out with other low-life mercenaries at an obscure bar--Sister Margaret's Home for Wayward Girls-- run by his best friend, Weasel (comedian T. J. Miller of 'Our Idiot Brother'), who doubles as the bartender. Later, he meets a girl at a bar, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin of 'Serenity'), who works as a server at a strip club, and they realize that they are made for each other. They share a similar sense of humor, enjoy kinky sex, and seem inseparable until Wade collapses mysteriously. Afterward, they learn to their horror that Wade is afflicted with terminal cancer. No sooner has Wade been diagnosed than a well-dressed little guy in a suit and tie (Jed Rees of 'Galaxy Quest') approaches him with a business card and an alternative form of medical treatment that will enable him to survive and emerge as better than better. Wade accepts this nebulous offer against Vanessa's wishes. At the clinic, our hero encounters two unsavory characters, a tall, shady gent posing as a doctor, Ajax (Ed Skrien of 'The Transporter Refueled'), and his female assistant, Angel Dust (Gina Carano of 'Haywire'), who looks like a linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys. Ajax explains that they will expose Wade to a cocktail of serums and torturous treatments that will prompt his mutant powers to appear and destroy his cancer. Of course, they cherish no such illusions about helping Wade out. Miraculously, the treatment succeeds in curing Wade, and he emerges from this hideous obstacle course of treatments as literally indestructible. The downside is that he looks just as hideous. He looks like a walking, talking pizza with a shaven head, but he is incredibly strong, resilient, and heals in light seconds after succumbing to the worse wounds. Eventually, he adopts a suit to conceal his hideous appearance and searches for Ajax so that the dastard can help him recover his good looks.If you walk into 'Deadpool' expecting to see 'X-Men,' 'Captain America,' 'Iron Man,' or 'Thor,' you're going to be severely surprised. Indeed, 'Deadpool' inhabits that outlandish universe, but director Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds have concocted a subversive saga that is not only R-rated but also not suitable for teenagers. The montage of pansexual practices that Wade and Vanessa indulge in may alienate prudish spectators, and Wade rhapsodizes about the joys of masturbation. After he makes the transition to indestructible, Wade tracks down evil Ajax and kills each of the villain's accomplices when they fail to inform on him. Now, we're talking body count galore with Deadpool slicing up his many adversaries when he isn't riddling them with gunfire. You can take your kids 'Captain America' and 'Batman,' but you should draw the line at 'Deadpool' or they will be asking you interesting questions that may challenge your responses. Ryan Reynolds was made to play 'Deadpool' and Ed Skrien as 'the British villain' is truly heinous. Naturally, Deadpool's girlfriend Vanessa is a damsel-in-distress, but there is nothing remotely innocent about this dame with a tattoo on her breast. T.J. Miller has some of the best lines in 'Deadpool' that discretion prevents me from quoting. After 'Deadpool,' superhero movies will never be the same!",10,4,15,22 February 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Not Very Funny
","They should have called this movie 'My Favorite Rock Star' because 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' director Nicholas Stoller scenarist Jason Segel look like the Peter O'Toole comedy 'My Favorite Year' inspired them. Pinnacle Record President Sergio Roma (Sean Combs) is searching for a surefire hit to keep his brood of kids in Air Jordans when an intern Aaron Green (Jonah Hill of 'Super Bad') suggest that they stage a comeback concert at the Greek Theater for washed up British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall')whose career tanked after he produced an album called 'African Child.' Sergio packs Aaron off on a trans-Atlantic flight to London to pick up Snow and bring him back in 72 hours. Meanwhile, Aaron and his live-in girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss of 'Did You Hear About the Morgans?') are having relationship woes. She is a hospital intern who is worked so hard that she doesn't get to spend much time with Aaron. She finds a job in Seattle that would give them more time together, but it would force Aaron to look for a new job. They decide to break up and Aaron flies off to England. Of course, the comedy here is that Aldous is a drugged-out rock & roller who cannot get enough booze and narcotics into his system while straight-laced Aaron does his best to keep him off drugs and get him onto the plane. The irony is that Aaron eventually winds up doing all of Aldous's narcotics. At one point, Aaron has to stuff a ball of heroin up his anus so that the two of them can slip past the airport checkers. Aaron discovers what it is like to be a free-wheeling, drugged out guy and gets laid once in a bathroom by a woman and later is raped by a drugged out Vegas chick called Destiny who stuffs a dildo up his butt while she straddles him in bed. Indeed, poor Aaron does virtually everything to nurse maid Aldous to the concert. The jokes are not that funny and the formulaic characters are far from sympathetic, despite the fact that Aldous redeems himself and Aaron becomes Aldous' producer. Incidentally, Aaron and Daphne hook back up and make it to Seattle. Sean Combs delivers one of the funniest performances and Colm Meaney of 'Con Air' isn't far behind him as Aldous' father Jonathan Snow. Kristen Bell appears in a cameo.",4,59,117,26 June 2010
Cloud Atlas," 'Cloud Atlas' is no 'Matrix!'
","'Cloud Atlas' qualifies as a pretentious philosophical potboiler. The premise of this lavish $100 million epic is that mankind is connected across the millennium in our pursuit of happiness. 'The Matrix' co-helmers Lana and Andy Wachowski along with 'Run Lola Run' director Tom Tykwer have bitten off more than they can contend with in their convoluted adaptation of bestselling British author David Mitchell's award-winning novel. The filmmakers argue that nobody resides in a vacuum, and everybody exerts an integral influence in the evolution of mankind. Everything amounts to an eternal loop. A defiant replicant, Sonmit-451, summarizes their collective ideology: 'Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future.' Touting a laudable liberal agenda and boasting an incomparable cast, this schizophrenic science fiction saga serves up six insipid B-movie plots which intertwine as they unfold in a disorienting daze. Each episode concerns three chief characters and depicts them battling an oppressive system that engages in some form of prejudice. Two visual threads tie these stories together. First, some characters share a comet-shaped birthmark. Second, all appear in multiple roles. The Wachowskis told 'The New Yorker' magazine that the actors represented migratory souls that evolve over time into a higher state of consciousness.The first story takes place in 19th century Hawaii. An American attorney, Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess of 'One Day'), purchases Maori slaves for his racist father-in-law. During his sojourn on the island, Ewing suspects he is being poisoned by Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks) who is treating him for parasitic worm. According to Dr. Goose, the worm is devouring Ewing's brain. Actually, Dr. Goose covets the key around Ewing's neck that will unlock a treasure chest. Meantime, Ewing has smuggled a slave, Autua (David Gyasi), aboard the sailing ship. The bond of friendship between them convinces the lawyer to become an abolitionist. During the 1930s, in Belgium, a destitute, young, gay musician, Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), works as an amanuensis for a cantankerous composer, Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent of 'Inkheart'), who is losing his memory. One of the books Frobisher reads at Ayrs' mansion is Adam Ewing's seafaring chronicle. Tempers flare up between Frobisher and Ayrs when the youth writes a symphony, the Cloud Atlas Sextet, which Ayrs claims as his own. Frobisher pulls a pistol on Ayrs, packs up his symphony, and goes into hiding. The action shifts to San Francisco in 1973. A crusading journalist, Luisa Rey (Hallie Berry), obtains a confidential report about a possible meltdown at a nuclear power plant. An assassin stalks not only Luisa but also Dr. Isaac Sachs (Tom Hanks) who acted as the whistle-blower. The next story occurs in contemporary London. An ill-fated book publisher, Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent), goes into hiding after some thugs threaten him about royalty payments. Timothy's brother Denholme (Hugh Grant) arranges sanctuary for him. Timothy discovers too late that Denholme has committed him to a retirement home that he cannot leave. In the next story, set in Neo Seoul in 2144, a genetically-engineered female fabricant, Sonmi~451 (Donna Bae of 'The Host'), who toils in a fast-food restaurant, participates in a revolution against an Orwellian corporatocracy. The final story takes place after a planetary apocalypse in 2346. Meronym (Hallie Berry), a survivor of a technologically-advanced society, persuades a superstitious goat herder Zachry (Tom Hanks) to guide her up a treacherous mountain to an outpost named Cloud Atlas, so she can transmit a message to humans who have abandoned Earth and reside on distant planets. Zachry and Meronym speak in a Pidgin English dialect that audiences may find difficult to decipher.The Wachowskis directed the Ewing chronicle and the two sci-fi sagas, while Tykwer helmed the episodes about the composer, the journalist and the publisher. They cross-cut erratically between these yarns so all six end up being one single story. One minute you're up to your neck in comedy, while the next minute you're plunged into a tragedy. The gimmick of casting actors in various roles doesn't always succeed. Indeed, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving, and Hugh Grant aren't convincing as Asian characters. Ultimately, some plots emerge as more entertaining. The slapstick Timothy Cavendish plot surpasses the serious, straightforward 'Blade Runner' plot about an insurrection in futuristic Korea. Part of the problem with 'Cloud Atlas' is that none of the characters is remotely charismatic, and the plots are pretty lackluster, particularly Adam Ewing's adventures. Neither the Wachoswkis nor Tykwer develop a palatable sense of either tension or suspense in these stories. Sadly, despite its lofty ambitions, this derivative 163-minute melodramatic marathon suffers because nothing about it constitutes a revelation.",6,7,20,2 November 2012
300," Chipendale Warriors Unite!
","Imagine the classic Homeric sword and shield epic 'Troy' (2004) with Brad Pitt crossed with the contemporary look of the Mickey Rourke/Jessica Alba neo-noir crime thriller 'Sin City' (2005), and you'll have a close idea about what 'Land of the Dead' director Zack Snyder achieves with limited success in his brawny, bloodthirsty blockbuster '300' with 'Dracula 2000' star Gerard Butler. Warner Brothers has racked up another major box office bonanza with their $60-million production of graphic novelist Frank Miller's 1998 comic book about the legendary battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. in Greece between the Spartans and heathen Persians. Talk about art inspiring art, Miller drew his idea for '300' from the more realistic though far less sanguinary 20th Century Fox epic 'The 300 Spartans' (1962) that toplined Richard Egan as King Leonidas during the heyday of the Italian Peplum genre about Hercules, Ulysses, Goliath, Atlas, and Samson. Clocking in with one hour and 57 minutes of mayhem, treachery, and hard, glistening abs and pectoral muscles on display, '300' illustrates what happens when Hollywood rewrites ancient history with mind-blowing computer-generated imagery. Unfortunately, for Snyder and co-scenarists Michael B. Gordon and Kurt Johnstad, the spectacle of '300' overwhelms its dramatic intensity and character development.Not surprisingly, Snyder, Gordon, and Johnstad rely on time-honored but unimaginative narration to bring its attention-deficient teenager audience up to snuff on Fifth century history. We're told little boys in Sparta trained from their youth to be fearless warriors. Living to kill, they killed to live. As Leonidas says early in the action: 'We Spartans have descended from Hercules himself. Taught never to retreat, never to surrender. Taught that death in the battlefield is the greatest glory he could achieve in his life. Spartans: the finest soldiers the world has ever known.' They also did some other things that Snyder and company have shrewdly eliminated that might have appealed to a larger audience but would have netted them an NC-17 rating. Peruse an unexpurgated account about ancient Grecian history and you'll learn the rest of the unfettered story. Once the filmmakers have established a basic knowledge of the setting that takes about a quarter hour, they introduce us to heroic King Leonidas (Scottish actor Gerard Butler of 'The Phantom of the Opera') and his beautiful but anorexic Queen Gorgo (British actress Lena Headey of 'The Cave') who talk a lot about freedom not being free. Indeed, you can draw some parallels between their dialogue and the American quagmire of Iraq and the Middle East at large. Snyder then trots out the evil, wicked villains, the Persians. These guys look either repulsive with their faces draped with jewelry and numerous piercings or depraved 'Shriek' types with misshapen bodies. Xerxes (Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro of TV's 'Lost') sends emissaries to warn Leonidas that the Spartans should surrender before his mammoth army of over a million wipe them out and turn their wives and children into slaves. Leonidas with a nod from Gorgo sends the emissary and his bodyguards plunging to their deaths in a deep well. Leonidas follows the Spartan custom of seeking the advice of a group of depraved oracles that reside atop mountains and intoxicate teenage girls before they issue their decrees. They warn Leonidas that Sparta is doomed, and our plain-spoken protagonist storms off in contempt and disgust to round up 300 of his best to meet the worst that Persia offers. What neither Leonidas nor his queen know is that a traitor in their midst, Theron (Dominic West of 'The Wire'), has already accepted bribes from the Persians to lay Sparta open to the Asian horde.'300' cuts back and forth between the fierce Spartan warriors battling the Persians on the Greek coast near a narrow mountain pass called 'the Hot Gates' and Queen Gorgo's futile efforts to raise reinforcements for her husband's aid. Theron has convinced Spartan leaders that Leonidas has broken the law by taking marching off with his troops without the approval of the politicians. Predictably, like the battle of the Alamo in American history, the Spartans in '300' are whittled down to nothing by a force six times its size.By and large, '300' falls back on wholesale slaughter as entertainment. We see at least three men get their heads slashed off at the neck as well as numerous shots of severed arms, legs, and hands. The chief problems in '300' are the ersatz computer generated graphics. Synder lensed it on a sound-stage in Montreal using green screens to project all of its bogus looking backdrops, especially when the Persian fleet wallows in angry seas and many of its fleet sink. Anybody who doesn't know what the green screen or blue screen back projection process looks like should catch a local weather forecast. All those graphics are generated by a computer while the forecaster stands in front of a blank green or blue wall and points to areas that he or she sees on a television monitor. Worse, '300' is so choked with blood and gore that all the characters, except Leonidas, are lost in the violence. When our heroes aren't killing Persians, they spend their time finishing off the mutilated survivors and then stack them into walls of flesh to topple on the next wave of Persians. Xerxes makes a spectacular entrance, and his first confrontation with Leonidas is dramatic, but afterward he becomes just another cardboard character. Nothing relieves the film from its constant killing. There is nothing remotely humorous here, unlike some of the funnier confrontations in Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart.' Altogether, '300' looks like a spectacular video-game with half-hearted drama tossed in between the slaughtering. Guys will savor the cutting edge violence while females will ogle the warriors as if these ancient Spartans were nothing more than leather-thonged Chipendale strippers wading into war with swords and shields.",9,1,5,10 May 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fifty Shades of Blood!!!
","Imagine putting the James Bond movies into a cinematic blender with the Austin Powers comedies, and you'll see what British director Matthew Vaughn does with his outlandish movie 'Kingsman: The Secret Service.' For the record, Vaughn made his first film as a director in 2004 with the murderous mobster melodrama 'Layer Cake' (2004) starring Daniel Craig. Three years later he followed up 'Layer Cake' with 'Stardust.' This imaginative Neil Gaiman fantasy romance bore little resemblance to the gritty 'Layer Cake.' Vaughn didn't come into his own until he adapted Mark Millar's subversive graphic novel 'Hit Girl' as the Nicolas Cage actioneer 'Kick Ass.' This controversial revenge thriller about a dad and daughter who dressed like comic book super-heroes to destroy a dastardly gangster spawned a sequel. Vaughn's biggest success came with the incomparable Marvel Comics 'X-Men' prequel 'X-Men: First Class' about the costume-clad mutants in their youth during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Vaughn has recycled many of the themes and characters from those movies for his adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' that features Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong. This uneven but entertaining homage to the James Bond movies provides an overdue departure from the usual formulaic, testosterone laden fare that sacrifices wit and style for realism and gore. Mind you, Vaughn grinds his action gears during the early scenes as he sets up his improbable plot. Happily, he has everything running smoothly for an explosive finale. The big problem that Vaughn had to contend with in launching a new franchise was pairing relatively unknown actor Taron Egerton with veteran actor Colin Firth who rarely plays armed and deadly heroes. Meanwhile, sympathetic heroes and treacherous villains tangle mercilessly in this larger-than-life, hyperbolic espionage escapade that could easily qualify as '50 Shades of Blood' for its sensational number of mind-blowing action scenes. Hundreds of thousands of people perish when an evil megalomaniac plans to solve overpopulation by implanting SIM cards into their heads, controlling their thoughts, and converting their cell phones into improvised explosive devices. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' qualifies as the kind of silly but stout, R-rated saga that might repel squeamish moviegoers.Matthew Vaughn and his wife Jane Golden, who has collaborated on every film her husband has helmed except 'Layer Cake,' have adapted Mark Millar's graphic novel with the same audacious abandon that they infused in 'Kick Ass.' Indeed, they have made some extreme but inspired changes to Millar's narrative. 'Kingsman' concerns an independent, international espionage agency hidden behind the faÃ§ade of an elite tailor's shop on London's Savile Row that operates at the highest level of discretion like 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E' television series. This private outfit makes Navy SEALs look like second-rate shrimp. Indeed, if such an ultra-secret organization existed, world peace would be guaranteed. Latter day British knights of the realm with appropriate code-names like Lancelot and Galahad, these dudes cut dashing figures in their globe-trotting missions to preserve peace and solidarity. The cream of their crop, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), ranks as their top agent. He is at his best when he has little more than an umbrella to vanquish the villains. British actor Colin Firth, who plays the impeccably clad protagonist, has been acting since 1984, but he is known largely as a lightweight leading man in romantic comedies like 'Mamma Mia!,' 'Shakespeare in Love,' and 'Bridget Jones' Diary.' In 2007, he ventured out of his comfort zone and played an armor-clad knight in the above-average medieval swashbuckler 'The Last Legion.' During one of Vaughn's many impressively staged action set-pieces, Firth devastates a hatemongering Westboro-style church congregation in a no-holds-barred, free-for-all fracas.As 'Kingsman' unfolds, Harry Hart's closest comrade, Lancelot (Jack Davenport), dies during a mission but saves Harry's life. Predictably, Harry consoles Lancelot's grieving widow and son. Understandably distraught by her husband's mysterious demise, Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack of 'Breeders') wants nothing to do with Kingsman. Nevertheless, Harry persuades her only son, Eggsy, to accept Lancelot's medal inscribed with a phone number and a code word should he ever require help. Seventeen years later, as an underprivileged teen living in the projects, Eggsy finds himself in deep trouble. Our wild, impulsive hero steals an automobile belonging to a gang of loutish British lads who have been badgering him. Commandeering their vehicle for a joyride, Eggsy careens through congested London traffic, driving the vehicle in reverse, with the police following him nose to nose, as he executes several complicated maneuvers. Vaughn excels with suspenseful scenes like this careening car chase. Later, with nobody to help him, Gary 'Eggys' Unwin (newcomer Taron Egerton) contacts Harry. After Harry gets Eggsy out of the clink, he takes him for a tour of a local tailor's shop that serves as a front for Kingsman. Since he feels guilty about the death of Eggys' dad, Harry helps the lad compete with other candidates for the job-of-a-lifetime as a Kingsman. After surviving the gauntlet of an incredible obstacle course, Eggys stands poised to become a top agent who can match wits and swap fists with either James Bond or Jason Bourne. Unfortunately, our hero commits some interesting mistakes before he can redeem himself in the eyes of the Kingsman and save the world.Samuel L. Jackson steals the show as goofy looking, Internet billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine. Adopting with a quirky lisp, Jackson wears his baseball cap askew like a gangsta. Clearly, Valentine represents Jackson's best performance since 'Pulp Fiction.' Although the tongue-in-cheek Jackson overshadows handsome Harry Hart and his unusual arsenal of weapons, Valentine's number one henchman--perhaps 'henchm'am would be better--is a gravity-defying dame equipped with razor-sharp, 'Flex-Foot Cheetah' blade feet, who slices up her adversaries like deli meat. Nothing can prepare you for Algerian dancer Sofia Boutella of 'StreetDance 2' when she performs her breathtaking acrobatic feats in a variation on Oddjob and his razor sharp bowler hat from the Bond groundbreaker 'Goldfinger.' Altogether, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' amounts to amusing but polished nonsense.",9,2,10,19 February 2015
Easy A," What Would John Hughes Do?
","'Easy A' earns an A as an excellent movie. This sophisticated comedy celebrates liberal causes and embraces diversity. Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) gets in trouble when she tells her best friend Rhiannon that she spent a weekend with a college guy. Mind you, Olive had no date and spent the entire weekend in her room with her dog as her only companion, and played the song 'I've Got A Pocket of Sunshine.' Later, at school, Rhiannon refuses to believe that her oldest friend didn't have sex with a college guy. Reluctantly, our heroine breaks down under pressure and admits that she did have sex. A bubble-headed Christian fanatic, Marianne, occupies a stall when Olive makes her confession to Rhiannon. Later, Olive helps a homosexual guy out at her high school who is being bullied by the straight guys. She takes Brandon (Dan Byrd) to Melody Bostic's party and they fake like they are having incredible sex. Afterward, Brandon has nothing to worry about because all the guys treat him now as one of them. Olive attracts scandal and acquires a sordid reputation. Eventually, word leaks out in certain quarters that Olive and Brandon didn't have sex and others bribe Olive so say they have had sex with her. Meantime, Marianne, does her best to derail all of Olive's plans and launches a smear campaign against her. Marianne emerges as the chief villainous in 'Easy A.' Olive gets in trouble with the school principal when she calls one of Marianne's minions Nina (Mahaley Manning) a 'twat.' Olive is blessed with two of the most liberal parents in the world and they have adopted an African-American child. 'Easy A' qualifies as refresh, funny, and fast-moving. Emma Stone is sensational!",10,1,2,19 December 2012
Fast Five," 'Mission Impossible' Meets 'Ocean's Eleven' On Hot Wheels!
","As the fourth sequel in 'The Fast and the Furious' franchise, 'Five Fast' combines elements of a Tom Cruise 'Mission Impossible' epic as well as the George Clooney, Brad Pitt & Matt Damon 'Ocean's Eleven' outings. Our high-octane protagonists have fled south to Rio de Janeiro. They plan to steal a fortune in cold cash from Brazil's most dangerous man because he has framed them for murder. Swift, swerving, snappy reflex driving constitutes an integral part of this careening carefree narrative. Mind you, the larger-than-life heist and the way our heroes not only prepare but also pull it off absorbs about half of the film's brisk 130 minutes. Justin Lin and his three-time 'Fast and Furious' collaborator scenarist Chris Morgan have raised the stakes again so they can top 'Fast & Furious' and they've done a splendid job of topping the previous epic. When Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Conner aren't tangling with murderous Brazilian thugs, they must contend with an incorruptible good guy. Tenacious Federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson of 'Doom') vows to hunt them down and apprehend them and he never quits. Literally, our heroes are between a 'Rock' and a hard place! 'The Fast and the Furious' franchise has evolved over the last decade from illegal street racing done in conjunction with some crime. Initially, the speeders hijacked eighteen-wheelers for their loads. Since 'Fast & Furious,' they have involved themselves in bigger crimes. The life & death heist here is as outlandish as it is audacious. Indeed, 'Fast Five' surpasses 'Fast & Furious' for no other reason than its final 30 minutes overshadows everything before it. No, Toretto and O'Connor couldn't have gotten away with their ambitious scheme in real life any more than they could navigate those tunnels without accident in 'Fast & Furious.' Nevertheless, Lin and Morgan make their strenuous efforts look like a lot of fun, something that the tunnel racing sequences lacked.'Fast Five' opens where 'Fast & Furious' ended. Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Vin Diesel of 'xXx') has been sentenced to 25 years in Lompoc prison. Former FBI agent Paul O'Connor (Paul Walker of 'Into the Blue') and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of 'Annapolis') along with another driver wreck the prison bus in route so Dom can escape. Incredibly, nobody is hurt in the accident. The opening gambit in the previous movie 'Fast & Furious' was so good it made the rest of it appear anti-climactic, but this isn't the case in 'Fast Five.' Indeed, Lin and Morgan top themselves in 'Fast Five.' Once O'Connor and Mia have Dom sprung, they are approached by Dom's childhood friend Vince (Matt Schulze of 'Blade 2') about a railroad heist where they will steal some sports cars. This heist recalls the opening gambit in 'Fast & Furious.' A wrecker cruises up alongside a train. The thieves cut an oblong hole in the freight car containing the vehicles. They catapult the cars out sideways onto the wrecker's ramp and then lower the ramp so the drivers can back down off it and peel away in a cloud of dust. Of course, nothing can go smoothly in a heist movie. Our heroes discover the DEA has impounded the cars and their native gun-toting accomplices refuse to let the DEA thwart them. The Brazilian gunmen kill the DEA agents without a qualm, while our heroes are incriminated for the killings. Dom helps O'Connor get off the train, but Dom has to plummet his convertible into a river. They jump for their lives.The Feds dispatch Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of 'Faster') to capture Toretto and O'Connor. Meanwhile, Dom concocts an incredible plan to take over a $100-million from the man whose killers gunned down the DEA agents. In South America, crooked entrepreneur Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia of 'Desperado') rules the country. Reyes gets whatever he demands. Our heroes find a computer chip in a confiscated Reyes' sports cars. The chip contains a treasure-trove of information about all of Reye's cash stashes. Dom urges them to pull 'one last job' and rob Reyes blind. Our protagonists assemble a racing team that includes O'Connor's childhood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson of '2 Fast 2 Furious'), Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of '2 Fast 2 Furious'), Han Lue (Sung Kang of 'Tokyo Drift'), former Israeli intelligence agent Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot of 'Fast & Furious'), and a couple of others. Dom and company strike the first of Reye's safe houses. Reye's men watch in horror as our heroes burn the money. Immediately, Reye relocates his fortune to the downtown police station. He locks it up in a vault that can only be opened with his hand print. If you've seen the trailer for 'Fast Five,' you know they steal the entire vault and then drag it like a wrecking ball through town so the finale looks like a demolition derby.Ultimately, 'Fast Five' is about having a good time. Again, the heroes are the underdogs, while the villains are thoroughly treacherous. The Rock shows up as a good guy caught in the crossfire. He is wants to capture our heroes because they are his quarry. Of course, the fast driving scenes thrive on adrenalin-pacing. The numerous gunfights are noisy enough with everybody blasting away at each without blinking. 'Fast Five' reunites virtually everybody and then some who have survived all previous epics. Naturally, the Brazilian scenery is fabulous, and 'Fast Five' serves as a travelogue when Lin and Morgan aren't wrapping expository scenes about the heist around our ears. A mindless epic about motorized mayhem, 'Fast Five' springs some surprises that change everything that will make you yearn for a fifth sequel. Be advised, don't leave the theater until the entire end credits roll, you're definitely in for a shock.",9,1,4,9 May 2011
The Thin Red Line," Malick's self-absorbed, anti-war rhetoric sinks 'The Thin Red Line'
","If you march into director Terrence Malick's World War II epic 'The Thin Red Line' expecting more of the same over-the-top, gung-ho heroics that made Steven Spielberg's predictable but entertaining 'Saving Private Ryan' a multi-million dollar triumph, prepare to retreat! Loosely based on James Jones' mammoth World War II novel, Malick's account of the Guadalcanal campaign in 1943 is a dreary, drawn-out, message-laden maneuver. Despite its celebrity cast, its authentic settings (indeed, they filmed on the real Guadalcanal), and the artistic pretensions of its prodigal movie director who returned to Hollywood after a twenty year hiatus, 'The Thin Red Line' hits the beach like a casualty. Clocking in at a lethargic two hours and fifty-five minutes, 'The Thin Red Line' retreads in lush color what the more modest 1965 black & white predecessor covered in a trim 99 minutes.Aside from their shared literary source, director Andrew Marton's 1965 version of Guadalcanal is more palatable than Malick's hopelessly platitudinous remake. For example, in Malick's version, more than a half-hour elapses before American troops start firing on the Japanese enemy! 'The Thin Red Line' remake opens languidly, with a National Geographic prologue on a remote island with friendly natives where an insubordinate G.I. gone AWOL, Private Witt (Jim Caviezel of 'Frequency') is hiding out with a buddy. The Navy nabs Witt about ten minutes into the action. Believe me, those first ten minutes crawl. You spend most of your time in 'The Thin Red Line' waiting for something dramatic to occur. Meanwhile, the Army assembles off shore from the Japanese-held Guadalcanal, with pompous Brigadier General Quintard (John Travolta of 'The Punisher') lectures Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Tall (rugged Nick Nolte of '48 Hrs'), a career soldier, about the importance of victory.As the nominal stars of 'The Thin Red Line,' Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin are relatively unknown and difficult to tell apart on the screen. Caviezel's Private Witt explains to his sergeant that all he wants is 'to make a difference in life.' The seasoned sergeant grimaces, 'a man alone is nothing,' adding, 'you've got to shut your eyes and look out for yourself. Meanwhile, Ben Chaplin's Private Bell obsesses over the girl that he left behind. He worships her like a saint until he receives a 'Dear John' letter. Yes, you guessed it, she got a fly-boy Caviezel's Witt makes a difference in the end, but Chaplin's Bell is let to ponder his break-up.Some terrific actors get lost in the mix of Malick's self-absorbed, anti-war rhetoric. Nick Nolte chews the scenery as an ambitious colonel, while Sean Penn turns in a tight-lipped performance as a soft-hearted sergeant. John Cusack shows up long enough to lead a valiant attack on a Japanese machine gun nest. Other familiar faces such as Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, George Clooney, Elias Koteas, Jared Leto, and John Savage appear in brief roles that hearken back to cameo-laden classics like 'The Longest Day' and 'A Bridge Too Far.' Nobody gets a chance to develop a memorable character with whom audiences can identify as well as sympathize with during the films marathon length.Malick indulges in voice over narration which the actors deliver in the hushed tons of TV sportscasters at a golf tournament. 'The Thin Red Line' depicts nothing that hundreds of other war movies haven't already shown. In his depiction of combat, Malick doesn't push the envelop the way that 'Saving Private Ryan' did. Meanwhile, Malick departs from the rules of clear, concise storytelling. Plot lines that overlap with little clarity as well as sketchy characterization make 'The Thin Red Line' difficult to follow. Nobody takes front and center presence like either Tom Hanks or Matt Damon in 'Saving Private Ryan.' Malick skips back and forth among too many characters for audiences to build a rapport with any single individual.Snobbish cinemaphiles who prefer the avant-garde approach that ignores basic storytelling and shuns sensationalism have fallen into ranks behind 'The Thin Red Line.' Now, if you're a media theorist, a humanities scholar, or a deranged cult movie iconoclast, 'The Thin Red Line' will absolutely enthrall you. You'll rave about the film's Rousseauistic virtues, and you'll point out how Malick turns Guadalcanal into a corrupted 20th century Eden. No doubt, you'll belabor the obvious significance of a crocodile swimming free and later seen trussed up in the bed or an Army truck.'The Thin Red Line' qualifies as more of a metaphysical than a mainstream movie. If 'The Thin Red Line' were half of the classic that its intellectual advocates argue, Terence Malick's emergence from cinematic obscurity would be noteworthy. Alas, 'The Thin Red Line' fails to provide a catharsis and lacks the minimal quota of heroes, villains, and explosions. Do not cross 'The Thin Red Line' if you thrive on genre war classics like 'The Naked and the Dead,' 'The Dirty Dozen,' 'Platoon,' and 'Sands of Iwo Jima.'",1,3,11,2 July 2008
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Fun!
","Watching the new Marvel Comics movie 'The Fantastic Four' (***1/2 out of ****) was a lot of fun. Don't expect anything as high-brow as either of the 'X-Men' or the 'Spider-man' epics. Meantime, this classic Marvel superheroes saga surpasses both the lackluster 'Electra' and the horrible 'Hulk.' Principally, 'The Fantastic Four' suffers from showing up too late to exploit its groundbreaking elements, since most of this family-friendly fare recycles material that 'X-Men' and 'Spider-man' have already converted into clichés. Ironically, 'The Fantastic Four' comic debuted in 1961, long before either 'X-Men' or 'Spider-man' appeared. Indeed, 'The Fantastic Four' paved the way for 'X-Men' and 'Spider-man,' but the formative franchise is paying the price for reaching the screen later than its spin-offs. Unlike early Marvel Comics movies, 'The Fantastic Four' resorts to refreshing comic relief bordering on slapstick. The heroes spend a fair share of their time goofing off. Check out how Reed Richards wraps himself like a rubber band around an enraged Ben Grimm. Moreover, unlike most Marvel comic superheroes, this quartet doesn't shrink from attention and has no need to shield their identity. This sets 'The Fantastic Four' apart from the usual summer superhero saga, because the narrative exposure that they receive from cosmic rays cannot compare with the exposure that the media accords them. Consequently, if you're 'The Fantastic Four' bound because you believe it clones 'X-Men' or 'Spider-man,' prepare to be let down! 'The Fantastic Four' unfolds with down-on-his-luck whiz kid scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd of 'King Arthur') and his best bud, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis of TV's 'The Shield'), appealing to their old collegiate chum, billionaire industrialist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon of TV's 'Nip/Tuck'), to fund their weird science project. Reed needs Victor's space station to analyze the consequences of cosmic rays on living matter. Victor rubs Reed's nose in Reed's own highly publicized bankruptcy case. Reedit seemsis flat broke. Later, Victor stuns Reed when he reveals that he knows why NASA gave Reed the boot over the project. Nevertheless, the greedy tycoon provides the funding for Reed's experiment. Not surprisingly, everything goes wrong once they are in space. All Reed's calculations are wholly off, and the cosmic rays arrive early and irradiate everybody on board Victor's space station. Not until later do they learn that exposure to those cosmic rays has a lasting effect on their DNA. The next thing we know the story is back on Earth with our heroes under medical observation. Johnny discovers that he can conjure up fire from his finger tips. Sue learns that she can turn invisible and lay down a force field. Reed's flexibility enables him to run his hand and arm under a locked door and unlock the door from the other side! By far the worst effected is Ben Grimm. He changes into a giant, orange-colored, stone-textured, Michelin man type brute that Johnny ridicules as 'the Thing.' Not to be left out, Victor acquires a metallic complexion and can wield electricity like a deadly weapon. Instead of joining ranks with his partners, Victor dons a Darth Vader-like helmet, christens himself Dr. Doom, and vows to destroy the Fantastic Four! Splendidly cast with some fresh faces, director Tim Story's 'The Fantastic Four' doesn't alter the formula for superhero franchises. Conspicuously free of social issues, this superficial but entertaining summer romp refuses to furrow your brows, but it tops the unreleased Roger Corman version of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's quarrelsome quartet. Corman produced his charming but cheapjack feature back in 1994 for a mere one million dollars, while 20th Century Fox has hurled a hundred million dollars into their CGI-enhanced, big-screen adaptation. The titular four are predictably charismatic, and the villain qualifies as evil incarnate. 'The Fantastic Four' combines larger-than-life, fantasy-oriented violence with sure-fire, character-driven, fish-out-of-water comedy. Indeed, these mutated heroes differ from the 'X-Men,' because their deformities are what fuel their popularity. Although some special effects--especially Reed's elastic armslook rather cheesy, and the plot doesn't pass the two-hour mark, 'The Fantastic Four' delivers enough action and comedy to distract you during its brisk 105 minutes without wearing out its welcome.'Barbershop' director Tim Story and scenarists Michael ('GoldenEye' & 'The Punisher') France and Mark ('Twin Peaks') Frost have confined the action to the character origins. Indeed, Story, France, and Frost have their hands full dealing not only with the heroic quartet but also with the dastardly Dr. Doom. Happily, nobody gets the short-shrift, and each character evolves in greater detail despite the lightweight treatment. Again, the difference between 'The Fantastic Four' and other Marvel superheroes is that these guys are media celebrities with no need to conceal their identities. Typically, opening franchise films present the genesis of the protagonists then pit them in a life-or-death battle against their arch adversary. 'The Fantastic Four' chronicles how the cosmic rays afflict each character, and then shows how each individual handles this hardship. While the villainous Dr. Doom challenges our heroes, the climactic showdown in 'The Fantastic Four' serves more to demonstrate the moral gulf between the Four and their foe, without wasting another half-hour setting up a threat to mankind that our heroes must thwart. The biggest complaint about 'The Fantastic Four' is that it's trite and resembles a TV show pilot episode. If such charges are accurate, then this is a super duper pilot, bigger than any that I've ever seen. However, not all superhero movies must resort to the standard threat-to-mankind plot. Essentially, what Story, France, and Frost fare best at is finding a balance between the tragic elements, such as Ben Grimm's massive metamorphosis, and the comedic antics of Johnny Storm pyromaniacal shenanigans, while incorporating the romantic byplay between Sue and Reed Richards. Finally, unlike the larger world threat superhero movies, 'The Fantastic Four' qualifies as a more personal superhero movie. Although it isn't as memorable as either 'X-Men' or 'Spider-man,' 'The Fantastic Four' with its built-in sequel ending is still pretty exhilarating stuff.",9,3,4,20 June 2007
The Great Escape," The Greatest World War II P.O.W. Movie Since 'Stalag 17!'
","Director John Sturges had been struggling for eleven years to produce a movie based on Paul Brickhill's non-fiction bestseller 'The Great Escape' (1949), an autobiographical account of one of the largest Allied prisoner of war break out attempts in World War II. An Australian Royal Air Force pilot, who had been incarcerated in Stalag Luft III, Brickhill documented the escape of 250 British POWs to tie up German troops behind the lines. The plan involved the digging of three tunnels far beneath the ground to avoid sound detection from microphones buried in the earth. The POWs considered every angle of this massive enterprise. Tailors converted uniforms into civilian clothing. Forges duplicated passes, permits, identity cards. Not only did the tunnels have to be excavated, but the POWs also had to dispose of the soil without arousing the suspicions. Brickhill participated in the two-year long escape plan and served as the man in charge of the security stooges who shielded the forgers from the German security guards that acted as 'ferrets' trying to flush out escape attempts. British South African pilot Roger Bushnel, head of the escape committee, envisaged taking out 250, but only 76 managed to getaway before the Germans discovered them. Eventually, only three escaped, while the Germans recovered another 23 men. The Gestapo captured the remaining fifty and Adolph Hitler ordered them executed by firing squad. The problem that Sturges encountered when he pitched the idea to various producers, among them Samuel Goldwyn, was the ironic narrative. 'What the hell kind of escape is this?' Goldwyn hated The Great Escape, 'Nobody gets away!' Louis B. Mayer refused to make it owing to the conspicuous absence of women. Oscar winning epics, like 'Stalag 17' (1953) and 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957) had not altered the attitudes of studio executives about tragic endings. Meanwhile, John Sturges soldiered on and made westerns, crime films, and soap operas for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures until the early 1960s. Competition with television as well as the 1948 Supreme Court mandate that studios liquidate their theater chains because the moguls had been operating in restraint of trade, contributed to the erosion of traditional studio system. Independent producers came into their own and wielded greater clout for getting offbeat films made. Producers Harold, Marvin, and Walter Mirish had been toiling assiduously at Allied Artists to produce A-quality pictures, but their efforts had borne little fruit. At the time, United Artists changed the way Hollywood conducted business. Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin, and D.W. Griffith had formed the studio in the 1919. United Artists owned no studio back lots. Instead, the company distributed films. Since United Artists had no product to distribute in the early 1950s, the studio had been losing money on its global distribution network. Pickford and Chaplin agreed to let a firm of entertainment attorneys run the company. Meanwhile, the Mirish Brothers had been courting prominent directors who wanted to make pictures of their own choosing. The Mirish Brothers approached United Artists executives and engineered an independent deal to provide UA with a slate of films that they would produce, but the studio would bankroll. Mirish co-produced 'The Magnificent Seven' (1960) with director John Sturges, and the incredible overseas success of the film enabled Sturges to convince Mirish to purchase the rights to Brickhill's novel and produce the film.'The Great Escape' marked the zenith of John Sturges' career as a director and made an international star out of Steve McQueen. McQueen's motorcycle stunts make the last half-hour of the movie. No, he didn't make the big jump. 'The Great Escape' bristles with action, excitement, humor, tension, patriotism, suspense, and tragedy. Most of the action is based on fact, but Sturges had to take some liberties. McQueen's motorcycle scenes were added as well the Americans. The Germans had moved the Americans out of the camp by the time of the escape.Elmer Bernstein's awesome music underlines every key moment in this epic length story.Ironically, despite its military narrative, 'The Great Escape' emerged as the most anti-authoritative big studio film of the day, foreshadowing movies such as Cool Hand Luke (1967), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and Easy Rider (1969). Walter Mirish remembered The Great Escape as one of his favorites. He applauded the message of the film. No matter how impossible the odds, defiant men proved with their wits and will that nothing can stop them from accomplishing a goal. The engineering feats in constructing tunnels, effecting escapes, and tying up German soldiers made 'The Great Escape' the apex of World War II POW movies. Furthermore, 'The Great Escape' condemned the barbarism of the Gestapo for murdering the fifty POW escapees and hammered home the necessity for destroying the Third Reich.",10,1,4,9 July 2009
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," 'Eclipse' Eclipses 'Twilight' and 'New Moon'
","Stephenie Meyers and the people producing the cinematic adaptations of her supernatural 'Twilight' novels know how to stretch a good thing out. Happily, the elasticity in this interspecies romance franchise hasn't frayed over the last two blockbuster films. The outstanding third installment, '30 Days of Night' director David Slade's 'Eclipse' literally eclipses both 'Twilight' and 'New Moon' with more action that either predecessor boasted. Not only do the pugnacious werewolves look more realistic, but also 'Twilight' scenarist Melissa Rosenberg has intensified the competition in the three-way romance between Bella and her two jealous suitors Edward and Jacob. Indeed, Edward and Jacob have at least two substantial, well-written scenes where they analyze their behavior toward each other in light of Bella. They spar without touching each other. Mind you, the narrative is somewhat predictable because Bella still yearns to be a vampire while Edward staunchly opposes her obsession. Basically, the action is unfinished business. When Edward isn't trying to discourage Bella's desire to be undead, Jacob struggles to convince her that she really loves him. He argues that nothing serious will change if she chooses him over Edward. Some of the narrative threads left over from 'Twilight' that were partially tied up in 'New Moon' are mopped up here in 'Eclipse.' The evil Victoria has been biding her time to exact sweet revenge on Edward for destroying her vampire lover James. Further, the Volturi lurk on the fringe of the mayhem with malice aforethought. 'Eclipse' opens in Seattle where twentysomething Forks native Riley Biers (Xavier Samuels of 'Road Kill') leaves a restaurant after dark during a light downpour. He is attacked without warning by an unseen assailant in a lonely alley. No matter what Riley tries to do, he cannot elude his attacker. Indeed, we can see little more than Riley, just a blur of something menacing him. On the docks, the mysterious attacker slashes at Riley's hand, and he winds up writhing in agony. 'Eclipse' gets off to a grim start, but things lighten up as the scene shifts to Forks in a meadow where Bella and Edward discussing matters of the heart. Interestingly, the film concludes with them back in the meadow as a prelude to the last 'Twilight' movie 'Breaking Dawn.' Meanwhile, Bella's poor father, Forks County Sheriff Charlie (Billy Burke of 'Jane Austen's Mafia!'), doesn't have a clue about Edward and Bella's relationship. Basically, Charlie would like to see Bella see somebody other than Edward and prods her to visit Jacob. Naturally, Edward abhors every second that Bella spends with Jacob. He assures Bella that he trusts her, but he puts no trust in Jacob. Meanwhile, clairvoyant Alice (Ashley Greene of 'King of California') has a vision about the trouble in Seattle, but she cannot put her finger on who is stirring up the trouble. Eventually, the Cullens learn that an army of newborns is being assembled in Seattle, but they don't know who is behind them. After a time, they learn that Forks native Riley Biers, who has been reported as missing, may be at the core of the problem. Predictably, Edward tries to shield Bella from the truth, but he doesn't get any help from Jacob. Earlier, Edward and Bella flew to Florida so she could spend time with her mom. During their absence, the vampires fractured the treaty with the Indians. They were pursuing fleet-footed, high jumping Victoria through the forest when she hurls herself across a stream into werewolf country. Emmett Cullen (Kellan Lutz of 'Accepted') found himself face-to-face with a snarling werewolf while Victoria gave both of them the slip. Not surprisingly, Jacob is appalled that Edward hasn't told Bella about the incident or that it was Victoria. Essentially, Jacob and his tribe enter the fight when they learn that vampires may storm the country. Of course, neither the newborns nor the Volturi know anything about Jacob and his shape-shifting werewolves.The violence in 'Eclipse' is quite stylized. When the vampires attack each other, they look like they are playing a game of old-fashioned football where the goal is to batter the opponents more than score a touchdown. The fatal blows that are delivered make it look like our heroes are smashing live-action statues. Not only do the vampires never bare their fangs, but also the blood and gore are confined within the limits of a PG-13 rating. According to Dr. Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli of 'Supernova'), these 'newborn' vampires pose a threat because they are actually stronger than either the Cullens or any other vampire because they still have some of their own human blood in their system. They live to the hilt of their existence and they have a difficult time keeping a low profile. If you remember 'New Moon,' you will remember that the law of the Volturi, the Supreme Count of Vampires, condemns any fangster that calls attention to themselves or their breed. The thing that holds this Gothic melodrama together so well is the theme of change. 'Eclipse' examines Bella's decision to renounce life in favor of becoming a vampire and the various opinions that the Cullen clan as well as Jacob offer about it. Like previous 'Twilight' directors, David Slade seems to know when to let the drama dominate and the violence roar. Nevertheless, Slade also knows when to insert humor that lightens the mood without overexposing anything. Moreover, 'Eclipse' provides a glimpse into the lives of Jasper Whitlock and Rosalie Hale and how they became vampires. The school graduation speech that Jessica Stanley delivers is refreshingly different. 'New Moon' lenser Javier Aguirresarobe encores as director of photography, and he creates a palate of moody colors that reflect the tension and the atmosphere. He also captures the pictorial beauty of the surroundings as well as the luminous cast with his widescreen compositions. In short, 'Eclipse' qualifies as a grand looking movie.",10,3,11,11 July 2010
John Wick: Chapter 2," 'Wick 2' Is 2 Wicked!!!
","Hollywood makes out two types of sequels. First, those sequels that aren't as good as their forerunners. Second, those sequels that surpass their predecessors. Basically, sequels are either better or worse than what spawned them. 'John Wick: Chapter 2' belongs to the second category. Stunt double Chad Stahelski and scenarist Derek Kolstad respectively return as director and writer for the bullet-riddled bloodbath 'John Wick 2,' and Keanu Reeves reprises his role as the invincible, sharp-shooting assassin who doesn't aim to please. No, Wick's new pet pooch doesn't die in this installment. Moreover, no other animals are harmed. Anybody who saw the original 'John Wick' knows the villains spoke in awe about John Wick's lethal use of pencils. Appropriately enough, Stahelski stages a pencil scene for the sequel, and you will have an entirely new respect for yellow number two pencils. We'll have to see if something like this doesn't ultimately winds up as merchandise to advertise the franchise. This unbreakable pencil preserves its point throughout a slam-bang combat encounter that would shatter a regular pencil. Audaciously preposterous, hopelessly predictable, but thoroughly captivating nonsense, 'John Wick 2' pushes everything to the limit except the number of lines uttered by Keanu Reeves. Tired of gun shy, shoot'em ups that confine their mortality rates to single digits? 'John Wick 2' boasts a triple-digit body count with an alarming number of head shots. Typically, our bruised and battered hero pumps two slugs into an adversary's torso and then polishes them off with one in the noggin. When he exhausts his ammo, he resorts to battlefield salvage and appropriates another man's weapon so he can keep on killing. Meaning, if you require discretion in the depiction of violence, you may have complaints about this exciting, atmospheric, and elegantly lensed action thriller with lots of colorfully illuminated settings. Incidentally, 'John Wick 2' reunites Reeves and 'Matrix' co-star Laurence Fishburne for a couple of scenes. Were it little more than the original, 'John Wick 2' wouldn't be as memorable, but it is something more with some imaginative tweaks that its predecessor lacked.'John Wick: Chapter 2' picks up where the previous epic ended. Since Wick has acquired a new dog, he searches now for the car that his enemies stole, and the film opens with an over-the-top, car-smashing, body-crashing encounter in a rival mobster's garage with our hero relying on wits, fists, and martial arts. Like a respectable sequel, 'John Wick 2' reminds us what was at stake in the first film as well as the character of our hero. A relative of the mobsters who shot Wick's puppy dog and then beat him senseless, Abram (Peter Stormare of '22 Jump Street') is preparing to clear out since he fears Wick is coming after him next. While Wick dispatches Abram's army of thugs and mechanics, Abram's eyes bulge with abject terror, and Stormare gives a great performance by his reactions to the arrival of his adversary. When they finally meet after our hero has cleared a gauntlet of killers, Wick pours Abram a drink and proposes peace with a toast. The two gulp their liquor and forge an armistice. Abram bids Wick a happy retirement. Naturally, however, nothing of the sort is going to happen either for Wick or the audience. In a bit of backstory, we learn that John Wick indebted himself to a treacherous, high-ranking mobster, Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio of 'Loose Cannons'), with a blood oath marker so he could retire and live peacefully with his wife Helen. Now, after wrapping up his revenge, Wick discovers to his chagrin that Santino is calling in that marker! Although Wick is in no position to refuse an assignment from Santino, he refuses to accommodate Santino because he is weary of all the shooting and killing. A disappointed Santino leaves Wick's house and then shoulders an awesome incendiary weapon and fire-bombs our hero's house, blasting Wick off the premises but not killing his dog. Resigned to his fate, Wick sits down with Santino and agrees to carry out one final mission. The evil Santino wants the seat on an international crime council that his late father willed to his older sister, Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini of 'Deceit'), and he stipulates that our hero must ice her. Off to Rome flies Wick where he acquires an arsenal that James Bond would envy, a dark tailor-made, bullet-proof suit, and the blueprints to infiltrate Gianna's inner sanctum and surprise her. What Wick doesn't plan for adequately is Gianna's steadfast bodyguard Cassian (Common of 'American Gangster'), and these two titans tangle in a blood and guts tango that ends abruptly after they crash into the sacred Continental Hotel in Rome, run by Julius (Franco Nero of 'Django'), where mobsters must cease and desist because it represents the equivalent of a gangland church that grants amnesty. At this point, Wick realizes that the scheming Santino has double-crossed him. Santino points out he wouldn't be much of a brother if he didn't avenge the murder of his sister. When his own gunmen cannot liquidate Wick, Santino offers a $7-million-dollar bounty, and hit men from every corner of the globe swarm after our resilient hero.Aside from Keanu Reeves' typically stoic performance, 'John Wick: Chapter Two' features a sturdy cast, with Ian McShane reprising his role as Winston, the manager of the New York City Continental Hotel--where mobsters are prohibited from fighting with their adversaries, and Lance Reddick as the accommodating desk clerk Charon. John Leguizamo appears briefly as the body shop repairman who helped Wick locate his Mustang, and Bridget Moynahan appears in a flashback as Wick's late wife Helen. Director Chad Stahelski, who once earned his living as Keanu Reeve's stunt double, need never look back. Slated to helm the new 'Highlander' reboot, Stahelski keeps things thumping throughout this two-hour plus neo-noir thriller. The hall of mirrors scene where Wick stalks Santino rivals the original scene in Orson Welles' iconic thriller 'The Lady from Shanghai' (1947).",9,6,11,18 February 2017
Jackie Brown," Tarantino Surpasses Himself Again!!!
","If you're expecting more of 'Pulp Fiction' from writer & director Quentin Tarantino in 'Jackie Brown,' the cult moviemaker's first full-fledged cinematic opus since 'Pulp Fiction,' you may feel sorely let down by this extreme chick flick. Neither as sadistic nor as sexually bizarre as either 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Jackie Brown' represents something of a departure for Tarantino. Indeed, an initial viewing may leave you with the impression that 'Jackie Brown' suffers from a sketchy plot and lackluster action. Nothing could be farther from the truth. While 'Jackie Brown' covers familiar 'Pulp Fiction' territory, Tarantino emphasizes characterization at the expense of ultra-violence and implausibility. Furthermore, 'Jackie Brown' may be Tarantino's most accomplished film in its visual storytelling and the performances are simply unforgettable.Veteran African-American actress Pam Grier, who acquired a name for herself during the 1970s with blaxploitation epics such as 'The Big Doll House' (1971) and 'Coffy' (1973), plays the eponymous heroine. As a 44-year old woman, Jackie works as a flight attendant for the worst airline, a shuttle that flies between the United States and Mexico. Life has not exactly been rosy for Jackie. She resorts to smuggling large sums of U.S. currency into the country that belong to Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson of 'Pulp Fiction')a treacherous arms dealer, who stashes his cash in Cabo San Lucas. As the film unfolds, prickly ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton of 'Batman') busts Jackie for sneaking $50-thousand past customs. Nicolette and his LAPD partner Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen of 'Iron Eagle') put the squeeze on her, especially after they discover a two ounce baggie of cocaine hidden in with the bucks.Jackie finds herself in jail, and Robbie posts her bond. Robbie hires bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster of 'Medium Cool') to spring her. Robbie follows an unmistakable pattern. Paranoid about going back to jail, Robbie ices any of his cohorts who come into contact with the law. Jackie got busted thanks to a tip the cops squeezed out of Robbie's low-life henchman Beaumount (Chris Tucker of 'Rush Hour'). After Cherry gets Beaumont out of jail, Robbie kills Beaumont and hides the corpse in the trunk of an abandoned car. Robbie is so leery of his buddies that he brings in an old-time convicted bank robber, Lewis Gara (Robert De Niro of 'Goodfellas') and uses him for his latest scheme.Once out of jail, Jackie cooperates with the ATF. She plans to bring in more of Robbie's dough and be a part of a sting against him. She tell Robbie what the law wants her to do and then presents him with a deal that will get him the rest of his money. She'll bring in all his money at once when the cops aren't expecting it, and they'll pull a switch before the fuzz could figure it out. Robbie is leery again, but eventually he agrees. Meanwhile, Jackie pulls a fast one not only on the cops but also Robbie and get away with a fortune in cold cash. She devises another plan with Max Cherry.While there are no overlapping plots, 'Jackie Brown' is Tarantino's best job of writing. He lays the story out in clear, simple terms and never needlessly complicates the action as he did in 'Pulp Fiction.' You won't get lost in the middle of this action comedy. Of course, the language is as corrosive as all get out. The F-word is used at least 131 times, and the S-word is heard as many as 69 times. Tarantino's fans will appreciate the usual profane, inane dialogue that he writes so well, especially Robbie's instructions to Gara about how to unlock his car.Written and directed by Tarantino, 'Jackie Brown' is based on best-selling novelist Elmore Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch,' published in 1992. Surprisingly, Tarantino removed two major shoot-outs that add bang-bang action to Leonard's book. Robbie wants to kill a Nazi skin head and heist his huge arsenal of firearms. What might have made for a distinctively 'Pulp Fiction' moment, however, Tarantino scrapped. Tarantino also eliminated a gunfight between Nicolette and Robbie's gunmen. Usually, Hollywood filmmakers go out of their way to beef up Leonard's novel. Consider the horrendous misfire that Burt Reynolds produced from Leonard's entertaining novel 'Stick.' While 'Stick' boasted the trademark Leonard dialogue (he c0-scripted), the movie featured violence that the book did not contain. Although Tarantino doesn't capture the quirky Leonard dialogue, he does a better job of transferring 'Rum Punch' to the screen than either Reynolds did with 'Stick' or Barry Sonnenfeld with 'Get Shorty.' As Jackie Brown, busty Pam Grier is ideally cast. Originally written for an Ann-Margret type (in 'Rum Punch' she was named Jackie Burke), Tarantino has changed the racial composition of the heroine but retains the spirit of Leonard's heroine. 'Jackie Brown' is one of those pictures where the heroine isn't fresh out of a Playboy centerfold, though Grier has the obvious endowments. Instead, Tarantino uses her as a woman caught in the middle that wants and deserves to get out of a bad situation. Compared with previous Tarantino efforts, 'Jackie Brown' represents a definite feminist turn of the screw.The supporting cast is both diverse and fantastic. Although Robert Forster has almost vanished from the screen, his performance as Max Cherry is so good and straightforward—in a poker-faced way—that you forget that Forster is acting. Cherry may qualify as one of the few tough-guy male heroes who could serve as a role model. Meanwhile, Robert De Niro brings his customary thespian skill to his bank robber thug and delivers a fastidious performance that relies on his physical presence.'Jackie Brown' lasts over two hours, but nothing obstructs the straight ahead plotting. If you're counting, only three characters get shot, and Tarantino stages each shooting incident off-screen or is shown from an angle that prevents the viewer from seeing much gore and violence.",10,0,2,22 February 2009
Inside Llewyn Davis," Engimatic But Insightful Saga
","The atmospheric, low-key Joel and Ethan Coen folk music saga 'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't like their better efforts. You won't want to watch this one as much as you might 'O Brother Where Art Thou?,' 'True Grit,' 'Fargo,' 'No Country for Old Men,' and 'The Big Lebowski.' Basically, this simple tale concerns a down-on-his-luck folk singer,(Oscar Isaac) who suffers from a case of perennial bad luck. He is broke for most of the time and lives off the generosity of others. His musical efforts haven't paid off and eventually he decides that strumming a guitar in a dark, smoky bar may not be his ultimate calling. At one point, he contemplates going back into the merchant marine but one of his friends has trashed his license. The action unfolds during a week of trials and tribulations for the vocalist. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't a fun film and the songs are not memorable at all. You won't feel better after you watch this polished effort. Nothing really changes in Llewyn's life. He has to arrange an abortion for one of his illicit lovers and in the process discovers that one of his former lovers didn't have an abortion but moved away to Akron and kept the child. Later, he learns that the man who owns the bar where he plays gigs has had sex with the lady for whom he is arranging an abortion. The most interesting thing about this soap opera of sorts is the yellow cat that escapes from a New York City apartment where he is sleeping on the couch. He searches for the elusive feline, finds it, gives it back to its owners only to learn that the city is not the same cat. When the film ends, the call—named Ulysses—has returned. At one point, during a highway trip through the great Northeast, Llewyn hits a cat but he doesn't find it. Llewyn isn't a role model. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't the kind of movie that will make you feel good unless you are a serious fan of indie-type, niche movies with minor characters that lack charisma. Everything that Llewyn tries to do fails, but he sticks with the guitar. As the movie is ending, while he is leaving one Greenwich Village nightspot, he spots another singer who resembles Bob Dylan singing, and the implication is his life may take an upswing because Dylan will make folk singers more prominent. John Goodman, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, and Garrett Hedlund have supporting roles that don't amount to much in this character study epic.",5,0,0,16 May 2014
Sin City," This Sinner Is A Winner!
","The amazing thing about the new Robert Rodriguez movie 'Sin City' is that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) gave this brutal, bullet-riddled, blood-splattered, sadomasochistic, misogynistic, black & white crime fantasy an R-rating. An NC-17 rating would have seemed more appropriate. The mean-spirited murders and mutilations mount into the double-digits, and the mayhem that occurs with predictable regularity throughout its 2-hour plus running time is more than enough to fill two or three movies. About the only thing that isn't savage about this slickly-made synthetic saga is its theme that love motivates some men to sacrifice their lives for their women. Not only does this hard-boiled melodrama replicate panels from the Frank Miller graphic novel series upon which it is based, but also Rodriguez grafts live actors onto computer-generated sets with a visual artistry that eluded last September's 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.' 'Sin City' ranks as a tour-de-force triumph for both Miller and Rodriguez in terms of its fidelity to the source material. The pared down, spartan looking way that Rodriguez stages the larger-than-life heroics here will inevitably generate imitators, especially in the direct-to-video market. Imagine Rodriguez's 'Desperado' crossed with Todd MacFarlane's 'Spawn,' and you'll have an idea what to expect if you haven't seen the ads. Although the bullet-to-the-bone action escalates to new levels of intensity, 'Sin City' layers its ultra-violent action with gallows humor and irony. Characters survive barrages of lead, plunges from high places, cars hitting them, and other miraculous feats that would make Rambo wince. Presumably, Rodriguez obtained a benign R-rating despite the abundant violence in 'Sin City,' because he exaggerates its brutality. All the women, for example, are busty, bare-breasted, blonde babes who dress like strippers and cradle automatic weapons. While it is based on the Miller novels, 'Sin City' owes its imagery, plots, and violence to the cynical film noir thrillers from the 1940s. Indeed, Rodriguez takes the violence to Hong Kong action levels but treats everything like a Roadrunner cartoon. People stand around with arrows shot through them and talk until other arrows silence them. One man tears the genitalia off another as if he were picking berries, and a woman slices off the top of a villain's skull with an airborne martial arts weapon as if she were opening a can with a machete.The Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez screenplay recreates the clichés and conventions of those aforementioned film noir thrillers with a reverence that reeks of nostalgia. Not only does the dialogue bristle with macho Mickey Spillane man-talk, but also the voice-over narration has a philosophical Raymond Chandler ring to it. Essentially, Miller and Rodriguez tell three tales of woe set in an imaginary Sodom and Gomorrah called Basin City. 'Sin City' occupies an unspecified place in time, rather like Walter Hill's 1984 cult classic 'Streets of Fire.' People drive jalopies from the 1940s as well as tricked-out, contemporary European sports cars. The guys prefer trench coats and heavy artillery, while the gals appear straight out of Frank Frazetta paintings with a penchant for Victoria's Secrets lingerie. In the first, Marv (Mickey Rourke of 'Johnny Handsome'), a two-time loser with a heart, wakes up in bed with a dead hooker, Goldie (Jamie King of 'Bulletproof Monk '), and finds himself up against armies of gunmen determined to frame him for her demise. Believe me, you won't forget the scene here when he plunges a thug's head into a toilet bowl that hasn't been flushed. In the second, a cop with a bad ticker, Hartigan (Bruce Willis of 'Pulp Fiction'), tangles with a psychopathic pedophile (Nick Stahl of 'Terminator 3') over innocent 11-year old Nancy Callahan. Eventually, Hartigan goes to prison to keep the villains from learning about Nancy's whereabouts. After he serves 8 years, Hartigan meets a grown up Nancy (Jessica Alba of 'Honey') and discovers that the sex deviant that he thought he had dealt with is back for more skullduggery. In the third, an indestructible private eye, Dwight (Clive Owen of 'King Arthur'), intervenes between trigger-happy policemen and a horde of gun-toting hookers led by sexy prostitute Gail (Rosario Dawson of 'Kids') after a corrupt cop (Benicio Del Toro of 'Traffic') is gunned down. Wrapped around these three unsavory sagas is another yarn about a deceptive looking hit-man (Josh Harnett of 'Pearl Harbor') who never misses his mark.The story goes that the Directors Guild of America busted Rodriguez out of their union because he gave co-director's credit to comic book artist Frank Miller. According to Rodriguez, Miller's artwork provided him with a storyboard to follow, so he considered Miller as his collaborator. Miller didn't physically direct any of the scenes. Meanwhile, Quentin Tarantino called the shots on a scene or two, but his contribution is so seamlessly integrated into the whole that it doesn't call attention to itself. Although the bulk of the mayhem appears in sharply drawn black and white, Rodriguez dabbles with other colors occasionally, such as red for women's lips or blue for a woman's eyes. Occasionally, characters bleed in different colors. For example, the pedophile bleeds yellow blood. Nothing in 'Sin City' is remotely believable, but credibility was never Rodriguez's the goal for this high-octane, slam-bang shoot'em up. The heroes behave acceptably heroic and sometimes die for their heroism. The villains emerge as repellent as you will find in any gritty action thriller. Mickey Rourke's Marv, who resembles Kirk Douglas from 'Spartacus' on a lifetime supply of steroids, qualifies as the most memorable character. British actor Clive Owen proves his credentials as a cool action hero. A variety of familiar faces pop up in some of the least expected roles. 'Lord of the Rings' hero Elijah Wood plays a Hannibal Lector-like cannibal/serial killer. Audiences that crave action movies with girls, guts, and gore will find this glossy black and white tribute to Frank Miller's graphic novels and film noir thrillers of yesteryear engrossing.",10,1,2,17 June 2007
The Ugly Truth," The Hilarious Truth!
","'Legally Blonde' director Robert Luketic's latest movie 'The Ugly Truth' qualifies as the ideal date movie. This giddy, lightweight, battle-of-the-sexes, romantic comedy about polar opposites pitted against each other, Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl, has chemistry to burn, and the chemistry is incendiary! Mind you, the narrative conceit of opposites attracting is as ancient as the Harold Lloyd silent comedy 'Girl Shy' (1924) and 'The Ugly Truth' is just as predictable. Recent examples of similar romantic comedies include 'What Women Want,' 'Maid in Manhattan,' 'Failure to Launch,' 'Sweet Home Alabama,' and 'You've Got Mail.' Nevertheless, the Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz, and Kristin Smith screenplay works like a charm, particularly because the leads, Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl, play such charismatic characters. Butler displays a genuine knack for comedy, while Heigl shows no shame when she makes a buffoon of herself. Indeed, Heigl acted as an executive producer, and that is saying a lot after you see the hilarious scenes at the baseball park and in the restaurant.Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl of '27 Dresses') is a smart, capable, good-looking, blonde television producer of a local Sacramento morning talk show with less-than-spectacular ratings. She is also controlling and manipulative and hasn't been on an exciting date for eleven months. In other words, she's got man problems, the kind of man problems that mean she doesn't have a man around when she needs him. Abby and her assistant Joy (Bree Turner of 'Joe Dirt') do research on every guy that our heroine dates. When she goes out on a date, Abby has already run a background check on the guy. Furthermore, she comes with a list of topics to discuss in case the conversation dries up. Predictably, at the end of an evening, Abby winds up walking herself back to her apartment.Abby is about to go to sleep when her cute pet cat D'Artagnan mashes the remote control and changes the channel to a 'live' public access cable program called 'The Ugly Truth.' Abby cannot believe her ears as the unshaven chauvinistic male host sets fire to three bestsellers about dating and relationships in a barbecue grill. Mike Chadaway (Gerard Butler of '300') epitomes the typical, politically incorrect, shock-jock host who speaks plainly about men, women, and sex. According to Mike, men hate to hear about a gal's problems, they only want oral sex. Abby phones him up and informs him that men are sensitive, too. When he asks her about her current boyfriend, she lapses into silence. Mike labels her 'Lassie' and cuts her off.The next morning at work, Abby is shocked when her boss, Stuart (Nick Searcy of 'Runaway Jury'), announces that he has hired Mike Chadaway to boost their sagging ratings. Initially, Abby hates the idea, but she perseveres. Stuart, who fears for Abby's job and his son's college tuition, persuades Abby to give Mike a chance. Not surprisingly, Mike wins them high ratings. Abby tells him about her next door neighbor, Colin (Eric Winter of the soaper 'Days of Our Lives'), an orthopedic surgeon with a body like a Chippendale dancer. Mike bets her he can show her how to win the guy or he'll quit the show. Abby agrees and Mike begins what looks like the modern day equivalent of 'Pygmalion.' Mike takes Abby out to buy new outfits, longer hair, and tells her to stop behaving like a psycho control freak. He teaches Abby how to hang up on a guy and know if he is going to call back. Abby is flabbergasted when everything that Mike tells her to do works. Mike's magic not only works on Abby, but also the couple that hosts Abby's morning talk show, Georgia (Cheryl Hines of 'Along Came Polly') and Larry (John Michael Higgins of 'Yes Man') who having been hitting off lately. Basically, they are unhappily married because she earns more money and she won't let him be the man.Eventually, all the coaching that Mike gives Abby and their constant bickering with each other takes a toll of their at-arms-length relationship and the ice cracks in ways that you wouldn't expect. Mike is being courted by the networks and he gets an audition on the 'The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.' Of course, the network loves Mike's personality and he is tempted. Abby and he step on an elevator and things change.Although this harmless fluff carries an R-rating, 'The Ugly Truth' is clever, frivolous, borderline crude but lacks nudity. Sure, some of the subject matter and the language might prove offensive, but this guy-wants-gal, guy-loses-gal, and guy-gets-gal back is infectiously entertaining stuff without a mean-spirit to be found anywhere in its trim 96-minutes. If 'The Hangover' was a good way to get the summer cranked up with a comedy, then 'The Ugly Truth' is a great way to wrap it up with laughs galore.",10,0,7,26 July 2009
Gangs of New York," Too Much 'Gang' For One Bang!
","Director Martin Scorsese's long awaited urban crime saga 'Gangs of New York,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Jim Broadbent, paints a vivid but unsavory picture of ethnic and racial intolerance in 19th century New York City against the bloody Union Draft Riots of 1863. Best known for his cinematic Italian mafia masterpieces: 'Mean Streets' (1973, 'Goodfellas' (1990), and 'Casino' (1995), Scorsese explores the bigotry boiling over between white Anglo-Saxon, Protestant Americans and first-generation Irish immigrant in this costume-clad, period piece. Oscar-winning British actor Daniel Day-Lewis of 'My Left Foot' takes top acting honors as a heavily mustached villain with a stovepipe hat who clashes with Irish good guy DiCaprio of 'Titanic' fame.Scorsese's lengthy 164-minute evocation of New York during the American Civil War gives audiences a glimpse of history that they may have never seen, especially when pugnacious Northerners lynch African-Americans. If Scorsese's politically incorrect posture isn't galling enough, he allows one of New York City worst criminals, Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed (British actor Jim Broadbent of 'The Avengers') to emerge as a somewhat likable though thoroughly unscrupulous fellow. Like virtually all Scorsese movies, 'Gangs of New York' relies on a narrator to fill in the gaps of the film's sprawling exposition.'Gangs of New York' opens one snowy morning in 1846 with a ferocious fistfight between William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his chief rival 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson of 'Star Wars: Episode One') for control over New York's Lower East Side. Cutting heads up a gang of proud Nativists. Not only do they hate the Irish, but also they despise freed African-Americans. During the savage battle of Five Points, as their fracas becomes known, Cutting carved up Vallon while Vallon's son Amsterdam watches. Afterward, Amsterdam winds up in an orphanage. When he leaves the orphanage some 16 years later, Vallon returns to Five Points to square accounts with Cutting. New York City consists largely of tribal gangs, while corrupt public officials, like corrupt public officials, like the infamous Boss Tweed, dominate municipal affairs. Eventually, Cutting accepts Amsterdam as one of his own, and Amsterdam ascends the ladder of success. He becomes Bill's second in charge. Pretty pickpocket Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz of 'There's Something About Mary') catches the eyes of both Amsterdam and his old pal Johnny Sirocco (Henry Thomas of 'E.T.') but never comes between them for the worse. Imagine Bill's surprise when he learns Amsterdam is the Priest's son.Thinly etched characters and obvious plot contrivances dilute the less than compelling screenplay by film critic Jay Cocks of 'The Age of Innocence,' Steve Zaillian of 'Schindler's List,' and Kenneth Lonergan of 'Analyze This.' Never should the villain eclipse the hero as 'Butcher Bill' does Amsterdam! The writers develop their villain with greater substance, stature, and ambiguity. Meanwhile, DiCaprio's shallow, one-dimensional Irish hero blends into the background. Simply said, Day-Lewis Cutting radiates more charisma than Amsterdam. After Amsterdam infiltrates Cutting's ranks, the two adversaries behave like father and son. Amsterdam's 'Hamlet' like indecision to kill Bill bogs down the action. Desperately, the writers turn up the heat in a contrived romantic subplot between DiCaprio's Amsterdam and Diaz's Jenny to compensate for their colorless hero.Basically, 'Gangs' resembles a Spaghetti western with its revenge story set east of the Mississippi River. Incidentally, Scorsese lensed this lavishly produced opus on the back lot of Rome's legendary Cinecitta Studios with 19th century New York City recreated at the cost of $110 million dollars. Ambitious, provocative, off-beat, but excessively long, 'Gangs of New York ranks more as a triumph of set design and period detail, not overlooking Day-Lewis' exceptional, Oscar-worthy performance as the villain, than an exciting showdown between two titans.",6,1,1,30 August 2007
Windtalkers," There's No Wow to this Woo Saga
","Clichés fly like shrapnel in the violent, often explosive World War II combat epic 'Windtalkers,' co-starring big-screen action icons Nicolas Cage & Christian Slater. As staged by veteran Hong Kong action maestro John Woo, this exciting but unexceptional patriotic tribute to the Navajo Indian radio operators whose native tongue provided a code that the Japanese couldn't crack gives the short shrift not only to the tribe but also history. The uninspired John 'Blown Away' Rice & Joe 'Chasers' Batteer screenplay suffers from a bad case of battle fatigue and furnishes little insight into why the military chose the Navajo language. Of course, Hollywood doesn't spend millions to make historically accurate tales because distorting the facts drums up greater dramatic impact. Nevertheless, despite its graphic depiction of war, 'Windtalkers' treats the Navajo code as a disposable plot device to enliven its mediocre melodramatics.Nicolas Cage's empathic performance as a conscientious Marine non-com, however, manages to bolster this odd-fashioned, formulaic fodder. Cage plays twice decorated Marine Corps. Sergeant Joe Enders who survived the sanguinary campaign in the Solomon Islands in 1942 with a perforated eardrum and winds up in a comfortable Hawaiian hospital. Sympathetic U.S. Navy nurse Rita Swelton (Francis O'Conner of 'Bedazzled') helps Enders fool his physicians into clearing him for combat when he really cannot hear as well with his damaged left ear as he pretends. After he resumes active duty, Enders finds himself ordered to act as a bodyguard for Navajo radio code talker Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach of 'Flags of Our Fathers'), but there is a catch. Ender's superiors warn him that he must take his Navajo buddy's life if it ever appears that Yahzee might fall into the hands of the enemy. Meanwhile, Sergeant Pete 'Ox' Anderson (Christian Slater of 'True Romance') teams up with Ben's Navajo buddy Charlie Whitehorse (real-life Navajo Roger Willie of 'Adaptation') as the Leathernecks land on the Jap-infested island of Saipan in the last days of the Pacific war.Incredibly, 'Windtalkers' concentrates more on Cage's traumatized Italian-American Marine sergeant than on either of the Navajos or the code itself. Of course, neither Adam Beach nor Charlie Whitehorse has an adequate marquee value compared to Cage. Nevertheless, why couldn't Cage have played a code talker? Furthermore, the filmmakers chronicle nothing of singular significance about the bloody Saipan campaign in their two-hour plus guts, gore, and glory saga. Aside from the Cage character, neither scripters John Rice nor John Batteer make any of the character more than one-dimensional ciphers. About the only thing that Rice and Batteer avoid is giving their cookie-cutter character the obligatory speeches that sabotaged Steven Spielberg's hopelessly sentimental 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) and Terence Malick's pompous art house pabulum 'The Thin Red Line' (1998).Audiences that crave gory, blood-splattered heroics will get this fill. Woo blows up trucks, jeeps, tanks, and artillery galore with his usual exuberant fireball abandon when he isn't blasting soldiers to bits. These violent scenes have been orchestrated with typical Woo panache and serve as textbook examples of how to handle violence. Perhaps the only thing that distinguishes 'Windtalkers' is its politically incorrect treatment of the Japanese enemy. Ironically, director John Woo portrays them the way that Hollywood westerns once exploited Native Americans as anonymous savages.",6,0,1,8 March 2008
Spectre," Not As Good As 'Skyfall' But Better Than 'Casino Royale'
","The 24th entry in the James Bond film franchise, Oscar-winning 'American Beauty' director Sam Mendes's 'Spectre,' tops 'Casino Royale' (2006) and 'Quantum of Solace' (2008), but it doesn't surpass 'Skyfall' (2012). Ultimately, despite a variety of problems, this globe-trotting 007 outing boasts enough good stuff to offset the bad. If picturesque settings, robust performances, sumptuous production values, and a lavish $250 million plus budget constituted the bottom line for a cinematic blockbuster, 'Spectre' would rank as the best ever Bond. Unfortunately, several factors undermine 'Spectre,'including Sam Smith's mellow theme song, sophomoric scripting, lackluster villains, and a sluggish 148 minute running time. The above-average but formulaic screenplay by 'Gladiator's' John Logan, regular Bond scribes Neal Purvis & Robert Wade, and 'Edge of Tomorrow's' Jez Butterworth generates occasional spontaneity. The scenes depicting a brawl aboard a helicopter and later on an aircraft crashing into a convoy of vehicles amount to exciting milestones for the series. The car chase through Rome is thoroughly routine, and the fistfight above the train is more noisy than dangerous. Furthermore, the basic plot recalls the Tom Cruise espionage epic 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' where the CIA sought to disband the IMF. One of Bond's secondary opponents dreams and schemes about dismantling the double-O section, putting our protagonist out to pasture, and relying on a global satellite surveillance network to thwart terrorism. Despite these drawbacks and letdowns, 'Spectre' benefits from an incomparable supporting cast. Ralph Fiennes distinguishes himself as Bond's new boss, M, while Ben Whishaw as Bond's quartermaster extraordinaire, Q, has more time to display his skills. Former wrestler David Bautista acquits himself admirably as Blofeld's chief thug, while Jesper Christensen is a hold-over from 'Casino Royale' and 'Quantum of Solace.' If you're a Bond fan, you'll appreciate the homages to 'From Russia with Love,' 'You Only Live Twice,' 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' 'The Spy Who Loved Me,' 'For Your Eyes Only,' and 'License to Kill.' Naturally, Daniel Craig returns as pugnacious 007, and he guns down a score of hooligans, beds a couple of babes, and swaps blows with the biggest hulk of a henchman since Roger Moore's Bond grappled with Richard Kiel's humongous Jaws. 'Spectre' unfolds in Mexico City during the annual Day of the Dead festivities. James Bond has been shadowing Marco Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona of 'Malèna'), and he discovers Sciarra and his cronies plan to explode a bomb in a crowded nearby stadium. Mind you, the new M (Ralph Fiennes of 'Skyfall') didn't send Bond to pursue this dastard. Instead, 007 received a posthumous video from the former M (Judi Dench of 'GoldenEye') about Sciarra. In the event of her death, M instructs Bond to kill Sciarra and attend his funeral. Bond tails Sciarra to Mexico City and eavesdrops on a conversation before Sciarra's conspirators spot him. A harrowing shoot-out ensues. One of Bond's bullets ignites the bomb, and the explosion collapses half a city block, with 007 narrowly escaping death. Predictably, M is furious about the international incident that Bond has precipitated. Of course, Bond says little about his reasons for killing Sciarra. Later, Bond sneaks off to Rome against orders to confabulate with Sciarra's widow Lucia (Monica Bellucci of 'Shoot'em Up'), and he gate crashes a gangster summit. He runs afoul of the nefarious Mr. Hinx (David Bautista of 'Guardians of the Galaxy') who pursues him. Simultaneously, M tangles with the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service, smarmy Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott of the BBC's 'Sherlock'), who has merged MI5 and MI6. Denbigh wants to scrap the double-0 section and replace it with a Babel-like global satellite surveillance system codenamed 'Nine Eyes.' Although Denbigh has the ear of the Home Secretary, something about the mysterious conglomeration of private backers who financed his project bothers M. Meantime, Bond races off to rescue another damsel, Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux of 'Blue Is the Warmest Color'), who identifies the criminal organization that Bond has been investigating as 'Spectre.' If you haven't seen Daniel Craig's earlier James Bond escapades, you may be baffled by some of the events and characters. Not only does 'Spectre' bring a sense of closure to Craig's previous Bonds, but it also reunites our redoubtable hero with his career-long nemesis—Ernst Stavro Blofeld. For the record, James Bond has been contending with Blofeld as far back as the original Sean Connery 007 epics in the 1960s. Although we didn't see Blofeld in 'Dr. No,' we caught glimpses of him with his white cat in 'From Russia with Love' and 'Thunderball.' Finally, Blofeld appeared in plain sight in 'You Only Live Twice,' 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' 'Diamonds Are Forever,' and 'Never Say Never Again.' We got a glimpse of him again in 'For Your Eyes Only,' but 'Spectre' represents the first time since 'Never Say Never Again' that Blofeld has stepped into the limelight. Oscar-winning character actor Christoph Waltz of 'Inglourious Basterds' comes out of the shadows and confronts Bond late in the third quarter of 'Spectre.' Waltz makes a terrific villain, but Mendes and his scripters have short-changed him on screen time. Blofeld's final infamy sends Bond scrambling frantically in search of the plucky heroine at the old MI 6 building poised to be blown to smithereens. This ticking time bomb scene recalls the finale of the Sylvester Stallone movie 'Expendables 3.' Sadly, unlike a traditional James Bond movie, 'Spectre' furnishes 007 with few ingenious gadgets. He is reduced to wearing a wristwatch that comes with an alarm clock bomb. Most of Blofeld's staff consists of executives or clerical staff, and Blofeld's gunmen are terrible shots. It is only when the end credits roll that we learn the name of Blofeld's chief henchman that David Bautista portrays. Mr. Hinx should have lasted longer than he does. Indeed, he should have shown up for the finale in the MI 6 building, so he could prevent Bond from escaping with Madeleine Swann. Altogether, 'Spectre' lacks sufficient spectacle to overshadow 'Skyfall.'",8,4,12,10 November 2015
Coach Carter," 'Coach Carter' makes the grade!!!
","Every conscientious high school educator ought to watch the new hoops movie 'Coach Carter,' (*** out of ****) an inspirational but formulaic, true-life sports saga about a messianic basketball coach that recycles elements from the 1987 Gene Hackman netter 'Hoosiers' and the 1989 Morgan Freeman classic 'Lean On Me.' Not only does Samuel L. Jackson deliver a powerful performance, but also Coach Ken Carter's real-life exploits provide him with his most charismatic role since the 1995 Bruce Willis police thriller 'Die Hard With a Vengeance.' Moreover, Jackson doesn't have to shoot, stab, or slay anybody to hold our attention. Okay, he roughs up a haughty high school student, but Jackson's suit & tie clad character restraints his temper. After all, he serves as their role model, rather like Denzel Washington in 'Remember the Titans.' The biggest difference between 'Coach Carter' and the aforementioned films is Carter demands that his team sign a contract that pledges them to maintain a 2.3 grade point average. When our hero discovers that several players are flunking out, Carter padlocks the gym and forfeits the next game, even though he has transformed the Oilers into an undefeated Cinderella phenomenon. Suddenly, stunned parents and teachers who've grown accustomed to their team winning contend that Carter is unreasonably depriving their students of a golden opportunity obtain scholarships from scouts to attend nearby colleges.'Coach Carter' preaches its loud, obvious but admirable message without short-changing the audience when it comes time to entertain them. The disciplinary scenes where Carter whips his students into shape recall the 1967 Lee Marvin World War II blockbuster 'The Dirty Dozen.' Interestingly, too, another message emerges from this fast-paced, often exciting, but flawed feel-good saga. Even more controversial than Carter's decision to bench the team is a young female character's (the big-screen debut of singer Ashanti) decision to terminate her pregnancy when her boyfriend, Kenyon (Rob Brown of 'Finding Forrester'), and she both realize they cannot raise a family and attend college at the same time. Incredibly, the academic excellence message overshadows the abortion subplot. Sometimes, what people pay attention to reveals as much about themselves as an audience than the movie itself. Moreover, critics have either overlooked or bypassed this incendiary issue. Nobody gets really upset with the abortion subplot. Instead, the parents, teachers, and administrators howl about Carter's audacious scheme to bench the team until they can hike their Q.P.A. to a level acceptable for acceptance at a junior college.Biographies like 'Coach Carter' tend to degenerate into saintly hero-worship, because--unless the person is dead--the studio doesn't want to worry about a lawsuit for character assassination. Despite this ever-present fear, director Thomas Carter, who helmed 'Save The Last Dance For Me,' wrings convincing performances out of a largely unknown cast. There's chemistry between Jackson and his twentysomething co-stars, and the Mark ('The Perfect Score) Schwahn and John ('Varsity Blues') Gatins screenplay provides us with many suspenseful moments off court as well as on the court. Sure, the subplots surrounding the team building scenes are riddled with clichés, but the persuasive performances give you a reason to overlook these staples.'Coach Carter' is pretty straightforward and takes places over a span of four months back in 1998. The action occurs at Richmond High School in California where the basketball teamthe Oilerscompiled a losing record of 4 wins and 22 losses. In frustration, the coach convinces Carter to take on the coaching job without pay. As it turns out, Carter attended Richmond as a teen and set All-American basketball records that nobody has topped. At first, the students balk at the rigid conditions that he sets down for them to follow if they want to play. Not only must they wear suits and ties to school, but also they must sit on the front row of their classes. One arrogant student, Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzales of 'Biker Boyz') storms out in a rage. Later, after he sees Carter work his magic and convert the team into contenders, he begs his way back into the fold. Purists will argue that the film presents all the usual stereotypes of inner-city, at-risk minority youths. Essentially, this is an accurate way of looking at 'Coach Carter.' Samuel L. Jackson dominates the film with his bossy character, and the movie sizzles when he appears on screen. Meanwhile, all the subplots except the abortion date back 1970's blaxploitation thrillers.The worst thing about 'Coach Carter' is director Thomas Carter's (no relation to the protagonist) strategy to downplay academics. Understandably, the visual dynamics of taking tests and attaining high grades present few photogenic possibilities compared with adrenalin-laced action on the basketball court. Indeed, Carter stages the on-court action with skill, and you get caught up in the team's determination to win against long odds, especially in the final championship showdown. Aside from its commendable message, 'Coach Carter' succeeds where other recent sports dramas, like the lackluster 'Friday Night Lights,' flounder. Samuel L. Jackson's memorable performance, the white-knuckled tension during the basketball games, and a sturdy supporting cast overcoming their stereotypical roles helps 'Coach Carter' make the grade.",Null,0,1,2 February 2005
True Romance," Tarantino At His Tops with Tony
","'Top Gun' director Tony Scott pulls out all stops in 'True Romance,' a wonderfully lyrical, but abrasive crime thriller that opens in frigid, snowy Detroit, migrates to warm, sunny Los Angeles, and then concludes on a sandy beach in Mexico. 'Beverly Hills Cop ' lenser Jeffrey L. Kimball is such a gifted cinematographer that he makes everything in this off-beat romantic actioneer look picture postcard gorgeous and Scott orchestrates the shoot-outs for maximum impact. You will see a lot of Dutch tilt angles in 'True Romance' to capture the dangerous, topsy-turvy hi-jinks. While Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the leaders, the producers have surrounded them with a superlative supporting cast, and Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances in a rather slight role as a slacker who lives on a couch. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Val Kilmer as Elvis flesh out the film. Further, Scott has assembled a variety of songs both popular and classical that do as much to enliven the atmosphere of a scene as the cinematography. The editing on the roller-coaster scene is nothing short of spectacular. Like any Tarantino-directed movie, 'True Romance' contains myriad references to pop culture, especially Elvis Presley, Sonny Chiba, Charles Bronson, 'Star Trek's' Captain Kirk, and John Woo's Hong Kong actioneers, with profanity galore. The story follows the misadventures of a young, twentysomething drifter from Detroit and his wife--a reformed prostitute--as they head out to Hollywood to sell a suitcase bulging with cocaine and then ride off into the sunset.Clarence Worley (Christian Slater of 'Heathers') works at a comic book store, Heroes for Sale, and every year during his birthday he attends a Sonny Chiba triple feature. Tonight he encounters the woman of his dreams, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) and spends an eventful night with her. Initially, Alabama plans to leave Clarence, but she cannot compose a letter and gets no farther than 'Dear Clarence.' Later, Clarence learns that Alabama is a 'call girl' and his boss paid for her. Nevertheless, Clarence and Alabama falls hopelessly in love and venture downtown the next day to wed. They have matching tattoos inked into their bodies. Clarence asks Alabama about her things that she left where she worked as a prostitute. Our blonde heroine tries to dissuade Clarence from dropping in on her former pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman of 'Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead'), so he can retrieve her things. Meantime, Clarence's idol, the late Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer of 'Top Gun') advises Clarence on his options. What makes Elvis' appearances cool is that you catch only glimpses of his face, you see his body only making those characteristic Elvis' moves. Usually, Elvis—called the 'Mentor' in the screen credits—talks to Clarence when our hero is in the bathroom.Clarence is determined that he must severe any ties between Alabama's old boss and her new way of life. A gunfight erupts at Drexl's place and Clarence survives miraculously. He orders a hooker to give him Alabama's suitcase. What he gets is a ton of cocaine. Ironically, the suitcase has an anti-narcotics bumper sticker on it. Earlier, Drexl double-crossed some associates and stole the suitcase from them. Thus begins Clarence's odyssey. Alabama and he head out for Los Angeles, but before they blow out of town, Clarence checks in on his divorced father Clifford Worley (Dennis Hopper of 'True Grit') to see if the authorities know anything about Drexl's death. Clifford clears any doubts that Clarence has so Alabama and he pile into his pink convertible Cadillac and take off for California to meet his old friend Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport of 'Zebrahead'), an aspiring actor with an audition for the new 'T.J. Hooker.' Predictably, Dick doesn't know what to say when he sees all the coke. Nevertheless, he is frustrated that Clarence thinks that he has connections in the Hollywood industry to unload the cocaine.Meanwhile, after Clarence and Alabama leave, the Sicilian mob comes a-calling, and Clifford meets Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken of 'The Deer Hunter') who tells him all about Clarence and the stolen narcotics. Of course, Clifford doesn't believe a word of it, but Coccotti wants to know where his product is so he tortures Clifford. He starts out by slashing his hand. One of the best scenes in 'True Romance' has Clifford telling off Coccotti with a politically incorrect yarn about why Italians in southern Italy no longer have blue eyes and blond hair. Tarantino has gone on record saying that he got this fanciful story from an African-American friend. The bit of classical music that is set against Clifford's history lesson is stunning. Naturally, Coccotti isn't amused when Clifford calls him 'an egg-plant.' Anyway, Clifford refuses to divulge the whereabouts of Clarence and Alabama, and Coccotti blasts him at point blank range with a revolver. Attired in a topcoat with a scarf, Coccotti resembles a priest about to administer last rites. No sooner have they executed Clifford than a mobster finds a note attached to the fridge and provides them with Clarence's contact information in Hollywood. The dramatic irony of this revelation and Clifford's decision to sacrifice himself for his son is quite striking.In Hollywood, Dick introduces our heroes to Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot of 'Beverly Hills Cop') who serves as a assistant to movie mogul Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek of 'Unforgiven') and Clarence convinces Lee to buy the coke. Eventually, the Detroit mob hits Los Angeles and they come gunning for Clarence, with one of Coccotti's henchmen, Virgil (James Gandolfini of 'The Sopranos'), taking an interest in Alabama. The fight between Alabama and Virgil is one of the most violent scenes and she celebrates her victory in a chant of primal ecstasy that makes her look like Tarzan.'True Romance' is a fantastic movie with memorable dialogue worth quoting. The protagonists are both young and sympathetic. Christian Slater will never play another character as likable as Clarence Worley.",10,3,4,30 August 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Bravo, Danny Boyle!
","British director Danny Boyle, best known for 'Trainspotting' and 'The Beach,' has made the rags-to-riches feel-good film of the year with 'Slumdog Millionaire.' Mind you, Indian co-director Loveleen Tandan, who served as a second unit director on 'Monsoon Wedding' (2001), helped Boyle out. Set in contemporary India, this winsome tale about three dirt-poor orphans who rise above abject squalor and poverty to attain their most outlandish dreams of romance and riches qualifies as modern day Charles Dickens morality play. Indeed, you could also compare 'Slumdog Millionaire' to those vintage 1930s' Warner Brothers crime classics where one kid plunges down the wrong path while the other takes the right path. Ultimately, the brothers here find themselves at odds with each other on different sides of the law. The bad people are punished in 'Slumdog,' while the good people are rewarded. 'Full Monty' scenarist Simon Beaufoy based his lively script on diplomat-turned-novelist Vikas Swarup's first book, 'Q & A,' about an Indian waiter who was arrested for cheating on a quiz show. Don't let the foreign oriented storyline discourage you from enjoying this inspirational yarn. Boyle provides interesting, off-beat looking subtitles for the Hindu dialogue, but the cast deliver most of the lines in English. If you're looking for a change of pace, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is just the ticket. As upbeat and optimistic as 'Slumdog' is, prepare yourself for some scenes that may make you wince. 'Slumdog' deserved its R-rating as much as it deserved his Best Picture Oscar. This movie is far more entertaining than the imaginative but long-winded Brad Pitt epic 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.' Basically, 'Slumdog Millionaire' concerns the coincidences that land a teenage Muslim refugee from the Bombay slums, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), on the Indian equivalent of the ABC-TV show 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire.' Since he is a product of the slums, our long-suffering hero is regarded with considerable suspicion. Jamal keeps surprising the slimy quiz show host Prem Kumar (veteran Bollywood actor Anil Kupoor) with one correct answer after another and the jealous Kumar turns him over to the authorities. Kumar is convinced that Jamal is a cheater. Kumar is far from saintly himself and doesn't want Jamal to steal his glory. It seems Kumar's meteoric rise in show business came about as a result of giving the right answers on a game show. At the outset, 'Slumdog' creates suspense for audiences with the important question: 'Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees. How did he do it? A. He cheated. B. He's lucky. C. He's a genius. D. It is written.' Indeed, Jamal is poised to win more wealth that he can possibly imagine when the police subject him to a night of torture. They beat him up and finally attach jumper cables to his toes to make him confess. Our stubborn hero refuses to capitulate. The chief police investigator, Irfan Khan (Irrfan Khan), finds it difficult to believe that a kid from the slums could know so much.Boyle's strategy in 'Slumdog' is to alternate each unusual question that our beleaguered hero answers with an episode from his traumatic life that relates to each question. The scene when Jamal plunges into an outdoors toilet, covering himself from head-to-toe in human feces, so he can obtain an autograph from his favorite movie superstar is hilarious. Actually, the fecal matter consisted of peanut butter and chocolate. (This scene is reminiscent of a similar episode from 'Trainspotting' where an Edinburgh junkie dives into a toilet to retrieve a narcotic suppository.) During his youth, Jamal and his brother Salim (Madhur Mital) encounter some genuinely sleazy characters, especially one unsavory fellow who likes to 'rescue' orphans from the streets so that he can turn them into beggars. This part of 'Slumdog' may remind you of Charles Dickens's second novel 'Oliver Twist.' Anyway, this scoundrel likes to blind small children and send them out to beg and sing for money. Jamal and Salim escape from this life, but in doing so, Jamal abandons--against his will--a girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto) for whom he has sworn his undying love. Of course, the evil child exploiter sells Latika to men who want to see her dance. Hmm, I wonder what the Indian Tourist Bureau thinks about this saga. Ten years ago, 'Slumdog' would have taken place in Brazil. Suffice to say that the hero and heroine are separated with little chance of being reunited. Happily, however, 'Slumdog' takes several astonishing twists and turns before fade-out that will surprise you, and ultimately make you feel good, perhaps even great, depending on how much you love fairy tales.Although it runs two hours in length, 'Slumdog Millionaire' never wastes a second. Boyle and Tandan turn this helter-skelter saga into a roller-coaster. As a glimpse of India, 'Slumdog' is enlightening as well as horrifying. If nothing else, you'll learn to never shed your shoes around the Taj Mahal. The casting of our heroes from adolescence to teenagers is nothing short of brilliant. This is no Hollywood hokum where the children look nothing like the adults. Jamal follows the straight and narrow after Salim and he indulge in juvenile delinquency that recalls the shenanigans of the Jewish kids in Sergio Leone's gangster classic 'Once Upon a Time in America.' You won't forget 'Slumdog Millionaire.' The irony of all this is 'Slumdog,' which received 8 Oscars as well as two more Oscar nominations, almost wound up going straight to DVD because nobody believed it could recoup its $15 million budget. At this point, 'Slumdog' has coined over $116 million dollars!",10,2,5,4 March 2009

Mad Max: Fury Road," Max Is Back with Max Action
","Moviegoers old enough to remember the 1980s may cherish memories of those gonzo, post-apocalyptic, B-movies where humans struggled to survive in either an urban or desert wasteland against gloomy odds. Those low-budget, R-rated, schlock sagas with gladiatorial looking psychotic freaks careening around in beatnik-style buggies straight out of an auto graveyard were both 'drive-in' movie and VHS favorites. These lowbrow actioneers were definitely an acquired taste. Exploitation classics like '1990: The Bronx Warriors,' 'Warriors of the Wasteland,' '2019 - After the Fall of New York,' 'Exterminators Of The Year 3000,' and 'Warrior of the Lost World' proliferated during the 80s after 'Max Mad' surprised Hollywood and generated a market for this violent, slam-bang, dystopian nihilism. According to DVD Times, ''Mad Max' was shot on a budget of 400,000 Australian Dollars, which is a tiny budget for such an action packed film. Up until 'Blair Witch' it held the record for greatest profit to budget ratio (It grossed $100 million USD eventually).' Not only did director George Miller make a superstar out of Mel Gibson with 'Mad Max' (1979), but he also ushered in the grungy, low-class, genre that eventually inspired big-budget replicas. Does anybody remember Kevin Costner's 'Waterworld?' The studio that produced 'Waterworld' sought to remake 'Mad Max,' but they wanted to stage it on the high seas. Thirty years after he wrapped the third entry in the 'Mad Max' trilogy with 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' (1985), George Miller has revived the post-nuke warrior in 'Mad Max: Fury Road' with Tom Hardy taking over Mel Gibson's role. About four years ago, Paul Miller—a Michigan native no relation to George—helmed a fan film 'Mad Max Renegade' that filled in the gap between the first 'Mad Max' and 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.' If you aren't a 1980s movie aficionado, you may have trouble appreciating 'Mad Max: Fury Road' with Charlize Theron taking star billing over Tom Hardy. When we first see Max (Tom Hardy of 'The Dark Knight Rises'), he is standing with his back to the camera on a craggy zenith overlooking a parched desert. In voice over narration, he explains that he used to be a policeman. Furthermore, he reveals that his past still haunts him as much as his doubtful future troubles him. An agile two-headed lizard makes the mistake of scuttling too close, and Max gobbles it down. No sooner has he climbed back into his car and driven off than a phalanx of cars pursues him with a vengeance. Max crashes his car, and his dastardly captors take him to an unspecified place in the desert where a collection of buttes towers over the rugged terrain. This place is known as 'the Citadel.' My chief complaint about this spectacular looking, souped-up, action thriller is the lack of information not only about our resourceful hero but also the people and places in it. The lunatic mutants who shanghai Max are called 'Warboys.' These bare-chested brigands cavort about in trousers and boots and have painted torsos flour-white from the waist up. Clean-shaven skulls complete their ghoulish appearance. They worship a sadistic tyrannical , Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne of the original 'Mad Max'), who decks himself out in a plastic outfit with what appear to be oxygen hoses sprouting from a grotesque face mask with a billows on his shoulders. Miller never divulges why Joe relies on such a macabre apparatus. Joe rules from one of the buttes and controls the water supply. 'Do not become addicted to water,' he warns, 'it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence.' Meantime, he maintains a harem of young, curvaceous, Victoria's Secret models with which he procreates while another harem of corpulent cuties yield buckets of breast milk from pumping units in Citadel. Indeed, 'Mad Max Fury Road' is not your conventional, run-of-the-mill, road trip. Joe has constructed an elaborate system of elevators as well as massive tanker trucks that he dispatches to fetch fuel. He has assigned a driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron of 'Monster'), to cruise into the wastelands with an escort of Warboys to replenish their gasoline supply. At the last minute, Furiosa goes rogue and swerves her vehicle off-course into the desert. Initially, her heavily-armed escort believes she is complying with new orders. An alarmed Joe assembles an armada of bizarre vehicles to pursue Furiosa. One of Joe's Warboys, Nux (Nicholas Hoult of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'), desperately wants to commandeer a pursuit vehicle, but he has to take his 'blood bag' with him. Since his capture, Max has suffered with Warboys tattooing his back and suspending him upside down to furnish blood to Nux. During the feverish pursuit of Furiosa, Max manages to escape Nux and negotiates an uneasy truce with our heroine. Max learns Furiosa is searching for her utopian homeland, and a quintet of Joe's wives have chosen to defect and accompany her. One of the harem is poised to give birth, and Joe is incandescent with rage when she shields these treacherous fugitives. Basically, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' amounts to an adrenaline-laced, testosterone-laden, high-octane fantasy boasting outlandish hybrid vehicles and amazing motorcycle aerobatics. The narrative unfolds in an anonymous desert in the distant future. At one point, a gargantuan dust storm teeming with twisters engulfs everybody. Max sits out the early part of the movie as a prisoner in the Citadel. Hardy wears a face mask a little more revealing than the one he sported as the maleficent Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises.' Hardy proves every bit as resilient as Mel Gibson's Max, and he is constantly running a gauntlet. Surprisingly, Charlize Theron steals the show. Although minus part of her left forearm, she brandishes a creepy mechanical contraption that enables her to steer her big rig. Despite its scarcity of exposition, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' qualifies as an entertaining, often surreal, but ultimately fast-paced demolition derby.",9,3,8,26 May 2015
Warcraft," Above-Average But Derivative Sword & Sorcery Saga
","No, I've never played the video game World of Warcraft, but I've seen the $161-million dollar, PG-13 rated, Universal Pictures' extravaganza. What 'Source Code' director Duncan Jones, 'Seventh Son' scenarist Charles Leavitt, and 'Warcraft II & III' video game scribe Chris Metzen have wrought is a larger-than-life, adventure fantasy inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's classic 'Lord of the Rings' and C.S. Lewis' 'Narnia' novels. This sprawling sword & sorcery saga pits terrestrial humans against marauding extraterrestrial Orcs in a cornucopia of striking computer generated images. If you've seen either the trailers or publicity photos for 'Warcraft,' you know those intimidating Orcs resemble Goliath-like humanoids, possess massive limbs, and have a Frank Frazetta look. Tusks bulge improbably from their grim mouths as if they were colossal warthogs. Indeed, these belligerent invaders emerge as mighty gruesome. They wield humongous hammers that would make Thor crap in his drawers, and they abide by a staunch code of honor. Namely, Orcs don't fib. Once they promise something, they adhere to their word. Of course, the Orcs are avatars that unseen but seasoned thespians such as Toby Kebbell, Rob Kazinsky, and Clancy Brown portray in motion capture outfits. Meantime, the humans resemble Arthurian knights adorned in elaborate suits of armor with massive glittering swords. Whereas the Orcs gallivant around on gigantic wolves, the humans cruise the skies astraddle giant Griffins when they aren't riding horses. Aside from Travis Fimmel's sympathetic protagonist Anduin Lothar and Dominic Cooper's noble King Llane Wrynn, 'Warcraft' relies largely on hundreds of CGI characters. What these characters lack in depth, Jones and his special effects wizards compensate for with ghoulish countenances. The filmmakers are not interested in diplomacy as much as they are fascinated with the pugnacious warriors and warlords as they engage in a battle to the death for a little over two hours. This above-average, cinematic adaptation isn't as abhorrent as many critics have claimed, and the narrative ambiguities in 'Warcraft' actually provide it with some surprising depth. Neither Orcs nor humans are entirely either evil or heroic.'Warcraft' chronicles a merciless clash between two vastly different races of warriors. First, director Duncan Jones and his scribes introduce us to the mighty Orcs. Hailing from a dying planet named Draenor, they set out to conquer the planet Azeroth where King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper of 'Need for Speed') of Stormwind presides over a human population living in comparative peace. Those rugged, mesomorphic Orcs march to the orders of a wicked warlock, Gul'dan (voiced by Daniel Wu of 'Europa Report'), who resembles the spawn of Satan with an elaborate thicket of antlers bristling from his back. Gul'dan mobilizes the Orc tribes into an army called the Horde, and he conjures up a colossal trans-dimensional portal. The Orc shaman practices a noxious form of Black magic called the Fel. He deploys the Fel to make the portal operational. The portal derives its power from the life force of captives that the Orcs have imprisoned and transported to Azeroth. This mysterious Fel depletes life energy of those prisoners and their life energy maintains the portal. This portal is reminiscent of the gateways in the vintage sci-fi film 'Stargate' and the television series it spun off that transported individuals from one world to another. The murky green Fel is so toxic that it corrupts anybody and anything, and this malignant force has warped Gul'dan so dreadfully that some of his own kind have come to abhor it. The Orc warrior Durotan (voice of Toby Kebbell of 'Fantastic Four') rules the Frostwolf Clan. As one of the many Draenor tribes, the Frostwolf Clan has joined Gul'dan's Horde. Durotan wants his people, particularly his pregnant wife Draka (voice of Anna Galvin), to thrive as prosperously as they once did before their planet began to deteriorate. Durotan's clan takes its name from the enormous wolves that they ride. Meantime, Durotan doesn't completely trust Gul'dan or the terrible green Fel magic that destroys everything it touches. This generates considerable friction between Durotan and war chieftain Blackhand (voiced by Clancy Brown of 'Highlander'), especially after the latter discovers that the former is plotting treason behind his back. Durotan calls a truce and has words with King Wynn, but Blackhand surprises the two and attacks them. During this wild melee, Stormwind's sorcerer Medivh, (Ben Foster of 'The Mechanic') the legendary Guardian of Tirisfal, saves King Wynn's life by deploying a shield to thwart Blackhand's warriors from slaying him. Unfortunately, King Wynn's army commander Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel of 'Vikings') loses his son, when the young warrior is caught on the wrong side. Not only does Lothar suspect that the Fel has corrupted Medivh, but he also believes that Medivh and Gul'dan may have been conspiring with each other. Anybody who isn't thoroughly acquainted with the mythology of Warcraft may find themselves bewildered by the byzantine stratums of the story. Painstaking research enabled me to clear up who was who in the complex line-up of characters. Indeed, I talked with a seasoned 'Warcraft' gamer who has been playing the Blizzard Entertainment game for over a decade. I watched 'Warcraft' twice before I gained a clear understanding of the hierarchies for both the Horde and Stormwind Alliance. If you've never played Warcraft, the best way to enjoy 'Warcraft' the movie is to savor it simply for both its breathtaking computer generated imagery and interesting combatants. The grotesque Orcs are extremely ugly, while the Stormwind warriors reminded me of King Arthur's knights from the classic movie 'Excalibur.' 'Blood Diamond' scenarist Charles Leavitt and 'Warcraft' game author Chris Metzen gloss over some salient points in the Warcraft universe. Miraculously, director Duncan Jones doesn't let the plethora of exposition take the edge off the savage, testosterone-laden action. He plunges audiences into the stunning CGI imagery with its adrenaline-laced action sequences without drenching us in gallons of blood and gore to compensate for the plot. 'Warcraft' lives up to its title without wearing out its welcome at 123 minutes.",7,8,12,20 June 2016
Gladiator," Caesarean Shlock
","Suffering through 'Gladiator,' director Ridley Scott's long-winded and sloppily staged Roman soldier epic, whetted my appetite for those glorious sword and sandal sagas that Hollywood produced in the 1950s and the 1960s. Guts, gusto, and grandeur distinguished spectacles such as Melvyn Leroy's 'Quo Vadis' (1951), Delmar Daves' 'Demetrius and the Gladiators' (1954), William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur' (1959), Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus' (1960), and Anthony Mann's 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964). Although it borrows bits and pieces from those cinematic classics, 'Gladiator' lacks the passion and charisma which made those movies memorable. Meticulously crafted with stunning, state-of-the-art, digital special effects that recreate ancient Rome, 'Gladiator' chronicles the tragic fate of a valiant general betrayed and enslaved, who returns as a gladiator to wreak vengeance on a wicked emperorWhile brawny Russell Crowe gives a thumbs-up performance, he is defeated by a thumbs-down script that resembles an uninspired rehash of the Clint Eastwood classic 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' in a toga with a chicken-hearted villain and a humdrum finale. The action unfolds in Germania in 180 A.D. General Maximus (Russell Crowe of 'The Insider') wins a brutal battle for his dying emperor, Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris of 'Unforgiven'), against a Danubian horde. Caesar despises his depraved son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix of 'Clay Pigeons') and makes Maximus the protector of Rome. Marcus wants Rome returned to the people and he trust Maximus and Maximus only to make this happen. When Commodus learns the bad news, he suffocates his dear old dad in his tent. At Marcus Aurelius' death bed, Maximus defies Commodus and vows to carry out his late emperor's wishes. Swiftly, Commodus has Maximus arrested and taken out to be executed at dawn. Predictably, Maximus outsmarts his moronic captors and escapes. Riding hard for his sprawling farm in faraway Spain, Maximus arrives too late to save his crucified wife and son. Grief-stricken, he falls prey to a band of slave traders who eventually sell him to Proximo (Oliver Reed of 'Hannibal Brooks'). Not only does Proximo teach Maximus how to survive in the arena, but also how to win the kudos of the crowd.Meanwhile, honoring his father whom he murdered, Commodus revives the gladiator battles in the Coliseum. Proximo shows up with his invincible champion and Commodus gets the shock of his life when he discovers that Maximus is alive. The cheering crowds adore Maximus in the area so the corrupt Commodus plots to kill him outside it.Director Ridley Scott of 'Alien' gums up 'Gladiator' with a soap opera subplot about the incest between Commodus and his sister. The 'Braveheart' style battle that opens the movie is so murky that you can barely see the combatants. The actors in the sun-drenched fights are better, but Scott dwells more on clashing swords rather than hair-raising choreography. Sadly, Commodus makes such a weak, sniveling villain that you feel no relief when Maximus squares accounts with him. Ultimately, as colorless as the statues of the Roman rules, who adorn the palaces in this bloody bore of a blockbuster, 'Gladiator' qualifies as a bust.",5,1,3,9 December 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An Above Average Sequel
","'Transformers' movies can get away with a lot more than most movies. After all, they are cinematic adaptations about a line of extraterrestrial alien robot toys originally made by the Japanese! In 1984, the American toy manufacturer Hasbro obtained the rights to the figures and called them 'Transformers.' Twenty-six years later, the 'Transformers' remain incredibly popular! As the 'Transformers' grew in popularity, they became comic book, television show, and cinematic sensations. Doesn't it tell you something about America when the movie that sells the most tickets features computer-generated versions of humanoid robots? Primarily, the 'Transformers' movies are all about spectacle. Measured by this standard, the new 'Transformers' movie in 3-D is stupendous. Director Michael Bay's third installment in the franchise 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' isn't as obnoxiously farcical as 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.' Instead, this threquel emerges as a little darker than the second movie. This sequel cleverly rewrites history to accommodate its outlandish plot. The war between the Autobots and the Decepticons on the planet Cybertron is drawing to an end when the Autobots launch the Ark. This craft transports a secret cargo known as the Pillars which could enable the good guys to defeat the villains. Unfortunately, the Decepticons blast the Autobot spacecraft, but they don't destroy the vessel. Little do the Decepticons know that the crippled Ark, flown by Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, crashes on the dark side of the Moon when the Cold War is heating up between the United States and the Soviet Union. President John F. Kennedy vows to put a man on the Moon, but secretly he wants the U.S. to beat the Soviets to the mysterious crash site. During the Apollo 11 landing in 1969, NASA gives astronauts Neil Armstrong (Don Jeanes) and Buzz Aldrin (Cory Tucker) about twenty minutes to explore the Ark without letting anybody on Earth--primarily the Soviets--know about it. Armstrong and Aldrin as well as later Apollo missions stockpile artifacts and pictures from the Ark, but nobody knows how to make the best use of them. The scene shifts to the present. Colonel Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and the Autobots are continuing to track down and eliminate the remaining Decepticons. When they visit the notorious Chernobyl disaster site, Autobots Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) uncover fuel cells from the Ark. Actually, the Soviets tried to harness the power of these fuel cells and their efforts triggered the infamous meltdown. As they are investigating Chernobyl, Lennox and the Autobots encounter the Decepticon known as Shockwave (Frank Welker) and another Decepticon. Later, the Autobots confront Secretary of Defense Charlotte Mearing (Frances McDormand) and learn that the Moon race was an effort to recover as much as America could from the Ark. The Autobots fly to the moon. Not only do they find the body of Sentinel Prime in hibernation, but also five Pillars. After Optimus revives Sentinel, his old comrade turns on him and joins a horribly disfigured Megatron and the Decepticons. Sentinel plans to use the Pillars to enslave earthlings. Naturally, like a vintage Republic serial of the 1940s, the Decepticons come to within a hairsbreadth of winning. Not surprising, the architect of their defeat is none other than Sam Witwicky. Life hasn't been kind to Sam since 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.' Although he has graduated from college and received a Medal of Honor from President Obama, Sam hasn't been able to find a job. As 'Dark of the Moon' opens, our frustrated hero is shacked up and living off the generosity of his latest girlfriend, Carly Spencer (newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whitely), while struggling to get a job before his mom and dad arrive in Washington, D.C. If this weren't bad enough, Sam has to contend with Carley's wealthy boss, Dylan Gould (a smarmy Patrick Dempsey) who owns a huge accounting firm as well as his own auto museum. Ironically, Gould helps Sam land a job in the mail room of an aerospace, telecommunications conglomerate. While making his deliveries, Sam bumps into a giddy Asian-American co-worker, Jerry Wang (Ken Jeong of 'The Hangover'), who recognizes Sam and warns him about an imminent Decepticon attack. Sam approaches Defense Secretary Mearing, but she doesn't believe him. Later, she realizes Sam has legitimate information. During a slam-bang finale in Chicago, which supercharges the last hour of this lengthy two hour and thirty minute epic, Sam and his old cronies deal the Decepticons another devastating defeat.'Arlington Road' scenarist Ehren Kruger and Bay have added some new Autobot and Decepticons to enliven the action. The surprises are few and far between, but the best one is Leonard Nimoy. Indeed, Mr. Spock of 'Star Trek' fame furnishes the voice for legendary Autobot leader Sentinel Prime. Oscar winner Frances McDormand joins the cast as a powerful National Security honcho who abhors being addressed as 'm'am.' Sexy Abercrombie & Fitch model Rosie Huntington-Whitely replaces sultry Megan Fox. Huntington-Whitely looks like a Keira Knightley clone. Patrick Dempsey plays the slimy, cynical human villain who aligns himself with the Decepticons, while John Malkovich pops ups in a brief supporting role as a corporate big wig. Meanwhile, virtually everybody else reprises their original roles, including Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and Glenn Morshower. One of the coolest things in 'Dark of the Moon' is the glider suits that military deploy in to fly into a combat zone. The liveliest action set-piece takes place in a skyscraper that is about to collapse as Decepticons pursue our heroes throughout it.As usual these noisy 'Transformers' movies amount to morality lessons. They laud the value of freedom over tyranny, unity between mankind and aliens, and the necessity for a strong military. These toy movies display more red, white, and blue patriotism than most movies and put on the kind of show that would gratify a recruiting officer's heart. The 'Transformers' movies resemble recruiting posters for reckless, adventure-loving lads who want to hurl themselves into the breach.",9,0,4,4 July 2011
The Social Network," The Curious Case of Mark Zuckerberg
","'Fight Club' director David Fincher prefers to make movies about eccentric people. Not only do these folks exist on the fringe, but they are also pretty dysfunctional types. They are lethal serial killers, warped visionaries, baffled authority figures, and bizarre nonconformists. Fincher loves to tackle any genre. His first film was the science-fiction sequel 'Alien 3.' He has helmed two serial killer thrillers, first 'Se7en' (1995) and then in 'Zodiac.' He put an executive through the ringer in 'The Game,' a movie about deception that rivals 'The Sting.' Fincher has even made his own weird 'Forrest Gump' type movie with 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.' Fincher's new film 'The Social Network' could be subtitled 'The Curious Case of Mark Zuckerberg.' This scintillating, insightful, and compelling depiction of the trials and tribulations that Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg endured to make a billion dollar global success of his social-networking website will keep you riveted throughout its 121 engrossing minutes. Watching this movie is like riding an escalator. It never slows down to catch its breath. Mind you, 'The Social Network' qualifies as one of Fincher's shorter movies. Lately, he likes to stretch his cinematic canvas to cover subject matter well over two hours in length. Happily, Fincher doesn't squander a second in 'The Social Network,' and 'Charlie Wilson's War' scenarist Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote episodes of 'The West Wing,' provides crisp, snappy dialogue as well as surprises galore in a screenplay derived from reporter Ben Mezrich's book 'The Accidental Billionaires.' Of course, Fincher and Sorkin cover the biographical basics. Everything started at New England in 2003 and everything went into high gear in California when Facebook entered the orbital velocity. Initially, 'The Social Network' adopts a chronological time line, but Fincher tires quickly of this and leaps into the future and then dances around in time wherever he pleases. There is nothing ordinary about this extraordinary expose, and the way Fincher and Sorkin skewer Facebook's creator as well as many of the people around him is a treat. 'The Social Network' unfolds in 2003 at Harvard University. A nineteen-year-old Harvard sophomore in a GAP hoodie, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg of 'Adventureland'), insults his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara of 'Youth in Revolt'), at a Harvard bar, and she breaks up with him. In a fit of rage, Zuckerberg writes nasty things about her padded bra in his online Internet blog. Indeed, he is so fed up with Erica that he hastily assembles a website while he is getting drunk where anybody can evaluate Harvard co-eds based on their appearance. Zuckerberg gets himself in trouble with the administration because he had to hack the school's computer system to get the names of the co-eds. Zuckerberg's audacious stunt brings him to the attention of two stuck-up jocks, the wealthy Winklevoss twins, Cameron (Armie Hammer of 'Billy: The Early Years') and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer ), as well as Divya Narendra (Max Minghella of 'Agora'), an elite Harvard club member. They hire Zuckerberg to program a Harvard dating site which they want to christen 'The Harvard Connection.' Amusingly enough, actor Armie Hammer plays both identical twin brothers with the help of a body double. Basically, Zuckerberg sees some marginal merit in the Winklevoss twins' idea and modifies it with the help of his close friend and fellow student, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield of 'Never Let Me Go'), a Brazilian who provides an algorithm for Zuckerberg to base the site upon. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg keeps ignoring the Winklevoss twins and builds his new website 'The Facebook' and then expands it to other Ivy League universities. Initially, Eduardo serves as Zuckerberg's business partner and provides the financing. Eventually, Napster creator Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake of 'The Open Road') enters the picture and contacts Zuckerberg. Parker persuades Zuckerberg to relocate to California. Parker also suggests that they drop the 'the' from The Facebook title. Zuckerberg is immediately impressed by the Napster creator and listens to him with more interest than any of his other friends. Not surprisingly, Eduardo and Zuckerberg have a falling out over Parker. Furthermore, Eduardo sees Parker as a mortal enemy who is going to force him out of the picture. Eduardo tries to limit Parker's spell over Zuckerberg by freezing the money in the Facebook account. Nevertheless, Zuckerberg and Parker score a deal for financing and everything proceeds smoothly for Zuckerberg's brain-child. Meantime, the Winklevoss twins and Divya decide to launch a lawsuit against Zuckerberg for allegedly appropriating their dating website and turning it into Facebook. Similarly, Eduardo launches a lawsuit at Zuckerberg because he feels that Parker getting between them. Betrayal emerges as a major theme in this outlandish yarn. When Zuckerberg isn't betraying the goofy Winklevoss twins, he sells out his close friend Eduardo. Later, when Parker goes off the deep end during a Facebook party for bagging their one-millionth customer, Zuckerberg betrays him, too. Ultimately, Zuckerberg loses the lawsuits, but the payments are so minuscule that he can pay off both the Winklevoss twins as well as Eduardo.Unmistakably, 'The Social Network' is Jesse Eisenberg's best movie, and the role seems tailored to his brand of quirky, fast-talking shtick. He delivers an accomplished performance as an obtuse nobody who wound up hooking up a billion people around the world without hooking himself up. Zuckerberg emerges from 'The Social Network' as a dishonorable individual afflicted by a single-minded ambition as well as greed. He refuses to share anything with anybody and ends up paying the price for his perfidy. Future 'Spider-Man' star Andrew Garfield is just as spectacular but also sympathetic as Zuckerberg's wronged friend. In a double role, Armie Hammer is downright hilarious as the goofy Winklevoss twins. Director David Fincher wrings deliciously juicy irony galore out the premise that the man who turned more than 500 million users into friends turned his back on his friends to make Facebook a crowning success.",10,4,9,3 October 2010
Goodfellas," The Crime of Their Lives
","'Raging Bull' director Martin Scorsese received his third Oscar nomination as Best Director for 'Goodfellas,' starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, an engrossing epic about life in the mafia based on Nicholas Pileggi's bestselling biography about real-life gangster Henry Hill. This blue collar crime saga differs from mafia melodramas like Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' because Scorsese refrains from either eavesdropping on the upper echelons of organized crime management or depicting the actual logistics involved in its major heist. In other words, scenes concerning the hierarchy of mob bosses convening to resolve rivalries among their families or scenes about the actual heist are never shown. Nevertheless, 'Goodfellas' is violent, profane, and unrelenting in its R-rated portrayal of crime and punishment. Pesci won the Best Supporting Actor's Oscar, while 'Goodfellas' received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, and Best Screenplay based on material adapted from another medium. Incidentally, Kevin Costner's 'Dances with Wolves' trumped 'Goodfellas' for the Oscar.Essentially, Scorsese's film traces the rise and fall of Brooklyn-born, Irish/Sicilian American Henry Hill from working as a teenager at a mafia cab stand to his adult exploits as a full-fledged mafia soldier. Scorsese glamorizes Hill's life during the first hour as a crook, and the young Hill wins sympathy as an underdog. Everything turns to sour in the second hour, however, as the mutt mutates into a murderer. After several years of getting away with his crimes, our protagonist winds up in prison, gets paroled, resorts to selling cocaine, finds himself at odds with his own mafia types before he decides to participate in the Justice Department's Witness Protection Program. Incidentally, the title 'Goodfellas' refers to the mafia concept that when an individual works for the mob then he becomes one of mob. In other words, the family that slays and steals together stays together. The opening scene in 'Goodfellas' sets the tone for this grim film. Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro of 'Raging Bull'), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci of 'Lethal Weapon 2') and Henry (Ray Liotta of 'Article 99') are cruising down the highway at night when Henry gets curious about a noise that sounds suspiciously like their sedan has had a flat tire. After Henry pulls the car over, Jimmy and Tommy inspect the trunk where they have stashed the bloody body of a man swathed with sheets. Tommy stabs the man repeatedly and Jimmy blasts at the man with his revolver. The camera pushes in on Henry watching Jimmy and Tommy kill the man sprawled helplessly in the trunk and then we hear Henry utter in a voice-over, 'As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.' Intermittently, the Liotta character addresses the audience, furnishing important information about the mafia milieu, until the last few minutes when the protagonist breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience. 'Goodfellas' qualifies as a slam-bang crime thriller. This is not a film about set-pieces like you see in Coppola's 'Godfather' movies or Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time in America.' Scorsese infiltrates the audience into the mafia and shares many of the mob's secrets that have become familiar with film-going audiences in a way that seems fresh and off-the-cuff. Initially, we sympathize with young Henry (newcomer Christopher Serrone) who takes a job at Tuddy Cicero's cab stand running errands for the gangsters in the neighborhood. Before long Henry is earning more money than his hot-tempered father, and he loves the respect that the mobsters lavish on him. Tuddy (Frank DeLio of 'Kiss of Death') lets him park Cadillacs, sell contraband items, smash car windows and play fire-bug. Unlike his working class Irish father who takes a belt to him when he discovers that his son has quit attending school, the mobsters are more of a family to Henry than his own kin. As an adult, Henry becomes fast friends with Jimmy, who Henry assures us is 'one of the most feared guy in the city' and pint-sized Tommy who isn't afraid of anybody. This insider's look at the mafia follows these three mafiateers as they steal, rob, lie, cheat, and kill their way to the a fortune. When Tommy cannot convince a girl to go out on a date with unless he finds a suitable fellow for her friend, Tommy twists Henry's reluctant arm. Henry meets Karen (Lorraine Bracco, later of HBO's 'The Sopranos') who becomes his wife. There is one scene when Henry escorts Karen to a popular nightclub that dazzles her because everybody showers them with respect and praise. Although she doesn't know exactly how Henry makes his living, Henry tells her that he works for the union in the construction business. No sooner does Henry marry Karen and have kids than he starts cheating on her with whores that he sets up in nearby houses and Karen initially believes him when he cannot come home for business reasons. One morning Henry awakens to Karen straddling him in bed with a snub-nosed revolver aimed between his eyes. This is a chilling scene. It is a testament to Scorsese's skill as co-writer and director that the repugnant world of crime looks so compelling. Jimmy and Tommy are brutal, unrepentant thugs. A life of crime turns Henry into a cold, calculating operator who enjoys all the advantages of mob living. Like a movie made during the Production Code era (1934-1968) that dictated that crime should not pay, our protagonist gets his comeuppance. Nevertheless, Scorsese shows his sense of humor in one scene when Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry awaken Tommy's mother at his house and she insists on cooking a meal for them. Scorsese never lets the momentum of 'Goodfellas' slacken and this crime drama boasts enough surprises to keep audiences on their toes. Altogether, 'Goodfellas' rates as one of the top ten mob movies and its soundtrack of nostalgic tunes doesn't hurt it.",10,0,0,8 October 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne Again
","Paul Greengrass took over the helm from Doug Liman, and 'The Bourne Supremacy' is just as action packed, but Green grass clearly takes things to a higher level. The budget on this sequel stands out as we rejoin Bourne and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente of 'Run Lola Run') living off the grid in India. Things rapidly change in paradise as a Moscow Secret Service agent (Karl Urban of 'Doom') ferrets our hero out and goes gunning for him and ends up killing his girlfriend. As it turns out, Some sneaky Russians have broken up a CIA rendezvous and killed two agents.Furthermore, they have framed Jason Bourne for the homicides. CIA bigwigs Pamela Landy (Joan Allen of 'Face/Off') and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox of 'Troy') pack it off to Berlin after Bourne turns up suddenly in Naples and surprises everybody. Landry brings in Nicky (Julia Stiles of ('10 Things I Hate About You') to help figure out Bourne's next move. The fight scenes are strong and the no-holds-barred chase scene in Moscow is one of the best. Damon turns in a robust performance as the tight-lipped, quick-thinking Bourne who manages to stay a jump ahead of his adversaries, but he is by no means means indestructible, and he displays some sympathy. Cox is a slimy villAin who kills his own without a qualms.",9,3,4,7 August 2016
The Proposal," Another Opposites Attract Comedy of Errors
","Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a high-maintenance dragon lady of a boss at a prestigious New York City book publishing firm, and Ryan Reynolds of 'Wolverine' is her assistant, Andrew Paxton, who struggles to keep up with her outlandish demands. During its first quarter hour, 'The Proposal' looks like a spin on 'The Devil Wears Prada,' but with a guy enduring all of the chaos the evil woman can inflict on him rather than a woman. Instead, '27 Dresses' director Anne Fletcher, who helmed 'The Proposal,' has really made an opposites-attract romantic chick flick where the tables whirl on the icy, businees only minded Bullock. The chief complication in the newcomer Peter Chiarelli's screenplay is that Bullock's character is about to be booted out of the country by Immigration officials because she is a Canadian without U.S. citizenship. As a marriage of convenience, she springs the proposition onto her assistant, and he creates a laundry list of demands that she has no option but to accept. They fly off to Alaska to meet his parents. Betty White steals the show as the grandmother. Craig T. Nelson is cast as his dad, and Mary Steenburgen plays the mom. Reynolds has lots of issues with his father who believes that he is wasting his time in the publishing industry. Lots of funny scenes and some tearjerker scene. One of the funniest involves the Bullock character trying to save a cute little puppy from a predatory bird. The happily ever after ending that 'The Proposal' provides will make you feel GOOD!",8,0,3,1 August 2009
Warm Bodies," Zombie Makeover Movie
","When Hollywood started making zombie movies, filmmakers used voodoo as the means of controlling the dead. The first genuine zombie flick, 'White Zombie' (1932), featured Bela Lugosi of 'Dracula' infamy as a sinister zombie master who owns a sugar cane plantation and exploits zombies as his labor force. While most zombie movies were set in the West Indies, Hollywood didn't confine its sub-genre of the horror movie strictly to the Caribbean. For example, 'Revolt of the Zombies' took place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, standard-issue zombie movies, such as 'King of the Zombies' (1941), 'I Walked with a Zombie' (1943), and 'Zombies on Broadway' (1936), clung to the traditional Caribbean setting. Meantime, 'Revenge of the Zombies' (1943) occurred in Louisiana. A fiendish Nazi scientist toiled to forge zombies to supplement the ranks of Hitler's Third Reich. Occasionally, exceptions to the rule cropped up, like the first Caped Crusader serial 'Batman' (1943) where a devilish Japanese spy on American soil converted individuals into mindless zombies by means of electricity. Apparently, nobody felt like experimenting drastically with the zombie formula, aside from relocating them beyond the West Indies.Pittsburgh-based writer & director George A. Romero re-imagined the zombie formula in 1968 with his classic chiller 'Night of the Living Dead.' Ironically, nothing like a global apocalypse had spawned zombies until Romero conjured up such a notion. Romeo's zombie slayers aimed for the head when they shot zombies. The next change came about courtesy of the Italian-made epic 'Nightmare City' (1980) where zombies no longer lurched about but now ran like track superstars. Aside from this minor formula tweaking, the biggest difference in post 'Night of the Living Dead' zombie sagas has been the use of either an apocalypse or a virus to trigger an outbreak of zombie-mania. Just when you thought zombie films were stuck in a rut, Hollywood brought Seattle-based writer Isaac Marion's novel 'Warm Bodies' to the screen, and movies about the undead will no longer will be the same. Simon and Schuster published the inventive book in 2010.'50/50' writer & director Jonathan Levine's adaptation of Marion's 'Warm Bodies' is surprisingly captivating. A comparison between what occurs on screen and in Marion's book suggests Levine took minimal liberties with the source material. This innovative makeover of a moribund genre takes matters beyond anything that either 'Zombieland' or the 'Resident Evil' franchise has tried in terms of permutation. Basically, 'Warm Bodies' takes zombie movies to the next level that gore-hound purists may not appreciate. Levine doesn't pile up gratuitous amounts of blood and gore with shocking revelations to keep you stimulated. Sure, zombies feed on the living, and they prefer the brain as an entrée.Surprisingly, Levine doesn't make a spectacle out of gut-munching for the sake of gut-munching. He obscures the feeding frenzy to accommodate a PG-13 rating. First, the 'Warm Bodies' zombies consume brains to experience the memories of those they've slain. They just don't eat brains for no reason. The idea you can derive knowledge from the consumption of an opponent's gray matter is fanciful. Some cultures have argued eating the heart of an antagonist imparts strength to the victor. Second, 'Warm Bodies' has classified zombies as either good or bad. Previously, all zombies were bad. Creating a division between good and evil zombies endows the genre with greater sophistication. In the 'Warm Bodies' universe, bonies are the bad zombies. Bonies are zombies who tear the skin off their bodies and resembled mummified skeletons. They move like lightning and they are treacherous. They feast on the living as well as some of the dead. They are reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen's sword-wielding skeletons in the 1963 fantasy 'Jason and the Argonauts.' Following Marion's lead, Levine has appropriated virtually everything else from the genre but cleverly has reconstituted the subject matter.Basically, Levine has synthesized the traditional zombie movie with a romantic comedy. Like its literary source material, 'Warm Bodies' makes allusions to Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet.' Indeed, there is even a brief balcony scene, though nothing like the Shakespeare version. Our hero, a zombie known only as R (Nicholas Hoult of 'X-Men: First Class') because he cannot remember his name, has spent most of the last eight years gnawing on humans. When he doesn't join his dead pals, like M (Rob Corddry), for group hunting trips, he enjoys his vinyl collection on a stereo in a derelict commercial jetliner. You see, he holes up in an abandoned plane. All the zombies congregate at the local airport. Similarly, zombies in both George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978) and Zack Snyder's 2004 remake gravitated toward a shopping mall. After they became zombies, they were drawn by memories of the good times that they had had when they shopped together there. Our lovesick zombie falls big-time for a young female zombie fighter, Julie (Teresa Palmer of 'I Am Number Four'), after he chomps her boyfriend Perry's brain.Perry (David Franco), Julie, Nora (Analeigh Tipton), and others had left their heavily-fortified camp to scavenge the zombie infested outskirts of their fallen city for medical supplies. When the zombies storm the medical supply room, R kills Perry, chews his brain, and feels smitten by Julie since he is seeing her from Perry's perspective. Incredibly, these sentiments of love reanimate his heart. Now, R swears to protect Julie from the rest of his kind. He escorts her back to his jetliner, and they grow to love each other. According to this imaginative premise, biting into brains has the side effect of giving the undead a cerebral blast from the past. If you shun run-of-the-mill zombie movies, 'Warm Bodies' may change your attitude toward Z-pictures. This off-beat epic unites the living and the dead as allies in their collective war against the wicked bonies. The happily ever after ending may curdle in the mouths of zombie purists. Nevertheless, 'Warm Bodies' qualifies as the best thing that has happened to zombie movies since George A. Romero.",10,4,12,9 February 2013
Sully," Another Clint Masterpiece!!!
","Clint Eastwood likes to depict real-life Americans under pressure who save the day. Notorious FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover saved the day in Eastwood's biopic 'J. Edgar' (2011) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and Eastwood portrayed an individual toiling under significant pressure to defend the United States against the scourge of Communism. Similarly, in 2014's 'American Sniper,' Eastwood presented heroic Navy S.E.A.L. Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) as he put everything on the line to keep as many of his fellow soldiers alive with his superb marksmanship skills. In Eastwood's 35th film as a director, the two-time Oscar-winning helmer pays tribute to Sullenberger as a professional who felt that he was only doing his job. As the eponymous hero, Tom Hanks makes a sympathetic but effective protagonist, much as he did in the earlier 2013 seafaring hostage thriller 'Captain Phillips.' Mind you, the notion of suspense is a foregone conclusion. Everybody knows Sully was a genuine hero who executed one of the most incredible forced water landings of a commercial passenger aircraft in history when he glided US Airways Flight 1549 into the chilly waters of New York City's Hudson River in 2009 without a single fatality. Not only did Sully perform an act of unparalleled bravery, but also the first responders displayed comparable gallantry in rescuing Sully, his crew, and his passengers. Nevertheless, beneath the surface of his icy demeanor, Tom Hanks never lets us forget that Sully was made of flesh & blood, was racked by doubts and fears, and principally about what might have happened had he not followed his instincts and experience.Despite the fact that we know Captain Sullenberger survived the river landing in real life, director Clint Eastwood opens 'Sully' with an audacious scene. Sully's aircraft crashes into Manhattan, and fireball explosions galore erupt with horrific consequences. Sully (Tom Hanks of 'Forrest Gump') awakens from this nightmare in a Big Apple motel. Throughout the rest of the film, he ponders what else that he could have done, and later has another nightmare wherein Katie Couric calls him a 'fraud' on network television. As Eastwood's account of the incident shows, trouble struck US Airways Flight 1549 on its New York to Charlotte, North Carolina flight, about three minutes after the aircraft had lifted off from La Guardia. A flock of Canadian geese crossed the flight path of the Airbus A320 as it was ascending to 3000 feet, collided with its two powerful GE turbofan engines, and were churned in an aviary slush. If you read Sullenberger's autobiography 'Miracle on the Hudson,' he describes the birds as 'slurry' after the engines ground them up, and the smell of charred fowls filtered into the cabin. The aircraft lost both engines and neither could be brought back into service. The veteran pilot 'eyeballed' his options and decided to ditch in the drink. 'Brace for impact,' Sully warned his crew and passengers about a minute and a half before he glided the 70-ton jet into Hudson. Miraculously, the plane neither blew up nor sank. Sully, his First Office Jake Skiles (Aaron Eckhart of 'The Dark Knight'), and their three flight attendants evacuated the aircraft before water rose above the seats in the single-aisle cabin. First responders and scuba cops appeared on the scene, and everybody was bundled in jackets and carried to either side of the Hudson. One mild subplot involves a family of three grown-ups who are separated during the multi-vessel rescue operation. Ironically enough, these three had scrambled to get aboard Flight 1549 before it took off. Meanwhile, Sully was desperate to know if all passengers had been accounted for. Eventually, after a hospital check-up later during the day, he received confirmation that everybody had been located. 'Perfect Stranger' scenarist Todd Komarnicki's screenplay divides the incident into three stories: Sully and his encounters with an adversial National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), several telephone conversations with his anxious wife Lorraine (Laura Linney of 'Mr. Holmes'), and the actual incident in the Hudson itself. One amusing episode has a restless Sully jog from his motel to a Manhattan bar for a drink. Pete, the bartender (Michael Rapaport of 'True Romance'), brags about their new alcoholic concoction named the Sully. According to Pete, the libation consists of Grey Goose vodka and a splash of water. Meantime, each time that Sully and Jeff deal with the NTSB, the board is contentiously brusque, and Sully worries about his career, largely because he wants to see the flight simulations of the incident. Basically, the NTSB emerges as the villains until fade-out.Suffice to say, 'Sully' is about as succinct as a mainstream Hollywood film can be. Eastwood has delivered one of the more focused films of his 45-year career clocking in at 96 trim minutes. Despite its austere brevity, you will never feel like you have been slighted. You get to experience the forced water landing at least twice along with some other exciting aerial shenanigans. Aside from another show-stopper of a performance by Hanks, Eastwood has surrounded him with a first-class cast, right down to minor roles. Jamey Sheridan, Mike O'Malley, and Anna Gunn comprise the NTSB panel, and they make classic villains. Recently, the actual NTSB has complained that they weren't anywhere as dastardly has Eastwood and company have portrayed them. Nevertheless, good, solid, dramatic films require the presence of a villain, and they fit the bill adequately because our hero has to answer to them. The water landing looks about as real as you might imagine it, and Eastwood shows it from the perspective of several observers who happened to spot the plane as it went down. However, don't go to 'Sully' searching for melodramatic heroics like the John Wayne classic 'The High and the Mighty' (1954) because you will walk out definitely disappointed. 'Sully' celebrates not only an American, but it also celebrates American character in general, and Eastwood's epic may rank as the best feel-good picture to illuminate screens in a long time.",9,0,2,17 September 2016
Valkyrie," Where Was Ethan Hunt When We Really Needed Him?
","The new Tom Cruise movie 'Valkyrie,' a dutiful but dreary reenactment of the 20th July 1944, Hitler bomb plot is no blast. Clocking in at a tedious two hours, this military procedural potboiler about the last of 15 flawed efforts to assassinate Adolf Hitler displays immaculate production values and a first-class cast. Nevertheless, 'Superman Returns' director Bryan Singer serves up no thrills or chills. Further, 'Valkyrie' provides no surprises or suspense, primarily because we know already that the pusillanimous generals botched the bomb plot. Mind you, 'Valkyrie' isn't the first movie about the fateful events leading up to another bungled German Army High Command conspiracy to kill Hitler and salvage the Third Reich. The Germans themselves produced an award-winning, made-for-TV movie 'Stauffenberg' about the Hitler bomb attempt in 2004. Previously, CBS-TV aired 'The Plot to Kill Hitler' with 'Midnight Express' star Brad Davis playing Colonel von Stauffenberg in 1990. The bomb plot played a peripheral role in the Richard Burton World War II film 'Breakthrough' (1978) with Robert Mitchum. The classic Peter O'Toole World War II thriller 'The Night of the Generals' (1967) contained a subplot about von Stauffenberg's fiasco. Earlier, back in 1955, West German filmmakers unveiled the first theatrical version of the same events entitled 'The Plot to Assassinate Hitler' with Wolfgang Priess starring as von Stauffenberg. Even if World War II film fanatics haven't heard of Priess, they have seen him in several W.W. II films, notably 'The Longest Day,' 'A Bridge Too Far,' 'Raid on Rommel,' and 'Von Ryan's Express.' 'Valkyrie' opens in Tunisia, North Africa 1943, with the German Army's 10th Panzer Division in the desert. Colonel von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) writes in his diary about his determination to kill Hitler and save lives. Later, he speaks with a Wehrmacht officer general who resembles Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, but this officer (Bernard Hill of 'Titanic') clearly isn't the legendary Desert Fox. Moments later, British fighter planes swoop down to strafe and bomb the Germans. Explosions kill the Rommel looking general while von Stauffenberg loses his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand. Miscast as he is, Tom Cruise earns some credit for playing a radically different type of hero than he usually plays. However, the top-notch British and German actors who surround him blow him off the screen with their heavyweight performances. Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and even comedian Eddie Izzard upstage him at every turn.After von Stauffenberg recovers from his wounds, he joins the general staff of General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy of 'Underworld') and fellow conspirators Major-General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh of 'Henry V') and General Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp of 'Yes Man') tap him to devise a better plan to kill Hitler. Ironically, von Stauffenberg concocts a new plan when he is reunited with his family on holiday. His children spin a copy of Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries' on their turntable. Allied bombers break up the reunion and the needle skips off the 78 RPM record. As he huddles in an air raid shelter, von Stauffenberg hears the tone arm skip back to play the Wagner opera and his eyes glitter. The generals approve of von Stauffenberg's plan to mobilize Hitler's reserve army--codenamed 'Valkyrie'--to help them take control of the Third Reich after they have killed the dastardly dictator. Our hero sets about the task of recruiting more members for the conspiracy and devising an explosive charge that will kill Hitler. Unfortunately, von Stauffenberg begins to see why all previous assassinate attempts failed. The political and military titans of the conspiracy lack conviction and quarrel about petty details. The indecision on the part of these conspirators and von Stauffenberg's own crusade to kill the little corporal seal their doom and safeguard Hitler.Technically, while 'Valkyrie' is correct in every respect with regard to history, Singer and writers Christopher McQuarrie of 'The Usual Suspects' and newcomer Nathan Alexander have made a thriller than generates monotony more often than momentum. 'Valkyrie' plays out in rooms and on roads. We watch German officers get out of either planes or cars, march into buildings, enter rooms, and talk, talk, talk. Afterward, we watch these same officers exit rooms, walk out of buildings, get into either cars or planes, and head off to other interiors where they babble some more. Incredibly, there are only two quotable lines in the entire movie! Singer and company provide a few scenes between our hero and his wife, but each lacks intimacy because they are either disrupted by a bombing raid or music drowns out their dialogue.Worse, Adolf Hitler (David Bamber of 'The Bourne Identity') spends most of his time on screen puttering about in a daze. Why would any filmmaker trot out the most heinous villain of 20th century history and reduce him to a simpering sad sack? Indeed, 'Valkyrie' arouses more sympathy for Hitler than the people who proved themselves too incompetent to eliminate him. Ultimately, 'Valkyrie' isn't so much a tragedy of errors as it is a humdrum movie about a conspiracy of well-meaning imbeciles who wanted to strike a bargain with the Allies before the Allied armies trampled the Fatherland. Anybody who knows their history knows about the newsreel footage of der Fuehrer stomping happily about after the debacle of the bomb attempt. Hitler is never shown performing this shtick.Suffice to say, avoid 'Valkyrie!'",1,23,55,30 December 2008
The Soloist," 'The Soloist' Will Bow You Over
","I saw 'The Soloist' the other night when there was nothing else on that I hadn't seen. I wound up at one of those special showings where nobody else showed up for the movie. It was just as well that nobody else showed up. 'The Soloist' is what callous critics label as a tear-jerker. Although I'm a guy, I don't mind crying at movies. The best movies make you cry or at least they make me cry. Sometimes you cry a lot because it is really a tender, sensitive movie about many sweet souls who endure travails that nobody should suffer from, and you'd have to be an ogle not to weep. And then there are those movies where you laugh so hard that you cry.'The Soloist' qualifies as the first kind of weep-a-thon. A real-life Los Angeles newspaper columnist, Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr. of 'Iron Man') discovers this guy, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx of 'Miami Vice'),living out of a shopping cart but who plays the violin or the cello. He can be found virtually anywhere and he's playing classical music. He plays Beethoven so well that Lopez is drawn to his plight. Anyway, Lopez has led a pretty screwed up life. His wife (Catherine Keener of 'The 40-Year Old Virgin')serves as his editor at the Los Angeles Times where he writes, but they are divorced and manage to co-exist. They have a college-age son that Lopez never talks to and she has all these important news stories that she wants him to follow up on. Instead, Lopez decides to investigate this homeless African-American who plays classical movie like a genius. He discovers that Nathaniel dropped out of Julliard and now lives on the streets of L.A where--according to the movie--90-thousand homeless people live. Lopez gets Nathaniel strings for his musical instrument and struggles to get the guy off the streets. The life of homeless people is depicted as dreadful. 'Atonement' director Joe Wright pushes all the right buttons without pushing them to heavily. These desperate people--many of whom are insane--get harassed by everybody simply because they are vulnerable and have nobody to protect them. Lopez begins to behave like a parent and wants to control Nathaniel's life. He wants to get Nathaniel to see a doctor and get medication, so he can come to his senses and join the rest of grieving humanity. The homeless guy worships the ground that Lopez walks on without question.Meanwhile,the thick-skinned people that run a homeless shelter try to convince Lopez that all the do-gooder things that he wants to do for Nathaniel are wrong. They tell him just to be the guy's friend. Wright strikes the right balance between being a hopeless liberal and restrained conservative. Every time that you see Jamie Foxx, you want to cry because he is so vulnerable and his life is so wretched. Lopez is haunted by Nathaniel's predicament and Lopez starts climbing the walls with anxiety, and you want to cry because he is going through so much grief to help Nathaniel but Nathaniel is so spaced out on planet Nathaniel that he doesn't seem to care. In fact, at one point, the Foxx character turns vicious and threatens to kill Nathaniel. In an effort to lighten things up, Wright works in a wacky subplot about the problems with raccoons that Lopez is dealing with because these critters are excavating holes in his lawn and a pest specialist assures him that the secret to running the coons off is to use coyote urine.Basically, 'The Soloist' is an ode to homeless people. Homeless people must be treated with dignity. We shouldn't try to help them by making their lives more miserable than they already are. So there I sit soaking up this saga, crying for the existence of the poor homeless guy because it is a miracle that he survives each day and watching the poor journalist going through hell because he genuinely wants to make a difference. Foxx and Downey are both nothing short of brilliant. These roles are the kind that actors live and breathe for because the characters are so out of the box. Catherine Keener plays Downey's ex-wife and boss and she is still looks sexy even though she is no longer a spring chicken. She spends most of her time ridiculing all of her ex-husband's best efforts.'The Soloist' is an art-house movie. Popcorn munching maniacs on a date are not going to put up with this somewhat tragic film. Yes, there is a happy compromise ending. And there I sit with tears streaming down my face between of my sympathy for the plight of the homeless while I'm crying for laughter at the conflicted journalist because he tries so hard to make a difference and doesn't realize that he has made a difference.The real surprise is that I'll probably go back and see this nonsense again because of the acting and the storyline. It is a very meaningful movie with a lot of irony. I think that the message is that we are all our brother's keepers, but we don't need to turn into crusaders. It is like when somebody has a problem. You don't try and solve their problem because they will get resentful because you are butting into their life. However, if you sit and listen to them, they love you. You have to have a sense of humor.",8,2,3,8 May 2009
Rock Star," Director Stephen Herek's sense of style helps to make 'Rock Star' palatable
","Writing about flawed films sometimes is more fun than writing about fabulous ones. Flawed films interest me for what they aspired to rather than achieved. Take director Stephen Herek's 'Rock Star,' for example, a cinematic experience as amiable but anemic as its generic title. The original title was 'Metal God,' and the studio should have kept it. Somewhere beneath this superficial but alluring epic penned by actor, writer, & sometime director John Stockwell lurks a better movie. Imagine a diluted version of 'The Doors' meets 'The Jazz Singer.' The shoddy third act resolution generates little catharsis. 'Rock Star' lacks a physical villain, so our hero has nobody to contend with but himself. As charismatic as Mark Wahlberg is, he struggles valiantly to make an impression as a remote, aloof character devoid of ambiguity. Poor Jennifer Aniston vanishes in the second act, only to return late in act three to provide closure to a routine romance. Wahlberg and Aniston make a good couple, but their romance evaporates in act two. 'Rock Star' is neither as provocative as 1979's 'The Rose' with Bette Midler' nor as satiric as Rob Reiner's classic 'This Is Spinal Tap.' This middle-of-the-road rock'n' roll opera doesn't rock enough but rolls briskly to its inevitable cautionary conclusion. Be yourself is the message. Essentially, Herek & Stockwell adapted the real-life Cinderella saga of Tim 'Ripper' Owens, an Akron, Ohio, musician who idolized British head bangers Judas Priest, but turned it into inoffensive potboiler. Happily, director Stephen Herek of 'Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead' and 'Mr. Holland's Opus' ushers a supremely competent cast through their paces. Even when this harmless, 106 minute expose of fame isn't terribly profound, Herek makes it infinitely easy to watch, thanks in part to both Ueli Steiger's atmospheric cinematography and Trudy Ship's snappy editing.'Rock Star' unfolds during the noisy Reagan years of the 1980s. By day, Pittsburgh native Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg of 'Three Kings') toils as a photo-copier repair technician and lives at home in his parents' day-care center. (I liked the way Herek & Stockwell inserted the clever symbolism about a copier repairman who copies a rock star.) By night, Chris lets his hair down and boogies with Blood Pollution, a heavy-metal tribute band to fictitious British rockers Steel Dragon. Incidentally, neither Judas Priest nor Tim Owens sought to be associated with 'Rock Star,' which explains why Herek & Stockwell have embellished things. Anyway, Chris has been grooving on Steel Dragon since his disappointed big brother Joe dumped their debut album in his lap. Bad blood exists between Chris and Joe; Joe happens to be a uniformed patrolman. Chris' girlfriend Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston of TV's 'Friends') serves as Blood Pollution's manager. So absorbed and obsessed is Chris with replicating Steel Dragon tunes riff for riff that he refuses to tolerate the least departure from their original material. Chris's fanaticism aggravates fellow guitarist & friend Rob (smarmy Timothy Olyphant of 'Scream 2') who claims the fans won't object to his improvisations. Eventually, during a concert at a steel factory, Chris catches Rob improvising, and the two scrap on stage. Later, when Chris and Emily show up for a practice session in the basement of a porno movie theatre, Rob announces they have replaced Chris. An argument erupts, and Chris discovers to his horror that his friends consider themselves a 'cover band' instead of 'a tribute band.' They exploit Steel Dragon tunes to lure in audiences and then regale them with their own originals. Chris throws a tantrum and storms out with Emily at his heels. No sooner has this happened than Chris receives a call from Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West of '28 Days') of Steel Dragon. Initially, Chris suspects he is being duped until Kirk convinces him beyond a shadow of a doubt. Sworn to secrecy, Chris shares two of his groupie friends, Nina and Samantha, and Steel Dragon wants him to audition for lead singer. Chris and Emily fly out to L.A., and Chris discovers to his chagrin that Steel Dragon lead singer Bobby Beers is gay. Apparently, Bobby (Jason Flemyng of 'Snatch') has been neglecting his responsibilities to the band, and Steel Dragon axes him.Before long, Emily and Chris realize they cannot stay together. She heads off to Seattle with a girlfriend to open a coffee shop. Fellow band member A.C. (Jason Bonham, son of the late 'Led Zeppelin' drummer John Bonham) advises Chris to let Emily go, too. Says A.C.: 'Your job is to live the fantasy other people only dream about. Dream big--live the life.' The next time Chris sees Emily, he is so wasted he doesn't realize he is in Seattle where she runs her coffee shop. Herek & Stockwell give this section of 'Rock Star' the short shrift. Several scenes appear to be missing, because the drama dries up in the third act. Eventually, Chris learns success with Steel Dragon comes at a price. A.C. and Kirk write all the songs, and they scoff at Chris's ideas and songs. Unlike most movies where the characters neither grow nor evolve, Chris does grow and winds up hitting the road to do his own thing.The cast performs splendidly. Mark Wahlberg is thoroughly persuasive as the naive, gullible Chris. The major shortcomings in 'Rock Star' lay with John Stockwell's shallow script that gives Wahlberg nothing to work with in fleshing out a bone and blood character. Chris suffers minimally at the hands of Steel Dragon. He doesn't experience a baptism by fire that would reform him. Herek & Stockwell do an adequate job of recreating the era of big hair styles. This expose exposed little which hasn't already been exposed. The soundtrack qualifies as something of a consolation. The problem with 'Rock Star' is it is just too upbeat. The performers are more interesting than their roles. Ultimately, director Stephen Herek's sense of style helps to make 'Rock Star' palatable.",5,0,1,7 February 2008
The Martian," My Favorite Martian Movie
","Hollywood has made approximately 29 movies about planet Mars. The five most recent sagas about Mars—'Mission to Mars' (2000), 'Red Planet' (2000), 'Doom' (2005), 'John Carter' (2012), and The Last Days on Mars (2013)—failed to recoup their budgets. Among the notable films about Mars that most moviegoers may remember are the four-minute silent film 'A Trip to Mars' (1910), the Soviet silent epic 'Aelita' (1924), 'Flight to Mars' (1951), 'Conquest of Space' (1955), 'The Angry Red Planet' (1956), 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space' (1957), 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1962), 'Total Recall' (1990) and its' remake 'Total Recall' (2012). 'Mission to Mars' surpassed 'Red Planet' while 'John Carter' wasn't abominably bad. Halloween' helmer John Carpenter has probably made one of the least compelling pulp movies about Mars entitled 'Ghosts of Mars.' Happily, the latest movie about Mars appropriately entitled 'The Martian' ranks as probably the best movie ever made about the fourth rock from the sun. Apart from its unwieldy 141 minutes that starts to drag about three-fourths of the way through, 'The Martian' is a believable sci-fi film. Anybody who has read Andrew Weir's bestseller will be pleased with director Ridley Scott's largely faithful adaptation penned by Drew Goddard who wrote the abysmal 'Cloverfield' but the brilliant 'The Cabin in the Woods.' Ostensibly, Scott and Goddard only saw fit to omit two major complications from Weir's fascinating first novel: the short-circuit drill scene when our hero is modifying the second Rover and the tumbling Rover scene on the journey to the Schiaparelli crater. The predominantly first-person narrated novel contains more of astronaut Mark Watney's acerbic, R-rated personality than the PG-13 film could afford. For example, read the first sentence in 'The Martian.' If either it or subsequent sentences with the F-word don't offend you, you can probably make it through this entertaining book rather rapidly.When a devastating Martian sandstorm threatens NASA's Ares III manned mission, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain of 'Interstellar') orders the six-person crew to abandon their work and lift off for their ship, the Hermes, in orbit around the red planet. During their hasty evacuation, one of the astronauts, botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon of 'Interstellar'), is separated from the crew. Actually, he is struck by an antenna on a communication dish that skewers him in the stomach and knocks him unconscious. Lewis struggles without success to find Watney in the blinding sandstorm. Meanwhile, the sandstorm grows even more treacherous, and Lewis gives up her search because the high winds are tilting the ship that will launch the crew into orbit. Basically, the crew of the Ares III leaves Mark behind to save itself. NASA Chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels of 'My Favorite Martian') reports the news of Watney's demise, and a funeral is held for him. What nobody knows at the time is that Watney is still alive. After he extracts the spear of the antenna from his stomach, Watney embarks on an ambitious scheme to keep himself alive for the next four years until Ares IV arrives. A major part of Watney's plan to keep from starving involves the planting of potatoes inside the mission's artificial habitat. Eventually, one of NASA's employees, Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis of 'That Awkward Moment'), who monitors the satellites around Mars, spots something suspicious in the photos of the Ares III mission site. She alerts Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor of 'American Gangster') about these curious occurrences. Everybody is suddenly elated when they discover that Watney managed to survive the savage sandstorm. Sanders brainstorms and convenes various NASA experts to work on a rescue plan for Watney, but NASA has no way of contacting our tenacious hero. At the same time, Watney behaves like the ingenious television character MacGuyer. He improvises a way to communicate with NASA that involves cruising in the Mars rover off to the distant site of the Mars Pathfinder probe. Meanwhile, Sanders refuses to notify the Hermes crew because he fears the revelation of Watney's survival may imperil the mission. Initially, NASA crew supervisor Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean of 'GoldenEye') and JPL director Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong of 'Prometheus') launch a space probe to resupply Watney until the Ares IV mission gets off the ground. The probe blows up not long after launch. If this were not bad enough for Watney, the habitat where he is raising his potato plants explodes when the airlock decompresses. Naturally, nothing goes right for either Watney or NASA, but salvation comes from the least expected place.'Blade Runner' director Ridley Scott keeps things compelling throughout most of 'The Martian' as Watney and NASA encounter one invincible setback after another. Indeed, 'The Martian' surpasses the similarly-themed Sandra Bullock & George Clooney outer space epic 'Gravity' because the story is related from a number of different perspectives. While Watney is struggling to survive on Mars, Sanders is under incredible pressure to concoct a foolproof plan to rescue him. Every plan that he comes up with requires his team to work so quickly that they cannot take their usual precautions. 'The Martian' shifts back and forth between Watney and the various NASA officials working around the clock to save him. Eventually, Sanders allows Henderson to inform the Hermes crew about Watney's survival. Production values are generally stellar and nothing appears to have been spared. The craggy scenery of Jordan substitutes persuasively for the inhospitable Martian terrain. The part of the action transpires within the massive Hermes spaceship, and the five person crew weigh in on Watney's fate. Happily, 'The Martian' isn't a dry, straightforward, documentary style sci-fi thriller. Although he doesn't appear on screen every minute, Matt Damon dominates 'The Martian' and Watney's irreverent sense of humor. The inspirational finale when Watney decides to imitate Iron Man is amusing. Not only did NASA embrace author Andrew Weir, but the space agency also reportedly cooperated with Ridley Scott more than it had on previous movies to ensure accuracy. Altogether, 'The Martian' qualifies as a gripping intergalactic spectacle.",9,3,7,13 October 2015
Law Abiding Citizen," One Hellva Great Law & Order Thriller!!!
","'Set It Up' director F. Gary Gray's sophisticated but far-fetched law and order actioneer 'Law Abiding Citizen' ranks as the one of best mediations about our flawed justice system in the guise of a cracker-jack popcorn thriller. Good movies pack twists and turns as well as surprises, and 'Street Kings' scenarist Kurt Wimmer serves up at least five (count'em) surprises in this high-octane hybrid of prison pictures and mass murderer epics. Moreover, Wimmer has created an imaginative cat & mouse conflict of wills between a stalwart hero and an ingenious villain who share shades of gray. In other words, Jamie Foxx's prosecutor appears callous, while Gerard Butler's villain retains some sympathy. You may find yourself rooting for bad-guy Butler over good-guy Foxx. Meanwhile, Gray stages the white-knuckled action with finesse to spare. 'Law Abiding Citizen' surpasses Gray's earlier nail-biters 'The Italian Job,' 'The Negotiator' and 'A Man Apart.' Not only does Gerard Butler constantly upstage a dour Jamie Foxx, but Butler delivers the heartest performance. He comes close to chewing the scenery, but the villain that he plays would chew scenery so his juicy performance isn't too far off base.'Law-Abiding Citizen' opens with two desperate criminals, Clarence Darby (Christian Stotle of 'Public Enemies') and Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart of 'The Collector'), invading a house in suburban Philadelphia. The two are posing as food delivery guys; at least, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler of 'The Ugly Truth') opens the door for them because he mistakenly believes they are in food delivery. Before he has time to react, they smash him savagely with a baseball bat, knock him down, and then gag and tie him with plastic zip-ties. A helpless Clyde watches in horror as Clarence stabs his wife (Brook Stacy Mills of 'Hairspray')and is about to rape her when Clyde's daughter (newcomer Ksenia Hulayev) enters the room. The thugs abduct the daughter and the next thing we hear is that the little girl has been murdered, too. Since he cannot assemble enough evidence to convict these hoodlums, career-oriented Assistant Prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx of 'The Soloist') decides to preserve his winning record of prosecutions and cuts a deal with Clarence. To get a lighter sentence, the dastardly Clarence testifies that Rupert killed Clyde's wife.Initially, when he hears about the plea bargain, Clyde is shocked. He saw his family butchered and he hasn't forgotten the murders. Rice points out two things. First, Clarence is going to jail for a long time. Second, Rupert has been sentenced to death by lethal injection based on Clarence testimony. Reluctantly, Clyde trusts Rice to do the right thing, but he has vengeance lurking in his mind. Grief-stricken, Clyde cannot help but feel that justice has been denied him. When it comes time to execute Rupert, he dies in the worse way possible and creates a sensation for Nick and his co-worker, Sarah Lowell (Leslie Bibb of 'Iron Man'), who has never attended an execution. Ten years elapse and Clarence gets out of jail, but not for long. Clyde kidnaps him, takes him to an anonymous warehouse and breaks out some of the props that would go with a 'Saw.' Clyde sends Rice a DVD copy of Clarence's murder, but Clyde cannot be identified in the video because he has on a welder's mask. Things come to a boil when the video arrives at Rice's house and his daughter gets her hands on it. She thinks that it is a video shot of her at a musical recital.Clyde is waiting when the police arrive, and they take him into custody. Rice appreciates Clyde's vengeance because he has a daughter, too. Afterward, when Rice sets out to prosecute him, Clyde wants to make a deal. What Rice doesn't know is that Clyde is manipulating him. Eventually, Clyde winds up in solitary confinement, locked up and away from everybody. Rice thinks that everything is cool because Clyde is where he can harm nobody. No sooner is Clyde in solitary than he goes to work. He warns Rice that he will kill, too, unless they release him. Rice is incredulous when public officials who had something to do with the Shelton murder case begin to mysteriously die in front page murders. The mayor of Philadelphia (Viola Davis of 'Doubt') demands that Rice take action against Shelton, but Rice can find nothing. After all, Clyde is locked up tight in a maximum security cell with no way to get out of prison.This thought-provoking morality yarn never wears out its welcome during its nimble 108 minutes. Mind you, the only flaw in the film is its outlandish quality. Nevertheless, the theme that everybody must be held accountable for their actions is played out to perfection by the filmmakers. The first-class supporting class includes Colm Meaney of TV's 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' as a Philly detective, Bruce McGill of 'Obsessed' as Rice's colleague and Annie Corley of 'Monster' as a Philadelphia judge. What you don't catch the first time out in this complex crime movies adds to the entertainment of second and third viewings. Make no mistake, 'Law Abiding Citizen' earned its R-rating for strong bloody brutal violence and torture, a scene of rape, and pervasive language. Although its contains some pretty graphic murder sequences, 'Law Abiding Citizen' is nowhere near as sadistic or repellent as the latest 'Saw' movie 'Saw VI.'",10,3,9,26 October 2009
Up in the Air," Nothing Really Heavy . . . But Entertaining
","George Clooney plays a clean-cut, suit-and-tie guy who wings around the country via American Airlines delivering the bad news to sacked employees because their bosses lack the intestinal fortitude to fire them. He is really good at his job and he has gotten to liking what he does because there is an art to telling people that they are fired. He also likes to give speeches to inspirational speeches to audiences about how to live without things. It is his back-pack speech. He is a bachelor who lives a frugal lifestyle and takes all the advantages that flying American Airlines offers. Along the way, he meets a delicious looking doll Alex Goran(Vera Farmiga of 'Orphan') who flies all over, too, and they strike up an occasional romance with no strings attached. Corporate boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman of 'Extract') calls our hero into the main office in Omaha and announces that the company wants to cut expenses by firing people on the Internet. Of course, Ryan (George Clooney) thinks that this is a bad idea for several good reasons. The individual who came up with this bright idea is a newbie Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who likes to use some of the lines that Ryan wields in his interviews. Craig decides to let Ryan take Natalie out to show her the ropes. If you have ever flown or flown as much as Ryan has, the endless scenes in airport terminals will seem familiar.'Up in the Air' springs several important surprises that may catch you blind and irony plays an important role in the narrative. Essentially, this movie is rather like the western movies where the veteran gunslinger teaches the green gunslingers all the tricks of the trade. J.K. Simmons of 'Spiderman' movies, Sam Elliot, Danny McBride, and Zach Galifianakis of 'The Hangover' all put in cameo appearances. Clooney is his usual polished self. 'Up in the Air' is a good movie but it does not have the sarcasm of director Jason Reitman's previous films 'Thank You For Smoking' and 'Juno.' This is the first movie that recognizes a fad where people have pictures of themselves taken in places that they have not visited.",8,2,6,3 January 2010
From Here to Eternity," Superb Military Drama About An Individual Struggle Against Conformity!
","America in the 1950s developed into a land where conformity ruled. Suburbs with look-alike housing proliferated in the form of Levitttowns. People grew fearful of anybody who criticized the American way of life. These critics became easy targets for anti-Communist crusaders, like The House Committee on Un-American Activities, whose mandate it was to investigate anybody with suspicious activities that might threaten America. Meanwhile, the affluence and domesticity that swept America were reflected in lowered rates of divorce and homicide. Nevertheless, some Americans feared that people had sunk into a morass of complacency and conformity that came with the impetus of a consumer-oriented, materialistic culture. Novelists in the early 1950s challenged this ideology and dealt with individuals trying to maintain their personality in the midst of mass culture that oppressed them. These problems had lain dominant since before World War II. Former soldier turned novelist James Jones unleashed them in his scandalous bestseller 'From Here to Eternity' (1951) about the dehumanizing environment of military life at Schofield Barracks on Oahu, Hawaii on the eve of the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. The novel contained adultery, promiscuity, sadism, and racism. The climate of the 1950s virtually guaranteed that Jones' novel, which was very critical of the U.S. military, would never illuminate the silver screen. Nothing, however, could dissuade Columbia Pictures studio boss Harry Cohn would producing the novel. Cohn called on MGM contract director Fred Zinnemann to helm the project. They agreed that filming 'From Here to Eternity' without the cooperation of the U.S. military would make such a production impossible.Producer Buddy Adler, a former Army officer himself, helped resolve the conflicts between the military and the filmmakers so that a palatable version of 'From Here to Eternity' could be produced. Columbia Pictures not only had to placate the military but they also had to contend with the repressive Production Code Administration, the industry's internal censors who objected to anything that did not portray American and its institutions in an idealized manner. Meanwhile, Cohn and Zinnemann argued about the casting, especially Montgomery Cliff, who eventually won the role over studio contract player Aldo Ray, the man that Cohn favored. Cohn and Zinnemann cast Deborah Kerr, whose reputation for playing proper women, went against type for the role she would have. The most notorious bit of casting involved crooner Frank Sinatra, whose career was tanking horribly, instead of Eli Wallach.The first time we see Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Cliff of 'Red River') he is marching across the parade ground in the opposite direction of the soldier drilling. Zinnemann deliberating staged the opening scene so that it would be clear that Prewitt differed from the rest of the men. Prewitt meets Maggio (scrappy Frank Sinatra) and says that he has transferred out of the bugle corp. Maggio advises Prewitt that he has made a terrible mistake. Maggio comments: 'This outfit they can give back to General Custer.' First Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster of 'Criss Cross') lays down the law during their first encounter. 'This here is a rifle company. You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself until sundown.' Prewitt meets Captain Holmes and explains that he accepted a demotion from corporal to private to transfer out of the bugle corps because his first sergeant replaced him with the friend. Prewitt was the best bugler, but friend counted more to the sergeant than quality. Holmes has pulled strings to get Prewitt into his outfit so that they can win the boxing finals. Prewitt refuses to fight for Holmes. It seems that Prewitt blinded a friend boxing and has since refused to don the gloves and enter the ring. 'Looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf,' Holmes observes, and adds, 'In the Army, it's the individual that counts.' All of Holmes' sergeants, who do box, except for Warden, give Prewitt 'the treatment' to make him change his mind. Prewitt, however, doesn't capitulate. Meanwhile, Warden takes up with Karen Holmes (Deborah Kerr) and they secretly date behind her husband's back. Warden is playing with fire because if he were caught, he could land in Leavenworth for twenty years.Maggio introduces Prewitt to society in town at a place called 'the New Congress Club.' In Jones' book, establishments like these were really whorehouses, but the Production Code required that Columbia sanitize these settings into harmless social clubs on the level of USO Clubs. Prewitt meets a strikingly beautiful lady, Lorene (Donna Reed of 'It's A Wonderful Life') and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Maggio clashes with a brute of a first sergeant, Sergeant Judson (Ernst Borgnine of 'Marty'), who prefers to plink away on the piano with all the dexterity of a monkey. Judson's bad piano music interferes with Maggio's dancing with a girl and they confront each other. Prewitt pulls Maggio off before the two can fight. Holmes' sergeants redouble the hazing, but Prewitt holds his own against them, until the irritable captain wants to draw up court marshal papers. Warden intervenes and suggests that Holmes put Prewitt on double punishment duty. Eventually, Maggio goes AWOL, and he winds up in the stockade where Judson beats him mercilessly until Maggio escapes. Maggio dies in Prewitt's arms and Prewitt tangles with Judson in a back alley and they fight until Prewitt stabs Judson to death. Unfortunately, Judson stabs Prewitt who flees to the safety of Lorene's house. Lorene came to Hawaii so that she could earn 'a stocking full of money' and return to her small home town in Oregon to live out her life in style and respect. At the same time, Warden and Karen date and have to hide out from all military officers.'From Here to Eternity' won Zinnemann the Oscar for Best Director. The film claimed eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Sinatra, in his career reviving role, won a Best Supporting Oscar.",10,2,3,6 February 2009
The Island," Not The Usual Michael Bay Nonsense
","Michael Bay's science-fiction thriller 'The Island' (*** out of ****) provides a refreshing change of pace from a summer glutted with prequels, sequels, remakes, and comic book superhero sagas. Despite its abysmal weekend box office figures and the usual critical carping that accompany all his movies, 'The Island' qualifies as Bay's best movie since 'The Rock' (1996), that far-fetched but supercharged nonsense about Nicolas Cage & Sean Connery escaping from Alcatraz. A number of things set 'The Island' apart from its formula-driven competition. First, superstars don't flesh out the cast. Sure, Ewan McGregor receives top billing, but nobody would remember him as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the latest 'Star Wars' trilogy, because the British actor wields neither a light saber nor does he wear a beard and a bathrobe. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson hasn't acquired the clout that Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Lopez command. Nevertheless, she definitely looks bound for stardom in her own right. As a couple, McGregor and Johansson don't exactly set the world aflame like Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt did in 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith.' Second, our heroes lack career professional skills, trades, or crafts. Meaning, they aren't cops, nurses, pilots, criminals, attorneys, or scientists out to save the world. Instead, they resemble grown-up children without street smarts confronting a hostile society that deliberately misleads them every step of the way. Third, the writers borrow important plot ideas from other sci-fi epics like 'Logan's Run,' 'Soylent Green,' 'THX-1138,' 'Coma,' 'Westworld' and 'Planet of the Apes,' so that 'The Island' emerges unmistakably as an homage to those late 1960s/early 1970s Watergate-inspired paranoid sci-fi white-knucklers that you enjoy with greater satisfaction based on less information about their plots. Don't discuss 'The Island' with anybody unless you want them to blow its secrets and surprises. Fourth, Michael Bay has actually helmed a feature-length film that has something relevant to say about our society. Of course, this doesn't discourage the 'Armageddon' director from hyping up the third act with trigger-happy police, explosions, auto chases, improbable surprises, and the usual demolition derby tactics that Bay has a knack for staging in big, overripe blockbuster blow-outs like 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Bad Boys' movies.Cast as Lincoln Six Echo, Ewan McGregor of 'Trainspotting' plays a compliant but curious nobody in a futuristic society where the inhabitants display no curiosity about their state of affairs and crave no desire to defy authority. Lincolnwe learn--survived a major catastrophe along with several thousand other people that has left the Earth a contaminated wasteland. As a result, those like Lincoln Echo Six must live in quarantine in a Utopian, man-made research facility. The staff monitors their patients' moods, their diet, and their overall behavior. Impatiently, Lincoln and the others bide their time for the opportunity to win a daily lottery and pick up the prize: a trip to a lush paradise known as The Island, billed as 'nature's last remaining pathogen-free zone.' Lincoln stands apart from his friends and fellows, because he allows his curiosity to get him into big trouble. Everything in this huge, antiseptic research facility may not be all it seems, and Lincoln begins to believe the worst. One of Lincoln's unhappy fellow workers insists that the lottery is fixed. Meanwhile, Lincoln gets friendly with Jordan Two Delta (pretty Scarlett Johansson of 'Lost in Translation') and the two become quite chummy. In the sealed off research facility, nobody may engage in sexual behavior, and the vigilant staff maintain a 'proximity' rule that prevents a man and a woman from embracing. Lincoln Six Echo stumbles onto the truth when a cynical research facility technician, McCord (Steve Buscemi of 'Con-Air'), warns our naïve hero about trusting humans. Eventually, Lincoln figures out a way to break out and Jordan accompanies him. A desperate Merrick (Sean Bean of 'GoldenEye') hires ex-military, South African mercenary, Laurent (Djimon Hounsou of 'Gladiator') to recapture Lincoln and Jordan before they can get to the world beyond their clean-scrubbed confines.The first third of 'The Island' poses an intriguing premise that Hollywood hasn't handled as forcefully since Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner.' This politically incorrect actioneer about a notorious controversy and its possible repercussions on the life insurance industry seems almost inevitable. Typically, this kind of delicate but contentious subject matter fares better in the realm of science fiction, and the story occurs15 years into the future. About a half hour into this hokum, however, you should be 'wise' to what is really happening in the closely-guarded world of Lincoln and Jordan. Mind you, 'The Island' is predictable from start-to-finish. Most of you will be one jump ahead of the protagonists. Literary critics call this audience empowerment 'dramatic irony,' because we know more than the heroes. Nevertheless, both Lincoln and Jordan stack up as very likable and sympathetic characters. You'll want them to triumph over clearly impossible odds. Incredibly, the able supporting cast and characters prove just as congenial, meaning you'll care about them, too. The second third of 'The Island' imitates a horror movie without excessive blood and gore. Like all provocative sci-fi thrillers, 'The Island' delivers a vision of the future that is as chilling as anything in a holocaust movie. Despite the dreadful subject matter, Bay handles it in a way that makes his points without sickening us. The final third is your average knuckle-busting chase movie with melodramatic story reversals that undoubtedly will aggravate nit-pickers who demand realism, even when realism robs whatever charm any movie contains. For example, our clueless heroes extract themselves from one cliffhanger situation after another that people with their limited brainpower couldn't pull off considering the savvy and resources at the disposal of their assailants! You'll have to remind yourself repeatedly that 'The Island' is only a movie, but at least it isn't a prequel, sequel, remake, or superhero saga!",8,1,2,20 June 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Hilarious NASCAR Send-Up with Will Ferrel at the wheel!
","ANCHORMAN director Adam McKay and Will Ferrell must have had a blast making this zany farce about a NASCAR champion driver who experiences the high times along with the low times on the racing circuit. Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) is born in the backseat of the sports car owned by his father Reese Bobby (Gary Cole of OFFICE SPACE) late one evening on the way to the delivery room. You see Reese is a speed demon who can never spend an length of time in a single spot without incurring the wrath of those around him. Nevertheless, Reese instills the quality of speed in his son throughout his public school education. Meantime, Ricky makes fast friends with his classmate Cal Naughton Jr. (John C. Reilly of STEPBROTHERS) in school. Initially, they constitute part of the pit crew for a NASCAR driver who has no desire to win. During one race, the driver walks off to eat lunch and Ricky decides to take over for him. Later, when Cal joins him on the racetrack, they become a NASCAR sensation because Cal willingly helps Ricky win just about every race. They call their strategy shake and bake. Ricky is married to a red hot momma, Carley (Leslie Bibb of LAW ABIDING CITIZEN) and they have two bratty outspoken little boys. Nothing serious happens in this slam-bang comedy with Ferrell having a field day with his moronic protagonist. Half-way through the action, Ricky meets a guy who is more than his match. Gallic gear-jammer Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen of BRUNO) comes to America strictly to beat Ricky on his own turf. Whereas Ricky embraces all the characteristics of an Anglo-Saxon, white male with two kids and a bubble-headed wife, Jean is gay with a husband. Things take an unexpected turn for our hero when he crashes his ride during a race and emerges unscathed physically but devastated mentally. The same way that an alcoholic suffers from the D.T.s is the way that Ricky reacts to being torched. He cannot climb back behind the wheel and ends up delivering pizzas until the authorities take his driving license away from him. Not only does Cal take over his job as the leader racer but his old friend also takes possession of his wife. Eventually, Reese returns and puts Ricky through a boot camp to help his son recover his courage. One of the funniest gags occurs when Reese forces Ricky to drive his car with a female cougar named Karen in the vehicle. As long as Ricky acts calmly, Reese assures him that the cat will not maul him. There are lots of hilarious jokes and then there are some jokes that don't work. Happily, most of the good jokes are really funny. Amy Adams has a good role. The finale between Jean Girand and Ricky is pretty funny, too. Religious types may object to the prayer that is said during a big meal.",Null,0,0,18 September 2011
Semi-Pro," Just Another Sports Comedy with Too Little of Will Ferrell
","Will Ferrell's fourth and latest sports spoof comedy 'Semi-Pro' (**1/2 stars out of ****) is semi-delusional. For the record, it's not in the same league with his NASCAR comedy 'Talladega Nights.' The former Saturday Night Live comedian stars here as one-shot disco music singer Jackie Moon who bought his hometown basketball team with the bucks that he earned from his Barry White-style, one hit wonder, chart-topping single 'Love Me Sexy.' Not only does Jackie own the Tropics of Flint, Michigan, but he also plays on, coaches, and promotes the team! 'Semi-Pro' takes place in the nonconformist 1970s, and the fictional Tropics compete in the former real-life American Baseball Association (1967-1976) with its trademark red, white, & blue basketball and its 3-point shot. Clearly, this nostalgic, occasionally amusing basketball farce aspired to be for hoops movies what the legendary Paul Newman classic 'Slapshot' was for ice hockey and the Tom Berenger farce 'Major League' was for baseball. Mind you, the pranks, the pratfalls, and the humor are quintessential Will Ferrell when he is front and center, but Ferrell isn't always front and center, and the movie lacks the non-stop, over-the-top comic buffoonery of 'Talladega Nights.' 'Semi-Pro' devotes more time to sincerity than frivolity. Half of this dribbling comedy focuses on straight man Woody Harrelson. An aged NBA, Boston Celtics champ, Monix (Woody Harrelson of 'White Men Can't Jump') joins the team after Jackie trades the Tropics' ailing washing machine for him. As it turns out, the ABA is tottering on its last legs, and ABA Commissioner (David Koechner of the far funnier sports spoof 'The Comebacks') and the other team owners have struck a lucrative deal to have four of their teams absorbed into the NBA. The remaining teams, including Jackie's Tropics, are scheduled to disband. Jackie goes ballistic at this dire prospect. Somehow, our hero with an Afro hairstyle convinces his fellow owners that only the best four teams should be absorbed. Actually, this happened in real-life. Unfortunately, Jackie later learns that each team must attract at least two thousand spectators for each home game. In an effort to improve the Tropics, Jackie trades for Monix. Monix spent his championship season with the Celtics, but he warmed the bench more often than shot hoops. Nevertheless, Monix sincerely wants to turn the Tropics around and make them into winners. Anybody remember the warm-hearting Gene Hackman movie 'The Hoosiers?' Ultimately, this last hurrah for the underdogs that must win a championship game is standard, second-rate stuff that has been done too many times. Indeed, 'Semi-Pro' surpasses 'Kicking and Screaming,' 'Melinda and Melinda,' and 'Bewitched,' but that provides little consolation.An executive producer on 'Balls of Fury' and 'Mr. Woodcock,' freshman director Ken Alterman and 'Old School' scenarist Scot Armstrong slum for laughs in their raunchy, foul-mouthed, R-rated, 93 minute, boys-night-out bash. They have intrepid Jackie Moon pulling an idiotic Evel Knievel-style ramp jump with roller skaters over his team's foxy string of cheerleaders strung out head-to-toe on their backs across the court. Since the players cannot fight on the court during the game, Jackie has his guys slug it out with the other team during commercial breaks. At one point, Jackie promises to feed everybody at a home game a Corndog if the Tropics score over 125 points. They do and Jackie bails. Ultimately, in an effort to sell out his stadium, Jackie wrestles with a brown bear. Although the bear escapes, the woodland beast becomes 'Semi-Pro's' best running joke as it strikes without warning.Sadly, Alterman and Armstrong treat Ferrell as if he were a guest star. 'Semi-Pro' relies more on half-hearted sight gags and the suspenseful but formulaic big-game-to-win showdown than the inspired lunacy that is Will Ferrell. Unfortunately, Ferrell shares the spotlight with Harrelson, and Harrelson gets a subplot with an old girlfriend and a romance. Surprisingly, 'Semi-Pro' doesn't stoop to the standard kick in the groin for chuckles or any examples of juvenile bowel humor. The dumbest scene has Monix teaching the Tropics how to run a play until they puke. Incredibly, Jackie has never puked in his entire life. Monix punches him in the belly, and Jackie chucks everything, but not on camera. Altogether, this lukewarm sports comedy scores more chuckles than sensational, side-splitting laughs. Sure, you'll smile and sputter, but you won't be roaring at anything fresh or original.",6,7,14,5 March 2008
Furious 7," A White-Knuckled, Super-Charged, Adrenaline-Laced Actioneer
","If you didn't know actor Paul Walker perished in a fiery car crash back on November 30, 2013, you'd never know it by watching 'Furious 7, the latest installment in the 'Fast and Furious' franchise. 'Saw' director James Wan and 'Wanted' scenarist Chris Morgan had about half of this mammoth $250 million movie made when tragedy struck and claimed Walker's life. Altogether, 'Furious 7' emerges not only as a cinematic eulogy to Walker's ephemeral career but also as a white-knuckled, super-charged, adrenaline-laced actioneer. Initially, 'The Fast and the Furious' (2001) crossed the finish line as an above-average, illegal road-racing epic about an undercover cop that bolstered actor Vin Diesel's box office clout while it forged Paul Walker's career. Walker carried on with Tyrese Gibson after a disaffected Diesel bowed out of 2003's sequel '2 Fast 2 Furious,' but the chrome-domed Diesel gave his blessing to the chronologically out-of-sequence 'Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift' (2006) with a post end credits cameo. Some consider 'Tokyo Drift' the nadir of the franchise, but I contend that 'Tokyo Drift' surpassed its skid mark of a predecessor. The three sequels that ensued fueled the franchise with even more vitality. Not even Walker's demise could put the brakes on 'Furious 7.' Mind you, 'Furious 7' doesn't qualify as an artistic magnum opus. Nevertheless, aside from either the James Bond blockbusters or the Harry Potter series, can you name a contemporary franchise with as many sequels as 'The Fast and the Furious?' Whether we see an eighth entry, 'Furious 7' has knocked the bottom out of the franchise. Wan and Morgan have concocted some preposterous high-octane stunts that defy gravity as well as logic but look extraordinary. Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, and Asian 'Ong Bak' martial arts sensation Tony Jarr augment the original cast and invigorate these improbable shenanigans. If 'Furious 7' marks your initiation to the franchise, you're going to have a blast catching up with the rest of us. 'Furious 7' ranks as the top of the heap in a franchise that has never throttled back. In 'Fast & Furious 6,' Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of 'Hercules') persuaded Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel of 'xXx') to assemble his crew, including former LAPD cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of 'Running Scared'), Roman (Tyrese Gibson of 'Transformers'), Teg (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), and Han (Sung Kang of 'Ninja Assassin') to help him nab a band of global mercenaries. The criminal mastermind of the group, ex-British Special Forces commander Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of 'Dracula Untold'), likes to think big. As just compensation, Hobbs promised pardons to Dom and his gang. Meantime, Hobbs showed Dom a photo of our protagonist's long lost squeeze, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez of 'Girlfight'), and this strengthened Dom's resolve to seize Shaw. When 'Furious 7' unfolds, we meet Shaw's indestructible brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham of 'The Transporter'), who has just murdered Han in Hong Kong. Later, he wipes out an entire team of guards at the British hospital where his crippled brother clings to life. The indefatigable Deckard vows to make anybody who had anything to do with his brother's calamity pay with their lives. After he ices Han, Deckard heads to Los Angeles and hacks into Hobbs' computer. Hobbs catches him in the act, and they tangle, swap sledgehammer blows, and virtually demolish DSS headquarters. Hobbs narrowly escapes death when Deckard detonates a grenade. Not long after his larger-than-life brawl with Hobbs, Deckard has a package delivered to Dom's house. The explosion doesn't kill anybody, but little is left of the iconic house where Brian and Dom's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) met and washed dishes together. At this point, Brian's wife Mia has given birth to a toddler, Jack, but she hasn't told her husband that she is pregnant with another child. Brian is struggling to get the hang of taking Jack to day care in a mini-van, and Brian's first scene at day care is hilarious. Although he is confined to the hospital, Hobbs summons Dom to his bedside and tells him 'like a brother' to take Deckard down. Deckard stalks our heroes at Han's funeral, and Dom and he crash cars head-on into each other. Before they can do additional damage, an army of soldiers supervised by the natty Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell of 'Escape from New York') intervenes and saves Dom from certain death. Mr. Nobody and Dom share a mutual friend, Hobbs, and Nobody is prepared to help Dom locate the elusive Deckard. Nobody shows Dom a sophisticated gadget that can track anybody anywhere. Basically, it's reminiscent of CBS-TV's 'Person of Interest' computer. Mr. Nobody refers to it as 'God's Eye,' and he assures Dom that the government would have caught Osama bin Laden overnight had they had such a doodad. The problem is that the individual with the key component to 'God's Eye' is a mysterious somebody named Ramsey. Ramsey, it turns out, is being held captive by notorious terrorist Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou of 'Amistad') who wants the same gizmo. Several outlandish action set-pieces later, our heroes get what they want, but neither Deckard nor Jakande make it a picnic.Director James Wan rarely lets the episodic action loiter, and he integrates the late Paul Walker seamlessly into several exciting escapades. One incredible cliffhanger scene occurs on a switchback highway atop a craggy mountain where our daredevil heroes struggle to extract Ramsey from a fortified bus armed with six Vulcan mini-cannons. At one point, Walker's Brian O'Connor finds himself dangling from the wrecked bus as it teeters precariously over the edge of a precipice. Brian must scramble across the top of the bus before it plunges into the canyon below. Wan orchestrates several suspenseful, careening car chases. Another staggering stunt has our heroes propelling a priceless sports car through two luxury, skyscrapers in exotic Abu Dhabi to recover Ramsey's device. 'Furious 7' rivals a James Bond extravaganza with its breathtaking, melodramatic mayhem!",9,85,114,6 April 2015
The Godfather," The 'Gone With the Wind' of Mobster Movies
","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' truly qualifies as the 'Gone with the Wind' of gangster movies. The first installment in the Oscar-winning trilogy covers decades, mob wars, romances, intrigue, and treachery. Specifically, 'The Godfather' received three Oscars. First, it was voted Best Picture; the Academy recognized Marlon Brando as Best Actor, and Coppola shares a Best Writing statuttee with Mario Puzo. Clocking in at a robust 175 minutes, 'The Godfather' cast Brando as the seasoned Don Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino elbowing his way right behind him as the youngest son Michael. James Caan makes a lot of fuss as Pacino's older brother Sonny, and the ever dependable Robert Duval is cast as the consigliere for the family. Interestingly, Caan, Duval, and Pacino all competed for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was up for Best Director. Dean Tavoularis' production designs, Warren Clymer's art direction, and Philip Smith's set decoration are all sumptuous. The best scenes include Michael's massacre at the restaurant, Carlo and his wife smashing dishes, Sonny's ambush in the causeway, Brando's death scene in the tomato patch, and the finale with the elimination of all of Michael's enemies. The screenplay deserved an Oscar. The least shall be first as Michael demonstrates during his meteoric rise to power. The dialogue contains quotable lines and several interesting characters who aren't relatives of the Corleone clan. Gordon Willis' shadowy, straight-on photography captures the treachery of the crime syndicate. Of course, 'The Godfather, Part II' surpasses it in every respect, and it deserved the six Oscars that it garnered.",10,1,3,10 June 2013
