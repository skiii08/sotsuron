Miracle," I play hockey and didn't enjoy it
","I have played hockey since i was 3 and this movie was a huge letdown when it came to the hockey aspect. Yeah sure they may have used real players but most of it was about herb brooks and not the actual games, why don't they call it herbicle because 80% of the shots in the movie have herb in them......ridiculous. however, there is a couple of pro's to the movie, it was a good way for CCM to market their new 'classic' glove line. last time i checked they didn't have those glittery glamorous pro tacks way back when. Through in through if you want to watch a real hockey movie that is not revolving around a single coach and more around a team, watch slap shot or mystery Alaska. Although one of the biggest characters in slap shot is the coach but that is besides the point.4/10",4,1,8,19 May 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Just Phenomenal
","I am a die hard Tarantino fan, the movies he writes and directs are always among my favorites, and I have been following this movie since it was rumored to be his next. Yet once i saw the trailers and commercials i was disappointed on what i believed the movie was gonna be. Shame on me for doubting QT!As in all Tarantino movies, the dialog is fantastic. The opening milk scene is well written and really locked me into the movie. As well as the rendezvous at the bar whilst playing the card game, during the confrintation with the major, and the Mexican standoff. Without going too in depth about it it is just classic QT and is what makes me love his films.The music is the only thing i could complain about, if there is anything to complain about. Most, if not all the songs reminded me of Kill Bill. When a song came on i just immediately shot to whatever scene in Kil Bill the similar song. I asked some other people if they felt the same way about the music and they said they could see it but not as bad as me. I don't know, it was just a personal thing.Overall the movie is a hilarious, well written, extremely violent action sack. I loved it for almost every second except when it ended, i did not want it to end. I like how Hitler and his whole high command were all killed, and how it is it's own history book. In order for a movie to be good, it does not have to be historically accurate, and this movies proves it.Keep it going QT! You keep this going and i will be a fan for life",10,3,9,26 August 2009
