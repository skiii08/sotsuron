Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Did they even read the book before they start the film? or did i read something else?
","Seriously? I understand that in most cases the movie has to be change to fix time and movie needs. But did they just take out a the movie for the sake of taking out a movie. Did they just not read the book. From beginning to end i felt like i was watching something else. Yes Abraham was on the big screen but nothing else. I kept hoping that something would change and i might get a glimpse of the book i couldn't put down. Walked out of the theater in anger and disappointment, with a look of shock on my friends face. Making sure with one another that we had walked into the correct screen. We grabbed our books and made sure we had all read the right book. Did they forget to read the book before they produced it.",1,25,55,22 June 2012
