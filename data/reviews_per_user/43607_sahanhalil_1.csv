Conquest 1453," It was good movie but not the best
","First of all, Fetih 1453 is the first Turkish realistic historical epic movie. Almost everything was perfect especially costumes and places. The costumes were very impressive because movie team gave us the moment of 15th century. The Places were awesome they have given the moment and takes us those times.On the other hand, There were some mistakes about real history: 1) Ulubatlı was -in my opinion- in the main character of the movie but it was Faith's story and he should be in the main scene.2) Ulubatlı should be an ordinary soldier but he is close with era and helping artillery making, but the real mistake was he is like a friend of Faith.3) Faith was a religious man and he was usually with his hodja I mean Akshemseddin. But Akshemseddin is entering into the movie last half hour.4)There are a lot of sources about faith I think they should had been used.Finially, It was the first epic war movie. I liked it.it opened the way for higher budget movies and historical epic movies.",10,27,68,20 February 2012
