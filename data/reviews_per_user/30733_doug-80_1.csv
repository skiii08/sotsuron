Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A wonderful, awe-inspiring movie!
","Like many people I was not alive when A NEW HOPE was first released. However, my parents took me to see both EMPIRE and JEDI, each knowing the power and wonder that the Star Wars saga gives to each and every person in the audience regardless of their age, race or creed.  I have grown up with Star Wars and feel a connection to its many themes and messages of bravery, selflessness and redemption.  Now, with the dawn of the first of three prequels, the wonder and beauty of Star Wars has returned to fill our hearts with those same high ideals.  I loved the Phantom Menace, not only for its stunning visuals, but its solid and well sculpted plot and lessons of taking action in the face of adversity even against seemingly unsurmountable odds. Each character was well developed (yes, even Jar Jar) and the roles were executed by the actors with precision and care.  Lucas has once again taken us to a magical universe where the old American Spirit still reigns with dignity and wonder.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
