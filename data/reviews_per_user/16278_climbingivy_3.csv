Black Swan," Big Disappointment,Typical Depressing Hollywood Filth
","Black Swan could have been a wonderful story about the hardships that ballet artists suffer without all of the perverse self cutting and filthy mouthed females.Why oh why can't Hollywood produce a good movie that is not disgusting and shallow?Fox Pictures go back into your film vaults and watch some of your vintage films and see what you don't know how to do anymore.What a waste of Natalie Portman's talent.What is with the disgusting lesbian scenes in the movie?Is that necessary?Barbara Hershey is looking really horrid with all of her plastic surgery.Hey Barbara it did not make you look younger.Look in the mirror Barbara.Hollywood is obsessed with plastic surgery that does not make actors and actresses look younger.The plastic surgery that is prevalent in our society is not making people look better,only freakish.Black Swan could have been good.Chalk Black Swan up as another Hollywood failure.",1,4,9,24 May 2014
Behind The Candelabra," Why oh why was this trash made Mr. Soderbergh?
","Awful,awful, awful!! Why did you make this piece of Hollywood tripe Mr. Soderbergh and Mr.Douglas?I watched the movie for a while and then I turned the movie off and sent the DVD back to Netflix post haste.I can understand Matt Damon being in this movie because Matt Damon represents the Hollywood nonsense and attitude of the modern era.And I say that with sadness.What I do not understand is why a masterful actor like Michael Douglas stooped so low as to be involved in this Hollywood hit piece based on a very conniving and sad man who claims he was used by Liberace.Well Mr.Thorson you knew what you were doing.You used Liberace so you would not have to work and you could be the typical parasite leaching and draining the blood from a man who had lots of money.A man who worked hard for his money and yes he was leading a gay bizarre life.But I can say that Mr.Scott Thorsen is a lying hypocrite.Liberace did not make him have plastic surgery and wear fur coats and diamonds from his neck eh?Mr.Steven Soderbergh you are a low trashy director who does a hit piece on a man who had more talent in his little toe than all of you Hollywood trash of today.And that includes you Matt Damon and your ilk.",1,9,24,2 December 2013
The Social Network," Mark Zuckerberg is a Pompous ASS
","'The Social Network' is an excellent film and the reason that I know this is because in the first twenty minutes of the film I wanted to strangle Mark Zuckerberg in real life because he is undoubtedly a pompous ass.I am amazed that the man who was a college student who was crass,cruel and a braggart became a billionaire so young.I do not like braggarts,I never have and I never will.Braggarts make the world a miserable place because they never stop talking about how supposedly wonderful they are and the whole time they know full well that they are pathetic,sad human beings.The part in the very beginning of the film made me incredibly sad because the whole train wreck started because Zuckerberg decided to rate girls on the web.What a vicious and rude thing to do.I know that Mr.Zuckerberg is widely admired worldwide and worshipped as God,but God he is not.Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg are just a symptom of American society that is now lost and on the way out of existence.",10,0,0,28 April 2012
