Requiem for a Dream," Best drama I have ever seen. Still haunted by it, 6 weeks later.
","As the subject says, this is the most emotive piece of drama I have ever seen. The writer and director set up realistic characters that you feel for, then systematically destroy each of them.I have a pretty strong stomach when it comes to movies but I have to say I felt physically ill after the end of this movie and even now, it still upsets me to think of the characters and what happened to them. That is how powerful this is. There is nothing really graphic about it, but oh boy, does it claw at your heart.Just a warning - this is a very depressing story. Be prepared for that. If you want a demonstration of outstanding storytelling, this is it.",10,0,1,28 November 2009
Terminator Salvation," A disgrace to the franchise, but not a bad action film
","OK here is what the movie would have been like if it were true to canon (if we exclude the fact that Skynet did not know who John Connors father was):<ul><li>Skynet finds Kyle Reese - Terminator instantly kill Kyle Reese, no more John Connor - End of movie. End of war.</li></ul>Seriously - that was the whole premise of the T1-3 movies, so why oh why do we see:<ul><li>Skynet finds Kyle Reese - Skynet transports Kyle Reese to a cost prison in some base - Skynet lures John Connor into said (non-heavily defended base), so they can kill him - Skynet sends one, yes one Terminator to kill John Connor. However instead of the terminator simply squishing JC's skull the instant he gets hold of him, he spends 15 minutes lobbing him around. Note in the original, the Terminator punched his fist straight into some poor guys chest - and then he only wanted his clothes!</li></ul>That said, if it had been made as a standalone 'evil robots take over the Earth' movie, it would have have OK. It's just they have taken no care whatsoever about sticking to the plot.",4,1,3,28 November 2009
