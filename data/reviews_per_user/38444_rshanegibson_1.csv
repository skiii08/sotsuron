The Ring," Great Movie IF you like to think!
","I've read most of these comments/reviews and one of the major complaints I keep seeing is:  too many unanswered questions  or  too many loose threads
I suppose that for some people, this is true.  But for those of you out there that actually enjoy a thought-provoking film, this is one great movie! It's true you aren't spoonfed every answer to every story element.  But for those folks that are capable of intelligent thought, that's actually a big plus.  Although I did find the movie scary at times, it was much more CREEPY than scary!  Maybe the creepiest film I've ever seen!!!
******SPOILERS*******SPOILERS*********SPOILERS*********So, here's what I thought about the plot:Based on the way I remember the movie unfolding, we learn that Mrs Morgan cannot have a child.  Everytime she becomes pregnant, she ends up miscarrying.  Then, according to the local doctor, the couple goes away for some time and comes back with a baby girl.  It's assumed she's been adopted, but at one point we get a look at a birth certificate and (if I remember correctly) the info on it contradicts this adoption idea.  Add to this the words of Mr Morgan right before he dies (something about 'She was never meant to have a child') and I came to the following admittedly far-out conclusion...Mrs Morgan made some type of 'Deal with the Devil' to have a child and, as a result, became pregnant with what would become a child of pure evil.  I'm basing this on the facts that 1)the girl could create things simply by wanting them to be, i.e  the strange pictures and of course the video tape 2)just being close to the girl caused people to lose their minds to some degree; the horses around her went so crazy they ran and drowned themselves 3)the girl said herself that she wanted to hurt people  4)a woman who wanted a child more than anything in the world ended up killing the child she finally hadThe end of the film shows that Rachel has been spared, and I've read some ideas as to why.  I think that she was only spared so that she could get more of the tapes in circulation, allowing the Evil Girl to cause even more pain/suffering/death.But this is, of course, just my take on the whole thing.  Other thoughtful folks out there will come up with other ideas I'm sure, and that's the beauty of this type of film!",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
