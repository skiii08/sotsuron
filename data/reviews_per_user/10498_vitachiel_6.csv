Marie Antoinette," Forgettable
","Decadent and shallow portrait of a decadent and shallow life(style). Almost no depth is provided here. This movie presents a show of all the pleasantries and luscious food and elaborated dresses of the French court during Marie Antoinette's time, which is all right but not all the way through without any background study or character delving. Although Dunst is good in her role, she doesn't have anything solid to work with. It is impossible to portray someone as a self-indulgent nitwit, a caring wife/mother, a lonely woman and a rebel queen all at the same time during the time span of a regular movie, so at the end we are left with a feeling of confusion and emptiness and we still don't know anything of our heroine.Another big flaw is the cast. The French court is made up of British, American, and some English-with-a-French-accent-speaking people, which is rather confusing. Also quite awkward listening to a high-placed French court official who speaks about the need to stay friends with the Americans while he himself is speaking with an innate American tongue.Focussing is very important, especially when you have to look at something with a wide range of perspectives. This movie tries to do it all and so it fails.One word of praise: Bow Wow Wow, best music choice ever!",4,1,3,1 December 2008
Shakespeare in Love," Predictability kills
","Greatly overrated minorpiece that deals with a fictitious tale about Shakespeare falling in love with one of his contemporary fans.Here's what's wrong with it: Story: basically it's quite a nice story with some interesting plot lines. Unfortunately, the director decided not to make it too difficult for his intended big audience, so predictability kills surprise in almost every scene. No character twists either, everyone stays safely inside their dictated personage. I had the futile hope that Juliette would really stab herself to death with the dagger in the last scene of the play, but alas.Casting: the biggest flaw of the film. I understand the fact that American actors are hired to play Britons, I guess you just can't do without some Hollywood celebs in such a venture. But Gwyneth Paltrow? Joseph Fiennes?? Ben Affleck??? OK, Fiennes is British, but has absolutely no charisma and must have been used just for his good looks. Firth and Dench are quite alright but have only minor parts.Humor: I get sick of this kind of childish, predictable, unwitty and totally unfunny humor. I'm guessing I'm not the only one.All in all a very mediocre film, despite the fact that it was the big winner at the Oscars (which is a big farce anyhow).",5,6,11,24 August 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Cinematic turd
","This must be some badly worked out fantasy of a self-indulgent adolescent mind that doesn't know about the existence of any substantial things in this world. Having a rich daddy with some high level connections, it was fairly easy to make a film about his fantasy. No trouble to find some fame hungry Hollywood whores to help him realise his dream. No trouble at all to find a producer without regard for good taste and always willing to make a quick cheap buck. Thank God for that, because otherwise we would have missed this super smart and funny film about love, friendship, dedication and the true meaning of life. Oh, wait...",1,7,11,6 January 2016
Lost in Translation," Gimme a break
","This movie was a great disappointment. It has a big reputation, but I just can't see why. It's cliché-ridden, unfunny and makes cheap fun of Japanese culture. A typical example of the self-centered view Americans have of the world. I couldn't find anything profound or deep at all in this movie. Just two spoiled Americans feeling sorry for themselves in a strange, 'exotic' country. Give me a break. If I wouldn't have known any better, I would just have considered this one of Woody Allen's lesser movies...",4,6,13,27 October 2017
The Devil Wears Prada," Where are the celebrities?
","OK movie, not good, not bad. Cliché-ridden but entertaining enough. At least the Hollywood money-makers know to make something watchable from a very predictable and unfunny script.Character building could have been a lot better. Meryl Streep (Miranda Priestly)should have been brought in a lot more to add drama and evilness to the story. Instead, we see regular glimpses of her, too short to really deepen out the background of her devilishness and make the movie more interesting (and entertaining).The focus is almost completely on Anne Hathaway, who is an OK actress, but lacking in expressiveness and comic skills. Pay attention to first assistant Emily Blunt instead, she is the only real star in this production.",6,0,0,20 October 2008
Saw," Freaky enough
","Following the hype, I must say that I expected more from this movie. Still, the entertainment value was very high, I did not get bored a single time. The basic concept is good and freaky enough. The dark, cold and stinky atmosphere was justly portrayed. However, there were some things missing that could've made this movie a true classic. Maybe there are too many flashbacks, police investigation scenes, etc. to get truly absorbed into the main story of the two men chained in a sleazy bathroom. What's more, I was not really impressed by the choice of actors. I never got to the point of empathizing with the characters, and therefore I was not so concerned with their fates (which lessens the tension). More character building would've helped a lot.Also, more focus on the dreadfulness of lying hours in a row as a caged dog in a desolate place would've been welcome: I understand, including a minute or two of silent trepidation would be risky in the commercial eye, but I am convinced it would add to the overall texture of the movie. I also expected more gore and bloodiness; if somebody has to pull a key out of another person's stomach, show more of the actual action. If the doctor is sawing his leg, well, include at least a second more of the sawing or of the sawed-off foot/leg (then again, my own stomach says thank you for not showing that) The last factor which did damage to the absorption level was the logic of action taken. If Big Brother can hear all that's happening in the bathroom, why can't he hear what's being said between the two victims when the light is turned off? And is it not oh so obvious for BB that they made a deal with regard to the poisoned cigarette? When (near the end of the movie) the doctor reaches for the cell phone, he gets frustrated for not reaching it. Hey, you managed to pick up things that were harder to pick up by either man just throwing another object towards it, so why cutting off your foot to do it now? To add some praise: the end scene was totally unexpected, though very conceivable and thus of true perfection.",7,0,1,27 July 2007
