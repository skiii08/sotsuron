Hereditary," Such a great Horror Film
","As a genre film fan, I loved this movie so much. And I can't stress it enough that you have to see this one on the big screen with other movie-lovers - with, hopefully, some horror fans in the mix. The shrieks, the groans, the nervous laughter - it's all there. I won't say anything substantive about the film because I want to give absolutely nothing away, but Toni Collette is phenomenal, Ann Dowd is excellent (as always), and Alex Wolff is a serious find - can't say enough about how effectively he pulls the various threads of this movie together.",10,0,3,12 December 2018
Get Out," One of the most ambitious debuts from a filmmaker ever.
","Very original plot. Creepy, suspenseful, and funny. Acting was great especially by Kaluuya. It's uncomfortably enjoying and intriguing. Solid cast and Peele did a hell of a job on setting up this environment.",9,0,2,10 February 2019
