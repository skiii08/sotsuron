Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Could be more better
","Finally the final chapter (I think) about this huge saga, and for the final, the expectancy about this end was high, and it's sad that the plot tried to erase some of the events about the previous movie, and give it back some characters that doesn't fit anymore, should be less of fan service, and more cohesion about the story, but not everything is bad, the relationship of Kyle and Rey is the best, the evolution of power of Rey, the three protagonists, finally always together , of course have a great battle and amazing visual effects, and at least the real ending is kinda cute, and give a taste of want more about.",8,1,9,23 December 2019

No question, the soundtrack was amazing, the songs picked are sung on right moments, Himesh Patel is wonderful, your moral dilemma about use the songs is perfect, and have a great resolution, Ed Sheeran apparition is kinda good, but also have a secret and unexpected apparition close to the end that is the most emotional scene on the movie.",8,0,0,18 November 2019

Aladdin," ...Arabian nights like Arabian dreams...
","One more Disney live action, and one more success in adapt a classic animation, and bring all this to reality, with more feminism and representativeness, not only in your plot, but in your songs and the solo of Jasmine, where show us a character pretty powerful and segure of yourself. Will Smith as Genie is incredible, de CGI is not perfect, but on no moment harms the experience, absolutely is the best character in the movie and the more exploited with different way of the another movie. The magic carpet and Abu are so cool to see, even if they are not so caricatured, both have good scenes, Iago is a great animal villain, not so funny like the animation, but still a good to see it with Jafar that unfortunately is the only character that is not so good in comparison to animation, but have so many things to see that you don't care very much about.

The Lion King," The animation still the king.
","Off course remade one of the best animations it's very risky but Disney is determined to do this., just for pure nostalgia, I decided to watch this, and I think that the real problem is because this new movie don't try change anything, so why do a remake if you just will be copy everything.. sure, had some tine differently things, but nothing that can change the story, said that, at least they did a amazing work wit the CGI, the photography's is wonderfull, and the new voices into the old musics are incredible sometimes better, and like always, Timon and Pumbaa are the funniest characters on the movie.",7,1,4,20 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Shhhhhhh!
","This movie would be boring, because are 'so quiete', but is not, tension is on everywhere and the characters demonstrate that so well, I like everyone, principally Regan, she is the best, and the most interesting and explored, I like your evolution.

It Chapter Two," It's not scary at all?
","Finally the awaited sequel out, and with a great adult cast, I thought that would be more scary than the first movie, but unfortunately is not, the plot is a huge story about adventure and reencounter of the old friends, fortunately, the new cast are so good as the child cast, and they got the same aspects and all of this becomes identical. Talking about the story, it's great all the mystery about Pennywise, and they solving together, I just missed more deaths, and more horror and sometimes the CGI wasn't good kinda weird and funny(?).
