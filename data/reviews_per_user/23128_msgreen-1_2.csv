E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An above average film, but a bit over-rated
","I think E.T. is a real good family movie especially for all the children to watch but after seeing it again I realize that it is a little dated now, and not quite as good as I remembered it being when I first watched it when I was young and saw it in theater and when it fist came out on videotape. I think kids like it obviously more than that adults would. The story has holes and is pretty simple but for kids it's real good. I did not like any of the restored and changed things in all the updates of the movie, especially changing the guns into the flashlights. What is the point of that? I was a kid when I saw it but the flashlights did no scare me at all. Kids aren't as fragile as I think these directors are thinking nowadays. Anyway I give E.T. a six out of ten rating because it is a good movie that is worth seeing with some unforgettable scene but only if you have kids watching and there are many better films out there that are not so well liked. E.T. is an above average movie, for kids.",Null,7,13,26 March 2005
Hoosiers," A Great Sports Movie!
","I'm not a big sports fan except for hockey but even though this is a basketball movie I just loved it.Not a big Gene Hackman fan either but he was fantastic as the coach and Dennis Hopper was also very good as the alcoholic who gets another chance as the assistant coach (and father of one of the team's players). The plot is great.Basically Hackman is a coach who was banned from college coaching for hitting one of his players, he's a very serious and angry coach who only cared about winning. He gets another chance at this small Indiana high school that only has six or seven players total on the team. The town though is huge on basketball and really wants to win.They try to get rid of the coach because they don't like how he's coaching (in one game he only puts four players on the court after he doesn't like how one is playing and benches him). In the end though the players believe in him and want to keep him, then they end up making it all the way to the championship game against one of the state's biggest schools as huge underdogs.You just end up pulling for the team and the players the whole time so even though it's pretty formulaic for a sports movie it does it very well, it's a great sports movie that's great for the whole family.",Null,1,1,6 December 2006
