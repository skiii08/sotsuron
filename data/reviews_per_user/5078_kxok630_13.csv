Marie Antoinette," If Marie had seen this travesty, she would have chopped Sofia's head off
","It's hard to believe a movie could so blatantly and sarcastically patronize its own audience as this one does. 'It's like totally gnarly and the guys are like so hot and Marie is just like you know so awesome wow, fer sure.'Was any research on the subject done at all? Antoinette was an intriguing enigma from a pivotal event in history. Was she an innocent victim of tragic circumstances, or was she the scheming, dishonest, heartless monster that the leaders of the revolt painted her as? Don't look for any such historical analysis here: you'll just see her trying on high heels and tennis shoes, listening to like MTV totally rad '80's new wave pop, and eating food and like other stuff, you know? The attitude seems to be that 'they would never watch a historic biopic, so let's give them a dimwitted Material Girl. They'll identify with a clod like that.' Talk about a 'Let them eat cake' attitude.Like, a totally groaty to the max gross out. Go to the mall and like hang out or something, instead. Ya know?",1,11,19,17 May 2007
Oblivion," Cruising around a bombed out Earth with Tom
","All of the points are for the special effects. The set visuals and other effects were vivid and impressive. The rest of the production showed little thought or originality, with most of the cast and crew not showing up, nor even 'phoning it in.' It's a post-apocalyptic story, set in the year 2077, 60 years after an alien attack laid waste to the Earth, making it pretty much uninhabitable. The remnant population seeks refuge on Saturn's large moon Titan, and now sends some guy down to Earth to check on stuff as some kind of caretaker. Enter Tom Cruise as our hero. Remember how Wall-E endeavored to clean up an environmentally crippled Earth long after humans had taken to space? Well, the little robot Wall-E had a personality that was at once touching; not so with Cruise's character.There is never anything to care about in this character, or anything he does. First of all, Cruise never fills the role. He looks out of place; dressed like he's going to a high school prom while he wanders around a destroyed landscape. Cruise's acting consists of some bland stares at what surrounds him, and a romance with a woman that has as much chemistry as inert lead. The scripting doesn't help the lousy acting; the story really never pulls you in. The characters don't do much of anything, and blunder their way into some plot-devices rehashed from scores of other movies. There are revelations about things, but by this time you may be asleep.Before closing, it's fair to note that Morgan Friedman makes his usually fine effort in the movie. But even he can't save it from the other actors.In short, it's an effort at sci-fi that burns up in the atmosphere of its own laziness. If you like watching Cruise wander around with a confused look on his face, you might like this. But don't expect a story that's worth telling.",4,0,2,25 October 2013
Salt," Popcorn flick? Smells more like rotting eggplant
","Even an intentionally brainless film like this needs more than Angelina Jolie just running around shooting up stuff to be entertaining.Jolie phones it in. From a cell phone that dropped the signal. She is really awful in this, and it's obvious she couldn't care less. As usual, she wears clichéd black outfits. Her vampy Xena wannabe expression while she blasts people gets old way too fast; even she appears bored with the dull routine. The rest of the cast are not much better; calling them paper cut-outs is an insult to paper cut-outs. The plot is absolutely preposterous, and it only gets more absurd as it goes along. Jolie is a spy who gets framed for cold-war double agent shenanigans. Lots of bumbling clowns chase her and shoot. Committing the offense of making this film is far worse than espionage, and that's what they should have shot her for; but it's all academic anyway since they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from three feet away.Don't expect your money's worth of entertainment value from this, except maybe from laughing at it.",2,63,130,27 July 2010
Pearl Harbor," Tragic historical event reduced to a comic book story
","This movie is unbelievably bad. Problems are everywhere; let's start with the dreadful Titanic ripoff love triangle: they look like Barbie and Ken dolls, with plastic acting to match. The script is so corny and lame you'll be taping something over your ears to stop the pain. 21st Century anachronisms appear routinely, far too many to list. There is no heart for the people who died that day; the attack sequence is an exploitive, excessive, over-indulgent CGI field day that depict this tragic event as if it was comic book style mayhem.Ben Affleck fights in every battle you ever heard of, from Europe to Japan. I thought any minute they'd show scenes of him strafing Sioux Indians at the Little Big Horn, bombing Santa Ana's forces at the Alamo, or firing lasers at the Galactic Empire's Death Star.Since the whole thing is garbage, the director is to blame. Most inept movies can be laughed at for their awfulness, but this one will just make you mad that you wasted your time watching it.",2,52,103,30 March 2007
The Love Guru," How lousy can a movie get?
","It's obvious when a comic knows they're bombing: they resort to the crutch of using dirty jokes or ethnic jokes for cheap, easy laughs. Love Guru is evidence that Mike Myers is dreadfully insecure about the future of his career.Austin Powers (oh wait, that's the character being rehashed but not what they call him in this flop), learns Eastern Religion and a bad accent. His journey of enlightenment is apparently to insult people (usually with that familiar word that starts with 'f'). He chases women, gives advice on how to offend women and therefore get one, etc. There are no laughs, no memorable moments, no reasons to watch this whatsoever. In addition to Myers self-destructing, Jessica Alba continues her challenge to set a record for consecutive lousy performances in worthless movies. Her current run of these career-ending disasters is a number roughly equal to the number of miles that light travels in a year.This rubbish isn't even good enough for 'straight to video' release. The producers, had they had a moment of self-preservation and/or sanity, should have decided not to release it at all.",1,11,23,11 July 2008
The Number 23," Embarrassment
","It's hard to believe anyone would associate themselves with a movie this ridiculous. Even though this pathetic bomb is an easy target for mockery using the number 23, it's not even worthy of it. Any such joke would have far more creative content than this film does.Anybody could make up a dumb legend about any randomly chosen number they want, making the premise nonsensical. Even worse is the way Jim Carrey, in a Razzy-worthy performance, slithers around moaning out hilariously stupid lines of paranoia about this evil number which is plotting to kill us all and take over the universe. The overall tone of the film's cinematography and music shoot for eeriness, but come off comical when utilized behind the absurdity of this story.Laughable script. Appalling direction. Atrocious cast. This film is slop.",2,4,9,17 January 2008

Paranormal Activity," Sitting in a pumpkin patch doing nothing on Halloween night would be more interesting than watching this
","If you want a scary experience, see a dentist instead. It's scary (which this film isn't), and you might get better teeth. As for this film, all you'll get is asphyxiation. This thing stinks so bad you'll need a gas mask just to enter the theater. Some moron couple in San Fran get bugged by ghosts in their house. So they try to film the ghosts. Who knows why, maybe for America's Funniest Videos. The 'action' mostly takes place in the dumb couple's house, where the malevolent spirits get progressively irritated by their stupid behavior and plastic acting.Paranormal Activity should be renamed Parasitical Activity, since it shamelessly rips off an old idea. This is Blair Witch Lite, a regurgitation of what was a low-rent gimmick to begin with. They have the nerve to use that tiresome jiggly camera routine, invoking nausea. And that stupid 'night vision' effect. When you can actually see someone, they're tearfully whining or f-bombing. Meanwhile, the idiot boyfriend character films on and on, and nobody thinks of leaving to escape the danger. Idiotic clichés like this one will have you rolling your eyes so much you'll get a headache. It's easy to see why the ghosts got sick of these two clowns. The advertising for this offered no actual footage, and it's obvious why. Instead they showed Beevis and Butthead types pretending to react in mortal fear. If they were actually scared, then they were watching something else. The tension level of this thing plays out more like Scooby Doo meets Casper meets the TAPS Ghost Hunters (on a bad investigation) meets the Great Pumpkin. All hype, no substance. The only thing spooky about this is that somebody is brazen enough to charge people to see it.",1,7,17,3 November 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Hilarious
","Sidesplitting comedy starring Kryptonian super hero Ethan Cruise. He is impervious to bullets, and can outrun them too.Oh, this movie is bad. Really bad. The world's least exciting action hero and renowned James Bond wanna-be chases around for some miracle virus that can croak everybody. Originality such as that is on a par with a Scooby Doo cartoon, and remarkably, the story gets even stupider. There are about a hundred thousand faceless enemy agent guys for you-know-who to beat up or shoot up or blow up, while they fire thousands of rounds at him and.....miss. The lethal stuff? It of course is kept in a tiny vial that's designed to shatter if you look at it the wrong way.The female lead (both actor and character) is a paper doll cutout, apparently from a fashion magazine, who manages to act down to the level of our hero. Did I mention he's on screen about 100% of the time? When he's not delivering brilliant lines like, 'You won't die,' he's having high speed motorcycle chase/fist fight with some guy, saving the world while moving in endless slo-mo shots, and staring blankly at other actors when they talk.What's so humorous about this trash is how seriously it takes itself. The hilarity factor raises my vote on this about 5 notches from its actual cinematic value, enough to give it a 2 overall. Laughter is great medicine, and in that respect, this movie is just what the doctor ordered.",2,3,6,21 August 2007
The Happening," Gaseous conspiracy, stink bomb movie
","Another conspiracy! Mass suicides mysteriously ensue; a strange gas induced by nasty conspirators is responsible. The movie plays out more like a dose of laughing gas, especially when the identity of the conspirators is given.Don't waste your money. You'll be able to see this stink bomb for free on Sci-Fi channel within a year or so. Or maybe the Comedy channel. Except for the Twilight Zonish mood of the film, this movie lacks the spirit and strength of M. Night's early work. Unoriginal scripting, weak direction, and abysmal acting make this film little more than a comic mockery of itself. Burdened by an unintentionally humorous script, and clearly not provided any directorial guidance, the actors look foolish. Mark Wahlberg has done better, and it was painful to witness the usually dependable Zooey Deschanel sporting a blank, pie-eyed gape of fake-looking befuddled astonishment all the time.How do we strike back against our attackers? Force them to watch this rotten egg: it would be a dose of their own medicine.",2,6,12,16 June 2008
War of the Worlds," Aliens that can't shoot straight
","A bunch of aliens show up one day and start shooting ray guns. That's the plot. Problem is, their targeting aim is so bad they wouldn't be able to hit water if they fell out of a boat. They just shoot anywhere and everywhere, and zap victims and stuff, mostly by accident.Oh, and some knucklehead (Tom Cruise, even goofier than usual) and his two brat kids (Dakota Fanning who screams a lot and some cry baby guy with bug eyes) run around arguing and throwing temper tantrums. You keep hoping the aliens might silence the annoying family, the one thing that would make this whole botched affair worth viewing. There's lots of dazzling imagery attempting to impress; but no substance. It's just an array of disconnected vignettes without exposition, story, or purpose. Aliens shoot; people run, scream, get killed; repeat the process. Even the classic farmhouse encounter is bungled and becomes cartoonish. Any other version is better: the book, the radio play, the 1953 movie. Anything but this; but, if you do decide to torture yourself with this debacle, look for the grenade scene, one of the stupidest and funniest things ever filmed.",3,3,6,2 November 2007
Vanilla Sky," Poor remake of a beautiful story
","This movie is an insult to the original version, Abre los Ojos. The original's title means open the eyes, but when you see this clumsy and wretched abomination, you'll want to close them again. Perhaps even gouge them out.The Spanish movie boasted a fine cast, skillful direction, and exquisite cinematography in relating a beautiful, romantic, inspiring, and thought provoking tale that touches both the heart and mind. This rubbish copy fails to do any of this. All you see is Tom Cruise sauntering around with a bizarre blemish on his face, while reciting lines in an uninspired mono tonal manner that fails to convey the rich story. A movie that poses questions about reality and fantasy, among several other topics, requires (and deserves) more convincing acting. Penelope Cruz did a fine job in the original, yet looks like a broken marionette in this version. Cameron Diaz, doing her same old over-aged teen girl bit, is simply annoying.A rare positive note here is Kurt Russell, not only for the one superior performance in this film, but for putting up with all these hacks and not just giving up as most people would be tempted to do. Also, I applaud whoever punched Tom in the face, marking him up like that: well done. These elements, and the few remnants of the original story that made it into this convoluted excursion to nowhere are the only reason this isn't a '1.'Avoid this dreadful mess, and see the original instead.",3,2,5,15 May 2007
Valkyrie," History trivialized by dummkopfs
","Incompetent to the point of making your stomach turn.Based on real events and people. Really? Who, exactly? Any reference to a conspiracy of Hitler's inside circle to assassinate him is purely accidental. This was an event that could have had immense repercussions on the course of human history in the decades that followed. This movie treats the whole thing like some high school teen angst dramedy.Cruise looks like a little kid trying on his Daddy's old war uniform, and whining when he finds it's too big. Forget any German accent, or anything else to occupy the role of a Nazi officer. Let alone someone plotting a murder, or fearing for his own life. He talks like he just hung ten on some like totally rad gnarly curls at Malibu, dude. And he sports that eye patch like a he's going trick-or-treating for the first time. Other actors look like they're going to laugh at him at any moment. And they play Nazis--with British accents? There's just no serious tone, when you see Der Cruiser rushing around in jack-boots like he needs to go to the Herr's room. The guy playing Hitler looks more like Moe Howard of the Three Stooges. Not badly scripted; there was potential. The director obviously needed to do more research about these individuals; his lack of knowledge and professionalism trivializes this very serious subject matter. As for Tom, he just makes a fool of himself, once again.",1,22,41,18 February 2010
