The Blair Witch Project," slow and horrifying
","The Blair witch project is a horrifying movie. This is the first movie different from other horror Hollywood movies. I prefer to watch this movie because it is one of its kind. While i was watching this movie i felt like this is real. The forest with full of trees give a creepy look to this movie. Night clips of this movie are very horrifying, the strange voices from the woods were very horrifying and you will feel like you are there with them and facing all this. Horror from unknown is very terrifying and realistic kind off and not like other horror movies which has same line and same stories. I like the last scene of this movie which is shooted in a old creepy house. I like this movie because it is different from others and i recommend you to see this movie when you are alone and with all lights turn off. I give 7 out 10 to this movie. See it and feel it.",7,0,1,9 October 2008
