Mission: Impossible III," Decent Popcorn Flick
","The theater's volume was incredibly loud during this entire movie, making me wince every time a gun was fired (rest assured, the film had a loud noise every 2.8 seconds or so). MI:3 was a decent popcorn flick, though I was thankful enough to see it in Mexico, and pay $3 instead of $10. What a shame that this couldn't have been a stand-alone film, as everything out nowadays is a sequel or video game. There's a whole mess of brainless, cheesy action scenes and explosions that are fun to watch (good to know if you're an action fan), and a story I found more engaging than the previous two films. Yes, this stuff has been done numerous times before, and better, but MI:3 is decent action cheese. As a summer movie, it ain't bad. See it if you're incredibly bored and depressed.",7,0,0,3 June 2006
Hostel," A fun and gruesome mess
","PG-13 'horror' crap, step aside! Finally, a real horror film for those of us who don't mind watching people getting butchered like pigs with many different kinds of tools! The squeamish, obviously, should stay away from this flick and go back to their Quaker families. Virtually every bodily organ or limb imaginable is severed at some point in this flick, to the point where it becomes somewhat cheesy..but a lot of fun, nonetheless. Is it scary? Not really, but it's a blast to watch, so long as you have a strong stomach. The characters are likable, the dialogue is realistic, and the story is about as strange as you're gonna get. This is a kind of Holy Grail for us hardened horror fans. Let's hope there's even more stuff on the DVD.",7,0,1,15 January 2006
Silent Hill," Confused Yet?
","I'm not entirely sure how I felt about this film. I thought it started off pretty decent, with an interesting premise and atmospheric visuals. Unfortunately, the poor thing just dragged on and on, like a puppy with a broken leg that wants to be shot. The build-up didn't amount to a whole lot more than a plethora of nightmarish, ghoulish visuals. Granted, the visuals were cool and all, but there was very little explanation for any of it, and too little of a 'story' to hold much of it together. This movie is about the equivalent of entering a haunted house: while you're in it, it can be fun and spooky, but as soon as you're out, you realize how meaningless and forgettable the experience was. I suppose I would recommend this on DVD, but only if you rent it from the .99 bin at Albertsons, and aren't expecting to get your socks knocked off. Good luck!",5,0,3,18 May 2006
Snatch," Very Entertaining!
","Snatch is a surprisingly entertaining comedy/action movie, with oodles of dismemberments, shoot-outs and heists (all in good fun, of course)! Even with the red stuff flowing on the screen, it never loses its sense of humor, and is more goofy than disturbing. Pitt's character is hilarious, the intertwining stories are fun to watch, and Guy Ritchie is da man! Imagine 'Pulp Fiction' with diamonds, and you'll get the idea. It's been a while since I've watched 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' but now I have a sudden urge to rent it again. A lot of crime comedies are boring and unoriginal, but Snatch was entertaining throughout, and quite humorous. Give it a shot if you like Tarantino-esquire schtuff.",8,1,2,3 June 2006
BASEketball," Funny In a Stupid Way
","God help you if you're expecting any kind of high-brow humor when renting BASEketball. A lot of it is fun and goofy, but a lot of it is also dumb and lame. At times, the humor is *too* stupid, and just plain annoying. Every one of the scenes without Matt and Trey suck, and you have to wonder how funny any of it would have been, if they had chosen not to participate at all.Thankfully, there are still a lot of funny parts in this dumb comedy. The drinking of the liposuctioned fat, the ridiculous music, the roadkill special, and 'Squeak' were all great. I think there was enough funny stuff in this movie to recommend it, but consider yourself warned: parts of it are still pretty stupid (as if you would expect anything else?).",6,0,1,18 May 2006
Aliens," One Of The Best Science-Fiction Movies Ever Made
","I've been a fan of 'Aliens' since I was pretty young, and unlike many other movies you end up liking less when you get older, 'Aliens' still stands as the same roller-coaster freakshow now as it was then. The monsters are huge, slimy, angry, and as awesome-looking as it gets. The casting is perfect, the weapons are just plain sweet (gotta love the flame-thrower!), and the film is never boring, even with its lengthy running time. The film isn't dated at all, and is still intense and realistic. It's tough to decide whether 'Aliens' or the original 'Alien' is superior, so I prefer to break it down this way: 'Alien' is the superior horror film, and 'Aliens' is the superior action film. There's just no comparing the two--they're in practically different genres. Plop in 'Aliens' and enjoy!",9,0,1,3 June 2006
Saw III," Let the blood spill!
","The original SAW was gruesome, but did occasionally leave things to the imagination. It had genuine tension, and a pretty intriguing mystery. SAW II was at least inventive and fun to watch. SAW III is easily the most gory, twisted, and nasty entry in the series, making it solid gold for the gore hounds out there. Unfortunately, the sense of mystery from the first two films is completely gone, you won't give a crap about the characters, and the pacing is clumsy. The film drags in many scenes, and just plain goes on for too long. If you're hard-core SAW/gore fan, you'll enjoy it, but there's only so much left the filmmakers can do with the premise. This is the kind of movie you're probably best off catching on sci-fi one night, rather than going to the theater.And seriously, how many ridiculously elaborate set-ups could a serial killer (even an inventive one) come up with? How big is the size of this warehouse--a city? How many billions of dollars were spent on these schemes? Where did the money come from, and how did a highly-wanted serial killer come up with it? Just a few questions to ponder..",6,0,1,3 November 2006
Batman Begins," Just couldn't get into it
","Very mild spoilers.Excited for Dark Knight, I bought this DVD because it was dirt-cheap. I've loved batman since I was little, especially the Tim Burton movies. Even with some Smirnoff in me, I simply couldn't enjoy this movie.Where to begin? Bruce Wayne's 'training' feels like a deleted scene from Kill Bill Vol. 2. The whole scene feels out-of-place, as if it belongs in a different movie. The part where his parents are shot is nowhere near as haunting or effective as in the original Tim Burton version. The plot is just ridiculous, and the villain isn't the least bit menacing or interesting.Christian Bale, who was fantastic in American Psycho, gives a very boring, stiff performance here. He provides almost no personality to Bruce Wayne at all. The movie is overlong and drags horribly in several scenes. The fight scenes (the few that are in there) are poorly directed and shockingly underwhelming.Sorry, but I can't recommend this one. And I really wanted to like it!",4,2,5,26 July 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," Quick, Fun, and Dumb Entertainment
","X3 is superior to the first two, in my opinion. It has more action than the first, and a better story than the second. I was never bored, and generally entertained. However, it really doesn't cover a heap of new ground, and I'm not sure how much else can be done with the X-men series. How many more different kinds of mutants can they cough up, and how many different stories? Maybe they should seriously consider making this the final X-men movie, as partly hinted by the title. 'Beast' looked ridiculous and laughable, and the 'mutants fighting each other' schtick is wearing thin. Ah, well. X3 is still quick, fun, and dumb entertainment. It'll keep you entertained while you watch it, but you'll likely forget it soon after you leave the theater. Maybe this is a better one to catch on DVD.",7,0,0,3 June 2006
Paranormal Activity," An excellent experience
","*Very mild spoilers* Let's get a few things out of the way. First and foremost, this is not really a movie designed for mainstream audiences--I predict it will disappoint many (or even most) of those going to see it. If you are unable to tolerate anything other than the conventional Jerry Bruckheimer type film with digital monsters, gore, etc. then save yourself the trouble and stay at home. If you're planning on seeing this, you probably have at least some idea of what this film is like (Blair Witch + haunted house). Needless to say, it is foolish to pay to see a movie you already know you will hate.Nonetheless, Paranormal Activity is a definite success as far as I'm concerned. The characters are totally believable, the build-up is excellent, and the pacing is perfect. Whether or not it will make you 'jump' in your seat depends on how well you take horror films. I almost never jump in my seat (this film included), but was still able to appreciate the suspense and sense of dread created by the 'night' scenes. When I was 12 years old or so, I was scared to death of being home alone in my house, especially at night. Every small creak in the floor boards meant that a possible stranger was there, in my mind. Obviously, I've long since grown out of that mindset, but PA helped bring it back a bit! The movie isn't so much 'scary' as it is just plain creepy. I'm glad they went with the 'demon' angle, because a ghost just wouldn't have been as eerie.If there's any downside to the movie, it's that it ends somewhat abruptly (perhaps just a hair more information would have made it more satisfying) and feels a little short.Aside from that, I greatly enjoyed the film and am not sure how much more I can write about it without giving stuff away. If it sounds like your cup of tea, give it a go!",8,0,1,1 November 2009
Avatar," Incredible visuals, surprisingly lame movie
","Yes, the visuals in Avatar are awesome. I saw it in 3-D and agree that it looks amazing.Unfortunately, it still isn't that great. In fact, it's the most over-hyped and overrated movie of the year. Anyone wanting more than special effects (intelligence? god forbid) is not going to have fun at this movie. I suspect that the more movies you've seen, the less Avatar will impress you. Of course, even the critics (inexplicably) think this is the greatest thing since canned spam, so perhaps I'm wrong.The biggest problem with Avatar is that its story is mind-numbingly generic, mediocre, unoriginal, predictable pap. It's Ferngully with better special effects. There weren't any twists or surprises here to engage or interest me in the slightest, which made for a dull and sometimes extremely boring film. The film's fans claim that 'every story has already been told' and therefore we shouldn't criticize it. But that's nonsense. If no new film ever had any suspense, people would quickly stop watching them.And then there's the running time. At 80 minutes, Avatar might have been tolerable. At 162, it's an endurance test. Especially with the lame characters and recycled story.Honestly, I don't think I could even sit through this bore a second time.",4,8,16,31 December 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Sorry, But The Da Vinci Code Is Average
","Time to face reality, folks. Regardless of your feelings on religion, the Da Vinci Code is just a long, slow, boring yawn-fest. The amount of talking and yapping and jabbering in this movie was borderline painful. The story is ridiculous when you look back on it. If you wanted someone to know they were a descendant of Christ, would you: A) Write a silly anagram for 'Da Vinci' in an obscure place for someone to figure out, then go to Da Vinci's painting and write 'so dark the con of man' in writing you can't see without an ulta-special light, and hope the person is with a professor who knows what it means (even while the professor is being ruthlessly hunted and endangered)? or B) Simply walk up to the person and say, 'Hey, you're a descendant of Christ. Pretty cool, eh?'Hmm...now, I don't know about you, but I would go with choice B. No rational person would ever, ever do anything like choice A. However, without planting a bunch of stupid codes everywhere, there would be no story and no movie, so we as an audience have to suffer through the oh-so-clever Hanks et all dissect all the ridiculous clues, so we can finally go home. Sound like fun? Well, it's kind of interesting I guess, and maybe I'm going too hard on it, but it just felt drawn-out and talky to me. See it if you care.",5,28,52,3 June 2006
War of the Worlds," I'm Rootin' For The Machines!
","Alright, I'm going to be honest here. This is a stupid, stupid film. It has plot holes up the yin-yang, and the ending is borderline retarded. But you know what? Watching these awesome, gigantic machines flatten cities and blow crap up was a friggin' blast! Yeah, that's right, I was rooting for the machines and aliens to win. I was hoping the ending would be that they wiped out the earth and the entire human race. Can you blame me? Of course you can't! The special effects are downright jaw-dropping, so I'm glad I saw this thing on the big screen. Tom Cruise plays the same arrogant jerk that he always plays, but this time he's running from machines! Machines with tentacles and cages where they keep their human slaves! Bwa ha ha ha! See it so you can also root against the foolish human mortals.",8,1,3,17 August 2005
The Ringer," Below average comedy
","The Ringer's laugh ratio, for me, was very similar to the one I experienced during Scary Movie 3. It's the kind of comedy that has an occasional loud chuckle, but between the occasional chuckles is a chore to watch. The story is so predictable that even the dumbest viewer will know it after watching the first fifteen minutes. Johnny Knoxville has the potential to make a great comedy some day, but this isn't it. Despite its subject matter, the film also plays it annoyingly safe, keeping it at a lame, watered-down PG-13 level throughout. It has some funny lines ('When the *bleep* did we get ice cream?'), but overall you should just stick to the South Park episode, which accomplished all of the same things and more, with bigger laughs, in only 25 minutes or so.",4,1,4,14 January 2006
Amélie," Worth Watching
","Amelie tells the story of an insecure girl who screws with people for fun. If you're okay with reading a good plenty of subtitles, and want something 'light' to watch, this one'll help you get through your evening. There is plenty of creative, clever and stylized directing with loads of quick cuts to keep you from getting bored. However, I'll concede that shortening the run time a tid bit might have made this Kool-Aid go down a little smoother. Amelie's character is an interesting and secretive one thankfully, which means we at least get to spend the running time with someone other than a cookie-cutter bore. The ending is especially strong, and the movie in general is realistic and entertaining.",8,0,1,17 August 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Decent, not a classic
","Before I start, let me say that I grew up with the Simpsons, and consider it the greatest animated series of all time. There was a time in my life when I absolutely would not ever dare to ever miss a new episode, and would then meet up with friends the next day to rehash the funniest parts. Part of what made the series so hilarious was Homers' utter irresponsibility, naïveté, and failure as a role model. (His response to a question about why he litters: 'It's easier. Duh.') Bart was also a total brat who would steal things, vandalize, and get in trouble at school. It was one of the few animated programs on at night instead of Saturday mornings (there are far more today, however). It was wildly popular. I can still remember way back to the ads they ran for the second half of the 'Who shot Mr. Burns?' episode (real people off the street were being interviewed on who they though the killer was).The Simpsons is a truly excellent series, but one that should have been ended around the years 2000-2001. The creators of Seinfeld knew to quit while they were ahead. The Simpsons, unfortunately, is not the show it used to be. Granted, it would be impossible for it to be the same after so many years and hundreds of episodes, but that's the reason why most television series eventually have to end. In the 'Poochie' episode, Lisa makes the same point about the Itchy and Scrachy show to a man wanting feedback: 'Um, excuse me sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy & Scratchy show, it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had.' This is a pretty good summary of the gradual decline in quality the Simpsons has been experiencing.I first saw a teaser ad for The Simpsons movie sometime in late 2005 or early 2006, I believe. I thought right off the bat that it was a bad idea. South Park and Beavis & Butt-Head had churned out movies relatively quickly, when the characters and material were still fresh, which was the wise thing to do. If there was ever a time for a Simpsons movie, it would have been in the mid-to-late 90's.Nonetheless, I knew I was going to be dragged to the movie by my friends one way or the other. I went hoping for the best, and was even excited that I would at least get to see The Simpsons on the big screen.So how did things turn out? Well, it at least kept me entertained and involved throughout, and it was better than I expected it to be. It's nowhere near the hilarity of the show at its peak, but far better than the most recent episodes. The first half hour is particularly decent, because it's close to an early Simpsons episode.While I of course enjoyed the mocking of the US government, I have to admit that I just didn't really care for the 'sealed in a dome' story and wish they had come up with a different plot. It seemed like they just wanted the most 'huge,' 'epic' plot ever, so they came up with the dome thing. But the stories on the show were rarely 'epic.' They were totally asinine and got laughs because of the ridiculous behavior of the characters (like when Homer and Bart make 'garbage angels' on the floor of their living room). You have to wonder what kind of opportunities they missed by introducing such a gargantuan idea for a plot. Oh well.The Simpsons movie is an easy and fun watch, but by the time the credits roll you realize how underwhelming it is. Maybe I'm being too hard on it, because my expectations were so high, but dangit's The Simpsons movie, man!! Ah well. It still has its moments. Who can possibly keep a straight face when Moe yells, 'The top of his head is showing! Claw at it!' Not me.All in all, while not a classic, The Simpsons movie will probably keep most fans entertained throughout.",6,1,3,11 August 2007
