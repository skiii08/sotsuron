Walk the Line," Lack of correct emphasis
","I thought the movie was entertaining and that the two stars did a fine job. My first question is why change history. The time sequence of their marriage is incorrect and the time sequence of the length of the brother's death is incorrect. Secondly, and I think more importantly, the impact of Johnny Cash's conversion or re-dedication to his faith is minimized to the point of being almost invisible. Is this because writers and directors are unfamiliar with the biography or they do not know enough about Christianity. Instead we get true love allows him to deal with his problems. I thought it would be better to give a more accurate picture of the man.",8,1,3,19 November 2005
