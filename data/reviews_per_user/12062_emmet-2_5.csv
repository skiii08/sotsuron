The Blair Witch Project," Terribly, terribly overrated
","Maybe I've read and heard too much about this film before I finally got around to see it, because I have to say it really disappointed me. OK, so the actors were good and the film has an interesting premise, but I can honestly say I wasn't scared ONCE during the whole movie. On the contrary, I became more and more bored as the film progressed. By the end, I was glad I never wasted ticket money to see this in the cinema, but waited until it came on cable.Here are a few of the reasons why I dislike the movie (WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS):<ul><li>All the 'scary' parts take place in complete darkness, where you are unable to see anything at all. It's confusing and irritating.</li></ul>
<ul><li>You never see what stalks the three main characters in the woods - you only hear what I guess is supposed to be scary sounds in the background (but it sounds more like someone raking the lawn...)</li></ul><ul><li>No music whatsoever (to create a more scary ambiance).</li></ul>This terribly overrated movie was a great disappointment to me. Maybe I don't scare easily, but this movie certainly could have made more of an effort to at least try to scare me...Rated on a dice (from 1 to 6) I give this movie a 2.",Null,1,2,3 November 2001
The Others," One wonderful movie
","I love scary movies. The only problem is, it's been a long time since I've seen a film that really had me scared. Last night, I saw 'The Others', and my waiting was finally over.The movie is set on the small channel island of Jersey right after the end of World War II. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a strongly religious woman who lives alone in a big mansion with her two young children. Her husband went fighting in the war and is missing, presumably dead. One night, something terrible happened in the mansion, and the servants all ran away. About one week later, three servants knocks on Graces door and offers their services. She takes them in and gives them their instructions. Because of a severe light allergy, the children must be kept out of the daylight. Every curtain in front of every window must be drawn, and every door in the house must be locked. To begin with, everything seems to progress as usual. But then, slowly, inexplicable things start to happen. Doors are left open. Whispering voices are heard. The piano starts playing itself. Graces daughter is 'seeing' people all over the house. At first, Grace refuses to believe her. But as the events continue, she is faced with the fact that there are indeed 'intruders' in the house - and she has to deal with them.This movie had my complete attention from the very beginning. There is an ominous, eerie atmosphere creeping out from the screen and into you as you are watching. The bleak mansion covered in perpetual fog; the pale children with their mysterious condition; the three servants who may or may not be who they really say they are; and - in the middle of it all - Grace, a truly complex character - deeply religious, a control freak, and at the same time a loving, caring mother. Nicole Kidman gives a tremendous performance as Grace, and really brings out all the different aspects of her personality - especially her mounting insanity and despair. Fionnuala Flanagan excels as Mrs. Mills, the trustworthy nanny who ever so slowly seems to be changing into a menacing threat. And the two young children are the surprise of the movie, playing their parts to perfection. They have some of the scariest scenes in the film - one when they are in bed trying to sleep, and the daughter suddenly starts talking to one of the 'intruders' only she can see (a boy named Victor), and one when they are hiding in a closet with danger looming outside. Other spooky scenes involve Grace in a storage room filled with objects covered in white sheets, Grace dressing up her daughter in a white communion dress, and Grace investigating sounds from a piano in a locked music room.But single scenes aside, it's the movie's whole, intense atmosphere that really gets your adrenaline going. This is not a movie for those who love blood, gore and special effects. It relies on its magnificent plot, being slow and deliberate, and building up tension throughout until you are on the edge of your seat, biting your nails and holding your breath in anticipation. The cinematography, the camera angles, the subdued, menacing score - it all blends together into one wonderful movie. The only objection I have is the middle part of the movie, where the plot centers around Grace's lost husband and seem to lose focus for a while. But then it picks up the pace again, and the ending is both so terrifying and so wonderfully ingenious that you are left completely astounded. All the pieces fit together, all the loose ends are tied up and all your questions are answered - but in a way I certainly didn't see coming. 'The Others' is a successful mix of several genres - the traditional ghost story, a thriller, a family drama - all in one. I'll rate it 6 out of 6 on my dice, and give it my highest recommendations.",Null,0,1,28 March 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Very faithful adaption of a great book
","It took me a while to warm up to the whole Harry Potter-hysteria, and so far I've only read the first book. But if the rest of the series is anywhere near as good as 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' (yes, I've read the British version), I can't wait to get my hands on it.As for the film, it's a very faithful adaption of the novel. Director Columbus has not strayed far from J.K. Rowling's plotlines, which works very well for me. I have to agree, though, with some of the other reviewers, that some of the 'magic feeling' of the book is gone from the film. That said, it's still a great movie. The actors do a very fine job indeed, particularly the three young protagonists (with Rupert Grint/Ron as my personal favourite). Daniel Radcliffe does well as Harry, particularly considering that in the book, we get to know very much about him through his thoughts and feelings, which are not so easily conveyed on the big screen. The only funny thing about Radcliffe is the way his voice changes throughout the film (down - up - down again). But I guess that is the danger of working with pre-pubescent boys anyway... The 'adult' cast is - as expected - outstanding, and very well suited for their characters (you just have to love Rickman as Snape...). The special effects are well done (and not overdone). The Quidditch game was especially spectacular, as well as the moving stairs and Fluffy the dog.All in all, this is a wonderful movie for children of all ages. I give it a very strong 5 (out of 6) on my dice, and recommend it to everyone!",Null,0,0,4 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An excellent adventure and great fun!
","As an avid Harry Potter-fan, my expectations for this movie were high even though 'Chamber of Secrets' is my least favourite of the four published books. But CoS the movie works very, very well indeed  a nice step up in quality from 'Philosopher's Stone'. Whereas the first movie  for all its charm and freshness  had to cover so many different aspects of Harry Potter's life and his magical world that it sometimes gave the impression of being assembled by a row of different scenes which didn't always fit well together, the structure and overall aim has been greatly improved in CoS. Since this is a sequel, we can disperse with all the explanations and introductions to the magical world and go straight to the plot (which, in fact, strongly resembles the plot of the first book/movie: something evil is going on at Hogwarts, and it is up to our three heroes to figure out what it is and how to stop it). But the story works better in CoS, mainly because the film constantly moves forward  all the scenes serve a purpose, and they are sowed perfectly together. Sure, there are some omissions, but nothing significant in the overall plot is missing. Add to that some greatly enhanced special effects (mostly noticed in the Quidditch match) and an improved group of child actors, and the result can only be a success.It falls to the three young protagonists  Harry, Ron and (partly) Hermione (she is absent from much of the last quarter of the film)  to carry most of the movie, since they definitely get the most screen time. They do well in my opinion  my personal favourite is still Ron (Rupert Grint), who shows superb comical timing and has an overflow of facial expressions to match any given situation. Daniel Radcliffe is more convincing as Harry this time around and gives a good performance, while Emma Watson has surprisingly little to do as bossy Hermione takes a back seat to the boys in this movie (but she still sparkles at times). All three seem to have grown more into their roles since the first movie (as well as maturing physically), and it will be interesting to see if they choose to stay on for all seven movies. Tom Felton also gets several chances to show he can be a real menace as Harry's arch-enemy Draco. The adult cast is flawless as expected, with newcomer Kenneth Branagh as the wonderfully self-centred Gilderoy Lockhart stealing most of the scenes he participates in (interestingly enough, Branagh seems to be down-playing Lockhart a bit, which gives him more credibility and actually seems quite appropriate here). Jason Isaacs as the evil, venom-dripping Lucius Malfoy is another noticeable addition. A haggard Richard Harris portrays headmaster Dumbledore with quiet dignity in what was to be his last movie, and Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are solid as Professors McGonagall and Snape (even though they get far too little screen time). The special effects in the movie also deserve praise. Having more than a mild case of arachnophobia, I strongly feared the spider scenes in the Forbidden Forest (more so than Harry's final encounter with a giant snake), and the computer generated eight-leggers completely gave me the shivers with their credibility. Equally impressive (if somewhat annoying) is the 100% animated house elf, Dobby. Other treats in the special effects department include the journey to Hogwarts aboard a flying Ford Anglia, the Mandrake plants, the tongue-in-cheek Quidditch match and the huge basilisk in the chamber. All of these  as well as the scenes involving more 'everyday' magic like staircases changing directions, people in paintings moving around and pots and pans cleaning themselves  are excellently crafted and executed, and they blend in with the 'real' actors and the 'real' scenery amazingly well, adding an extra dimension to the movie.So, with a strong plot, convincing actors, a strong musical score by John Williams (very reminiscent of the first HP-movie, but it still works well), excellent special effects and a darker, more 'adult' cinematography and scenery, 'Chamber of Secrets' is a great movie which should entertain almost everyone (but avoid bringing very young children to see this movie, as it is definitely scarier than the first). Almost three hours in front of the silver screen fly by, and I left the cinema wanting more (or at least to see this movie again). I'll rate 'Chamber of Secrets' a strong 5 out of 6 on my dice, and recommend it warmly. Enjoy!",Null,0,0,18 December 2002
Final Destination," Nice and creepy - most of the time
","First of all, I agree with some of the other comments here that describes this film as 'disturbing'. Why? Probably because what happens to the characters in the film could just as well happen to you or me. Innocent, everyday items suddenly become fatal instruments of death. I also liked the idea of fate and/or 'death' being the killer, not some loony mask-covered psychopath. There was a nice creepy atmosphere to most of the film which I really enjoyed. And I walked out of the cinema with an eerie feeling, always looking over my shoulder and checking MANY times before I crossed the road. In that respect, the movie was brilliant. There were a couple of flaws, however, which somewhat muddled up the general impression. First of all, the 'Billy' character. Now why do scary films nowadays have to have this clichèd 'funny' types in them, always making silly comments at the wrong moments? Take some of the 'golden oldies' of horror - 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Omen', 'The Exorcist' - they became a success because they kept the scary mood going throughout the film, not mixing it up with stupid attempts at humor. It just ruins the whole atmosphere of the film. Secondly, I felt the ending was a bit stretched, and it does open up nicely for a sequel...But, all in all, I enjoyed this film; I found the acting to be generally believeable (which is not always true of teen horror movies), and I was repeatedly scared and surprised by some of the sudden happenings in the movie. Oh - and the airplane sequence at the beginning is...upsetting, to say the least. Thank God I don't have any immediate holiday plans this summer...Judging on a dice, this film gets a strong 4 (out of 6).",Null,0,0,29 June 2000
