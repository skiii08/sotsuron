Angels & Demons," Sorely Disappointing... Only good thing is Tom Hanks' hair.
","Ever since I heard they were making this movie at the beginning of The DaVinci Code I was extremely excited for it. So excited in fact that when the DVD was released in Europe a full 2 1/2 months earlier than it is to be in the US I went through the trouble of having it shipped overseas. From the VERY BEGINNING I was disappointed! Langdon was not contacted in person by the Vatican, he was contacted over the phone by CERN director, who wasn't even in the movie at all which is hilarious because he's the one that is supposed to record the confession of the Chamberlengo. Before that, Vittoria Vetra wasn't even at CERN when her adopted father, Dr. Vetra, was murdered (in his study, not in the lab) and he eye used to get into the dark matter lab. The movie didn't even mention that Dr. Vetra WAS Vittoria's father of any kind. Continuing further out, Vittoria is supposed to be kidnapped by the Assassin when they both go in to rescue the Cardnial from the fire.There are many MANY other problems between book and movie, and I admit that sometimes there are differences, but whoever wrote the story for the movie must have read the book upside down! I noticed that the culprit may have been trying to hide the original messages that come from the book. The idea of the war between science and religion, they tried to dumb it down, maybe to not offend anyone, maybe because the writers were too religious to be effective and unbiased. I am aggravated I went through so much work to get this movie early and in my honest opinion, Sony Pictures needs to try again with this. I don't care if the movie is 3 hours instead of 2 1/2, GET THE STORY RIGHT! They did so well with The DaVinci Code, what happened here? My recommendation? Read the book again, leave the movie alone.",1,4,6,21 September 2009
