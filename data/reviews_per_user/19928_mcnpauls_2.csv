Alien 3," An extremely intriguing and very brave blockbuster
","This is the most intelligent and interesting film in the series. The first two are very good and quite good respectively, but I do feel they are over-rated. This film, in contrast, deserves a much better reputation than it has gained. It is atmospheric, dark, bold, different and intelligent. I agree, though, that it does suffer from the obvious removal of 'less commercial' , ie, more intelligent scenes.I'd really love to know what Vincent Ward would have produced if he had been allowed to direct his even bolder and more complex vision for 'Alien'.",9,2,4,15 June 2001
Total Recall," Not bad, but Michael Ironside is the film's real star
","Yet again, the great Canadian cult actor steals a major film. Why isn't this man recognised as one of the great sinister screen presences? He is definitely comparable to cinema legends like Jack Palance when it comes to emanating menace and he is a fine actor to boot. Ronny Cox, as his evil boss, also gives a fine, and subtle, performance. Sharon Stone has never been this good before or since.",9,0,1,15 June 2001
