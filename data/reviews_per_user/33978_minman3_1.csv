Men in Black 3," A Nice Finish with Feeling
",It is a nice story line that ties many things together. It started out a little slow showing us were everyone is and there is a death in MIB. Things pick up after the funeral and keep moving until the end. As a teenager in NY in 1969 it was nice to see footage of the now demolished Shea Statium and the sets of the Apollo 11 launch. There are some surprises that you need to see in the movie that I will not spoil. This is a must see and from my on feelings is this is the end of this franchise. You will see the old and newest 'flashy thingy'. It has some of the old standards with funny aliens with their own personnel quirks. Sit back and enjoy.,9,1,6,25 May 2012
