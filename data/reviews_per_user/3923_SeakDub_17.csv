10 Cloverfield Lane," A Good Suspense That Falls Flat.
","If you are wondering what the movie 10 Cloverfield Lane is, well lets say it is a decent suspense film in the same universe as the Cloverfield movie. And I think that was a brilliant idea especially how the movie plays out and makes you wonder what in John Goodman's mind is going on. I was loving it. Gives you that intense creep feel throughout the movie, just waiting to see how this is all going to end. And then the epilogue comes and you feel a stab in your stomach, and realize they just took what could have been an epic ending and turned it into Hollywood's money gimmick. So from here, if you haven't seen the movie and what to know why I think it is a great and awful film continue on. Otherwise don't read on, I will go into much detail on the ending. So again, the beginning, middle, and just up to the end was a fun movie to watch. It makes you guess and wonder what is going to happen. It gives you goosebumps wondering how are they going to tie this movie in with Cloverfield. I think that idea alone makes this movie that much more intense. To have two separate movies that gives you different feels, beautiful! You imagine you know what is going on in the outside world(if you seen Cloverfield), so we go along in this movie inside a safe shelter. John Goodman's character is wonderful to me, winning an award for best villain! You feel for him, then scared, then terrified of this guy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job and wouldn't have asked for anyone else. While this movie mainly takes place in a shelter, it does a great job on just the story, character growth, and the suspense waiting for the climatic moment. The music was on par. I think they did a very great job on it. I was actually loving the buildup/intense sounds, amazing job there! Then finally, the moment is here. I'm going through my head what is to come when we see the outside world. And bam! Hollywood takes over, they did their thing and just ruined everything about this movie to me. I can't say this is all Hollywood's fault, it could've be who wrote it, J.J. Abrams for all I know. The reason I'm saying Hollywood and a money gimmick is the fact you had a movie that wasn't anything like Cloverfield, but in the same universe waiting to see how it ties in. To just get alien ships flying in, killing humans on sight. Random cheesy fight scene. A lady who was terrified of John Goodman's character to somehow take on an alien ship with a molotov cocktail and win? Survives, and goes to fight in a town where they are being attacked by aliens trying to wipe us out. All that enraged me. How did Cloverfield, which centered around a giant alien, yes I know it fell from space I guess, that spawned creepy little aliens to this movie having alien ships, giant alien ships trying to take us over. How many alien movies can I name that have that plot? War of the Worlds, Independence Day, Skyline(ugh), Mars Attack!, Signs, Battle Los Angeles. Off the top of my head. What I'm trying to say is, why go that route? Why couldn't we have got a better ending, something that tied it into Cloverfield? All those movies I listed could have been in the same universe. Why call this one a Cloverfield? Why not 10 Independence Day Lane? A dark ending that fits in with the dark element of the movie, not an action hero ending. Have her come out of the shelter and see the monster from Cloverfield fighting Godzilla would have been way better. But from what I hear, the script is/was meant for another film after this. Money gimmick is how I see it. They could have ended this movie which showed us actual more of the monster or story. But we get alien ships. Only reason I gave it a 6/10 was because the rest of the movie held up. Not the ending, if that is your type of movie I say go for it. Otherwise, pass!!",6,0,0,7 February 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Thrilling Space Ride!
","A needed Star Wars movie!Star Wars 7 was a let down for me. It didn't do justice after all the years fans waited for another Star Wars movie. At least to me. But Rogue One was the justice. An action packed movie that was very entertaining. It was a side story that brought the life of the Star Wars universe back I was spectacle about seeing Rogue One. After being disappointed by how Star Wars 7 went. I almost thought I'd wait around and not see the movie in theaters. But I decided against it and went to a late showing because it's Star Wars and just had to see it on the big screen. And by goodness sake I was glad I did. The movie starts right away introducing the new faces, Rogue One. If you don't know what this Star Wars is about, during Star Wars 4 it was said a team of rebels stole the plans of the Death Star. This is that team and the story that goes along is way better than expected.10/10 for the beautiful, gorgeous visual effects they pulled off!!The way they tie Rogue One within the Star Wars universe was brilliant. It felt like I was right back into the Star Wars world. And the action and fight scenes were intense. The visual effects out did themselves in here. It was beautiful. It looked so good to the eye. You couldn't have asked for a better side story to the Star Wars franchise. From the new faces you see and old faces, the acting is supreme. Felicity Jones did an amazing job with Diego Luna. Alongside with the other cast members, they all did a wonderful job to get you to feel their character.I usually have some elements that I bring to the table that they could have done differently or something I didn't like. But as I look back at the movie, it just felt right. It connected well with the Star Wars universe. And I can't say where they might have messed up on. With Star Wars 7 having its own issues. And with the success of this film. I have to only say I am excited that hopefully Star Wars 8 will redeem itself and bring on the story that fans want. With that said I would recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan and anyone who just wants to see some action pack thrill. You won't be bored nor waiting for the action to build up. The special effects is 10/10(I cannot stop thinking about how amazing the CGI was here), a must see. And you couldn't go wrong with the epic Star Wars music that always hits home. Again, you couldn't have asked for a better Star Wars story to add to the Star Wars universe.",9,1,8,21 December 2016
Lilo & Stitch," You'll want a Stitch for yourself!
","It's a Disney film. You love or hate or sometimes just go eh. But Lilo and Stitch for me as a kid made me want a pet and Stitch himself. As an older adult now I still can sit and watch this movie and still love every part about the movie. And you can't go wrong with Elvis songs either. I can't see anyone hating on Stitch. You feel for Lilo as well, and her sister. I am thankful for Disney to give me this movie. I am a fanatic about Stitch and just love the short temper alien he is. Kids will love him, be warned tho! They'll want to try and go adopt a pet! Probably not but still, I wanted to at the young age. Throughout the Disney movies you will find one that speaks to you, and being tough with Lion King I have to say Stitch is my choice. If you haven't seen Lilo & Stitch, by goodness see it! Now also being that I love Stitch and watching the sequels. If you know anything about Disney and their sequels(Mulan 2, Little Mermaid 2, etc) you'll know it doesn't end well. The sequels for Stitch are bad. Not the best, watchable but eh. Kids will love them too but teens and adults will surely pass over those. But the original Lilo and Stitch, 10/10. Great movie, truly. Might not love it like I do, but you will enjoy the movie I'm sure of it. Thanks for reading! Now go enjoy Lilo and Stitch's adventure!",10,0,0,14 November 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic!... It Is In The Title.
","So the overall movie was, well, FANTASTIC! At least for fans of the Harry Potter series. It seems like it will tie in nicely and go into detail about the first Wizard War or such. So the upcoming parts I can't wait to see. For fans who haven't been into Harry Potter but may want to see this, it is still a wonderful ride. I love fantasy creatures and beasts. And this shows off some impressive ones. I give it a 9/10 for the beauty and adventure. But it felt like it had a few slow parts that either should have sped up or wasn't necessary, I'll go more into detail about that further down.The GOOD! The movie in the end was very FANTASTIC! Loved even the fact it sets around the time 1926 in New York. And Eddie Redmayne did a very talented job at playing the role of Newt Scamander. Most of the other actors were new faces to me. But they themselves did a wonderful job/part of the Wizarding World. The other two actors I did know were Colin Farrell and Dan Fogler. I very much enjoy Farrell and was excited to know he was in the movie as well. And Fogler, was happy to make me laugh once again. Since the last movie I saw him in was Balls of Fury(2007) so it has been awhile. Then comes the fantastic beasts! I was very happy to see that they did show many different creatures and not just a couple. Since the movie was in a way to show beasts it would have been a big downer to not see much variety of them. But you get it, and that was a big plus in my book. Sort of wish I had a few myself, and if you saw the movie you may know what beast you really want.To continue with the good of the movie. It had me laughing and Dan Fogler's character should make you laugh. One thing I did enjoy it gave us spells again. It didn't just stopped at the beasts but enhanced or reminded us the many different spells they use. The CGI at times was, to me, looked fake. Yes, CGI is fake but it should match in at least. My eyes at times were able to tell something wasn't right, you saw Newt standing next to a computerized beast when they were trying to make it look real as possible. But going over those parts, the CGI that was good, was amazing! The effects turned out cool. I get nit picking with CGI movies but this played it off nicely. I miss old animatronic animals or creatures. But in the end the effects came down to surprise me for the movie.Now with the bad. I believe it was two parts of the movie, maybe three, that were really slow and lot of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad just that it wasn't necessary. In a way it ended up being more cheesy than what they were after. There was also another part of the movie which involved a creature. One of the comical scenes to make people laugh. But I felt so awkward and weird watching it, that I didn't laugh during this scene and was again waiting for the scene to end. The scene did make audience members laugh, I just wasn't feeling it. A five part movie, which ain't bad at all, but you tend to get the scenes that can go on a bit to do movie fillers. Make the movie longer, if played out right it goes unnoticed because you are wanting more. But besides those couple of scenes I can't find much else, of course some of the acting was cheesy. And the extras(people standing around in the back) did feel oddly placed. Didn't need. The CGI did seem off to me, or at least the creatures and human interactions. At times it was like watching a real animal. Then other times you could tell it was computerized and didn't match well or look odd/out of place. But it wasn't all the time.J.K. Rowling I think did a supreme job writing the Harry Potter books. The way she manage to write a story, characters, twists, and other things. What always made me happy was you, yes YOU, could go on, add stories, fan theories, and depth that could have meaning to her story. Sort of like Star Wars. There is so much to still learn from her story. That is what I find thrilling. So with this story we get to learn much more. And hopefully with J.K. writing it, we get much more suspense and twists and excitement. Even more characters that is to come! So with David Yates directing and Rowling writing, I think we will have a wonderful four more movies to come.Kids who grew up waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out, along with the movies. We are grown up now, possibly having a family, friends who enjoyed it alongside with us. The new generation will be watching it with us. And I say that right there is probably the best part about this series. We get to cherish the memories again with people who take this movie to heart. So I say this movie is a must see. Kids will love it, younglings may get spook from the fights or creatures but I highly doubt it. And teens to adults will love another adventure through the Wizarding World.I do have to mention one more thing. I am unsure about other viewers, but when I saw this movie, it felt like it related to Star Wars. Which had me laugh to think that. I won't say why I thought so. But there were many times I had scenes pop into my head of a Star Wars movie.",9,12,22,20 November 2016
Spirited Away," A Beautiful Adventure that is Visually Stunning.
","Right after watching the movie I knew I had to write a review about this movie. I was so stunned to see just how beautiful Spirited Away was, especially an anime film from 2001. A true 10 out of 10 film. A MUST SEE!!Graphics/Animation- Was just so amazing. Hayao Miyazaki, really outdid himself with this film. In fact all of his films. His movies are a must see. It is beyond beautiful, the way the characters move, run, talk, eat... a masterpiece. Almost every little detail on this movie was carefully crafted. You will be awed.The Adventure- Chihiro's(main character) adventure throughout the movie was indeed mind blowing and fun to watch. The characters and spirits were very unique. I seen many anime that had bizarre story lines or characters but nothing like this. You are drawn to each character in a way. Alongside the characters, the adventure you watch is stuff I love to watch. Beautiful fantasy world. Makes you wish you kept seeing more of this world that she goes exploring through. Music- So with the gorgeous animation and lovable characters, the music is just perfect. It fits so well into the movie that you won't even need to hear them talk but just listen to the music and watch the adventure and it will still be a perfect movie. It makes the scenes either even more stunning or intense. Great Laughs and Feels- Not only is it a heartwarming movie that gives you feels. But it makes you laugh. Chihiro is not only cute but you feel for her and the characters. I laughed pretty good at some parts that surprised me. You know you pulled it off when you have a movie you can laugh and at the same time feel all sort of emotions really. And the food shown was so good looking I really wanted to go out and get some grub.All in all I couldn't think of anything bad to say about the movie. The only thing that had me wonder was the ending, don't get me wrong. A well done ending, but I had a few questions. But I look over it with how everything else was. So with that I couldn't come up with a reason why you shouldn't take the time to watch this or any other Hayao Miyazaki's movies. I know for sure I am gonna be watching the rest of his films.",10,0,1,22 October 2016
No Country for Old Men," Beautiful but Overrated.
","From mixed reviews this movie either goes 1 star or 10 stars on different views from reviewers. It lands in the middle for me with a 6 because it wasn't anything special. The movie is well paced, beautiful landscape even if it is desert. And overall an actually pretty violent movie. I have seen many Coen movies but never payed any mind to who they were until this movie. This 'No Country For Old Men' was quite a build up movie. Having a lone hunter finding a drug exchange gone wrong and finding some hefty cash. Hits the jackpot he runs home and from there has a change of heart and goes back to give a dying man some water. From there, that was his mistake and is then hunted by the drug dealers wanting their money back. But worse, a psychotic assassin comes into play killing anyone who basically talks to him. The assassin of course is after the money, leaving the lone hunter to jump from place to place to make sure he isn't next on the psychotic assassin's hit list. Then comes into play the sheriff of the town who seems to give more stories and philosophies than really do anything else. So sets into motion the rest of the movie of cat and mouse from the lone hunter being chased by the assassin and drug dealers while the sheriff is picking up pieces. An intense battle of who comes out on top of catching the cash. Ends up beautifully made and thrilling. But stops at the ending were it goes from great to disappoint. Spoilers Ahead!I believe the Coen brothers did a wonderful job on the movie, I actually thank them from what I hear is that they kept much of the book into the film. But the ending comes as a very big disappointment to me seeing how it ends without any answers. One of the make it your own ending feels. The assassin who seems to feel no pain randomly gets in a car crash and just walks away. The lone hunter who we think is going to have an epic gun battle with the psychotic killer is seen one scene fine, next scene dead and found by the sheriff. From the drug dealers so we believe they snatched the money and bail out. From the books perspective the assassin gets the money and returns it to the original owner. In the movie we don't even know if he gets the money and we guess the drug dealers do. Another question leads us to think why and how did he know about the money. Book may answer it, but for the film he just kind of shows up. So we can't say who he works for, if by himself, or really anything about the assassin expect that he likes to kill and wants the money. Finally the sheriff tells a dream of his father and how he is just too old for the things going on and retires. Which is a dull way of ending a book/movie. I can't blame the Coen brothers but I was so twisted and turn by the end of this movie that I started to hate on it. I don't care if the overall villain escapes or wins but this was just a confusing ending. And by confusing I mean why they decided to end it the way they did. You can see where they were going with it but it fails to leave you satisfied. For the acting, I say it was boring. I couldn't get into any character. Love Tommy Lee Jones but the storytelling sheriff he plays puts people to sleep. Josh Brolin did a good job on his part of acting, it was his character I hated. From the random choices he makes and seemly being a smart guy did really weird choices. A good guy who ended up paying for the choices he made. I just didn't care for it. And finally the psychotic killer assassin played by Javier Bardem. Now that was a masterpiece character and acting. He played such a creepy guy that I swear I was getting the willies every time he came on screen. The role was perfect for him. A standalone perfect 10 for this guy, Javier deserves the win for the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. I also do have to mention Woody Harrelson's character and say that was the worse cameo? Pointless to me, maybe it made more sense in the book but it was such a letdown to have him appear only to boringly talk.Otherwise besides the ending, the movie itself is a very intense build up that seems like it would be a slow movie which actually gets you hooked. I was enjoying it, scenery, action, and all. I don't even remember the music/soundtrack for the film. I can see why people either like it or hate it. I'm in the middle ground and say if it wasn't for such a rushed filling ending I would have agreed to saying this movie is a must see. But with the violence, character growth, and lousy ending. I have to say skipped the movie and enjoy another movie.",6,1,4,4 March 2017
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A Gold Mine.
","Stumbling onto this movie is like stumbling into a gold mine. Pure gold is how I would put it. This movie was in all ways what I love. A perfect dark comedy in every element. If you have not seen this movie, this is a highly recommended movie. It starts off as any typical horror movie, you get the college kids, the creepy rednecks, and being in the woods with a cabin. You can see where this is going, but it isn't what you think. The couple of rednecks (played beautifully by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) who are just wanting to get away on vacation in their cabin in the woods. But comes along the college kids looking to party out in the woods and believes they are not who they seem. That is when the chaos ensues, believing the rednecks to be in-bred hillbilly killers. And all they wanted was to enjoy the peace and quiet. Comedy and gore makes this movie a 10 out of 10 for me. From the beginning to end I was laughing. Never a dull moment for me. I have re-watched this film numerous times and still find it as funny as the first time. If you are not into gore and blood you will not much enjoy the film much, but I do know people who are against death/gore/violence and have stated that this film was very clever and hilarious. Somehow the comedy from the morbid humor makes it a classic. This movie should be listed on the top #250 films on IMDb.",10,1,1,3 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Jar Jar Ranks Higher Compared To This
","It was two years since The Force Awakens. Time to write a decent enough story to give to Star Wars fans. But what everyone got was a flop and garbage of all the Star Wars movies. Besides having a terrible story, the side story had no point and was way too long. Just couldn't believe the movie focused mainly on a slow speed chase of starships. Then we get a side story of Finn played by John Boyega which feels like they had no idea how to include him in the movie. Not only is the side story way too long but everything about it was just awful. Understandably the good guys might not always succeed in their mission, but with how long this part went on to just become pointless made the movie much longer than it should have. As for character decisions and characters themselves it made no sense on why certain actions were chosen. Captain Phasma again did nothing to prove why she is indeed a captain. The dialogue was just as bad especially when a star ship is falling a part and you have Kelly Marie Tran's character Rose roll up in some vehicle to yell at Finn(keep in mind that fires, ship is falling a part) to yell 'Need a lift' made me wonder who wrote this.With a different route and direction this movie would have been what fans deserved. Sadly we are stuck with the awfulness that is to continue in the 9th installment. It is just sad to see Disney giving the typical cliches, jokes and humor, and their way to make new characters/animals to sell. Prequels so far are more entertaining. But not all was bad. They did pull off some amazing action scenes that were jaw dropping and surprising. Of course the CGI and scenes were also grand. It is just a shame with everything else that came with it. Of course most fans of the Star Wars will watch this. I do not recommend it but a one time is all you need. If not into Star Wars then don't even bother with this movie. 5/10 is being too fair on this movie. But being impressed on some scenes it should really be rated a 1. The lowest of low for a SW movie. So much more can be sad on why it is an awful movie.",5,1,2,27 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Masterpiece.
","I'll start off by saying, an awesome soundtrack to one of the best superhero movies I have seen.As a kid, Ironman was my favorite superhero. So when that movie came out I had to see it. And I believe that movie was also a true work of art. But as I started to watch more Marvel movies along the way, I only noticed failures(Daredevil, X-men Origins Wolverine, Spider-Man 2 and 3, and don't get me started on Iron-man 2, etc). So going into theaters to see Guardians of the Galaxy, I won't lie, no idea who or what the comic/movie was about.Well by the end of the movie I was loving it. Knowing Marvel, they try to give it to you all from action to romance. Well I think director James Gunn did a supreme job on this film. Plenty of action to the funny remarks from a raccoon. The casting was well done, Christ Pratt pulled off an awesome Starlord, just as Robert Downey Jr. pulled off an awesome Ironman. You know its true. So going on, Marvel gave all decent comic flicks(Thor 2, Avengers 1 and 2, Captain America, Punisher, etc) that I can handle and enjoy. But Guardians? As I said in the summary, I believe its a masterpiece that I can't wait for the sequel. Yes, a sequel I'm excited for. Just hope they don't overdo it now. After seeing this movie, I'm sure you will want to check into the comics about the Guardians. I sure did.Soundtrack!! The music in the movie, man it fit so well. Wanted to dance along. I am not afraid to admit it, got the song Hooked on a Feeling as my ring-tone. If you're a fan of music, you won't be disappointed.I believe it deserves a 10/10 because of just how it all works together. I'm not a big movie critic, but I do notice things. And from what I saw, not a moment in this movie will you lose interest. All in all, you get it all within this movie. So for me reviewing this, I can surely say, this is by far the best superhero movie. Along side Ironman of course. A movie I did not regret seeing in theaters. Long live STARLORD!!!P.S. Also Yondu.",10,1,4,29 May 2015
Evil Dead," Fan of The Evil Dead? Not bad for a remake!!!
","To viewers of not knowing or seeing the original The Evil Dead. With Evil Dead, being a remake I heard of lot of people saying the movie wasn't scary or a horror. The genre is horror, but mostly people just were disgusted by the disturbing scenes. I had a lot of friends hating on it, some got scared, some loved it, and others just thought, WOW! That was a lot of blood. Which I can say it was all true. It was more of an intense, bloody intense movie! You either will like or hate it, the story is bout the same of the original with a few added details that weren't bad. For people who want to be scared, it may not be a horror for a scare. But for someone wanting to watch some gore-fest, perfect fit!!!To all the Evil Dead fans who haven't seen it!!(If you're an Evil Dead fan, why haven't you seen it?)I loved this as a remake, most will say the original is better, and I agree, The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 is by far more hilarious and brilliant. But from the music, being epic, and the trivia and elements from the original they did an amazing job putting it together! I saw this movie with Evil Dead fans and we all laughed, and cheered at the end! A remake made pretty damn good. I just loved how they added bits and pieces of the original. Especially the famous boomstick and chainsaw. Groovy.So in the end, 10/10. Why? Because I'm an Evil Dead fan, and it was an amazing remake! You'll never want to vacation to a cabin in the woods after seeing this movie. But for me? I loved the movie, and am very glad that it didn't end up being a truly awful remake. Thank you Fede Alvarez(who I had the pleasure of meeting, great guy)! So go check it out! And if you didn't see the originals, why not have a Evil Dead marathon!!! That way they all fit in and make the night a wonderful night of laughs!",10,0,5,17 November 2014
Logan," Logan VS Deadpool, LOGAN DOMINATES!
","Logan was the Wolverine we needed. A long wait for an end of an era finale that hit all emotions. Deadpool was comical and funny and blew the box office in a slow February. Logan however was a very intense emotionally western feel that pummeled Deadpool in the end. Between the two, Logan came out victorious. This movie will take you on a journey of high and low mixture of feelings. Logan is such an action pack, furious Wolverine that's sailor mouth, who anyone getting in his way will be six feet under. Logan is our hero who just wants to enjoy the remaining years of his life in peace with his friend Professor X who knows of a young mutant. A deadly young wolverine. Which brings trouble to Logan who has to decide to help the young mutant or turn his head. But what starts with meeting with someone who has a secret only leads into bloodshed and leaving Logan to do everything in his adamant power to shred his way to stopping the pursuers that are after the young child. James Mangold made sure to tell the story and storytelling of this film in such a beautiful way. From directing it and being the writer, he puts out such a strong story that focuses on Logan. Surpassing most superhero movies and action movies. This is unlike any film you have seen and cannot pass up Logan. A must see!If rated PG-13, Logan, would still be a top notch movie. With a R- rating it gives more emotions the characters are going through, the violence they are enduring in which they want out. Because of the R- rating it does a lot more to the story, showing us the real Wolverine that people needed to see. To know what these characters were fighting for. Not a movie for children. Children should grow up watching the X-Men movies and animated shows. Then into the Wolverine movies. And finally when old enough to appreciate such an awesome character Logan is, then see this movie!Old man Logan, The Wolverine, Hugh Jackman. The man who was perfection for the role, the man who we watched through 17 years playing one of the best comics heroes nailed his performance every time. But this time it had such more meaning and respect for him. To watch him portray old man Logan was quite depressing to see that we are at the end of the series and seeing the last time we will see Hugh Jackman play him. And by goodness grace went out with a bang on such an amazing film. Don't forget now of Sir Patrick Stewart who also was the perfect role for Professor X, Charles Xavier. Another depressing emotion that is the last performance by a man who made the character come alive. James McAvoy did a great job but Patrick Stewart just fit the character so much better. And to see his portrayal of old Professor X is another reason why this movie did such a wonderful job on bringing the story and elements to life. Let's not leave out the young actress Dafne Keen who was just supreme in this movie. Talented young actress who I hope see to become an even greater actress later on. She stole the film from everyone. Believe it when I say the look she gives should tell that you do not want to make this child angry. Almost everything about this movie makes you wish it could keep going. Finishing Logan will bring a tear to your eye one way or another. A powerful movie that will or should make you appreciate the people and love ones you have around you now before it is too late. Not a flaw went through my head. A perfect 10 out of 10. Regardless in theaters or one point at home, check out this movie! And appreciate one final time Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's beautiful performance that we all know we will miss. Thank you two and everyone else for the making of this film.",10,3,8,15 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Another Awesome Ride With the Guardians!
","As good as Vol. 1? I believe so. This movie came out just as wonderful as the first. A perfect 10/10 again. From all the Marvel films, Guardians of the Galaxy takes the win and favorite. If you have not yet seen either of the two, I strongly recommend them.Following our favorite bad mouthing heroes, Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and probably everyone's favorite baby Groot. This time though we get to learn some back story's and most importantly who Starlord's father really is. An emotional but funny space journey. Hats off to James Gunn again pulling off another incredible film. From start to finish we get to learn more about these heroes which was left out of the first volume. And with doing so, great jokes and some intense action. One of the reasons I love Guardians so much is the music/soundtrack. Beautiful music that of course comes from Starlord which gives it a much more deep element than just random thrown in music. It is who he is. And glad of the song choices they picked this time round. You almost want to jump up and start dancing. In the first volume, Starlord stuck out and believe you loved him the most. Whereas this one I praise James Gunn on Drax, Dave Bautista who plays him. This character will have you on the edge of your seat laughing. Probably the best jokes come from him. But what is also beautiful is just how kids actually enjoy him much more. Baby Groot of course takes some of the cake for his cuteness. Each character has their own little world which fits perfectly. With new faces to get to know as well. But I also have to mention Michael Rooker's character, Yondu. Again another character who stuck out in this film with more of a backstory and such a step up. An awesome character that is downright B.A. In the comics he is one of the original Guardians but for the film is a Ravager. But how Rooker plays Yondu is absolutely brilliant. I would go as far to say that he deserves an award for such a talented performance along with Bautista.The only downside I saw with this film is how it takes awhile before the story/plot come into play. You sort of wonder where it's going, but by the end of the film, it all comes together. You'll appreciate the way they do it. Otherwise I can't say anything I didn't like about it. Maybe some of the jokes weren't the best, but nowadays movies aren't funny. You will get some great laughs from this film and some great emotions from these characters. Don't miss 'Awesome Mix Vol. 2!' Or in other words, Guardians of the Galaxy!And don't forget to stay after the credits! Five post credit scenes!",10,7,12,19 May 2017
Sausage Party," One Long Joke That Fails
","I'll start by saying the story and plot of the movie was good. Or gave it the purpose to make an actually movie about talking food. Otherwise the movie itself, and I like to put it this way, is one long sex joke! Seriously. Besides a couple of morbid deaths of the food and other things that I was expecting more of, you get a lot of sex jokes. And most of the jokes bored me. It gave me a few chuckles but otherwise I was just not finding it funny. Believe they could have done better but I suppose with it starring Seth Rogen, I should have expected it to be a hit or miss and it was a miss. Close to the end of the movie, not the actually ending, but close enough a scene comes on in which I basically knew was coming. And when it happened, it was the most annoying and least bit of funny to watch. Won't go into detail but its a build up and you will either laugh or just wonder when it'll be over. I can't really find much good on the film. Animation was decent. If I had laughed more or didn't see that one coming moments I believe I would have rated the movie higher. But because I can't really think of much good from the film and how bored I was throughout it I truly believe the movie deserves a 4/10.Think this movie falls into the stoner movies and that could also explain why I didn't find it as funny either. It did however make me hungry thinking of food but the movie itself didn't make me feel guilty about going into the grocery store and 'killing' the food by eating it. All in all I recommend finding another movie, I prefer This Is The End also starring Seth Rogen and a few others. That movie was way better than this.",4,62,131,21 September 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," Cabin in the woods. What could go wrong?
","Alrighty. I saw trailers. I laughed at the title of the movie from thinking of the classic The Evil Dead. I had to see the movie. Not fully sure I knew what to expect when I went to see it. Wasn't too sure what I was walking into, a legit horror film or some dark comedy. Well as it turns out, from the beginning alone I saw it's mostly a dark comedy. From the very beginning to being introduce to the characters you know you won't be getting scared but laughing. Unless of course you are easily frighten. From the beginning to middle it was slow, I won't lie. I'd say character building. You could imagine what's going on from the start but the reason of, why??? You think it's another movie in the woods and college kids are gonna die. Once the end starts getting closer the movie picks up. And I believe from that alone that had me loving it. I knew what to expect but the ending still makes you think and laugh how they go and do it. So I have to give it 10/10. It made me laugh, got to know your characters. Confused you into what's going on. Turns into a slasher good time. And before you know it, the end just has you going. If you got an open mind, love to laugh, possibly get scared, who knows maybe even cry, I recommend it. I wasn't disappointed in anything about it. For a movie, sure it has certain moments. But hey what movie doesn't? Go and see it and check it out yourself. In my review, I loved it. A horror comedy about a cabin in the woods with a twist.",10,1,4,13 November 2014
Goodfellas," Average-fellas
","A true story about the New York City mobsters and the main man, Henry Hill. His rise and fall from the mob life. A film that is great in acting and storytelling of how the mobster life was like in the years ranging from 1955-1980. Great to watch for the history and what the people went through in their lives. With that said, the movie itself is just an average film which sadly shows us the fact that gangs and violence is out there in the real world.The film starts great and is amazingly well done. Martin Scorsese, the man who does very violent/crime/mob movies. And don't forget the profanity, this movie drops the F bomb. All together it doesn't affect the film. But nonetheless the movie takes you through the years with the mob family. The first act is well done, especially with meeting the characters. The second act fell flat and boring. It doesn't really hold your attention. Making you want the film to just hurry up and end. And when the end comes along it just leaves you feeling 'okay.' There is no big surprising moments, no memorable scenes. The dialogue on the other hand, plenty of famous lines. The acting was grand. Joe Pesci always outdoing himself. While again Robert De Niro does such an amazing job in his character portrayals. With Ray Liotta playing the lead role of Henry Hill who was perfect. Featuring many other actors and actresses who did such an awesome job on the film. And a surprise cameo of a young Samuel L Jackson! The list of actors and actresses was well picked for the film and everyone did a masterpiece. The story which is told from Henry and his wife's perspective. While again the film is pretty violent, it shows how it can put a toll on someone. From getting involved in fights, killings, drugs, and the overall mafia life. Eventually you are going to snap. But the way the story is told is like a long boring dull tone. Like a boring history lesson. A slow paced story. How the story is told of what really happen is just what you may read in a biography book. It is average, entertaining if you like that sort of thing. Not saying Scorsese did a bad job on the movie. 'Goodfellas' just feels overrated. Overall the movie is a straightforward average film. Ranging from the beginning to interesting to the ending being plain. Not a must see but if you got the time or like the mafia style films then go for it. Otherwise skipping this film will give you time to find another movie that is worth it. A greater movie suggestion would be another one of Scorsese's film, 'The Departed.'",7,0,2,19 April 2017
Alien: Covenant," Boring Tale of Aliens.
","A movie about aliens, you get crappy CGI of them and not much aliens, followed by the creation of them which is more confusing and boring. Surely the writers and Ridley Scott didn't even know how to explain it.The movie, boring. Everyone at this point should know this story is about the creation of Aliens. How they came about to wreck havoc in the classic and wonderful Alien Quadrilogy(The four movies). Then comes Prometheus(2012), the first prequel to the Alien story. Which wasn't that bad, average. And then Alien: Covenant(2017) which is the continuous story of how the Aliens came about. But at this point it gets so confusing and so many questions not being answered the movie turns out boring and annoying. Feeling like plot holes and stories aren't sticking. Not saying it does, but you get the feeling like the writers, Ridley Scott himself doesn't even know certain answers and skips over details. That is what this movie delivers.From that the movie has decent parts. Love the exploring and scenery landscape it showed. Visuals of space was amazing as well. Then you get let down when the aliens show up. The biggest let down in a movie. The aliens looked pathetic. Understandable that it is a different form of aliens unlike the ones we are use to, skinnier looking. Even the action involving the aliens was garbage. Graphics were horrid and the action of them didn't feel like Alien. Along with the fact that somehow this first 'aliens' take a lot more damage. So far crappy action with aliens with a boring backstory.Then we have the characters. I can say right now, most of the other reviews is truth. The most dumbfounded you'll get by their idiotic and what in the world decisions they make is just beyond stupid. So many issues could have been avoided if only they didn't make that one terrible mistake. Even if you panic realizing you are seeing an alien for the first time so you might panic and do something stupid, no no. We are talking about people who make this mission a suicide pact because they don't seem to know anything. An example, in the movie we have the pilot of the small carrier ship who locks two people in the medic bay due to possible contamination. Why was this scene utter horrible? Because the lady had multiple times to change the course to save herself and her friend, but no. So first she locks them in, goes to make a call, comes back(keep in mind she had blood sprayed in her face so she herself should worry about whatever this contamination thing is) and her friend who is begging to be let out she refuses. Then the alien comes out, so still screaming and panicking runs to grab a shotgun while leaving her friend locked in and not letting her out so together they both of them can team up. Nope she runs back and finds her friend getting attacked and possibly dead at this point from the alien, she goes in with the shotgun ready to shoot the alien and her friend in the face until she slips, freaks out and crawls back out closing the door on her leg. So she runs to gets another shotgun misses almost every shot, then blows up the ship with her bad aim. This lady should know the ship has explosives on board but doesn't care. This whole scene was utter trash. Which leaves the rest of the crew stuck on the planet waiting for help now. Then you get stupid decisions with the rest of the movie where no one seems to think. Like taking a ship with 2000 colonists of people very close to the planet to make contact with the crew risking the ship and lives of the 2000. Tough luck, the rest of the crew should have high tailed it out of there. I can go on about why this movie was terrible, plot holes, the worst crew alive. But the few parts I did enjoy was Michael Fassbender's character or being surprise by how much I like Danny McBride in this movie. Otherwise I wish it would have been so much better. A more simple story would have made it great. I'm still confused on who made the aliens. Anyways with all that said, if you are a fan of the Alien movies you will be disappointed. If you haven't seen the originals and want to watch this, you may or may not enjoy. But regardless you can't escape the stupid decisions the crew does and confusing backstory which makes the movie almost unwatchable. All in all, a one time watch and burn it.",4,3,6,5 July 2017
Evil Dead II," If you're looking for a good laugh, you found it.
","For a movie that wasn't a big budget. And the hero of B movies. Bruce Campbell pulls off an amazingly funny movie. Start to finish, the dark humor of this movie was well done. For anyone just wanting a goodnight laugh, Halloween marathon, or just wanting to watch a cheesy movie. If finishing this movie and you still want more, try out Army of Darkness. Sure like any other movie it has it's goofs, but it all just adds to the enjoyment of the movie to noticing these things. Without Sam Raimi we wouldn't have had this masterpiece. I have to give it 10/10 due to it just making me laugh and knowing so much has came from the Evil Dead movies. Comics, a musical, action figures. If you end up loving this movie, it just doesn't end with it. Go out and explore the love that came from this movie! Here ya go! And don't forget the original! The Evil Dead! Just as great and low budget! GROOVY!",10,6,7,8 November 2014
