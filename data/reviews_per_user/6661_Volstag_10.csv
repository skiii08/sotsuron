Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode I - The Ersatz Menace
","The Ersatz MenaceI don't even know where to begin.  For starters, even if this movie existed in a vacuum (w/ no relation to the original trilogy), it would still suck. I'm sorry: it's an out and out poor film.  When judged as a member of the Star Wars pantheon, it becomes totally abysmal.  It's as if Lucas decided to get rid of everything that was magical and wonderful about the first trilogy, and replace it with the most unimaginative feculence he could conjure up.  I'm serious.. it's like he purposefully tried to make the worst prequel he could.  I can't think of any other reason that would bring about this suppurating carbuncle of a movie.What's wrong with the movie?  For starters, this is a kids movie.  It was made for kids.  Those of us who grew up with the original series are totally left by the wayside.  Ostensibly, Lucas wants to tap into the disposable income of prepubescent consumers -- they'll buy more Jar Jar Binks paraphernalia than those of us in our 30s and 40s.  While that might make good business sense, it doesn't really make for a good movie.  Contrast that with the original Star Wars, or Empire Strikes Back -- they were gritty, and darkly ominous.  There was nothing cute -- for the sake of being cute (and selling toys) -- until we reach the end of Return of the Jedi (where, unbelievably, a race of upright hamsters (ewoks), using neolithic technology, somehow manages to defeat battle-hardened, particle beam weapon toting, Imperial Stormtroopers.  If stunted hirsute humanoids, using stone age weaponry, can defeat Imperial soldiers, how the heck did the Empire come to exist in the first place?!).  Back to my point: basically, you don't have to make a 'kids movie' to appeal to kids -- you more than proved that with A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.The pacing in this movie is so hurried.  It's like Lucas felt the need to cram as much stuff into the allotted run-time as possible.  We never get a chance to sit back and appreciate our surroundings, or learn much about the characters (beyond the purely superficial).  We just zip from one scene to the next.Jar Jar Binks: Quite possibly the worst character ever put to celluloid. I've got a tip for anyone making a movie: if you're going to have a character who is blatantly nothing more than comic relief, it would help if the character was actually funny -- as opposed to being downright annoying.Jake Lloyd was terrible as young Annikan.  I don't care if he's a kid... I've seen child actors who are light years better than Mr. Lloyd.  Also, what's the deal with Annikan 'accidentally' blowing up that Imperial capital ship?  Apparently, the Rebels should begin heavily recruiting precocious nine year olds -- apparently the empire has no defense against attacks that are simultaneously 'cute' and 'goofy'.I could go on forever about how disappointing this movie is -- but I'll stop here.  There was one highlight of this movie: Darth Maul.  He was, seriously, the only character that I liked.  Unfortunately, he only enjoys maybe 15 minutes screen time, and then he's summarily killed at the end. Too bad.My rating: 3/10.",4,1,2,8 June 2004
Scary Movie 2," Fun -- in a very dumb way.
","Low brow comedy 101.  Thankfully though, I don't think this movie is trying to be anything more than that.  It made me laugh, and that's all that I was asking from it.I gave it a 6/10.",6,0,2,3 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A fun movie, and a good adaptation of the book
","I'll freely admit that I am a Tolkien fan (and proud of it).  I've read the Hobbit twice, the Lord of the Rings at least six times, and the Silmarillion twice as well -- in addition to much of the 'unfinished' work.I went into this movie hoping for the best, but expecting the worst.Thankfully, the movie exceeded my expectations by quite a large margin. Peter Jackson has created a truly wonderful adaptation of the first book. I'm not going to call it a masterpiece, but it's a very entertaining and engaging movie.  Most importantly, Mr. Jackson managed to stay, for the most part, faithful to the source material.  There were some liberties taken: the role of Arwen (Liv Tyler) was expanded, the true impetus behind Sarumans evil machinations, the 'magic fight' between Gandalf and Saruman, the reasons for Merry & Pippin joining Frodo and Sam on their adventure, etc, etc.Most of this, IMO, came about because there is really no way that a single 3-hour movie can capture the staggering amount of 'history' and back-story that forms the core of the the series.  If Mr. Jackson had adhered strictly to the books, most of the audience would have been buried under obscure references and left the theatre scratching their heads in bewilderment (not to mention the runtime would have been, at least, 3x as long).  You have to read the books many times, in addition to voluminous amount of related material, to truly understand the epic scope of the history of Middle Earth and the War of the Ring.And, most importantly, let's not forget that Mr. Jackson (and the studio involved) has to make a movie that will appeal to those who know nothing about the world created by J.R.R. Tolkien.  Hence the reason for many of the 'changes' and the amped up action sequences.In short; Mr. Jackson managed strike a respectable balance between the works of Tolkien and the avarice of Hollywood.  Will it replace the books?  Not by a long shot.  It is, however, an entertaining movie from beginning to end, and it's a shame that we have to wait a year to see the rest of the story unfold.",9,0,0,19 December 2001
The Thing," Great flick
","This is one of my absolute favorite horror movies.  Primarily because it actually creates believable tension, and some truly frightening moments. It's also one of those rare movies in which the characters behave, for the most part, like a real person would in a similar situation (er, rather, how you'd like to _think_ a real person would be have in such a situation).I know Carpenter catches a lot of flack, but this movie alone proves that he does have a certain degree of talent (when it comes to horror movies).I gave it an 8/10.",8,1,2,3 February 2003
Van Helsing," Van Pointless
","Van Helsing is all smoke and mirrors.  It uses tremendous amounts of 'shock & awe' to hide the fact that it doesn't have a compelling story or interesting characters.  The whole experience was similar to watching someone play a video game for roughly 2 hours.  I also felt that this particular movie was suffering from an identity crisis: it could never decide what kind of movie it wanted to be.  Is it a comedy?  Is it horror? Is it drama?  It was, quite simply, trying to do too much with too little story to back it up.This movie was _almost_ bad enough to make it into a good movie (e.g. Troll II, Deathstalker III, etc), but, unfortunately, it also failed in that regard.* spoiler *What's the deal with Anna's (Beckinsale) family appearing in the clouds at the end of the movie?  That little segment was, arguably, the cheesiest thing I've seen in a movie in a looong time.I rated it a 5/10.",5,1,1,24 May 2004
Pearl Harbor," One of the worst movies ever made
","This movie is a perfect example of why big-budget Hollywood movies are total garbage.You'd think that the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor -- which resulted in the death of 2200+ soldiers/civilians -- would make for compelling drama. Apparently, Bruckheimer, Bay and Wallace didn't think that was dramatic enough.Bruckheimer: 'We really need to punch-up the drama. The surprise attack, the appalling loss of life, the chaos and disorder... it's just not dramatic enough.'Wallace: 'Hey, I know! Let's add an insipid, and totally irrelevant, love triangle into the mix!'Bruckheimer: 'Perfect! Now the attack on Pearl Harbor will have the *oomph* it needs!'This movie is a gigantic slap in the face to all the soldiers (Japanese and American) and civilians who lost their lives in this attack. Their travails, unbelievably, take a backseat to idiotic melodrama.Roger Ebert put it best when he said, 'Pearl Harbor is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec 7th 1941 the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle.'Rating: 1/10",1,3,6,29 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Almost great
","Short and to the point: too many tweaks, deletions and additions from the source material.  The pacing seemed a little jerky at times.  Mr. Jackson spends too much time lingering on details that weren't nearly as important in the book, and I can't see how they made it into the movie (basically everything concerning Arwen (Liv Tyler)).  Otherwise a decent film and worth seeing (definitely as a rental).  I considered FotR to be much superior as an adaptation and as a movie.Normally I would probably give this a 6/10, but since it's Tolkien I gave it a 7/10 out of respect.",7,0,0,11 January 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," Classic comedy
","After reading through many of the other user comments, I can really only say one thing: You either 'get it', or you don't.  Personally, I find this movie one of the most hilarious ever made.  I will agree, however, with the other comments that it's 'showing it's age', and that it does drag on at times (I had similiar feelings while watching Monty Python's 'Holy Grail' and 'Life of Brian', for example).Very few of the 'gags' are going to walk right up and slap you in the face. Most of the hilarity comes from watching these hapless blokes tumble further and further into the blackhole of obscurity.",8,0,1,23 June 2001
The Descent," Smart Horror
","The Descent features a team of British spelunkers exploring a cave system in the Appalachian region of the United States. As you can imagine, the deeper they delve, the more harrowing their situation becomes.The Descent, unlike most horror movies, features characters that are for the most believable. And, more importantly, they behave in a somewhat rational manner. There's no bimbos checking out 'mystery sounds', all alone, clad only in bikinis. It's tough chicks in for the fight of their lives.The movie does an admirable job of conveying a sense of claustrophobia and urgency in the beginning. To be honest, I thought the lead-up to the 'introduction' of the creatures was quite a bit creepier than the creatures themselves. As a matter of fact, once the creatures make their presence known, the movie does tend to devolve into more traditional slasher fare.But, in the end, it's a decent horror movie with some downright chilling moments. Definitely worth checking out.7/10",7,1,3,15 August 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Didn't live up to the expectations (for me)
","I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan. I've liked (loved?), and laughed at, most of his movies. Talledega Nights, however, just didn't live up to the expectations I had going in. I'm not sure if this a problem with me or the movie itself.In a nutshell, the movie simply wasn't as funny as I was hoping it to be. I really thought I'd be treated to the same level of hilarity that I found in 'The Anchorman' (for example). Sadly, that wasn't the case. While there are certainly some gut busting moments, when viewed as a whole it just wasn't firing on all cylinders (pun intended). There were several stretches of the movie where I found myself barely chuckling, and _almost_ wondering when it was going to be over.I thought many of the characters, notably Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Mrs. Dennit (Molly Shannon), were under utilized. I also felt like the ad-libbing (if such was the case) simply wasn't gelling as well as it has in previous Ferrell vehicles.In the end, it's a moderately funny movie (with a few gems), but don't expect anything on the level of 'The Anchorman' or 'Old School'.I gave it a 6/10.",6,5,13,4 August 2006
