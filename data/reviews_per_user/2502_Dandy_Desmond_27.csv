Saturday Night Fever," I'm going nowhere...somebody help me....
","Saturday Night Fever is one of those films that exists in the very top bracket of film making yet has many flaws that are overcome by the sheer raw power of the message in the film and the development of the characters. John Travolta will never be better as Tony Manero. We first meet Tony strutting down the street holding a can of paint, checking out all the ladies to the sound of Stayin Alive by The Bee Gees. (iconic shot - simple and has been imitated many times) and from that moment you are hooked into his world, his friends and are charmed into his lifestyle of sex, booze and great dancing. At first like Tony you are enjoying yourself and think he has it made. This is what makes this movie great. As Tony discovers the little world that he is king of is nothing but a shallow empty shell of existence, you do too. You discover this with him. His friends are all idiots, the girls flinging themselves at him every Saturdays are whores and he can be so much more than this. Another theme of the movie is the way people treat each other. Even Tony is not a hero in any sense of the word. He is not a good friend himself, he treats girls like dirt and is very selfish. A few examples include his treatment of Donna Pescow's character who seems lovely if a little dumb. He also permanently ignores a friends call for help until the guy goes berserk and falls off a bridge high on drugs - even then all Tony can think about is himself. However you still like him. This is down to John Travolta and his career defining performance as he is a real person. People are selfish, people rarely listen and Saturday Night Fever captures this in gritty real detail. Another great aspect of this film is the 'love interest' Stephanie. Now Stephanie is not a six foot amazonian blonde with great big artificial hooters teenage boys can lust after. She is a normal looking woman who has her own flaws. She is also quite selfish, snobby if you like trying to rise above her roots and upbringing to a better life. Tony is attracted to her as she does not react to his advances and often lets him down as he does other women. Stephanie as a character I understand is not well liked amongst a section of the SNF fans but she is very necessary to the plot and is played in a comical manner by Karen Lynn Gorney as we discover she is really no cleverer or sophisticated than Tony.A special mention also needs to go to Donna Pescow who is cute as a button and the arc her character takes makes your heart break. She didn't deserve that! I thought she was the stand out hottie of the film hands down - that rack! Anyway I was supposed to be giving a serious insight into the movie...where was I....ah yesSaturday Night Fever also contains some of the most iconic moments in seventies cinema - I am not fan of disco or dancing at all but even I think these scenes are brilliant. Overall it is a film that you have to re visit every now and then, perhaps now over looked by a modern generation that file it alongside Grease as cheesy dance film. A shame really as it is also a powerful character study and a great ride if you decide to take it.",10,0,1,31 March 2011
Source Code," Excellent - but cops out when it matters
","Spoilers! I must admit I saw Moon and wanted to see this immediately after and am most impressed, it sort of reminded me of The Jacket with Keira Knightly and Adrian Brody. I love the way director Duncan Jones takes his time to unravel a story, you learn with the main character what is going on every step of the way and grow to have empathy with him/her. My only problem which I feel may have been caused by test screenings, which is mentioned quite frequently on IMDb is the ending. Just when it seemed to stop at the perfect moment, the main character finally gets to call his dad, arranges for a comedian to entertain the passengers and with seconds to live, kisses the girl and all the victims of the disaster are laughing and smiling and it freezes, I expected it to fade to black ... perfect, emotional and a logical conclusion. but no.. it decides to go on a little longer as the couple go on a date, and there's a text message...and.. well it takes the shine off what would have been a truly memorable film. Its still excellent though but so close to being perfect.",8,1,3,3 May 2012
Casablanca," Brave ending makes this a classic
","The Classics Tour: Part 1 'Casablanca'I thought I was a movie geek but then realised I had not seen hardly anything pre 1960 - I'm about to change that. First stop Casablanca. What first struck me about Casablanca was the script, sharp and witty at times and include more classic lines that you could erm... well lots of classic lines. Yes many lines from this film have been said time and time again and are part of our culture now. The final lines Bogie utters to the lovely Ingrid Bergman before she leaves I had heard before and I hadn't seen the film! Next Humphrey Bogart. He's a really cool guy and his performance in this movie is pitch perfect I aim to watch some more of this mans movies. Casablanca surprised me I must admit. The ending is brave indeed and contributes to its legendary status of that I have no doubt. Any ending where the lead doesn't get the girl, where the love rival is as brave if not braver just adds layers to an already great story with such a crackling script. Its hard to recommend this film as many sadly would not get over its age. To be fair it has taken me a while to get round to appreciating old films but there is a whole gold mine out there and I can't wait to get stuck in. I am delighted to admit for me personally Casablanca lived up to its reputation.",9,3,4,27 November 2011
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Instant Classic
","Rogue One is comfortably the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi. So I'll tell you where I'm at. I love the original films - I grew up with them as a child of the 80s. I think the prequels are rubbish, I don't really watch cartoons and the Force Awakens left me cold. Personally I thought Star Wars was done. But at least I had the original films. Untouchable. So I thought...I walked out of the cinema totally satisfied I had seen an instant classic. It is bold, exciting, funny, tragic and most of all entertaining. I won't go into the story, as most people know that its how the rebels stole the plans to the Death Star, which was destroyed in Star Wars (1977) Rogue One manages in its 2 hours 10 mins run time to bring together a motley crew of characters, give them each sufficient screen time for you to care about them before putting them on a suicide mission. Its a true ensemble piece, and almost feels like The Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen or the Wild Bunch in space. As the film was playing I felt it was good, then towards the end I thought wow they are actually going to do it. They are actually all going to die and the last 40 minutes are incredible. As I was reeling from this, the director Gareth Edwards then produces the real moment of the film. The jewel in the crown. Darth Vader after taking a back seat for most of the film, after many security failures by Krennic (a fantastic little worm of a character played by the terrific Ben Mendelsohn) takes matters into his own hands in brutal fashion. Following this scene, the film ends with Princess Leia, as Star Wars begins.The film has many strengths. Gareth Edwards being the key. He hasn't just made a lazy remake of the original. This film stands alone, yet fits totally alongside the first three in style, execution and with panache.I just want to touch on the humour as well. It has moments of humour that does not resort to slap stick as seen in the horrific prequels, where CGI creatures fart or C3P0's head ends up on another droids body (really? yep it really happened) Yes, finally a film that cares for its characters more than the CGI. Yes, this is the film that gave Darth Vader his balls back. Yes, this is the film that dared kill off the whole cast. Yes, the Star Wars film that highlights how bad the prequels and The Force Awakens is. Yes, I loved it. Can you tell?",10,3,9,17 April 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," I canny handle it ...its going doon captain!
","It seems to have polarised opinions. In one corner the Star Trek devotees who wanted a more pure Gene Roddenberry vision based on the Star Trek legacy and values and in the other corner, the teenage 100mph video game generation, senses so obliterated by technology that attention spans are severely limited, who want CGI sp*nkfests, loud, fast and violent films like Transformers & Pacific Rim.Well thats the simplified version based on Internet chatter I've read.I could not give a monkeys chuff about that. The hard truth is from a neutral perspective Star Trek Into Darkness is not very good. It started well, for half an hour or so it seemed interesting but gradually the story revealed itself to be wafer thin, then gave in to all out action and CGI set pieces and eventually refused to end. There are two main problems with this film, first of all there is too much action in it. Is that a fault? I think so as in the end character interaction, and the building up of tension is replaced by an assault of impressive computer generated explosions, lazers, lens flares, fighting, running, screaming, shouting, running, fighting, explosions..... Also it did not seem to want to end, which indicates to me the makers have really tried to throw everything but the kitchen sink at this film to really entertain. Entertain the masses that is - not the fan base. Short term the studio will think it kicks ass, however long term as a quality film its forgettable and will quickly disappear. Secondly, the whole Khan thing. I'm afraid Its been done before but better, it just didn't work and the copying of scenes and dialogue and reversing the Spock/Kirk death scene was not clever it was stupid for two reasons. 1. You know Kirk will not die - so whats the point of it? And two as they have no real relationship there is no emotion from the viewer. At this point I was really thinking just give him the damn magic blood so he can pop back to life and lets finish this turkey. What I liked about the first film was it was quite original and fresh, this isn't. I don't hate it, I just find myself sighing and shrugging my shoulders. I would file it alongside Transformers, Pacific Rim and all the other CGI heavy nonsense I will watch once and never visit again. As a little end note, Simon Pegg recently told fans who voted this the worst ever ST film to F off! Its ironic that I found Scotty in this movie to be the Jar Jar Binks type character, meaning to be comic relief but turns out plain irritating. How strange Simon does not mind ripping George Lucas apart for the Star Wars prequels but now the shoe is on the other foot he becomes a little touchy. How ironic.",5,0,2,8 September 2013
"I Love You, Man"," Paul Rudd rocks
","I love Paul Rudd, I know when I watch a Paul Rudd movie I will laugh. Finally is he starting to get his own movies and in the lead role here he doesn't disappoint. He is ideal to play the everyman, the guy you can identify with. Paul plays Peter Klaven, a guy who has always had a girlfriend and because of this never any close male friends. When he gets engaged he realises that he has no guy friends and never has had and he sets out to find a 'best friend'. Watching Paul Rudd in agony, not being able to understand the guy lingo and squirm as he says the stupidest things is great and shows what a comedy talent he is. Its really a feelgood comedy at heart despite the crude language and behaviour a lot like previous films such as 40 year old Virgin etc and at the moment this seems to be a popular type of film and I'm glad as its just how I like em! I really hope Paul Rudd sticks to this type of movie and continues to make us laugh for many films to come.",8,2,4,5 July 2010
Zodiac," Masterful film making
","David Fincher's Zodiac will perhaps not be remembered as his best work. It certainly is not his showboat piece as that is Fight Club. its not his most shocking film which is probably Seven. In the hands of a less than superior film maker Zodiac could have been an exploitation film. Fincher does not dwell on the murders, sure they need to be seen as part of telling the story but he does not use this as an excuse to feed the gore hounds. Instead he chooses to focus on three people who lost something to the Zodiac other than their lives. Robert Downey Jr plays Paul Avery, a newspaper reporter who was threatened by Zodiac. Paul, who may have been heading down this path anyway, became lost in drink and drugs. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the SF Chronicle, who becomes obsessed with solving the case and eventually alienates his family. The most powerful performance comes from Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi. Subtle and measured he is outstanding in the role. Toschi was a legendary cop who Bullit was based on -but didn't solve this case. The real star is David Fincher who puts together a complicated story, makes it understandable and keeps your interest for quite a long film. Also the scene by the Lake is one of the most disturbing I have ever seen. I watch lots of horror films but this scene I find difficult to watch, maybe because it was based on a real poor girl but also as it is directed in such a way to stay with you. Zodiac at heart is a sober character study. There is no deviation away from telling the story just to appease a target audience. Fincher made this movie to tell the story of Zodiac and the people involved. It does its best to solve the murders but as in real life there is no closure. Some may find this unsatisfactory but thats how it is. Zodiac is not Finchers most remembered film, but for me it remains his best to date.",10,1,1,4 September 2010
Notting Hill," 'You know what they called him at school?'
","Was it ploppy? or floppy. I can't remember, by that time I had ordered pizza and hookers and couldn't care less what they called him, who was the most pathetic at the party or anything else these cartoon characters spewed from their poisonous hideous ploppy floppy lips. Hugh Grant is hugh grant in a hugh grant film, starring Julias teeth and a bunch of life long jobbing British upper class actors. How I hooted for the first 10 minutes but thats probably down to the E kicking in - still with a mood enhancing drug inside me I was left feeling utterly disgusting and ill by this boring typically British puff piece. Anyone from outside the Uk must think we all have dinner parties, act like deranged batty history professors and secretly loath ourselves under our posh stiff upper lipped exteriors. I just hate myself for not banging Nicola Taylor at Uni. I expect any Hollywood actress coming to London would fall for a tumbling idiot who works in a book shop or owns it or whatever. Next time Scarlett Johansson is in London I must brush up on my stuttering, slightly awkward, spineless bimbo act and I may be right in there.I loved it.",1,15,39,27 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Period Drama Slow
","I won't go into the story as there is too damn much to go through and anyone watching this film that has not watched the first 6 is wasting their time anyway. So the first part of the final part is basically the first half of the book. Director David Yates I believe has done a fine job so far, however he must have taken the job of directing the final part of the story on the basis he does as he is told by splitting it in 2 and basically filming the book. What I have liked about the films so far is that they have branched out and cut all the excess fat from the novels and were entertaining. I believe the first two Harry Potters are the weakest of the movies as they simply filmed the whole book. I'm afraid this has what has happened with Deathly Hallows - its a long, long slow boring movie. Almost a period drama in its solemn and serious face. I saw it in the cinema and instantly disliked it - my brother has now bought the blu ray so I gave it another chance and I'm afraid its still as slow and dull as I remember. Important moments like the death of hedwig are simply passed off and the story moves on without a moments tension, drama or emotion. It just feels like it doesn't get out of first gear, the movie is in a trance - you wait for something, anything interesting to happen and it just doesn't. The big mistake was splitting it in two and filming everything that was in the book. If I want all that I'll read it again I don't have to sit through 2 and a half hours of people walking about in a forest and field to get to the end. As I watch the series of Harry Potters now on blu ray this will be the film I get to and think urrghh i have to sit through this to get to the very end. I find that really annoying as so far all the movies are entertaining. Even the first two which I think are quite weak are at least entertaining, Deathly Hallows is not, its very serious, very stoic and very very dull. Having said that the production values and acting are all very good as usual but its just a shame they had to drain every last drop out of the cash cow and almost ruin the series.Well I'm boring myself now so I'll switch off.",5,9,11,12 April 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Money Spinner
","I felt nothing when this film finished, not even entertained, thats its problem. Its soul less, filled with average special effects, empty characters and a thin plot. Someone mentioned twilight, I understand that - maybe I am a little old for what appears to be more a teen film than say The Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen or hell even Captain America. Andrew Garfield is the loner, sulky guy who mumbles a lot but doesn't have to try very hard for Emma Stone to like him. Add to that the complete lack of chemistry between them (on screen) that for some reason has them standing round in corridors mumbling to each other for what seemed like forever. I love superhero films, but I am getting a little bored with the CGI crap fests which I thought Batman had ridden us of. This unfortunately is one of them. Sam Raimi's films suffered the same however at least had likable characters. I didn't get the point of the police chief, Uncle Ben was confusing, the build up to Spider man first appearing was under cooked and the finale was poor (and shown in the trailer) Then we have the Lizard. Another bad CGI cartoon jumping around smashing things. To be honest during the 'fight' scenes I was bored with the shoddy special effects that don't really look any better than the previous films. Finally my biggest complaint. Lets not get confused about why this film was made. To make more money. If it was a great film, that would be forgiven but its not.",5,1,3,2 December 2012
Batman Begins," Starts like a train and peters out a little
","Taking a queue from Superman (1978) Chris Nolan goes back to the origins of Bruce Wayne and how he became Batman. Taking time (just under an hour like Superman) to flesh out the back story and provide the audience with a strong understanding of what makes Bruce Wayne do what he does. The first hour or so of Batman Begins is perfect, the training montages, the flashbacks to childhood through the death of Wayne's parents to his exile in the criminal world. Liam Neeson is perfect as his mentor and Christian Bale was an excellent casting decision, refreshing to pick a man rather than a younger guy to appeal to the younger crowd.However as we move into the latter part of the film I feel it lose momentum. As much as I admire Cillian Murphy as an actor I don't see him as Scarecrow and he doesn't really hit the right note for me. I loved Tom Wilkinson as the gang boss I feel he was greatly underused. Katie Holmes does try to give her character some balls but comes across a little whiny and unsympathetic to Bruce, perhaps this is a writing flaw.Anyway Neeson returns for the films showdown which is quite good and we have the calling card from the Joker at the end. One thing this movie does is set up the foundations for The Dark Knight which in my opinion is a superior film. So for me this is a great Batman movie but in terms of origin of superhero movies Superman remains my favourite.",Null,0,2,20 August 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Immersive
","A snap shot of a couple of people involved in Hollywood in 1969. One actor is Sharon Tate (Robbie), she lives with the hottest director in town and her career is sparking.Next door is an actor by the name of Rick Dalton (DiCaprio). He used to be a lead on TV, but his career is heading downhill and he is beginning to feel it.
His stunt double is also his best friend (Pitt), who has been pretty much blacklisted in Hollywood due to rumours about his personal life.The first hour 45 or so you are immersed in this world and follow the characters in their daily lives.
The film takes a dark turn as Pitts character picks up a hitch hiker who happens to be one of the Manson Family and things escalate from there.As the title suggests, this is a fairytale, set in a particular time in Hollywood and the events of the movie enhance this. Real people intermix with fictional characters and it is all very interesting even after viewing to put together what was real and what was not.There has been criticism of the lack of lines for Margot Robbie from some female critics. They seem to feel Tarantino should have shoe horned in more lines to 'improve' his film and to fit their agenda. I'm tired of this rubbish.. thankfully Tarantino does not need to be bullied and stoop to pandering to these idiots and will make the film he wants to make.Sharon Tate is presented on screen as he envisioned. As a happy young woman, whose career is going the right way. In a stand out scene, she joins an audience in a cinema to watch one of her own films. This part (without lines, just her reaction) is one of the highlights of the film.
What I also like about this sequence is that the real Sharon Tate is also on screen, acting in comedic moments and some kick ass moments showing the world she was more than just a victim of the Manson Family.Another stand out scene for me was DiCaprio after a long sequence filming a part in a TV Western series, then blows his lines. Its so awkward and is followed by a total meltdown in his trailer. He then goes back and nails the performance. A little girl tells him its the best acting she has ever seen, which makes him very emotional.When the Manson Family show up at Cielo Drive, your heart begins to sink a little, knowing what is to come.However, this is a fairy tale set in Hollywood and perhaps there is still appetite in this cynical world for a Hollywood ending.",9,22,35,16 August 2019
Get Out," Overrated
","Recently saw this on Netflix, remembered there was a lot of positivity, that it was 'genuinely unsettling' so was excited to see what it would have in store.In my opinion, it was overrated. Massively.First of all the good things, the lead actors are very good and the director manages to create a few unsettling moments and an atmosphere is definitely there. It reminded me a bit of Society in terms of tone, which is the better film I think.However, this tense atmosphere is abruptly interrupted whenever the 'comic' best friend makes an appearance. Took me right out of the picture. He did make me laugh in the beginning, but I was getting annoyed with him by the end.Also once I found out what was actually happening, I was disappointed and the ending is generic survivor kills all the evil people and escapes routine.Again, I found it to be ok. Not particularly memorable or deserving of this praise and certainly not oscar material! What a laff, I thought The Witch would have been more fitting oscar material if I had to pick a 'horror' film.",4,7,12,18 March 2019
Insidious," Above average
","I went to see Insidious on the back of the released stills of the movie which showed promise - I have usually been let down, this time I wasn't. I really enjoyed it. It also succeeded in making the audience cower in their seats, making girlfriends cling onto boyfriends arms, nervous laughter after the scares and most importantly having the ability to stay with you long after it has finished. Insidious plot is standard with a little twist. Man and wife with young family move into haunted house (you think) slamming doors, voices, strange faces its all here. Toss in the psychic woman, the gadgets to capture changes in temperature and you have the usual set pieces. Influences are very obvious but never directly copied as Insidious definitely makes its own stamp in the haunted house movie genre. What can also normally disappoint me in some of these ghost films is the ghosts are never shown enough, here they are and although some of the ghosts miss the mark, there are some genuinely frightening moments. It also manages to keep interest as it switches from a creepy movie to almost a monster movie for me it did lose its tense edge when this happened but at least it never got boring. For gore hounds and torture porn horror fans this is not for you - it is more poltergeist, the fog and the Shining than Saw or Hostel. As a big horror fan myself I would recommend it as a fun scary ride.",7,3,7,6 May 2011
The Number 23," 6 out of 10 - which is only 16 not 23....
",I love Jim Carrey. I think he is great at comedy and he can also do a good turn in a straight film. I knew the plot before going into the film and I couldn't get my head round the fact someone could go 'crazy' over a number. About 20-30 minutes into the film I was still thinking the same thing but hey Jim was being mildly amusing and Virginia Madsen was looking smoking hot... I did sort of 'get' it towards the end and understood he felt the character in the novel was so close to his own character but still the story wasn't that strong although I did enjoy it. I've did look for 23 in everything after the movie but I'm so bad at maths I give up after a few attempts. Worth a watch.,6,2,4,30 August 2009
Kick-Ass," Over hyped, trendy nonsense.
","I was very disappointed with kick ass. Everyone who had seen it told me how good it was, that it was laugh out loud funny original etc and I liked the concept.What I watched was a disjointed mess of a movie that didn't know if it was a comedy, action flick or comment on society. We have what appears to be a comedy at the beginning, an ordinary boy with no superpowers who wants to do some good. Buys a horrible suit and wants to be a superhero. So his first mission he confronts two men stealing a car then gets stabbed in the stomach? Was this meant to be funny? When he recovers he finds a girl he fancies at school thinks he is gay so he goes along with it (hilarious - laugh out loud? not really) and we meet a pre teen girl who says c*nt and c*ck a lot which again isn't really funny or original (see The Last Boy Scout - 1991).So what is kick ass? I really don't know - I turned it off after an hour and I don't do that lightly. Either i was sold a different movie or sadly this appears to appeal to todays audience. Kids killing people and swearing. Cool! It came highly recommended but I thought it stunk. Obviously this must be what counts as comedy for todays young generation - sad cos there is not an original laugh in it.",1,5,14,11 September 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Where are all the heroes now?
","First of all I came out of the screening having watched a sometimes funny and entertaining sci fi film. This is not enough for a Star Wars film. I did like all the new characters in The Force Awakens (apart from Hux - the performance and character is an utter embarrassment), but I've always felt there was no more story to tell with the old cast after Return of the Jedi and I'm still yet to be convinced. Again Rey has had NO training and she is able to do amazing things.. because well it doesn't need explaining. She's just Rey. Its BAD lazy writing. If Rian Johnson wanted Leia to show her force power, why not have her lift all the rocks at the end? And save her floating through space in a very amusing fashion. There is also no pacing, no crescendos and nothing to look forward to in the next part. So whats the point? The juvenile will they/won't they between Rey and Kylo, lifted from this years episode of Love Island? Is this what its come to?Star Wars was filled with wonder. It was about heroes.
Star Wars success and main pull was to take us away for a couple of hours to a galaxy far far away with evil empires, the princess, the farm boy, the scoundrel come good to fight the good fight. All wrapped up with great music and thrilling special effects. This film has an agenda and it doesn't impress me. It simply wants to overthrow the old and replace it with a new hip cast and cynical edge.
Its sad in this Game of Thrones day and age that we feel we need to put down and kill all our heroes. If it be to usher in the new or for pure shock value. **Update: My brother bought the blu ray and insisted I give it another go. I'm afraid its worse second time around. Too many times I cringed at the comedy, the floating Leia, how Rey still has yet to have any kind of character arc, why Luke was such a negative character. I could go on and on. I won't be bothering with the last instalment. As I mentioned above, Jedi ends the story, there is nothing more to see here. Even less so now.",1,3,4,28 December 2017
Clash of the Titans," CGI Borefest
","Another big budget, brainless, CGI action fest from the underbelly of Hollywood. New in thing Sam Worthington stars in what turns out to be a effects heavy and ultimately boring film. Liam Neeson does his Liam Neeson - Ralph Fiennes does voldemort again. Gemma Arterton appears as nothing more than a bit of fluff for the boys. and we have a few more familiar faces trying to act all noble in ridiculous wigs and clothing. Perseus is found in the sea as a baby, it turns out he is the son of a god. A god called Hades (Fiennes) accidentally kills his earth dad and he sets out for revenge to Kill him. We also have Hades threatening destruction to Argos (not the shop the city) unless they sacrifice their princess Andromeda to the Kraken in 10 days. So Perseus and his motley crew set off to find a way to kill the Kraken. The slight change in the story from the original (as I remember anyway) has an effect on the film. Andromeda has no link to Perseus and is replaced really with Gemma Artetons Io for no reason. In the original I remember Perseus was on a mission to save Andromeda because he loved her. No not in this one he is driven by hate but hate leads to the dark side. No hang on thats a different one. Anyway it doesn't really matter as this film was utter tosh due to the need to fill nearly every frame with CGI. Rush any in between stuff then get on to the next big set piece. The worst example is the scene involving Medusa. This should have been tense and scary but guess what?....yes they turned it into another action scene with a giant CGI Medusa snake thing wriggling around like a bloody computer game end of level boss. I don't recommend this film. I am seriously considering never seeing a film with Sam Worthington and his whispery voice ever again. Gemma Arterton is a fox though. Enough to Kraken one off to. ha ha",4,2,3,1 August 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Not as good as I'd heard
","Let me tell you this straight, this movie is not great. Its not a horror, not scary and not really funny enough to qualify for comedy/horror. If this movie had been made by an unknown director it would have gone straight to DVD. I like the Evil Dead movies and I think the fact this is made by the same director gives it the attention is doesn't deserve, like many Wes Craven jobs. Lots of gross stuff like maggots being poured onto a girls face, corpses drooling over peoples faces etc....yawn... I'd heard this was really good and entertaining but it goes down the unfortunate route of a person creeping about when they hear a noise in the other room then ...bang! jump out of your seat. Sorry its been done time and time again and its not scary its annoying!lastly I could see the ending coming a mile off and it was rubbish. I give it 3 out of 10 as the lead actress was good. So my conclusion is it was a waste of my time and money stick to Spiderman Sam.",3,2,6,1 November 2009
La La Land," Emotion over spectacle
","I'm not big on musicals, but something about La La Land interested me to go and see it. I do admire Ryan Goslings previous work so that could have been it alongside the idea of making an old fashioned musical in the modern world I found interesting. The musical numbers are very good, but they are not as spectacular as I imagined they were going to be and not as spectacular as what I have seen in old Hollywood movies. However on reflection, I don't think it is trying to be. The dance scenes go for emotion rather than spectacle.Other than that it was a really simple story well told. The look of the film is gorgeous, its set in LA, but its an LA that doesn't really exist except in the movies. Its a film designed to simply entertain and take you away for a couple of hours, and I must admit, it does that very well. Gosling and Stone have enough chemistry to carry the simple plot throughout and there are funny moments, romantic moments and sad moments. The seasonal changes gave me an inkling from the start as to where the film was going in terms of the ending but I did eventually like the way it didn't end too sugar coated. One big drawback however will be the endless poor imitators that will come along on the back of it!",8,5,10,16 January 2017
Psycho," Genius
","I recently watched this film having not seen it for a long time. After being numbed by a lot of crap horror movies lately I was taken aback by the films genius. The first half of the movie, if you hadn't seen it before, you would think is about the stolen money, that Norman is going to steal the money from Marion and escape his 'trap'. This all changes when the woman we have spent a while getting to know is murdered in a memorable shower scene by a woman in black. Norman cleans up after 'mother' and dumps all her belongings including the money he didn't know was there in the swamp! So what next? This is the genius of Psycho. Janet Leigh was a big star at the time and to see her dispatched so coldly would have been a great shock and after all she was the main character wasn't she? Brilliant. Anthony Perkins is outstanding as the nervous but friendly Norman Bates. There is no showmanship to his performance, it is ahead of its time. Janet Leigh is equally outstanding as the doomed Marion Crane and when she is killed you miss her for the rest of the film. The weak link is John Gavin, he is the old school of actor, very handsome and strong leading man type which in contrast to Tony Perkins modern approach shows badly. When they share a scene together you can see the difference in class between them but its a minor flaw. Finally Bernard Herrmann wrote a wonderfully twisted and eerie score to accompany Hitchcocks sure direction. Its a work of genius. If you haven't seen it - get it on your list!",10,0,1,2 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Too little too late
","When George Lucas announced he was to make a trilogy of movies that told the back story to the original Star Wars films I was delighted. After The Phantom Menace I was a little disappointed but I assumed he was trying to attract a new generation of kids to Star Wars and then move on with the story. Then Attack of the Clones happened, the worst Star Wars film. Terrible acting and again the story concentrates on the Clone Wars and not on the fact Anakin is supposed to be turning to the dark side any time soon. So two films pass and not much has happened, Palpatine has moved up in power, Anakin kills some sandpeople and falls in love during a terrible 20 minute spell.So it leaves Mr Lucas with one film to deal with the really interesting stuff of Anakin turning to the dark side, the disintegration of the friendship of Anakin and Obi Wan, Palpatine becoming the Emperor, the birth of Luke and Leia and the exile of Yoda. So it leaves around 2-3 scenes for Anakin to go from hero, noble Jedi with 'some' issues to become a child killer. It just doesn't work. I think George left himself a little too much to do in one film. It also suffers from the fact he felt the need to have C3P0, R2D2 and Chewbacca included. I think Mr Lucas needed someone to stand up to him a bit and tell him in the earlier movies that the plot was plodding along too much and the script was clunky. Who is going to do that though? its George Lucas baby and he can do what he wants with it. Fair enough I won't go into the acting - I don't really blame the actors, they were working in an empty blue room with a terrible script. One exception being Ian McDiarmid - his performance was brilliant. 7/10 is not a bad score for your average film. Its entertaining but you are always thinking it was too rushed and too little too late.",7,1,3,10 July 2010
Carrie," A Modern Tragedy
","I watched Carrie again for the first time in years, having seen the trailer for the remake with Chloe thingybob from the god awful Kick Ass. Its a tragic tale about a shy girl called Carrie White who seems to get abuse and bullying by almost everyone she meets, her mother, classmates even annoying kids on bikes. Her mother is a religious nut case, therefore she has had no knowledge or understanding of the world and is left open to bullying from other kids due to the fact she is different. What no one knows is how different Carrie really is. She is already realising she can move things with her mind at the start of the movie, therefore its not dragged down with learning to use her 'powers' etc and instead concentrates on the story. For the story is not only about her ability, its an all too human tale of someone looking for acceptance, to be loved and its this that makes it so memorable. Its a very cruel movie for several reasons. First of all the bullying is quite nasty and humiliating, secondly then with help of one of the few sympathetic class mates Carrie gets her dream date for the prom (after initial scepticism) and during the prom she is genuinely happy for once in her life and these scenes are very touching. As a viewer we know its not going to end there however, we know the fall will come and DePalma expertly creates the ominous atmosphere before the bucket of blood comes crashing down all over her. What comes next is a split screen massacre as Carrie wipes out almost the entire Prom Night goers in a rage fuelled inferno. Carrie is a film that has that magic mix. DePalma's sure direction is excellent (even the quirky touches such as the fast forward work for me) Sissy Spacek, words are not enough to explain her shattering performance. It really is something. I've always been a fan of Pino Donnaggio and his work here is one, if not the best soundtrack he has ever done. Highly recommended.",10,2,2,25 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Absolutely average
","The Force Awakens started out as 'a new hope' for the Star Wars franchise. The holy trilogy is what it is - movie watching at its grandest. Then came the prequels and in my case, they were all poor and get worse with each passing year whenever I stumble across them on TV. The trailers were outstanding for this film, practical effects, locations and sets - it FELT like Star Wars again and of course the famous 'Chewy, we're home' made me very excited. I'll start with some good things - I liked all the new characters and the acting was superior to the prequels. You know what I even liked Kylo Ren who I understand people have a lot of hate for - i think there's more to come from him. Unfortunately thats where it goes downhill. The reality is that this is not in the same league as the original films, but disappointingly for the same reason most modern action films suffer. Character/story development are replaced with more and more action set pieces. For example there was one strange scene where Han, Chewy, Rey and Fin are in a ship running away from these large squid like monsters, a Scottish bloke and the blokes from The Raid (took me out of the film) and it seemed to go on forever. For me it was an unnecessary 10 minutes that could have been dropped for some more explanation as to what the hell had gone on between Return of the Jedi and now. A few things that really bothered me:1. Rey - loved the character and Daisy Ridley did a great job. The characters development from scavenger to Jedi happens too quickly though.2. Han Solo - Came across as a little pathetic. Still a smuggler at his age? When I first heard Harrison Ford was back I immediately thought he would be killed off. However I thought he would go out with a bang, not a whimper. I love Harrison Fords early work, but he clearly has no love for Star Wars and probably couldn't care less how Solo went out. I understand he is bringing back Indiana Jones again - so if he wants to depress us some more by showing how a previous heroic character ends up a bit pathetic why not call it Indiana Jones and the Lonely Heart attack in the Care Home?3. Starkiller Base - looked like a butt hole. The empire has been done before. And better. 4. The x-wing/tie fighter action was quite dull5. Music - John Williams is a legend, however there were no moments I got goosebumps through his music like I have done before. He set the bar pretty high with previous movies to be honest! All in all I find myself strangely shrugging my shoulders about it. It was OK, nothing special - I feel like I have seen it all before and if I am being honest I never believed there was any story to tell after Jedi and this film hasn't really changed my mind.",5,21,28,29 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It all ends..... badly
","Harry Potter ends - so here it is the epic story reaches its conclusion and we have the complete set of films all finished. Oh dear... Like the novels the movies were really building up to become something great and I write this in utter disbelief but the ending, the ending to end all endings is a huge HUGE disappointment. I didn't think it would be possible to botch the end so much, I had my suspicions after the way the first part turned out but hats off to David Yates but he did it, he really messed it up big time. First of all I hated part 1 but I was led to believe the first part was merely a build up to an all action emotion wrecking finale. I was wrong. You may believe you are about to witness the long promised 'battle for hogwarts' involving all the characters you have grown to love over the past seven films. Wrong again. In fact Neville apart you hardly see any other characters in it - you follow Harry alone, his thoughts, his decisions while the battle is happening elsewhere. Characters you have invested time in getting to know over the years die off screen with no emotional involvement, I wanted to follow Tonks, Lupin, George and Fred etc in the battle become tense as each of these are now fighting for their lives. ... I wanted to be devastated when these characters are taken away from us, I wanted to feel the vengeance that Mrs Weasley has when she kills Bellatrix .....but no instead we have stone figures battling giants all because that looks better in 3d.The only praise I will give is to Alan Rickman as Snape a real hero of the book reduced to a 5 minute run through of his thoughts that reveals the bravery and love snape locked inside himself. I would have liked to see this extended and cut out the stupid heaven scene. I've never been so disappointed by an ending to a series, I cannot think what was going through David Yates mind when he decided to leave out most of the fighting and use lots of slow mo shots with strange music - urgh it was just awful. The first six films were very entertaining but its all gone wrong at the final hurdle, what a huge shame, it could have been up there with the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies as legend but thanks to the studios deciding to split the end into a 4 hour+ borefest and David Yates suddenly deciding to dismiss all of the other characters like Tonks and Lupin I will never be able to watch the Harry Potters anymore - there is no point as I just couldn't sit though the last 2 parts again.",Null,3,4,26 July 2011
Heat," Just Great
","Trying not to be over the top I watched Heat last night for the first time in a while and when it finished with Al Pacino taking De Niro's dying hand and looking out into the shimmering airfield I was filling up.. the touching and euphoric music swells as Pacino's sad expression gazes out into the night...weird eh? A supposed crime tale of a crook and a cop both sublime in their daily jobs at the expense of family life should not make me feel all emotional at its climax. Heat though manages, in its sprawling run time, to bed in the characters and if you have the patience (as it is quite talky and has a lot of characters) you will be rewarded with a monumental shoot out on the streets of LA and a tense finale which like I said left me at least feeling melancholy. I won't go into details about the story as it has a few plot lines that all come together but I must mention the style and the photography of the film. Some of the scenery and the locations are just stunning and beautiful and really set to mood and the focus on the loneliness of the De Niro and Pacino characters. How can I do an opinion of this film without mentioning its star names? Al Pacino : Godfathers, Scarface, Serpico, Carlitos Way, Gigli (only kidding) and De Niro : Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas ... the list could be much longer. Putting these two together in a film for the first time could have been a lazy poster line for a lazy film but Michael Mann provides an equally interesting and visually stunning story to equal their talents and the result is a feast for fans of their movies. Its a really absorbing story with great actors, a great director and big thumbs up to everyone involved. I highly recommend it.",Null,0,1,23 October 2011
Braveheart," Majestic & Entertaining and a bit annoying
","I consider myself a big film fan. When a friend recently pointed out that it was a crime that i had not seen this movie, despite it being 15 years old, I bought it cheap and decided it was time to see what i had missed out on. First of all this movie has all the elements of an epic. Grand scenery, the great hero, a doomed romance, evil bad guys, a wonderful score and it was about as entertaining as it gets. So why isn't it a 10? Well first of all at times it is a little one dimensional the Scottish are brave heroes and the English are evil spineless bimbos to the last man, the inclusion of the homosexual prince for no reason other than for Mel to have his little fantasy and to shag the princess! What went through the writers mind to put that in? He would have stunk. At that point I felt it bordered on plain stupid. I'm no historian but even I know that was a load of b0llocks. So yes it was entertaining but re writing history to such a degree left me annoyed enough to mark it down.",5,2,5,2 March 2010
