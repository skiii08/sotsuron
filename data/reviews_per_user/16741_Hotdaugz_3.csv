It," IT.
","IT can be disappointing for many movie watchers who loved the original. It is hard to please a large audience of previous fans, due to nostalgia and the original being beloved by many. The film also disappoints horror movie fans who are used to more high-depth scares. Before seeing the new IT movie, I watched the original movie to ensure that it was fresh in my mind. I do believe the new movie has improved on the original movie. The original movie, leaves viewers wondering, how horrific were IT's actions towards the children he planned on consuming? For eg. The sewer scene is much more graphic in the new movie, and showed exactly what viewers in the original film would have imagined to have happened, unlike the original which just fades out. IT with in the original movie, was a lot more creepy.. towards the children and seemed a lot more stalkerish, making him seem like a cannibal. The new IT seems a lot more interested in scaring the children, so he can feed off their fear, which is what is supposed to be his intention. (Both movies have a different approach).I really loved the world that the movie was situated in, it reminded me of movies such as: The Goonies, Stand By Me and Stranger Things (All which I love). I really love films that bring you back to your childhood and allow you to relate to how easier life was back when you were a child. All the young actors were amazing!I believe that if you are to watch this movie, do not go into it with a horror mindset, although it is a horror, it is not that scary. It almost feels like a children's Horror movie. But I love this movie, as the world they are in and the characters have so much 'character' to them, they are all quirky in their own little way. Some of the CGI Scenes are a bit disappointing. For eg. The scene in which the woman comes out of the picture, was unnecessary for me, but was a tribute to the movie Mama.. but just felt out of place for me. But overall I loved the CGI in the Sewer scene and the CGI did not put me off. I really hope they improve on the horror aspect in Part 2 though, and I believe they can as it will not be revolved around children, and there is a lot of stigma about what you can portray on camera when using child actors, as there can be a lot of back lash if something is too extreme for the audience that is watching.One thing I will say is that I wish there was more character build up for Georgie as it would be a lot more emotional, to watch the sewer scene and shocking, if you were more attached to Georgie, you'd feel more for Georgie being swept away into the sewer. Although I believe this would have been an added benefit, I also believe that this could have made the movie too long and also could be unappreciated as it is also great that the movie gets into the story right away.Overall I found this movie to be mildly scary, but if I was not to consider any genre for this movie, I would not mind. I believe this movie is enjoyable without being scary in my opinion. I believe that for viewers who do not typically enjoy horror movies, this could be one to watch to ease into the horror genre!",10,0,1,31 May 2019
Bird Box," A thrilling journey, with a happy ending? (Watch and find out!)
","This movie does not take it's time to kick off! It gets straight into the action from the beginning, which I liked. I saw the trailer and was only half way through and just had to start watching before finishing the trailer, because it grasped my attention enough, to not want any spoilers. The performance from Sandra Bullock was what captures you to watch the movie, she expresses the emotion of fear to a high degree. I could really picture myself in the environment within the movie also. If this movie were ever to be a reality, it would be a world not worth living in, so for me, this movie scares me. This movie really gives you that, 'edge of my seat experience' and *SPOILER* I don't know why, but the concept that the characters had to look at the 'entity' or whatever it was, in the air.. that put them in a suicidal trance, was enough for me to hide behind my pillow at the moments that any light was close to their eyes within the movie. I really found the movie captured my attention, I actually had to pause the movie in the middle because I don't know why, but the thought of a world, where I was unable to see in fear of becoming possessed by something I couldn't explain, is apparently a new fear of mine. This is the only movie that has affected me for a while this way, I never get scared while watching movies and I have seen end of world movies such as World War Z for example.I'm glad the movie does not have a visible entity in which you can visualise what it is that was controlling people to commit suicidal acts. This for me, allows the viewer to visualise and question, what is it that could be so terrifying to make someone go that insane? Some people may be disappointed by this. But I personally believe that if they were to put a face to whatever it was, then I believe that viewers would also be disappointed.",10,20,57,22 December 2018
Aladdin," A WHOLE NEW WORLD.. (Hahaha, I know, CRINGE but it's just the title).
","I had low expectations for this movie, due to the backlash that a lot of social media users had on the trailer for the movie. (Especially on Will Smith, who plays the genie in this movie... if you didn't know that already, because you've been living under a cave). I experience the movie in 4DX 3D, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie was stunning! I couldn't have imagined the live action any other way and I believe it is one of the best live action Disney movies that they have produced. Naomi Scott was a great choice for playing Princess Jasmine, she could really see the passion she had, while playing the role of Jasmine throughout this movie, and without her, the movie wouldn't be as great! Her vocals were stunning! She was the best singer, out of everyone within this movie. Will Smith, was also a better genie than I expected! A lot of fans will never prefer him to the beloved Robin Williams, who played the original Genie in the animation (RIP, Will always be a beloved actor by many). But for the live action, I thought he was an excellent choice! Marwan Kenzari plays the role of Jafar to a really high standard, and portrays his sinister side extremely well! The cast were brilliant throughout the movie, and helped to create the colourful, eccentric, thrilling world of this Disney tale!",10,4,13,22 May 2019
