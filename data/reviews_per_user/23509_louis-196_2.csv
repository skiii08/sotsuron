Skyfall," Instantly forgettable
","Saw it last night and by this morning had pretty much forgotten all about it. Says it all really. Wanton destruction of the DB5 most 'un'cool. Had the feeling I had sat through 3 distinct films before the last 30 minutes which had some redeeming qualities. Daniel Craig looks too old and worn out - I felt knackered just watching him. Actually, he made Judi Dench look positively youthful. I keep on saying never say never again and not see the next movie but I have low will-power. I think this one may have finally pushed me over the edge. Part of the problem may be that Sam Mendez tried to make a 'real' James Bond 'drama' but because it straddled the need to titillate though gratuitous sex and violence and at the same time stimulate intellectually it was neither one nor the other. I wouldn't necessarily avoid but if you don't bother watching this until you can see it for free on TV you will not have wasted your time waiting.",1,8,18,23 February 2013
Tropic Thunder," ....and the real star of the film
","I watched this film for only the first time since seeing it in the cinema on TV the other day and had to say I roared with laughter at various points. It is a very clever comedy although it may be a tad too clever for some. Really great to see Nick Nolte (a much underrated actor) on the screen in an ideal part. Shame that Steve Coogan could not have been used longer or better. But for the real star of the film has to be Tom Cruise. Cruise is such a good actor, not that you'd guess that from the parts he has played recently. I really think he should have got a best supporting actor nomination for his portrayal of a cut-throat Hollywood mogul. Worth hunting out the short scene available on YouTube where he deals with 'Yellow Dawn'. If you don't hurt yourself laughing you haven't got a sense of humour. Highly recommended even if you have to rent for an evening.",8,0,1,23 February 2013
