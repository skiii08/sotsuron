The King's Speech," Bertie and Lional make a great team
","This movie deals humorously and honestly with the personal struggle of a man who takes over as King at a critical time in British history and goes on to rule the country during the second great war of the twentieth century. The King is George VI and his struggle is against his own inadequacy which results in a serious speech impediment, a stutter - a rather awkward defect in a member of the Royal Family, even more so as it becomes apparent that he will become the new monarch. It is hard to imagine anyone performing the role of monarch under such a condition; however, with the help of a dedicated and tough speech therapist, Lional Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, George VI, played by Colin Firth, is able to carry out his role and in fact, perform it superbly. The interaction between the two main characters is what gives this movie its dramatic impact. These two unlikely human beings are brought together by a challenge that will test them and summon up their utmost strength of purpose in pursuit of their goal, which is to give the King his voice and to lead his subjects at a time of a great national crisis. The dialogue is funny, witty, and often confrontational but through it all, a great friendship is created. The King is ably supported by his wife, the Duchess of York and later the Queen, performed by Helena Bonham Carter. She conveys the combination of regal bearing and common touch that made her character so popular with the British people. Michael Gambon is excellent as George V. Claire Bloom's talent is generally wasted in the role of Queen Mary. Her role gave her character no scope, unusual for the woman who was at the heart of the family. She is made up in way that she neither looks like herself or Queen Mary. Both David (Guy Pearce), who becomes Edward VIII, and the object of his devotion, Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), are portrayed as the fun-loving but irresponsible couple that history has come to view them. Derek Jacobi excels as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang. Anthony Andrews has a small but effective role as Stanley Baldwin, the prime minister. All in all, a fine movie with a great story of how the second son stepped up and became a great national symbol when history commanded him.",8,0,0,4 February 2011
Vertigo," Vertigo, a powerful and beautiful movie
","A double identity thriller to surpass all others, Vertigo draws viewers into the mind of one man and his obsession with the beautiful woman he is hired to follow. The plot: A detective named Scotty (James Stewart) is asked by a former college buddy to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who he says is possessed by a personage from the past.
Scotty accepts the job with misgivings but he soon becomes as much a voyeur as a detective, as he falls madly in love.To Scotty, Madeleine is a beautiful and mysterious woman. She captivates him to the point where I had trouble distinguishing between reality and dreams. Vertigo plays with your mind that way because it is brilliantly crafted. While recovering from a serious fall brought on by vertigo, Scotty is longing for a change from his girlfriend and anchor Midge, played by Barbara Bel Geddes.
As Madeleine, Kim Novak never looked better. Madeleine's double Judy has speech and mannerisms quite different from Madeleine but Scotty tries to shape her into the image of Madeleine and comes very close to success. We want him to make it work but I mage vs. reality can lead into dangerous territory, as we find out.
The visuals of this movie are stunning from the opening credits, to the flashback scenes, to tours by car of San Francisco. The riveting female presence of Madeleine in the movie is captured early by close-ups as she passes by the camera. The viewer is drawn into Scotty's obsession and can feel the power of Madeleine's magnetism, when the camera closes in on her. How Hitchcock achieves this is one of the hallmarks of this powerful movie.
The vertigo is shown by a series of shots from high above ground level which gives us a sense of Scotty's harrowing fear of heights. When Scotty is hired to follow Madeleine, we tour San Francisco in a slow-moving vehicle up and down hills, past great public edifices and apartments. The film highlights the white plaster buildings set amid the greenery of the city and the blue and green colour of San Francisco Bay.
The music by Bernard Hermann is perfect, although there were parts in the movie where the orchestral music became jarring. This is a small point given the style, the beauty, and the story line of this mesmerizing movie. I don't think younger audiences are familiar with this movie, certainly one of Hitchcock's one or two best.",10,2,6,2 March 2009
Changeling," Great story, interesting historical setting
","The Changeling, directed by Clint Eastwood, is a very well produced movie that focuses on a supposedly true event in Los Angeles,1928. Angelina Jolie does an excellent job as the mother of an abducted child, who goes through a gruelling effort to find out the truth as to what happened. In the attempt to get justice, she has to fight the City and the police force. The movie portrays the period with sets that give us a look at the times. We see the craftsman bungalows in her neighbourhood, the streetcars, the switchboard operators she supervises so the viewer gets a visual treat of the period as well as the story with its multi-layered plot. One can sense the frustration and heartbreak she encounters with the authorities as she tries to penetrate the corruption and cover-up from people protecting their own vice and evil-doing. The acting is good among a cross section of characters. The sets might be criticized for being too perfect and highly sanitized but this is a small complaint, given the positives of the movie. On another note, some of the cruelty in the film may not be to everyone's liking. It is certainly felt by the audience, although not altogether graphic. In any case, I did like the movie which is fairly long but riveting from start to finish. Recommend.",8,2,3,17 August 2015
Lifeboat," Survivors fight for their lives on board a lifeboat
","The strength of Lifeboat is the very interesting mix of characters who survive the torpedo sinking of their American-British ship by a German u-boat. The movie is described as a propaganda film, shot in 1944 during World War II, and the character of the German boat captain (played by Walter Slezak) gives it that focus; however, it was a pleasure viewing a movie that serves up such a diverse group performed so well by a great cast, Wm. Bendix, John Hodiak, Tallulah Bankhead, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee, Mary Anderson, Henry Hull, Heather Angel and Walter Slezak as the German. They all share a lifeboat and the German captain remains something of a mystery for much of the movie. With his marine experience, they hope he can help them. I found that Wm. Bendix gave a fine performance and his role proves to be pivotal. Tallulah Bankhead was outstanding as the journalist who shows her detachment from a crisis that has others trembling. In her high heels and well-coiffed hair, her character is not really credible but the air of being above the tragic event reinforces her steely character. She is also a realist and knows the German can help and persuades the others not to abandon him. She also shows a large measure of compassion when misfortune strikes. And she is not above showing passion for John Hodiak, a man who she actually loathes, except for her physical attraction to him. Hodiak's character is high strung, commanding and hateful towards the German. He does not hesitate to try to take control when the chance arises. The fact that he appears shirtless reinforces the macho image. It is an image that attracts and repels the female lead, played by Tallulah Bankhead. Canada Lee is the strong, silent character who adds spiritual solace at critical moments. His fine voice and stature are well suited to the character. Hume Cronyn and Mary Anderson are appealing characters, best described as team players; they also become a couple on the lifeboat. A great effort by director Alfred Hitchcock, it was a departure from his usual thrillers but showed his ability to handle another movie genre. I noticed John Steinbeck's name on the opening frame. One of the great American novelists, the strength of the characterization was likely due to his contribution; however, Steinbeck's disappointment with the movie led to a request to remove his name from the credits. I am glad to see that his name did appear anyway. To my mind, this has the feel of one of his works.",8,0,0,24 August 2014
42," Story of the man who broke through baseball's colour barrier
","42 is a movie about one of the most important stories in professional baseball, the breaking of the racial barrier with the first black baseball player. Chapman Bosemann is an incredible lookalike for Jackie Robinson, third baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but his real strength is portraying the character of the man who sucked up his guts and persevered through the harassment, hate letters, and racial epithets that targeted him and aimed to break his spirit. We also get a view of his fellow team players who learnt to accept him and stand by him in his struggle. It was not unanimous. Some were reluctant; the great shortstop Pee Wee Reese, for example, who later became a great ally. Owner Branch Rickey, a religious man and a man with a strong social conscience, made it clear that he wanted total cooperation or the players would be bounced from the team. Rickey is played by actor Harrison Ford, who was so well made up to look like Rickey that it never struck me who really was the man under the mop of hair, professorial spectacles, bow tie and three piece suit. Christopher Meloni plays coach Leo Durocher, a man of steel who was relieved when Rickey assured him, that Robinson was not a nice guy. 'Nice guys finish last', he said, repeating his now famous line. I heard about the difficulties Robinson had to face in his mission to be 'the first black man in baseball.' However, I had no idea of the racism and resentment he had to endure. It was an outstanding story and is well presented in this fine piece of movie making.",Null,1,1,16 December 2014
12 Angry Men," Anger among the jury results in justice
","This classic movie has an excellent cast of well-known actors in a story that goes to the heart of the justice system. From the beginning, it is apparent that the young man on trial for a murder is saddled with a jury that is totally unfit to pass judgement on whether he should live or die. Very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process; they were impulsive, lacking in compassion, ignorant of the law, and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves,except for two or three. This wedge enabled Henry Fonda, the lone dissenting voice at the start, to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty. During the process of passing judgement, the jury is subject to an intense self-examination of their own prejudices and opinions.As the movie goes along, the viewer is appalled at the mentality of the group, with no understanding of the scope of their responsibility. The foreman, Martin Balsam, takes his job very routinely and would have easily allowed the jury to pass judgement without any reflection. The movie was very effective in showing the men sweat and fly off the handle in the midst of a New York heatwave that made them eager to get away from the courtroom. At one point, one of the last holdouts, E.G. Marshall, playing an unemotional and stone-faced juror, was forced to wipe his brow under a barrage of questioning from Henry Fonda that exposed the falsehood of his assumptions. We see similar cutaways to Lee J. Cobb, who eventually loses his grip as others take the opposite side in the argument.This is a tense and unvarnished look at human beings thrown together in a jury and it shows the forces at play that would deny that justice be done. I am sure that this movie and others gave rise to some of the changes to the American justice system over the last 60 years to prevent the miscarriages of justice that probably occurred in many cases. A great movie and a lesson in the due process of law.",8,0,0,16 January 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Great entertainment pokes fun at relationships
","Crazy, Stupid Love is one very funny romantic comedy that pokes fun at the dating lifestyle and longtime marriages. Sub-plots involving teenage love and jilted lovers create a tangle of funny complications. While the plot is contrived, the entertainment kept me laughing. Julianne Moore, Steve Carrell, and Ryan Gosling delivered in their roles as well as Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon who get caught up in the family conflict. Steve Carell, as Cal, was the husband who reacted with the cold, silent treatment when his wife and lifelong love, Emily (Julianne Moore), asked for a divorce. He then embarked on a freewheeling lifestyle with advice from Jacob, self-proclaimed dating expert, played by Ryan Gosling. Marital problems lead to outside love interests that overlap families, neighbors and work associates. The middle of the movie sagged a bit but was redeemed by some very funny scenes. All in all, a family situation fraught with a maze of hilarious complications.",7,0,1,28 October 2014
The Notebook," Lifelong love a powerful symbol of good
","Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this romantic film about a love that lasts a lifetime, crossing a huge divide between two families. From the very start, Ryan Gosling, who plays the role of Noah, falls head over heels for the girl who becomes the love of his life, Allie, played by Rachel McAdams. The two go their separate ways when their summer love affair comes to an end, with the intervention of her parents, who are unable to accept the fact that their daughter has fallen for someone who only earns 40 cents an hour in a lumber job, at the dawn of World War II. The broken-down house that Noah dreams of building into a home becomes a driving force and with some help from his father, Sam Shepherd, and a lot of work, the dream becomes a reality. The ever-competent Joan Allen, Allie's mother, hides the letters that Noah writes while he is overseas during the war, effectively snuffing out the romance, but only for a while. They reconnect seven years later and find themselves drawn again to each other. Despite her engagement to a man she cares deeply for, Allie finds herself in a bind and is forced to decide between the two. Her mother confesses to a similar relationship that she was involved in and abandoned her first love for a secure future but she does return the hidden letters. In a parallel story, an older couple played by two veteran actors - James Garner and Gena Rowlands, whose talents shines in this film, show the tenacity of their love as they reach old age. As an aside, the director of the movie is Nick Cassevetes, son of Gena Rowlands and John Cassevetes. He has made a very beautiful and sentimental movie that shows the power of true love. As with many love affairs, adversity makes the bond of love even stronger. A great love story is always a powerful symbol of good in our universe.",6,0,1,22 October 2010
Brokeback Mountain," Powerful movie of same sex love
","Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall give outstanding performances in this movie about same sex love that goes far beyond much of the rhetoric we hear on the subject. The movie is a story about two human beings who struggle with themselves, their families and the misunderstandings and prejudices of people in their lives. Both Gyllenhall and Ledger shined but I found Ledger's performance more moving because he was in denial about his own nature and continued to put his family before himself throughout the story, causing great personal and mental anguish. At the end he was less withdrawn and came to realize how much Gyllenhall's character meant to him. The dynamics with both families were typical of family conflict aggravated by their secret lives. Ledger and his daughters had a special bond that plays so well in the movie. It was also very interesting that both these men had mastered the alpha male persona that fit in with their frontier environments. Gyllenhall was willing to take risks about approaching other men but Ledger was incapable of acting on his instincts, with the exception of his liaison with Gyllenhall. It was also interesting to see how they handled the romantic interests of females. A truly extraordinary movie, it is a powerful story with a final scene that you will not forget.",9,1,2,11 March 2015
Spotlight," Spotlight on the Church
","I just watched this movie for the first time concerning a massive cover-up of pedophile priests by the Catholic Church in Boston. I liked the investigative team that went after the story, actors Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams. Ruffalo and McAdams showed the instincts and spunk of true reporters. Once they smelled a rat, they pursued the story relentlessly getting the facts needed to make public aware of the cover-up that kept pedophiles from answering for their crimes. Keaton was the boss who had to ensure the hard evidence was secured to give credibility to the story. Michael Keaton is compelling as the guy who grew up in Boston, attended Boston College and became one of the boys on the golf course hobnobbing with lawyers and journalists. But he knew things were not right in the way his hometown and its dominant religious body was dealing with a grave injustice that was wrecking the lives of many young people. We get the sense of life in Boston with its love of sports and homespun camaraderie, something of a foil to deflect crimes lurking on its own dark side. The new kid on the block, Liev Screiber, is the one who unleashes the hounds as he tries to break through the easygoing veneer of official Boston, particularly its clergy and its lawyers. He shows the uneasiness of a man who doesn't quite fit in but gives his team the support they need to get the story out. A fine movie with great acting from the above as well as Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Jamie Sheridan. This is a movie that reminds people that institutions have to account for injustice and cover-ups aimed at protecting their sacred turf.",8,2,3,9 February 2017
Match Point," Woody Allen's film noir
","It surprises me that this movie has not received more attention because it is a major departure for Woody Allen's career as a director and a very dark and brooding film that has more in common with Double Indemnity or The Postman Always Rings Twice. It is not a comedy but it does borrow on some of the themes in Allen's previous movies, particularly Crimes and Misdemeanors. It also deals with London's version of the artistic crowd he casually mocks in his New York movies of the 1980's. The climax is one that could have appeared in a film noir of the 1940's.The dialogue is witty and the cast is excellent with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johanssen in the leading roles as two newcomers to London society whose paths converge, then change and finally come together again leading to a bizarre twist of fate at the end. Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer as brother and sister are both excellent and round out the leading players. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are Mr and Mrs Hewett, the society couple who bring Rhys-Meyers into the family firm.I found the lives of the family that Rhyss-Meyers married into somewhat shallow and this was no doubt Woody Allen's intent, reflecting his distaste for families with social status. Rhyss-Meyers finds it 'boring' as he puts it, and seeks out an unconventional girl from Boulder, Colorado for some excitement and falls madly in love with her. He cannot bring himself to abandon the perks that come as a member of his new family and this leads to rather grim consequences with one person finding unusual good luck.",8,2,3,17 January 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," The challenge of post-war life
","It is hard to sum up a movie with as much character, human interest and compassion as this one, which deals with the transition from war to peace by three men who return home to their loved ones and their former lives after World War II. Sometimes called the 'greatest generation', the men and women in the movie are a sampling of that demographic who are now passing into history. This movie leaves you with a great sense of satisfaction, not laughs or escapism but takes life as it was for many families and handles it with honesty and intelligence.To start with, the main character performed by Frederick March tries to balance his conscience and responsibilities in a time when change meant moral dilemmas that were not easy to resolve, whether in personal or professional lives. His steadfast wife is Myrna Loy, who is understanding and sometimes critical but fully engaged in his life.All three men in this movie and their loved ones were faced with challenges. In each case, they forced themselves or one another to face up to the task. These involved physical disability, personal relationships, unemployment, and making the transition from the battlefield to the workplace.This movie has humour and fun as well as serious issues. Frederick March's character sets the tone. He doesn't moralize or patronize. He plunges into the fray...advising, chastising, getting angry, laughing or boozing. The other men respect him and he helps bring out the best in them. Dana Andrews, as the war hero whose return to civilian and personal life was almost humiliating, was excellent in his role as was Harold Russell (a non-professional actor) who went from big man in town to double amputee. Theresa Wright and Cathy O'Donnell played the women who salvaged their self-esteem.When all is said and done, these are flawed but good men whose courage is never in doubt. They had the good fortune to find strong women to lean on. With their courage and determination, they are able to move on in their lives, however changed it might be. To me this will always be a great movie. Despite changed times, the movie still has much to say.",9,0,0,30 May 2010
Shutter Island," A story that grips and fills the viewer with doubt
","Martin Scorsese has delivered a controversial piece of dark filmmaking with the movie Shutter Island, set in Boston Harbour during the 1950's. The film holds the viewers in its grip with Leonardio DiCaprio playing a federal marshall with his subordinate Mark Ruffalo, who are investigating the disappearance of a patient (prisoner) on the island, a horrible place of infamy contrasting with its beautiful green landscape. It becomes clear that the condescending and smooth doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow are conducting experiments in eugenics, something he has despised ever since his wartime experience with the Nazis. Or so it seems. Then a series of traumas and flashbacks into his personal life cast doubt on the whole plot. We witness a series of exploits, family related tragedies, a cliffhanging on Shutter Island and a visit with a mysterious woman in a cave. The trauma of a troubled man on a mission casts a heavy doubt on the entire plot and his own personal sanity. A movie well worth seeing.",8,0,1,18 September 2016
Rush," Intense Rivalry on the Racetrack
","This movie about the intense rivalry and hostility between car racing champs Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) has the feel of a movie and documentary. The two personalities are a contrast between the disciplined, serious Lauda and the partying, fun-loving Hunt. The film-making was spectacular as it showed the view behind the wheel as cars race at terrifying speed. In one event, won by a Hunt, Lauda literally crashed and burned, resulting in serious lung damage and permanent scarring. (Lauda opposed holding the event because of the poor race conditions but entered against his better judgement.) Later, he returned to show his unyielding drive as he continued to compete and win. Both became world champions and beat one another in fiercely contested races. What stays with the viewer is the image of two highly driven young men whose rivalry brings out the best in each other as they mature and come to respect one another. They are not only great racing drivers but become men of character. Once again, director Ron Howard has created a movie that speaks to the heart with this great addition to his many directing achievements.",8,0,0,11 December 2015
North by Northwest," One of Hitch's Best
","Coming in the midst of Hitchcock's most productive and highly rated period as a director, this movie is definitely one of his best. To me, it is one of the most entertaining films I've ever watched. It is a double identity thriller involving a New York ad executive, played by Cary Grant, whose routine suddenly falls apart when he is suddenly thrust into the role of a decoy in an international game of espionage. His female counterpart is a secret agent played by Eva Marie Saint, who meets up with him on a train to Chicago. The movie is stylish, with a well written dialogue, stunning photography, humour and suspense. It has the picture postcard look of the 1950's in a series of settings that take the viewer from New York's United Nations and Grand Central Terminal to the Mid-Western cornfields and finally to Mount Rushmore in North Dakota. Leo G. Carroll is the mastermind of the espionage game that pits him against James Mason on the other side, although the two never meet. Mason's henchmen are led by Martin Landau, the star of Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemenors 30+years later. The one flaw that I saw was that Grant was far older than the character he played; however, Grant's stellar performance and iconic presence is memorable. Always a joy to watch, viewers are treated to the witty dialogue and funny scenes that keep coming throughout the movie, not to mention the scintillating repartee among the main characters.",9,0,0,23 March 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," Court drama in postwar Germany
","Directed by Stanley Kramer, this movie is the story of a great courtroom drama involving judges of Nazi Germany. The judges, including a great jurist who became the Minister of Justice, administered laws aimed at imposing racial purity and mandatory sterilization. Human beings were treated as pawns in the hands of these men in the name of the Nazi state. The presiding judge, played superbly by Spencer Tracey, is a model of integrity. In the role of the former minister of justice is Burt Lancaster, a cut above the other small-minded tyrants who had no conscience in carrying out their cruel sentences to produce the master race. Despite his character and his great legal mind, he too was complicit in the tragedy. In fact, his sharp sense of revulsion about these crimes, made him even more repellant as he went against his own conscience and training. The other cast members include Maximilian Schell as the defence attorney, Richard Widmark as the prosecuting attorney, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift as key witnesses as well as victims, and Marlene Dietrich as the widow of wartime criminal already executed. All the cast are outstanding. While the story is overly long, we get a strong sense of the characters and how Tracey as a judge lived and mingled with the people of Nuremberg during his time in the occupied post-war country. The director, Stanley Kramer, made movies that showed people of conscience in conflict with the established order. He made use of great acting talents like Burt Lancaster and Spencer Tracey to issue strong statements of principle. This movie is a prime example of his great legacy as a director.",9,1,2,12 August 2016
Dunkirk," Tense and riveting work of film-making
","Dunkirk is a tense, riveting piece of film-making. The action moves from beach to sea to sky with the story showing how the event was played out among all involved in this historic event. I felt like I was inside the Spitfire as it raced across the sky, or drowning inside a boat as it was bombed and burned. The scene looking across the English Channel was dark and cold and the waters rough. While there was great heroism, the viewer also sees the worst as men suffering from shock come face to face with critical choices. The cast was made up of many fine performers but I found Mark Rylance was best as he portrayed the quiet heroism of Mr. Dawson, who along with his two sons, volunteered his small craft for the evacuation. The movie seems to point out that people like him were the backbone of the massive evacuation effort. A vivid movie spectacular, this movie made me feel like I was right there in the water, on the beach or in the air. A truly great movie!",9,4,10,27 July 2017
Jackie," A behind the scenes look at a great moment in American history
","I recently caught the movie Jackie on Netflix and couldn't take my eyes off the TV screen as it moved from a series of post-assassination interviews to the events that lasted from a Friday to Monday back in November 1963. It took me back to those days as a 15 year old and showed what could have happened behind the scenes as the assassination of President Kennedy and its aftermath unfolded on our television sets. Nicole Portman as Jackie, the President's wife, is totally believable as a woman overcome with the emotion of a sudden family tragedy who planned and executed a nationally televised wake and funeral. She managed to get what she wanted--a funeral where she, JFK's brothers and a hundred heads of state walked in a procession; a suitable location for a grave site; a role for herself and her orphaned children; and a funeral template used a hundred years earlier for Abraham Lincoln. I was impressed with how the movie showed a young woman of 34 who was able to immortalize, against all odds, her love for her 46-year old husband and do justice to the office he held. The solemn and dignified woman we saw on television at the time was going through a living hell in private and we see this in one powerful performance. John Hurt as the elderly and wise priest, who counselled Jackie in her darkest moments was splendid. (The only cleric I had ever associated with the Kennedy assassination was Boston's Cardinal Cushing.) I was impressed with the performance of Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy, the President's confidante and brother, who comforted, restrained and supported Jackie while his own world lay in ruins. Caspar Phillipson seemed a good double for John Kennedy in a short but key role. I was disappointed John Carroll Lynch wasn't given more scope. His performance as Lyndon Johnson didn't show the softer side of this formidable president. Beth Grant as Lady Bird Johnson, a great First Lady, also seemed rather stern. Max Casella as Jack Valenti was Lyndon Johnson's pit bull toward the Kennedys. Billy Crudup as the journalist who wrote Jackie's story for Life Magazine was forceful but fair as he occasionally sparred with Jackie over the story she wanted and which she would carefully control for her public image. At the end, as he loosened up, he admitted the funeral was a great spectacle. This movie adds to our appreciation of that great spectacle.",Null,1,2,5 August 2017
No Country for Old Men," Dark Masterpiece
","Joel and Ethan Coen have made something of a dark masterpiece in this movie, shot in the American southwest with desert landscapes and one-on-one encounters that are grim, chilling and sometimes strangely amusing. The time is 1978 and two of the characters are Vietnam veterans. The acting is outstanding, particularly Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Woody Harrelson is a droll and cynical investigator in a supporting role. The directors use pauses, muted soundtracks, silent gunshots and chase scenes, often shot in darkness inside and out. Tommy Lee Jones, the sheriff, is the most stable character and the man most aware of his own faults and the evils he sees in the world. Times are changing with crime more widespread and he takes solace in the past. Kelly MacDonald is outstanding as the wife of Josh Brolin. A downbeat but utterly fascinating movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.",9,2,3,6 June 2014
JFK," Ongoing Grief Over John F. Kennedy
","Combining a conspiracy theory of the Kennedy assassination with real film footage and stellar cast, Oliver Stone has fashioned a highly entertaining movie in JFK. In his overall work, Stone has drawn on events from American history that are touchstones for the post-1945 generation and this is certainly one, as was apparent in the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination in 2013. Theuse of the Zapruder film and other film recordings are part of the retelling of this event and have long contributed to the public's unease over the conclusions of the Warren Commission Report that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of the President. So once again, the visual evidence forms part of the movie. The cast is excellent in a drama that gives a fictionalized account of what happened to JFK. Whether or not it represents historical truth is not the point of the movie. Stone is telling a story that shows a certain point of view to an audience that lived through the assassination and craves for some meaning in a tragic event.The idea that the CIA, the Pentagon, Lyndon Johnson, and a group of conspirators based in New Orleans managed to change the course of history will catch the attention of Americans who remember the event because it was so traumatic. Oliver Stone's success in levering the events of his time into entertainment is his stock in trade and no more on display than here. The acting of Joe Pesci as David Ferrie and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw were particularly notable, not to mention the mystery man played by Donald Sutherland. The behind the scenes stories of characters associated with the story lures us into the ongoing temptation of wanting to believe that there is an explanation to bring closure to a loss that haunts many of us, not just Americans. Stone's movie brings it all back and again stirs up the doubts that linger in the public's mind.",8,1,8,21 April 2014
Good Will Hunting," Blue-Collar Boston's Diamond in the Rough
","This movie celebrates the unsung hero but beyond that, it challenges us to cast aside stereotypes and see the diamond in the rough. In that sense, it follows the Frank Capra tradition of exalting the forgotten people in our own midst.The main plot is about a young man named Will Hunting who works as a janitor at MIT but in his blue collar world, there is a genius lurking. The sub-plot involving two academic rivals – Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard – is about the struggle between two strong personalities to decide the best way to help Will.Will suffers from a background of being shuffled from one foster home to another and this leads to behavior that regularly lands him in trouble. He is discovered by a professor, Gerald Lambeau, played by Skarsgard, who himself has been honored for outstanding academic achievement. Lambeau seeks out his long-time rival, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to be the youth's therapist – a court-mandated requirement to get Will out of a possible prison sentence and to get him on track to achieve the tremendous success Lambeau feels he is capable of.The rivalry between the two professors takes on tremendous significance for Will's future. Lambeau sees potential waiting to be unleashed and Maguire sees the wounded human soul, who needs to be rescued before he releases him into the world.Will finds love in a young university woman named Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, who clearly sees the broken man with a big heart, who is a latent genius. Skylar is a natural with Will and his friends, despite the fact that they exist in different worlds. When Skylar decides to pursue her dreams in California, she asks Will to go with her. She loves him deeply but because of a deep-seated fear he might be hurt or betrayed, Will cannot bear to leave the world he knows with the friends he trusts. His friends are Chuck Sullivan, (Ben Affleck) Morgan O'Mally, (brother Casey Affleck) and Billy McBride (Cole Hauser).Will's fate is more or less decided at a critical moment in the movie with his therapist and is reinforced by his girlfriend Skylar and his friend Chuckie – both believe in him and care deeply for him. This movie is the result of collaboration between Damon and Affleck. They wrote and produced the movie, drawing on their Boston roots to show the hardscrabble existence of the blue-collar Irish in South Boston (Southie) with poverty and street fighting. The movie is directed by Gus Van Sant, who directed the movie Elephant. The foul language is somewhat jarring but serves to make the movie an accurate portrayal.This movie shows the gap between the blue-collar workers and the university people in the same city but in that setting two strong-willed men try to help a young man from the wrong side of town.",8,2,6,20 October 2008
The Elephant Man," John Merrick's struggle for dignity
","How do we accept people for who they are and overlook appearances. These usually get in the way of how we judge other human beings. In the case of John Merrick, the visual reality was, to be honest, hard to overlook. A severely-disfigured face and body resulted in sneers, taunts and cruelty from 'normal' people. It speaks volumes for director David Lynch that he took on the task of making this film, which he handles with great sensitivity.John Merrick was a man of keen intelligence and sensitivity, as Dr. Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) was to learn. Anthony Hopkins is excellent in the character of Treves, the polar opposite of Hannibal Lecter. Treves initially dismisses him as an idiot but soon finds out that nothing could be further from the truth. Merrick shows his intelligence when he spontaneously recites the 23rd psalm. If this is true to life, it is incredible that Merrick, portrayed by John Hurt, did not carry a burden of bitterness and sadness. He was forced to go out into the public with a hood covering his head, which had grown to grotesque proportions over his short lifetime. It speaks volumes for the men and women who took him in, gave him shelter and tried to restore dignity to his battered psyche. Beneath the exterior was an extraordinary man, who drew strength from the memory of his mother. This inspirational figure from his past allowed him to survive the cruelties he had to endure, including a stint in a carnival sideshow where he was exhibited to paying customers. The staff of the London hospital where Dr. Treves practiced thought highly of John Merrick and they did everything they could to protect him. The characters from the hospital include Wendy Hiller and John Gielgud, stalwarts of the British stage. There is an interesting cameo by Princess Alex, the Princess of Wales, who intervenes on behalf of Queen Victoria to keep Merrick at the hospital. The princess is played by Helen Ryan in a role she has played in other British dramas. The most heart-warming of all is the role of Mrs. Kendall, played by Anne Bancroft (late wife of producer Mel Brooks), who becomes Merrick's patron and most ardent admirer. Her introduction to John Merrick is a moment of total graciousness towards John Merrick, which we feel that he so deserves. There isn't a hint of the awkwardness from Mrs. Kendal that others display.The harsh industrial background of Victorian London and the plight of the working class who exploit John Merrick are realistically woven into the movie. Interestingly, it is the other sideshow 'freaks' who understand his plight and come to his rescue at a very moving point in the movie. Social realism, for which British cinema and literature are well known, is a hallmark of this movie. But there is also a counterbalancing of hope and kindness that gives this movie its real strength.",8,1,1,12 April 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," Pacino and the1970's setting stand out in this movie classic
","I was delighted to get Dog Day Afternoon as a Christmas gift. I still watch DVDs and thank goodness for them. Other than TCM, there is only a slim chance of viewing this movie on television.
Finally getting to see the movie and its star Al Pacino was a bigger treat than I expected. Watching this robbery/hostage drama made me feel like I was right there minute by minute as the story unfolded. Sidney Lumet, a director of so many great movies set in New York, knew the territory.
The movie is set in 1970s Brooklyn and it captures the squalor and the mood of one New York neighbourhood. At the time, New York was dealing with crime, bankruptcy, racial strife and the loss of faith in government. Pacino, playing Sonny, is an unemployed Italian-American in a failing marriage. Part of the story is an alliance he builds with neighbours who cheer for him as he is surrounded by police, FBI, and media reporters.
John Cazale plays his buddy Sal and Charles Durning is the seasoned police chief caught in a highly charged standoff between the police and the supportive crowd who cheer on the hostage takers. The full cast is great.
Glad I finally saw this movie, which I can now add to the many other great movies I've seen from the 1970's. Highly recommend.",Null,0,1,6 January 2018
Slap Shot," Hockey club antics great fun
","Slapshot from 1977 is one of the best hockey movies ever. It strikes a chord with me because I associate hockey with tremendous skill and excitement as well as respect and community spirit. At heart, Slapshot is about those same values. The storyline is a team's struggle to survive when the closure of a steel mill threatens the existence of the town and its hockey team. The 1970's obsession with goon style hockey offers the players hope that they can use such tactics to save their team and their jobs. The team leader Michael Ontkean and the player-coach Paul Newman are at odds with each other over the strategy. Both have strained relationships with their wives because of hockey. There are Canadian elements with games against Canadian teams and stereotypes of French Canadian hockey players. Paul Newman drinks Canadian Club. The Canuck touches are clearly to draw interest and chuckles from Canadian audiences. I thought the Hanson brothers were great with their thick horn-rimmed glasses and geeky behaviour, who are treated as 'retards' but inspire everyone with their skill and enthusiasm. Other touches are the surprise scene at the end by Michael Ontkean. The plaid clothes and hair rugs herald back to 1970's fashions. The whole thing is totally dated but this snapshot movie from the 1970's is part of its charm.",Null,0,0,19 July 2016
Prisoners," Sombre and eerie masterpiece
","A very sombre and eerie story, the music, dark locations, run-down houses and wounded characters left me with a feeling of foreboding. The apparent kidnapping of two children immediately thrusts two families into a crisis in the middle of their Thanksgiving get-together. The rest of the movie deals with the fallout for families, police, neighbours, suspects, etc. and the suspense is tight enough to grip the audience until the end. The leading characters are played by Hugh Jackman, as Keller Dover, the father of one of the children, and Jake Gyllenhall, as Detective Logi, the man assigned to the case. Dover is a man of strength and ferocity who sees his purpose in life to defend and protect his wife and family from harm. When this particular crisis hits, his one objective is to rescue his daughter unharmed and nothing will stop him, even taking the law into his own hands. This leads to a some horrific scenes with the immediate suspect, a young man with a limited intelligence played by Paul Dano and his mother played by Melissa Leo. Maria Bello plays Dover's wife with Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as the parents of the second child. The detective uses every resource available to try to locate the children. Detective Loki is a low-key but determined police officer who cannot keep Keller Dover from flying into a continuous rage over the time it takes to find the kidnap victims. The final scene and ambiguous ending left a bit of a question mark. The strange sequence of events is a dark look at how people react to one horrific event but it contains elements of heroism. Denis Villeneuve has directed what I consider a brilliant movie.",9,1,2,7 August 2015
Woman in Gold," A Fight to Reclaim Art Stolen by Nazis
","This movie brings together an unlikely cast of Helen Mirren, Ryan Reynolds and Daniel Bruhl in what I found to be a highly satisfying drama, based on a true story concerning a great work of art by painter Gustav Klimt from from early 20th century Venna. I have always admired Helen Mirren's acting and I knew about Klimt from an exhibit at the National Gallery in Ottawa, some 15 years ago. We learn the background through a series of flashbacks that play through Mirren's memory as Maria Altmann, the child of a highly cultured family in Vienna, who were targeted by the Nazis during the occupation of Austria in World War II. She lived through the Nazi reign of terror during which Jewish families were humiliated, their property stolen and eventually they were deported to death camps. (There is one highly-charged chase scene that took place on foot through streets, and dark passages that had me on the edge of my seat.) As an older woman living in Pasadena she becomes acquainted with a young lawyer who is also part of her extended family. Ryan Reynolds as Arnold Schoenberg is at first reluctant to take on a mission to recover a work of art; he is busy starting a career and family, when they meet. However, he becomes engrossed with Maria's sister 'The Woman in Gold', one of Klimt's paintings and soon becomes the catalyst keeping Mirren focused on her goal of getting some justice done. Daniel Bruhl, as a young Austrian journalist trying to erase the stain of Austria's flirtation with the Nazis, is their chief contact in the fight against a few arrogant elitists who seem to have learned nothing from their country's history. All told, it was a great movie--entertaining and tragic both but lightened by touches of humour and an alliance among three different people trying to deal with the evils of the past.",8,1,1,9 September 2016
The Godfather: Part III," Satisfying Finale
","Watching this movie for the first time turned out to be an unexpected treat. The main cast consisted of Michael and Kay--Al Pacino and Diane Keaton returning some 16 years later as a middle aged couple who are now divorced. Keaton has had it with the Corleone family and Michael, now suffering from severe diabetes and heart trouble, wants to wind up his bloody days and make peace with his rivals. Talia Shire, as Michael's sister Connie, has become Michael's personal assistant and care-giver. Eli Wallach performs the role of family elder who encourages Michael to let go of the fighting and gang war bloodshed. Andy Garcia gives a superb performance as Vince, the son of brother Sonny and the heir apparent to the 'family business'. Pacino tries to tame the irascible nephew who has learned the family's criminal behaviour all too well. Michael's own son has abandoned his father's wish for him to become a lawyer in favour of becoming an opera star. This career choice takes the whole family on a trip to Sicily for the son's debut. Michael meets the future pope, whose plans for the Vatican Bank are somewhat at odds with the past. Michael hoped to clean up his image by aligning himself with the Vatican Bank. I like how the Vatican intrigue is woven into the movie along with the death of a pope and the election of the new reform cardinal. The locations in both Italy and America are stunning. I found that Keaton and Pacino made an fitting transition as they become the older generation to the children and their cousins. The opera music and the final location in Italy all contributed to the overall pleasure and effect of this very satisfying movie.",8,0,2,29 June 2013
Psycho," Psycho Superb!
","This is a splendid movie that shows Alfred Hitchcock at the top of his form. This movie came right after North by Northwest, also by Hitchcock, so it has to be one of the best one-two punches by a director in film history. The first half of the movie, dominated by the character of Marion Crane, is to me, the superior part, without any disrespect to the rest of the film. Janet Leigh's controlled performance is so convincing we feel every nerve-wracking moment after that first excruciating misdeed. From the opening scene over the skyline of Phoenix into the hotel room of Marion and Sam, I was drawn into the movie in a way that only a great movie can achieve. Audiences often complain that a movie can seldom measure up to a good book; however, a great movie can do visual tricks and show nuances very effectively in the hands of a great director. This movie is a case in point. The camera zooms into an envelope holding $40,000 or a peephole where Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates, observes Marion undressing. The music is like chalk on a blackboard as the sharp violin strings heighten the nauseating fear that we feel along with Marion. The closeup of the police officer in sunglasses is almost terrifying. The pounding of the rain on the windshield is something almost everyone can feel and in this case, it seems like the world is crowding in on Marion. Scene by scene we go from one vignette to another. Vera Miles, as Marion's sister, and John Gavin, as Marion's lover, give brilliant performances as they try to get to the truth of Marion's disappearance. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Martin Balsam as Abrogast, the private eye. Anthony Perkins gives his career defining role, although he had many great roles. This was the only Hitchcock role for Leigh and Petkins and they made these characters their own. Highly recommend because it shows the great potential of film/making.",9,0,1,21 April 2016
All Quiet on the Western Front," Strong anti-war message in early movie
","All Quiet On the Western Front is an anti-war movie that follows a group of German schoolboys who enlist in World War I without any hint of the dire consequences that lie ahead. They expect to repeat the experience of the previous generation who conquered the French in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. As the war drags on in the disease-plagued trenches of Europe, the youths come face to face with the cruelty of war. Before long, they realize that the bravura of going to war is a total mirage and the war isn't going to be short and sweet. The story shows the reaction on the German side but the onset of war was received in much the same on the British side with people reacting in a frenzy of false hope for a quick victory over the 'Huns', only to come face to face with the reality of a lengthy war. This movie is a very sober view of that war, made 12 years after WW I was concluded. It was awarded an Academy Award for best picture and Lew Ayres was named the best actor.While the dialogue, imagery and acting deliver a strong anti-war message, the script is flat and the movie seems 'staged'. It also shows a great unease among soldiers in battle. The dialogue of the soldiers is unashamedly anti-war. It seems highly unusual that men in battle would allow themselves this luxury with discussions about the merits of war during their timeouts on the battlefield. Can soldiers adopt this mindset and still fight effectively? We even see the leading character, Lew Ayres, nurse and talk to the French soldier he has shot in battle. While this movie conveys the reasons for not waging war, it doesn't take into account the fact that people in the warring countries of Europe were fired by nationalism and the belief that they were acting in their country's interest. Soldiers have to at least rationalize their mission or turn a blind eye to any doubts they might have.  I have never fought in a land war or any other kind of war so I can only surmise how people might react. I can certainly understand that soldiers would come to hate it and never want to see it repeated. The movie was well received in its time and shows the revulsion that many people must have had for the war. The anti-war message clearly resonated with audiences",8,1,1,31 July 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," Small town attorney fights bigotry
","An outstanding movie with Gregory Peck, To Kill a Mockingbird is based on the Harper Lee novel set during the Depression of the 1930's. While it has a strong civil rights message that is the core of the film, it is also a great family story. This comes out early in the film as Jem and Scout, Peck's two children, meet up with Dill, the boy staying next door for the summer. It is a small town where children play and explore the neighbourhood. We see a mad dog that Atticus shoots to spare his family from any attack and a house that the neighbours avoid out of fear of what lies within it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are Scout and Jem, the two children of Atticus Finch. Atticus is a single father and a lawyer whose wife died several years earlier. Atticus spends time with his children and answers their questions in an honest and loving way. When a judge comes by to ask him to take on a case of alleged assault by a black man, Atticus knows he will be taking on a huge burden in a town where blacks are up against bigotry and ignorance. Yet, he agrees right off. No discussion with a judge...just a simple yes to the judge's question. It is clear that the accused black man is innocent but justice for blacks does not come easily with the climate in this town. During the trial, all the black people look down from the balcony above in the segregated courtroom, symbolic of their distance from laws that govern them. At the end of the trial, they all stand in unison when Atticus leaves. Atticus is a great role model for his community, a lawyer and parent who raises his children and fights for justice in his own town. There is a lesson in how to be a good neighbour toward the end that puts an end to a neighbourhood fallacy. This is one very moving and inspiring film and a great achievement for director Robert Mulligan (Up the Down Staircase, Love with a Proper Stranger).",9,0,1,29 January 2015
A Hard Day's Night," Another frenetic day in the life of the Beatles
","This clever, fast-paced movie, made in 1964, came soon after the eruption of Beatlemania and brings to the screen the humour, the hijinks and sheer energy of the group. The music is singable and danceable and the ballads are great for listening. There is no let-up in the action which has no particular story but follows one frenetic day in the life of the early Beatles. There is great comedic talent in Wilfred Brimble, Paul McCartney's grandfather, an eccentric character who has great fun as he goes along for the ride. There are great close-up shots of Paul, John, George and Ringo. We somehow feel that the photographer has a soft side for Ringo, who can go from mournful frown to winning smile. We see the four trying to escape the mad crowds of fawning admirers as they go from train to car and from one stop to another. The action is spontaneous and seems to move seamlessly because of the great camera work.One of my attractions to this movie is that these are the Beatles I first remember but it also reminded me that they would go on to accomplish much more. This was before many of their classic albums, like Rubber Soul, Sergeant Pepper, Abbey Road and the White Album. With each of these advances, there was more and more great music. John Lennon implied how the early period was just fluff and the real creativity came later on. My own view is that their music evolved over time. The early music is one great chapter with several others to follow in the relatively short span that the group was together.",8,2,2,27 September 2009
The Green Mile," Epic Story of Prison Life
","The Green Mile is a great movie, almost epic in length but it never drags. This story of prison life consists of a series of episodes and scenes that are woven together to tell the experience of one man who spent a number of years working with inmates on death row and another man of great physical presence whose heart was larger than life. Some of the most depraved behaviour comes from one of the guards, who is bent on inflicting as much suffering and humiliation as he can get away with. I would point out that it is a movie that deals with the supernatural, so realism is not a factor in assessing the movie. However, we do see human nature at its best and worst. The best examples shine because of the extreme depravity and sadism that we experience. It is not a movie for the faint of heart; it is based on a Stephen King novel. King is not known for shying away from graphic descriptions of violence or what others might describe as 'being in bad taste'. So this movie brings those literary images to the screen. On the other hand, we also witness supernatural scenes but they are not treated as a normal part of the action, as in many modern 'thrillers'. I was tremendously impressed by Tom Hanks' performance but all the cast made a great contribution to the show. It is certainly a great movie, albeit with a confused ending. Despite that, I would gladly view it again.",Null,0,1,14 March 2015
The Reader," Two lives played out in 20th century Berlin
","The Reader is a well acted and nicely filmed movie with scenes that take lawyer Michael Berg back from late 20th century Germany to his teenage years and then as a student in post-war Germany. As a 15 year-old youth, played by David Kross, he develops a relationship with an older, illiterate woman when she finds him very ill one rainy day in an alleyway in Berlin. Aside from a passionate relationship, graphically shown on screen, he also reads to her from some of the great classical novels. This is an unknown territory for the illiterate Hanna, whose world is now open to great writers. Ralph Fiennes is the mature Michael, who is a successful lawyer with a daughter from an earlier marriage. Facing some personal questions about his relationship with his daughter, he revisits his youth in his own memory, coming in contact with Hannah Schmitz, played by Kate Winslett. Hannah ekes out a living collecting fares from streetcar passengers.We later find out that Hanna took a job with a German company Siemens working in a death camp during World War II. There, she routinely selects prisoners for death in the gas chambers. In her trial, which Michael witnessed as a law student, it is clear that she carried out her duties without guilt. To some, this appears as evidence of her complicity in war crimes. To Michael, it must have seemed that she did not fully realize what she was doing. Neither did she know until later the impact of her relationship with Michael, who apparently was haunted by his youthful sexual liaison with Hannah. In the end, Hannah does come to terms with her past and Michael becomes her only contact with the world as he carries out her final wishes. Kate Winslett plays a lonely woman who is drawn to Michael, a talented language student. As an older, broken woman, she shows the effects of her tortured life journey. Her story makes the viewer feel a strange sympathy, while feeling repelled by her choices in life. Michael, as a youth, is made exceptionally realistic with David Cross in the role. Ralph Fiennes shows the disappointment of a middle aged man as he looks back on his life; yet he is capable of changing course. The acting of Ralph Fiennes and David Kross as Michael and Kate Winslett as Hannah Schmitz gives the movie its punch. Two people whose lives cross give shape to a complex and profound story.",8,0,0,12 December 2015
Jaws," Classic man-beast struggle
","I first saw Jaws in 1975 and found it one of the most thrilling movies I'd ever seen. It became one of the most parodied movies of the 1900's because of the use of a huge mechanical shark that was more funny than terrifying. I can honestly say, however, that the movie still is great entertainment. I think it panders to our innate fear of what is unseen and lurks under the surface of the water. In fact, the glimpses of the fin and the outline of the creature under the water were more effective than the closeups of that huge, fake mouth. In the movie, the small resort town in Maine is the victim of the ocean monster which pops up in its major tourist attraction, its ocean playground. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus were just starting to make their mark and both excelled in Jaws. Director Stephen Spielberg went on to create many more great productions. Robert Shaw's performance as shark hunter Quint is memorable as the character who has a love-hate relationship with killer sharks. The movie is about a small resort town terrorized by the 25 foot shark at the start of the summer tourist season. The sudden crisis pits police officer Brody, played by Scheider, against the town mayor (played by Murray Hamilton) and the local merchants. The first attack takes place unexpectedly in the dead of night. The police chief is unable to get authorization to shut down the beach and the death toll mounts. The audience is gripped with tension every time the camera zooms in on the swimmers. In his quest to hunt and kill the shark, Scheider is aided by the erratic and foolhardy Quint (Shaw) and Hooper (Dreyfus), a trained shark expert who is often at odds with Quint. The incredible size of the shark stuns both Hooper and Quint but the challenge raises their resolve to fight and the two men become comrades in their fight against the beast. Scheider marshals the talents of Quint and Hooper and draws on his own substantial reserve of courage. What follows is a classic man vs. beast struggle. At one point we get some comic relief on the boat as Quint and Hooper compare battle scars, while drowning their fears in alcohol. Quint also tells a harrowing tale where sailors perish during the war in shark infested waters waiting for help. Note: Robert Shaw, who played the shark hunter, died only three years after the release of this move at age 51. He was a writer and an alumni of the British theatre scene, who also played in movies alongside Sean Connery and Richard Burton. Shaw lived a full life and as well as his career as an actor, he was married three times and had ten children.",8,5,11,13 March 2014
The Good Shepherd," Character study of a man in the CIA
","I saw this movie for the second time and found it every bit as good in 2009 as it was in 2006. It has a British atmosphere, quite different from Matt Damon's other work. It is a psychological spy story about a young man who makes his career with the CIA from the time of its creation. He stays there and the nature of the work takes a toll; in fact, it overtakes his life. The protagonists are engaged in a career of civilian warfare. We witness the old boy network from the upper-crust schools, the lack of real friendships and trust, and the failed home life. Damon's character evolves from a liberal arts student at Yale where he is smart and respected to a shadowy, stooped figure who realizes what his life has done to him. (The comments about him not ageing are not particularly relevant because you can sense it in his acting.) The character does not say this in so many words but it is clear that he has regrets. He is a private man who can keep confidences and this is why he was recruited for the position as a young man. In the end, he comes to grips with the person he has become but he is still capable of knowing the difference between virtue and vice, despite a career that is morally neutral. Angelina Jolie is the long-suffering wife and plays it to a tee. The expanding gulf between them does not diminish their love for their only child, played by a talented young performer, Eddie Redmayne. Because of him, Damon shows that he is still a human being. His mentors are played by performers like Michael Gambon (who pays a price for his indiscretions) and Robert DeNiro, who shows he is capable of not being completely consumed by the organization he headed up. There are brief appearances by actors like Joe Pesci, Keir Dullea (who goes back over 50 years), and Tim Hutton. His old girlfriend Laura (Tammy Blanchard) was his first love and he has a touching encounter with her much later in life.A very good movie and a class act by Matt Damon.",9,2,3,4 January 2009
Halloween," Halloween Horror in Haddonfield
","This movie must be the cinema's most memorable Halloween classic with a great story, haunting music, and chilling atmosphere from beginning to end.It marks the beginning of Jamie Lee Curtis's career and it is a fine performance with Jamie Lee playing the strong and level-headed young woman who is stalked by the 'bogeyman' - the phrase turns up on the lips of children and becomes a reality on this Halloween night. Donald Pleasance, as Dr.Loomis, the doctor for the psychopathic killer, is almost as chilling as the evil he is fighting. For him, the escaped killer is the essence of evil, who doesn't qualify as a human being. His eyes gleam with fear when he speaks in morbid and hushed tones. He is not someone you would want to meet in a dark alley but in this movie, he is the good guy, trying to prevent the inevitable slaughter that will follow in the trail of the convicted killer.The movie doesn't have a lot of blood and gore, as one might expect. It has murder and there is blood but the film is not particularly graphic. It doesn't depend on visual effects and sensational shots to achieve its goal, which is to frighten the audience. The suspense keeps us on edge until the killer and the target get to the final match-up. There were a few oversights that I noticed: there are never any parents at home--only kids or baby sitters; and while there are cutaways to children in costumes, we never see them trick or treating. Most of the time, the streets seem eerily quiet. There are many characters in the movie but only three really count--Laurie, Dr. Lomis and the killer. We never see the killer's face, except as a seemingly-innocent child but his presence stalks the audience throughout the movie. A very good horror movie that has stood the test of time.",9,0,1,25 October 2008
The Queen," A Week of Royal Angst
","One of the pivotal events of the 1990's was the tragic death of Diana, the Princess of Wales. This movie zooms in on the Royal Family in the aftermath. Wanting to keep the funeral private since Diana was no longer a member of the Royal Family, the Queen finds herself in conflict with her new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who correctly sensed the mood of the people early. He pressed the Queen to return from Balmoral and show her support. In times of national crisis, the Royal Family does not hesitate to lead the nation. In this case, however, the Queen was at odds with her prime minister, who also had to fend off his own advisers, some of whom wanted to use the opportunity to embarrass the monarch.Dame Helen Mirren plays the Queen. This highly accomplished actress came to public attention in the British television series Prime Suspect, where she played the hard-nosed inspector - Jane Tennyson. Taking on the role of a living monarch is a daunting prospect which presents great risk. Queen Elizabeth II is known to the public only on ceremonial occasions and photo opportunities. She is loved by some and ridiculed by others but generally respected. Dame Helen has risen to the occasion and seems to have mastered the public persona and mannerisms of the monarch to an astounding degree.The treatment of the Royal Family is not sympathetic. The family is isolated from the real world and has no sense of Diana's impact on the public. Tucked away in the castle in Balmoral, Scotland, the Queen is not about to bend to the will of the neophyte but politically-shrewd prime minister. Whether true or not, the royals were more taken with the appearance of a massive stag on the grounds of Balmoral. As we know, the Queen eventually came around. She sensed the harm that the press coverage was doing to the monarchy and felt she had no choice.Perhaps this is the key to the story and the success of the monarchy of Elizabeth. She has learned to keep the monarchy relevant by changing with the times, albeit reluctantly. An icon of the 20th century, still going strong in the 21st, Elizabeth is the only British monarch that most of us have ever known. Giving her a human face is Helen Mirren's great achievement.",8,0,0,5 April 2007
Fifty Shades of Grey," Controversial story well presented
","I decided to view Fifty Shades of Grey without having read the book and with a limited awareness of the controversy around the movie. However, the only way to judge a movie is to actually watch it. So I did. My reaction was positive to the characters and acting and the excellent film-making. Christian Grey, played by James Dornan, uses women to fulfil his particular taste for pleasure and the women he engages are free to leave him at any time. Based on the advice of his lawyer, he also signs ironclad contracts with each one. The previous women have all left him, some 15 altogether. This time, the young woman played by Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, is not about to rush in and there is an understanding on both sides to go slow for a while. Anastasia knows what the deal is and Christian is sincere about having her consent. However, Christian is not about to tell her what are his preferences in sexuality. There is a definite courtship pattern, where the super-wealthy Grey, while serious and cool, can still be very seductive. There is a definite attraction on both sides. When negotiating the contract, she makes it clear that she wants certain clauses deleted. He agrees to her requests without hesitation. In fact, she can stop doing what she agrees to at any point in the relationship or at any point in their activities. At one point, he finds out how inexperienced she is and proceeds to correct matters in a way that is erotic and sensuous. The next morning she is glowing with satisfaction. Her best friend can sense her happiness. The trouble is that Grey cannot go along with Anastasia's idea of a 'normal' relationship. At his urging, she allows it to go in another direction and she does not stop him. She tries to get him to open up and discovers that he himself had a relationship in which he was dominated, by a friend of his mother. The lessons learnt stayed with him. We sense that Anastasia may be softening him but he is not about to set aside his cold demeanour or his tastes in sexuality.After viewing the show, I was surprised at how benign this movie appeared to be, with the exception of one scene, which may have been toned down from the book. There a strong hint of romance from a man who does his utmost to avoid any semblance of a loving relationship. In fact, Grey seems to be completely in love with the young woman he meets in a hardware store, who is innocent and beautiful. One senses he is trying hard to please her without false pretences. It also ends on a note that was ambiguous but hopeful. There are short performances in this movie by a number of actors, including a walk-on appearance by Marcia Gay Hardon, as Grey's seemingly sophisticated and classy mother, and also Max Martini as Taylor, the enigmatic chauffeur, who shares or adopts his boss's serious manner.

The Deer Hunter," Life torn by war
","Michael Cimino, the director, has left us one powerful piece of work in this movie which is a portrait of small town life and how It is devastated by the war in Vietnam. The character development is superb with an outstanding cast of DeNiro, Walken, Streep, Savage and others. The small community in Western Pennsylvania is beautifully captured in the bar scenes, the wedding, the hunting trip, and the working life of the male characters in the local steel factory. I did notice the snowy mountains which didn't quite fit with my impression of Pennsylvania and it seems these were shot in Washington State. Not a huge deal given the calibre of the movie but I'm sure this wouldn't escape the notice of some viewers. The bond of friendship between DeNiro as Mike and Walken as Nick is sharply defined in the first hour and this relationship Is the basis for the story, which moves from Pennsylvaia to Vietnam and back again. We also see the angst heighten as the characters approach the day of Steve's wedding followed by their departure for Vietnam. The change in settings comes abruptly but flows seamlessly. The movie has dramatic war scenes that contrast with the beauty of the mountains where the deer hunting takes place. Graphic and shocking scenes in Vietnam heighten the sense of alienation from small town life in America. The movie is long but the script, the acting and imagery keep viewers riveted to this excellent story and its stunning photography.",8,1,3,12 June 2016
Rear Window," Classic Hitchcock from a unique perspective
","With the acting talent of two of Alfred Hitchcock's favourite actors, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and a strong supporting cast of Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr, we have the ingredients of a great movie. However, this movie is much more than the sum of its stars since the directing genius of Hitchcock is more than evident in this film, which is in the top tier of his work. The movie takes place on a small set; in fact, the action takes place in a bachelor apartment with cutaways to other apartments on the opposite side of a courtyard. The location is in a downtown neighbourhood of Manhattan. The viewer sees much of the action through the telephoto lens of Jimmy Stewart (known as Jeff to his friends), who is a photographer sidelined by an accident. He takes to watching the antics of his neighbours in his spare time. The comic and the sad come together as the camera pans from one apartment to another. The neighbour he is mainly interested in is the apartment of one Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr, who Jeff believes has killed his wife. Thorwald thinks he is acting without the knowledge of anyone but in fact, there is an intruder looking on from the other side of the courtyard, through his rear window. Raymond Burr gives a convincing portrayal of the sinister Mr. Thorwald – a far cry from the suave, courtly lawyer known on T.V. as Perry Mason. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Carol Freemont, enhances the look of this movie every time she walks on the set. In every scene, she appears like a model from the 1950's. I didn't count the number of costume changes she made but they must have been numerous and she made the most of each one. She is a class act every time she appears and plays the role of the uptown Manhattan girl to a tee. The close-ups of her are eye candy of the first order. In fact, Jimmy Stewart hesitates to marry her because as he says, 'she's too perfect'. Thelma Ritter (Stella) as the housebound photographer's nurse/masseuse/housekeeper is an absolute marvel with her quick repartee and New York twang to give it that extra zing. During her career, she was nominated for several Academy Awards and is a rich talent. Stella is almost a surrogate mother to Jimmy Stewart, playing the devil's advocate and giving her own two cents'worth on the love match between Lisa and Jeff, particularly Jeff's reluctance to wed. The plot moves toward the climax when Thorwald realizes he is being stalked and after Jeff finally enlists the support of his buddy Det. Doyle (Wendell Corey). The voyeur's interest in his neighbours leads to some skilled speculation by Jeff that could at any point have been blown away by a logical explanation, as Doyle was suggesting. But the evidence kept mounting and became more and more difficult to ignore. Some hands-on detective work by Lisa and Stella moves the story towards its climax. This classic movie will hold your interest from its amusing start to goose-bump finish. Along the way, there is a fine script and lots of wit. The vignettes involving the neighbours highlight the degree to which Jeff has taken to voyeurism, honing his observation of human behaviour. When he realizes what he has observed, there is a long silence, very effective. Photography forms a major role in this film, especially the use of the telephoto lens. Views through the viewfinder form part of the key visuals. Hitchcock makes good use of the growing appreciation for professional photography as the skills of one photographer become the basis for a case of murder.",9,3,5,1 March 2009
Saboteur," Great Hitchcock entertainment from 1942
","Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The leading actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper, and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the movie more stature. This is a good movie anyway with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock movies, we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well-heeled. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent. These upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect. Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. He wanted to elevate the regular guy, the bungler and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously. One can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra mold. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-next-door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, as the spunky female lead, comes off as the all-American girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test. Robert Cummings, as defence plant worker Barry Kane, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas from previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn into the action, e.g. Madeleine Carroll in the 39 Steps, and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels. We view scenes of America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of. We see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabins, truckers, the Hoover Dam and finally, New York City. New York is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners (with a cut to the ship Normandy) and the grand finale on the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Don't miss it.",8,0,1,18 September 2008
The Birds," Tangled Relationships in a Suspense Thriller
","The Birds presents a story of a young woman named Melanie Daniels, played by Tippi Hedren, who pursues a handsome stranger played by Rod Taylor, as Mitch Brenner, to an outlying fishing village north of San Francisco, where she encounters an unusual phenomenon of birds attacking people. Aside from the main story, we find some interesting characters in the village: a young school teacher named Annie Hayworth, played by Suzanne Pleshette, who left San Francisco to be with Mitch and never returned and Jessica Tandy, as Mitch's mother Lydia Brenner, who delivers the cold shoulder to any woman who is interested in her son. So Melanie Daniels, the daughter of a wealthy newspaper baron, finds herself at odds with Annie and the mother Lydia. Both Melanie and Annie are in conflict with Lydia, a common foe and this brings the two women to form an awkward friendship. The three main female characters have roles defined by their connection to Mitch. For me, the characters of the female performers are a memorable part of the movie. Melanie's strong streak of independence attracts Mitch but doesn't work too well with his mother, who seems bent on keeping her son a bachelor who can help fill the gap that followed the death of her husband four years before Melanie arrives on the scene. Melanie is a prankster and someone who is used to getting her way but she shines in a crisis that puts her to the test. Melanie is tough but she can also show her soft side with Mitch's younger sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) and the two form a strong bond.The movie comes to a climax with the massive bird assaults which unfold very slowly with some small incidents and to add to the suspense, cutaways to birds crowding together on phone poles and play structures. The suspense was very effective with the muted sound track followed by the sudden burst of birds. With the birds becoming a threat to the village, we can feel the tension building before key scenes. I did find the attacks too over the top but Hitchcock was never one to shy from trying something new. The birds become Melanie's main opponent and require her to draw on untested sources of strength and determination. Mitch too performed heroically in the test against the forces of nature. Both Mitch and Melanie showed their mettle through their sheer endurance, a great partnership in adversity. The ending is enigmatic but allows the viewer lots of scope to speculate.",8,3,5,1 December 2014
Cinderella Man," Jim Braddock - people's champion
","If you are a fan of movies with a heart, such as Rocky or Seabiscuit, you will like Cinderella Man. Directed by Ron Howard, this movie is about gentleman Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) who shows his dogged determination to overcome his underdog status in life and in the ring. After falling from a comfortable life with the onset of the Depression, he becomes an older and humbler man who must draw deep from within for the courage to eke out a living and do what is required for his wife and family. In his struggle, he has the undying support of his personal pillars - his wife (Renee Zellweger) and his trainer and friend (Paul Giamatti). Through it all, he never loses his large reserve of common sense or gives in to despair. He is rescued from the indignity of having to line up for work on a loading dock when he is offered the chance for comeback. Dismissed as a has-been, he struggles to regain his form. All along, the future of his wife and three children are uppermost in his mind.Before seeing this movie, I knew about the greats of the heavyweight boxing world...Johnston, Dempsey, Louis, Marciano and Ali but now, the name of Jim Braddock will come to mind. He was the hero of the downtrodden of New York (many were Irish like him) in the midst of the depression. He was a classy guy who went on to enjoy personal success. No one could deserve it more. In the Frank Capra tradition, this movie does what Hollywood does best, that is to inspire and show us how one individual can triumph in an ugly world.",7,1,1,11 April 2007
All the President's Men," On the trail of political crime and corruption
","This movie retells the role of two young reporters in the downfall of president Richard Milhous Nixon. It is now 40 years since this movie first appeared and it still strongly resonates with me. The reporters, played by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, show the tenacity and courage it took to expose the crimes and misdemeanours of Nixon and the people in his administration that resulted in the ruin of lives and careers. The movie couldn't cover the range of misdeeds that marked this administration in its use of power, unprecedented in the history of the United States. However, once they smelled a rat, the government bloodhounds couldn't stop them in their mission. I was riveted by how they sought out the people they needed to question to get at the truth. The information they received was often volunteered unaware by those who revealed names and other information. At one point after interviewing a book-keeper, played superbly by Jane Alexander, Bernstein came back to the newsroom with notes scribbled on bits of paper, napkins etc. One lead followed another with personal contacts, phone calls, door knocking and combing through lists. Trying to be coy, they used the technique of raising 'just one more thing' to elicit key bits of evidence without appearing too inquisitive. The two young men were supported, questioned relentlessly, and watched closely by older newsman and boss, played by Jack Warden. Jason Robards shined in the role as the iconic Ben Bradlee, the managing editor. This movie gives a real taste of the legwork, digging and intuitive journalism that led to one of the most dramatic stories in US. political history.",Null,3,3,15 June 2016
The Fighter," Fighting Family divides and unites over boxing
","This movie is based on a true story where the viewer sees the dynamics of a family which lives and breathes for boxing and for the two brothers who carry their hopes. The two brothers, Dickie and Mickey Ward of Lowell, Massachusetts, are performed by Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Christian Bale as Dickie Ward is the older brother who is unable to focus his tremendous energy and this leads to crack addiction, uncontrolled behavior and time in prison. Mickey Ward is the younger brother who wants a better life and has the self-discipline to make it happen. He breaks off from his brother and mentor and when the older brother returns from prison, he is unwilling to rehire him as his coach. His mother (Melissa Leo) and sisters fly into a rage, taking the older brother's side against Mickey and his girlfriend, played by Amy Adams. Mickey, out of family loyalty, takes his brother back as coach to prepare for a fight for the world welterweight championship. Mickey is a human punching bag and a glutton for punishment but smart enough to keep his hands up and to know that if he wears the other guy down, he can land the killer punch. There are several farcical scenes in this family's war with one another. The cast is outstanding and the boxing scenes make us feel like we have ringside seats. A fine boxing movie with human drama, I like this movie and would gladly watch it again.               ",Null,0,0,27 July 2011
Atonement," An act of malice leaves a bitter legacy
","Occasionally a movie comes along that leaves you with a great feeling of satisfaction. This movie has the layered effect of a modern novel, looking at life's events from the perspective of time and drawing them together In a way that gives some sort of closure. There is no way to change the past; we can look back with remorse but admitting the truth is the right way to deal with the human cost. Let it be said that the first 30 minutes are slow-going but this background is necessary to understand the story that follows. Pay attention to the perspective of the young people whose lives will quickly unfold and unravel after the initial scenes take place.The movie gives us images of great beauty, childhood fantasies, grotesque scenes of war, actual newsreel footage and a sad incident that haunts the main characters for the rest of their lives.British cinema and literature often deal with the underdog but not in the Frank Capra tradition of happy endings. This alternative tradition says that life can be mean and unfair, don't gloss it over with fairy tales cloaked in patriotism and heroism. This movie delivers that message in a fine piece of film-making by director Joe Wright.",10,2,4,12 February 2008
