Howl's Moving Castle," Beautiful and funny
",There are lovely touches of understated humour throughout this beautiful looking film which reflect the tone of original story really well. It is also suitable for watching with children without boring yourself silly.,7,2,3,16 June 2018
Captain Marvel," Good fun
",This was a fun watch with a great sound track and a few nice cameos. It won't be winning any Oscars but I wanted to be entertained and I was.,7,0,2,9 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Lockdown fun
","Like Eurovision it's far too long, cheesy, camp and has additional Conchita Wurst and Graham Norton. Dan Stevens as the sexy Lion of Love is a complete treat. His performance would easily win a real contest. There is a kind of menopausal Glee section in the middle with previous euro winners doing their stuff and there were several very funny laugh out loud moments. Of course there is lots of unnecessarily filler and very juvenile humour but overall this was far better than I expected. If you don't like Eurovision you probably won't like this though.",7,7,12,27 June 2020
Bird Box," Solid adventure
","A good and gripping start with a wonderful performance by John Malkovich, but a film that doesn't always live up to that initial promise. I enjoyed watching to the end though and would recommend giving it a go as it's much better than the last couple of netflix specials. The only downside for non-US viewers is the over botoxed, made up face of Sandra Bullock looks nothing like a person who'd lived in a post-apocalyptic world for 5 years would but I imagine we, in Europe, will have faces like that soon....",6,5,13,22 December 2018
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Predictably silly
","This was the usual juvenile Apatow/Reilly fare but great fun to watch. It's worth it for the Let's Duet scene alone - in fact the music is so well done I spat out my wine laughing at one point. John C Reilly is utterly brilliant - it's his 'Elf' moment. 
I watched Walk the Line the following evening as this is so clearly based on that movie primarily and kept giggling all the way through at jokes I'd missed. In short it's just a good fun movie with some very fun musical humour.",7,0,0,22 June 2018
The Intouchables," Wonderful and very funny
","I don't usually watch French movies but this was so laugh out loud funny right from the start - I just loved it. I loved that the film provides an irreverent approach to subjects usually dealt with in a sombre and overly PC way and hope the American remake does it credit. European humour does tend to be more daring often and fans of British comedy will love this. Whatever your preferences, I highly recommend this to anyone needing cheering up, honestly it's like a warm bath and a hug from a loved one - and that it's in French does not detract one bit from the humour.",9,1,4,13 January 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Dull CGI chase movie
","The multiplexes are already full of American movies and American superheroes. Why make even the Potterverse yours? There have been so many great recent films (In order of disappearance, Intouchables, Death at a Funeral) that have been turned into substandard murrican versions that those of us in what is actually often referred to as ROW (rest of world) are a bit fed up. So J K Rowling gets all CGI-d up and Eddie Redmayne is roped in to play the blithering, Hugh Grant style English chap. Lots of crashy bashy chase scenes and none of the subtleties of the Harry Potter movies. Good if you cant sleep though.",4,0,1,31 March 2020
The Favourite," Very odd
","Like Lanthimos's The Lobster, this movie is a strange, surreal but strangely enjoyable romp. Bits of it are funny, bits are accurate, bits hang together and others just don't. It's almost worth watching for the costumes alone and the cast are all superb but it certainly won't be for everyone. It's not really a comedy, it's not really a biography and it doesn't really have an ending. It's weird: if you liked The Death of Stalin, you'll probably like this.Olivia Coleman is wonderful as the queen with a performance that deserves all the accolades, the movie overall not so satisfying but worth a watch nevertheless.",6,2,4,4 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Loved it, superb performances
",I haven't anything new to add to the 1000s of reviews already here as we only got this today in the UK - it was a blast. I go to the cinema to be entertained and this is the most entertained I've been for a long time and the most entertaining Tarantino has been for a while too. The performances of Pitt and di Caprio are off the scale good and there are so many throw back references I know I'll enjoy a second viewing.,8,15,23,15 August 2019
Parasite," Worthy oscar winner
","I loved this: it only came out in the UK this weekend and I needed to see it before the oscar winners were announced. The use of colour, space and sound is superb. The actors are perfect and it's just wonderfully funny and thrilling at the same time. I found it a little slow to get into but it was worth the effort: the poor of society are so often treated as like cockroaches; a different species, parasitic, work shy, undeserving. And, as one of the characters points out, if we were wealthy how much easier would it be for us to be kind and generous people? The wealthy here are not evil, simply oblivious.",8,10,15,11 February 2020
