Deepwater Horizon," Great Movie for Climate Change Deniers
","If you're worried about being lectured about the environmental impact of mining for fossil fuels, don't, because this movie doesn't mention it once. We don't even learn anything about any the damage this disaster caused. Everyone is an all American hero and you can continue your day feeling completely guilt free.If you can accept the movie is complete fantasy, you might enjoy the special effects.Absolute trash.",2,0,5,11 January 2020
