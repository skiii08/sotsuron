The Lobster," Simply put - this movie is boring
","I decided to write a review on this movie for the sake of ranting and to (hopefully) inform people about it. Everything checked out about this movie - yet it was awful. I'm taking matters into my own hands. The fact is that the characters are emotionless or at least they suppress their emotions. It's a dystopian world they live in and society has everyone's lifestyle and behavior programmed. There are a lot of slow motion scenes and unnecessarily so. Those were particularly dull and hard to focus on. Many scenes were unnecessary, lingering way too long on the same thing.I often felt my attention drifting away and I actually had to make an effort to register what was going on. The dialogue is monotonous, full of intervals of silence yet abrupt. The music was awful, deliberately weird and out of place I think. There's a specific thundering sequence that was so unbelievably annoying and repetitive that my friend and I laughed about it. The ending was indefinite and the most boring of all. I was indifferent to the Lobster and that's how it left me feeling as well. Indifferent to everything except the time I wasted preparing to watch this movie and watching it. I would've abandoned it by the 5th minute if it weren't for good company. So that's that, overall a snobby film. Reminds me of the Grand Budapest Hotel, except that at least had aesthetics.",1,45,76,24 March 2016
500 Days of Summer," meh
","It wasn't that good of a movie. I wouldn't have missed out on anything if I hadn't watched it. Zooey Deschanel wasn't 'crystallized' as a character, she was too casual and I couldn't make a connection to her. Joseph Gordon Levitt mostly just looked at her lustily. The relationship with the the guy and his friends was typical, them talking about the girl he likes. Zooey being all mysterious... This is one of those movies that's supposed to be different from the typical rom com, since - spoiler - they don't end up together again in the end. But it's the same thing, just a different packaging. The so called 'rebel' rom-com. My favorite thing about this movie is that it got me thinking about labels in relationships and knowing where you stand. I was closer to Summer's view on the subject- to just enjoy spending time with people, from one encounter to the next. To not have to commit yourself to concepts of boy/girlfriend. But then again, I like consistency just as the guy does. if you think of someone as your boy/girl friend, that means you expect certain things from them. It's an established concept, you have to be willing to meet the other person half way in things and to make compromises or else it's not gonna work out. if you want to feel the reassurance of having a bond with someone, you have to know that you'll feel as much pain as you do pleasure. Everything you've been given has the power of being taken away from you as well. I agree that you never know how things will end up, even if you legally seal the relationship in marry. Even then you can also wake up one day and realize you don't want it anymore, or you could gradually realize it. The difference is you'll probably spend more time trying to make it work and fix it. It'll be harder and more painful to break it off. So, in the end it isn't JUST about putting a corny label on something, it's about making someone know what you mean to them and what you're willing to do for them. it's about reassurance. Casual can turn into acting casual pretty quick, so as not to get your feelings hurt. there's a casual phase in most relationships.. but if you want to feel something more exciting, you got to level up. that means more disappointment and all that stuff too. anyways, i found it unrealistic how the two of them kept randomly meeting each other throughout the movie. i wish there was more intentional meetings or phone calls after the break up. what the guy (sorry, i forgot his name) experienced after summer, she probably did with another guy before him. he got his expectations crushed and gave up on love himself. summer after getting married made him realize that both notions were too extreme. soul mates, love at first sight, fate and all that fairytale stuff is unrealistic as well as not believing in love at all or daring to bond with someone. she found middle ground i guess. i'm glad the guy decided to approach the woman who was interviewing for the same job as him. i like how the idea of fate was crushed. to me, fate is a lot about just letting stuff happen to you, because what happens will happen and some things are just meant to be. i don't like that attitude because you'll end up waiting too much instead of taking things into your own hands. sure, everything comes full circle but it's a matter of time. do you want to just sit and do nothing, wait for stuff to happen to you and for people to approach you, or do you want to feel in control of your life? that's why i'm glad the guy initiated something with the girl. i thought it was kind of corny that her name's autumn, and then day 1 again. but that's just me, i see how it makes sense.",5,1,2,11 April 2016
