The Blair Witch Project," Wicked...
","As I sit here and listen to 'Josh's Blair Witch Mix', I can't help thinking back to earlier in the evening when I first got my chance to see this much talked-about film.  It was kind of slow but funny in parts in the beginning. Towards the middle, the drama of the movie unfolds, showing the acting talents of the 'stars' of the film, and some of the creepiness starts to crawl up your spine, despite the occasional repetitiveness of the fighting and bickering that goes on.  Then, the end comes out of nowhere hitting you right between the eyes like a hammer!  Heather Donahue deserves an oscar in my opinion for an absolutely chilling and convincing performance.  She is an absolute wonder.  This movie will scare the living heck right out of you. Honest.  When Heather apologizes late in the film, with tears in her eyes, you know fear.  An unbelievable cinematic achievement (and thank your lucky stars that it is unbelievable...).  See it at all costs!  This is a MOVIE!",10,1,2,31 July 1999

","I originally saw this film in the movie theater the weekend it was released in wide release.  Going into the theater I knew the movie was just fiction, coming out I was GLAD it was...  Miss Donahue's acting is incredibly convincing and I think she should get an Oscar just based on her performance in this piece.  The men she has supporting her are very talented as well, but she just steals the show.  This movie has the dubious distinction of being the creepiest movie I have ever seen.  Until now that title was held by Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'.  Stephen King's baby has just been outcreeped...",10,1,2,29 October 1999
