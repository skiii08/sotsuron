"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Dumbed-Down, seen it 10 times before bland
","Run Fatboy Run doesn't have much going for it. It is completely unoriginal and pandering. It tries to mix in a bit of drama with mostly comedy and pretty much fails on most levels. A few of the comic moments are chuckles, but they don't come close to enough to make up for the utter clich√© and by-the-numbers acting by everyone involved. Running gags too are not funny just weak. And then there's the old MTV syndrome of mixing in music for 3 min song beats instead of trying to run exposition - a crutch and shameful bale of a lot of directors these days. For any director reading, once again, MUSIC IS MEANT TO ENHANCE not stand for picture-time! So is this movie absolutely horrible, no, but it doesn't offer anything new, nor does the performances and storyline. Rent it when it goes off the new release section or better yet, check it out at the library.",4,1,2,9 May 2009
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Pandering Junk Fare
","Its pretty sad when a sequel's main objective is to pander and market itself into junk fare. The original National Treasure while not a masterpiece either, had a little bit more going for it in it's story. Here, in this money-vehicle, we have some top-rate actors including Helen Mirren and Ed Harris signing on to what is more or less marketing by-the-numbers tripe. Aside from a bit of the old Nickolas Cage best in Honeymoon In Vegas and his smug one-liner zinging, this movie is in-bred for the masses of people who want to be spoon-fed implausible junk packaged to seem historical and thus validated. Are we supposed to believe savvy educated folks cant figure out that their cell phones have been bugged? And just the pandering in the dialog bent on being provocative is awful. And why do we always need sidekick comic relief. Commonplace and unimaginative, the Book of Secrets seems written by a 3rd grader. Thumbs down.",5,0,1,22 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Getting Old and Tiresome
","Here's a franchise that definitely needs to be put to bed and fast. Directed by Rob Marshall, 'Pirates of the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides' is mostly a bore and more rehash and retread than anything else. Depp and Rush are back at it as their characters, but the characters themselves have completely worn out their welcome. The story is over-long, and has a couple of fairly interesting sequences - one being Depp's initial escape from the King of England, and two a Mermaid 'battle', but these last only a scant 20 min of the bloated 130 min runtime. I fast-forwarded through a good chunk of this movie. You'd think they'd figure it out that a movie needs a lot more than a new character and quest for it to be worth your viewing time. Give it a miss.",4,7,9,9 January 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Fair, Maybe Average
","Saw this in the theater on a friends treat, and wasn't disappointed, but at the same time wasn't dazzled either. The movie is in motion much of the runtime, and I actually fell asleep for part of it due to lack of sleep before - not really due to the movie itself perhaps. It has a lot going on and is frenetic; yes there's a lot to look at, but many scenes don't feel substantial or of merit - too much filler. Having a lot of motion and action doesn't necessarily make a movie better. Anyway, Comparing it to it's original, I don't think it's as good. I liked the action sequences and McAdams in the original better as well as the original's story. The dialog in Shadows, garners some snickers, but the movie really follows it's older predecessor's blue-print - music is a re- tread and again interesting. 6/10 - around average",6,2,9,21 December 2011
Gremlins," Has it's Moments
","Used to watch this movie fairly often as a teenager after it's release. It's got a pretty good re-watch-ability factor for being a mid-80s flick. The puppeteers, make-up, and costuming, have done a great job throughout the production while the animation and effects are maybe passable. The story is streamlined and focused and the pacing very good. The acting is satisfactory and passable, but nothing splendid except for maybe Hoyt Axton who helps bring some gravity and grounding to the whole cast. Of course the gremlins are the stars of the show. They have their moments and get plenty of screen time. Some of the gags work, while others fizzle. I liked the word-play and vocals done for the gremlins - you can notice some high profile voice actors in the cast like Peter Cullin and Frank Welker. It's not a great movie really, but it has some entertaining moments and did well enough to 'spawn' a poorer sequel. Mildly recommended for nostalgia's sake.",6,3,5,12 August 2010
The Incredible Hulk," Strong Beginning but Poor Romance/Gratuitous effects
","The Incredible Hulk starts it's story moving immediately assuming we already know the story lines which is mostly true. This is a good idea as there's a quick prelude and setup to the story. I enjoyed the first 20 min of it pretty well - good pacing, good action, decent acting, and wonderful locale of Brazil capped off with a great chase scene. However Liv Tyler is a poor casting choice and it becomes a problem once she enters the story. Her acting is somewhat vanilla and the romance between her character and Edward Norton's is really flat. Detractingly awful actually. What's worse is there's a good 20 min of it at least during the movie - too much emphasis on a weak link. She needs some better direction and work with the scenes alongside the Hulk CGI too - she looks like she's staring off in different places instead of the Hulk's face. Additionally William Hurt is pretty forgettable as supposedly a brass general as there's too much subdued in his actions and conversations to make him believable as a leader. Edward Norton gives a rather standard performance - not as good as some of his past movies but satisfactory. This new Hulk is lavish with effects, some pretty exciting action sequences, and the Green man looks pretty good more like the comic-book looks like the aim of it. Probably the best performance is by Tim Roth as sort of an over-zealous soldier owing to good writing in this instance. Anyway The Incredible Hulk is not as good as Iron Man (spoiler - if you've seen Iron Man you'll love the cameo.) needing more humor, but definitely better than the earlier recent Hulk by Ang Lee who failed in the look. This is a good effort unfortunately with some standout flaws, but worth a watch certainly. Effects get piled on almost gratuitously towards the end though.",6,2,5,22 July 2008
Captain Phillips," Decent Realism but Drags the 2nd Half
","One of the issues with 'Captain Phillips' for myself as a viewer and probably a lot of folks is that you already know the outcome of the movie before watching, so coming in it's like watching a recorded game you already know the outcome to. Despite this, Director Paul Greengrass has worked with Tom Hanks,and a quartet of young green African-emigrated actors to goto great lengths in recreating authentic looking settings, dialog, and characters - and the movie is helped by this level of effort. To this end we have close ups and shots of Naval ships in what looks to be deployed operations as well as close-in tactics on display. Even with all this, the story lags and needs some getty-up about the last 45 min or so. The dialog and action becomes stagnant, and the movie bogs down. I grew tired of listening to the yelling and repeated dialog type between Hanks and the Captors. By the end I was ready for it to end. Fairly good, but perhaps could've had better pacing. 6/10",6,0,1,8 November 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," As Bad as New Moon or maybe Worse
","Probably as bad as 'New Moon', an awful first half drags 'Breaking Dawn' down pretty far. The whole highly overcooked romance honeymoon-thing dragged out and made me wanna ralph it was so poorly done and kooky. The cheese in these scenes could've taken your nose off. Equally bad was the MTV music cuts, that were littered in scene after scene after scene ad nauseum. Some of the earlier Twilight films and likewise many younger filmmakers and films seem to have a problem with awful music videos that really detract and distract from the main movie content. Only thanks to finally a bit of tension and conflict in the last 30 min, does the movie manage to semi-salvage some interest, but not much or enough. It was a kooky Rosemary's Baby somehow infests the Twilight brand. More to come it seems",4,5,6,3 March 2012
The Equalizer," Entertaining but Ridiculous - Mixed
","(spoilers) If you're in the mood for a Mindless action movie with a standard Denzyl Washington performance, the you might like director Antoine Fuqua's 'The Equalizer'. And notice Mindless with a capital 'M'. Here you have a lead character, conjured as part Macgyver, part, part Casey Rybeck and part Jason Bourne though infused with the eloquence of Washington. It makes for an interesting and CALM Bad@$$. The movie though is completely ridiculous making Equalizer character Robert McCall into a superhero, with super-reactions - devoid realism. In only one fight the whole movie is he actually physically challenged, and oh, what an unclimactic terrible final fight with the Martin Csokas, playing a menacing enough bad guy. The thugs are imbeciles or brainless, and the untouchability of Washington's character got stale quickly. 6/10 for Washington's effort and some fun action scenes.",6,0,0,17 January 2015
Source Code," Unfocused but Good Concept
","Anyone who's a Star Trek fan will immediately recognize that the creators of 'Source Code' have wholly taken freely from their content - in this case, if you're interested, watch Star Trek The Next Generation's episode entitled 'Cause and Effect'. That episode is better polished than this movie and minute for minute a better production despite being 17 or so years done before it, (spoiler) but the movie does a good job with the idea of replaying time over again and again. You cant blame the creators for employing a good idea. The problem is, the human aspect of the story gets overcooked and overdone in Source Code, and Jake Gyllanthal although did a satisfactory job, probably the lead role could have been afforded to a better actor. I liked Source Code, especially it's explanations and details of what's happening during the first two-thirds of it's length. The love interest though doesn't quite mesh, and unfortunately the ending is painted too rosy and gets sappy. Still if you like science-fiction and it's employment of time as a theme, and you liked 'Source Code' check out the Star Trek episode mentioned above if you've never seen it, enjoy and marvel at the parallels.",6,1,2,31 August 2011
Stop-Loss," Fair and by the Numbers
","Stop-Loss involves some decent acting from Ryan Phillippe and his supporting cohorts. The movie plays it safe for the most part, not offering much new besides the subject material. I liked how the main character grappled with the Stop Loss problem - you can sense the injustice, but reality of contracts sets in. Story lines throughout the movie have been done before. There's honor, friendship, commitment etc etc....(spoiler) the closing scenes seem to come full circle and leaving us wondering what the whole fuss was about. Likewise, the final shots, I noticed the big bold US ARMY logos on uniforms and couldn't help wondering if the movie went that direction as sponsored so by the military (ie selling out). If you like fairly well done dramas, Stop Loss is a decent watch - but it doesn't offer any answers. It looks to inform us of a problem and then meekly get in line.",6,1,1,31 January 2009
It," Only as Good as Your Source/Script
","I remember seeing several people I knew reading a very thick looking Stephen King's 'IT' paperback novel, and asking how it was with a 'so-so' initial response. I've never been much of a fiction reader. That reaction is about the same as my take on this new 2017 remake movie from director Andy Muschietti (whom I've never heard of until now). It has the feel more recently of Super 8 and Muschietti is reaching into 80s material (ala Goonies, ET, or Stand by Me) to recreate it. This aspect of the movie is endearing, but the comedy shtick is clich√© and repetitive and the horror only marginal. In short the source material is not strong enough. So while the slick updated effects help, especially with Pennywise the Monster clown, the movie is disjointed, clich√©d, and repetitive thanks to a disjointed, repetitive story. Maybe recommended for Stephen King fans though 6/10, but it's no 'Shining' though.",6,1,5,16 September 2017
If I Stay," Made for Teen Drama
","Saw the decent average on IMDb and checked it out at Redbox blindly. Fairly shortly into the runtime I realized I was watching a musicky sitcom with dialog written by a 7th grader. Yes, the dialog in 'If I Stay' is cringe-worthy if you're looking for anything adult-like or with depth. Director RJ Cutler is targeting 14 yr old girls with this movie that seems almost like one of those preachy Christian movies thankfully without the Christianity. A sampling of teen dialog has characters stating, 'I know, I suck', or several utterances of 'skype.' I was hoping for something with more explanation into the supernatural or afterlife, but this movie is a straight, squeaky-clean Disneyish, 'School of Rock' without Jack Black and the classroom. Not recommended - 5/10.",5,2,4,24 December 2014
John Wick," $0.54 - way overpriced at Redbox
","Ultra-edited and devoid of originality, this turd is ultraviolence sensationalized for the sake of show with absolutely no thought. It is an over-the-hill Keanu Reeves Star Comeback movie without the comeback. It is a diarrhea & vomit of direction. Rather it has overcooked music and cheesepuff rock, and is as poor a movie as I've seen in the last few years. Well this IMDb rating is here to help bring some honesty to how bad this steamer is. Bad accents, bad dialog, Russian accented English or Russian interspersed with blah, blah who cares semblences of conversation - John Wick the boogie-man killer...BLAH! Think of better or even average action-thrillers like Equalizer, History of Violence, or the Taken movies, and this movie rips off from every single one. Made by 9 year olds. Slogged through this utter drivel knowing better. Embarrassing for all 'filmmakers' involved and the Mayhem guy from the insurance commercials catching a payday... 2/10 -",2,11,20,17 July 2015
Gravity," Best of 2013
","Watched 'Gravity' tonight, directed by Alfons Cuaron, and will admit I loved the movie. I am on the whole a harsh critic on movies, having watched so many, and am happy to report this movie assumes my vote for best in-theater watch visually since 'Avatar'. Also on sheer entertainment value it also beats out 'Mud' this year for best picture. The visuals are so well done that you could've put in amateur actors in the movie and it still would've been good, however, Bullock and Clooney certainly enhance the experience, and are excellent. (major spoilers) Perhaps most enjoyable for me was Bullock's characters hallucination or vision sequence that clearly took some of audience for a ride. Momentous visuals, and gives a feeling of the vastness of space and the insignificance of earth's size compared to space. Lastly, just great, simple suspense and superb music. 9/10",9,1,2,2 November 2013
Wind River," Very Good Crime-Drama
","Directed deftly by Taylor Sheridan, 'Wind River' is one of the better movies of 2017. It has a lean, stream-lined, story with great exterior shots of winter in Wyoming and dreary gray settings along with the oppressive spirit of the 'rez' . The crime and mystery portrayed at hand are as provocative as the landscape. Sheridan has a good grasp of what's important to drive the story. And as simple and impressive as the story is wild, the acting and direction of all involved keeps the tone grounded. Jeremy Renner plays an anguished but stoic working man. Graham Greene brings a bit of humor and realism on occasion. The finale of the movie amps it up a full degree with violent energy reminiscent to a western showdown.",8,4,6,18 November 2017
Star Trek," Good Effort with a few problems
","After some high praise from co-workers, finally got around to watching this new Star Trek saga getting launched. And I liked it although I wasn't head-over-heals for it. I see some similarities in the changes akin to the way the James Bond series was changed. There's a lot of sleek new looks and some fairly good acting, but in giving up or moving on from some the older formulas or patterns in it's series, it loses some things. I thought the story was pretty interesting although not original. The direction seemed pretty good as were the effects. I thought Zachary Quinto nailed it as young Spock and Karl Urban did a good job as young Bones. By far the best-done scene was the jump scene with the drill - extremely captivating and as much or more so than any Star Trek scene in any Star Trek movie. Some of the problems though were Eric Bana as a bland Romulan Nero. I don't know all the story and past details but the Romulans didn't look very interesting. Chris Pine as Kirk was just - OK. The creators in general tweaked characters that they should've stuck hard and fast to, and the acting either needs to completely clean slate the old casts mannerisms/ways of speaking or really make a strong effort to try to incorporate/mimic them. Instead we have some actors sometimes sounding like original actors and sometimes not - inconsistency. Some of the character tweaks were in poor taste too such as Uhura and the whole romance angle. And the having a Beastie Boys soundtrack in the beginning is trashy and UTTERLY misplaced. Maybe if you're a trekky of the original Star Trek's cerebral story lines and science-fiction you might be disappointed, but I was receptive and ready for the changes and ready to take most of the changes at face-value. I would agree the movie loses some of it's thoughtful pensive nature of the original series which actually does seem to detract, but still recommended to see in the theater for the action-oriented.",7,1,8,19 June 2009
Fury," Awful Script in Hollywood Stink-fest
","'You feel it, that's war' - This is the kind of myopic and clich√©d dialog that litters this 2nd-rate wanna-be Saving Private Ryan movie, along with the dozen or so empty bible quotes. 'Fury' is Hollywood window dressing devoid of substance in stark example. Thanks to it's unintelligent and anachronistic dialog, the movie has nothing to stand on. Characters swear in excess, and there is little to pull the story together, just bloody grisly fighting scenes interspersed with inane dialog. And why would German soldiers bull-rush a tank - an equal lack of realism. Indeed Director Ayer tries to add gratuitous blood in poor taste. The 'binocular' view camera effect reminds of bad 50s war movies while you have the requisite rookie, crazy, sentimentalist, and leader characters. To boot, the music is almost as bad as the dialog, indistinct and run-of-the-mill supermarket-ish. This movie is a failure of writing and direction. Not Recommended 3/10",3,5,10,29 January 2015
The Fan," Awful Pointless Spin on Psycho Movies
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich√É¬© of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies",2,6,8,14 February 2010
Iron Man 2," Fairly Good Sequel to a better Original
","A couple years ago Iron Man was a solid super-hero movie with a better story and dynamics than this film I thought. So, Iron Man 2 comes along and has to try to live up to it's predecessor and mostly does. It has a satisfactory villain and some excellent slick special effects, however I thought some of the dialog and story seemed to be reaching too much. Instead of meaningful clear cut conversations there becomes excessive banter (ok not nearly as bad as the Dark Knight). And the Paltrow/Downey relationship seemed to stale to unbelievability a bit. Lastly, couldn't they have come up with a new concept for villain(?), once again we have Iron Man fighting another pseudo Iron Man. Anyway despite a few of these detractions, Iron Man 2 is watchable, but probably not too re-watchable.",6,1,2,24 October 2010
World War Z," International Walking Dead with Brad Pitt & Big Budget
","As a fan of the Walking Dead TV show and 'Dawn of the Dead' movie, it would take a lot for filmmakers to mess up this effort for 'World War Z' given such a large reported budget, so you can count my review as biased. Director Marc Forster's movie is a sprawling disaster film with Zombies as the disaster. It manages to work for the most part as long as you forgive some issues which you probably are aware of. The movie essentially an International Walking Dead on steroids with Brad Pit starring. Some of the aspects of the movie I liked was it's pacing, tension , and suspense that it managed to pull off. The effects were OK, but not outstanding. The acting is decent; Brad Pitt is satisfactory in the movie. (Spoilers) What I didn't like (as usual with many movies) were several poor implausibilities that were missed such as Pitt's character forgetting to turn off his cell phone in a critical situation (South Korea) to stay quiet, and ditto later for mistakenly kicking a soda can. Similarly and more blatantly, how did the Israelis military and chanting crowd not know to keep noise down with so many zombies in Earshot? Finally as a technical issue, Satellite phones cannot work in the hull of a ship. The signal cannot pass through the various metal bulk-heads. These are the kinds of written in stupidities that are tiresome, clich√©d, lazy and hurt a movie's performance. Still considering, I liked World War Z as it had enough going for it to keep it interesting although not spectacular - and remember I give it the benefit of the doubt for liking the genre in the first place. Recommended for Zombie fans (7/10)",7,0,4,27 July 2013
The Impossible," Overdramatized Music
","(Spoilers)After a gripping and technically well-done 1st 30 min or so of 'The Impossible' and it's showcased tsunami, director Juan Antonio Bayona has a bit of a problem on his hands. He's pulled his best visual punches with still 2/3rds of the runtime left. This might be solvable for other directors, but Bayona is unfortunately lured or becomes reliant on substituting dramatic music into way too many scenes to try to instill emotion. What ends up happening is a complete over-saturation of the music, and in effect a cheapening of the event. Family-members are re-united with triumphant strings and grand score over and over and over. It starts to seem phony and tedious. To top it off, Bayona likewise relies much too heavily on focusing on the gore of the injuries. Too much dripping blood, cuts, or lacerations do we need to witness through close-ups. While I can't call the effort a miss, the movie seems like it could've been handled much better. Mixed review as the movie succeeded with it's recreation of the tsunami but got snared into some lesser problems..",5,2,5,5 May 2013
Argo," Loses it the Last Fifth of Runtime
","'Argo' directed and starring Ben Affleck is a fairly well done movie for much of its runtime. However, the piled on tension and suspense begins to get silly, contrived, and poorly clich√©d towards the last bit of the movie . (spoilers) For me the whole airport scene became comical starting with tickets coming through at just the right time, an incredulous security guard questioning in both Farsi and then English, accomplices getting to the phone a split sec in time, a clutch not working in a vehicle, and to top it off in a really bad way, Iranian cop-cars and a military van racing a 747 on the runway. This stuff all while bland, filler music is thrown together. Could this be anymore 'tense'?! There's no subtlety here and its boldly appalling. What'll be next(?), the Swiss Air 747 dodging RPGs over Tehran! No, too many liberties taken with a 'based on a true story' script, and so doesn't finish well....",6,2,4,1 February 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," By the Numbers Action Flick
","(Spoilers)'Star Trek: Into Darkness' is even less Star Trekish than it's predecessor movie, and not half as well done either. This movie is a partly rehashed and by-the-numbers Space Action movie populated by characters from the original Star Trek series. Some of the actors try to play it like the original cast some don't. The dialog is sitcomish in a bad way with 'witty' one-liners, and fairly bad effects. There's a bunch of 'action' masquerading as filler. A bad attempt falls flat to bring in an old-story-line from the original movie series(Star Trek II), and even another needless cameo. By the end of this overlong bore, I was checking my watch fairly often. Why can't directors and writers venture into original territory. I don't mind that they re-did this franchise, but at least put some thought into making better stories. 5/10 - watch on video.",5,1,3,16 June 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Pulls Out some Stops even if Sometimes Sentimental
","It's true, the high average review for this movie is somewhat warranted I'm happy to report as I enjoyed this movie when it was at it's best, pulling out the stops and (spoiler) heaping on the surprises. And this movie exceeds at doing that. 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is a movie which packs in quite a few laughs while managing to mostly veer away from the crude humor, something that in-and-of- itself deserves praise. The whole Steve Carrol and Ryan Gosling character relationship and development was a hoot. This is probably Steve Carrol's best movie to date and thanks in no small part to Gosling. Carrol is more or less in a reprieve of his usual character, but the script helps uplift him. Thereare unfortunately the occasional almost forced scenes of sentimentality too that feel mis-placed. Especially a lot of the Dad-to-Son talks, and wife and husband talk - which I patiently waited through as the heavy-handedness of those scenes would abate. Still let me emphasize the occasional nature of those scenes, not enough hurt my recommendation of a rental or check-out.",7,0,1,4 September 2011
Oldboy," Trys too hard at the end, predictable - not bad though
","The first third of the movie was well done especially the first 15 minutes or so - it was deranged, strange, and well told with the main character's description of his past and the way the time flashed by. You see the characters torment. Some very witty lines shine too with him wondering whether imaginary TV training can carry into the real world. However the violence often becomes too much of a spectacle and at times too glorified. While the visual content sometimes I question, the style and make-up of the cinematography is well done. Unfortunately as is often the case with movies - the ending suffers; the twist is more for shock value and very predictable - they would've done better going a traditional route with it, or at least something with a little more integrity. Also, the final suicide is absolutely pointless further detracting. How could the father make that decision also?? Anyway, worth a look if you can handle the utter lack of integrity to stoop to for entertainment's sake I guess - are you entertained by immoral, base, and twisted ideas? If so enjoy.",7,3,42,30 August 2005
Black Book," Competent, Involving, but Overlong
","'Black Book' yet another production concerning WWII Nazi struggle - this time the setting is Holland. Yes this genre seems to continue to pump out movie after movie, however, this Paul Verhoeven film turns out competent and involving despite a patience-testing 146min runtime. The villains, heroes, and especially heroine (played exceptionally by Van Houten)are well defined and very well acted. As expected from a Verhoeven production, you get graphic nudity, sex, and violence all wrapped in, but probably too much gratuitously graphic, and at one point -SPOILER- he goes too far with a humiliation scene towards the end. Despite that, the best aspect of this movie is the suspense and spying throughout the middle third of the movie. There's supposed double-crosses and plenty of action to back up as well. I mostly enjoyed it and recommend it for those with patience.",7,0,1,1 January 2011
Brokeback Mountain," Majestic backdrops - Ledger is excellent
","So several people at my work refused to see the 'gay cowboy movie'. Oh well. This movie certainly is a bit more complex than that description. Although I think 'Saving Face' is the best movie I've seen on people having to deal with homosexuality, this movie is a pretty good movie. Heath Ledger really shines as the stoic cowboy sort of caught up in something he's always ashamed of - his accent and mannerisms are tops; his character commands your interest and carries the movie....Jake Gyllenthal lends some decent support, although he doesn't hold his character nearly as defined (his accent wanders a lot). Actresses all provide convincing characters and support especially Michelle Williams as Ledger's poor confused wife. She and Ledger act out one of the better scenes in the movie over washing dishes The backdrops are spacious and majestic with vivid colors of nature, weather, wild-life, and plants. The movie takes you through years; one of the more difficult things for young actors to do is act aged/older, and that could've been handled a little better. Despite that, Brokeback Mountain is a tender drama with several poignant well done moments and always competently photographed. It deals with homosexuality as natural feelings for the characters, part of what people feel in an honest way.",7,5,29,15 April 2006
Orphan," Dense Characters/ Becomes Absurd
","The only thing going into 'Orphan' that we don't know is whether the movie is going to take to the supernatural or not. (Major Spoiler) In this case it takes the higher road in attempting to play it straight. Although, the movie would've been easier to flex the story and add in creativeness had the filmmakers elected the supernatural. Unfortunately the screenplay and dialog continue to bombard the cognizant viewer with gross liberties eventually stretching and finally shredding any kind of credibility or believability. The writing ends up propping up horrible common-sense to the point where characters are utter twits and pawns. The acting was fair, but by the end of the movie it doesn't matter - the movie is a failure - mostly a manipulative exercise with puppet characters devoid of intellect. This is the director and storytellers fault almost completely. Wasted potential.",4,3,6,13 April 2010
Aquaman," Clunky Start but Gets it Together
","(spoilers) The editing and sequencing and sometimes the dialog need help. Director Wan forgets any introductions, and goes for non-sequential development.. What follows is a mess for the first 30 min or so. The story gets some traction about the time Atlantis is wonderfully introduced; the visuals help us forget the shortfalls and problems with dialog, direction, and acting. Music soundtrack as pop-synths work well, but some of the contemporary soundtracks fall-flat. Jason Momoa's hang-loose mentality seems at first out-of-place and too loose, but we acclimate to it. Amber Heard is passable, and probably could've been done better by someone else. The movie is certainly like a live-action cartoon, and though sinks initially holds on to its grandiose bravado enough to become entertaining with the help of an underwater mishmash of medieval and scifi that works . 7/10 -- better than expected.",7,0,1,30 March 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," Favorite Miyazaki
","There really are no 'bad' Miyazaki movies. And Totoro was the 2nd one of his movies I'd seen, and after seeing most if not all of his movies, this one remains my favorite. It captures childhood innocence and countryside playing immaculately while introducing one of the most recognizable and iconic cartoon characters ever to come from Japan. Totoro is pure enjoyment and fun. From the music to the animation and the beloved Totoro and Neko-Bus, this movie shines and charms. There are so many wonderful scenes and most people will rightfully point to the bus-stop scene as the centerpiece scene - it's my favorite in the movie too no doubt; to add to that I liked the simple countryside story, the settings, background, the noises and sounds and the life depicted. The Japanese voice actors do a fine job as usual too. Totoro is a true classic of animation - as good or better as any Disney or other animation ever crafted, and most likely will remain my particular favorite. Simple, playful, and warm, Totoro will charm like few movies can. Tops - Highly recommended.",10,0,1,17 February 2010
500 Days of Summer," Enjoyable and Cutesy Growing Pains
","Clever, melancholy, and heartfelt, '500 Days of Summer' is an enjoyable romance and voyage into something many people have experienced and can relate to first-hand: heartbreak. It features a fairly simple story that employs the non-linear style of jumping days around to keep the narrative off-base a bit. The story would've been fine either way thanks to Joseph Gordon-Hewitt. His seriousness as in most his movies helps build tension, and makes it easier to empathize what his character is going through. I enjoyed the backgrounds and interests of the various characters and the interesting side-stories at the Greeting Card Office. As with too many movies these days, music gets overused, but luckily it doesn't get too folksy, the genre that really becomes disagreeable for my tastes. Nonetheless the movie runs a brisk 90 min or so, but still feels sufficiently introspective. Recommended.",8,0,1,20 November 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," OverLong, Repetitive but several Good Scenes
","This 3rd effort for the Pirates entertaining series falls somewhat short of both its predecessors. What it has going for it is a great middle third - including conjuring of the afterlife, kooky precepts and great dreamlike hallucinations with Jack Sparrow (reprised by Johnny Depp). Also the costumes, and make-up are once again top notch. (Spoilers) Likewise the Calypso Goddess effects scenes are also considerably good and Davy Jones (created in the 2nd movie in the series). However, the plot really drags along at far too pedestrian pace. The scenes become monotonous, sea-battle after sea-battle,...pirate-dialog after pirate dialog. (spoiler) Double-triple crosses etc. Even MORE characters to keep track of (think Spider-Man 3). By the time the final sea-battle comes along, though as spectacular as it looks, my attention span was kaput. Of course there's the requisite loose-ends for YET ANOTHER sequel. Supposing this were the last installment, it has it's merits surely, and some good attractive scenes. But Some serious paring is in needed here - starting with cutting down dialog or smaller subplots. Recommended as part of the series at best.",6,0,0,19 April 2008
Spider-Man 3," A Real Mess; Unfocused and Overlong
","After watching this mess of a Spiderman movie, the first thing that popped into my head was 'where was the editor?'. This is a mess of a movie. Too many characters, too many story lines, and extraneous story lines. The 'dark' Spiderman personality and storyline was laughable in a bad way. Dialog during many of the fight scenes sound as written by 4th graders. I guess this is what happens when a comic book series turned movie begins to grow stale - like the original Batman series. The writers and movie-makers needed to do some serious story editing and trimming. At least 45 min could've been trimmed starting with 20 min of Tobey McGuire doing a bad Mick Jagger impersonation as his supposedly altered-self. Did not and would not pay to see this unfocused overlong attempt. Back to the drawing board.",5,0,1,30 March 2008
Thor: Ragnarok," Over-Parody of Itself
","Its gotten to the point where superhero franchises are trying to re- invent themselves with each iteration, and 'Thor:Ragnarok' is a case in point. Directed by Taika Waititi to the excesses and extremes of goofiness, 'Thor Ragnarok' doubles down on the sitcomish fluff of its 2nd middle sibling big brother movie 'Thor Dark World'. The movie actually suffers on a binge of humor, certainly an over-parody of its excellent origin installment. Some of the humor works and some of it wears thin, especially the sarcasm. The effects are gorgeous to behold, but there is, like other recent Marevel sequels, an amp-up in humor at a cost in gravitas and weight of story. Its no easy task to find the balance or happy medium for directors and Waititi turns on the proverbial fire-hose to the point where the rest of the story feels perfunctory. One last thing, there is no place for Willy Wonka or Led Zepplin riffs as messy overlaps in tone and poor choices for music. 6/10 mixed",6,9,20,3 November 2017
Zodiac," Long, uninvolved, dry
","Slow, uninvolved, and unemotional, Zodiac goes on much too long at 2 and a half hours. The movie seems like 2 dull movies wrapped into one movie - (spoiler) first one being the cops trying desperately to adapt to the crazed media-loving killer, and the second one with the Gyllanthal character going on his own sleuth trail. Neither storyline builds any kind of suspense. It's more of a poor docudrama. This was what was happening at the time let's recreate the mystery....and the production seems to do a fair enough job at it. The director may have put in a painstaking amount of time on research, but nothing pulls you in - it's looking at events like reading a Encyclopedia - there's no shades of emotion or interesting character development. The actors all do a satisfactory job, but nothing above average.... So not really recommended at all. Only interesting thing was coincidentally that the settings were all identifiable to my hometown areas.",5,1,5,7 February 2009
Milk," Somewhat Interesting but Slow
","It's evident that some time and passion has been put into the movie 'Milk'. It delves into some important issues and milestones for gay rights, however, the movie moves at what seems a slugs pace. I fell asleep on the initial watch and had to revisit back to midway to watch again. The character Harvey Milk in the movie is interesting, driven, and determined, but the story has an awful lot of empty protest scenes. There's really little insightful or stirring when watching video of protests - it's always a bunch of people screaming about something and a bore. The debates were portrayed at least were more interesting. Also the movie, admirably gives the religious arguments their share of time endeavoring to show a more historically accurate-type context. Acting was pretty good, and for especially Penn deservedly wins an Oscar. He shows a lot of poured energy into his character and real life activist.",6,1,4,17 May 2009
The Terminator," Dated Music But Still Good
","'The Terminator' is director James Cameron's big ticket into the world of film, and rightfully so. He's put together an interesting, partly paranoid, gritty survival Sci-Fi Action mesh that ought to be rated highly given the apparent modest budget. While lead actress Linda Hamilton's gives a soft and maybe somewhat uneven performance, Cameron scores largely due to choosing Schwarzenegger for the lead villain. An article states Cameron was against casting Arnold initially, but the planned rejection-meeting changed and reversed his mind, and the rest is history. The action in the movie fairly competent. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the back-story which is a great setup and give the movie some depth. Rewatching it, I hadn't seen in it in 15 years, but it is still a good watch minus the scene-cutover music which doesn't stand the test of time and makes and dates it sounding circus- like and cartoonish. You can forgive this though. Note Michael Biehn does solid job in supporting role. Recommended Sci-Fi, and certainly for Arnie fans -- 7/10.",7,0,4,15 April 2017
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Weaker Story/Villains than the Original, doesn't make it to the original's level
","I was pleasantly surprised by the original Hellboy a few years ago, and so I was eager to watch it's sequel hoping for another fun experience. The original was more involving and sharper focused with Human beings and paranormal agents had much better dynamics. However, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army falls a bit short. The overall story seems like conjured from a 3rd grader, lacking any depth. There was a feeble attempt at making the villain half-way noble as well as a stupid gimmicky twin sister and side-romance that bored. None of it was really explained - mostly glossed over escapading from one visual CGI background/character to the next. And the finale scenes were too run-of-the-mill and overlong, with actually the CGI sort of spotty sometimes in the movie. At times the movie felt like it was ripping off from Men in Black and Harry Potter. (Spoilers) There was a semi-interesting new paranormal agent - a German Spectre, and a comical long sequence with beer involving he and Hellboy fighting to help give the movie a pulse. I liked the inventive goggles too seeing the paranormal. Many of the Visuals (spoiler) particularly in the Troll Market were competent and wonderfully grotesque. But the movie needed a better framework, story, and villain - Overall it was somewhat disappointing compared to the original - if not OK. Probably worth a watch if you liked the original - just doesn't break new ground or quite make it as involving.",6,2,5,31 August 2008
Ready Player One," Spielberg, Make Your Own Movie
","'Ready Player One', a book adaptation taken up by renowned director Steven Spielberg has too much hack in it to be a great movie. I understand its a video-game smorgasbord, from a book, but the rip-offs and references are gratuitous and obsessive. Misplaced and overused music littered the runtime - I mean Twisted Sister? Please. Ripping off from Excalibur spell chant? Terminator - blah Directors and film companies, unless making sequels really ought to leave older movies alone. The hacks aren't all poor luckily, the Shining homage is well done and entertaining. Still its not enough to make for a good movie 6/10 Mixed",6,1,3,28 July 2018
Dear John," Too Many Problems
","'Dear John' directed by Lasse Holstrom is a poor effort with a bunch of different problems. (Spoilers) Neither Channing nor Sieyfried are very good, and the direction doesn't help either. Sieyried looks too young the part, and an older more mature actress would've improved this minor problem. They sometimes sleepwalk through scenes, but that's not the main problem. The main issue is the cruddy Music Video Cuts that occur at least in 20 min of the movie. We've seen this in too many movies of late - it's a lazy out for directors who don't want to spend the time to hash out good dialog or real scenes. Here, it's over-indulged like food to a glutton. These scenes are wash-overs, contributing little if anything, and they last too long. Something else, watching letter writing scenes with narration doesn't work - it's b-o-r-i-n-g and should've been cut. Actor Richard Jenkins has a good supporting part in the movie but is underwritten. And the last 3rd of the movie doesn't work, it feels like the filmmakers want to create some sort of fairy- tale scenario - it wasn't at all believable.. Yes, There's just too many problems - and it's a poor movie for it. Can't recommend - 4/10",4,0,1,10 August 2013
Crash," Awful brainless script in attempt at provocation; schmaltz
","I had high hopes for this movie, but it quickly degenerates into a mess. First off, filmmakers if you're reading, STOP WITH THE SINGLE FEMALE (or male) SOLO SINGING SOUNDTRACKS MASQUERADING AS Provocative; its cheap, fake, and obviously placed! It knocked down Lord of the Rings, and Man on Fire. It is a disgrace to cinema. There's no provocation or emotion just a pure cop-out....'Let's make this image spiritual by stamping it with solo singing.' The effect distracts and detracts from the images!! Trying to create some sort of emotional connection is pathetically contrived. Its complete pretentiousness and lack of creativity. Most of these stories are contrived with un-intelligence to the nth degree.......About 90% of the script depicts some sort of racial friction, as if that's all the characters ever think about....do you want to continually get bombarded with preoccupation with racial lines of all characters contrived as 100% confused ethnocentric and then each character with near religious experiences showing how ignorant each is? This movie is awful in how the characters are so contrived as puppets for the writers. Totally unbelievable and shallow. The best cast in the world could not save this picture which is to say the cast did a pretty good job despite the garbage they had to spew out.",3,5,12,12 September 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Gratuitous violence/setting, dull characters detract from story
","Pan's Labyrinth is particularly graphic it its violence - surely gratuitous- having a repulsive affect. Viewing people being shot different ways and multiple times or tortured for the sake of show is not entertainment. Neither is the sadism and the brutality of one of the main characters - a Captain in the Spanish military. However the backdrop (yes backdrop) story or fairy tale is well depicted and conceived and twisted in an almost Burton-like way. One of the lead fairy tale creatures is a definite rip-off from 'The Cat's Eye' troll (with Drew Barrymore), but that's OK. Too bad the setting/war completely ruins any wonder or art related to the fairytale. The fairytale itself lifts the movie as best it can, but with so much senselessness and a boring lead character with little charm coming off a little dull, the movie suffers. Keeping the fairytale as a base and some rework could've done justice. It ultimately and sadly is lost on the potential the fairytale cant reach.",6,2,5,27 June 2007
Alien," Top Science Fiction Movie
","It doesn't get any better for science fiction fans than Alien. Along with Blade Runner, this is one of the best science fiction movies and along with the Shining one of the best horror movies out there. It transcends either genre by combining the two. Both cast and direction are simple, effective, and focused. The set designs are a standard in themselves mimicked by 10's of other movies, and borrowed often. The violence is well placed and not over-done or glorified. Explanations are well thought out and suspense is also top-notch. The conception and implementation of the creature itself still beats the CGI of today over 25 years later. I might have enjoyed a little bit more exploration or implications on the crashed/abandoned ship, to understand the ship's origins, but thats part of the fun anyway, leaving it up to the viewer. This movie deserves full recommendation and would be must for any fan of the genres. Enjoy the mystery, horror, suspense, and futuristic exploration of Alien.",10,1,3,30 July 2005
Horrible Bosses," Vulgar and Unfunny
","A truly awful movie with no wit, full of vulgar contrived humor, we couldn't even finish half of 'Horrible Bosses' out from the library. The wife and I started watching it and she got up at about the 15 min mark, and I stayed another 10 min. What was the first 25 min composed of? 3 men enduring phony, ludicrous, and unreasonable episodes with their bosses or work environments, and then getting together at a bar to discuss it. To compare it to 'Office Space' would be offensive to those involved with Office Space (Aniston completely shameless in choosing this new filth). I'm not really sure it deserves a review, or even how IMDb'er can fill up 10 lines when reviewing this brainless potty-humored, crass, juvenile schlock. Thus really writing this as a warning of how not to waste your time. Put it this way, the part of 'Horrible Bosses' we watched was worse than a lot of current Adam Sandler movies. And What is Donald Sutherland doing in this drivel too? Loss of reason. Stay away.",2,4,8,9 December 2011
Black Mass," Good Performances but Ho-Hum, and a bit disappointing
","(spoilers) I was expecting a bit more from director Scott Cooper's 'Black Mass'. It is repetitive in a poor way - featuring murder scene, dialog/exposition, repeat again and again. It hides under real events rather than illuminating them. Acting is satisfactory, but by the end of the movie it didn't matter. The movie was a mild bore. Moreover Johnny Depp's performance is decent, but overrated, and the screenplay is unoriginal - this is no 'Goodfellas'. There is little surprising, interesting, or fresh; and the movie just ends on an epilogue note. The production design, sets, and editing were pretty good but the violence was gratuitous and also repetitive - so altogther a little disappointing, but maybe worth one watch. 6/10",6,1,2,12 March 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Standard Fare
","In this ongoing movie era of superhero movie after superhero movies, its getting more and more difficult for a movie (especially superhero types) to stand-out as excellent. Take this Captain America sequel - 'Captain American Winter Soldier' - it has an interesting sub-story with Captain America and his former friend turned adversary. However the movie can't escape the clich√©d quips and standard humor, or the dumb video-game styles that are supposed to be captivating. In an early scene, you have Nick Fury character talking to his Silverado Chevy and the armor 'value' percentage counting down as sun-glassed thug extras shoot up his car. This is the kind of dull, unimaginative fluff which might interest a young 12 year old boy, but fails in yet another superhero movie. Robert Redford admirably trying to wave the acting flag still....Give it 6/10",6,2,5,7 May 2014
Interstellar," Awful Accompanying Music
","It's not too often that I hold my recommendation for a movie based on its music, but sadly for 'Interstellar', directed by Christopher Nolan this was the case. The music in a good deal of the movie is so grating and batty that I could not concentrate on the movie-watching, a total distraction and disappointment. It was like a crazed clown playing chord sets on an organ. Had the music been not so obtrusive I would've given the movie a 7/10. It runs too long and needed to be edited down especially at the beginning. The movie is not lacking ambition, and Nolan endeavors to deal with interesting science fiction and science phenomena. McConaughey has been in the better 'Contact' years ago, so is no stranger to science fiction. Hathaway tones down her role while Michael Caine's character is quite annoying - (spoiler) his death bed gibberish monologue was incoherent and difficult to understand. Mixed 6/10",6,0,5,17 December 2014
Pacific Rim," Entertaining but Overlong and Superficial
","So let's take some 21st-century Godzilla-type Monsters with large Robotech-esque Machines and build a disaster movie around it. That's what director Guillermo del Toro has done in his loud, colorful, and action- packed update called 'Pacific Rim'. It is reminiscent of the much older 'Independence Day' in the same shallow feel which isn't a compliment. Toro Super-sizes the effects and action, while the script is superficial and forced much of the time. Still the huge bravado is captivating and colorful in several scenes, entertaining enough to help you forget the boring interludes. There's too much filler scenes though that are not really well acted or scripted, and the asia-phile-ness is on full display too in excess. In short it's overlong by 15 min, and could've been leaner. This is a fan-boy movie, though it does have a few good bits of humor. Mildly Recommend, and worthy of a theater watching for the spectacle. 6/10",6,0,3,22 August 2013
Empire of the Sun," Large-scale, grand, occasionally poignant but listless and overlong
","Decided to re-watch this movie as I hadn't seen it in a good 10 years at least. It is difficult to rate. It's obviously had some time and research put into it, and is grand-scale in budget and setting, but I thought it dragged and was curiously weak of energy. Christain Bale's debut is pretty good as a bratty kid thrust into survival and the earlier scenes of Shanghai were epic to be sure, but the prison camp felt like prison to watch. I enjoyed his desperation in the early parts of having to take care of himself. John Malkovich adds some depth with his shrewd survivalist character who befriends the boy. The movie becomes bogged down in slow pace and could've used some better editing perhaps. The actors at times don't feel too engaging either. Still it has some grand scenes and settings - along with an army of extras which it make it feel more authentic. There's probably a reason why I didn't remember it well - it doesn't quite hit the mark. Look for a young Ben Stiller as an American prisoner in the latter half of the movie!",6,6,11,31 December 2005
Lion," Should've Won Best Picture 2016
","What an extraordinary story and movie 'Lion' was, directed by Garth Davis. I caught this on a flight recently and it had been high on my list to watch. I was a bit worried as I had high expectations for it, but it hit them and then some. I absolutely loved the young actor Sunny Pawar. Together with Garth Davis, Pawar is the center of the movie - a firecracker of a younger sibling, the first 40 min of the film are especially well shot. Davis and his camera crew on location in India have captured the lives of laboring work and plight of children with urgency. I have no idea how this film did not get Best Picture of 2016. The cast were top notch, and the story-telling simple and powerful. Locations and contrasts were marvelous, as well as social dynamics. 9/10 and highly recommended.",9,0,3,28 April 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Bit Contrived but Casey Affleck comes off Interesting
","The Afflecks have teamed together on a full blown project that isn't too bad. It seems to stretch thin plausibility for the sake of 'entertainment' twisting and turning it's way through a plot. There were quite a few character actions that didn't make much sense (spoiler) for instance, someone diving off a 40 foot cliff in water at night time not knowing how deep it was, or busting into a house with gun-fire coming out of it. Preposterous. However the acting in the movie seems satisfactory. Casey Affleck shows he can act maybe even better than his older brother. Towards the end though, questions seemed posed for the sake of controversy rather than natural resolution. And way, way too much swearing - left and right, up and down...sourly bad. Mixed review maybe worth a rental or better yet pick it up at the library.",6,0,2,22 January 2010
Ant-Man," Ant-Man is Ant-Fun
","Caught Marvels Studios newer 'Ant-Man' today off Redbox, and was happy with the experience. Although it starts off a bit slowly and drops into clich√© on occasion, it picks up well. Director Peyton Reed has cut a good balance of adventure, action, and comedy. Paul Rudd looks to have physically prepared for his big part and pulls it off OK though a maybe a bit blandly. The SFX were very good, and I liked all the ant varieties on display. One can't help but compare to :Honey I Shrunk the Kids', which was marvelous and trailblazing in its own right, this was more frenetic and energetic. And it was a good watch. (Spoilers) The bug-zapper was priceless. Recommended 7/10.",7,2,5,17 December 2015
American Hustle," Overlong and Overrated
","(spoilers)Directed by David O Russell, 'American Hustle' does not warrant the apparent acclaim it's been afforded critically. It is a parade of look-at-me characters/actors set in the 70's some of whom seem terribly cast. Before going into that, the real problem was the movie dragged especially in overdone scenes with Bale and Adams in the beginning and Cooper and Adams later on. How many scenes do you need to 'convince' us that these two are soul-mates or she's conning. Likewise how many stupid yelling matches do we need to endure with any 2 sets of characters. There is too much screaming, yelling, and name- calling. Then there is those who were miscast: Jennifer Lawrence is way too young to be a naggy wife as is Jeremy Renner as a Mayor of New Jersey town. Renner doesn't come close to coming off as a East Coaster. Anyway, what is good is some of the dialog and Chrisitian Bale's once again complete metamorphosis as a New York conman. I also liked the inside clever ice-fishing joke, as well as the representative music and costumes. A mild recommend though ridiculous as an Oscar selection. 6/10",6,6,11,19 January 2014
Incendies," Very Good Until Becoming Too Contrived
","'Incendies' is one of these movies that really disappoints - The ones that for a good portion of the movie are highly enthralling, but then comes crashing down. (Major Spoiler) I had an inkling that the filmmakers might pull what they ended up trying to smear on the viewer, and it was so, so disappointing. Suffice it to say to twist the plot around and pretzel it like they did, the filmmakers stooped to utter contrivance. They blew up logic and believability for the sake of sensationalism. How probable could all of this actually take place in such a sequence (?), quite improbable. Additionally I had a hard time understanding what exactly transformed the mother into a killer(?) The ending became marginal and a continuation of the contrivance. Too bad - it had a great story going up until the last quarter of it's run-time.",6,16,33,8 October 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," More Bourne....
","It has been awhile since I'd seen the first of this set - but I recall liking it fairly well. The 2nd film Supremacy I hadn't seen until very recently, and I didn't think it was as good as the first, but fair - this movie, The Bource Ultimatum feels pretty much like a retread of the 2nd film only with some generally excellent action sequences and better pacing - especially the whole Morocco run-through (except the actual fight scene being overlong). Despite some great action scenes, the movie features some poorly done flash-backs, a bit of a letdown ending, and some ridiculousness in terms of believability of surviving both a car-bomb and a high speed car wreck (but that's the spy genre I suppose). Also the makings of a new gf/love-interest seemed a bit platonic. Nonetheless this movie get's closer to the original and is better than the 2nd (Supremecy) imo. It's a good movie overall.",7,1,3,6 October 2007
Nightcrawler," Excellent Look at Sociopathy
","One of the better movies of 2014, Dan Gilroys 'NightCrawler' succeeds nicely. It is fairly simple linear story bolstered by strong direction, a superior performance by Jake Gyllanthal, and great supporting acting from Rene Russo, Rick Garcia, and Bill Paxton. At the core, the writing for Gyllanthal slimy character is superb. It paints a pathetic, base, immoral, and mentally ill sociopath bent at nothing to gain money and power. We've seen these kinds of stories before where a character will stop at nothing to attain something he or she desires. Indeed the storyline is retrodden, but Gyllanthal and Director/Writer Gilroy have hit their marks so well, that the clich√© doesn't matter. Gyllanthals' ultra polite verbosity and rapid fire cadence are dead on and worth the watch. Renee Russo's news director's character is layered and sympathetic, Bill Paxon lends a newsy chipper demeanor as a competitor. The movie had solid camera work and music to add. It stretches believability sometimes but is nonetheless a great watch. 8/10",8,1,1,15 March 2015
Oblivion," Slow, Plot OK, Settings/Future EnVisioned Well Done
","(Spoilers) Directed by John Kosinski, 'Oblivion' is a visually beautiful film that has some drawbacks. For me the main drawbacks, were - 1. Casting Tom Cruise. He doesn't fit the character role very well imo. 2. The pacing of the movie sometimes lagged. 3. The choice of the director to indulge too much mindless run-of-the-mill action scenes with weaponry. This may have been called for in the story, but perhaps editing/rework would've helped. Despite these issues and even a few implausibilities the movie still was interesting and engaging. Both lead female actresses Olga Kuralynko and Andrea Riseborough did well and looked fabulous on screen. I'm sure others have already compared 'Oblivion' to the better 'Moon', a decidedly Science Fiction movie. This story certainly grabs from it, but not in a bad way. The visuals and flying were captivating, and the narrative serviceable. Overall, admittedly I liked it more than not. It salvaged enough of a back-story to augment the visuals, although that sounds backwards. Still Give it about a 6.5/10. And must mention last, the music was pretty good too.",6,3,5,26 May 2013
Burn After Reading," Starts slow but goofily entertaining
","Overall I liked 'Burn After Reading'. Some of the performances, notably Brad Pitt, really pulled the movie up from being a bore. The movie suffers from meandering for about the first 30 min or so where little seems to happen, and the characters seem somewhat uninteresting. Once the storyline picks up and the main conflict and motivation of the movie come into play the movie gets much better. This is in no small part to pretty much every scene between Frances McDormand and Pitt being fun. Being a satire, the Cohen brothers do a pretty good job putting together sharply defined characters in the meld of 'Fargo'. However this movie doesn't have as strong a plot/storyline. Despite that, lightly recommend it as an evening dinner flick or like such.",6,1,3,24 August 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Overcooked, Overstylized, and Overrated
","I remember not being too impressed with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', although in hindsight, it's quite a bit better than it's bloated and all-over-the-place sequels. On recent rewatch, my original feelings were validated. General Observations: First of all without Ian Mckellan, this trilogy would've been completely deep-sunk; Mckellan's performance single-handedly saves scene after scene that he is cast in. Despite that, Peter Jackson bombards with music of grandeur left and right. Directors in general need to understand oversaturation and it's pitfalls - all of the Lord of the Rings movies drown in choirs or orchestra music. Do we need to have maximum audio for every single frame? It's over-indulgence in audio - it's trying to smear meaning on every image, and it creates a phony feeling. Likewise, the imagery in this movie is hit and miss. Costuming is more-or-less competent, but the CGI is less so. Running around in the Mines of Moria (sp?) you get a feeling of cut-outs. Realize that the dialog comes from a book, but you don't have to be supremely faithful to source material - some of the actors have with difficulty with the locution of the dialog. Anyway, don't think I wantto rewatch and review the sequels - it'd be a waste of time. This trilogy is overrated.",5,2,7,27 December 2010
21," Pretty Good Story, but with bland support and poor middle
","'21' reportedly inspired by real events has pretty good pull and storyline. The leads in the movie of Sturgess and Kevin Spacey do a respectable job keeping the picture afloat. However (spoilers), the rest of the 'team' and development for supporting actors is underdeveloped and unremarkable. They become cut-outs in the background - almost stick figures. Worst of all is Bosworth who may be a better actress than this role provides, but is utterly uninteresting and unbelievable as MIT brainiac, and playing the love-interest blandly. Lawrence Fishbourne in a guest-starring role gives the movie a bit of depth and validity while the finale scene(s) are foregone conclusions and predictable as are a lot of the happenings the simple drive of the story works and is entertaining. This is something akin to 'Rounders' but not quite as good. The middle third or so of the movie feels empty nonetheless as edits show too many boring Vegas parties and lavishings devoid of meaning or fire. Finally The narration is satisfactory as well as the ending, so Overall mildly recommended if you like gambling.",6,0,1,26 September 2009
Knowing," Tries it's best, but poor Development and Acting
","'Knowing' starts out interestingly for about the first 25 min of it's runtime or so, and has some finale fireworks as a big spectacle. Too bad the meat of the movie is more or less vapid. The story doesn't dig deep enough - it's under-developed and ultimately superficial. Applying logic to a fantasy/apocalyptic movie is sort of a contradiction in terms, but the movie needs some heavy thought and editing obviously. For instance (SPOILERS) a completely ludicrous scene of Cage running toward a newly crashed airliner staring at burning people and exploding engines while not saying a word is beyond far-fetched. Or how about the cob-webbed clich√© of characters deciding to go to dark spooky places during night-time...why?...Just because. And What really did it for me was the use of 'EE', as if those who communicate in the future must be able to text on their blackberry's and iphones. This movie has some interesting premises, but needs better script and dialog as well as acting. I liked Rose Byrne in WickerPark, but she's pretty poor in this movie - and that seems more on the director and script than she herself. Nicholas Cage is pretty much going through the motions while both child-actors seem to be reading from a script-board off-camera. The finale scenes showed some interesting imagery and creativity - not enough to save the ridiculous and dullness that preceded it. Maybe worth a rental for the effort. Nice try....",5,1,3,7 September 2009
The Shining," One of the Best Horror's in Cinema
","Stanley Kubrick's adaptation for Stephen King's 'The Shining' is at least a top 3 Horror movie for the genre. It features some truly chilling and scary moments for movie history. (Major Spoiler) Two of my favorite were: the revelation when Wendy Torrence comes upon the writing, 'All work and no play makes Jack a Dull Boy' confirming Jack's insanity, and the deal Jack has with the Grady ghost which frees Jack Torrence upon his word that he will be murdering ('correcting') them. The real element that molds this movie is a terrifically creepy soundtrack replete with creepy and lurking thematic music throughout. Combine that with strange Hotel decor, and the murders and histories of the past - and Kubrick achieves spookiness. The ending is marvelous, and the photography stunning. The performances by especially Nicholson and Shelly are first rate. I generally am not a big Horror fan as it is certainly difficult to take most horror movies seriously, but this gem of a production is different. It is one of Kubricks better movies, and a fabulous production.",9,0,1,25 November 2011
Salt," Implausibilities to a Fault
","More or less an Angelina Jolie vehicle, 'Salt' is a mild disappointment as the action and combat scenes break the barrier of plausibility. I'm willing to throw out some logic, but Jolie as a bomb technician, hand-to-hand killer, and (spoiler) apparently also a flying-squirrel down an elevator shaft stretches any plausibility. The action is more-or-less high paced, but needs to be much smarter. A climactic fight becomes laughable with a supposed computer program controlling a nuclear arsenal taking a full 15 min to authorize is clunky and dodgy. We hear an awful female voice counting down, cheesy beyond belief, as bad as movies decades ago. One of the bright spots of the movie is the support performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor bringing some a solid grounding for a movie needing it. Mixed review at best.",5,4,7,29 August 2010
Disturbia," Intense Beginning turns mindless and clich√©d
","About 1/3 through Disturbia, the movie completely becomes clich√©d poorly made teen slasher flick fare. It's too bad too since it began with such promise, the first 20 min or so which were pretty well done in drawing us in to what mightve been a good story. Unfortunately, the writers, editors, and movie-makers take the path well traveled or in this case VERY well traveled. They have a combustive type prologue setting up what could've been a great character fall-from-grace or look at house arrest or 'you-fill-in-the-blank', but no.... It degenerates into standard dumb predictable situations trying to pass as suspenseful. Any character insights or quirks are left on the back-burner or simply unimportant And then the movie screams teen angst/slasher flick , and finally 'the girl-next-door film' pops up that we've seen 2 dozen times before for good measure. So the hard-earned setup is flatly disappointing. Completely dumbed down.",4,0,1,30 March 2008
Ender's Game," Mild Disappointment Due to Mid Portion
","(spoilers)Directed by Gavin Hood from an adapted novel written by Orson Scott Card,'Enders Game' started out fairly well and ended even better, but throughout much of the movie runtime is a snoozer. Scene-after-scene of training followed by gruff, slow, aging Ford yacking and sympathetic Davis wore thin. The training seemed to be the focus of the movie and becomes feeble and clich√É¬© when measured against the aliens themselves and interaction with them which deserved much more coverage. Too much is made of Ender being genius and lethal - much too repetitive. And of course the class bully and training bully are both thrown in. The insect race while not terribly original are well conceived and deserved better. This movie may be adapted from a novel, and I don't know how much it leverages from it, but it needed rework. Harrsion Ford ought to retire too, while the child actors were average, to be expected. 5/10",5,0,4,1 December 2013
Dunkirk," Visually Stirring with Nolan Panache
","(spoilers) Reminding us of his labyrinthine layering more from Inception in story-telling, Director Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk' tackles a sub- story from WWII, and well succeeds. The movie is competent, and a bit muted in dialog which seems fairly commonplace in the War genre. The music though and score has undertones of Chariots of Fire all over it, as does the feel of this recent reported labor of love. Occasionally the music overstayed its welcome but other than that the movie was quite good. Mark Rylance may be up for an Oscar with his work here, Supporting or Lead. His performance stands out as sort a throwback of your parent, grand or great grand-parent of the era. It's great storytelling with a look on the chaotic nature of War and Survival without relying too much on violence. Recommended and 8/10.",8,2,6,21 July 2017
Ratatouille," Better than expected....
","This Pixar production is a lot of fun. I enjoyed myself at least as much as The Incredibles. The story is very good, and the gags are littered throughout. My favorite recurring one being anything with the rat-like resident 4ft chef who get's the boot. His paranoia and antics remind one of loony-toons in good touch. Once again Pixar outdo themselves with fabulous fur and texturing, and vivid colors of Paris and the inner city, and dynamic motion. Voice acting may not be quite as good as in productions past, but it's good nonetheless. Peter-O-Toole is unmistakable in his pronounced English accent. Looking forward to the next movie called Wall-E. Check it out on DVD, well worth it.",8,1,3,14 October 2007
Aliens," One of the best....
","Aliens is probably the best sci-fi/horror/action movie combination made to date. Its pacing is near perfection with great acting all around from the Sigourney Weaver down to extras. It has the right blend of action, suspense, and horror never overdoing it. It never strays from its focus and constantly involves the viewer in the outer-world futuristic atmosphere. The production design, like Alien is fabulous once again - with FX still well done by today's standards - this goes as a case in point of how live puppetry, modeling, and costuming with a lot of attention to detail easily outdoes today's CGI which is while nice to look at - doesn't bring the same level of realism. Any fan has seen Aliens more than 10x at least. People who rate this against its predecessor are missing the point, that both are equally effective movies while the subsequent movies (Alien 3, Alien Resurrection) are poor and jumbled with effects\acting going downhill. Its no wonder either since Alien and Aliens were directed by Scott and Cameron respectively - tops in the business. Aliens is not for the easily scared - it is an intense viewing experience giving it muster, energy, and force. I'm happy to have it in my collection, and enjoy revisiting it from time-to-time.If you haven't seen this movie and enjoy action, suspense, science-fiction, and horror treat yourself to this creme-de-la-creme, it wont disappoint.",10,0,0,30 July 2005
Now You See Me," Title Should Clue You In
","Against my better judgment (what with such a bad title), I saw a cheap showing of this movie, and woe is me for not heeding my gut-feeling - it was a complete waste of my time. Directed (atrociously) by Louis Leterrier, 'Now You See Me' is the worst movie I've seen in theater since 'Australia'. It is has no characterizations, a vapid and ridiculous story, and video-game editing and content. There is so much babbling and incoherence from scene-to-scene, you keep having the feeling as if you've just walked in on a movie in the middle of the movie the WHOLE MOVIE. Most of the 'magic-show' scenes are like watching bad television reality shows. Dialog is juvenile as is the supposed romances. You could care less about any and all of the characters. This is a steaming turd of a movie - so far the worst of 2013. I wish I had rent it to be able to have turned it off early-on. 2.5/10",3,3,6,28 June 2013
Enchanted," Good Comedy w/ some Original Elements and Good Performances
","I went into Enchanted with no knowledge of what the movie was about and was pleasantly surprised. Thanks in large part to James Marsden, Timothy Spall, and Amy Adams - this movie takes off. Especially for about the first 2/3 of the movie, the movie makes for a clever mix of fairy tale vs. real world logic. And a hilarious clash of naivety and chivalrous antics. (spoiler) Favorite scene was the apartment cleaning (in New York) as well. There's plenty of physical humor and the dialog and script are very well written. There are plenty of chuckles, and for me the movie was at its best when concentrating on the comedy. Some minor things that didn't work or wore out as the movie went on: the chipmunk (Pip) and the final 15 min with Susan Surandon as the evil queen who wasn't given much to work with in her defense. Anyhow this movie manages a high level of entertainment, and gets extra merits for it's energy and original elements.",7,0,1,10 January 2008
Flashdance," At Least It's 80s
","Re-watched Flashdance recently and felt compelled to write a bit on this early 80s dud. Every time it seems I re-watch this movie it gets worse and worse as I recognize how trite and pathetic the cardboard story and dialog is. It doesn't hold up as a good movie in today's cinema. There's a bare bones plot about following one's dreams, but essentially the movie is about 45min of story and 45min of MTV-style cuts. Jennifer Beals is energetic and certainly in outstanding shape for her quasi-interesting dance machines, but her acting and more to the point the movie's script is dirt poor and woefully dated. The final number featuring the theme song showed a stand-in and stunt double plopped in for almost half the number. Can't recommend - but maybe - for nostalgia's sake. Check out Saturday Night Fever for a better nostalgia trip.",4,1,3,30 December 2011
Quantum of Solace," James Bourne movie is a clone but still decent
","Despite my disappointment that the Bond Franchise is becoming more and more like Jason Bourne movies and less and less like the good old days, I'll recommend this movie. It is very well edited and some great international locales. (Spoilers)It also moves at a sharp pace and features a 2/3 of the way through stunning plane chase scene. Compared to the first Daniel Craig Bond outing, the movie smartly dumps some of the so-called obligatory drama and includes some of the old one-liner quips. Yes they've made Bond a lethal remorseless killing machine and taken most of the suave humor which made the old standbys so re-watchable. (Big Spoiler) How remorseless? At one point Bond uses his trusted friend as a human shield - really tasteless....anyway. This new sleek movie runs a brisk 1:40 min and seems over before you know it. The villains here seemed a bit better than last outing as was the Bond Girl a heck of a lot attractive than Casino Royales. It's a decent improvement from the last installment. Hopefully some decisions will be made to bring back more humor.",7,2,4,11 January 2009
Legends of the Fall," Overlong Brad Pitt-Mobile w/ some Great Photography
","I can remember 'Legends of the Fall' coming out during the mid-90s and thinking to give it a pass in the theater. Almost a decade and a half later watching it on DVD, I'm glad I did. While not a complete turkey, this movie suffers from an overlong run-time, and the director's camera is magnetized on a younger up-and-coming Pitt to a fault. More than that though, there's too much angst and forced turmoil in the story, that was as subtle as a broad sword clanging on the floor - and top that off with strings/orchestra interlude music ad nauseum. The final epilogue was a waste and not needed. However, there were some redeeming qualities in the movie, for instance, the photography, costuming, and set design were well crafted, and the cast as a whole do a serviceable job. I score it as mixed/tepid.",5,4,7,13 November 2010
District 9," Horrible Main Character/ Well Conceptualized Aliens - Mixed Bag
","After good word of mouth from work and a sky-high average vote, decided to check out 'District 9' in the theater. Overall it was a mild disappointment given the expectations. Went in knowing very little. Starting out what really bothered foremost was an absolutely grating, idiotic protagonist dumbed down and really single-handedly written as to almost sink the picture. He doesn't think, wails and complains, and mixes what sounded like Australian and Dutch accents on his English all while cussing feverishly. Acting isn't the problem here as newcomer Shalto Copely acts his heart out, but the writing is a joke as writers throw logic and reason to the way-side in exchange for shoot-em-up action and foolishness. Ever watch really bad horror movies where cheesy characters do ridiculously thoughtless things? Well you get that here unfortunately too. Had the protagonist been created more cerebral instead of such a twit the movie would've made it to at least solid footing. It has a fabulous alien concept and rendering as well as a decent plot. Minor grumbles include how one-track the 'evil weapons' corporation was, the now heavily heavily clich√©d in all types of movies single female voice singing screaming 'drama', and the use of 'News and Interviews' as sort of a pseudo-documentary which frankly detracts and distracts from story-telling. District 9 had potential to make it to much greater heights as a lot of effort and thought has obviously been put into details of effects, locations, costumes, dialects, languages and sociology of what's going on. It's executed marvelously. But At it's core it's too much of a violent shoot-em running amok - rewriting is needed. Worth a watch though for the spectacle of it all.",6,1,3,30 September 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Fleecing Bloatfest
","Agreed to watch this with a friend who treated. I felt bad that he covered me for this 160 min bloatfest. It's computer generated imagery is mostly poor, and worse, it is excessively long with too much dialog. It effectively fleeces audiences along with it's prior and future brethren- movies. This 'Adventure' has shamelessly been broken into 3 movies, when a single movie could easily suffice. I have not read the original book content, but the movie has a scant few visually excellent scenes that can't save all the blue screened backgrounds, running around, and video- game action scenes with orc after orc. (Major Spoilers) Only Redeeming scenes are with Gandolf engaging Sarin, and the mountain furnaces being turned on with the dragon. That's maybe 15 min of runtime. Orcs have become old and tiresome. Can't recommend 5.5/10",5,3,5,30 December 2013
Batman Begins," Newer and Better Batman
","The original Batman in 1989 is the only one of that series that holds any weight. With each successive iteration, the movies got worse and worse. That is until last year when I saw this redefining version which was better than all its predecessors - even the original by a some. The cast features some of the best actors out there including Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkerson, and Michael Caine. Christain Bale was decent choice for Bruce Wayne as well. The film does a good job of getting at the roots of the cape - crusader. It has a good story with the requisite chase scenes and combat. There is a lot of character background hence the title.If anything it needed a more involved villain, or at least more screen-time for scarecrow. Also Katie Holmes doesn't really cut it - she's too homely. But these are rather minor grumbles. The film packs in action, emotion, and a great look. It leaves all the fluffy humor of the Burton series out as well as the zaniness which gave the first films sort of a circus-like atmosphere. In fairness, they seemed to be more like the television series. This film however redefines the series and emboldens it. Looking forward to the next movie. Worth the purchase.",8,0,2,24 June 2006
Bridesmaids," Fairly Entertaining
","While not up to the level of 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' as what I thought was the best comedy of 2011, 'Bridesmaids' comes in 2nd. I enjoyed the poking fun at the absurdity of weddings more from a woman's perspective - needy and superficial. The gags are hit-and-miss as was the dialog. On the whole, there are quite a few snickers, but would've liked a few more belly laughs. Kristin Wig puts herself on full display and is billed as one of the writers in this satire. Melissa McCarthy fills in for a female 'Chris Farley' type performance replete with ample physical humor. The ending petered out a little bit as is often the case in the genre, but the film supplied some good entertainment. Recommended",7,2,4,25 November 2011
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Good but Expectations Too High
","A friend had my expectations too high by stating that he enjoyed this sequel equal to the original. After watching I can't quite agree, although I liked this 2nd movie, it did not have (nor could it achieve) the inner-feel and genuineness of the initial story development. The original How to Train Your Dragon core development 30 to 40 min is as good an animated entertainment as I've ever seen, so would be difficult to match to say anything of surpass. Where this sequel did surpass the original though was in it's even better animation texturing, movement, colors, and details. (major spoilers) Main problem here though, I thought the mother character seemed kind of thrown in, forced, and almost gimmicky. Too much focus was on her too. Might've been better not making her related. Still a good watch - 7/10",7,2,7,27 July 2014
The Favourite," Snakepit
","*spoilers* If you're one for mean-spiritedness, you'll probably enjoy 'The Favorite', directed pretty well by Yorgos Lanthimos. The antics, heathenism, and gluttony are on full display, and can be entertaining in many stretches though curiously gets tiresome at times, watching selfish or power-hungry debutant tit-for-tats over and over (think 'Looney Tunes'). It does have a story-arc that becomes apparent quickly, but the characters in the movie are loathsome on the whole. Lanthimos makes sure every character is infected with some type of sin or debasement. Had heard of extreme excess in high nobility during tours of castles before, and this brought back memories of those discussions. Rachel Weisz plays villainous characters better than she does other types. And here we have a juxtaposition being brewed up of the 2 main characters over the runtime. I was reminded of the better French film, 'Ridicule' while watching this - check that movie out if you liked Favorite and don't mind sub-titles. This movie was an entertaining watch too. 7/10 Recommended.",7,4,5,9 March 2019
Gone Girl," Loses it Towards the End
","I had high expectations for 'Gone Girl' due to word-of-mouth, but sadly they weren't really met. This movie has some core problems and is a mixed bag. On the one hand the direction is good, and the acting fairly good, but on the other, the story is a mess and the dialog and chemistry often unsupportable. The movie runs a long feeling 2 hr 25 min and the preponderance of media embedded in the story feels like a nuisance and is annoying. Director David Fincher, who has done both worse and better work seems to have a good idea of what he wants from his camera - editing and picture- work are very good as is the music. Though Affleck and Pike are individually pretty good, their early scenes together do not ring genuine often thanks to far- fetched or clich√©-ridden dialog, and late in the movie the story has degenerated so badly that the dialog has little meaning in the final scenes. Indeed the the last 25 min has failed the story. The concept was there, but it got swept away. The resolution was unbelievable and awful. 6/10 for the first 4/5 of the movie despite sometimes poor dialog, but with good points for moody music. Mixed.",6,0,2,20 February 2015
Drive," Sometimes Visceral, but overuse and misplaced Music problematic
","In what felt like a mix of Risky Business-esque Soundtrack meets Goodfellas-type violence, the movie 'Drive' was a bit of a disappointment. The movie amps up the graphic violence and blood to grotesque and gratuitous degree. The effect is jolting and disgusting. And while the soundtrack is often good, some of the picks and the frequency of music-video cuts is way too indulged in by director Nicholas Winding Refn. As I've written before in other reviews, Music is very important in movies, and so is the right type and usage. It's a very personal choice and reaction for each viewer. For me, Some movies succeed without it, but I think the best movies also include novel and enhancing music in the right way. 'Risky Business' has sensational music fitting it's content. 'Drive' has about I'd guess almost a third to half it's runtime with some music track running. The moody synthesizer and electronic blues are good mixes but not the other cut female vocals. They are whiny and distracting. The dialog of the movie is sparse throughout although the gangsters motor-on with requisite obscenities. The director, tiringly frames Gosling as almost a fashion model constantly changing angles and overusing facial close-ups. What is to like though is a lot of the driving shots and chase scenes. They are very well shot and edited. Pan-in and night shots are beautiful Still this movie is a mild disappointment and a mixed rating for me, moody and visceral at times, but over-indulgent with it's soundtrack at others.",6,2,5,29 November 2011
Insidious," Possibly Best Horror Film since 'The Others'
","With a high average rating here on IMDb, thought to catch 'Insidious' sooner rather than later. And I must say I enjoyed the show. It does a lot with an obvious thin budget. It succeeds I believe on a couple of strengths - not getting too gory, having an interesting and a bit sci-fi- ish concept, and very good makeup and great use of music. While the movie could've done better with set designs, and I grew a bit tired of the inside of houses, I thought all the actors were satisfactory and Lin Shaye as the paranormal lead was very good. (spoilers) I guess I would've liked to see the story hashed out a little better - the last third was when it finally started moving nicely - maybe a longer runtime could've helped and more use and description of 'astral-travel'. Nonetheless recommended for horror fans, and it's high average is merited rightly at 7/10.",7,0,1,9 July 2011
Peaceful Warrior," Despite Nolte, a Stale Fortune Cookie
","You quickly realize when you're watching 'Peaceful Warrior' that you're getting into what amounts to many poorly written scenes, and a lot of teeny college student-type frivolity. The good parts of this movie solely revolve around Nick Nolte gracing the movie with his acting power lifting the movie from utter dud to passable. I didn't care much for the main character nor all the melodrama that surrounded him with either young women or his fellow gymnasts. In fact Scott Mechlowicz grated pretty well. The motorcycle accident afforded little empathy for his situation seeing as how brainless it was to begin with. And his emotional acting out was pathetic. However is 'training' scenes away from the gym were entertaining and Nolte a kick as Zen Buddhist mentor, yet this movie cant even match the likes of the Karate Kid formula, a movie that had the right touches of romance, humor, and teenage development - a better and comparable movie.",5,2,3,12 April 2010
The Number 23," The Number Awful
","A humongous steaming pile of dung, 'the number 23' is a truly awful movie. It is as convoluted as it is contrived causing any astute viewer to wonder where on earth his robbed time has gone. This movie stars Jim Carrey venturing into thriller material but ending up tainting an already dumb weak-minded premise - the same premise that causes people to believe in all that they hear in horoscopes with every inch of faith. Virginia Madson who has been in some good projects in the past, has picked a true stinker to latch onto unfortunately. *spoiler* The movie starts out boring for the first 3rd starts to pick up a bit and then ventures into the absurd and finally tries to wrap it up nice and tidily for the unwitting audience. Filmmakers please edit your own awful stories before bringing to picture. Unrecommended waste of time.",3,2,5,30 July 2009
Ghost Rider," Exceeded my Expectations
","Caught this on DVD for the first time after avoiding it in the theater and I was pleasantly surprise. I thought the story was pretty good, and the cgi competent on the whole with some very stylish color and looks. (spoiler) Also the final fight was very well visualized with Legion. Nicholas Cage does an decent job in the title role and Eva Mendes plays pretty much herself every time - satisfactorily. I especially enjoyed the 2 main fallen angels who let it go just a bit over-the-top and definitely Sam Elliot who fit his part outstandingly - better supporting actors than leads and that definitely helps. (spoiler) A couple of things they might've changed - raising the difficulty in vanquishing the lesser devils and some parts of the CGI needed cleaning up, but Ghost Rider is actually a stronger comic-book/super-hero movie probably because I knew nothing of the storyline going into it and a fresh story. Worth watching.",7,4,5,1 August 2008
The Lives of Others," A Pillar of Movie-Making
","Truly a masterpiece of film-making in recent years, The Lives of Others has 1st-rate writing, dialog, and characters under a wonderful historically contextualized support framework. As a viewer, this is like unwrapping 2 surprise gifts in one package that complement one another. One being I enjoyed the re-creation of the later-aged communist bloc and two being the characters of government and society who inhabited them - most especially, the lead Stasi played by Ulrich Muhe , whose own character's growth and metamorphosis through the length of the film is emblematic of the plight of the state. Brilliantly done. We go from despising him to understanding and finally empathizing with him. Direction is first class and focused and the cast is determined and full of energy. This is truly an example of how good a movie can strive and it's awards and acclaim are highly merited.",10,3,4,7 November 2009
Room," Solidly Executed
","(spoilers) Directed with competence and subtlety by Lenny Abrahamson, 'Room' is winning direction with good score and great acting from leads, especially Jacob Tremblay (young Jack). The claustrophobia of the first 45 min wears a bit, but the filmmakers redeem themselves with an excellent 2nd half of adaptation and re-circulation into society. Camera angles, brightness, and blurriness, including sound muffling are all masterfully distorted and adjusted to impart the strange distress the boy gets put through when transitioning. The dialog is not far-fetched or pandering. Indeed, the movie was very good, adapted from the novel with the same author creating the screenplay as well. 7.5/10 (recommended)",7,1,4,4 March 2016
I Am Legend," Pretty Bad, not sure what Will Smith was thinking
","Saw a free sneak preview of I AM LEGEND - so the price was right. (Spoilers) Despite some touching parts with Will Smith and his German Shepard early on, this movie suffers from a lack of focus and generally poor pacing. There's a lot of silence and dead-weight scenes to 'convince' us of his solitude, too many. But to top it off, the CGI of animals and creatures is BADLY done. Often you could perceive the zombies/animals as, well, rendered! Detractively unconvincing really. In fact without Smith, the project would go straight to video - not really sure what he saw in it. He does a pretty good job as sort of a psychologically worn out military scientist. The last quarter of the movie seems thrown together though. The movie might've done better just focusing on the moments leading up to the spread of the virus. At any event, I'd avoid paying money to see it in the theater - maybe worth a rental for Will Smith fans. Mixed - close to a dud with some redeeming scenes.",5,13,29,9 December 2007
Gran Torino," Eastwood does well but spotty Support
","The first half of Gran Torino grated in a bad way. How many more contrived scenes with racial slurs and name calling can story-tellers come up with - it began to remind of Crash unfortunately. Luckily the movie pulls out of it midway to develop an interesting story-line with grumpy-old-racist Wally and his Hmong neighbors. Eastwood is pretty much Oscar-the-Grouch for the whole movie, and the humor is dryly funny at first, but it wears pretty thin after repetition. I didn't think too highly of support acting from the brother Tao and especially the sister Sue , but they deserve a bit of slack being first-timers I suppose. Also, why do lead characters need to die to bring more meaning to things? Awfully clich√©d - Wally doesn't need to die. Eastwood is good as Wally - though dry, sarcastic, angry. So it's a mixed bag I thought. If you're an Eastwood fan, you might enjoy it.",6,4,7,14 March 2009
The Illusionist," Well done romance, camaraderie, mystery mix even if predictable
","I very much enjoyed this movie - especially Giamotti and Norton who both kept the interest level very well. They're 2 of the more likable and talented actors around, and the movie met and slightly exceeded my expectations - although I knew nothing of the story beforehand. I liked the plot and storyline even though the mystery was plainly given-way to the audience. Overall it was a good romance masquerading as a mystery. Biel did a decent job - satisfactorily. The costumes, settings, and backdrops were great, and the dialogue plausible and smoothly enduring of another time period while not trying to be too out-of-date. The movie runs a brisk runtime and seamlessly tells a story in a non-linear fashion. I most enjoyed the Giamotti character who had the most development (SPOILER) - and in the end has us sharing in his delight. Yes the ending although maybe not surprising is still quite enjoyable.",8,0,1,11 January 2007
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Imaginative, Magical Story and Animation filled with Wonder
","Who says animation cant be serious? One of the older entries, Nausicaa develops a wonderful insect and human world in a mix of medieval and early industrial societies along with the strange and wonderful jungles and creatures that inhabit it. Yes, don't let the fact that it was originally made in '84 deter you, this is a fantastic story of wonder and splendor. Especially interesting were the observations and descriptions of the jungle and how the pollution has perverted the plants and yet still manages to cleanse. Indeed, I found all the jungle particularly captivating and vibrant. Characters were fine if not standard. Some of the overlapping themes for subsequent movies was laid down here particularly cautions of pollution and war. Flying scenes were also spectacular, and who can forget the Ohmu - sort of the fantastic representation for nature. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind deserves it's place amongst all other Miyazaki films as a superior fable. I've always liked Tottoro best , but this one strikes a bit more serious note and is well worth seeing - recommended.",8,0,1,7 November 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Novel Idea, slow winding Narrative with Decent Acting
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button runs an overlong 167 min and unfortunately starts to feel it's runtime in effect losing pull towards the end, but the pacing and storyline for the 1st half of the movie are still very-good. Around the 2/3 point though there aren't too many questions left unanswered and the story has the hasty additions of characters and acceleration of time. The humor is here and there, but vacant mostly when Benjamin grows into middle age. The best performance by far is by Taraji P Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother who stands head-and-shoulders above most of the cast including the leads. Brad Pitt's character is mostly aloof and unemotional, but self effacing in a way similar to Tom Hanks Forrest Gump. The love story mostly feels obligatory but has some interesting moments such as some of the later dialog. Cate Blanchett does a good job, bringing in a bit more emotions. Early scenes within the care-home and during Benjamin's first 20 years were much more interesting making it overall a solid outing with high marks for the novelty and performances. Music too is sometimes very good and moody fitting well.",7,2,5,14 February 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Funny and Zany but suffers from ADD
","This movie was like watching or feeling a bout of massive mania. It is completely manic - which makes for non-stop energy and quite a few giggles, chuckles, and even a few guffaws, but the filmmakers perhaps cut too much in the editing. A lot of movies and even animations likely don't cut enough, however 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' never slows even slightly. Scenes are thrown together rapid fire - and you're never really able to collect your thoughts or enjoy the laughs. There were quite a few nifty ideas and zany off-the-wall events; the pure energy of the movie is remarkable - some reasonable pauses would've been greatly appreciated.",6,9,15,5 February 2010
Garden State," Aloof and Disinsteresting for the most part
","This movie seems to be a lot like the main character - aloof and detached. It fails to really involve emotionally save for the last couple of scenes. I never felt the lead actor really cared for Sam. He seems removed from the part and the movie suffers from it. He spouts out words at the end, but there's little save any emotion. The soundtrack was at times annoying and misplaced with made-for-TV special folksy singing. Ian Holm is virtually a ghost in his role as father and that relationship seems pretty unbelievable. This could be a case where the writer/director might've benefited from not being the lead and instead directing a different actor to allow for him to make better judgments and editing. If the numbing emotions are intended it makes it far too common and rather boring. Overall was lacking in strength and emotional pull.",6,2,4,5 January 2006
Big Hero 6," Too Sentimental and Repetitive
","(possible spoilers) I had heard good things about 'Big Hero 6' from a friend who reported to like the movie a lot, so I had fairly high expectations for it going in - maybe too high. The movie opens up strongly, but got a little too sentimental and melodramatic about a quarter through on. It does have some cute humor reminiscent of live action robot movies like 'Short Circuit' that was worth some chuckles, and a couple harder laughs. The 'action' though gets repetitive and the story seemed a little stale around half-way, certainly 'losing steam' in the 2nd half. The villain shrouded in mystery could've been done better and differently I think also. Still the movie is probably worthy of a watch. 6.5/10 - Mildly recommended.",6,19,66,6 December 2014
The Imitation Game," Good Direction and Great Acting
","Justifiable Oscar contender directed solidly by Morten Tyldum, 'The Imitation Game' is certainly one of the best movies I've seen for 2014. The whole cast gives above-average to excellent performances and the story has an interesting tri-temporal settings with past, present, and future looks interspersing and weaving nicely throughout. While the social problems are nothing new and commonplace, the strength of the movie is the captivating historical context and circumstances of how the code-breakers figured out the German cipher and enigma code. Mark Strong deserves supporting Oscar considerations, as does Cumberbatch and director Tyldum. I would not be surprised if it wins multiple Oscars. Represented. 8/10",8,4,10,28 December 2014
Jurassic World," Shameless Money Grab
","Certainly one the worst big-budget movies this year, 'Jurassic World' is recycled, rehashed and devoid of intelligence. I can't recall the other predecessor movies (Jurassic Park and it's mediocre to poor sequels) even as bad as this pond scum. The product placement is gratiutious and shameful. - Mercedes, Coca-cola, Imax etc....There is bloat-scenes all over the place - pure filler fat. The lack of intelligence of this movie is remarkable considering the its budget. Dialog is utterly PG tepid. Scene after scene of stink with inane fighting supposedly of security men skirmishing with predators. Half- hearted limp character development fizzles out within the first 20 min. Steer clear, not worth your time - a total dud 3/10",3,1,5,20 November 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Some fun visuals - decent remake
","This remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory pretty much plays it safe, so there's little new here. To compare it to the original would leave it a step below, especially in the musical numbers and the pull of the main characters. Freddy Highmore and David Kelly are decent. Willy Wonka as sort of a child-adult here comes across pretty flat and unnecessarily grotesquely androgynous. What's the point? Anyway despite that, the factory looks interesting and there were some ingenious placings of the Umpa Lumpas. Particularly liked the strange scene in the jungle where Wonka recalls meeting Umpa Lumpas and bringing them back. So, is it worth owning? Not really, I'd pass. It'd be worth viewing if you like fantasies or enjoy the original.",6,0,1,12 November 2005
Prisoners," Strong Effort; Reminiscent to'Winters Bone'
","Watching the trailer on 'Prisoners', I was convinced it was gonna be big fat clich√© and dud, but while it does have some of the storyline and suspense we're used to and maybe even clich√©d, I surprisingly enjoyed the movie thanks to some excellent performances especially by Hugh Jackman and Melissa Leo, and some slick cinematography and editing. The director, Dennis Villeneuve has put together a serviceable story with infused emotions and great settings. The closest movie I can think of that has a kindred spirit to this is 'Winters Bone'. Both rely heavily on hostile and dark woodsy settings. The mystery comes together fair enough, but the actors take this movie up to a solid 7/10. Recommended.",7,0,0,26 January 2014
Logan," Subject of Aging
","This seems to be the trend in movies these days where actors who are calling it quits or who are hanging up a role are getting their encores. Take director James Mangold's 'Logan' which he also wrote. This movie is certainly a vehicle for Hugh Jackman, who has been in no less than half- a-dozen superhero movies at least. It was likely written specifically for him. Mangold smartly has made his super-heroes mortal and given his story more gravitas. The story feels like a variation of what we've seen before, but the subject of aging and death is right out in the open. It's a fresh and mostly honest look for a Super-hero movie, although the violence is explicitly graphic and maybe could've used a bit of a tone- down. Jackman, Stewart, and young Keen are a capable bunch to watch. The results are good. Recommended 7/10",7,2,7,18 April 2017
The Dark Knight," Mildly Disappointing Sequel; overlong dialog, less involving,
","My expectation for Batman: The Dark Knight, the 2nd of the newer, sleeker installments was probably a little high mostly due to the word of mouth of co-workers/friends calling it better than/ as good as Batman Begins. Unfortunately I didn't think so. There is an awful lot of jockeying and expository dialog - too much - testing my patience. The media reported 'Oscar-Worthy' performance by Ledger, while good, is not fantastic. He is only sporadically on the screen. It follows, the movie I think suffers from the film-makers trying to develop several story lines at once. The Joker should've been focused on more - (spoiler) instead we have the Joker, love triangle weirdness, and Harvey Dent villain development. Also, what is with Christian Bale's raspy (I'm masking my voice) line delivery when in the suit - detracting and awful. A fan of the original 89 movie, I'd also like to add both of the lead females in these newer Batman movies really don't bring the class and presence of Basinger from the original - they are the girl next door - Gyllanthal is a good actress but is not a fit in this movie imo (maybe even less so than Holmes in Batman Begins),... anyway.....,Interlaced were a great locale skyline/scene in Hong Kong, and about 2/3 of the way through a superior chase scene delivering (spoiler!) the most exhilarating moment technically in the movie - the tank transformation. There was some great final dialog by the Joker delivered to Batman too - For me these were badly needed elements, but few between. Also we have a less interesting/less imaginative crises - (spoiler) bomb hostages vs. weird kooky interesting hallucinogen idea in Begins. I was hoping for more 'wow' moments, but instead got more hand-to-hand combat and rapid-fire expository dialog - ho-hum - Some editing and recasting could've done this movie some good. Mixed review, with several entertaining scenes trying to break out of the mold....",6,11,21,28 August 2008
Into the Wild," Brilliant Photography, interesting story, very POOR music
","I doubt most people made a fuss about this; had non-obstructive music been chosen for this film, it would've been a much better movie. As it is, it's a compelling narrative with exceedingly colorful photography and some excellent stop-motion interspersed. Characters of the film seem plausible, simple, and down-to-earth. The lead character 'Alex SuperTramp' is stubbornly determined. Also Dialog was succinct, sometimes poignant....and actual narration expository. However It's becoming more and more disappointing to declare movies problematic due to music. Not all the music in Into the Wild was gratingly irritating, but many of the interlude cuts were totally subtractive. The last thing I wanna hear is MTV-type framed folksy stylized singing littering over a film like bad garbage. At least half a dozen interludes were interlaced with it - enough of a problem that the fast-forward was button got used. Why cant directors, stick to real dialog? Or employ music as an enhancement rather than a forced interpretation. Melodies during motion pictures are fouled by lyrics - these aren't commercials!! Anyway, somewhat of a letdown for how good it should've been minus the music cut-overs.",7,1,4,9 December 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," Pretty Good
","Once upon a Time in America is a better than average character-driven epic with its strength actually going to the child actor portion of the film. To note, I watched the 229min version which admittedly at times plodded a little bit. Nonetheless I enjoyed the younger boys in their trouble-making and growing up very much. It was a good evolution of mishievousness changing into crime and mayhem. The relationships between the lead boys and then later Woods and Deniro helped pillar the movie. The violence was at times more than needed unfortunately (or fortunately if you like that kind of thing) - note an overlong rape seen which dragged on in poor taste. Music also became repetitive. Nonetheless the setting and characters were well developed and realized, definitely worth a rental especially if you like crime/gangster movies.",7,0,3,13 August 2005
Taken," Great Pacing and Action
","Probably one of the best movies in awhile and certainly the best action movie in a year or two, Taken is a lean and exhilarating movie that sets itself up very well. Liam Neeson is first rate and mostly believable as 'Preventor' Mills. Director Pierre Morel sets up the characters and situation with the right amount of time, depth, and history to give us something to latch on to. Then, the movie launches and it really launches. It's going full speed for at least 50 min or 2/3 of it's runtime. The action and fight scenes rival the best of today's movies including Bourne and James Bond. (spoiler) You have to suspend belief a little bit with a late 50's Neeson taking on 8 younger men in a room, but that's about where it ends. Taken has great focus and direction and is a highly effective action movie, one of the best in recent memory. Recommended.",7,1,2,15 March 2009
The World's Fastest Indian," Wonderful Odyssey
","The Worlds Fastest Indian is a wonderful story. It captures some excellent racing photography out in the Bonneville Salt Flats while keeping a high interest level and empathy for the main character Burt Monroe, a true life enthusiast played chipper by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins turns in the kind of performance we expect. His character is full of life and humor taking setbacks in stride and not shy about calling on others for help. There's a nice character setup of him in a town in New Zealand before his adventure begins trying gather himself and preserve his adventurous spirit. Along the way supporting cast members to a good job, and the production does a good job of keeping settings looking like the 1960s. The finale sequence is captures the excitement and expansiveness of the events. Music throughout support decently. Well worth a watch.",8,1,1,24 August 2008
Avatar," Outstanding Effects Light Up Simple Story
","Avatar is indeed the most visually spectacular and colorful cinematic experience created to date - it's visual spectacle emboldens a fairly simple, pedestrian, and maybe even somewhat clich√©d storyline. I'm sure there's umpteen posts that re-iterate the story as sort of a detraction or weakness in the movie, but it still works satisfactorily. Probably the only part of the movie that was hit or miss for me was the score and musical choices. I'm a traditionalist with music and score - enjoying orchestras and symphonies over song and beats. Anyway the visual achievement is so stunning it probably makes it a Best Picture Winner and deservedly so - the story only need be satisfactory and not impede.",8,1,2,27 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Better than I'd Expected
","Checked 'Drag Me to Hell' out from the library expecting a cheese-fest, but was pleasantly surprised to find a serviceable story within a fairly well-done horror. The acting overall is satisfactory, not great - but what were you expecting with such a bad title(?). While the movie's story seems to be a variant of those seen before, the horror and scares depicted are often competently put together. (spoiler) The only scene I thought was way over-the-top was the car-fight scene. Yes the car-fight had a stamp of Raimi about it, but I guess you cant help your innate tendencies as a director in whatever you're doing. Both Lohman and Long are OK co-Stars, but may be better suited for supporting leads as evidenced in better prior movies. Enjoyed the Ending. Recommended for the Horror genre definitely.",6,0,0,25 March 2011
The Artist," Excellent Period Homage
","Sort of Reminiscent of the way 'Chicago' won it's Oscar for Broadway musicals, directors' Michel Hazanavisius 'The Artist' comes through for the classic silent genre. In the art and entertainment world what better way to entertain than to produce a quality throw back. It works in music and it certainly worked for this gem of a production, thanks especially to best actor Dujardin whose energy and expressiveness carries the movie magnificently.(spoiler) Even without dialog, the score and music fill in nicely, and the nostalgia and period is warmly present. I also enjoyed the scenes with the dog. What a great way to bring back a connection with the past.",8,2,4,3 March 2012
Sinister," So-so Movie but Decent Horror
","(Major Spoilers) Bad Movies (especially in horror) rely on dim-witted, dumb, or ridiculously stubborn characters to make their plots work, and unfortunately 'Sinister' fits this category wholly. Truly great horror movies (Shining/Omen/Jaws etc) are great in part because the characters in the stories do not need to be rock-dumb or stubborn to help the story along. Storywriter/director Derrickson doesn't seem to understand this. The movie borrows heavily from 'Ringu' and some from 'The Ninth Gate'. It is sufficiently foreboding and atmospheric, and has clever ideas and execution. It is not ridiculously gruesome either but implies it. There is potential for the filmmakers to make an excellent movie and classic horror, but there's too much fall-back to the traps of clich√©. This one's a missed opportunity. 6/10",6,0,1,22 February 2014
Up," Fairly Good
","This new entry into the Pixar vault admittedly doesn't make it to the level of animation or fun of some of it's Pixar predecessors but it gives a good time nonetheless, and tries it's best. It's by no means a bad movie, but the story wasn't focused enough - what is the point of the movie? - pieces of information sort of patched together - what does the movie want say thematically - the movie has trouble flowing or connecting well. This isn't meant to be a huge criticism, and it's not to say it's not entertaining. 'Up' has some genuinely funny moments (especially with the dog collars and whole dog scenes). The Russel character wear's thin sometimes contrasted with moments with 'Kevin' that are interesting, alive, and well paced. 'Up', as with any pixar movie is worth a look, but in a baseball analogy it's a double instead of a home-run.",7,0,1,11 July 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Delving into the Mayhem and Minds of Hoodlums
","This movie is a romp. At more than 35 yrs old, it superiorly stands the test of time. It's story offers a masterful center character and great supporting characters throughout. Direction and camera-work are top notch. The lingo and conversations are wonderfully strange and bizarre spoken in British-dialect English - they give a cleverly added layer of different time and place. Clearly much thought is weighed on subjects of crime, punishment, and reform as central themes, but the motivation and drive of the story is an immersion into the hooligan mindset - an anarchy against societal rules and etiquette in total disregard of the government and fellow citizens. Questions are posed of age old punishments vs. new-wave reformations. Kubrick and the screenwriter have crafted the feel of mischief and mayhem better than any other movie to date imo. Malcolm McDowell's devilishly wanton character is the quintessential 'bad apple', and wonderful to follow with expository narration. Great use of music as well. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,6 May 2008
How to Train Your Dragon," The best animated movie since Wall-E
",I remembered hearing my cousin stating how much she enjoyed this movie in the Spring-time upon it's release. Feel sorry I missed it's outing in the theater. It is a gem of a production - better than Toy Story 3 or Despicable Me. 'How to Train Your Dragon' captures the magic that any good live-action movie has done in the past with animals. It is masterfully put together with a great balance of humor and adventure. The dragon training scenes and friendship alone is worth watching the movie - the other core characters and story are just 'icing on the cake'. I just hope they leave it alone for sequels. Great movies do not need them.,9,2,3,13 February 2011
Total Recall," Good Sci-fi Action - probably Arnold's best imo
","I remember absolutely loving this movie the summer it came out when in high school. In fact I snook in to see it at least 4 x in the theater more than any other film in the theater. It is well-paced, graphically violent, with gratuitous nudity and excellent visual effects - top notch during the time and still fun to watch. The story is of course an Arnold vehicle but I enjoyed the Science-Fiction aspect of reality versus dreaming. Of course upon viewing it nowadays it doesn't have quite the flare and panache that made it so huge the summer of '90, but still you can pick it up dirt cheap at WalMart. There are many Arnold movies - but this one seemed the best done imo with the intriguing storyline, fun cast, indicative of the energy on the screen; and it is still fun to sit back and watch every so often. A must for Arnold fans....'See you at the Party Rictor!'",8,0,1,11 March 2006
Limitless," Fun Drug-Trippy Fantasy
","Directed by Neil Burger, 'Limitless' offers fast pacing and solid entertainment for it's runtime. It is slickly edited and delves into the drug-world adeptly. (spoiler) It is chiefly a fantasy, but I thought the characters and thus storytellers fell pretty short in creating worthwhile goals given the kinds of powers they were in-stating or describing. (spoiler) The Bradley Cooper character can use huge amounts of his brain power, but what does he use it for? Running for the US Presidency, and his own selfish purposes (?)....that's a bit shallow. Anyway while I thought the filmmakers thematically could've made better endpoints, their cast and direction is a glossy fun picture with excellent cues, great narration, and quick-witted dialog. Overall Recommended.",7,1,1,8 October 2011
Inside Man," Interesting Story, editing, but sometimes poor dialogue, music
","Overall I enjoyed this film for #1 especially not indulging in ultra-violence as well as it's charades and antics reminiscent of The Thomas Crown Affair a it. It's strengths far outweigh the few problems that I felt were minor - one of which was some of the dialogue. For instance some of the racial banter and pretentious movie homages ('ever seen Dog-Day-Afternoons') throw-ins were out of place. Then I thought Jodie Foster looked completely out of her element in trying to portray immoral uppity behaivor. She looked sort of uncomfortable. Also the music sometimes didn't mesh well in some scenes. However, thanks to Clive Owen and Christopher Plummer for anchoring; so the movie kept the interest level up. Denzel Washington was a little bit toned done - but still entertaining. The editing was good, and directors know to leave narration to the English....always the safe and good bet - well done by Owen. I'm a pretty big fan of narration kept concise. This was a good movie, not quite worth the buy imo, but the rental for sure.",7,1,2,27 August 2006
Jack Reacher," Best Tom Cruise Movie in Awhile
","For the better part of the last decade, Tom Cruise in his personal life and publicity has effectively casted a pall over his professional movie career. Admittedly, I had my doubts going into watching 'Jack Reacher' that it would be too much Cruise in a bad way, but director and writer Christoper McQuarrie does a great job with Cruise, harnessing the cockiness we've seen and loved before, without getting too narcissistic. It's a fine line. The movie has a good set of icy-cold villains as well to boot. They are well conceived and played well by Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney. The movie also has some well choreographed fight scenes to add to the action. Some solid entertainment and recommended.",7,4,10,13 April 2013
Les Mis√©rables," Great Songs/ Poor Singing
","I remember seeing a professional theater company put-on 'Les Miserables' in the early 90s. It was a romp of a performance and production. The music numbers came back to life with the movie. This new movie lit up my memory, and although I commend the actors for giving their best in singing, none of them save Amanda Seyfried are very good. So what does that suggest? Well, here is a musical without good singing, so it's not really recommended. The production was enhanced fairly competently by computer generated backgrounds, and I especially liked the introductory scenes, however as I'm sure is already noted, the movie runs and runs and...it feels like 180 min vice 150. Anyway, if you liked the play, this may be worth a watch and listen, despite it's execution, to judge for yourself.",5,1,1,14 October 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Polished Fluff
","(spoilers) Unfocused and overlong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 suffers a bit from writer's burnout, and the clich√É¬©d sequel's curse. It's pretty difficult to duplicate original magic in Cinema of big hits and so this one follows the pattern. It has an overindulgence in 70s and 80s soundtrack which gets tiresome. While it has a few clever bits of humor with Groot, David Haselhoff and Pacman , it lacks a focused coherent story that the original possessed, and feels like fragmented occurrences. And while the original was a preferred 66/33 mix of seriousness/humor this sequel reverses the mix - and the seriousness and pathos comes too little too late. It's not a bad movie but it doesn't make it to its predecessor's entertainment level and is a tiresome retread. Only toward the last 15 min does it gain some pathos it sorely lacks for the first 100 min or so. 5.5/10 - Mixed to poor.",5,2,5,25 August 2017
Thor," Met Expectations
","A couple of friends had reported liking this movie, and I finally caught it on a plane ride home. 'Thor', directed by Kenneth Branaugh' makes the cut pretty well - it's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously in places which is important for Comic Book movies. (spoiler) For instance a wonderful Bar-Scene with 'Thor' having drinks with an earth-scientist. The story is well thought out and interesting and the lead, Chris Hemsworth does a fantastic job with a witty, well written script. Indeed his dialog and speeches are close to Shakespearean-like. The special-effects are enhancing and mostly competent. The earthlings played by Portman and company are satisfactory if uninspiring. The movie reminds one of the original Superman movie in good ways with father and son relationship, and a beckoning to 'magic'. Pretty enjoyable.",8,0,0,1 September 2011
Castle in the Sky," Great anime - one of the better Miyazaki's
",Had the chance to see 'Castle in the Sky' - Tenku no shiro Rapyuta is excellent animation and one of the stronger entries for the Miyazaki productions. It has as usual excellent color and motion in the classic anime style. Especially enjoyed the flight to the castle and the early discoveries of the garden with the robot gardeners with grass growing on them. The pirates made good sidekicks; one thing I noticed was we were never really shown the bad guy/relative falling or dying - I guess it was assumed. I rate this anime right on par with Naussica....Tottoro will always be my favorite followed by Spirited Away. This one is not far behind though. Looking forward to seeing the remaining Miyazaki films I haven't seen.,8,2,3,22 October 2005
The Fountain," Imaginative but jumbled; perhaps needs more than 90min...
","The Fountain is imaginative and distinctive in it's look, and features vigorous acting from Hugh Jackman. It reminded me of something like a 'good' version of 'The Cell'. Unfortunately, The Fountain at times feels like it's trying to cram in 3 movies into one 90 min session. Without any foreknowledge of what the story is, it took some 15-20 min to come to grips with the maker's reality or narrative.... Not too good for me, tried my patience. There is a pretty clear message of a cyclical meaning in life and death - they support one another and are linked. However, for me, whenever religion, faith, or spirituality permeate into explanations, it's a bit of let-down. I'm one more for reasoning and logic. Going back to medieval Spain with inquisitors and dark ages type setting is interesting as narrative, but not as an explanation really. Another thing is because of all the jumping around, I never quite empathized with the main 2 characters - they don't get much of a chance to develop, but rather are thrown onto us. Still the look is vivid and dreamlike - the filmmakers at least dared to make something less clich√©d even though jumbled.",6,1,3,13 July 2007
Zombieland," One of the Better Movies Recently
","'Zombieland' is a movie that knows not to take itself too seriously. It strikes up a great tone of humor, gore, and camaraderie. And while the gore is definitely gratuitous, the humor mostly works, (major spoiler) despite a strange Bill Murray cameo that sorta works, but feels out of place. (spoiler)Early on, easily the best scene in the movie involves the Hostess truck and Woody Harrleson having a fit. That guffaw alone made the movie worthwhile. As with most zombie movies, there's a lot of aimlessness and solitude for the characters, and indeed toward the end, not much has happened, but the filmmakers know this movie about entertainment and not a great or introspective story. Refreshing to see a movie play well within it's own framework.",7,0,0,13 November 2010
The Departed," OK movie, good acting, but Best Picture? No, and fizzles out at the end
","This movie has good performances from many of the leads, especially Dicaprio and Nicholson, but it's no-where near a best picture. The last 10 minutes or so got pretty ridiculous considered how long the movie dragged on. Yes it's supposed to be an epic crime yarn, but let's just have one more main character whacked for good measure at the end to make it a bloody mess literally. It's convoluted poorly - the ending knocked it down a bit. This is not Good-Fellas which was a better movie with better characters and more interesting from the social point of supposed crime and gangsters. Instead of a crime drama, The Departed is in essence a double cat and mouse game that feels overlong. Anyway, editing might've done the movie well. The side plot romance also was too much of a plot device. Anyway, a bit disappointing. Finished review....now, Last year's Crash showed how fickle and utterly poor the Academy's selecting is...The Departed as Best Picture is further proof that the Academy are lemmings giving-way to political tendencies rather than merit. In hindsight after seeing most of the candidates, Letters from Iwo Jima probably had the most merit. Anyway, if you like any of the lead actors, maybe worth a viewing.",6,2,5,12 July 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Serious and Stoic
","By the numbers and in the vein of her former Oscar winner 'The Hurt Locker', Kathlyn Bigelow's barren 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a serial account of major events relating to the State sanctioned terrorist killing of Usama Bin Laden. The movie stars a relentless Jessica Chastain as Maya in an emotionally taut story of her crusade and job to hunt-down and kill terrorist targets; it succeeds in imparting a claustrophobic feeling of base work space, as well as barren or impoverished settings. From hearsay the story was related to the book, 'No Easy Day', a recount of the Navy Seal Mission that enacted the killing in Pakistan by a former Seal. Thirty's climax is that fight, which keeps to the Seal's description of what transpired faithfully. However, there is no joy and a constant drain and strain on all the characters psyche evidenced in the departure of Co-Star's Jason Clarke's character Dan, and especially in the beginning with gruesome scenes of interrogation. The experience is certainly not dull, and there's a docudrama feel to it - like Bigelow is trying to keep close to her source material. 7/10 Deserves a recommendation.",7,0,3,13 April 2013
Crazy Heart," Focused, Well-Acted Story of Recovery
","'Crazy Heart' is one of the better movies of 2009 thanks to the usual winning combination of great writing, acting, and directing. Jeff Bridges is fully deserving of his Oscar Award, believable as ever as a complete alcoholic trying to latch onto something with meaning in his broken down life. With his character, the road-weary country-star Bad Blake, you can tell he's put in loads of practice time at performance including singing and playing guitar, and it comes off heartily genuine. Especially wonderful for me were the first 20 minutes or so of the movie before the main storyline picked up, I thoroughly enjoyed his actions and reactions to the Midwest town-folk - and his almost aversion to getting up on stage while inebriated. I thought supporting cast members all were better than satisfactory as well, this movie is very much worth a look if you like dramas.",8,6,8,3 April 2010
War of the Worlds," Moronic, stupid, and implausible...utter crpola!
","This movie is woeful. It has nothing interesting or intelligent to say save for the design and look of the aliens/and their machinery. There are so many implausibilities, the movie becomes an instant fast-forward fest - from the beginnings of the way crowds act/react unbelievably, to the cars all parting out of the way for the characters easy access, to their van magically surviving a plane crash, to the ridiculous action, thoughts, and dialogue of main characters and side characters - screaming on cue and acting on instant emotions - really poor all around. Or the coincidences riddled throughout. And how about some mindless violence from strange invaders? We wont explain any of the reasoning or development - we'll just wash it all down with some Morgan Freeman narration. Besides the first 15-20 minutes or so, I must've watched the next hour and a half in 25 min....that's how much fast-forward got used. This is nothing more than a spin on terrible disaster movies only with less creativity, editing, and forethought. Even the corny original had its merits - this is just a loaf on a stick....",3,4,6,1 December 2005
12 Years a Slave," Competently Produced, Directed, and Acted
","Saw this movie today on a plane and learned it won the Oscar during the same evening at the time of this writing. Although it wouldn't have been my choice for Oscar, it is worthy of the award. I was prepared for the brutality, almost over-prepared, as I thought it would be akin to Schindler's List, but it is a much different movie. I noticed Chiwetel Ejiofor in 'Serendipity' a while ago, and it's good to see him in a meaningful movie doing an excellent acting job. He acts his character as dignified yet confused and vulnerable, and still hopeful. Director McQueen also deserves praise for attention to detail. Being almost 150 years since Slavery's abolition, the oldest person in the world is still likely 2 generations removed from it. There is no-one left to give 1st person accounts of it. This story helps to try to bring it front and center to remind us that it was real and a bold stain on America's young History. Indeed Slavery's roots though are much older. (spoiler) The graphic lashing scene conjured up thoughts of Roman times and protected barbarism. From the story, you can see how many wretched, greedy, ignorant and uneducated people might have truly indulged in the diseased power of it, and likewise the rampant fear as a result. I liked the depth that the movie brought the abuse to light. 8/10",8,0,3,2 March 2014
30 Days of Night," Overall Lacks Intelligence
","While not a complete dud, 30 days of Night leaves a lot to be desired. It's mostly run of mill and clich√©, and contradicts itself in a couple of places. (spoilers!) For instance initially the vampires seem to have super-human speed and reaction, but later in the movie they move at normal motions - likewise with strength. There's quite a lack of explanations, and too bad intriguing exposition with the vampires dialog is kept under wraps. The finale scene although a bit over-the-top does pretty well to somewhat salvage clich√©d suspense horror situations and a bad abuse and overuse of gore which hurts the film. Likewise the romance is rehashed and recycled. And there's a completely tasteless scene with a child-vampire. The makeup is done very well though. This is no John Carpentar's The Thing, but it has a few good scenes going for it and technical competency.",5,1,2,6 October 2008
There Will Be Blood," Slow Paced Bizarre tale of Greed...loses narrative pull
","There Will Be Blood immediately rips off musical theming from The Shining. No shame in doing so I guess. As a period piece it is quite competent...dialog, settings, costumes all very well done and seemed believable for an early 20th century western frontier. Dialog is somewhat sparse, but camera-work fills in for it. However, the movie's narrative base is more or less a tale of greed/competition and how it drives and perverts the main character Daniel Plainview (Oscar won for by Daniel Day Lewis here) in his relationships with those around him - particularly between his adopted son and a young split-personality preacher. As a self-proclaimed oil-man Daniel is a slightly paranoid incredulous pessimist who is predatory on all those who stand in the way of his greed. There is also an apparent mockery of religion which is built mostly on a vendetta developed throughout the story between the preacher and Oil-man who prays on the trust of the religious. The movie is slow-paced but not necessarily dull. The main character however never grows or seems to learn - so there's a sad repetition in his behavior of insecurity and lashing out. This begins to wear thin - there's no other dynamic. Unfortunately, the last 20 min of the movie are kind of absurd as the director and screenplay writer decided to go off on a tangent and leave the settings and support characters abruptly that had worked earlier on to build up...and then jolt us with a mean-spirited charade of gratuitous violence - becoming a pretentious gimmick. As it is the movie loses its pull and unfortunately cant recover off the epilogue scenes. Perhaps worth a viewing for good acting and production points.",6,4,9,8 March 2008
Man on Fire," Predictable, poor music/soundtrack, glorification of violence
","One of the worst pretentious, unintelligent ways to ruin scenes in a movie is to misplace or indulge in music, soundtracks, or sound effects that have no business being there. A woeful trend in movies nowadays is trying to substitute indistinct female singing to somehow enhance poignancy or emotion - IT Doesn't WORK and its a terrible cop-out to adding proper music or even silence. It's mindless and destroys the picture, much like when well placed sounds/music make a movie so fantastic and memorable in its positive counterpart. Man on Fire suffers badly from this. The cinematography is at times interesting, but gets distracting. Denzel Washington does a good job, but he's done much better, and the child actress Dakota Fanning was much too adult-like - whether that was a character problem in the writing, or the the actress herself, or maybe even the direction or a combination, it doesn't matter. Finally, the movie is badly predictable. It's introduction is too long, and Ceasy's killing spree is glorified and preaches violence as a cure-all. One of the main attractions is the setting of Mexico City - some excellent visuals and atmosphere....however, poor soundtrack and mindless revenge served in a predicable manner pull down this movie to less than average.",5,2,5,31 July 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Getting to the Bottom of R.P McMurphy - Great Movie
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a multi-faceted movie that works on a couple different levels. On the one hand it's a character drama involving the lead Randolph McMurphy played well by Jack Nicholson. He is a brash and alert prone to anger individual Probably on the greater hand it's a commentary on the state of psychiatry in general including many of it's pitfalls and flounderings. The whole problem with psychiatry as the movie alludes to is that there's just too much conjecture and unknown. Is someone 'faking' it, or is there something deeper? What is mental illness - and to what extent does it work? These are some of the questions the movie brings. Moreover, the movie includes some great scene including the fishing trip, basketball game, and the romping party. I particularly liked Christopher Lloyd's support as the yeller and provoker. McMurphy meanwhile brings empathy and caring for his ward-mates and clearly is struck with cabin-fever, and who wouldn't be. To be forced in place is the idea of prison, the restriction of freedom and liberty - anyway - early on the audience is warned of his prior behavior, so there's little surprise. The performances of the movie are top-notch as is the cast-mix. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is well deserving of it's acclaim. Recommended.",8,0,1,5 April 2009
Edge of Tomorrow," Highly Entertaining
","I must admit when I first saw the trailer for 'Edge of Tomorrow' I was skeptical, but a co-worker informed me he enjoyed it, and I 2nd that opinion and then some. I think this is one of the top of movies of 2014. Director Doug Liman and the writers involved have struck a great balance of action, sci-fi and humor. Of course it's not completely original but it pulls and mixes the right amounts from past ideas to blend a great hybrid story and characters with witty and succinct dialog. I thought Tom Cruise was fairly good in Oblivion recently, but here he he's topped that performance and even manages some subtlety and nuance between earlier and later character development in the story. Blunt is well directed and fulfills her co-star role with quiet resolve and physicality. Excellent direction, I'll repeat. There are some great support roles too with Bill Paxon and Brendon Gleeson(spoilers) The alien concepts and execution may not be pinnacle or wholly original, but the inception and the way the story uses time causality concepts bolsters that weakness. A great entry for Sci-Fi and 2014 - highly recommended 8/10",8,1,3,6 July 2014
Whiplash," Obsessive and Vigorous
","(spoilers) 'Whiplash', directed by Damien Chazelle, is another movie about a character with an obsession. It begs for comparisons to 'Black Swan' from a few years ago. Where Black Swan was a hallucinatory, depressive, and obsessed trip into misfortune, Whiplash plays it mostly straight with the main character more in control, and a decidedly positive and redemptive ending. Whiplash then doesn't carry the punch as strongly perhaps, though it does have the same drive. It is a great watch, with Miles Teller character unable to stop his drive and obsession until flirting with near death and a car accident brought upon by misfortune and bad luck. You can identify his drive and feel the ferocity of it fanned by J K Simmons character, a legendary drummer and 'drill sergeant' crossing the line into abusiveness. The obsession to succeed and exceed here becomes a drug, intoxicating and addicting, much like in Black Swan. Simmons rightly wins supporting actor award in this movie; he is a reminiscent of Louis Gosset Jr's Emil Foley in 'An Officer and a Gentleman' in performance level. He is feared as he is respected, and he is a bully with a purpose such that the means justifies the ends. I enjoyed this strong movie. 7.5/10",7,2,5,15 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Obnoxious, Overlong, Obscene, Unrealistic, and Over-the-Top
","You could go on-and-on with the degenerate adjectives describing this mess. If you've ever seen Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street', do yourself a favor and rewatch it before watching this ridiculous farce of a movie directed shamelessly by Martin Scorsese. Indeed 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is nearly 180 min long, but for what reason, gawd only knows as Scorsese shows the same several scenes over and over again in variation: a) an orgy or some sort of sexual encounter tastelessly b) some sort of drug intake c) weird or outlandish stock-brokers engaged in either/or/both a) and b). The worst movie I've watched this year was 'Olympus Has Fallen', but this movie wasn't too far behind. To have it put in the Oscars running shows just how incompetent the Academy is.",3,1,3,1 June 2014
The Last King of Scotland," James McAvoy with excellent co-lead
","Although Forrest Whitaker won the Oscar for best actor in this, I very much enjoyed James McAvoy as the Scottish Dr. Garrigan, the co-lead. He brings a spirited and care-free mischievousness that gets him into some trouble. Based to some degree on real people and events, this movie follows the good Doctor's exhilarating, naive, and harrowing experience in Uganda. There is good supporting characters like Kay, Sarah, Nigel, Dr. Junju that lift the movie quite a bit. And although the action and story become a little bit repetitive, the actors and direction keep the movie strongly engaging up until the final shots. (spoiler) Bewarned of one particular gruesome scene definitely not for children or maybe even adults. Whitaker indeed never strays from believability. Pretty good.",7,0,0,11 July 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Novel Idea but Will Ferrell out of Place
","I liked Stranger than Fiction for it's novel approach and quirky plot. It carries itself almost like watching some bizarre dream that you yourself are making up as you go along or are following. Likewise the music helped as off-beat and odd. It has strong acting and interesting camera work. However Will Ferrell, though decent enough in this film, doesn't seem like a good choice to lead the movie. His yelling and ranting are funny enough on Saturday Night Live or his other comedies but get a little excessive when ranging into dramatic comedies - so there's kind of a disconnect when he gets into his yelling 5-yr old persona. It disturbs the pensiveness of the rest of the movie. Other than that, the movie is pretty engaging with narration and high energy supporting characters. Worth a look for it's central novel approach.",7,0,0,2 August 2008
The Reader," One of 2008's best
","(spoilers)'The Reader' is a compelling watch and romance. Not going in with any foreknowledge of the story, the movie proceeds to offer up a passionate beginning and then floors you mid-way through with the facts of the past and the path of the story. By far most interesting was the character of Hanna Schmitz, played very well by Kate Winslet and almost equally as good was young David Cross playing Michael Berg. The love story is genuine if a little twisted at first. Some of the interesting angles of the storyline put morality, duty, and love at odds with one another. The WWII era evils of the Nazi state society come front and center as the Schmitz character doesn't seem to understand or comprehend her wrong-doing - seeming ignorant and remorseless. Brutal and real toward the fate of the characters, they seem to be destine for problems. Paralysis of action of the main character seems terribly believable. Writing and dialog is excellent, cast is outstanding and direction is smart. Quite enjoyable and sad.",8,0,0,16 May 2009
The Wrestler," Gritty, Real, tale of aging
","A solid movie, 'The Wrestler' has a sort of docudrama feel with the hand-held type camera work and the situations and settings. Mickey Rourke as Randy the Ram lives a truly pathetic life as a washed up wrestler. He feels alone and has almost no family. I enjoyed his romance with Pam (Marisa Tomei) the table-dancer. Both seem to want a little more normalcy out of life, but it's hard to break through stereotypes and expectations. One of the better scenes in the movie featured them at a bar reminiscing. The movie exemplifies the staleness and obsolescence relating to age and aging. The feeling and despair when youth passes us by - when you're better days were in the past. Although the father/daughter relationship feels too glossed over, the movie works well. I didn't particularly like the sporadic jerky camera movement, but it's a minor issue. Worth a watch.",7,1,1,17 May 2009
Hancock," Mixed hit and miss....
","Hancock is one of those movies that is just all over the place. At times it's trying to be a slapstick comedy or satirical, while others it gets dramatic. It has a pretty bad identity crisis. Once you let go of notions that the movie-makers and production really don't have a clue either, you realize that Handcock including all cast involved do an OK job keeping it interesting - however, the movie seems to be striving for satisfactory here, not excellence. The super-hero story is underdeveloped and therefore somewhat ho-hum. It has several entertaining scenes and dialog. Will Smith doesn't really salvage the movie, but helps to make it somewhat bearable and entertaining here and there. Wasn't surprising he produced it. Still scores a little higher than I am Legend - Mixed.",5,1,3,19 August 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Inane Money Grab
","Close to a turkey, PG13 rated 'Kong Skull Island' is a schizoid couple bad movies in one. This movie is 2017's Jurassic World'. Brainless violence littered all over its runtime, with only a semi-interesting finale monster battle-royale to lift its rating. It doesn't save stupid, stupid written in characters who serve as fodder for a variety of oversized critter incidences. Throw in one of Chinese Production Company special select Chinese actress with absolutely no business being in the movie, who can hardly speak English, and you have an awful over-produced under-thought joke of a movie. Not only is the movie a shameless money- grab from audiences, but it was certainly a money-haul for several younger and older Hollywood actors and actresses. You want a moderately better Big Creature Movie, watch 'Pacific Rim'. 4/10 not recommended.",4,0,1,11 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the Newer Ones - puts this 4th
","This final episode stands pretty well on its own. Palpatine is definitely stand-out as the villain which creates for a evil disturbing atmosphere. McDirmand (sp?) brings back his old familiar character as really the true survivor from the original series. Problems from the prior 2 are still evident here - although they've been masked over with significantly better editing - those being stilted hollow dialogue here and there, and poor direction; in most cases one seems to cause the other. The scenes with Anakin and the Queen are often this way. The fast paced story helps to let forget these stilted scenes. Also in some cases the full creation of outworldly creatures and settings remind of 'Hercules' cheese effects in television, but only here and there. You'll have to be willing to forgive the smaller inconsistencies. Otherwise this is a decent movie, one that I wouldn't buy probably just like the first 2 new ones - but one that at least gets closer to the adventure of the originals, but again hollow of the spirit and character of those for the most part.",6,0,0,10 November 2005
Inception," 2nd Quarter of Inception Stalls a bit but Eventually Gets Going
","The 2010 creation of Chris Nolan, 'Inception', is a visually striking complex story that may require a 2nd viewing to pin down some details. After an excellent beginning that pulls you in well and several changes of locale, the movie falls into about 35 min of what felt like collective lectures which really tested my wife's and my patience. In effect during the 2nd quarter of the movie Nolan has dialog trying to stand-in for exposition. We find a multitude of scenes with characters talking and planning with one another more-or-less describing and creating the rules of the movie within itself. This 'clarification' or explanation isn't needed and is cumbersome and a poor, convoluted approach. (spoiler) Yet once the 'main' drive or plan of the story initiates, the movie becomes quite engaging aided by a musical score of grandeur. We forgive the cumbersome dialog that preceded it. Nolan, director of earlier 'Memento', obviously delights in non-linear stories, and this movie takes that to higher degree with in effect 2 main plot-lines, a larger pool of players, and questions of reality and memory. It achieves a grandiose feeling, and serious pitch of emotion. Recommended.",7,1,7,28 August 2010
Defiance," Some Good Action Sequences mixed w/ bad Writing
","Defiance is a mixed bag. It features some fairly exhilarating action sequences but too much 1-liner sitcom-ish banter with fairly standard characters in a well over 2 hour movie. One-liners have little place in a holocaust movie and yet here they are littered all over the place waxing as provocative. And there seems to be some fairly standard clich√©s. Humor is not witty - and supposed accents come and go. Probably the worst sequence is a particularly tasteless cut of angry Jewish refugees angry mobbing a German soldier - over-the-top and excessive. Some of the character interaction is decent as between the brothers, and the finale action scene if unrealistic is fun to watch. All-and-all the movie needed better editing and pacing.",6,2,5,14 February 2009
WALL¬∑E," Outstanding lack of dialog and Visually Spectacular
","I don't think one Pixar movie has ever fallen into even mediocre rating. Every time I see a new production I'm blown away. Wall-E is no different. This movie really makes a great choice in cutting away dialog and letting soothing music and visuals delight us. It reaches for the stars and never stops aspiring. This is the first time Pixar has mixed in live action video too - not sure I liked it but it's novel nonetheless. I most especially liked the first 30 min of the movie set on Earth where we meet Wall-E and live sort of his daily life of wonder. Surely some of the reviewers here will remember Short Circuit - whose Johnny 5 had the same sorts of humor. In that movie the warnings and theme's dealt with the military, here of course it's the environment. This sort of message was shrewdly placed and a little bit overdone but diluted with some humor as well. Wall-E brings a fresh experience without a lot of the camaraderie of past productions, and may be the most majestic Pixar Production to date. It captures wonderful detail, music, feelings, and humor with a minimalist simplicity.",8,0,3,7 August 2008
Arrival," Laborious Mess
","(spoilers) 'Arrival', directed by Denis Villenueve is a one-trick pony Sci-fi movie that wears thin about midway through its long feeling runtime. Perhaps the story from Ted Chiang was better done, but here in the movie we are put through some linguistics philosophy and a quasi time loop dream sequence. It feels like smoke and mirrors because it is. The explanations are dream-like imagery, and the meaning or motivation is lost. There's of course clich√©d string orchestra as usual blaring (at least better than singing). The revelation that Adams character saves humanity by phoning a Chinese general is anti- climatic, hand-waving and ludicrous. The supposed tension is set by big-bad China. Yes, it used to be the Soviet Union as the big bad villain country for filmmakers, and in 'Arrival' its China. This is a shameless 'I need a sufficient villain' to manufacture tension. Also poorly thrown is film-makers need to show news feeds as sort of validation of reality, as if media is the social hand that feeds. 'Arrival' has an interesting setup and reveal of Alien Life forms, but the writing/script seems to be too smart for its own good. The last 1/3 of the movie is a complete mess. Sorry the child died, move on - blah. I've read it being compared to 'Contact' and 'Midnight Special', both of which are hands down better movies. Cannot recommend 4/10.",4,63,137,10 December 2016
Rango," Drags Sometimes but Overall OK
","'Rango', a new Dreamworks animation has some good moments for sure, but the movie drags in several places and is overall more boring than exciting on the whole. The dialog sometimes doesn't really engage or is silly. The animation itself is competent mostly, but spoiler the whole desert and western theme just wasn't very captivating. Johnny Depp is a likable actor, and he proves himself a capable voice actor here as well, but Rango is sort of devoid of personality. We see he enjoys play-acting in the beginning and is left to the same sorts of antics in the wild west town, but the movie seems kind of superficial in the dialog. The jokes are hit- and-miss. I liked the bats/wagon-chase scene as entertaining, but the western theme is sort of stale as a whole. I guess Rango can be mildly recommended as OK.",6,0,1,24 September 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdbrain
","'Birdman' directed by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu was a disappointment. Catching it on a flight, I fell asleep for about 15 min or so of its runtime. Inarritu puts showbusiness front and center including Michael Keaton's character's mental illness induced supposedly by his own vanity. There isn't much to relate to for me in this movie. I don't care about fame or theatre art much per se, and the storytellers have Keaton lashing out at himself mainly in response. Their answer? His character committing suicide, so instead of learning to be comfortable with himself, the storytellers glorify his tragedy. This was not a great movie to say anything of an Oscar. You may find you enjoy the acting, bravado, or even his tragedy, but although performances were OK, I didn't find it entertaining much 6/10 - and a disappointment, unworthy of a nomination to say anything of Best Picture. Seemed pretentious at least.",6,0,4,15 March 2015
The Conjuring," Fun Quasi-Exorcist Update
","Directed by Horror Genre leader, James Wan, 'The Conjuring' is one of his best efforts. Although not as original as Insidious I enjoyed this horror almost as much. It has more disturbing imagery than his earlier hit, and a more traditional story. Indeed the latter parts of this movie are akin to the decades old 'Exorcist' but somewhat less religious overall. While the Exorcist involved priests heavily, 'The Conjuring' stresses the ghost-hunters are less religious. There are a lot of good performances and creeping going on. The back story is convincing and eerie enough. There is less gore and more emphasis on creeps. The core cast do very well.",7,0,0,26 April 2015
Prometheus," Doing Your Homework
","(spoilers)Recently I watched Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' on a long haul flight, and was disappointed, especially when comparing it to the original masterpiece of the series, 'Alien'. I'm willing to let go some of the borrowing of original content, but here is an example of a movie where director, writers, and editors fail to tighten up dirt-poor script-writing and don't do a good job with the cast. I get tired of the over-trodden clich√©s where foolish characters behave ridiculously to suit the story - examples, the 2 engineers 'playing' with an alien like it's a pet snake, or crew-members opening the outside doors of the ship with abandon. The whole crew besides the android was blase...you have supposed PHD's acting like nothing of the sort taking off their helmets in a foreign atmospheres, and mostly behaving and sounding like children. Charlize Theron's character was was way too obviously written in as the token antagonist - no subtleties or shading whatsoever - smack me in the face with plot-devices why don't you. The captain of the ship didn't stand for anything and was spineless. This was supposed to be an expert mission? On the other side of things, the many effects were generally outstanding although some of their alien concepts were blatantly ripped off from STTNG episode content (specifically 'Time's Arrow' Multi-part episodes). So Scott and the troop of 4+ writers should know better (the more writers involved usually spells trouble). Correcting a lot of this laziness and doing your homework with the script may have turned things around - oh and to boot, the music and sound effects were mostly unremarkable and paled in comparison to the original as well. Disappointing.",4,1,2,29 September 2012
The Woman in Black," Spooky Atmosphere but Lacking Story
","Directed by James Watkins and adapted and based from a novel, ' Woman in Black' shows some promise early on, but ends up being a parlor-trick type movie with a glaring lack of story. The acting is satisfactory making it more disappointing. About halfway into it's runtime, we are still barraged by cheap tricks - creaking noises, shadowy figures, and the woman(demon) itself. The story is badly underdeveloped. (spoiler) And even worse, an utterly unbelievable and wretched ending ensues - one so bad it brings about chuckles. For the director, you can't have it both ways regarding the ending. To see a superior horror movie check out 'The Others' a magnificent movie in both atmosphere and story. Too bad, as they had the look and atmosphere nailed - a good starting point. Not Recommended.",4,2,3,22 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Some Good Scenes but Overlong and Disjointed
","After an OK last X-Men film with some heavy-hitting actors seemingly riding into the sunset, Marvel and a new set of cast and director comes roaring back in a quite long but not altogether dull 'reboot' type movie. Especially for the first hour or so of it's runtime, 'X-Men First Class' is disjointed and everywhere - it lacks focus and drags out it's introduction too long. However, by the 2nd half, the movie has settled down and the characters have mostly come together. The strength of the cast, like the older movies, is rightfully with it's 2 leads James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, especially McAvoy who seems to faithfully represent a young and dashing Xavier. I enjoyed almost every scene with him present. Unfortunately though Kevin Bacon's antagonist seems more mischievous than truly malevolent so the movie kind of lacks an arch-villain. Anyway, there are both worse and better superhero movies out there.",6,1,2,23 October 2011
The Wolverine," Dull and Terrible: An Awful Combination
","The 2nd worst movie not far behind 'Now You See Me' in 2013, directed by James Mangold atrociously goes to 'The Wolverine'. This is a complete dud of a movie managing to be dull and full of American Stereotypes of Japanese, and probably at it's worst with cringe-worthy acting from most involved save Jackman. Most of the fault goes to the directors and script writers. This movie is a failure on several levels. It starts out promising enough with a quick montage from WWII supposedly, and then State-side, but degenerates badly when the main story starts, and the horrible dialog, direction, and acting that the Japanese actors have to put-in and up with. Like 'Pacific Rim', it's more Asia-philia but without Rim's fun and spectacle. The action is mostly poor and weakly shot and realized. Jackman obviously got pumped up again, and the filmmakers overdo his shirt-less scenes, but I kept waiting for the movie to get more intense or infuse itself with energy, but it's pulse-less. Not even worth a rental, sad to say unless your a die-hard Jackman fan. 4/10",4,7,14,31 August 2013
Win Win," Very Good Dramedy
","There's a coziness and relatability that runs pretty high in Thomas McClathy's 'Win-Win' starring Paul Giamatti and Alex Shaffer. The movie manages a great offbeat blend of comedy and drama. The acting is very good and unforced. The environment and backdrop in wrestling is new and more original. And the story although not original is fleshed out enough with a great ending. I particularly liked all the goofy coach cheer-leading and horsing around, and thought Alex Shaffer, whom I read is a real wrestler, did a great job in his acting debut, a performance reminiscent of Sean Penn's in 'At Close Range'. This is certainly one of the better movies of 2011. Recommended.",8,0,1,18 August 2011
Iron Man," Good Middle Third, but Stale clich√©d Story/Romance
","Ironman does well overall despite a formulaic, stale, and implausible storyline. It's sleek effects are competent, and (spoiler) it's middle third where Stark develops his suit cozy and entertaining, like someone inviting you to their abode to show you their new pride of ownership. I know nothing of the comic book origins or how faithful this movie is to it, nor do I really care - fact is making interesting villains helps to separate good and great movies, and the writing isn't there for these villains. (spoiler) Jeff Bridges is a fun actor to watch, but doesn't quite have substance here, and when are writers and people going to stop with the continual poor clich√© of Middle Eastern Terrorists....stick to corrupt drug lords at least as a better clich√© instead of following the mindless propaganda. Also the romance is pretty much an afterthought. Gweyneth Paltrow is completely uninvolving and maybe miscast. But the effects and lavishness are wonderful to behold - as if capturing the spirit of a teenager who gets to work on his own sports-car. There is some good, light humor along the way. So, I'd recommend Ironman although maybe not glowingly which is a lot better than a lot of movies these days...it make it above the mixed category into solid and worthy despite some of it's lackings.",7,1,2,22 June 2008
Blade Runner," Favorite Science Fiction Movie imparts pure Melancholy
","Saw the original cut of Blade Runner in late 80's as a kid growing up then. It was and is an utterly mesmerizing cinematic experience - easily my favorite science fiction film. It's mixture of visuals, music, characters, and dialog rendering a future succeeds in evoking despair, sadness, and finality of something winding down. The movie is wonderfully re-watchable and fantastically brings you down with melancholy. Everything isn't always happy in the world, and it's just as valid and cathartic to experience this in a movie as any other emotion. As counter to many Blade Runner enthusiasts, I'm a huge fan of Harrison Ford's narration - beyond exactly what he's saying I think his octave and cadence lends credence to the mood - it's an enhancement. We feel comforted by his voice validating what his character is going through, unable to make sense of a world and people and replicants blurring together. Vangelis as with Year of Living Dangerously and Chariots of Fire, creates wondrous work key to creating the experience with blue-sy retreads and electronic flat/sharp chords. Ridley Scott has never surpassed himself in scope and detail - his perfectionism and vision have never been better. This is a beacon and marker for other movies to try to aspire to not only in terms of look and design but of effectiveness in evoking an intended atmosphere and mood, exactly what movies are designed to do.",10,0,2,6 February 2009
Casino Royale," Pretty good first half, OK 2nd - not really Bondish though
","James Bond movies have been around for ages, and as long as I can remember, I've enjoyed watching their repetitive silliness and story lines. Part of what makes it fun is the Bond character himself. With almost a half dozen Bond actors people have their favorites - usually Connery or Moore. I myself liked Moore as the most cheeky and chauvinistic. Pierce Brosnan was not far behind with his suave ways. Now comes the next Bond actor - Daniel Craig. How does he do and how is Casino Royale? - both OK. As Bond he's a bit stoic and athletic and not as mouthy or suave. He seems very earnest and serious, a lot like Timothy Dalton was in his The Living Daylights. The movie opens well and holds the fort down about until the action switches to Montenegro, from there on in it's a bit by the numbers swimming in familiar territory (spoiler) with a really tasteless torture scene. As a film I'd rank it as a bit above OK about a B-. As a Bond movie it doesn't have the campiness or playfulness as much; it's better than some, but still behind many of them. I'd rank it similar to Die Another Day, above World is not Enough, way above Golden Eye, and below Tomorrow Never Dies of the newer ones. Is it worth seeing in the theater - probably not unless you're a Bond fan. A little disappointed overall, but not too much. Daniel Craig should make for promising future Bond movies.",6,2,4,18 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Pretty Good Pixar
","I liked the new Toy Story 3 fairly well although it's not quite up to par to many of the newer Pixar releases, and not as involving as the original Toy Story or as entertaining as the Toy Story 2. I'd rank it a little behind 'Up' in terms of entertainment. It was a fun outing worth catching in the theater. Most (if not all) the original voice actors are back in action and do a satisfactory job of voice work. The underlying story is somewhat slow moving at times while there are a couple standout funny parts, and a good beginning and touching ending. I think it's about time to put this particular movie series to bed although it's original predecessor helped usher in the era for Pixar Movies for which I always have quite high expectations.",7,4,7,10 August 2010
Before Sunrise," A Doddle of a Movie at Ease
","I've seen parts of this movie over the years and cant believe its age already. Finally sat down and watched it in its entirety and enjoyed it as capturing romance effectively. Julie Delpy who has a more difficult role due to her language background leads the story and the encounter really making the movie. This one of the only romances or dramas that effectively doesn't formula. Instead of there being a quarrel and make-up, the tension is built on the issue of time. In excellent quality blazing it's own path, the movie sticks with a real and believable outcome. Best conversation scene in the movie was the telephone calls and the character's divulging their attractions to one another. Good for a more originality in storyline and the director's choices to not cave to clich√©. Recommended.",7,2,3,30 December 2010
Thor: The Dark World," Sitcomish Humor Drags at This Sequel
","Not directed by Kenneth Branagh, 'Thor: The Dark World', seems to suffer for it. The problem which really made the movie turgid was awful over- usage of of sitcom 1-liner humor trying to play off as wit. Rather there at least a dozen 'joke' lines that are feeble, unimaginative, and make you wonder if you're watching a super-hero movie or a Thursday night made-for- TV outing. I don't understand how this kind of script gets green-lit, devoid of intelligence or editing. The other issue for me is the dull yacking of characters for about the first 30 min of the movie - GET ON WITH IT filmmakers - stop trying to describe a movie through dialog - show it happening! Looking past these, the movie starts to take off finally for the 2nd 2/3 of runtime. It does not have the focus, soundtrack, wit, and direction of it's predecessor. Give it about a 6.5/10 closer to a 6 maybe. Could've been much better.",6,2,4,7 December 2013
Am√©lie," Fantastically whimsical romance
","Another great foreign movie, Amelie is superb in its whimsical romantic element. Vibrant with color, zany editing, and fabulous narration along with great music, this movie is magnificent from start to end. It dares to be bizarre in a controlled way to lift the material from the clich√©d romantic comedy to a dashing witty journey of one young women's plight and observations of love in her own mind. Strange weird imagery and day-dreaming freshen up scenes. Side stories were well placed and supportive in tone bringing some screen time to deserved supporting cast members. On going pranks were amusing but not overly used as. This movie really sets a new standard for whimsy. It captures a strange, wonderful mood and look never straying into seriousness. Not for those who like serious things....worthy of your collection or at least a viewing.",9,1,5,24 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Checks All the Boxes
","(spoilers) Director JJ Abrams steps into the Star Wars universe nicely unsurprisingly after how he transformed the new Star Trek movies into more Star-Wars-esque. He seems like a good fit. However the movie keeps so much in the original 77 movie that it is more like a quasi- remake than sequel. Abrams is so intent on checking all the boxes it seems he forgets to let the movie become his own creation. In his defense this is a monumental undertaking. There's no wonder he was reportedly hesitant and anxious to helm such a beloved series. The end result is nicely nostalgic, but at the same time kind of stale. There is too much 'coloring in the lines' for this movie to be rated glowingly. Harrison Ford certainly lends mightily to the franchise, but this feels like a nice merry-go-round ride, something you loved as a kid, but is too tame and too familiar now. Give it a generous 6/10 and worth one viewing.",6,7,16,21 December 2015
Flight," A Bit Disappointing/ Mixed
","I had seen the trailer for 'Flight', directed by Robert Zemeckis, once and saw a good average review, and the movie featured Denzel Washington, so figured it looked like at least a satisfactory time to be had. (major spoiler) And for me the movie is exciting especially for it's first 45 min or so thanks in no small part to amazing flying and crashing sequences. Technically this was the best I've ever seen in a movie, at least a full factor better than the next best plane crash sequence I can remember in 'Fearless'. However, the movie is not really about the Flight, but rather about the main character Whip Whitaker( Denzel Washington) and his simple but continual alcohol and drug dependence. By the end of the movie I felt like I'd been watching an AA collaboration hijack an earlier great movie I was watching. Substance abuse and it's melodrama is not really what I enjoy watching in movies, especially as the focal theme. So I Felt disappointed, misled, and tired of that continual theme almost non-stop for last 90 min of the movie. I didn't want to watch 'Clean and Sober' with a plane crash thrown in. Will give it 6/10 for it's fist 45 min though.",6,0,2,15 December 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Too Much Filler, Bloated
","I thought the original Hunger Games was stronger than this bloated-filler of a 2nd movie. Not that the original was a great movie, but it's story was better intact. No longer are trilogies good enough as stand-alone movies, and Director Francis Lawerence's 'Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is a case in point. Like The Hobbit movies, these movies seem more and more like TV episodes. In Catching Fire, there is an awful 1st half, followed by a weak retread of the same mindless reality TV survivor themes. Finish that off with a gaping ending.(spoilers) What are audiences treated to? Try a pack of baboons, electrocution, and acid-fog. Is this the best story-tellers can come up with? This movie is a shameless money-grab, plain and simple. It offers little freshness compared to the original which was itself a 6/10. Not Recommended - 4/10.",4,12,23,9 January 2014
Godzilla," Quite Bad
","Do yourself a favor and watch Pacific Rim again or for the first time, whose creators at least know how to focus a story correctly. I haven't watched the 90's Godzilla, but this can't be much better. Godzilla needs to be about Godzilla, and this pod of pond scum movie certainly is not. Filmmakers cop-out in trying to make some sort of human element diluting the watered out movie anyhow. As clich√©d and done in dozens of other movies, the characters and scientists are idiots. The battles are sparse, and the finale ones are difficult to see thanks to poor lighting. Godzilla was hardly in the movie too. This is a steamer. A failure and dud devoid of concept or intelligence - a big budget bloated floaty.",4,2,5,1 November 2014
Looper," Atrociously Bad
","A complete disappointment and utterly atrocious, Rian Johnson's 'Looper' is a disjointed, gratuitously violent, wanna-be science fiction. It has nothing but a couple gimmicks masquerading as science-fiction or has ripped off from prior movies like Matrix. Film-makers, if you're reading, gun-fire does not equate to good-action. The excuse of a story meanders and is muddled in a bad way. We get to watch a dozen close-up shot-gun blastings of people as if one is not enough. The future is poorly imagined - probably due to a slim budget, or perhaps Bruce Willis has somehow deflated the movie's budget for everything else. He's in about 40 min of the runtime - less than half. Way too much time is spent in corn fields and expository dialog. You have the director casting Jeff Daniels, that's right Jeff Daniels, as the mob-boss. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's makeup in an attempt to look like Bruce Willis is distractingly poor. There is actually scenes of shooting (at) children. What a complete steaming turd this movie is. The Time Machine is a concept rip-off of Twelve Monkeys done half-a$$ed. This is low-concept, and I was duped once again by a high average IMDb review. Deserves a 3/10. Not even worth a library check-out. Stay away, or go watch 12 Monkeys or Blade Runner if you want better science-fiction.",3,3,8,1 January 2013
Heat," Michael Mann's Best; One of 90's best
","My gusher of a review - Epic in length and equally good, Heat is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. It has everything a movie-following man (and woman if you like violent cops and robbers)could want in a superbly finished and edited package. Yes, everything is outstanding in this movie - the drama, the story, and most especially the cinematography and acting. Leading the way is Al Pacino's performance whose bravado is 2nd to none - he is full of intense energy and wit. Robert De Niro is not far behind, chameleon-like, patient, and thoughtfully calculating. All supporting cast from small roles to lead support are interesting and dynamic. The script is concise and simple; likewise the dialog - very well written and believable. The action is graphic though not gratuitous. It's well placed and enhancing. Best support comes from Kevin Gage as Waingrove and Jon Voight as Nate - both understated and sharply well acted and additionally Mykelti Williamson who injects some stern realism to Pacino's emotional explosiveness. Running over 2 and half hours, you'd hardly notice as engrossing as this gem is. There are scant few scenes that the movie would benefit from being cut, and the music gives a great shading and undertone to the LA lights and settings. A defining movie for the 90s, and a superior effort for the crime drama genre in cinema, Heat stands out glowingly. Highly recommended.",10,4,8,10 April 2009
Cloud Atlas," Fortune Cookie Dialog Weighs Heavily
","The Wachowski brothers are back with top actors Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in 'Cloud Atlas' that has some of the feel, pomp, and grandeur of Chris Nolan's 'Inception' or the brothers earlier 'Matrix' movies. One of the problems though is the apparent weakness in the supposed overall connection with all the different stories.(Spoilers)I was hoping for a better tie-in than some shooting-star birth marks shared with many of the characters across space and time. Also several of the stories were shallow or not well developed particularly the 2012 and the 1936 time- frames. What really lost it for me though was the Fortune Cookie aphorisms and simplifications like 'conventions in lives are boundaries' or 'love is everything' that should NOT be narrated - do the writers think we need to be spoon-fed? There's some Kooky kumbaya detectable, and avid film-goers deserve better. Too bad too, as Cloud Atlas has a pretty nifty production design, and the futuristic sci/fi stories are fairly good despite the dialog. Perhaps sticking with just that final Sci-fi pairing and developing a deeper story between them would've been stronger. This one deserves a mixed/so-so rating.",5,7,15,13 April 2013
300," Kooky Junk with a few good fight scenes
","A stark example of all style with no substance, '300' is essentially a gore-fest with gratuitous, gratuitous loads of poorly rendered blood splats and severed limbs. This limp biscuit of a story gets narrated through with hollow clunkiness and equally tattered story. Probably the worst liberty the filmmakers take is the 'hoorah' call obviously aimed at military battle-goon-ship. Almost is bad is the background mismash of rock guitar swinging to opera singers in a schizo background music lineup. The only interesting scenes were the brief battle with the caged animalistic giant and a few of the battle choreographies. Everything else is squawky lines meant to sound magnanimous. The look is clearly the goal in this movie, and while it achieves golden color and some artsy backdrops, it cant pull any weight alone, since it has no anchor of story or solid characters to carry it. This movie is shameful at it puts gore, blood, and violence as virtuous. Pop kooky junk.....and poor.",4,0,1,15 May 2009
Easy A," Mockingly Hackneyed
","'Easy A' starts off OK for about 10-15 min of the runtime but degenerates into trashy reprehensible mockery. Watching a bunch of 20-somethings parade around a fictitious high school as utterly unconvincing high school students with ADD, false-religion, and zeal fails at being a farce. The rip-offs from older and better done 'teen' and John Hughes movies litters this movie and signals it's bereavement of ideas. Particularly awful are decent full-aged and experienced adult actors as parents reduced to mocking child-buddies especially Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. For example in several scenes, you have Clarkson giving inappropriate WAY over-the-top sex talks with her high school daughter, lead Emma Stone. This movie is a sad example of supposed aimed parody that utterly fails. Stay away or if you have to pick it up at the library.",3,14,23,22 December 2010
Fast Five," Braindead on Arrival; Could Not Finish
","I usually finish movies - even bad ones - but this is worse than bad. Girl: 'I'm Pregnant'....Boy: 'You're Kidding me!?'.... or 'This Mission just went from Mission Impossible, to Mission Insanity'....yes that's the kind of completely brain-dead dialog that's commonplace in this holy-hell-crud-fest. This is a movie whose story and dialog has the sophistication of a Grand-Theft-Audio Video Game. It features ludicrous action sequences, terrible direction, and equally bad acting and line deliveries. There are lots of good looking people on screen with stilted cue-card-bad line-delivery take your pick of any actor involved. Before even starting this stink-fest you knew who the target audience was for by the PG-13 rating. To top off, the music is lifted from old Miami Vice episodes. Not worth your time. A true turkey!",2,1,3,12 November 2011
Click," 1-Trick-Pony goes downhill
","Click may not be a horrible movie, but degenerates and is pretty bad by the ending. It's schizophrenic in that it doesn't know whether it's a comedy or a drama, and pretty much flops on both. Some of the gags are funny, but the seriousness feels misplaced after so many antics early on. Towards the end fast-forward button started getting used a whole lot as the movie has gone into downright preachy territory replete with Sandler miserably trying to act as an old man. Of course the whole idea has done before minus the remote as the one novelty which after the first 45 min doesn't have any new ideas besides a really poorly contrived auto-fast forward ridiculously explained as the remote keying in on the Sandler character's tastes. Acting is pretty bleh too. Check this out at the library for free; barely worth a rental.",4,1,2,14 May 2009
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Great Production and Show
","One of the better movies of the 90's, I remember really enjoying 'Interview with the Vampire' in the theater,1994. It was extremely hyped at the time with a young Brad Pitt and Cruise in one of his better roles. Thankfully the movie holds on to a lot of what makes it entertaining and great over 17 years later now. Neil Jordan directed a stage-like performance and atmosphere complete with outstanding music, sets, and costuming backing up a devilishly good script apparent thanks to screenplay/author Anne Rice. It stands out imo as one of the best modern vampire movies made in the last 30 years. The leading actors are all enjoyable, and there's a satirical and witty look at the life and history of vampires - especially that of Louie - Brad Pitt's character, the narrator. While the ending might be a little bit hokey, the voyage of the movie easily makes up for it. Of note, Kirstin Dunst has several great scenes in her breakout role. Strongly Recommended",8,0,0,25 November 2011
Sin City," Dynamic Visuals, so-so acting/directing/narration
","There's no denying the look of this film. It's been done before though in a similar vein with Dick Tracey and Sky-Captain - probably a superior look imo. Sky Captain was more of traditional movie and thus much more appealing. The stories are of course are graphic novelish - and not being a fan of that - the movie is pretty much just gratuitous comic-bookish violence with often average to poor acting - so to evaluate the movie is difficult because I didn't what it was made for. Narration is often flat too. However the visuals especially when motion is involved are competently put together and at times spectacular. Supporting gratuitous violence really doesn't give the movie anything to stand for, and so it's more of a so-so experience, maybe worth watching once unless you like gratuitous violence depicted.",5,2,3,30 August 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Great 1st two-thirds/ Standard last third
","This Oscar winner may not be deserved as a Best Picture of the Year especially compared to the Reader, but it marks a big improvement over the past several Best Pictures especially including Crash and No Country for Old Men - 2 awful movies which prove the utter distaste and clownship that the academy has eroded into recently. At least Slumdog Millionaire is a good movie. It's first half is quite enthralling in setting, pacing, story, and detail. The child-actors completely shine for this movie. Especially captivating were the brothers together dynamically and their adventures (spoiler) into the darker reaches of society with child peddlers and literal garbage heaps. However the story and really the actors by young adulthood seem sort of standard and hackneyed. They're not terrible, in fact satisfactory, but they didn't hold my interest level the way the children and story did earlier. Part of it may have been the sheer grotesqueness of the slums portrayed early on. Slumdog Millionaire's storyline is overall well developed and paced, with a simple and effective narrative. It was one of the better movies of 2008 - for me maybe not an Academy Award winner (I thought The Reader should've taken honors), but a movie with quite a few high points and definitely recommended.",7,2,7,17 August 2009
Hacksaw Ridge," Remarkable Story a Bit Overcooked
","(Major Spoilers) Director Mel Gibson has a flare for the dramatic in 'Hacksaw Ridge', and the blasting score and unrelenting violence is lathered on a little heavy for this reviewer's taste. Not knowing the story, I find it difficult to fathom that all fellow troops sat idol while Private Doss lowered down man after man after man. No one bothered to help him apparently. Performances range from very good from Weaving, to good from Garfield and Worthington, to out-of-place for Vince Vaughn. Stealing the show for certain though about a third through is introduced Aussie Luke Bracey - a breakout movie for him as Smitty, owning most every scene he's in. Although he's in a supporting role, he's magnetic, and Gibson figured it out. The movie, a tale of 2 halves is beautifully shot, but the music gets a little much as does the violence - a misplaced glory with it sort of feels off-kilter and strangely hypocritical between content and portrayal. Still recommended though for the captivating story. 7.5/10",7,1,6,3 December 2016
Me Before You," MTV Song Transitions Sink this One
","A fairly good story by Jojo Moyes gets deep-sixed by awful, awful, music cuts and transitions infesting scene shift after scene in what could've been a good albeit maudlin script of 'Me Before You'. Fault lies mostly with editors and director Thea Sharrock for completely over-indulging singing music cuts. Sorry Sharrock, in editing with film when it comes to music and audio, less is more. Kumbaya might be OK for campfires, but not for stories of paraplegics or cinema. MTV is its own category. There's a time and a place for it, but not in supposedly serious subject matter. Clarke and Claflin are not at fault and do a good job in this movie. Too bad directors and editors cannot fathom or recognize their own tacky and poor soundtrack editing. 5/10 cannot recommend.",5,2,5,30 September 2016
The Breakfast Club," 2nd to Risky Business
","Breakfast Club is definitive of great 80's dramedies. I rank it 2nd to Risky Business which is more grown-up, soul-felt, and has the best music and soundtrack with Tangerine Dream. The Breakfast Club deals pretty well with teen issues even if sort of cookie-cutterish. It too has great music in its own right to push it into the high excellence class. It stands out as a page in time moving farther and farther away. Sure its not really close to some of the great films in cinema, and with that comment growing up with this movie puts these opinions as biased. Still all the cast are memorable if a little shy in general. John Hughes has in this one of his best movies. It's quick and heartfelt with believable character growth. And it's great to revisit every-so-often. Judd Nelson stands out in his performance even if he doesn't much resemble a high-schooler. Paul Gleason also is quite convincing as a burnt-out educator disciplinarian. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,4 August 2005
Donnie Darko," Moody, Atmospheric, and Entertaining
","Directed by Richard Kelly, 2001's 'Donnie Darko' is at the time young Jake Gyllenhaal's breakthrough movie as a lead actor. It achieves an otherworldly feel with aspects of the movie that lend it strength including excellent atmospheric music, quirky cynical dialog, quantum physics musings, and Gyllenhaal and Mary McDonnal's acting performances. Re-watched the movie recently after initially seeing it a year after its release date and felt that I understood it much better probably because I paid closer attention. It deals with issues of time-paradox mixed with a bit of religion, and some certain disdain for Middle and High School. The movie is a solid effort that's lifted with writing, acting, and music, although it does overuse music video edits. About a 7.5/10",8,0,3,27 December 2013
The Social Network," Stylish but Vapid, Pretentious, Much Ado....
","I found the plot of 'The Social Network' to be ultimately a poor story with little substance amid lots of materialism and lust for fame. The movie apparently 'loosely' depicts a real-life Mark Zuckerberg in his quest to make Facebook a social and wide ranging Network for grandiose visions of being the one-stop haven for connecting for others in society. The movie does a poor job of creating conflict by somehow showing the Zuckerberg character as unhurt or unaffected by lawsuits by former school-mates and friends. It's an excuse to show preppy sheltered kids and their materialistic dreams - hardly stirring. The cinematography and soundtrack are well done, but cant make up for a lack of honesty. By the end of the movie I was glad to turn it off yearning for a movie with characters that have back-bones.",5,0,0,24 June 2011
Back to the Future," Special Place in 80s Movies
","Rewatched Back to the Future recently for the first time in 5 or 6 years and decided to rate it for fun here. In all honesty this movie is probably not a '9', but growing up with with it, I attach huge sentimental value to it. The script is a work of art as is the energy, pacing, and acting. The cast and director really hit the right blend of humor and adventure rarely seen in movies even now. I particularly loved Christopher Lloyd as the manic absent-minded professor. His comic facial expressions and clumsiness come off great. No part of this movie is poorly done, and the accompanying music is superb. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic if you've never seen it before.",9,0,0,2 September 2009
The Great Gatsby," Solid Entry
","There's been several entries into film for this Novel material from Fitzgerald, but I haven't seen the others, and read the book long ago forgetting many of the details. This installment 'The Great Gatsby' by director Baz Luhrmann is a good run with the exception of one highly grating and irritating liberty taken by the filmmakers - mixing contemporary and classic music anachronistically. Didn't work at all, and was a big mistake - for a piece based on period literature over 50 years ago. That out of the way, the actors performances range from excellent to satisfactory with Joel Edgerton turning in the best performance as Buchanon. Absolutely loved the climactic argument with Edgerton and Dicaprio. The single funniest and most entertaining moment in the movie is Edgerton's Buchanon snidely and cynically laughing at Dicaprio's Gatsby spilling on about 5-year love to Daisy. Great visuals. 7/10 and recommended",7,0,2,10 October 2013
Hustle & Flow," Involving with strong characters
","This is purely a character driven picture. The acting is very good on all counts. There is frustration, angst, and hope that is palpable. The director wisely cuts out a lot of the gritty details of the hustle and focuses more on the characters as humans trying to survive. It helps to identify with care for the people involved. The story is simple yet focused and involves some growth and learning. Particularly enjoyable was Djay's friendship with the people around his life. The ending was a bit of cop-out though causing me to wonder if the character had actually learned anything about humility. A bit of a letdown. Otherwise it was a good drama worth the watch and rental.",7,0,0,10 January 2006
Warm Bodies," Fairly Entertaining
","Being a big fan of Walking Dead television series, my review for 'Warm Bodies' is undoubtedly positively biased. It was a good watch with several good laughs. It also has a nice to see some originality. Indeed, I'd rate the movie between a 6 and 7 - closer to 7. Young lead Nicholas Hoult does a good job with his line-delivery and zombiness. The movie is especially witty and clever in it's initial third or so. Beautiful young Teresa Palmer is up to the test to be the lead love interest. She is a bit Tom- boyish, the right amount so. On the lesser side John Malkovich has a bit role, maybe not even needed - part of the weaker side of the story involving human fighters. Worth a watch, especially for zombie fans.",7,1,1,16 November 2013
Princess Mononoke," Another Good Miyazaki Entry
","Although not among my favorite Miyazaki films, Princess Mononoke must be given high praise for what is the standard for classical animation - Miyazaki. It's story is intriguing, but perhaps the most violent of any Miyazaki film - maybe too much. Despite that, it conjures up an interesting more historically leaning movie pitting man against nature. My favorite ideas in the movie were the kodama or forest sprites living in abundance to mark the health of the natural growth of plants, flowers, and animals as well as the kami-shika (deer god). Both were fantastically creative. The characters in the movie were fairly well done and the lack of romance was appealing. Perhaps more than other Miyazaki movies the hues of green in this movie jump out of the screen in colors as striking as any Miyazaki film. What I found a bit lacking (only in comparison) was some of the wonder and fantasy in other Miyazaki films which carry them to truly magical heights. Nonetheless, Mononoke-hime is a violent cautionary tale maybe meant to be so to jolt his usual audiences.",7,1,3,30 March 2009
Cinderella Man," Decent, but overcooked at times
","In general, Cinderalla Man does pretty well. Its worth a rental, but I probably wouldn't purchase it. The narrative flowed pretty well and didn't drag that much; I took into account that the director and screenwriter were basing the material off a biography for the most part. I didn't like some of the side-story detours though like with his drunk friend who died after trampled - it felt melodramatic. The acting was for the most part good - especially Paul Giamatti, lighting up the boxing scenes and portraying a good friend and coach amiably with some verve. Crowe plays it low key and also does decently although his supposedly Irish accent sounds more Italian and slips at times, but that's minor. He's convincing enough as a Dad, Husband, and fighter. The period sets were also interesting, along with clothes, music, and life in the 30's - seeming plausible and additive to the story. Now, the child actors could've done better though - a little too directed maybe, and I'm not sure Renee Zellweger fits the role unfortunately....her persona felt misplaced. Where does the story feel overcooked? - the final 30 min or so, should have been edited and I didn't much care for the clich√©d crowds/audiences in churches, bars, ring-sides etc demonstrating how we the audience should feel, or the contextual overuse of prayer granted they're Irish. The music/score sometimes felt cued and noticeably distracting. But despite the annoyances I found Cinderella Man to be entertaining and and with sporadic strong scenes.",7,0,2,6 December 2005
Alien: Covenant," Another Brainfart Alien Movie in the Series
","(major spoilers) No better than 'Prometheus', even with director Ridley Scott helming, 'Alien Covenant''s script is Dead on Arrival with ridiculous lapses in judgment of characters and a complete void of logic on too many occasions beyond forgiveness. This is in spite of fairly competent effects, a shame really. Once again plot developments rely on clich√©d stupidities and mistakes of supposed 'trained' crew. Later we preposterously have the android acting as parent to baby aliens replete with soothing flute music. Ending 20 min is laughably predictable and retrodden. This is the same unchecked overthinking in earlier entries that gum up simple effective stories. There's a clear homage to 'Blade Runner' in one sequence, but this movie doesn't get close to Scott's earlier movies, is a mess, and yet another letdown in the series unfortunately. 4/10 Poor.",4,2,4,27 August 2017
Up in the Air," Aloof w/ Bad Folksy Montage Music & shameless advertising
","Up in the Air is not a bad movie - it just has quite a few annoying attributes that doesn't make it a good movie. The acting is fairly well done as with the direction, but the filmmakers go with a nauseating art-house folk guitar stringing begging us to feel like there's added meaning when in fact it does quite the opposite showing vapid thoughtlessness and lack of dialog. This isn't anything new; it's a newer unfortunate trademark of many recent movies. Equally annoying is blatant product placement - more gratuitous than even castaway - thanks Hilton, Hertz, and American Airlines for paying George Clooney's salary. Take away these 2 main problems and you have a good movie - at least 7/10. This movie has a few things to say about loneliness, travel, and the weary life a road warrior - and it's done fairly well. If you don't mind the listed annoyances, then you might like the movie.",6,1,2,18 January 2010
V for Vendetta," Clich√©d, uninvolved, poor directing/editing/decision making
","This movie's atmosphere and some of the camera-work reminded me of The Running Man (that old Arnie movie 80s stinker) without any of its fun - all those ridiculous scenes with audience members and extras watching television or movies - ridiculously self-absorbed as if watching other audience reacting is stirring. Directors the world over should know better than to show movie's or visuals of actors/actresses/extras watching other movies or TV!!! The last thing I want to watch is other actors and actresses watching movies/television within a movie or TV show - it's completely pretentious, flat, and decadent. It's about as much fun as looking in a mirror of yourself with another mirror behind you. This movie fails as trying to be introspective - it has a decent revenge premise, but the whole big-brother paranoid government setup reminds of bad Arnie 80's movies minus the fun of having Arnie. V is a stuffy pompous snob, supposedly elegant yet revolutionary. The problem with movies these days is that in their effort to create style they take themselves too seriously.",5,10,18,31 May 2008
The Island," Good, but more Science Fiction and less action needed
","Here is a story immediately borrowing from Logan's Run, which was an excellent sci-fi flick from the pre-Star Wars days. There we had Logan 5, and here we have Lincoln 6 echo. The first 45 min of this story involves some interesting ideas and is intriguing to say the least with contamination, proximities, a strange lottery and a built in sort of camp society similar to the Logans. However after the setup, the ideas sort of halt for a bunch of heavy duty action sequences reminiscent of Judge Dread. The lead actors are fun to follow although I would have liked to have seen more of the Buschemi character. That part of the storyline was underdeveloped and it seemed to have strength. Also I didn't care much for the last cut-away either. But, overall the movie didn't disappoint and actually overcame my expectations which I set kind of low to begin with. The movie seemed like it didn't take full advantage of potentially better sci-fi story lines. Leave the action films to 007, but this is worth a rental.",7,0,0,17 December 2005
