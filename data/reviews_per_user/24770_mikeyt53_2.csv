The Legend of Bagger Vance," Will Smith as Bagger never worked
","I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was first released and there is only one thing that has bothered me since that first viewing: Will Smith as Bagger is too young. I know he was a hot actor when the movie was made but the part cries for Danny Glover or Morgan Freeman. A little age on the character would have made the wisdom and witticisms work. As it is, Bagger just comes across as a vaudeville act, rather than a vagrant that has seen the wear and tear of life, including the downtrodden world that a black man would have experienced at that point in time. America in the 20's was not that far removed from the slave days and the reflections on long gone relatives and friends would have worked with middle age as a bridge. Great part, just not enough mileage on the actor.",8,3,8,12 July 2005
National Treasure," Relax! It's 'The Goonies' with grownups!!
","OK, gang, chill out. Everyone wants to get philosophical about what this one isn't. And what it is is a lot of fun with grownups instead of Sean Astin chasing One-Eyed Willie's treasure! Take it for what it is. Even my 18 year old liked it! It's a perfect example of how you can still put a story up there that is interesting and doesn't have to say a damn thing. 'Star Wars' did it years ago and caught hell from the people who said it was just a big-screen comic book. While this is no 'Star Wars', it's the same concept. Have fun with it and quit trying to dissect it like it's a lab specimen. Or make it say something it doesn't.",Null,0,0,27 November 2004
