The Blair Witch Project," OK
","When the movie first came out everyone said it was a great movie because it was something new then about a year after it got rubbished by everyone then I saw it. I think people make up their minds before they have even sat in the cinema or put the disc or tape in the machine. (in fact between you and me I think some people reviews on imdb are wrote when they haven't seen the movie because they just dont care to watch it so they write a made up review)  BWP is a good movie and creepy in places. Remember some of the lame cheap shots that hollywood horror movie go for just to get a quick scare well BWP doesnt go down that road. Like or loath, 7/10",Null,0,1,3 November 2003
The Ring," not great
",No where near as good as the Japanese original which scared the crap out of me with it's superb sound effects and filming. Hollywood always has to muck it up. PLEASE see the original and don't let the subtitles put you off. 4/10,Null,1,2,31 October 2003
The Others," one big mess
","it trys hard to be many things, one minute it's a drama then a thriller then a horror flick and it doesnt hit the spot with any of them. It has some chilling moments but not really creepy enough to leave you glancing over your shoulder at the creaking hallway door as you watch I was looking at mine but only out of boredom. Kidman has only one face the whole movie but the talented children make up for her limited acting. Making a movie of mixture should be thought over i cant help but think it was rushed. The ending wasnt a total surprize but was done well. The rollercoster they wanted it to be is more of a merry go round.",Null,0,0,3 June 2002
American Pie," with a helping of cream
","I normally run away when I'm near teen movies even quicker when they are a comedy. Yet I sat and watched it and found it a bit of a crude teehee. One things that stood out was how much it was like me and my mates. The average joe, the posh camp one, sporty one, cute ok one with a gf and the dumb loud jerk half friend who you dont really like and cant get rid of. I'll let you guess which one I am. It's a hard life when you are a young male and you can't find 'it' for love nor money. So watch it and think back at the best/worst years of your life.",Null,0,0,29 July 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," good stuff
","SPOILER! Lots of big sci-fi flicks have come and gone since T2 so I had my doubts whether this was going to be any good or I'd feel the same but right from the start I got into it. I also had doubts about the female terminator but it wasn't too corny still the T1000 was more menacing. I figured out how they would kill the T-X when I saw the damaged energy cell explode in the desert and I never figure endings out. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was much better than the other two yet a little depressing. Ok so what didn't I like, I wish this were made a few years earlier, the whole feel was more ominous and we got to see some more future battles and more cool new machines (T-4 anyone?) 8/10",9,1,1,4 April 2004
Resident Evil," not bad
",Havent played any of the games so had no extra reason to watch other why i'd normally watch a film. First off I knew that 'Rain'(Michelle Rodriguez) would annoy the feet off me with that dumb mean look she feel she must have on her face and was waiting for it getting ripped off. Second I wish Colin Salmon had more of a role as he just out shined everyone on with him that moment with his strong voice and presence also it's nice to see a black man in a movie these days that isn't all 'yo yo big it up da bong me boy' 7/10,Null,0,0,11 June 2003
Men in Black II," waste of time
","after the joke that was 'wild wild west' and the painfully annoying flop 'Ali' Smith needed something to get back some respect but all this movie seems to be is a load of yes men milking his huge ego. I found it boring and now where near as enjoyable as MIB. Also Mr Smith PLEASE spare us anymore of your soundtracks that you feel we all need, 'nod your head' more like 'bow your head (in shame)'",Null,0,0,5 September 2002
Spectre," Oh my lord this was boring!!
","SPOILERS. It started badly after the smooth intro when Bond does some sniping thirty feet away from the target barely concealing himself then shocked when he is spotted then we get an overly choppy action scene so hacked together and swirly it's not watchable.After some unnatural chit chat with M Bond talks with a new guy 'C' oh he doesn't come across as shifty, I'm surprised he wasn't winking at the camera after every line.Blah blah seduces a grieving widow (oh come on!) At Q branch, somehow steals a high tech car and takes it abroad. We meet Blofeld.... where is the menace in this character? he was like that boring cousin you avoid at weddings.More yawn and drag with more choppy action.The humorous parts were welcomed but Daniel Craig can't do them because he only has four facial expressions.The trouble with Spectre is they made them far to grand and in control of everything but equally inept. The next movie should have an instrumental theme to play it safe. The man singing sounds like he was eating a sandwich. Most of the last ten themes are crap.Bring back some of the charm.5/10 and 3 of those were for bringing back Spectre.",5,2,6,29 November 2015
