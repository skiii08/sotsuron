Ford v Ferrari," 'Sometimes they don't come out of car'
","What a great movie! Great plot, great acting by Matt Demon and Christian Bale. One of the best scene ever i watched in the history of Hollywood and it is in the end of this movie when Kem miles wants to end the lap together and later discovers that he was betrayed and after knowing that he still doesn't get sad or take any action because he knows that who is the real winner and he knows that he the champion.When i saw that trailer, i had thought it would be like creation of Ferrari and Ford cars and had thought it would be race between Matt and Bale but it was totally beyond my thoughts.Climax of this movie was pretty impressive.",8,1,1,8 February 2020
Catch Me If You Can," Outstanding, amazing and more thrilling.
","This is one of the best and most underrated movie of leonardo dicaprio's. Outstanding performance by leo and tom hanks. Movie has such a great suspense and dramatic emotions. What can i say more about that how excellent he is at pretending in this movie by fooling all the people no matter wherever he goes. Being pilot, a doctor and lawyer and then a F.B.I agent. I just loved it when a thought came into my mind that whole F.B.I was chasing him and wanted him to down but in the end he is working for the F.B.I how cool is that, huh? The acting of Tom hanks is no doubt he is a outstanding actor. Leo's acting is what make me humble every time. Man, what i brilliant actor he is.

Notting Hill," Unexpectedly beautiful.
","Let me get through it, how i became so obsessed with this movie, i was just rolling channels on my home TV and i was just checking out same TV channels with the different programs and eventually, i got myself at HBO, there was a scene when a random woman which i considered at that time, walked-in in some kind of book store and was looking for the guy (William Wacker) and then he came and struck up with the most deep proposal conversation. I listened that and watched that scene so desperately and i loved it, As the movie went ahead, there came a most beautiful scene i have ever seen on TV when the William Wacker and Anna Scott sitting on the bench and William reading a book while holding a hand of her and there is baby in her womb. I figured that scene and that moment in the movie as one of the most beautiful and charming scene. I really felt so much in that scene and learnt many of things that i can enhance in myselfAfter a week, i searched for this film and download it so i can see it from the very beginning. So, here i am, finished the movie just now and reviewing it at last. The whole movie is mixed with the Drama, Romance, Family typed, and hilarious. The acting of Hugh Grant, Oh, my goodness, he is such a brilliant actor. He has beautiful face, acting skills and really good acting behavior. I have now just considered this movie as my favourite one. It has such a great plot, characters, sets and beautiful alleys of London. I found Hugh Grant so much talented actor as for his authentic acting skills. He's really great hairstyle. The character of William Wacker is so naive and respectable to me.Movie has very logically and sensing making scenes that i have adored the most. Love Notting Hill forever.",9,2,2,22 January 2020

","This kind of movie that i was expecting it would be like for another level, which would be totally badass or totally realistic but believe, it has left me with not the actually disappointments but with the not making sense, as the trailer came out, felt really great and was hyped to see but as i watched it last night, i really didn't like it for one minute because there wasn't really a authentic scene where i was supposed to be excited or get inspired, it is just dull kind of story where things weren't matching. As i talk about Joaquin Phoenix, he did really great as with his facial expressions, his body language, his freak laughing it was real thing to see but i still didn't like the movie. I was expecting more and better kind of things but fine and good movie.In simple words: Overrated movie of the year.",4,3,12,16 November 2019

Back to the Future Part II," One of the best time-traveling movie i have ever seen.
","Well, who has said that 80's movies couldn't be fantastic and amazing, i can witness about this movie that this is the greatest time-travel and spectacular of all time. One of the credit i wan to give to Christopher Lloyd aka DOC, the acting of this guy in this movie is just authentic, this is how scientist looks like and works in really life, i really loved the way he has performed just as pure scientist, he just portrayed the character so politely and don't you forget about the Michael J. Fox he is also skillful guy.Movie has so many twists and so many breathtaking scenes which you would admire for sure and movie is at his best. The thing that took me to is when they got back to the 1995, they have showed it exactly the same way which was showed in part one and those were absolutely best scenes i have ever encountered. I can certainly say that this time-travel movie is far better than Avengers: End game because it has so many mind blowing scenes.I really loved this one and the previous one, now looking forward for the third one.",9,0,1,21 August 2019
