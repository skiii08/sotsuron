National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Sorry No Treasure Here.
","Well, I guess I should have known going into this one that it was going to have absolutely no plot. The whole film is based on some notion of family honor. Basically Nicolas Cage was so sick of being considered a wacko for all those years that the second anyone tried to trash his name he was up for a fight. Is this not the biggest crock? I mean, it's based on the premise, that if your distant relatives did bad things you should: A) Feel extremely bad for said acts even though you had nothing to do with them. B) Give extreme credit and worry to those who would look down on you for this and C) Risk life and limb and also endanger the lives of others to clear your dead relatives of said bad accusations. What an awful justification for all of his acts! I think there are many many people in this country that have relatives whom have engaged in horrible things (i.e. slavery, extermination of Native Americans, etc..) I hope they are not prone to engage in A,B, or C of the above.So, with the foundation of a horrible 'goal' in mind we are painfully pulled through two hours of the first national treasure movie once again just without the surprise of Gates' bold and illegal moves There was just absolutely no shock when it was like 'we have to go to the White House! Again.. (enter dramatic music Dun dun dun.) All the magic of the first movies was wonderfully duplicated making this movie predictable in the extreme.Sure it was historically, and geographically a mess with Mt.Rushmore being right over the hill from a nice lake, ancient South American empires in a South Dakota basement, etc Oh, by the way, the two romantic characters of the first movie that appeared in many the cute and charming scenes that fell in love after the whole ordeal. Yea those two, well they are separated (not divorced) and one of them is kissing on other men. Sorry, didn't last long. I know what can get them back together! Another great adventure! So just to recap that one, they had 'cleared their name' for such a short time that this whole trek was necessary to return honor to the family but the love of the two was so strong in the end of the final movie only lasted that long. Hum Can I get my 15 bucks back? Wait for the video or at least the cheap seats!",2,21,30,28 December 2007
I Am Legend," I AM not impressed with most movies but I AM digging I AM Legend!
","I am not impressed with most movies but I am digging I am Legend!I will first start out by mentioning in this review as I have said before that I am not impressed with the vast majority of movies cranked out by Hollywood these days. Its even more seldom when I find a movie that I truly enjoySome of the negative reviews are well taken and I can see why some people may not buy the movie but I will attempt to explain why I do.I am legend is just the right balance of action/thriller/scary/thinker type movie. I was not expecting this when I walked into the theater. I was more expecting a scary movie with Will Smith walking around in the dark blowing creatures heads off for two hours I was glad to see that it did not do this.I am Legend takes you directly into the action and the setup of the movie. I just remember thinking during the first three minutes of the movie that I was very thankful that we did not have to sit through a half hour rising-action of how the earth got infected, exactly what happened, and why he is the only one left. It is my opinion that these details were not simply omitted by the other as a point of oversight and neglect but I believe they were purposefully left out. Furthermore, they added to the post-movie think about it factor to the whole thing.The sense of loneliness and isolation was awesome from the get go. From the talking to manikins to the re-run TV Will Smith does a great job of setting up the character in a desperate state but still retaining the Will Smith comedy factor, very well played.The movie continued to keep me on the edge of my seat! I loved the scene when he chases the dog into the abandoned warehouse. Such awesome suspense and very cryptic imagesAll in all the movie left me with some great discussion points and questions to think about1. Was the trap that Will Smith got caught in set by himself or the infected humans? (did he place the manikin there in a schizophrenic episode caused by extreme isolating or did they figure it out) 2. How smart are the infected humans? He says they had complete 'social devolution' but they seem to still retain the ability to employ lesser animals (they had dogs on leashes in the trap scene). This implies that they still retained some human abilities. 3. Why did the infected humans want to kill him so bad? If they are so desperate for food why don't they just kill each other? Or the dogs they had? Clearly they did not just want to eat him. 4. How is this 'cure the world' thing going to work? Can the creatures reproduce? They found a cure great, but how are they going to go about reclaiming the world? 5. EtcAll in all this was an excellent movie. I will for sure pay the $12 to see it again this time in IMAX format!",9,1,2,16 December 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Too Short, Too Little, TOO LATE!
","THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! CAUTION!!!Fist off I must admit that I have watched the previous movies too many times to count Since I watched the last movie I have read the books (I had not read them before this movie). This book was the turning point for me in the whole Harry Potter series. In my opinion the story goes from good to excellent in OOTP. With that said, I had some pretty big expectations for this movie, some of which where realized.The high points of the movie where seeing the fruition of some of the more lovable elements of the book such as Weasley's Wheezes, Tonks, Askaban, Kretcher, and the OOTP Head Quarters. It was fun to see the characters but it was hard to see such main characters like Tonks totally be ignored by the story. I mean I had such hope when she was pulling faces at the dinner table then after that, nothing. The movie really just cut too many corners to the point that it did not look as amazing as it could have been. I mean the ministry of magic looked like a hallway and that's it, Sirius' family apparently lived in the connect-a-house projects, and Cho was border line illiterate! I don't think that movies have to follow the books exactly, for example, I think Lord of the Rings did an awesome job at condensing one of the most complex and awesome stories of our time into 12hrs of movie. But the movies do have to make sense.I asked my wife after the movie (she has not read any HP books) if it made sense (because he continuity and back-story of the movie was not easy to follow for me) and she said yes. I just worry that the movies are so out of control at this point that peeves, Hermione & Ron's Prefect Status, Percy going bad, Quidditch, the Dursley's, Trelawny, etc All those stories are now so corrupted and twisted by screen writes and directors that they can not (in my imagination) be reasonably recovered.My Suggestions:1. If your going to make us wait two years between movies at least put in enough film to cover the subject. Why not do a 2 part (or dare I say 3) part movie. If you need help spending your production time wisely see Peter Jackson. (Really I know that this would never happen, but hey) 2. Try and get the story back on track. Some how. 3. Lets see the actors! (Really Lupin, Snape, Hagrid, McGonagall, did you have another gig? Were where they?",2,49,80,12 July 2007
