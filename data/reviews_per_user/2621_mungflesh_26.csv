The Hangover," Not to all tastes
","From the beginning, I kept getting the feeling that the movie's story and laughs were due to kick in any minute, right around the corner, about to happen in the next scene. This never happened.I did manage to force a laugh once or twice and the plot kept me interested to watch to the end but it was a bit of a chore. The only character with any depth and realism was the dentist. The other lead actors did not have enough substance, in order to draw humour out of the situations they were planted in.I think this is a brand of American humour which is not to my taste, though I can see why it would appeal to some other tastes. It's very much about exchanges of 1-liner insults, so if you find this funny, the movie will probably appeal. South Park come to mind as a similar genre and perhaps, going back a while, movies like Caddyshack or Smokey and the Bandit.For me, disappointing.",5,0,2,17 April 2010
Iron Man 3," If it only had a heart ...
","This is an unexpected pooper from Marvel, who have been pretty solid with their releases until now.So what should we expect from an Iron Man movie? Tony Stark fighting bad guys in his hi-tech suit, right? Well IM3 has very, very little of that and plenty of super hero 'down-time', as can be expected in such genre pieces where the screenplay doesn't know how to deal with the fact that the central character can't be in hero mode throughout.From having recently dealt with an alien invasion in 'The Avengers', Tony Stark is in comparatively dreadful form as an Iron Man whose gadgets repeatedly malfunction, and are more like aluminum foil than iron, based on how easily some of the bad guys manage to damage and destroy them.IM3 is reasonably entertaining though, with some very enjoyable and witty lines delivered from time to time but unfortunately that's about its best feature. A convoluted plot with little to no true Iron Man action make it seem like a bad franchise offering, rather than a full- blown, in house Marvel monster. You'll find it easier following a John Le Carr√© story than this, probably.",5,48,95,29 April 2013
It," A decent next attempt at IT
","This 2017 production of Stephen King's book is a well-crafted, decently acted imagining of the story. I really enjoyed it but did speak to some people who were disappointed that it had diverged from the book too much.In brief, the children of Derry are going missing at an alarming rate. Something evil lurks in the town and it's up to the Loser's Club to overcome their fear and unite to confront IT ...I found the old TV movie somewhat dull in the second half. The first half, which this movie is concerned with, was always the stronger half and I think this version is probably just as good, if not better than the original TV movie. It's certainly more gruesome and scary.I'm not sure Tim Curry's Pennywise has been upstaged though. Bill Skarsgard has done a good job but I think Curry's is hard to beat.IT 2017 is refreshingly old-school, in that it focuses on character and story, unlike too many recent 'horror' movies. It is beautifully shot and superbly acted but perhaps could move at a slightly better pace.IT will divide opinions due to story vs screenplay issues but it's definitely not a bad remake.",7,39,76,7 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," At last - a decent, new Stars Wars movie
","What a return to form for Star Wars! I've seen this twice already and the second time was pretty much as exhilarating at the first. It's not just 'not crap' - it's actually great, and the first time in a while I didn't want a movie to end.I won't go into the story details. Star Wars fans should know what this is about and those who aren't fans are a bit hopeful by this point in time if they think watching the latest one will change their minds. Those who are somewhere in between are more likely to enjoy this than the prequels.Episode 7 had promise but Abrams' movie fell short. He fixed the issues that everyone had been griping about since the prequels, except that he brought a bunch of new ones instead (like too much pop culture and forced attempts at comic relief).Rogue 1 is really well written. There's such a huge difference between this and the prequels, or Episode 7. The story manages to stay interesting and coherent throughout, without glaring contradictions to itself or the rest of the franchise. The characters become interesting quickly, and you do end up giving a damn about them by the end of the film.Like kids in candy stores, Lucas and Abrams both made these movies with too much new technology at their disposals and too many potential ideas flying around; restraint was required on both their parts. Gareth Edwards, on the other hand has managed to get the ingredients right and, dare I say it, takes the franchise to a few new places.Rogue 1 is not the powerhouse of a movie that The Empire Strikes Back is but it does offer, ironically, A New Hope for the Star Wars universe.",9,112,201,28 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Frivolous fun
","Captain Marvel is just about on the right side of entertaining. It's way above the turkey threshold but falls short of the accolade of good.It's the standard Marvel template: our heroine is presented as someone trying to find their place in the universe, they go on an unexpected journey - battling some bad guys - and eventually discover their true power.The effects are dated. Cartoonish and unremarkable. Thor (2011) had better FX. The narrative is something of a mess: flashbacks to future events and substandard plot twists make for an uneccessarily confusing watch. More effort should have been made to flesh out the new characters and keep the story simple. There are few people who we can identify with - including Carol Danvers - because introductions to new characters and worlds are all too brief.These are the main flaws and the Marvel releases of late have tended to be of a similar standard, so Captain Marvel doesn't fall way short. It's just that the benchmark is quite low.On a positive note, Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel is a likeable and interesting character, if a bit ambiguous. Brie Larson does the job well and fits in nicely with the longstanding universe characters, ie. SHIELD. Some nice comic touches are woven into the script as usual, without being too out-of-place.Overall, the film held my interest, despite the muddled start and standard lull that all super hero movies seem compelled to have in the middle (a tradtion upheld since Superman 2, 1980).",6,2,6,18 March 2019
Dawn of the Dead," Old vs New
","Before I say anything about the movie I'd like to add my 2cents on the old vs new argument.Hold the thought that 'the old one was pants because ...'. Just bear in mind that in 20 years time people might be saying the same thing about the current one. Does that affect what you think of the movie when you see it now?The original Dawn of the Dead does look lame in many ways in comparison to the remake, but how could it not on a $1.5million budget compared to however many multiples of that budget the new one cost? If a movie could be weighed on the ratio of box office takings to budget, the remake would probably have to scrape $1bn to match the original's performance.Now here's what I think of the 2004 one.[potential SPOILERS follow]A great opening and introduction to the characters. Sfx/gore pretty impressive so far but nothing to really make me cringe. The threat of the zombies is well realised and the sense of claustrophobia as with the Romero originals is achieved very quickly.Now comes the middle section full of tension and 'how are they going to get out of here' questions arising. A few more faces get introduced. Fat woman - pretty gross.Pointless bit in basement where somebody dies and then they get back upstairs. Sorry, so they've gained a dog - not pointless. Definitely better however and more concise than the really drawn out bit in DOTD 78 where David Emge plays basement zombie hide and seek for 10mins.Zombie baby - sod off you're crap. Second most pointless thing after zombie vs shark scene in Lucio Fulci's imaginatively titled 'Zombie'. Oh hang on I forgot the zombie family in The Video Dead (the worst film of all time). Anyway, hate the baby - what's up next?Here comes the biggest drawback of the movie so far. The disease is only spread if you're bitten. This is VERY 28 days later and really should have followed the Romero theme where the *dead* are coming back to life and not just the bitten who then died. For me, that's what was really scary in the first place because there really was no way of stopping it. People die every few seconds.Now the tough blonde lady brags to shoot man after he's dead. (Sarcasm)Well I don't know, whatever could be coming later then? A suggestion: in order to achieve the unpredictability of the Romero movies you'd have to start by reversing that one and have the guy shoot the woman after *she* were dead or something. Surely it's more likely to scare people if they *don't* know what's coming?Now if like me you're from the Romero school of thought and you've been used to the baddies getting their just-desserts at the hands of the hungry zombies you were probably waiting for that super-gory climax ... which never happens. Yeah they chainsaw some zombies and a poor girl gets sawed in the shoulder (the highlight of the fx for me) but no drawn out ripping to pieces of those that deserve it; no guts & organ munching for the undead. Real light snackers these Snyder zombies, always up for a quick bite but nothing more. Surprising seeing as they have so much energy.The ending? It's more of a stop than an end. Not poor though.Overall, I've been pretty nitpicky with the above comments but then this film *did* have the budget where DOTD 78 did not so I'm backing the underdog.If you've not yet seen either then I would recommend seeing the remake first as it is definitely more current and it'd be unlikely that you would not enjoy it. Although I've not stated them, this film *does* have many good scenes and ideas and will go down as a respectable remake. However, if you're a true zombie movie fan and have seen a few low-budget movies in your time then it's gotta be the original seen first and the remake after.Recommended 7.5/10",7,0,0,1 April 2004
The Irishman," Good but weak for Scorsese
","An elderly Mob hitman (De Niro) recalls the people he knew (Pesci, Pacino) and the decisions he took which defined him.I think knowing a bit about the subject matter might have helped with this movie. Scorsese takes for granted the fact his audience know what's gradually unfolding. I didn't and although it's coherent and well scripted, it's lacking tension and, in the first half, a sense of direction. I suspect on subsequent viewings it will come together more nicely.Whilst not on the same level as Goodfellas, Wolf of Wall Street or Taxi Driver, it's still a decent film but its length does it no favours.The main negatives, aside from the running time, are the awful use of CG to make the cast younger and the cartoonish blood effects when people are shot. The choice to use ageing actors and youngify them rather than young ones, with prosthetic make up, proves a bit odd looking.It's a good movie but one of Scorsese's weaker ones.",7,4,7,3 December 2019
Cloverfield," A fun 90 mins
","I was expecting this movie to be a bit more scary. That's my main gripe. Nothing really bad happens to the characters (on screen) so no real fear is conjured up. It's scary in the same way the movie 'Earthquake' was scary, ie. like a disaster movie, not a horror movie.This might be your bag but I needed more to make me feel the fear I would have, had I have been in NYC during the onslaught.The fx are great and I think future monster movies will use more of this first-person approach to drive home realism. The monster is killer.The acting's *ok* and doesn't really let the film down but is questionable in places of high emotion. Towards the end, I just yearned to watch people get eaten or something.To sum up: a fun 90 mins but didn't knock my socks off.",7,1,3,19 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Dazzling CGI effects a good Star Wars do not make
","Don't get me wrong - this film is awesome. I was really blown away, especially by the closing battle sequence with Count Dooku. Possibly the best of all 5 so far but the continual onslaught of millions of CGI's at 0.5 past light speed are very hard to get to grips with at times. With the exception of light-sabre confrontations, the large battles scenes in the original 3 movies were alot more gripping. Using small groups of combatants makes for better audience involvement, such as the chase through the Death Star in IV, the classic asteroid field sequence in V and the speeder bike pursuit in VI - which is why the light sabre duels always come across well. I used to think Stormtroopers were a dumb bunch but they're elite forces compared to the dime-a-billion battle-droids. Quality, not quantity and well-used, not over-used CGI would make for a flawless Episode III.",6,0,0,22 May 2002
Bohemian Rhapsody," Really enjoyable
","I'm not a huge Queen fan, I like their music but wouldn't invest in any album - save for the Flash Gordon soundtrack.But this movie was amazing. Couldn't care less if it's not accurate. As a film, it has a great feel good factor and is very enjoyable.It could possibly have involved the other members of the band a bit more but I can't say that would have improved the film tremendously.",9,5,7,10 November 2018
Baby Driver," Reasonably Neat Neat Neat
","Baby Driver is a fun film with nothing too offensive, or unfortunately thrilling, to make any real waves. It has a few too many clich√©s in it to be taken seriously but they don't detract hugely from the viewing experience.Jamie Foxx is about the best thing, acting and character-wise but that's not saying a whole lot. However, nothing in the cast is so appauling that it spoils the film. Kevin Spacey's character comes close though, as the somewhat nerdy looking but oh so terribly tough gangster that seems to come for free with most movies of this kind nowadays.It's a good fun popcorn movie without being just a load of typical studio CGI garbage but don't expect a serious thriller. Think Pulp Fiction without the wit or originality.My review might sound a bit scathing but I did find it to be a good watch, if at times I had to grit my teeth silently.",7,0,3,4 January 2018
The Shining," 'Go check it out !!'
","I first saw the 110 min version when I was 14 and was disappointed but have since grown to love the longer 140min+ film. I've never found it scary, only unsettling at best but what I think Kubrick manages really well is to portray the sense of seeing someone you know turn into someone you don't (ie Jack Torrence). The film as a whole does not work very well - it's the scene-by-scene thing that makes it great, the best of them being perhaps the Wendy with baseball bat sequence.Personally, I think this is one of Kubrick's best. There are many things to enjoy - you might need to watch it a few times to find them all but chances are any expectations you have prior to viewing will not be met, this is Kubrick creation after all and he doesn't tend to follow the puffin genre-guidebook to making movies.",10,0,0,4 September 2001
The Conjuring 2," An uncommonly strong sequel
","The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in. By that, I mean you're pretty much in the thick of it from the get-go, being given some background (via another very notorious haunting incident) for what is to follow.The Warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in Enfield, England and, as per the first movie, they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation. Once again, a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives. There are a few new twists this time round, so all does not play out as before - but it's not a complete departure from the format, which might have made it a bit more gripping in places.James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. Wan has really done a great job of this, which is surprising given that he's not from there. Also, the central support role of Janet Hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the Enfield family and Madison Wolfe gives a solid performance.It's arguable this one is as strong as the first. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one, or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme.Some awesome, unsettling and creepy music in places too.",8,206,282,2 June 2016
The Butterfly Effect," One of the best films this decade
","On second viewing, lots of subtleties emerge, which I had missed the first time round, further strengthening the storyline.The performances are not Oscar-winning stuff but the storyline is great. It's very fast paced and doesn't get bogged down with too many sci-fi details trying to explain itself; the viewer is left to make up their own mind about that stuff.Forget the alternative ending, it would ruin the film. The director's ending is the correct ending and the one I saw first on DVD.I believe this film is one of those word-of-mouth movies that in time becomes very popular, similar to The Shawshank Redemption.",8,0,1,28 February 2006
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Spread thin, like butter scraped over too much bread
","I think The Desolation of Smaug will polarize viewers on its action sequences: either you'll love them, and that in itself will make the movie a success, or you will, like me, find them far too dragged-out and unnecessarily embellished in comparison to that which was quite concise in the original story.That being said, Jackson's fifth venture into the Tolkien Universe is still on form, if being fair. Desolation of Smaug is an entertaining watch whose main flaw is its length. The Lord of the Rings worked as a twelve hour epic because there was simply that much story to be told. The Hobbit is really just a two hour movie drawn out and padded to feel more Rings-y. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the title role has been marginalized, in favor of some of the bigger characters. In the book, Thorin plays part of the sub-plot, not the main plot, but this role seems to have been swapped with Bilbo's, which is a shame because Martin Freeman is well cast as Bilbo and brings the right mix of sincerity and humor to the part.In short, Jackson's expansions in the story don't add much except to pad the movie, which in more generic terms might be referred to as poorly edited. I'd say that with Desolation of Smaug, Jackson has not improved on the first movie but The Hobbit continues to faithfully represent what is in the book and is roughly as good as the book but the additions add up to nothing.",6,1,6,16 December 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Fun nostalgia and thrills from a fan boy director who is basically a big kid
","This is arguably Tarantino's most clever movie and is great that he hasn't compromised. If he had, it wouldn't be the future cult classic it is destined to be.It's 1969 and the sun is setting on a Hollywood legend's career. He and his stunt double are hopeful that the good times are not yet over.Featuring delightful star 'cameos' and lavish shots which ooze 60's nostalgia, OUATIH makes no attempt to be follow any genre rules. The story, at face value appears to be mundane and a bit pointless.If you know nothing of the history surrounding this moment in time, the movie will appear to be going nowhere but I was feeling the crushing tension of what was building, very slowly, throughout the film.It's hard to talk at length without revealing too much; the finale was, for me, a triumph.OUATIH is filled with Tarantino's shameless, naive exuberance and will either have you buzzing or groaning by the end. It won't work for everyone.",8,1,3,11 December 2019
The Mist," This one goes in the 'Good King Adaptation' bag
","I had managed to miss all the trailers and publicity for this film until a colleague mentioned it to me yesterday morning. I was straight out that very evening to see it.I read the novella about 20 years earlier, as part of the book 'Skeleton Crew', which was one of the best parts of that book. All I could remember from it was something about spiders and slicing web-strands and an immense hoofed thing. To my delight, all of these appeared on the big screen and the story seemed to be close to the original too.The army being the cause of it all spoiled it somewhat but the explanation of how they caused it was quite good I thought. Overall, it would have arguably been better to retain the purity of King's story. The ending was a disappointment; for once being actually too nasty for my liking. Whilst not as gut-wrenching, King's ending was more chilling.Average fx (I'm very anti-cgi) were made up for by great performances. This is where we notice the quality of a solid director like Darabont. I'm not in the 'shawshank is #1' camp but Frank is very competent. Thank heaven a team with the 'Blockbuster' mentality didn't pick this one up, else we'd have had one-liners all the way through like 'now that's what I call a close encounter' or 'he had to split', alongside vest-wearing women with rocket launchers 'kicking-ass' and doing kung foo. I get cold sweats thinking about it.Best film I've seen in a while and probably one of the best horror films this decade. The religious nut is the star of the show. Thanks, Frank - now do The Stand!",9,1,4,8 July 2008
The Longest Day," Best of its era
","As a movie, this one is definitely one of the greatest ever made. An incredible cast and, for a movie with several directors, superbly seamless.However, it has definitely reached its sell-by date because of the many variations of war movie and changing attitudes to war over the years. This and Saving Private Ryan are the genre leaders for this historical event and therefore comparisons between the two are inevitable.The Longest Day is like a diluted version of Saving Private Ryan - you get a lot more but much less strength. Where Private Ryan chooses to dissect the real effects of war on the individual, this movie shows as many aspects of D-Day as possible to provide a complete, unbiased view of the events (we see the war as viewed from the outside rather than the inside). For example, I think the scale of the D-Day invasion is realised in Longest Day, but not in Private Ryan, where I found the opening sequence harrowing but somewhat like a small commando attack rather than the largest invasion ever staged.
A great piece of cinema but, like most war movies of the day, fails to communicate what war was REALLY like.",9,1,2,9 October 2001
Clash of the Titans," Zeus's BUTTHOLE
","In short, this is yet another remake that fails to live up to its parent original.There have been a few plot re-arrangements, which I felt might have been interesting, but ultimately amounted to not a lot. The main thing I noticed, is the role of Calibos seems to have diminished somewhat, together with the whole riddle & burn thing. This in itself did not detract too much but its just one thing in a long list.The Medusa sequence, the 'prize fight' if you will, has become a bit of a Tom & Jerry slapstick moment. Medusa nips around like a hamster in a cage, playing peek-a-boo, failing to bring any sense of dread with her.The Kraken, which had every chance to thrill, given CGI's advantage over stop-motion, was pretty run of the mill. We've seen all this before over the past decade - nothing new brought to the table here.However, it's the woefully stale performances, character development and screenplay which, for me, drag the film down above all else. Perseus is regularly upstaged by all those around him, making each rushed scene a bit of a free-for-all.Having recently seen the original after many years away, I was disappointed that it hadn't aged better but after seeing the remake, that's not such a big deal.",5,3,4,7 October 2010
Midsommar," Sweden's Green Inferno
","A group of PhD students are invited to a commune in Sweden by their friend (who's from there). It turns out to be more of an experience than they'd bargained for.The movie is very well made and Ari Aster is clearly a man with a plan but whilst it has vibes of The Shining and The Wicker Man, it's lacking the good stuff we saw in both.Disturbing visuals and imagery are constantly diluted by overly drawn out scenes and, in some cases, stuff which is frankly hard not to just laugh at.But the main drawback, I found, is how it relies too much on the PhD kids being about as naive as people can possibly be. This made for a tedious second half of 'don't go in the basement' style goofs.I loved Hereditary, which scared the pants off me, but Midsommar is more akin to Hereditary's ending than its remainder.But it's worth watching and will provoke plenty of discussion and it is more refreshing than many horrors around at the moment, if a bit annoying. If nothing else, trips to IKEA will feel different.",7,1,1,12 November 2019
Avatar," An impartial review
","I was reluctant to go see this as I'm not sold on the 3D craze, which is currently sweeping the cinema-world. I had seen 'Up' and 'Fly me to the moon' before this and was expecting more or less the same. In my opinion, that's what I got.James Cameron is a master at creating stories, characters and relationships which the viewer can empathise with. He's no genius but he is solid.It's no surprise that Avatar is now the biggest grossing movie of all time. It's got all the ingredients of a mainstream smash and almost executes to perfection, but that's all it is really. Elements of the story are terribly clich√©d; some parts are borderline silly, and there's nothing in the action sequences we haven't seen elsewhere before, it's just bigger and more 3d-er in this movie. It could also arguably be a bit shorter. I did find myself yawning on the odd occasion.For kids (eg 7-15), this would be the ride of a lifetime. It's a bit too rough for younger viewers but the editing has been handled really well, to make this accessible for a wide demographic. There's no blood n' guts but it's not exactly the A-Team either. Think 'Return of the King' and you've got a similar level of violence.To summarise, it's great but not mind-blowing. As for the 3D, I found that by the end, I was oblivious to it, which is the same for good old 2D.",6,1,2,1 February 2010
Sinister," Grown men screaming in the theatre!
","I saw this last night at the theatre. It's the scariest, most tense horror film I have seen on the big screen since I saw Candyman 20 years ago and it's probably the scariest film I have seen since I saw The Ring, on DVD, about 10 years ago.Sinister's clever use of sound and its creepy music score, a-la Candyman, is its biggest asset. I say an Oscar is deserved for Christopher Young who has outdone himself with sublime arrangements which bring depth and real terror alongside the visuals.By instilling fear from the outset and implying a dreadful fate to the protagonist (which the viewer is hoping can be avoided but ultimately knows is lurking at the end), Sinister takes its influence from The Ring and keeps the tension building throughout the movie. It becomes almost unbearable in places! Whilst it doesn't really avoid the standard horror clich√©s of the last decade, Sinister manages to retain just enough credibility to keep the fear simmering in the audience. The film is not without its flaws though. You might find yourself shaking your head on the odd occasion and the story, whilst decent and played out with good tempo, treads the fine line between supernatural and reality and, in my opinion, gets it slightly wrong but it's not really enough to spoil the result.My adrenaline levels, after watching this, kept me from sleeping for another 3 hours, so be warned. It's been a while since I heard grown men scream in the cinema ...",8,21,35,15 October 2012
The Secret Life of Pets," Family animation with a traditional feel
","The Secret Life of Pets is a very family friendly, warm and fun movie. It has less of the tiresome pop-culture gags in it than some other animated releases, keeping the humour within more traditional themes as say an older Disney movie might do which renders it very suitable for anyone of any age.The story follows a group of downtown New York city pets, two of whom run into some trouble during their routine 'walkies'. There's not much more to it than this, aside from the micro plots in each quick-fire set piece and the introduction of (perhaps a few too many) other animals but it is for kids and it does well to keep their attention for the ninety-odd minutes.It features great vocal performances and nice (if unadventurous) animation. You won't see anything groundbreaking in this movie and it is unlikely to be one that's talked about much as time goes on, as it is weaker than the likes of How to Train Your Dragon or The Incredibles but if you're looking for a child friendly trip to the movies, this is arguably a good choice.I'm not a huge animation fan (if you take a look at my other reviews) but I did not feel hard done by after seeing this one.",6,4,12,19 June 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Nothing wrong here
","I would by lying if I had to rate this film less than 8/10 but then if I was asked 'what's so great about it?' I would have to reply 'well, nothing really - it's just a good film'.I very much doubt that anyone who looks critically at movies can really see this as anything more than a really good made-for-TV movie. It's like the Bjorn Borg of movies: you can't fault it but what else is there to it?We need more 'McEnroes' and 'Agassis' with flair and style which go beyond what we expect from movies that are simply good.Mungflesh Factor 8/10",8,0,1,30 September 2004
The Conjuring," New life breathed into a classic sub-genre
","'Don't summon the devil, don't call the priest ...'I was one of a lucky few to have seen The Conjuring at a preview screening for FrightFest 2013.I went in totally cold, not having seen a trailer, nor knowing anything about the story or plot and it turned out to be one of the best scary horror movies I have ever seen.The Conjuring is a nail-biting, hiding-behind-hands movie. If you've been disappointed with the likes of Paranormal Acivity and Insidious, this one is likely to deliver in areas where they failed.It tells the supposedly true story of two paranormal investigators, who aim to rid families and properties of their suspected supernatural visitations, either by disproving them (if they turn out to be just creaky floorboards or slamming doors) or tackling them head-on if not. A leap of faith is required to buy into this theme but if you're okay with it, then the movies plays out pretty well within its genre confines.The particular incident they are brought in to deal with is described as surrounding a spirit 'so malevolent' it was hidden from the public until only now. In fairly Amityville-like circumstances, a family move into a new house and discover the basement is sealed; boarded-up behind a doorway.It's not at all surprising what follows, once they decide to take a look in the basement but it is surprising how James Wan has managed to take such a tired theme of haunting and possession and revive it so convincingly.I am no stranger to these kind of movies but this one truly tops them all for tension and terror. I really enjoyed Sinister recently, which I found to be equally as scary but it lost its way a bit towards the end, whereas The Conjuring keeps tempo and has a fairly satisfying conclusion. I particularly liked the way the film took a turn for the comical somewhere in the middle, only for perhaps five minutes, then came back firing on all cylinders as it headed to the finale. If this was intentional, to lure us into a false sense of security, it worked beautifully.If you're the type to poo-poo this genre in general, I can't see you suddenly being converted to a believer but, if you enjoy classic horror like The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist, I can almost guarantee The Conjuring won't disappoint.",9,341,461,30 June 2013
Straight Outta Compton," Gritty, inspiring and impressive
","This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. I missed it at the cinema, as I was doubtful it would be any good but having now seen it three times, I thought I'd add this review.I had bought the album of the same name some years ago but never knew the background story, which turns out to be very inspiring and thoroughly engaging.Rap legends Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Easy E formed NWA in the late 80s. This biopic tells the riveting story of the band and their stereotypically manipulative manager Jerry Heller and we see some appearances from other characters along the way, like Snoop Dog, Suge Knight and Jimmy Iovine. It focusses on the formation of the band, their music and the events which drove their creativity. Fans of the original album, like myself, will probably get bonus enjoyment from seeing some tracks performed during the movie.The gangster myth surrounding the band is put in the spotlight here. These kids were no saints but they weren't hardened gang members and had the sense and drive to take their lives in the right direction. There's little difference, aside from the music, between the likes of NWA and other controversial bands like Motley Crue, yet the establishment's prejudice saw them as thugs and criminals.It's nothing entirely new - other band stories follow a similar theme of inception, climb to fame, controversy and turmoil, band splits, etc. but Straight Outa Compton has fantastic performances from all the cast - especially Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti - and is gripping on three levels.The first is witnessing the birth of the joint genius of Dr Dre, Cube and Easy E and where it takes them as the story unfolds. The second is the rise of the band and the usual issues that arise from fame and money in the music industry. The third and most powerful is the band's battle against the authorities and, in particular, the FBI. There are no dull moments in this movie and, at nearly 150 minutes, is a solid achievement for the writers and director F Gary Gray.Don't expect the uplifting vibes of Bohemian Rhapsody. It's aptly gritty in places and the movie's tone is in keeping with the hard edge of the band's music.For me, it does justice to their story and is an impressive film.",8,0,4,28 March 2019
