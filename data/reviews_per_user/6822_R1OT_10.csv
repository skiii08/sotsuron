The Blair Witch Project," An emotional roller coaster ride
","From all of the hype in the media concerning 'The Blair Witch Project' (TBWP), I was hoping with all of my might that it just wasn't that ... hype.It was a small crowd (I saw a very early show), but from the second the film began, you could hear a pin drop in the theatre.  It's very uncommon nowadays to goto a movie and not hear anyone talking, murmuring, whispering. This was one of those times.TBWP scared me.  It was very easy to place myself in the woods with these kids, and to pretend I was one of their group.  My emotions went from slight laughter to concern to sorrow to anger to betrayal to fear over and over again.No movie has ever filled me with the suspense and the sheer fear of the dark like TBWP.  From beginning to end, I found myself not able to move, in fear I may miss something.When the film ended, everyone in the theatre just sat there; no one got up for at least 30 seconds.  Families and couples and friends all walked out not uttering a word to each other; it was like everyone was at a funeral and everyone's best friend was in the casket.I, myself, left the theatre in disbelief and somewhat mildly shocked.  If you can put yourself up there on the screen with the kids, you can actually feel their pain.  This film was WONDERFULLY done.I can honestly rate TBWP as one of the greatest horror/suspense films of the decade.  I will see it again; perhaps tonight. But I won't go to sleep in the woods.  You can count on that.Hype? I think not.  Go see it.  You'll be glad you did.Rating: 5 out of 5",10,1,2,30 July 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Wonderful
","When I give reviews on films or when I tell family or friends about films, I like to go into detail of why I liked each character, the writing, the actors' performance, etc...With 'Shakespeare in Love', I can't do that here.  Why?  Because I would ramble and go on typing forever.  This is, to put it simply, an outstanding film.  Sure, there are aspects of the historical time that didn't jive, but this film was meant to entertain, not to give us a history lesson.I have read the many works of Shakespeare, and in particular I have read and re-read and re-read Romeo and Juliet.  Still, in the closing minutes of 'Shakespeare in Love' I still found myself starting to shed a tear.  Norman and Stoppard paralleled the relationship between Shakespeare / Viola and Romeo / Juliet probably more than was really the case, and it was masterful. The performances of the leading couple were breathtaking. The ...  see? Here I go...I KNEW I shouldn't have gotten into it.  :o)The film is wonderfully done.  Although when the trailer was first aired and I wanted to see it very badly, the first time I actually saw it was on DVD. That is one disc that I'm extremely happy I bought.  I'm just sorry I waited so long.Bravo.RATING:  5 out of 5",10,5,9,23 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Matt and Trey have done it again
","I have to admit it, I'm a 29-year old man who LOVES those little bastards of South Park.  There.  I said it. :o)This film does and says what every person on the face of the planet wants to do and say every day of their lives, but are either afraid or shy to say or do it.  No one is safe from the antics of this film.  Every race, creed, religion, skin color, nationality....they all bite the dust in one way or another.Fun is poked at everyone.  The laughter meter goes well off the scale with this film.  I can't remember the last time when I sat in a theatre thinking to myself, 'Umm...they didn't just say that, did they?' or 'Did that really happen in front of my eyes?'.  This film goes to the limits and stampedes over them like a hoard of wild animals...not stopping until everything in its path has been squashed.  It's so unbelievable that in no way shape or form could this NOT be fun.Southpark: BL&U will certainly go down in film history as the movie that the world hated to love.  You just can't help it.Should you take your children? Absolutely not.  There is more profanity inch for inch than 'Scarface', and it gets to the point where what struck you as horrifying at the start seems like second nature at the end.If you want to be entertained, go see South Park.  The only thing you'll regret is that it took you so long to go.RATING:  5 out of 5",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Snatch," Wonderfully Written, Superbly Acted
","Ever since the first time I saw the trailer for 'Snatch', I was intrigued. It looked witty, fast, and very entertaining.  When I finally saw the film, that's exactly what I got; I was hit in the face with a 400lb gorilla of wildly entertaining fun right from the start.Brad Pitt's character, Micky, is extremely well written and very well played.  Dennis Farina hasn't been this good in years; it was like the part of Avi was written just for him.  This may sound a bit on the wild side, but the dog's scenes were some of the best in the film.  It's almost as if he had a humans brain, and could take acting cues right along with the rest of the cast.Richie has managed to balance the entire cast nearly perfectly; no one character dominates the screen.  This is evident even in the plot(or should I say plots).  Many times when a film tries to balance two plots, there's always one that stands out in your mind.  This isn't the case with 'Snatch'. The main plot and sub-plot mesh together perfectly, without one overpowering the other.It's not the greatest film to ever grace the big screen, but with the superb writing, the monstrous acting, and the fast-paced flow, 'Snatch' will be one of the year's big hits.   I loved it. :)9/10-Khabal",10,1,2,19 January 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Mixed Feelings ...
","I will attempt to differentiate my feelings about this film.  Technically and theatrically, this film is a masterpiece.  The visual effects and realistic atmosphere that are brought to the screen are breathtaking (in one way or another), and are unparallel by any other.  Each performance made you feel like you were that character's friend or family member, and made you feel emotion for them.  'Saving Private Ryan' is a prime example of what movie making should be ... technically.Emotionally and personally, I have to admit that I can never watch this film again.  The emotions of grief, fear, sadness, horror and despair that I felt from watching it made me literally sick.  Although it was a masterpiece in the way the story was told, the story itself was disgusting.  Being a Veteran of two MUCH less violent wars, I could only sit there and think of how I would have felt if I were there.I went to sleep that evening, after watching 'Ryan'; it was the most difficult night I have had in a while.  I believe that this film should have carried an NC-17 rating, because if I was Spielberg, I'm not sure if I could live with a 16 year old kid (even WITH his parents) seeing the events that unfolded on that screen.All-in-all, 'Saving Private Ryan' is a theatrical masterpiece.  But if you're going to watch it, be prepared for having your heart ripped out.",Null,0,0,26 May 1999
Men in Black II," Short. Cheesy. Bad.
","*MAY contain spoilers*Summer is a great time.  It's the time when you anticipate some of the most exciting and action-packed movies of the year.  You wait for films to make you laugh, cry, and jump out of your seat with exhilaration.  You wait for that one gem to rise up among all of the garbage that plagues our theatres each year.Unfortunately, this 'aint it.Seeing as how the first 20 minutes of the film are setup and 'J' trying to get 'K' back into MIB, that takes away just under 1/4 of the movie.  The film clocks in at less than 90 minutes.  Way too short by today's standards.As in the first film, there was a lot of back-and-forth banter between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, but being as though it reminds you too much of the first film, it grows tiresome very quickly.  Will Smith gets a bunch of one-liners, which are amusing at times, but once again, become old fast.I would like to have seen Rip Torn in more scenes; he is more fun to watch on screen than Smith and Jones combined, but because of the extremely short length of the film, there wasn't any chance of that happening.We didn't see that many different or exciting aliens this time around.  The huge worm (Jeff) in the subway system was more of a main character than 'Z' was.  Sure, we saw a bunch of friendly aliens (in the Post Office and the check-in station, etc) but the lack of exciting aliens to confront the MIB was disappointing.There WERE a few funny parts; Will Smith is a naturally funny man when he's not trying too hard, and although this was probably his worst acting performance of his career, it didn't stand out because the rest of the acting was just as bad (if not worse).Overall, MIB2 was a huge disappointment.  They could have done so much more with it, but it seemed like they relied on the name 'MIB' to carry the film. It unfortunately did not.3/10",2,1,1,30 June 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Umm....
",Wow?Not too much more to say.One of the finest films in history.RATING: 5 out of 5,Null,0,1,1 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," A Waste of $4.50
","After seeing the previews of 'The Sixth Sense', I was itching to see it. The idea was great, the story seemed great.  However, after sitting through this film (along with 1000 other people in a sold-out theater), I realize that there was one thing missing - interest.  I wish I had $1 for every person that was falling asleep around me.  This film is the poster child for boring.  Once again, they lured me in with awesome previews, took my $$, and kicked me in the ass.  This film makes you feel like you have just been violated.I DO have to say that the ending was unexpected, and the five minutes that made up the ending was decent.  It doesn't, however, make up for a horrible film.  What was Bruce Willis thinking when he read this script?  I mean, Willis isn't the best actor in Hollywood, but he should have at least had the brains to let someone else suffer through this (well, I mean someone BESIDES the people who saw it ... we suffered the most).I feel that I need to mention Haley Osment.  This child can act.  His character could not have been played any better by anyone else.  His performance stood out and he should be recognized for being a glimmer of light in such a terrible film.I implore you .... take the $5 and either rent a good film from BBuster or better yet, flush it down the toilet...because that's where it will go ANYWAY if you spend it on 'The Sixth Sense'.  Wait until it hits video and borrow it from a friend when HE rents it.'Frightening'? 'A Thriller'? 'Edge-of-your-seat'?Not even close.If you are easily disappointed, stay away from this film.RATING:  1 out of 5",2,1,2,8 August 1999
The Matrix," Not all that it's cracked up to be
","If you've seen the commercial for 'The Matrix', then you've basically seen it all.  95% of the action in this film can be seen in the trailer. The feeble attempt to cover an extremely thin plot by dazzling the audience with special effects ALMOST works; there just wasn't enough surprise since they gave it all away in the commercials. If you're looking for well-rounded characters, you will be disappointed. They are as flat as the plot. Fishburne does a great job in his role, but the long-winded speeches and monotone expression will put you to sleep. The last 25 minutes or so gave 'The Matrix' a breath of fresh air; wonderful action. If you fell asleep from the first 90 minutes, you will be awake then.  Many people saw that last 25 minutes and thought the film was great because of just that. I, however, believe it takes much more than a few special effects to earn my $6.50. At least at the show I saw, I was one of the majority; it seemed like more people disliked it than enjoyed it. If you have $6.50 and 2 hrs to spare, and if the Cable is out, go see 'The Matrix' ... otherwise, wait for the video.",1,16,39,23 April 1999
The Thin Red Line," I couldn't even finish watching it
","Sometimes I can't understand what people are thinking.  It's hard to imagine what sort of people nominated this film for Best Picture of the Year. After 2 hours, I had to turn it off, rewind it, and instantly bring it back to the video store.  I went into this movie expecting way more than it delivered. I was expecting a war movie; what I got was half a war movie, and half a 'bring back all the memories of my life before the war' love story. Tossing a few big-name stars in the mix didn't help either.  Harrleson, Clooney, Travolta ... perhaps they thought these people would salvage the film.Nick Nolte was spectacular, however; his powerful performance was one aspect that made it slightly bareable.  Aside from Nolte, I found myself dozing off many times.In my opinion, 'The Thin Red Line' could have been so much better.  It IS a shame, however, that 99% of the people watching this movie were comparing it to 'Saving Private Ryan'.  This didn't help matters either.If you have $4.00 burning a hole in your pocket, rent it.  But make sure it's on a night when there's something good on TV, because you'll find yourself switching it off to see what the Baywatch Lifeguards are up to.Rating: 1.5 out of 5",Null,0,0,27 July 1999
