Deepwater Horizon," the true disaster here was the director
","This is a confusing and extremely poorly directed film.The acting was good, the players did their job but sound direction made subtitles a requirement. A short course in oil drill operation would be a desirable pre requisite. The basic ideas were put as subtitles for the rest of us in the bottom left of the screen as a substitute for actually telling a story.The actual disaster is just a wild confusion of bangs and booms which are of themselves not particularly entertaining or enlightening. The bad guys wear white hats (which at least is novel) and even their part in the story is obscure.In short another example of bang crash boom with special effects instead of a real movie with plot or story to tell.",3,4,8,6 April 2017
Rocketman," not a biopic more a montage
","Not what was expecting but a very enjoyable and entertaining film, more a collage or kaleidoscope of E J's life (probably from his perspective) with music as a linkage. So unusual but somehow, for me, it sort of works.",8,1,3,2 September 2019
A Star Is Born," ok but not great
","Very slow start, and very predictable throughout, but well acted and although character development was superficial still was entertaining and sad. Seen a lot worse and paid more so worth the watch overall. More a chic flick than a great movie but as I said still entertains.",6,0,1,5 May 2019
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," stultifying
","Incomprehensible, and slow. Unless you have read the book or seen another version it is very hard to follow and not worth the effort. As with many longer complex book the film versions cannot really be adapted very convincingly.",3,0,6,8 July 2019
The Godfather: Part II," long winded and does not deliver
",The original was good but this one just gets lost in convoluted flash backs and a too complex a plot with no real fullfilment. Also way too long. Dated now and I cannot understand the high scores reviewing it.,4,2,4,11 November 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Good effort
","While it is a little loose in some areas basically a good dramatisation with acceptable artistic licence and some of the seedy side acknowledged but not revellered in. Not a documentary but a good story based loosely on fact,",8,5,6,4 February 2019
The Thing," excellent!
",How a horor / scifi should be done. Modern directors should have to watch this except if they did most would give up - good thing too imho.,9,2,4,23 March 2019
Bridge of Spies," a really well founded film.
","Based on fact and well made, why can't we have more like this or of similar quality?",9,0,0,23 March 2019
Dunkirk," Unusual style
","Intelligently done in a very unusual (not commercial?) Style of story telling, once again if you are expecting a classic war movie or action film - well its not. But it is strangely watchable and engaging.",8,0,1,28 February 2019
Toy Story 4," A good finale
","Probably not popular to some, but I found this a well executed finale to the Toy Story series. The plot diverges from the previous stoy lines but wraps up the theme pretty well. It is not what you expect of the series however and if you want a remix repeat of the previous 3 stories you are probably going to be disappointed. Well done to the writers for having the courage to move the story on.",8,2,5,16 October 2019
The Favourite," Weird
","Absurd and strange, I found it unwatchable and stopped fairly soon after it started so reviewing it is unfair, except to say I could not be bothered to watch something that started so weirdly.",2,2,6,31 August 2019
Legend," Entertaining semi biopic
",Well acted and with a sense of drama added but another 'based on true story' film. As most will know means that many and in some cases all events are missed or fictional depending on the writers and directors whim.nevertheless an entertaining drama well filmed and acted.,7,1,1,24 November 2019
Ex Machina," good idea slowly executed
",Good idea and some good twists in plot but so slowly executed that it gets boring especially as most people would see where it was all going. What we wanted to know was 1 - why was the principle doing this in isolation and 2 - what happened after the escape?,5,1,3,28 September 2018
Snowden," long and predictable
","Please note this is about the movie, not the reality of Snowden.As a movie the acting is good and professional but the story is poorly told, disjointed and lacks continuity.There are multiple jumps forward and back in time, hints of what is happening in terms of scanning and hacking ordinary people but nothing is developed to make this important within the context of the movie. Ultimately it gets somewhat tedious and faintly boring.The whole movie just seems a build up to the glorification of the betrayal / whistleblowing profound ending speech. Not a good effort sadly.",Null,0,3,10 April 2017
American Made," ok if you like airplanes
",And its ok if you like conspiracy movies but it has as much fact in it as Walt Disney's Toy Story. The facts are covered in a couple of good books on the subject and Barry Seal was essentially a drug runner and nothing more. Here he is portrayed as a sort of Robin Hood character. Ok entertainment but to say it is based o fact is a large stretch,5,0,1,23 March 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," jane austin meets 1946 guernsey
","Well acted, well screened but long winded romantic epic which fails to entertain unless you are a jane austin or similar fan. Very predictable from first 20 minutes and not very inspiring, anyone interested should probably read the book as others have advised (I haven't and never will now).",3,1,2,18 November 2018
Arrival," nothing happens, pretentious and unfullfilling
","First the good,Great graphics, well filmed.And the bad,No real story, left wondering what is really going on, Guess what, not a lot.An hour of working out translations and then it morphs into the latter part of 2001 space odessey, in the sense that there is some mystical significance which is not explained of course.Great long meaningful looks and remembrance's by the lead figure , not explained and overall the pace is glacial.Don't bother in my opinion.",1,13,24,8 June 2017
Midway," OK but could have been much better
","Follows the actual events but you would have know the history 'cos otherwise it would be very hard to understand. Misses largely because it does not overview the events in a cohesive way, sometimes you just have to resort to titles and explanations otherwise you loose the audience. Sadly it was OK but could have been so much better.",7,1,2,25 May 2020
Life," Never underestimate the aliens
","Good scifi, similar in context to Carpenters The Thing. Moved along and was believable. Good Job.",8,0,0,1 June 2020
Green Book," Entertaining but predictable
","A sad reflection of the 1960 s US race situation but well acted and entertaining and a story that does draw you in. Based on a true story which, as so often, is more poinent than fiction.",7,0,0,18 August 2019
Annihilation," obscure and mystical and who cares
","Dreadful strange storyline if you can grace it with that name. Well photographed but one of those films that at the end you say huh or wtf or why (as in why did I watch it).
I don't know what it is with sf films these days they are either wild west action in space or weird obscure mystic ending (because thevwriter couldn't find a rational ending) rubbish.",2,2,3,2 July 2019
Sully," Dirty harry meets ntsb
","Not a very appealing movie, lacking finesse and fitness, not even particularly entertaining. Firstly -factually incorrect, ntsb does not do open hearings without first reviewing the evidence. Next the whole movie is focused on the theme that ntsb are out to 'get' the pilots,just not the case. No character development anywhere to be seen.No background development on the story or anyone in it. Just a pathetic attempt to stir up a story where there was non. Very disappointing movie from at least the director Clint Eastwood, who can make a geat movie when he wants too, just not this time.",3,5,9,23 December 2016
