Raiders of the Lost Ark," Action/Adventure films don't get any better than this!
","'Raiders' is the best on-screen thrill ride every made. It hits the ground running and never stops with some of the best and most memorable action sequences ever filmed. Just buckle in for the ride as you watch Harrison Ford defy death and battle the evil Nazis as the legendary Indiana Jones trying to save the Ark                           of the Covenant from their clutches. A perfect blend of adventure, humor and pure excitement that will have you leaving the theater with an adrenalin high. The very last sequence of this movie is quietly staggering, bordering on the sublime.",Null,1,1,3 October 1998
Beauty and the Beast," Magnificent and Unsurpassed
","The best animated feature ever made.  Period.  No argument.  The Disney studios pulled out all the stops to create this sublime achievement, using the best animators, storytellers and musical artists in the business. Surpassing any animated feature made before or since this is simple story about a beautiful girl in a small village who wants to escape her 'provincial life' and the clutches of the handsome town brute who wants to have her for his own.  Told in the style of a lively Hollywood musical, this story is never boring and continuously engaging.  You won't find a better family film.  Even the movie's beginning, telling the background of the Beast through the use of stain glass windows, is stunningly beautiful and original. The musical numbers are alternately fun, hilarious, quietly sweet and rousing.Don't expect the DVD version of this film to last on the shelves very long.",Null,1,1,30 September 2000
Alien," A terrifying game of cat and mouse in outer space
","A simple horror story in space that sent screams though the audiences when in was introduced in the 70's and continues to shock and terrify to this day.  A fantastic acting achievement by all the players as a crew who must contend with an alien that is accidentally brought on board their space ship.  This heart-pounding masterpiece will have you trying to hide your body in your chair as the crew members first try to hunt down and then try to escape from the most terrifying creature ever conceived for the cinema. The outstanding production design, lighting effects and score only  add to the suspense and horror.  See it in the dark alone if you want to experience raw fear.",Null,0,1,17 October 1998
Glory," Underrated and Magnificent
",The fact that this great film was not even nominated for an academy award for best picture shows how out-to-lunch the academy members were in 1989. This film not only should have won over 'Driving Miss Daisy' that year but would be highly competitive in any year.  Matthew Broderick shines as the Colonel  who commands a rag-tag group of black enlisted men during the Civil War.  He and the men he fights with show what true honor and bravery are all about during wartime.  Every character is compelling and you feel right along with them as the plot unfolds.  A must see.,9,0,0,17 October 1998
The Princess Bride," A joyous tale
","The simplest pleasures in life are the best, and this film is one of them. Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movie transcends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm.  Every character is a delight and you just want to see more of them.  'The Princess Bride' is based on the unsurpassed novel by William Goldman, who also penned the screenplay. While this is a movie review, I cannot recommend the book on which it is based more highly.  It is quite simply the most humorous, enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that were impossible to include on the screen.  The only other movie of this type that I can think of that is this much fun was Danny Kaye's 'The Court Jester,' another costumed comedy/adventure/romance that I also highly recommend.",9,42,54,17 October 1998
Schindler's List," Staggering and Sublime
","Not only is this masterpiece the greatest  film ever made, it can be considered one of mankind's greatest artistic achievements, to be compared with the best of Mozart, Shakespeare and Michelangelo.  Using the subtle but startling shadings only black and white cinema can produce Steven Speilberg has created a protean achievement both thought-provoking and shattering in content and scope.  Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the concentration camp commandant  shows the horrifying side of a human both sad and twisted.  Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally compelling.  John Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional response without overcoming this disturbing story about a German industrialist who slowly learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the few Jews  he can from certain death. This miraculous piece of cinema should be required viewing for anyone interested in the human condition and the depths and height  to which we all can reach.",10,10,17,14 September 1998
Pulp Fiction," Unentertaining trash
","One of the few movies I have ever seen that made me feel soiled and pistol whipped.  Although the non-linear story line is indeed an interesting concept Tarantino becomes so absorbed in showing us society's underbelly he leaves us with a hopeless mess of a film.  The violence is a study in wretched excess, involving careless murders, drug use, kidnapping and rape. There isn't even a single character worth understanding or identifying with. I ended up hoping everyone, including Tarantino, would die at the end of this film.  Unfulfilling garbage.",3,8,18,11 October 1998
