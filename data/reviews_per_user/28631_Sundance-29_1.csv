The Blair Witch Project," Probably not the BEST horror flick, but definitely a DAMN GOOD ONE!!!!
","Okay, here goes...you've read all the reviews below and above this one, so I'm not going to retread the story... Let me just start by saying that anyone who is NOT at least freaked out by the ending sequence is incapable of emotion...if you don't pay attention to the way the Legend is told in the beginning, you won't understand the ending until someone explains it to you and you're like-'Oh, THAT'S why he was -' never mind...don't wanna spoil it! I, for one, checked every nook and cranny of my home before going to bed that night. Kudos to the filmakers-this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is HORROR. I mean, w/out the use of any special effects (I DID love The Matrix's dazzling display, though!!!), soundtrack, extra mics or ANYTHING (by the way--the production value was SUPPOSED to be shoddy and low-budget! It was a 'student project'!!! Stop complaining or get stronger stomachs, Wussies!!!), these guys were able to pull off one of the BEST horror flicks EVER...not THE best, just one of the better ones! We all know that the three hikers are actors, and that the footage is not real...or do we? These guys give such a stark sense of realism and utter dread with their performances that you feel like you're w/these poor kids in the haunted woods. This is an EXTREMELY SCARY, DISTURBING MOVIE, like Faces of Death w/o the blood and guts, but even more freaky because of what's just past the edge of your vision in the dark-what the hell WAS that in the shadows, anyway? It does start off a little slow @ 1st, but it quickly picks up pace. We need more fright fests like this one in American Cinema-maybe the horror genre isn't lost after all...The ending!!! WOW!!!",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
