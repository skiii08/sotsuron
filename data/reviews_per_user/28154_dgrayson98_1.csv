First Man," Why Make This Movie?
","Such a terrible interpretation of one of mankind's greatest triumphs.Soundtrack simply pathetic.Boring as hell. A travesty.Same director as Whiplash, a movie I used to love but now like mush less. Everything Damien Chazelle touches is tainted now.You'll want this two and a half hours of your life back.",2,1,3,18 January 2019
