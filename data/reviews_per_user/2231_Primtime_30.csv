The Blair Witch Project," Highly Overrated
","With The Blair Witch Project, I have read and heard many an overrated reviews. This film simply isn't all that amazing. Rather than what others say about being shocked at the last ten minutes of the film or being scared throughout, it just doesn't ring true. What really got me was the fact so many people still sat in their chairs after the film was over. Someone was even crying. I haven't seen that kind of reaction to a film since 'Saving Private Ryan.' Even Eyes Wide Shut, which is a much better film had no one staying afterwards.One can talk of the raw emotion that this film conveys to the viewer. I have a problem with this though. Not enough of the film is seen on camera. During the late night scenes in which someone or something is moving around the tent, we never get to see the looks on the faces of the actors. A lot of emotion is heard, especially during the last quarter of the film, but since I couldn't see it happening, it all seemed rather phony to me.The fact that this film will in time become the most profitable of all time just goes to how much impact hype really has. There hasn't been a person who I talked to about this film that doesn't want to see it. The truth of it all is that I have seen much better films this summer including EWS and American Pie and would recommend these over BWP any time. This film is definitely a rental.5/10 stars.",5,0,2,12 August 1999
Vertigo," Classic Hitch Thriller
","Vertigo is a special kind of film. This is because it doesn't follow the usual way a film is presented to the viewer. Rather than having the main suspense near the end of the film, Vertigo has this high level of suspense at both the end and middle of the film. Few could have pulled this off quite as well as Hitch.I really liked this film in the stylish way it was presented. Time is not overly spent getting into the characters here, they are simply presented for who they are leaving the judgement up to the viewer. The 'Vertigo' special effect and the nightmare sequence were done like nothing I have ever seen for a film of this time and are enchanting and timeless. The plot and storyline of this film are both original and not cliched. The audience is taken by surprise during the middle of the film and from there on the film becomes even more suspenseful.Jimmy Stewart put another of his great performances into this film and played well opposite Kim Novak's dark and confused character. Stewart shows the full range of emotions as he is taken by the alluring Madeline (Novak) and is driven to a deep depression. Novak had been criticized for playing her role too darkly which is a claim I find completely unfounded. For a woman who is going through so much stress (or at least we are to believe that), she plays as well as this role could have been done. The interesting thing about the performances in this film is how much time Stewart and Novak are on the screen. For 95% of the film, there is not another character to add anything else to the plot. Other than Barbara Bel Geddes, who gives a short, supporting performance, the film revolves around the realtionship between Ferguson (Stewart) and Madeline.I must say that I enjoyed this film just as much as Rear Window and would even put this one above North by Northwest. Hitchcock does suspense so well and is quite obvious to see why he is imitated so much. A recommendation to all.8/10 stars.",8,13,20,6 February 1999
The Sound of Music," A Great Film
","Before watching this film for the first time ( I have seen the play ) I expected it to be quite corny as most musicals of this time period are. Yes, there is a lot of kitsch intertwined in this film, however, taking very little out of the final product. This film is quite brilliant and the THX edition looks and sounds as if it were made during this decade.I loved the performances of Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews. Both give performances as they were meant to be and give the film the perfect flow. Plummer is one of my favourite actors and watching this film will give you a good idea of how talented he is. The best aspect of this film is the beautiful way it was shot. Robert Wise did a brilliant job giving this film even more character, making it more than just another musical. The opening sequence of the camera coming through the clouds into the wonderous mountains is just a taste of what is to come later in the film. The way the subtle whites and blues are used to give the film a special glow is something that has rarely ever been emulated.I give a full recommendation of this film and put it in the must-see category.8/10 stars.",8,2,9,12 August 1999
Casablanca," One of the all-time best
","After a long time waiting, I finally sat down and made the time to watch Casablanca. Always hearing about the greatness of this film I knew that it had to be good, however, I still had my doubts. After all, Bogey playing a suave, yet hard-nosed romantic? After watching this film, all of my doubts were erased and I realized that this was one of the top films of all time.I find the fact that Casablanca was just another film (one of 50 films made by Warner Studios each year) amazing. The fact that the script of this film was made as the film was shot is also amazing considering that this is one of the greatest scripts ever written. For a romantic picture of the '40's this movie moves incredibly well. The war sub-plot of the film to me is what really kept the film moving at such a pace. Even though the film takes place over one day, the feeling of the war going on at the same time increases the sense of speed in the film. The war makes the flashback scene which also really completes the film. Perhaps some of the greatest film moments of all time occur in these short three minutes which contain more than most films do in two hours. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman has such a presence in this film that makes the ending such a tragedy followed by such a redemption. Few films have neared the closeness of the two actors in this film. Throw in Paul Henried and his charming performance and you have a deadly love triangle that has been rarely surpassed. The song and score of this film are two more elements that make it so enchanting. The way that 'As time goes by' is heard throughout the film gives it that haunting, yet subtle undertone that makes this movie so great. I feel that more than anything else, it was the music of this film that held everything together.Casablanca's cast of such variable characters has also been rarely if ever matched by another film. Three performances struck me in this film as being more than supporting characters, even though they were only supporting characters. Claude Rains as the Chief Renaud now ranks as one of my all-time favourites, Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari has a short but poignant role, powerful enough to match up with Bogey and Dooley Wilson as Rick's best friend Sam plays another subtle, but powerful role. It is the personality mix of the characters that makes the film so overwhelming and interestingly enough, there is no true antagonist (Strasses comes close, yet still doesn't truly fulfill the role of the antagonist). The theme of lost love in this film is what made it so special for myself and many others.  However, the ending leaves the viewer with the feeling that what had happened was the right way to end the relationship, because after all 'they had Paris.'The values, themes and ideas of this film will always hold true for me and I am glad that after all I was able to see this great piece of filmmaking.9/10 stars.",9,0,0,14 November 1998
The Big Lebowski," Coens come through again
","The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time. How the Coens manage to put every sort of character, plot twists, unordered sequences and musical interludes into a film and still make it work is magical to me.Jeff Bridges plays 'the Dude' perfectly in this film opposite John Goodman as his buddy Walter. The duo are absolutely hilarious together and seem to play flawlessly off of each other throughout the film. Steve Buscemi plays a short but funny role as the spaced out friend of the Dude and John Turturro may have well stole the show playing the over-indulgent exposer/bowler Jesus.This film contains some of the most hilarious and wacky scenes that I have seen in a long time. These include: the scene in which thugs bust into the Dude's lair and dunk his head in his toilet and then proceed to urinate all over his rug, the scene in which the Dude writes a check for 69 cents, the scene in which the Germans bust into the Dude's lair and put a Marmot into the tub with him while he is having a bath and the fight scene between the Germans and the Dude, Walter and Buscemi's character.This film worked for me in every aspect except for the lack of a plot to guide the film and the overlong ending. Regardless of these points, The Big Lebowski is about as much entertainment as one should be able to watch in two hours.7/10 stars.",7,0,2,4 January 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Excellent script and tremendous imagery
","Shakespeare In Love is a great film that is fully deserving of its 13 Oscar nominations. Everything about this film seems to click, working together like fine clockwork in order to hit perfection. I believe that if it wasn't for Mr. Spielberg and his scathing view of the battles of Normandy, this film would already have won Best Picture; no questions asked.I had high expectations before going to see this film and later found myself not wanting to leave as the ending credits rolled across the screen, it was simply that good. Tom Stoppard wrote one of the most literary enchanted screenplays that I have ever heard, if you didn't watch this film rather only listened to it, the whole effect would still be there. The beautifully crafted love story, the constant inside jokes about Shakespeare and how he got some of his ideas, the effortless dialogue between supporting characters that added so much to the film and the interesting ideas presented (Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter) make for a sure winner of Best Original Screenplay.John Madden must also be commended for his work here regardless of the fact he really had quite a lot to work with. The film flows at an excellent pace throughout and at times has the quickness to tie in any scenes that may be lacking the full throttle. The presentation of the sets, characters and emotions are very clear and striking. The whole scene in which Romeo and Juliet was finally played was one of the greatest ever put together and had me sitting on the edge of my seat, without using any explosions or other devices that are so common in films today.Gwyneth Palthow gives what I believe is her best performance to date and is surely Oscar material. She seems to radiate at all times on the screen, even when she is dressed as a boy. Her accent flows naturally and she manages to pull off tremendous beauty while still can be regarded as just another member of the play. Joseph Fiennes plays a young William Shakespeare as troubled at times like when he has writer's block and full of panache at times like when he finally finishes the play and all the while he falls in love with the mystical Viola (Gwyneth Palthow).All supporting characters fully hit the mark, especially Geoffrey Rush as the bumbling Philip Henstowe. Perhaps he is at his best right at the beginning of the film when he is about to get his feet burnt off. Dame Judi Dench also gives a short yet strong performance as Queen Elizabeth. Regardless of what others may say about her lack of lines in the film, she still fully deserves a nomination for a supporting role since few others could have pulled it off quite like her. I love the scene in which she tells Viola's soon to be husband, Lord Essex about how she knows Viola has already been... well s*****d if you will. This is pure cinematic gold.I really loved this film, although it still ranks below Saving Private Ryan as my best of 1998. Even though I believe that Ryan will win for Best Picture, I wouldn't be at all surprised if Shakespeare snuck in and stole it from right underneath Spielberg.9/10 stars.",9,0,0,10 March 1999
Blade," The usual action film
","Blade introduces few new ideas as far as an action film goes. This film produces a lot of blood and violence, the usual predictable ending and a very thin plot. Some have compared this film to Spawn which is much worse and could even make this film look good.Wesley Snipes plays this role with little emotion, a cold killer with the advantages of being half-vampire, half-human and none of the disadvantages that go with either. I never really cared for Blade or his mentour and couldn't really get behind any of the vampires either. Without anyone to endorse, this film is nothing more than a 120 minute special-effects-filled trailer.I must note that a sequel is being made to tie up the loose ends left by this film. However, after watching this film, I can't see why anyone would even care about a sequal. Even fans of the comic book must be disappointed by this effort.I would recommend this film as a rental for an evening when there is really nothing to do. Don't make a point of renting this film if you are looking for a story, because there simply isn't one here.5/10 stars.",5,1,2,11 August 1999
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Gets better every time
","I recently wathched this movie for the third time and found it to be a better movie than the last time I saw it. This is unique because I usually am not able to sit through a movie I have already wathced. I believe that Redford and Newman each gave career performances which were infinitely helped by an excellent performance from Katherine Ross.This movie does move at a slow pace at times, but has its fine points as well. The New York vignette has always been a movie magic piece in my mind and really helped to move the movie along from the overdone chase scene to the trip to Bolivia. The scene in which Butch confronts Logan for group leadership is also a personal favourite of mine. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the final shoot-out in which Butch and Sundance discuss ways to get away and what to do after even though they know they are going to go out in a blaze of glory.This movie could almost be considered a comedy rather than a western because of its melodramatic script and the fact that the viewer never gets to meet 'Those Guys'. This one will always be on my top 10 list.8/10 stars.",8,0,3,2 November 1998
Taxi Driver," Isolation on film
","WARNING!!! POINTS OF PLOT ARE GIVEN AWAY!!!!!If there was a more poignant moment in film history than the panning of the dead bodies and the guns that have just caused their deaths, I don't believe I've seen it yet. The scene speaks enough for a film itself and is the perfect way to end the film. Simply amazing.Taxi Driver is a great film that shows the kind of reaction one might develop to increased isolation from society. A lot of time in this film is spent on showing Travis (DeNiro) in his apartment quite literally losing his mind. After what must have been many terrifying incidents for the Vietnam vet, the return home has brought no relief, rather more new problems instead. The problem now  are all of the drug dealers, pimps, hookers, polititians and just about anyone else that he doesn't know. He looks at the streets of the city and only sees evil and decay. Travis sees degeneration all of the time, and decides that he must take action ( a line in the film goes something to the effect of 'I know what I am supposed to do, this is my calling' ). From here on everything changes and the audience is enveloped in the whirlwind of events to come.The film itself is one of the best shot, not as much for the murky underkeys of the New York streets, but rather for the effective use of new camera techniques. Near the beginning of the film, the camera pans over different parts of the taxi, never showing it as a whole. This could be a metaphor of the trouble going on inside of Travis (rendering him an incomplete person) or simply to show the troubles of society as a whole. The hall shot while Travis is on the phone with Beth (Shepherd) is reminiscent of Kubrick, while the overhead shot after the graphic ending sums up the film quite nicely. Scorsese even puts a decent performance as an irate husband who seeks vengeance for his wife's misdeeds (another good example of the filth of society).I don't understand why Scorsese added the end scene, giving nothing while not taking away anything either. The meetings with the fellow cabbies could have also been taken out of the film completely. It would have added an even further sense of isolation to Travis. More screen time should have been given to the Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel characters who were both much more interesting than the cabbies or Cybill Shepherd. This film runs a good length and has few dry moments. I prefer Raging Bull to Taxi Driver because of Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty who each give the main character more reason to rage out, rather than the indirect effects of society. I would also like to note that many people have felt that the violence in this film is Scorsese's darkest. I would have to disagree saying that both Goodfellas and Casino are far worse.Full recommendation.8/10 stars.",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
Forrest Gump," Definitely Oscar-Worthy
","Forrest Gump is pure magic to watch. How anyone could say that this film is lacking in any way or that the hidden messages within render it to the garbage heap baffles me. Just the way that the film moves alone makes it great, you can toss out the story, performances and direction and Forrest Gump would still be miles ahead of the rest.Tom Hanks gives a great performance in the title role (although Morgan Freeman was probably more deserving in the Shawshank Redemption). Hanks portrays the man with an I.Q. of 75 like few actors could and maintains this throughout the film. Just the way that Forrest stumbles through all of the great U.S. events from the 50's to the 80's and thinks nothing of it is an accomplishment in itself.Zemekis did well making this film, just like the Back To The Future series. This film surely did not lack vision and all concepts are fresh and real for the time. Who would have ever thought that they could be placed in an interview with John Lennon? Well now thanks to Industrial Light and Magic, anyone can. Regardless what others may say about a weak or nonexistent ending, did the other 1994 favourite have one? Not really. This film is tied up about as well as possible with yet another coincedence.I haven't a bad thing to say about this film and fully recommend to all.9/10 stars.",9,1,4,14 June 1999
Fargo," Great story; done as only the Coen's could
","I recently watched Fargo for the second time, having watched this film about two years ago. It seemed to me that I liked this film much more the first time. Fargo has the interesting storyline, great direction and superb acting, yet I felt that something was missing. A hA! Could it be a little bit more realism and perhaps a bit longer film.Regardless of the fact that Frances McDormand played the part very well and even won Best Actress for it, she seemed to play her character too dumb-wittedly. Margie (McDormand's character) seems to be a couple nickels short of a dime and yet manages to solve this murder mystery (albeit a really bungled up one) in what seems like record time. No sooner has she arrived on the scene, than she already knows what happened, when it happened, who was responsible and where to go from there. I've been to Minnesota and North Dakota and the people that live there are not at all like the morons that they are portrayed as in this film.The length of the movie seemed too short. If Marge had at least pursued the killers for some time, rather than stumbling upon their hideout (also too unbelievable) almost instantly, this film could have been much better. I don't like the way the Coen's wrapped up this film like they were in a hurry and needed to go somewhere.Other than these problems I really liked the film and never lost attention from it. The story is quite original and leaves you wondering just what is going to happen next. The performances are top notch, especially Steve Buscemi who is humourously always referred to as a 'funny-looking-guy in some sort of general way.' This film doesn't top Raising Arizona as far as I'm concerned but is still more than worthy of a rental.8/10 stars.",8,0,1,26 March 1999
American Pie," Pushes The Sexual Entendre Envelope
","American Pie could be simply described as the 'There's Something About Mary' of 1999. It uses many of the same jokes about certain bodily fluids, flatulation, zit-faced losers and getting it on with an older woman. Needless to say, this film fully deserves its R rating as it goes full out in trying to get laughs and in its high sexual content.This film is funny, extremely funny at times, regardless of how it is done. By following the adventures of four graduating virgins, all trying to get laid, most films would not have problems getting the laughs. The final scenes of the film wrap it up nicely with some predictable and unpredictable happenings (Let's just say that I didn't expect to hear Mrs. Robinson in this film). Beyond the masturbation, pastry-loving and nude magazine scenes, one almost feels that the filmmakers are trying to end it all up with a Disney 'be good' message, however, that is all taken away (Thankfully).The acting in this film is sub-par, but really does nothing to diminish the story. I also didn't care for the Oz - innocent choir girl relationship. How a hardcore, lacrosse playing jock could turn so soft so quickly is something only the movies could do. It also seemed that the gossipy redhead character was totally unnecessary as she added nothing to the film. The script was well written and the director created exactly what goes on for teenage boys at this time in their life. These facts combined with the abundance of comedy help to give this film such a good mark. Can't wait for the college sequel.Be prepared to be grossed out and laugh, because after all this is only a popcorn movie.6/10 stars.",6,0,0,10 July 1999
He Got Game," Lee's best since Malcolm X
","He Got Game is without a doubt one of the best films of 1998. Spike Lee's story and direction are very near flawless and the use of a symphonic score to go with a few songs by Public Enemy make the visuals all the more appealing.If Spike Lee has the vision to make this film what it is, then Denzel Washington must be credited for making it believable. His performance is flawless as a imperfect man who has a chance to redeem himself by convincing his alienated son to play for a certain college basketball team. The story of redemption between the father and son is at times lacking, but still holds true. The scope of emotion isn't always shown by Ray Allen who plays Jesus Shuttlesworth, an amazing basketball prodigy who will one day by the next Jordan of the NBA. He shows more emotion when arguing with his girlfriend rather than in the scenes when it is really needed, like when his father returns. Allen though isn't an actor, he is a real NBA basketball player and must be credited for his performance. Rosario Dawson must also be credited for a great performance as Lala, Jesus' girlfriend. She steals all of her scenes, even those with Washington, as the girlfriend who realizes that once Jesus leaves, she will be left with nothing.Aaron Copland's score (chosen by Lee?) also plays a huge role. The beginning basketball montage is amazing, showing the diversity of those who play and love the game. Rather than using an all-rap  soundtrack like most other basketball films, the symphonic sounds make the film a lot less aggressive and a lot more heartwarming. Not to take anything away from Public Enemy's He Got Game which is used well at the end of the film.Some have said that the sexual content in this film is too much and unnecessary. I have to disagree, since it is used to show the realism of college basketball. Those who think it is all books and study and a weekly game are right off the mark. It is a lot more drugs, sex and cars than most would realize. If anything is overplayed, it is the fact that the main characters name is Jesus. So much of the film is unnecessarily spent on determining why his name his Jesus, the pain he feels because of how he was always being bugged about his name and the whole deal about his new basketball stardom being called 'the second coming of Jesus'. This was too much to take and was distracting from what Lee was really trying to say.
A full recommendation for this film, even worth a DVD purchase.8/10 stars.",8,0,2,3 September 1999
American History X," One of the best of 1998
","American History X is a startling film that never lacks focus in its portrayal of a white racist; both in his learning and departure of the extremest beliefs. Kaye's debut is something he should be proud of, rather than trying to distance himself from the project. Each and every shot is well taken and the story, although constantly changing from past to present, flows like few other films do. Dealing with such a subject matter with force and staying neutral is an accomplishment in itself.Edward Norton's performance definitely merited the Oscar nod. Scenes in which he shows rage and anger towards Blacks, Jews or even members of his own family are what make this film what it is. Very few actors could have pulled this role off (think of Ben Affleck in this role instead and you will follow). Norton also shows the other side of his acting ability frequently in the film and is especially potent towards the end. This role moves Norton into the upper echelon of actors that can carry a film on their own. Without Norton, there is no American History X.The supporting cast all play their role to par. Edward Furlong does well in the role of the younger brother, although he is no Norton. Stacy Keach plays the leader of the skinheads very well and should have had a greater presence in the film. Beverly D'Angelo, John Avery and Elliot Gould round up the cast, all giving their usual smart performances. The only problem I has with this film was the manner in which Norton's character is such an extreme racist and is changed so quickly. Without giving away the reason, and a good one it may be, I felt that the sudden change took away credibility from the story. Perhaps this was one of the points that Norton and Kaye disagreed on.Regardless of any squabbles that may have occured between Kaye and Norton, this film is still one of the best of 1998. I would surely like to find out what the disagreement was about and whether it was personal or film-based.

Lawrence of Arabia," Cinematography and acting at its best.
","Lawrence of Arabia is simply the best shot film of all time. David Lean's portrayal of the British officer is magnificently done on 70mm film. One can imagine just how long it would have to take to get a proper shot while using such bulky equipment in the desert. Regardless, this is Lean's masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time.Performances from Peter O'Toole, Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif and especially Anthony Quinn are flawless and do a great deal in making this four hour film not seem like a four hour film.I would recommend this film to all, because seeing a film of this magnitude makes one appreciate what good films are all about.9/10 stars.",9,0,2,2 April 1999
Schindler's List," A great piece of moviemaking
","I definitely had very high expectations before I watched this film. After all, I was one of the few people that I knew that hadn't seen Schindler's List. Recently, high expectations have been my downfall coming into a film because I expect too much and that is clearly the case here.Sure, this film is very highly regarded and may even go down as the best film of the 90's, however, it didn't blow me away as I expected or show me an aspect of filmmaking that I have never seen before. Spielberg does an incredible job as usual using his keen sense of angles and dimensions that make every scene speak volumes. The cinematography by Janucz Kaminsky captures a lot of the feeling of the second world war, yet it didn't blow me away.I found it interesting that in this film the characters seem to take a secondary role to the setting, history and true story of the Holocaust. Liam Neeson played Schindler well, but did not affect me like other characters in great films. Even Ralph Fienns character was played well but also failed to register as a memorable one.Don't get me wrong, I really liked this film and the message it sends. I don't think this is the best film of the 90's, however, realize that it is still one of the best.9/10 stars.",9,9,13,4 March 1999
Pi," Interesting idea; not enough substance
","Aronofsky's debut shows the kind of potential he has as a director. Seeing what he did on a shoestring budget is a reminder of what Spielberg did with his debut in 'Duel'. Pi seems to have a very interesting plot as the film starts, however, sets off in the wrong direction thereafter.The story surrounds the discovery of a man named Max, a genius mathematician who spends what seems like all of his time on his computer looking for a pattern in numbers that none of his predecessors could find. Eventually Max comes upon these numbers in what seems to be a fluke situation and from here on in, he begins his downfall. Max is the victim of violent headaches as a result of staring at the son when he was six-years-old. The fact that this was thrown into the plot seems unnecessary and really has no effect on the film. I believe that Aronofsky should have just left these violent headaches to his unending desire to figure out the patterns.Up to this point, the film goes well until unnecessary third parties are thrown into the equation. The choice of stock brokers and ultra-orthodox jews aren't most people's idea of the bad guys in film (try substituting these groups for villains found in any action film and you'll see what I mean). One scene involving Max being dragged into the car by the Moses-like beards that comprised the religious group is funnier that most Saturday Night Live skits even though it isn't meant to be.Aronovsky chooses to use these new catalysts to drive Max crazy quicker. Sticking to his obsession with numbers would have been more effective and probably a lot more interesting since these groups are not at all menacing.The use of grainy black-and-white film was a nice touch here. It really helps to show that there is no cohesiveness in Max's life and how unimportant he would be if someone else got there hands on the number. The ending is also very satisfactory, tying up the film the best way possible. Sean Gullette's performance as Max is also very believable and quite gripping. Without Gullette, this film would be nothing as his emotions are what really keep it going.Can't wait to see what Aronofsky has in store. 7/10 stars.",Null,2,2,1 September 1999
The Graduate," Too High on the AFI
","To have this film ranked #7 on the AFI's 100 best list is an injustice to the majority of the films that followed. This is a good film, however, not top ten material.I'm not really sure why so many people have said that Dustin Hoffman gave an incredible performance in this film. Sure he showed emotions of confusion (although very naive for a college graduate) but how hard is it to make somebody think that you are confused? I believe that Anne Bancroft gave the only credible performance to this film. Whatever Mrs. Robinson's motives were for getting Benjamin into bed will always remain a mystery to me, and you can tell that Mrs. Robinson even has her doubts as well. Katherine Ross had the only other role of substance as the daughter of the Mrs. Robinson, and seems just as confused as Benjamin does throughout the film. Other than a few scenes of emotion, Ross adds very little to the film.The ending of this film has its great points - the whole exiting the church and taking off on a bus part, and its lackluster points - would you go off with a guy who slept numerous times with your mother on your wedding day? The music by Simon and Garfunkel played well throughout the film, although 'Scarborough Fair' just might have been played to death. Nichols did a very good job directing this film, especially the scene in which Benjamin is to meet all of his parents friends after coming home from college. Look for Richard Dreyfuss as the dorm student who says that he will call the cops.8/10 stars.",8,1,2,9 April 1999
Rocky," Gritty, reality-based movie
","I found Rocky to be a pretty good movie. I recently watched this movie for the third time and realized two things. 1) first, this movie wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. 2) secondly, this movie is a whole lot better than any other in the Rocky series.The acting in this movie is adequate since this movie moves at a pretty slow pace. Stallone's performance was good, but not Oscar-worthy. All of the other characters play secondary roles in the film and don't really make a huge impact maybe with the exception of Mickey (Burgess Meredith). Perhaps if we had seen more interaction between Mickey and Rocky instead of a lot of wasted time following Rocky around Philadelphia, the movie would have been that much better.I found the final fight scene in this film to be somewhat fake, because all of the boxing is pure offence. Rocky takes a turn beating on Creed and vise versa. Creed also seems unscathed after the 15 round match whereas Rocky doesn't look like the same Rocky that entered the ring. The film ends rather abruptly which I think was a very smart move. There was really no need to get into the after-fight details because they simply would have added very little to the story (also making room for a sequel(s)).7/10 stars.",Null,0,0,5 November 1998
Psycho," Hitch's best
","Psycho is more than just one of the best films of all-time. It is the inspiration behind a great number of films since and will forever be THE ultimate in both plot twists and suspense. Who would have ever imagined killing off both the main character and what seemed like an interesting story only a third into the film? Well, Hitch did and even told the moviegoers at the time to show up for the beginning of the film or else miss the wonderful Janet Leigh.Psycho has it all. A great story, well two as a matter of fact. One of the greatest scores by Bernard Herrmann (how many people don't know the skreetching violin and deep tuba sounds that really make the shower scene a classic?). The acting is superb with the chilling, almost-too-real portrayal of Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins and the running scared, almost-too-clued-out portrayal of Marion Crane by Janet Leigh. The supporting cast complete the film like few other casts do. Vera Miles makes the role of Crane's sister, honestly real and more than just a plot device.This film succeeds in all aspects, including the ending which is often said to be overlong and unecessary. Without hearing the inner thoughts of Bates, however, would leave a gaping hole in the production. The double image of Bates face with his mother's scull remains chilling, even in today's glorified, Natural Born Killers-like ultraviolence. Hitch's direction and shot techniques are as innovative as those seen in some of his earlier films like Vertigo and North-by-Northwest. Next time you watch Psycho, slow down the shower scene just to see how many separate shots Hitch put together to make it so great. Quite calculated.It's a shame that a film like Psycho had to have been marred by a few sequels and a terribly awful shot-by-shot remake. Unlike a continuing storyline like that of 'The Godfather', this story should have ended here.Full recommendation.9/10 stars.",9,5,9,29 August 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," One of the few films that is as good as the book
","To Kill a Mockingbird has always been a favourite of mine. I may have done myself a favour years ago when I decided to read the Harper Lee book before watching the film. It still amazes me to this day how exactly similar Robert Duvall's Boo Radley was to the one I pictured in my mind.Mulligan directed a fine film using a well established movie-star (Gregory Peck) and two children who hadn't been in any films previous to this. The performances of the children is of something beyond acting and it is this aspect that makes the film work so well. The film isn't overly long (which it could have very well been) especially throughout the courtroom scene.The issues dealt with during the film were still very touchy at the time this film was released. Perhaps the fact that this film is seen from the young girls viewpoint helps to be almost completely unbiased. The scene in which the lynching mob tries to get at Atticus and Tom shows the innocence of Scout, especially during her discussion with the father of one of her classmates. The whole basis of this film is the innocence of the children and how they make their way through the adventures and fears of the summer.I fully recommend this film to all.9/10 stars.",9,2,4,29 June 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A piece of cinematic brilliance
","This film is easily one of the ten best I have ever seen. It seems to have every aspect of what a film needs to be great. 1) Great story 2) Great actors 3) Great direction 4) Great cinematography 5) Great suspense 6) Great story speed. Director David Lean captured each of these elements to almost a perfect level in this anti-war film.Alec Guiness gives a great performance as Col. Nicholson and was indeed Oscar-worthy. The passion with which he had for the role is best shown at the conclusion of the film in which he finally realizes that all he had done was wrong. Performances from Holden, Hayakawa and Hawkins all match the level of Guiness' intensity. The whole conflict between the British and Japanese is never really described but one gets a better sense of it through the great performances.The one thing that really got me about this film was the manner in which it was shot. The picture quality is very much up to modern standards and seems all that more incredible when compared to other colour films of the day. Jack Hildyard's cinematography full captures the feeling of struggle and conquer throughout the film, especially in later scenes including the destruction of the bridge. Full credit to Boulle's book for coming up with such an interesting way to destroy the bridge.The visual and psychological complexities of this film make it truly great among all films, not just war films. After all, who could forget that famous whistling tune?9/10 stars.",9,0,1,10 January 1999
The Waterboy," Hilarious!!
","When watching the Waterboy, one cannot expect this movie to be a film. Don't look for a great story, interesting performances or even wonderful cinematography because that is not what the producers intended. You simply watch this movie to laugh.I feel that many people have been too harsh on Adam Sandler for this movie's lack of a credible story. After all, any football fan would realize that the tackles made by the 180? lb waterboy wouldn't inflict damage on people much larger than he. Sure, even his accent is awful, but it is there to make you laugh.Kathy Bates had the only good performance in this movie as 'Mama', the overprotective mother of Bobby Boucher (Sandler). Henry Winkler gives an acceptable performance, although it always seems as if he really doesn't want to be in this movie.There are many funny gags that will make you laugh, albeit not like those in 'There's Something About Mary', but still generally well done. Sandler probably could have done more than rely an his accent, stuttering and outright belief in every word his Mama says to make this a better movie. Look for Rob Schneider with a line that is funny the first two times, however, loses its affect the other ten times he says it. Also look for Clint Howard as 'Paco'.The Waterboy has nothing on Sandler's last film 'The Wedding Singer', but we all need our break every now and then, don't we? Recommendations to those who want to laugh for an hour and a half, not for those who can't stand Sandler or very weak plots.6/10 stars.",6,1,3,2 April 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," A classic
","After watching this movie, one can only imagine Hannibal Lecter waiting around the corner for them in great anticipation. Yes, this movie has a creepy theme to it that is usually saved for B-grade horror flicks, however it works very well in this intelligent and thought-provoking film. Hopkins performance was one of the ten best I've ever seen. Demme's direction was almost flawless and kept the viewer feeling disturbed throughout the film with his use of uncomfortable situations (ie- someone following you in the dark, being stuck in a well, being locked in a room with no way out). What struck me most about this film was the glorification of Hannibal which seemed to portray him as a good guy even while the viewer knows about his murders, cannibalism and mind-manipulating. I felt good about Hannibal getting free, which really disturbed me.A must-see and must-have for one's video collection. 9/10 stars.",9,1,1,23 October 1998
Ben-Hur," Triumphant story of a man in Christ's time
","This film absolutely dispelled any notions I may have had about it not being great. All I heard in the past from other critics were mainly negative comments about the film's pro-Christian message and at times sluggish pace. This film is a true masterpiece and of epic standards.Charlton Heston gives a formidable performance in the title role. Could anyone have played it better? Highly unlikely. Heston's performance reminds me of his other great performance in 'The Ten Commandments', powerful at most, however, showing compassion and a desire to help out his fellow man at other times. All supporting roles are played very well, including the spiteful Pontious Pilate. An interesting note to this film is the fact that the front of Jesus is never shown on camera. The audience only sees him from behind, perhaps because the filmmakers felt it unecessary to give any lines to a man who at many times was left unspoken.Ben-Hur was a pleasure to watch, especially in its widescreen format. After all, the only way to watch the greatest moments captured on film (The Chariot Race ) is the way it was meant to be seen. Highly Recommended.9/10 stars.",9,0,2,2 June 1999
Rear Window," My favourite Hitch
","Rear Window really has to be the Seinfeld of Film. The film really is about nothing, yet succeeds in being one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is superb, plot is very original and of course Hitchcock's direction brings the ordinary to extraordinary.The film revolves around the theme of privacy or otherwise the lack of it. Jimmy Stewart plays Jeff, a photographer who is confined to his home and his wheelchair after an accident. With nothing to do, he spends his days watching the antics of his neighbours through the rear window of his apartment. Other than daily visits from a nurse (Thelma Ritter)and periodic visits from his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), he basically eats, sleeps and watches the every action of his neighbours.The story takes an interesting twist when Jeff figures that one of the neighbours he has been wacthing has killed his wife. Jeff brings this up with his girlfriend, nurse and an old wartime pal who is now a detective. At first, each of them have their doubts about Jeff's beliefs, however, it is only a matter of time until each of them are drawn into the situation as well. The last half hour of this film is done perfectly; incredibly suspenseful and yet not overpowering or unbelievable.Grace Kelly's performance in this film is probably her best. The introduction of her into this film is remarkable and probably the object of many mens' fantasies. She maintains a level of being something more than just Jeff's girlfriend throughout the film and has incredible chemistry with Stewart, something that isn't seen in most other films. Thelma Ritter plays well in a slightly comical role as the nurse who stays true to Jeff even though he is a man that she hardly even knows. Orson Wells has such a minor role in this film and spends 95% of his screen time being watched, not heard. However, in his confrontation, he strikes fear in the viewer without even being heard before the scene.This film is on my top ten list and deserves more exposure than other more popular Hitchcock films (Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho). Hitchcock surely did well here.9/10 stars.",9,1,4,20 January 1999
The Truman Show," Interesting Story, could have done more with it
","I finally watched the Truman Show after all of the talk I had heard about it and all of the articles I had read. I really had high expectations for the film that was supposingly 'robbed' of a Best Picture Nomination. I must say I felt let down.Anyone who thinks that Jim Carrey's performance is Oscar-worthy is insanely out of their mind. Saying that is similar to asking why Tom Hanks didn't get an Oscar nod for 'The 'burbs.' Carrey gives a decent performance that to me differed in no way from any of the performances that he has done before. There are still elements of his comic side (scene in which he drives around in circles trying to foil the other cars) present here and he really never comes through with any element of real drama, it all seems fake. However, who knows? Hanks started his acting career by doing mainly comedies until Philadelphia and look what happened to him.The film itself is directed well by Peter Weir who I felt had so much potential to use other interesting facets of the life of Truman. It seems that we are given a quick intro into the life of Truman and are all too quickly rushed into his ploy to get out of the dome and fly to Fiji. If only the first half of the film was devoted to what life is like for Truman and some of the neat ways everything that he does ends up on camera, this film could have been much better. We are hardly introduced to his family, friend and co-workers before the film turns on itself and leaves a lot of interesting issues untouched.The Truman show is a good film overall, however, not even close to the near-greatness achieved in two of the Best Picture nominees that I have seen so far (Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare In Love). I guess I'll have to look to EdTV for more of what I was looking for.7/10 stars.",7,2,4,26 March 1999
Jackie Brown," Another Tarantino masterpiece
","Jackie Brown is one of those films that leaves you satisfied after a showing. Tarantino did very well, rather than what a lot of others have to say. Those who complain about the film's length should stick to a lesser story, something that isn't as layered as this Elmore Leonard adaptation.The acting in this film is superb. Whoever casted the film deserves a mention as well as Tarantino. From Samuel L. Jackson to Robert DeNiro to Chris Tucker in a more subdued role, all are in perfect character throughout. However, if there is anyone who steals the show it is Pam Grier. Grier delivers a powerhouse performance and just like Travolta in Pulp Fiction, I hope this manages to resurrect her film career. The camerawork on Grier at the beginning of the film as she walks through the airport and later while she is walking through the mall is a perfect example of how one can have an effect on a film without dialogue. This film ranks up there with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and still manages to do so without the use of gratuitous violence. The story is also presented in flashback sequences like Pulp Fiction, but again in a lesser form. Tarantino is a master with using differemt film techniques and angles and even threw in a split screen to sharpen the 70's effect. Another shot of Grier that speaks volumes in right after she has made the money switch. Frantic looking, she makes her way through the mall and seems lost and confused. As she turns around looking for someone, Tarantino circles her with the camera creating a state of confusion, then instantly stops this as she calls out a name. Moments like this are what make Tarantino one of the best directors of all time.Tarantino is using another Leonard story as the basis of his next film and if it follows suit in the 'Jackie Brown' genre, it will surely be another success.A full recommendation for this film.8/10 stars.",8,0,1,26 August 1999
Goodfellas," Scorsese's Best
","If there was a film that could come close to being better than my favourite film of all time, it would be GoodFellas. This film is so well done, it left me thinking about it for days. Martin Scorsese took a credible true story (based on the book 'Wiseguy'), a superb cast (Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Peschi, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino) and did his usual magic creating interesting shots and a film that flows very smoothly.Some might say that GoodFellas has nothing on either of the first two Godfather films, however, I have to disagree. The Godfather films were based on a family and the happenings throughout the years, while GoodFellas takes a much simpler story about a local group of Mafioso and the problems they have with themselves. Where the Godfather films trace the wars between the mafioso, GoodFellas traces the wars within a single group of mafioso.I don't think there has ever been a more abrupt and to the point opening sequence than the one in this film. It prepares you for the violence and vulgarity to come, although there was less of it than I thought there would be. Contrary to what others say about this being a showcase for the ugly side of the mob, there are more great dramatic scenes than violent ones.Perhaps this was the best film of the 90's, but who really cares. GoodFellas will remain in my mind as one of the greatest of all time, and as such I fully recommend this film to all. Watch for Samuel L. Jackson in a small bit role (I believe he even says a word or two).9/10 stars.",9,0,0,15 June 1999
The Godfather," THE BEST
","There is no doubt in my mind concerning the fact that The Godfather is the best movie of all time. From the flawless directing to the powerful acting, this movie is a must for every home video collection. Even today this movie still has the elements of surprise and shock which the majority of older movies no longer hold. Who could ever forget the memorable horse head scene. How the AFI ranked this movie number three still baffles me to this day. Coppola put his best forward and left all others behind.",9,1,3,19 September 1998
