First Man," Typical Ryan G. Movie
","I found this movie slow and weird. Typical Ryan Gosling movie. I did however feel like it portrayed a different view on what it was like to fly a plane in 1960s at high altitudes. Also a dark look at what it's like to strap into a cockpit of a rocket and blast into space. I know the new thing with movies, is to show a dark view. But I did not like this movie. Was Neal Armstrong really suck a dark person? I don't know the guy.",4,2,3,16 February 2019
