Howl's Moving Castle," Fowl
","I honestly don't know what the big deal is with Howl's Moving Castle. I just don't understand why everyone's gushing over it. I get the feeling some top reviewer said they thought it was good and everyone else just decided to agree with him/her. I love fantasy movies, I love Studio Ghibli (usually), but this was just taking the mick - great animation ruined by an incoherent story; it just made no sense at all. If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought this was done by Hayao's son - who's take on the Tales of Earthsea was also absolutely horrendous (see my review for that movie), in fact Howl's is just as bad. Studio Ghibli has had some really great hits, but they've also got a good chunk of misfires, and when they do, you really know - you get that sinking feeling, you're bored, you don't know what's going on, and everything seems to happen randomly.",1,5,14,7 December 2012
Skyfall," Bloody Brilliant!
","Loved it, loved it, loved it! I had my doubts after watching the debacle that was Quantum of Solace, but I absolutely loved Skyfall. I think Skyfall is possibly my favourite of the Bond movies so far. I know purists out there are going to lynch me for not choosing one of the Connery-era films, but the fact is I didn't grow up watching Connery, I grew up with Roger Moore as Bond, so I never got to know the classic Bond. What I like most about the Daniel Craig Bond movies is that they are a lot more realistic, unlike the Moore and Brosnan ones. The crises in the Craig-era movies can actually happen in our reality (some might actually be happening right now) which makes it scary. I think the choice of director really made a difference here; Mendes has that good balance of visual flair, attention to character and story, and keeping the action tight and intense (a la Bourne). While Solace director Marc Foster is more suited to the smaller, intimate, agenda-driven dramas. Craig is on usual good form, I like Craig as Bond because we can relate to him; he puts on a tough demeanour, but his eyes betray his vulnerability. Judy Dench does a great job as M; I'm glad she gets more to do in Skyfall than just bark orders at Bond and covering his arse. Another sigh of relief is how subdued the women are in Skyfall. Usually the women take up too much screen time and are there just for eye-candy, although as a guy I love that, but it's very distracting! Javier Bardem is on creepy mode that makes his Chigurh character in No Country for Old Men seem tame by comparison; here's a guy who's actually a threat with brains and brawn to match. Ultimately, it's bloody brilliant!",10,3,13,29 November 2012
United 93," Intense
","Infuriated, confused and scared - these are just some of the emotions that I had after watching the movie, which I'm sure were just some of the emotions director Paul Greengrass was trying to instill in the viewer. Greengrass really captured the realism, the fear, and the panic of the United 93 in a taut, intense and compact 111 minutes, which is much less time needed by most films these days to even reach the final act. Greengrass' use of hand-held camera does 2 things: one, brings the viewer into the action, so you feel like you're watching events unfold from their point of view. Two, the shaky camera enhances the feelings of confusion and fear. Interestingly, an entire cast of unknowns helps to underline the point that the passengers were all strangers to each other (and to us), but as the movie progresses a few of the passengers really stand out and you know them as 'the guy with the cap' or 'the woman with the glasses', which is pretty realistic if you think about it: in times of desperation and intense pressure, you probably won't go through the proper introductions and you'll bond with each other and recognise each other by appearance. United 93 was an incredibly smart and taut treatise on the terrible and ill-fated flight; it doesn't take sides or point fingers, but it does try to tell an honest and brave story from all perspectives.",10,1,2,8 November 2012
The Hunger Games," Unoriginal
","Blame Twilight! Ever since Twilight came out, all these teen flicks have been a variation of Twilight. Hunger Games is no different, it's just Twilight with teenagers trying to kill each other, oh wait, it IS Twilight, minus werewolves and vampires. The cheesy predictability associated with these teen flicks is in check; in a dystopian future, annually a bunch of teens are pitted against each other in the titular event until only one of them is left standing, all in the name of entertainment. Hunger Games thinks it's smart and different, but I couldn't help thinking I've seen it all before, with young Japanese actors and actresses. Oh yes, I have! 2000's Battle Royale starring Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano. Royale did it way better though: the concept is more credible and in a way, more scary - the youth of Japan are out of control, so a program is introduced to discipline/punish (delete as appropriate) them; the youths are selected by high school class, they are sent to an undisclosed island where they are to kill each other until one is left. The catch? They're wearing explosive collars, any tampering with them will blow their heads off. Now, that's a much more effective concept! For Hunger Games the final nail in the coffin is when Woody Harrelson's Haymitch convinces Wes Bentley's character to give the rioting public something to root for - 'young love'! I literally cringed and almost gagged when I saw that scene! Avoid, avoid, avoid! Watch Battle Royale instead, you'll be grateful that you did.",1,26,35,1 March 2013
Argo," Quit the Hatin'
","At first I was a little pensive about this movie because of all the hoopla and fuss surrounding the real historical facts of the story (or lack thereof), especially with the Canadians, and I now live in Canada. Every second person I encountered would mention how it was actually the Canadians that pulled off the rescue etc. Get over it people! The same thing happened with Braveheart (I'm from Scotland) and U-571. I used to feel strongly against movies that are supposedly based on true stories or fact, but now I just don't care; it's an American movie, so the heroes are going to be American! It's an American movie so the heroes are whoever they bloody well choose! The day Canada makes a similar movie, that's the day they can correct the historical inaccuracies! Let's just enjoy Argo for it is; a phenomenal effort from Ben Affeck, a taut and intense thriller with moments of sly humour, especially from John Goodman and Alan Arkin, and solid acting from the rest of the players. For what it's worth, the story-line does actually acknowledge Canada for its efforts when it could easily just overlook it.",8,1,2,7 June 2013
Point Break," Pointless Break
","Wow, can anybody say 'product placement'? Absolutely terrible. Just as I thought it would be. This poor take on the classic is a complete travesty in every way possible; essentially it's a shameless extended Red Bull or GoPro commercial. In every frame there's an outdoor equipment or extreme sports brand in full view, front and center. There's really no plot to speak of, I think there's something about an FBI agent trying catch some bad guys, and that's about it. Even the main character seems to forget WTF he's supposed to be doing. For a bit in the middle I really did forget what the hell he was supposed to be doing. It's really a poor excuse to film beautiful young people doing dangerous sports. The acting is nonexistent and even when there is some acting, it's horrific to say the least. Now I know why Edgar Ramirez doesn't get much to say in whatever movies he's in because the guy is just terrible, he's as stiff as the rock that he throws over the cliff. To be honest I don't understand the hype around the guy. The lead guy - I don't even know who TF he is - playing Utah is an insult to the great Keanu Reeves. The lines are completely laughable, they're like lines ripped straight from Robin Sharma's The Monk who Sold His Ferrari - just some voodoo, mystic mumbojumbo about being one with the earth or some BS like that. Which is sort of ironic because they spend most of the movie ripping the earth apart with motor bikes, guns, bombs and whatever they can get their tattooed hands on. Completely pointless, avoid at all costs, watch the infinitely superior original and forget this tosh ever existed.",1,4,4,13 June 2017
The Others," Moody!
","I'm not usually a horror film fan; they tend to be schlocky, clichéd and full of characters that absolutely deserve whatever they get. But I am a fan of the more psychological horror films; The Others ticks all the right boxes for me. It has no special effects or gore for that matter, so it relies on moody lighting, a tense score, great acting and storytelling - at some points in the film, a combination of these things actually make broad daylight seem creepy. My only snagging point is the disease that the children have - they're photosensitive - so any exposure to sunlight will kill them. This is the basic set-up that the whole movie is based on, at first it may seem like a poor excuse to keep the house in perpetual darkness, but gradually it becomes a revelatory plot point. Now, if you're sharp, this light-sensitive ploy will be a dead giveaway right from the start.",9,1,2,23 March 2012
Aquaman," Sharkboy and Lava Girl was Way Better!
","Oh man, what a waste of 2.5 hours! I'm really not understanding why this piece of tosh is getting so much hype. Zero story, non-sensical plot, one-dimensional characters, cringe-worthy dialogue, horrendous production design, costume design looked like they ripped-off the Power Rangers, and the visuals weren't even that great! The 'young-ification' of Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman at the beginning of the movie was absolutely laughable. Manta's - actually all the costumes - looked so cheap and plastic-y it reminded me of those kids' costumes that you get at the Dollar Store. Momoa does his best impersonation of Thor, but ultimately fails to draw any laughs or garner any emotion. They absolutely ripped-off every sci-fi fantasy concept out there, mixed them together and hoped something would stick. It was just a loud, chaotic, brash, flashy, low-brow, seething mess. I think even Sharkboy and Lava Girl did a way better job! Just give up DCEU, you're no match for the MCU, the harder you try the worse you look.",1,7,12,28 June 2019
The Prestige," One of my favourite films of all time
","This has got to be one of the most original films I've ever seen, the idea of magicians pitting their illusionist skills against each other to see who's the first to cross the line is perfect for the sensibilities of Chris Nolan. The movie has his trademark non-chronological storytelling, which is a little confusing at first, but it actually enhances the smoke and mirrors quality of the film; it unfolds just like how the characters play out their tricks - the pledge, the turn, the prestige. The characters are all tortured and haunted in some way, what started off as friendly competition escalates into an obsessive bitter rivalry where nothing is sacred in order to get the one-up on the other. Simply brilliant!",10,0,1,22 March 2012
The Expendables," Expendable
","Hmmm...with all the action movie stars ever starring in an action movie you'd expect something special, but you'd be wrong. The Expendables is as loud, dumb and flashy as you'd expect, but it's just no fun. Surprisingly, there's not much action in it neither, well, not nearly as much as I expected. The fight scenes were pretty lousy too; you couldn't see what anybody was doing and when you could see they were pretty unspectacular and uninspired. I was really looking forward to seeing one of my favourite Mixed-Martial Artists - Randy Couture - in hand-to-hand combat, but he hardly fought, in fact he was hardly in the movie. For a movie that boasts all the action stars ever, shouldn't we be going from set-piece to set- piece that showcases the things that we made us love these action stars in the first place? All in all, I never expected Oscar-worthy material, but for an action movie and given the action talent on hand it was really unoriginal, uninspired and just plain boring. But still, at least it's better than Prometheus!",4,2,4,21 January 2013
Elf," Hell-f
","Absolutely terrible! Another example of a great concept ruined by execution; the idea is pretty original, but the direction, the lead and the supporting cast are just horrendous. There was one word that went through my mind all the way through the movie - embarrassing. I just felt embarrassed for the characters and the situations they were put in, they were just not funny. I guess I was undecided about Will Ferrell, I thought I liked him, but this movie finally tipped me over to the 'I hate him' category. He's just not funny! He's shouty and creepy; as the titular elf, his man-child schtick is getting really annoying. All the other actors in the movie don't even seem to want to be seen on-screen with him because they're that embarrassed! They're just there to collect a paycheck! The whole movie is an undercooked mess.",1,6,18,2 December 2012
Oblivion," Obvious-ion?
","Very disappointing. There were too many things going on at the beginning trying to set the scene; so you're starting to think that the plot is thickening, but ultimately amount to nothing more than a hill of beans. The production is beautiful though (as is Olga Kurylenko), but that's really it, it's all eye candy and nothing much else. There's not even that much acting to speak about neither. The plot is confusing and very very thin - in the back of your mind you're thinking of the most obvious resolution to the movie, but you're led to believe that there should be more to it than what you're thinking, by the end of the movie though, you'll discover that you were right all along. You'll be thinking: 'Is THAT it?!' It's really really predictable. The characters are 2-dimensional and the dialogue is extremely clichéd and cheesy - Jack Harper (to Olga): 'Dream of us' - really??? Come on guys! No wonder the prominently massive space station is shaped like a chunk of very-mature cheddar!",5,0,2,24 September 2013
Divergent," Diver-junk
","Not as bad as I thought it would be, I kind of expected another Twilight or Hunger Games; although Divergence does have it's Twilight moments. The movie does actually make me think and is pretty smart in parts, especially the Tris vs Jeanine scene towards the end, despite it's predictability. To be honest, I rather enjoyed the movie until all the corny lovey-dovey scenes between Tris and Four; the movie minus the Tris and Four 'romantic' parts would've raised the movie's stock in my book. Another thing that would've helped was to revise the completely lame ending, which doesn't quite make sense, is totally anti-climactic and is obviously screaming out: 'SEQUEL!'. Lastly,I was hoping there'd be some explanation as to why they had to live within the boundaries of the city, apart from Tris narrating at the beginning that there was a 'war' - which I don't fully believe, so I hoped there'd be a twist ending, but it never came. Actually the more I think about it, the more I dislike it and the more critisicism i can think of. So in the end, yeah, I didn't like it.",2,1,1,14 November 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Twilight with Spiders
","Not good not bad. Thankfully I went into this knowing that it will be different from Raimi's Spider-Man. There are things I liked about Raimi's version and Marc Webb's version.Here's what I liked and didn't like about both movies - 1) I still like the idea that Spidey's web-shooting ability being a genetic mutation rather than coming from a device. 2) Maguire was suitably geeky and nerdy as Peter Parker. 3) Garfield's Peter Parker was too cocksure to be convincing that he'd ever be bullied at school, have trouble making friends or get the girls. Also his version of Spider-Man was too cocky. 4) Raimi's style meant the movie had a horror comedy feel which made it stand out from the other polished and shiny superhero movies. 5) Although typical of most superheroes, Raimi's Parker's desire to keep his identity a secret to protect his loved ones makes the character richer and easier to root for. Whilst Webb's Parker seems to be a lot more immature and reckless with his powers; like a teenager who seems disinterested in anything else except getting the girl. 6) Uncle Ben - I prefer Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben way more than Cliff Robertson's. 7) Aunt May - Sally Field's Aunt May doesn't seem to have much more to do than pout around the house waiting for Peter to come home. However, I'm not sure if I prefer this or Rosemary Harris' naggy version. 8) Raimi's montage of Peter's realisation, acceptance and transformation into Spider-Man was more fun to watch and more structured; it showed the process. Whereas Webb's montage was more like a Nike commercial or music video. 9) The pace of Webb's movie was a little uneven, it just jumped from one set-piece to another before the previous one has finished. 10) In Webb's Spider-Man, I do appreciate the implications of Peter's mysterious family history and shadowy parents, which wasn't even hinted at in Raimi's, but ultimately it didn't really have any real impact on the story, unlike the background of the Hulk for example.All in all, The Amazing Spider-Man feels rather unnecessary and excessive just now, since Raimi's Spider-Man movies are still fresh in the public consciousness. Also, it feels too much like Twilight with superheroes/supervillains. I'm leaning more towards Raimi's Spider-Man as the more superior movie.",2,1,3,10 January 2013
Cars," Deflated!
",After the superb effort that was The Incredibles (arguably my favourite Pixar movie to date) I was extremely hyped for the next entry; regardless of how preposterous and silly it sounded because this is Pixar! They don't make mistakes! Or so I thought - what I thought to be a ridiculous idea turned out to be correct - talking cars?! They really dropped the ball with Cars. The whole talking cars thing may have worked decades ago with Herbie the Lovebug but it doesn't work for the 21st century; I couldn't help thinking that I was just watching one long toy commercial. I'm usually a big fan of Owen Wilson - he's usually about the best thing in a movie in my opinion - but not even he can save this mess. Imagine actually falling asleep in a Pixar movie! That's how bad it was; I'll definitely be skipping Cars 2.,1,2,3,21 August 2012
Mr. Nobody," Corn & Cheese
","I went into this movie with high expectations due to the ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, so I thought such respectable and trustworthy sources can't be wrong. However, in this instance, oh my, were they off the mark. For me anyway. I just thought the movie was completely unoriginal and pretentious; there have been many movies before - The Fountain to name one - that have explored the same themes and executed to greater effect. After many (convoluted and schmaltzy) story lines about what might have happened in Nemo's (even the name is pretentious) life if he had made different decisions, in the end you'll find that the whole thing was absolutely pointless; the story takes you on this long long twisty journey only to lead you back to where you were. What makes it worse is the script; the lines and acting were so so corny they'll choke a mule!",1,14,29,20 October 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne-Lite
","Hmmmm...I think I'm safe to say that this was a bit of a disappointment. I was looking forward to this when it was first announced, despite the slight inkling in the back of my mind that this will suck without the involvement of either Matt Damon or Paul Greengrass; I should've listened to that inkling. Not only does it lack the brains of the previous Bourne movies, it also lacks the brawn. The story is just a rehash of the basic premise of Identity; assassin goes in search of the people who have wronged him while trying to fill-in the gaps in his dodgy memory. Except this time, they added that horrendous twist about Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross and his contemporaries being genetically modified, giving them their enhanced abilities; and they have to take these drugs to maintain these abilities. Aaron Cross needs his meds so he goes in search for them while government types are trying to terminate the program that made him what he is. So basically it's a movie about a drug addict looking for his next score! Renner does his best with what he's been given, while Weisz is unconvincing as the scientist who's trying to help him; the problem here is that they have no chemistry, so whenever they're on-screen together it feels really uncomfortable and awkward. Ed Norton's character is kinda pointless. The pace of the movie is a bit flabby, while the previous movies were lean, taut, concise and tense, with plenty of action to help the flow of the movies; Legacy doesn't have any of that. The action scenes are few and far between, even when there's action, they're really just uninspired retreads of what's gone before. I think I'll suddenly develop amnesia on this one and forget that this travesty ever happened.",5,0,4,21 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not-So-Amazing Spiderman
","Oh man, this was absolutely horrendous - even worse than the first one. The characters are paper-thin, the actors are terrible (except Jamie Foxx, more on that later), the lines are cringe-worthy and the story makes no sense at all. Oh, and it's also very, very clichéd; Peter finds his dad's secret lab in an abandoned subway line, he even needs a special coin to make it come up out of the train tracks! WTF??? The story has more holes than Spiderman's web, for example: how come Spiderman seems to be impervious to Electro's shocks? What does Peter actually do except for hanging around looking cool with his big hair and hipster style? What exactly was wrong with Harry? Peter's relationship with Harry Osborn is pretty random and rushed, but Harry somehow expects Peter to do everything in his power to help him. Dane DeHaan playing Harry is just a rehash of his character in Chronicle, but this time he's a spoilt rich kid who didn't get enough hugs as a child. Man, how I miss James Franco's Harry, I actually felt for Franco's Harry: he was likable and you totally felt his pain. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have absolutely no chemistry at all, despite them actually dating in real-life at the time the movie was made, if they're on-screen relationship is so flaccid, I can't imagine what their real one must be like! Their lines are probably the corniest, cheesiest tripe I've ever heard, every time they spoke I gagged! It's 'I love you' every second word, they toss those words out so casually that they don't mean anything and lack impact. With Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, you can actually feel his struggle precisely because he doesn't say he loves Mary Jane after every second word. This brings me to Peter Parker himself, Garfield plays him with such swagger, cockiness and bravado that I really don't like him, and I find it really difficult to root for him. Tobey's Peter was a fantastic balance of vulnerability, geekiness and determination that you can't help but cheer for him and you can relate to him. The one saving grace was Jamie Foxx's Electro character - we actually understand his plight and we feel for him; who hasn't ever been trampled on by everyone and wished you had the means to fight back? When he does become Electro, he's probably the coolest villain ever i.e; when he turns into pure electricity and disappears into a power socket. He's actually a very scary villain and I wish they kept him somehow instead of cooking up some bullsh*t way to kill him. Another note on cliché: the scientist who runs the institute for the criminally insane where they keep Electro is an over-the-top neo-nazi-scientist type, he's even German!",1,5,32,10 December 2014
Lincoln," Where's all the Vampires?
","So disappointed...not one vampire to be seen! I thought Abraham Lincoln was famous for hunting down vampires? Only kidding...but wouldn't that have made a much better movie? 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' - oh wait...nevermind. I just didn't like this movie, what I thought would be an inspirational and powerful story in the same vein as Schindler's List turned out to be a shallow, politics-drenched snoozer. Perhaps it was my limited grasp of American history and politics that led to my limited enjoyment of the movie while other people seemed to appreciate immensely. Plus, we all know what happened with Lincoln anyway, so the movie doesn't really shed any new light on the man. Either way, in my opinion, Spielberg should stay away from movies based on the American Civil War or most importantly Slavery - neither The Color Purple or Amistad did very well.",3,1,5,30 May 2013
Grave of the Fireflies," Incredibly Poignant
","Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli has churned out consistently high- quality 2D animation in the last few decades. Grave of the Fireflies is a lesser-known Studio Ghibli production. As per any Studio Ghibli film, the animation is top-notch 2D, lovingly hand-drawn and the story is simple but relevant. Fireflies tells the story of a brother and sister who are orphaned after their village is bombed during WW2. We follow them as they face their struggles; from living with an unsympathising relative to making a home for themselves in a couple of crevices on the river bank. As the days go by things get more and more desperate for the siblings, as food gets scarce and illnesses start to take their toll. What I like about Ghibli's movies is that they're astonishingly brave; there's no comfort zone here, nothing's sugar-coated. The final scene tugs at the heart- strings and will stay with you for a long long time.",10,0,1,31 October 2012
Brave," Felt Like Dreamworks...
","I think the title says it all. Brave was a fantastic movie, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't Pixar - there are fantastic movies and there are Pixar movies that usually blows all competition out of the water - except Cars of course, but I'll leave that rant for another time. Brave had a lot of charm, magic, great characters and attention to detail, but all the way through I couldn't help feeling that one or two things were missing - humour and storytelling. When I distinguish what makes a Pixar movie different from say, a Dreamworks movie it always came down to humour and storytelling, which Brave didn't seem to have, hence it felt more like a Dreamworks movie. All the way through I was waiting for the laugh-aloud jokes that I've come to expect from a Pixar movie, but they never came. Yes, there were a few chuckle moments, but that was it - the jokes never really hit the mark. There's a part where Merida's three younger brothers are turned into bear cubs which had a lot of potential for jokes and plot development, but they were largely ignored. On a side note, the adult bears are actually pretty scary. The story also felt very mediocre - haven't we heard this one thousands of times before? A princess is to be wedded off but she doesn't want to, she wants her freedom, so she does something stupid that she regrets and she has to make amends, and everyone learns a lesson - there, I just told you the whole story, which is another reason why it felt like a Dreamworks movie, it lacked the usual creativity and imagination that makes Pixar great. I just hope their next effort will be a return to form; Brave had it's flaws but it's still not nearly as bad as Cars!",6,1,4,26 June 2012
Drag Me to Hell," Hellish!
","I'm not a huge fan of Sam Raimi, with the exception of the Spider-Man trilogy, I tend to stay away from his movies, but something 'dragged' me to this movie. I probably just wanted something scary with a twisted sense of humour and an interesting premise. The premise was interesting - young woman refuses to help an old gypsy woman and gets cursed by said old woman. However, I got none of the scares or the laughs, what I got was a predictable and frustrating load of tosh that had every horror flick cliché ever devised; the windows suddenly bursting open, the spectre behind the curtain, the cursed objects, the rituals etc, etc, the list goes on and on, even the ending is clichéd and predictable. Just terrible.",1,0,2,29 November 2012
The Artist," Spectacular!
","Loved this movie. In a world where flashy special effects, shallow characters, non-existent plots and unbridled sex and violence rule the silver screen, it's so refreshing to see a movie that goes back to basics - literally! At first I thought the whole concept of a modern-day movie filmed like a silent movie would be pretentious and self-righteous, but it proved to be highly original. The characters have a lot of heart and you really do care about them; especially George's dog, who - in my humble opinion - really steals the show. The silent part doesn't detract from the storytelling at all as I thought it might, but with actors as good as these, you can tell exactly what they're conveying to each other just by the facial expressions, the look of their eyes and the score - which is magnificent by the way, and absolutely spot on.",10,0,2,22 March 2012
La La Land," Blah Blah Land
","I really don't know what the big fuss was about this film. Admittedly it was beautifully shot and produced, the music and little dance numbers were brilliant, and it was visually stunning; the whole thing reminded me of a Chagall painting. I would say that was my favourite thing about the movie; it's all very romantic looking and stylish. However, these things were all smoke and mirrors to me, to hide the fact that the story was shallow and pretentious. It just wasn't all that interesting and couldn't hold my attention. Is it just me or do Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling just seem to play the same people in every one of their movies? I feel like they're the same no matter what roles they play (it's the same with Ryan Reynolds) as though their acting spectrum is very limited so they can't take on a wide variety of diverse roles. In a nutshell: beautifully made and visually striking, but rather uninteresting story and uninspired acting. Totally not deserving of all the Oscars.",5,4,7,2 September 2017
Downfall," Completely Overrated
","Oh my goodness! What can I say about this film? I had heard so much about this movie, mostly good and positive things, so I wanted to check it out for myself. A WW2 movie from the perspective of Hitler during his last days - intriguing premise and should make a brilliant piece of film right? Boy, was I disappointed; this has got to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's full or clichés, about an hour and a half too long and the pace is incredibly slow - you won't believe how many times I thought to myself: 'just get it over and done with already!' - even I wanted to kill myself by the halfway mark. But by then I had stopped caring. It does nothing to tell us anything new or refreshing about Hitler's last days, so the whole thing was just completely pointless. Yes, it's supposed to capture just how desperate they all became as the Russians closed in and the leader gradually lost his mind; as if he didn't I suppose the one saving grace of this absolutely terrible movie is Bruno Ganz's portrayal of the Fuhrer; he absolutely nails the great leader down to every little mannerism and nervous tick; you'd think Hitler himself had come back from the dead to be in this movie. But then, not even top-notch acting by Ganz can save this awful movie from its 'downfall'.",1,4,28,12 July 2012
Prometheus," All Style, No Substance
","Really disappointed to say the least - I was expecting something epic and mythical to add to the canon of Alien and Aliens. Looks like Scott was trying too hard and tried to juggle too many ideas at once; so the end result is a mish-mash of half-baked ideas and red herrings - just when you think you know what direction the movie's taking and you think you've got it sussed, Scott will throw in another random idea that's unrelated to the other plot points before it that'll take the whole thing in a different direction. You'll be left wondering how the characters went from one plot point to another, for example; at what point did Idris Elba and his crew actually realise the danger they're in and the imminent threat to humanity that they become so heroic as to sacrifice themselves? They were hardly involved! What was the purpose of Charlize Theron's character?? How the hell did the dead Engineer get from the shuttle wreckage back to his own ship to position himself for the start of Alien? Overall, stunning visuals but this is a confused, mediocre effort.",4,5,7,7 January 2013
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Can't Stand Wes Anderson!!!
","To me - and I know many, many people will disagree - Wes Anderson is another one of those directors whose movies I only like one of - I actually quite enjoyed The Life Aquatic (mostly because of Bill Murray and the quality stop-motion animation), but that's it. Everything else he does is just irritatingly boring, dull and completely unfunny. I've tried to like his movies, but I just can't. I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind. This review is applicable to all Wes Bentley films (except Aquatic), so hopefully I won't have to keep repeating myself. Oh, another thing; I absolutely can't stand Jason Schwartzman! SOMEBODY PLEASE kill his acting career!",7,12,25,9 August 2012
Princess Mononoke," Still Pretty Bad
","I still don't understand why Studio Ghibli's movies are such a big hit, perhaps I never will. I swear the Japanese culture loses something in translation: the characters are so annoying. The Japanese probably like their young male characters to be all mopey, melancholic, effeminate, Emo's, and the young female characters to be clingy, whiny, immature brats! However, Princess Mononoke isn't quite as bad Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Ponyo, Tales of Earthsea etc, but it's still pretty bad. At least this one has something that remotely resembles a story and characters that (sort of) make sense (but they're still annoying as hell!) - heck, there's even a subtext!",1,7,31,10 December 2012
