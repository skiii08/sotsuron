Despicable Me 2," This movie tried too hard to play it safe.
","I loved the first 'Despicable Me', as it was a great movie. All the ingredients were there: The anti-hero Gru using three orphan girls to take on the world, while they use him to evade their orphanage and in the course of actions they all find themselves being a family. Simple and beautiful. Hence i was skeptical when i found out there was a second movie coming. And rightly so.Sure, for itself it still is an acceptable movie with cute jokes. But it doesn't have the emotional values of the first one. The story is a slapstick secret agent plot garnished with some superficial coming-of-age ideas and a kitschy love-story. Nothing serious, about the depth of an average sitcom. It just plays safe.And by doing that it sorta kicks the soul of its predecessor overboard. The worst is how the mandatory happy-end is handled. If you already bought the DVD, spare yourself the last five minutes, as they feel glued on with sugar icing. But honestly, spare yourself the whole movie, it's hardly the same quality as the first one.",4,0,1,7 December 2013
Blade Runner 2049," Style over substance.
","This was the worst Villeneuve movie i've seen so far, which is quite a testament to his work. Compared to his previous outstanding movies Blade Runner 2049 is only ... good.Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship. The imagery is mesmerizing. Alas, the story just can't hold up. For once the main ideas of the script, even though executed quite well, didn't really thrill me. While that isn't killing the mood on its own, the characters were far from convincing. Several times it was far from plausible what motivated certain actions of the protagonists. At times it felt like scenes were in the movie for the sole purpose of feeling cool while not having any influence on the advancement of the story whatsoever. I'm okay with a little red herring here and there, but with this i was left puzzled far too often.The worst offenders here are all scenes with Jared Leto. I like him, but stop casting him as a villain! All his scenes come across as pretentious and over-styled. While he is portraying the head of a business conglomerate which produces replicants, a kind of Elon Musk personality, he comes across more as a spaced off bond villain. A stark contrast to the through and through business man Tyrell from the first movie ('More human than human - that's our motto!'). He's an unpredictable evil, yet his unpredictability serves no purpose throughout the story.My favorites were Dave Bautista and Robin Wright. Both of whom should have been given more screen time as they actually pushed the emotional curve properly. Ryan Gosling portrays a lifeless machine far too lifeless for my taste, i liked him a lot more in 'the nice guys'. Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford, he never really disappoints. The rest of the cast is rather forgettable.This movie not the big disappointment it could have been, there is plenty of reason to be entertained and it sorta keeps up with its predecessor. But neither is it a masterpiece. It tries too hard on various ideas and fails. If you're a real Science Fiction buff, rather watch Arrival. It shows far better what Villeneuve is capable story-wise in this field.",7,6,16,6 October 2017
Gravity," Don't take it for realistic. Enjoy it as the fiction it is.
","Realism flies out of the airlock the moment you see Clooney flying circles around the space-shuttle with his jet-pack. The MMU is such a freakishly expensive piece of hardware it hardly ever got used. And as such these kinds of joyrides just wouldn't be in the mission budget.So yes, this movie stretches reality to enhance drama. Because let's face it, while interesting, watching astronauts doing maintenance missions isn't what i would call 'breathtaking'. But whenever possible physics were portrait in a realistic manner. And in style! Technically this movie is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is so breathtaking, you'd be tempted to blame the vacuum from the silver screen sucking the oxygen out of the cinema. Never was space felt so intensely!The only thing that annoyed me was the script. Clooney acts too airy and Bullock seems too emotional for astronauts. After all these are supposed to be handpicked professionals and yet they react a little too human to those life-threatening situations. In reality they wouldn't have the slightest chance to make it. But well, it's fiction for us 'common' people and i guess we need something more 'human' to relate to. So yea, i can overlook these shortcomings for this fantastic space-spectacle.",8,2,4,6 April 2014
Star Trek," If you want rather mindless action, you're right. If you like Star Trek and/or logic, search elsewhere.
","J.J. Abrahams tries to relaunch the Star Trek franchise and that by itself is a good idea. Yet the realization went wrong in quite some ways.Lets start with what is good: The special effects are the most impressing about this movie. Where as this sounds like a compliment, it's actually already quite a statement, as from here on everything goes down. As J.J. tried to 'renew' the whole thing, he threw the old characters partly over board. The closest reincarnation from my point of view is Karl Urban as Doc 'Bones' McCoy, which reminds quite often to the real one. On second place is Zachary Quinto's Spock, John Cho's Sulu and Anton Yelchin's Chekov, which are all very likable reminiscences of the originals.Kirk, Uhura and Scotty on the other hand turn pale in comparison. Chris Pine overacts the whole 'cool American'-stereotype hitting on everything with long hair and starting a fight whenever drunk. William Shatner had much more class than him. Zoe Saldana is just average in everything and barely strikes me as the 'communication queen'. And Scotty? Oh, please, forget Scotty in this one. Simon Pegg is annoying throughout the movie by barking his one-liners and failing as a comical relief. A pity, as he was much funnier in 'How to Lose Friends'. All in all i felt that the motivations of some of the protagonists were less than comprehensible.The worst though is the screenplay. The story itself is okay, yet the details just ruin every entertainment to be had. Spock himself would have had a hard time watching this illogical mess. Okay, you say action movies don't have to be logical, yet still it hits my personal limit to be entertaining. This is not helped by heavy overuse of shaky camera. It seems that nowadays when something is shaky and far from comprehension, thats action! No, it isn't, thats just slack directors work. Aliens, Terminator, Die Hard ... all great action flicks much without that kind of modern cinematic prestidigitation.So to summarize: If you like action and don't want to think, go for it. Yet this is not what Star Trek was about and that's sad. I wouldn't go so far to call myself a Trekkie, yet i like the old ones well enough to see that in writing quality this isn't near the real thing. And i don't think it was necessary to rewrite major events of the Star Trek universe to pull it off. We have seen a great relaunch of Batman without hurting it's existing universe, so i assumed that it should be possible to repeat the same with Star Trek. I was left disappointed.",5,23,52,12 May 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Was okay for me.
","I didn't go in with huge expectations. I'm a Star Wars fan, but thanks to episode one, two and three i've cooled down to the franchise. Also the geek culture around it got a little too over the top for me.As a movie it's a fun action spectacle. Maybe 'fun' is a little too lighthearted, as the movie has a distinctively dark tone to it. This is the Dark Knight version of Star Wars, one scene literally taking place on black rocks, which makes clear how much the director tried to detach it from the sequels. He overshot the target for my taste.The characters were ... okay? There is a snarky droid, which provides some good comical relieve. There is the blind monk, that seems weirdly insecure after one heroic battle with a whole bunch of storm troopers. He contrasts nicely with the gun-toting grim veteran. There is the girl, which the story revolves around, but her motivations beyond her father seem cloudy at best. There is the master. There is the rogue empire pilot. There is that guy with an English accent. I still don't know what his role was. The movie has problems focusing on characters, it gets quite hard to tell who is doing what for which reason. Even when the protagonists yell it out.The actual plot gets lost in details, in the spectacular action sequences and in a substantial amount of quotes of the original movies. Some subtle, but most almost painfully on the nose. At several occasions they felt forced or full on artificial and should have been omitted. Why call it 'a star wars story', when it features pretty much all what star wars has to offer? I'd have approved more if they had taken the chance to concentrate more in detail on a facet to enrich that universe. Instead it's an entertaining popcorn flick.",7,0,4,20 December 2016
This Is the End," A bunch of Hollywood actors against the end of the world.
","That's pretty much it. Some party boys face Armageddon and fail to deal with it. It's a ludicrous premise, but offers a lot of comical potential.The movie satires all the classic stereotypes of horror and zombie movies: Fight for resources, splitting into groups, outsiders versus insiders, arguments over leadership, trust issues and so on. But Franco and friends persiflage themselves (or better their public image) and act as total morons throughout. You're not here to like these characters as 'good people' and they know it. You're here to watch them stumble through in hilarious fashion and for that the boys present a surprising amount of self irony.As such the movie is rude, explicit and gory. It's humor that gets better with beer. It's stupid, anarchic, yelling and at times whiny and i love it. If you're able to enjoy idiocy on the level of 'Hangover' or 'It's always sunny in Philadelphia', you'll enjoy this one.",8,1,2,10 December 2017
Green Room," It was okay.
","The movie seems to split the opinions, but i cannot really understand why. It was a well done thriller with a nice idea, but lacking a little in the details. Not enough to ruin it, but neither enough to make it hugely rememberable.The actions of the main characters make sense, i wouldn't expect any clever survival tactics from a low-life punk-band, who isn't beneath siphoning gasoline from parked cars. At the same time it's a little hard to sympathize with them for the same reason. Even worse fares the nazi gang, who is out for their blood, but isn't all too smart about how. The threat-level is all over the place. At the beginning it is hinted that the four punks are massively outnumbered, but all confrontations boil down to a handleable two to three nazis at a time.The best about this movie is the gritty atmosphere of the nazi/punk-club, which is well executed onto the screen. Also the good acting.makes this rather watchable, none of the characters felt cheap and Patrick Steward can shine as a softspoken, but evil villain.But in the slightly above average story, the plotholes and the luke-warm ending left me unsatisfied.",8,0,0,21 December 2018
Tangled," A tame joyful film for the whole family. Just no big hit.
","This movie conforms to all rules classical Disney films set up. Old Brothers Grimm story? Check. Boy saves princess? Check. Singing? Check. Sidekicks providing humor? Check. Happy End...? I guess thats barely a spoiler...That is as good a fact as it is bad. It all depends on how one stands toward these. Do you like this rigid screenplay framework? Then you'll probably enjoy this. And as such it probably works for the whole family.I still gave it a 5/10 for being so tame. There isn't any real villain in there, even the old woman isn't evil by heart. The problem i see here is that in this way the male protagonist can't portray the hero as good as the kitschy rest of the movie wants him to be. He's merely a thief and pretty much receives the grand price, the hand of the princess, without all too much deserving it. All he had to do is run off with her, pretty much true to his trade.In my point this is one reason why the classics are the classics and this one never will be. Cinderella, Snow Wite, the Junglebook, Aladdin, Lionking... They all had great villains and thanks to those were great in making heroes. It's a pity that got lost somewhere.",5,3,24,14 May 2011
Interstellar," This is a masterpiece.
","I watched the movie yesterday at my local IMAX-theater and i'm still in shock on how much this movie impressed me. Never was i glued to a chair for almost three hours straight as much as here.The film does just so many things exceptionally well, that it's hard to find words for it. The atmosphere is so tense and immersive, i couldn't lend myself to question anything within this amazingly designed world. The scenario of a dystopian doomed earth is told in a remarkable subtle way. Never do you see apocalyptic catastrophes as in '2012', yet you can almost feel this world crumbling to literally dust before your eyes and the pain of the people who know their fate was creepingly sealed while they continue their now almost senseless worldly duties of farming and watching baseball games.Within such a ingenious set environment any actor could perform remarkably, but the cast does just magnificent, proving their shared 5 academy awards all again. I felt torn apart between all those amazingly believable characters, their motivations and their motives. People who desperately cling to whatever they have left in a ghost of what once was our world. People who take leaps of faith jumping into unknown missions heading for unchartered territories to save whatever they hold dear. People witnessing events incomprehensible to human minds have to deal with unthinkable decisions that push them to the edge of what it means to be human. A gigantic acting task. And yet the cast seems to do it with astonishing ease.The screenplay doesn't mess around either. So much information is packed tight, the movie could have been three times the length and still make a remarkable tense movie. Hence the story at times appears a bit convoluted, but it keeps its edge. And despite the huge amount of emotional topics being touched on, not once does it fall into any of the usual kitschy Hollywood-clichés and -tropes. Instead it keeps a refreshingly sober, at times almost scientific and documentary tone, which gives so much credence to this world.So yes, this is simply a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan blew away any reservations in my mind that Hollywood is still able to impress me deeply. This movie instantly went to my top 3 movies of all times.",10,2,8,8 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars is finally dead.
","I'm not sure wether it's worse or better than Episode VIII. This movie is just utter chaos. Pretty much every scene is created for spectacle or heavy-handed characterization. The majority are hamfistedly lifted from the first trilogy. Famous EPIV-VI imagery is crowbared in without any sensitivity for the symbolism. 'You like Emporer Palpatine, right?' Disney seems to shout in dispair.Nothing flows naturally, most events seem to come out of nowhere and aren't explained in the slightest. Kylo Ren needs to find a thingy. Why? Don't ask. look at the flashy lightsaber. The crew finds an ancient weapon that leads to some important thing. Why? They were lucky i guess, it's not important, look at the shiny lights. The screenplay is absolutely predicteable, even the big twist in the middle is a horrible rehash.The relationships between protagonists feel forced and constructed. Rey and Finn try their best to resemble Han and Leia, but it's done very clumsy and artificial. Not Anakin-PadmÃ©-clumsy, but still far from natural. Lightsabers are swiss army knives for Jedis instead of mystical weapons which should be used with caution. The force is super-powerful, unless the screenplay doesn't want it. Rey jumps around like Super Mario in one scene and struggles heavily to climb a rock in the next. And the humorous scenes mostly fall flat beside some minor exceptions.There are only a few good bits. The lightsaber battles feel a lot less like some ridiculous dance coreography or circus act, but more like a struggle between two opposing characters. And there is a beautiful homage to Carrie Fisher, which actually felt dear, honest and respectful. But most good ideas here are merely touched on and dropped in favour of more spectacle.What little of Star Wars magic remained has finally left the screen. It's now a disney amusement ride, just over two hours long. This is Disney in full blown panic mode, solely relying on hype and fan service to generate revenue. At times it seems like J.J. just wanted to be done with it. This is the director, whose dream was to make Star Wars movies! I was dragged in by friends claiming a need for closure, but i left 30 minutes before the end. It felt like i could spend my time in better ways.Unless you don't give a damn about subtlety, consistency, flow, interesting characters and a lot more central moviemaking guidelines, don't watch this.",3,1743,3243,19 December 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," It's a good movie.
","Some friends saw it and told me it's too Disney-esque. Now that i saw it i would say that's not really the issue here. True, from a gamer point of view it falls a little short on paying tribute to the idea. After the first half hour the video game references are used up, which was a little disappointing. But from a movie point of view it's definitely one of the better animation movies i've seen.This is mostly due to the clever script. It tells the story of two outsiders unwillingly joining forces to archive their dream of being accepted for what they are, each in their own respect. For a recent Disney movie it deals with quite some serious topics like loneliness, peer pressure and social exclusion. And it handles those as respectful as possible in the sugar-sweet environment it takes place.Finally the mandatory happy end kept on the saner side of kitsch, which is already a lot to ask nowadays. So yea, this movie is definitely worth a watch.",7,0,1,7 December 2013
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," This is how 'hilarious' is spelled.
","I have to admit this is probably the best satire/homage i've ever seen. Treating your source material with so much respect while at the same time taking the crap out of it is just amazing.If you have seen 'Braindead' or 'Sean of the Dead' you might have a clue of what is lurking in this one. This movie is basically what 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is all about seen from a hillbilly point of view: A big misunderstanding. And what of a kind! The way the story unfolds is drawing in anybody with a hearth beat and the two main protagonists are just so lovable in their clumsiness its pretty impossible to not fever with them.I seriously doubted any comedy nowadays could make me laugh for something close to 90 minutes through. This one did. There are so many unforgettable scenes, that i keep wondering how Hollywood could come up with movies bare of any at all! The story might drop of a little at the end, but it's dropping of from a height normal flicks can barely dream of.Seriously, if you have just a glimpse of a heart for cheap gore movies, this one will touch all your sensitive spots, you'll giggle with excitement! Go get it right now.",10,2,5,13 May 2011
Cars," Much too shallow for what i expect of Pixar.
","Don't judge this by the standards of a Toy Story or Monsters. It barely reaches out for that. But even by normal movie standards it's a standard animation movie at best.This time Pixar borrowed a lot from various sources and didn't pack it with enough own ideas. Did you see 'Doc Hollywood'? Yes? Then you already know the story.On the other side i had the feeling i was never meant to be the target audience of this flick. Too cute, too lovely, barely any mature ideas in there. Even the romance plot looks like written for twelve-year-old's. In contrast all the previous Pixars felt much more up for entertaining adults as well.On the base of that the whole moral aspect of the movie looks much more unnecessary. I'm used to Disney shoving their morals into my face, Pixar usually delivered them in a more classy way. This time subtlety went overboard from start.All in all, worst Pixar ever, but then again, it's up against great competition, so no big deal.",5,1,2,1 December 2009
Avengers: Infinity War," Okay for Non-Fans.
","If you're a superhero-fan, you don't need a review, you will have seen this anyways. For people without this disposition, Infinity Wars is a harder sell.Best working are the characters. Even though there is an army of support characters, not one feels really cheap and unnecessary. It's a party and as such it feels a little claustrophobic sometimes, but it's still fun.The story though is a superhero-quagmire. Especially after about half of the movie logic went fully overboard and the plot happens via incomprehensible superhero actions. Time is irrelevant, distances are extremely liquid and neither the MacGuffin nor the relationships of the different 'superhero abilities' is ever satisfyingly explained. As such drama happens predomantly in the faces of the actors. Visual fidelity distracts from all questions starting with 'why'. It's like you're watching a sport you don't know the rules of - Who is winning? Why was that action helpful? Why is everyone cheering?If you're new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don't start here. The movie strongly presents itself as a chapter of an epic, so you're expected to have a certain idea of the characters to begin with and you won't see real closure unless you plan to visit the next Avenger iteration. And to be honest, i'm not sure this episode warrants the investment, as i had little enthusiasm or emotions for the protagonists and was left observing the spectacle. The humor and the actors save it from becoming another Transformer, but i never felt really engaged.",6,1,3,26 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great, if you love cinematography and the 60ies.
","This is a time piece and a love letter to Hollywood. And if you gonna see this movie, please keep this in mind. It's film-making in the mind of Sergio Leone: Long stretches of atmosphere-building. Tarantino really lets the camera rest on his motives.And it works great, as the set design is outstanding. If you like the 60ies, this movie will feel like a time travel. The first scene showing the boulevard through Hollywood was breathtaking. The love for detail shines through everything. It was the moment where i knew i will buy the Blueray the moment it comes out. The atmosphere and the lifestyle is captured brilliantly.With all this, the story sure takes a step back. I'm okay with that, as what we're presented with is amazing. But then again, if you expected Pulb Fiction 2, you'll be majorily disappointed. This is a movie-lover's movie.",9,13,21,19 August 2019
2012," A disastrous disaster movie.
","In cost to crappiness ratio, this flick ranks very, very high. I didn't expect much of a Roland Emmerich movie in terms of story or character depiction. But this is just ludicrous, even for his standards. This movie only lives of its visuals, why did he bother to include any story at all?! The worst is, that the characters are pretty much recycled from 'The day after tomorrow' with only minor changes. The different nations are portrait in a horribly stereotypical and clichéd way you'd only expect an American director to do. And the dialogs... Oh god, the dialogs! My favorite was the quote of the chief of staff of the white house criticizing the climate expert with 'Do you want to responsible for the extinction of humanity? Can you live with this?!' That line was either a genius easter egg of the writers or simply the irony of bad writing. We'll never know.If you can bear your intelligence being insulted like this, go and watch it. The effects are amazing. Just don't expect anything else.",3,3,4,4 April 2010
Ex Machina," Good, but a little under my expectation.
","Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie. It's executed very well technically, the actors are great and the story as well as the drama is gripping. I loved the references, the expositions, the way the story was told.I just felt the movie a little light on the idea of artificial intelligence and the science and philosophy around it. The protagonists, though presented as highly intelligent programmers, take rather naive actions towards their problems. I wouldn't call myself anyway close to a genius, but even i could foresee with ease most of the twists of the story and what problems might arise. It wasn't all too hard to predict how the movie ends and i was hoping that the makers take a more clever approach.All in all a really good movie. Alas, when you've seen Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, the Terminator and various other movies dealing with the idea 'artificial intelligence', this movie just feels like it takes the easy approach on that topic.",7,0,1,17 December 2016
Prisoners," Hell of a movie.
","Wow. I expected a nice thriller before going to bed. And man, did i get more than i bargained for. This is a great movie.It starts very atmospheric, but straight like any other well made abduction movie. Thanks to the great direction and the work of the amazing cast it doesn't drop. No, instead the movie takes one turn after the next, as the families glide into desperation and the policeman doubts each and everyone. The drama is very believable and kept me on the edge through all to 2.5 hours it lasted.In the end i was puzzled scratching my chair begging the movie to solve the intriguing mystery it had built up. And it did. Simply an amazing piece of movie-making.",9,0,0,21 November 2016
War Machine," I liked it.
","It's obviously a satire, but against a horrific background. And it's a slow movie, which seems to be not what most people expected. Also Brad Pitt's performance is questionable, as he plays the general a little too cartoonish for a movie that already starts off with a lot of bizarre and cynical situations.The whole movie is a nice allegory on how the 'yes we can' turned into 'what's taking so long', when it comes to the recent U.S. wars. How American idealism collides with the fact that their presence is less glorious WW2 heroism but depressing management of an asymmetric enemy. They are not here to win the war, but to administrate it. And bureaucracy doesn't sell on CNN.Nothing in this movie ever happened anywhere close to how it's presented, but the over-stylized satire and drama seems to capture the abstruseness of the situation better than a real drama could. I personally enjoyed it.",7,6,11,29 May 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I can't jump on either side. I just think it's a nice movie.
","It's a nice movie. That's all i can say it was for me.I see two kinds of reviewers here. One side sees this movie as a masterpiece, the other side expected a masterpiece and got underwhelmed. I seem to stand somewhere in between...The performance of the actors is astonishing. Winslet is great, but that's no surprise. Carey on the other hand was blowing me away with his subtle approach... i did not see that coming from a guy that was 'the mask'.It is sure a beautiful movie, but i think a part of the attraction to it is that it is not a typical Hollywood movie. It is free from any romantic clichés that usually get served to us when two famous actors play the 'fall in love'-thing. The movie unfolds mixing a Hollywood-unknown realism with a Hollywood-unknown surrealism. It's like having a joint: if you expect to be blown away, then nothing will happen. But if you relax and let it get to you, then you might enjoy it.Still: The movie obviously hasn't had the same effect that it had on most other people. It reminded me a little to my first relationship (with a different ending). But maybe that's what it's supposed to be. A sorta teenage-style 'first love' story told with mid-30ies people. It feels like a nostalgic picture of my idea of love when i was about 16, but stuffed with people of my age, so i can easier relate. To me that just doesn't feel honest. I did not think i'd ever say that, but i feel pretty grown up after watching this.Pretty much everybody in one way or the other doesn't want to grow up. If love is the thing where you don't want to mature in (or just how it was when you weren't), then take a look at this one. I couldn't get the hang of the naivety of the protagonists.",6,1,4,9 November 2008
Rio," It's okay. Not more.
","A fun movie for the whole family. Just don't expect anything similar to the epic emotional drama that was the first 'Ice Age'. The whole movie goes lightly its way without ever really challenging its protagonists. People might say 'come on, this is a kid's movie'. Those people i would again refer to Ice Age.This movie rather draws a strict black/white scheme. Good guys against bad guys. Great for kids and probably their parents. If you longing for some good character portrait though, a story with surprises, humor outside of an afternoon-sitcom-level and maybe just a little bit of drama you're left all alone in the jungle. This is basically a Disney movie, sticking to that proved formula far to close to let some creativity in.The sad fact is that by now 3D-animated movies have gone the same way as traditional cell-shading did in the 80ies. While few companies like Pixar still maintain an amazing level of storytelling within the medium, most animation studios refrain from complex and hence risky screenplays. The result are mediocre, but fun movies like this one.If you want to see what nowadays can be done with traditional animation, you'll have to turn to Japan. Western studios have lost the magic.",6,1,2,23 September 2011
Jurassic Park," A masterpiece by a master craftsman.
","I watched this movie back then in the cinema and now that i watch it again, i just can marvel at the craftsmanship that Steven Spielberg possesses. Anyone could have made a dinosaur movie and a lot have tried. But making the best dinosaur movie while setting new technical standards is only possible to the best.The story is solid, the character arcs are well-rounded, the various concepts are portrayed sufficiently authentic and the world is believable. It's the right amount of scary, the right amount of funny and the right amount of action-loaded. Of course the dinosaurs are the real stars of the movie, but it's also great to see how the interpersonal relationships develop between the various protagonists, which validates their subsequent actions throughout the movie. When you're portraying such a surreal concept as recreating extinct species, you need the transfer a lot of information from the silver screen to the audience and the seeming ease with which Spielberg accomplishes that is just astounding. Making learning about DNA, chaos theory and paleontology in a monster action movie not boring? That's a task most directors would fail miserably. Having the perfect cast for the job helps a lot too. Watching Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough argue about the consequences of playing god is just pure movie bliss. The fact that the special effects still hold up is just the cherry on top. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed one of the most influential movies of the 90ies. Spielberg deserves every academy award he won.",9,1,2,24 February 2017
