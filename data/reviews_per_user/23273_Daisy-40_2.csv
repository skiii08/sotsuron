The Blair Witch Project," It made me sick
",It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I went with about 15 other people to see this movie and not one of us liked the movie.  I'm really starting to wonder if we went and saw the same movie as everyone else did.  It was suppose to be one of the scariest movies ever.  Not once in that movie did I get a little bit freaked.  I couldn't even watch the movie after a while because of the moving of the camera back and forth made me sick.  So my advice to you is wait until this movie comes out on video.,Null,1,3,23 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," WOW!!!
",I loved this movie.  It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The acting was great the story line was great.  And the ending was so awesome. It is so worth the money of seeing this film.  I couldn't sleep at all that night becasue I kept thinking I heard people.  My advice go see the movie.,10,0,0,23 August 1999
