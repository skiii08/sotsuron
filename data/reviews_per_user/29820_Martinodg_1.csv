The Avengers," Most disappointing of the Marvels
","Of all the newest Marvel films, this is the one i wars most disappointed off! Nothing about is is good, Only Downey Jr. As iron-man is doing Well, and does what he Can not be boring A's they others. The First time wee See hulk, hes angry on every one, and the the second Time hes Only After the bad guys for some reason!? It doesn't make any sense at All! :-( One off the biggest failure In all off the superhero-genre. And why the HELL is captain America bigger than Iron-man In some scenes and on the main poster for the Movie? And then, the Movie is so confusing and unrealistic... I really don't hope the next one is coming any soon! But If it is, josh wheedon have to stay away and give space for Matthew Vaughn!",4,5,15,12 June 2012
