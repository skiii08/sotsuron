The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The movie was generally good
","Most people say the The hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 was dull and boring with no action. I totally disagree. Without being a huge fan of the hunger games series I would say that the film was really good. The first two films were so action-packed and everyone loved them . This one has a deeper meaning which is really interesting. Also there is a very interesting mystery with Peeta and the movie keeps you in front of your screen waiting to see what happened to him. Furthermore it wasn't so action-packed because it is the start of a revolution that will change everything and everyone must to clear some things out to understand what will happen in the next and last film. My only complain it was that they (producers, director etc) could put more action in the film and I know they could cause I have read the books.",8,1,12,12 March 2015
