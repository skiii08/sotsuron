Men in Black 3," A Time Tale of Two undercover agents!
","A drag into the plot had proved sufficient enough to hold the nerve of the audience. Creepiness in the very beginning of the film strikes the gist of the film, provided for the nutty girls screaming next to me during the time of the show!Its a Will Smith show! Low and behold one can easily get the humor in his character and the timing of the jokes and manipulation of his character was good. This third installment is a sort of 'Struck with luck when Stuck in work' kind of thing for him indeed. Josh Borlin and Tommy Lee Jones, two look-alike,act-alike,speak-alike personalities did add the essence and fragrance. Compared to the second installment, decade ago, the obscure plot was slightly smudging the transparency of the full length film. Provided the action and comedy clubbed together one can feel at ease and jot down 'it was fun while it lasted'.The break in the space-time continuum, the crazy nemesis Boris and his arm, an agent K, with boyish looks- grab you to a new step from the normal mode of fabrication of the MIB series. Despite of a few goofs, the film is good enough to be a day's replenishing errand. its a vision treat. Nevertheless this could be your light- hearted unforgettable weekend",8,0,4,13 June 2012
