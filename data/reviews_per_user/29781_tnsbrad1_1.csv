Walk the Line," Good movie but didn't meet my expectations
",I thought the performance of both leads was great. They played their parts with great emotion and stride. I went to see this movie because I am a Johnny Cash fan and was hoping to get a strong sense of his career from start to finish. However it didn't do that for me at all. This movie did get into some significant events of his childhood but it turned out to be too much of a love and drug story that at times dragged on way too long for me. When their was music it sounded great and some of the other great musicians of that era added a nice touch to this movie. Maybe its because Ray was so good last year that I was hoping this would rival that movie. However it did not.,6,3,12,18 November 2005
