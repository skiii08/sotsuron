The Finest Hours," A Very Nice Amazing Sea Disaster!
","Craig Gillespie did his best. The story line is gripping and makes you feel the danger and emotional turmoil each character is going through, very intricately. The film starts on a very romantic, slow pace and gains momentum as the entire East coast is hit by a snow storm. What stays in your head is everything you are watching on screen - a true account of the 1952 United States Coast Guard rescue of the SS Pendleton, after it split apart during a nor'easter off the New England coast.Leaving the few stretched on ground moments, the entire film is a nature versus man thriller, where courage wins over all odds. Go for this one if you loved the 'The Perfect Storm' and 'Titanic' etc, this one will take you back on that dreaded journey to the sea. As Miriam puts it in the film, 'It's not the water that scares me but what lies beneath it.'My Rating for this great movie is 4/5.",Null,1,7,6 February 2016
Airlift," I knew it, that just Akshay can do this role brilliantly
","Just a few hours ago i watched this movie in Cinema at Karachi. 1st of all i am very disappointed that in Pakistan people mostly watch Indian movies, but if any movie from India is somehow patriotic then these Pakistani cinemas cut the scenes from movies.And let me say that this movie is very great example of being a human. You should always think about the people, whether they are from your nation or from other. I rate it 4.5/5. Background Music is very good, songs are nice. Scenes and camera work is good. Acting of whole cast is Awesome. Well-done!We want more movies like this, simple and sensational.",Null,0,0,3 February 2016
A Star Is Born," If this movie goes for Oscar..
","If this movie goes for 8 Oscars then it means that OSCARS is a paid award ceremony nothing else. There are a lot of amazing movies waiting for people to know about them but these people have all the power to go for maximum cinemas, maximum awards and everything.It's a good movie but not worth Oscar",Null,0,0,7 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rami did an amazing job.
","Acting stuns you, amazing work by all of the actors. I have enjoyed it, and I think you can too. If you like biographies then you must watch this movie. But there is nothing so much great about the story of this movie as it's a biography so don't expect more. Just enjoy it!",Null,2,2,4 February 2019

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," What a movie, Stunning...!!
","An amazing movie. Everyone knows the story of M S Dhoni and what he has achieved for India in cricket. But this film is more about how he started liking the game and pursued it as a career. The story is all about his struggles of getting selected into the Indian team and what all troubles he faced in becoming a star and won us the prestigious 2011 cricket world cup.Sushanth Singh Rajput is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. He performs so well that you will feel as if Dhoni himself has acted in his biopic. The way Sushanth has mastered the cricketing skills and imitated Dhoni completely in the game is just outstanding. Not only with the appearance, Sushanth gives an emotional performance and holds you onto the screen right until the end.Special mention should go to the VFX team for showcasing the grounds, cricket matches, and Sushanth in such a splendid way. The Ending of the movie surely give you goosebumps. AmazingM S Dhoni is one name which will be remembered in India for the rest of our lives. His rise to fame and the actual struggles he faced to get where he is now is an inspiration in itself.",Null,0,0,26 October 2016

Schindler's List," I have never seen a movie like this one
","I have seen thousands of movies, happy ones, sad ones, war movies, but I've never seen a movie like this one. I have cried a lot, how can any human can do this type of cruelty. One of the Best moment of my life when I watched this movie in a cold night and I wept a lot!",Null,1,4,23 December 2018
Sultan," Story is so predictable, even kids were telling the upcoming scenes
","They always advertise movies like there is a new one coming out but mostly those most advertised movies are same. For Stars like Salman khan it is their absolute duty to entertain people with a great movie, but for that you must go with a great story.If you are a die-hard fan of Salman Khan then you will fight with those who say that this movie was ridiculous and rubbish. But most of people wants to watch a great story with the great acting. For me its an average movie, just one time watch.Now come to the music and background soundtrack of movie. There is no good song in the movie, background track is like they stole a lot from most of well-known Hollywood movies.No emotions in the movie, because the editing, background music and dialogues are not up to date.I give 3 out of 5 because some of actors did their best. I just watched it for Randeep Hooda because Salman acting is same as always.",Null,3,10,9 July 2016

Inception," One of the BEST

The Shawshank Redemption," A Best Story
","This movie is a must watch movie. I bet everyone loved this movie for sure. Acting is superb.The Shawshank Redemption' is a movie about time, patience and loyalty not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The Shawshank Redemption' is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",Null,0,1,21 July 2015
