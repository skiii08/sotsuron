The Avengers," In the end, Stark went for it
","Till now, The Avengers is the most spectacular motion picture of 2012. I doubt that there is any other film can beat that. The soundtrack is beautiful. The acting is well-done. The directingÂ… oh my, is marvelous! I know Joss Whedon is good at doing 'teamwork' films like Firefly, Serenity, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, etc. but I was stunned when seeing The Avengers.Damn, he's that good! Containing a group of superheroes in one live action feature film is an amazing idea, but make it work is a whole different thing. And Joss Whedon just did that radiantly. I am also keeping an eye on Zak Penn, who wrote the script of The Avengers. He had done an excellent job there.Well, I do realize that most of reviews on IMDb have already talked about how wonderful this movie is. And I admit that I am not as good as other viewers at this point. So I just talk about one thing really got me in this movie. Above all those magnificent details about the soundtrack, the script, the visual experience, etc. one thing is very small and even not in the league of those really got me: Tony Stark went for it.What did he go for? I won't tell you, see it yourself. What Tony did in The Avengers had brought back the Stark I knew in Iron Man (2008). And for me, Tony Stark is the most admirable character in this film. Well firstly, I like Loki. I still like him, just love Tony more. Can't wait to see him in Iron Man 3, which directed by Shane Black (he did Kiss Kiss Bang Bang).Long story short, ladies and gentlemen, go watch The Avengers. It's worth your time. People start to compare this film with The Dark Knight Rises. Come on, guys. Don't ruin the moment. Not everything needs to be compared. The Avengers is wonderful motion picture, so does The Dark Knight Rises may be. That's it. Accept it.",8,3,8,29 April 2012
