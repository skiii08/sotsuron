Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Overrated
","Honestly, I have watched this film three times and yet to figure out why people seem to think it is 'funny'. IT'S NOT. The first time watching it, I just watched it, and I laughed twice, during the entire film. I went to Borat hoping to see some of the humor and craziness I saw with Ali G. Denied. So the second time I saw this movie (a friend wanted to see it), I really really tried to open my mind to the 'humor'. But again, denied. The third time was out of spite rather than desire.Its a slow, uncomfortable, unfunny movie. People will say that uncomfortable is what makes it funny. No. Its the bad kind of uncomfortable.And to anyone who compares this film to Monty Python put down the crack pipe because its killed your ability to reason.",2,4,9,21 February 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Somewhat of a letdown
","I love the show and did not go into the movie thinking it was going to be something wildly spectacular, just a longer and funnier episode . . . . like watching a couple of episodes in a row. Yet I was let down at several levels. First they took no time to give us any additional character development on some of the more reoccurring characters. Amlost devoid of Burns, that was a major problem. More importantly they broke their own canon by not having Ranier Wolfcastle be the Pres vice Arnold (as Wolfcastle is a parody of the A Man). Sadly I laughed only 4 times during the film, which is less than an average episode. Homer got it right at the beginning of the film. We were SUCKERS.",5,1,4,5 August 2007
