Requiem for a Dream," Waste of 102 minutes
","I have seen many horror films, films about drug addiction...etc. This was by far the worst I have ever seen. I would not recommend this to anyone. It is so incredibly depressing as you see these people become lunatics in their quest for the next high. Yeah, the cinematography was neat but that cannot carry a movie. The shrieking violin of the background music overpowered every scene, especially during the climax which was not even climactic. I think this was a rather cliched look into drug addiction. The only thing this movie would be good for would be to show it to wannabe junkies.",7,0,1,27 August 2001
