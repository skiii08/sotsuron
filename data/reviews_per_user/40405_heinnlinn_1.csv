Source Code," A surprisingly entertaining thriller
","I didn't really have high expectations from this film, as the trailer seemed to have given the plot away. But I was surprised how much I have enjoyed it.As the character tries to find out the missing pieces of the jigsaw, I found myself glued to the seat, sometimes even forgetting to blink. The repeating 8 minutes which the character has to relive again and again bothered me at the first, but it helped me to understand the frustration of the character even more.Jake did a brilliant job portraying Captain Stevens, while the others, including the beautiful Michelle Monaghan, were believable and understandable. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Vera Farmiga (Goodwin).The plot was easy enough to follow, although there were twists one hasn't anticipated. The ending was beautiful and it left us wondering and thinking about the story again. The idea of alternate realities has been seen in a lot of films lately, but it still hasn't become boring for me. I might buy this on DVD when it comes out and watch it again, this time trying to find answers to the questions that were never asked.",8,0,1,5 July 2011
