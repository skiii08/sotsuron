The Blair Witch Project," Terrifying to anyone with an imagination.
","Dull wits or those of the 'slower set' will not appreciate this movie. They will hem and haw about the bad camera work and lack of plot, when in reality these things are the true genius of this film.Watching this movie is like reading a book, where you have to use your imagination to 'see' what is going on. The better your imagination, the more terrifying this movie is.If you don't 'get it' it's a shame, as this movie can and will scare the living hell out of you.",Null,0,1,1 November 2002
