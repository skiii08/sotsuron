Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Timeless Classic
","I have been on IMDB for many years now, but I have decided to do my first film review on the greatest film of all time. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a great adventure, romance, and 80's film that has remained an icon ever since its initial release. Harrison Ford does it again, first with Han Solo, and now with Indiana Jones. His charismatic presence and tough charm solidify him as a relatable yet spectacular hero that you cant help but fall in love with. The score and soundtrack are also breathtaking, putting you right next to Indy on his many wild adventures for holy and ancient artifacts. You will find yourself smiling, gasping, and cheering by the end of this spectacular journey that is nearly the beginning.",10,1,2,16 May 2018
