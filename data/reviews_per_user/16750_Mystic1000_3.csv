Blade Runner 2049," Grandiloquent - not in a good way
","If you haven't seen the original then you will be lost and confused for two and half hours. I saw the original recently and I re-liked it a lot, but I'm not a sci-fi aficionado with a great and caring eye like many people are. Anyway, I knew the story and where 2049 was coming from. The cinematography and CGI are impressive all the way through and no doubt Oscar worthy. Gosling and Ford are great together, and Sylvia Hoeks is a revelation and worth the price of admission alone. So what's not to like? It's boring and the story is so convoluted you'll have to sit through it twice to figure things out. How did K find Ana, for instance? OK, maybe I fell asleep and missed that detail. I'm sure its a matter of taste. The only Villanueve movie I ever really liked was Sicario, so maybe that tells you something why I found BladeRunner 2049 overwrought and overblown.",5,2,5,16 October 2017
Passengers," Not a Ten for one big reason
","Look, if you're a SciFi fan you have to suspend some belief. That's the rules. So the reviews that say this movie doesn't reflect reality are playing some weird double standard. I bet they loved Roque One or Star Trek, which are about as far fetched as you can go. Anyway, moving on... I loved the premise of this movie and appreciated the way the story line looked at some very human dilemmas around home, relationship, life and death. A lot of movies don't come close to the philosophical questions Passengers laid out, and the acting is superb. One big problem for me was the schmaltzy Hollywood ending. They took the 'return to life' scene too far and THAT is where it lost any credibility. Then it skated to that Hollywood close that left a bit of vomit in my mouth. I can think of at least three endings that would have been more poignant and more in sync with the depth of the earlier messaging. Missed opportunity probably due to some suits that wanted more explosions and a Happy Ever After.",8,3,7,4 January 2017
The Favourite," Call This What it is -- A Masterpiece
","Let me start by saying I have not been a Lanthimos fan. I watched The Lobster for 20 minutes and stopped, and didn't want to see Sacred Deer just from seeing the trailer. This film, though, perhaps because he didn't write it, which constrained some of his worst inclinations, produced something that will live for decades in the annals of truly great cinema.
Unless you are into superheros, explosions, splatter and martial arts as your only movie fare; and if you appreciate cinematic art in its many expressions (acting, music, plot, layered symbolism, cinematography, direction, etc.), then this is a film that will stick with you for awhile.
Finally, I want to say a word about two things ( NOT spoilers):1) the ending that a few people seem to be dissing in thier reviews and 2) a few disparaging comments about historical accuracy.
In my viewing the ending was perfect. The Queen remains the Queen no matter who fights for or wins the place of Favourite. Winning is not what it looks to be from afar. Is who you become in getting to the pinnacle who you really want to be?
And take a look at Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough in Wikipedia, which references her letters reporting the Queen's lesbian bent. Was this out of spite? Who knows, but it's there. One of the only artistic licenses on historical fact that I could find was the tea and horse incident, which served to further the intensity of the drama.
Go see this movie as soon as you can. It's going to have some serious attention in award season.",10,81,162,4 December 2018
