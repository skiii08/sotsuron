Requiem for a Dream," Good, but gross
","Fair warning: I saw this film and had to leave a couple minutes before the end because of the way the music kept building up along with the quick cuts of several truly disgusting scenes. If I didn't leave, I may have yakked right there.The film is a little too good at accomplishing its goals.",Null,0,0,20 October 2000
