The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An amazing film; wonderful cast chemistry
","I just finished this film. It was pretty damn amazing. The chemistry between the characters and cast members is palpable; it's so, so easy to believe that they are friends and that they've built a wonderful relationship among one another.Charlie's character and story continually, in turn, broke my heart, made me smile, and surprised me. Actually, the stories of the central three characters all surprised and delighted me because the movie wasn't about their problems or their pasts. The movie was really about the characters, their lives and their relationships. They came with experiences and pasts that were powerfully influential, but that wasn't what the movie was about.A wonderful aspect of the movie was how much it focused on their friendships, without ignoring their families. That focus on their friendships worked well with this movie, unlike most, because it made me remember what it was like, friendships were THE most important part of my life, possibly the only important part. I think that's an experience many teenagers feel in the Western world. Perhaps it worked because the movie integrated their families into the story, like how a teen's family is there and important, but we aren't always aware of them.I highly recommend this film. The directing was fantastic, all of the actors did an amazing job, and I think many lines of dialogue and scenes will stay with me for a long time.",9,0,1,2 March 2013
