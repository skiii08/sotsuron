United 93," Powerfully Done and Excellent Film-making
","One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. This almost qualifies as a documentary for it's portrayal of what happened to United 93 on September 11, 2001. No politics, no pointing fingers at any person or organization, just what happened that day.I felt as if I was back there on that day. You can not help but become drawn into the film and it has an emotional impact.Hollywood needs to take note - this is how to make a powerful movie about a historical event. No one really cares about your political take on an event - draw us into the event, make us feel we are there and you will have a blockbuster.Well worth the money to see in a theater - which I haven't said about a movie in about 2 years.",10,3,7,30 April 2006
