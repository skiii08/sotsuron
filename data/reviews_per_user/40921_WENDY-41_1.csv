The Blair Witch Project," dizzy heights and sick american people
","i didn't know what to expect from this movie. aight, maybe all that piled up hype and the fact that practically almost every college kid in the city is awed by this little movie.what can i say, i almost vomited after the tenth minute.first of all, the genre couldn't cut it. this is the kind of supposedly-indie movie that makes me glad for Disney's Inspector Gadget. i'd very much rather watch a spiffy, special FX movie with a generic horror movie storyline than a wobbly, supposedly 'indie' movie with a generic horror movie storyline.secondly, well, i dont know if people still pay attention to realism or whatchamacallitnowadays, but realism seems amiss in this movie. first off, the batteries. nuf said. second, Heather's well-done hair: no wonder they couldnt get out of the woods! it looks like it takes her a few hours to get her braid done! third, the REAL things REAL people should have done at that situation, i.e. 'if i were in that situation i would [a.) burn the woods so people would notice the fire b.) climb a tree so i can find where we're going or c.) run like hell cus my fren's dead and I MIGHT BE DEAD SOON!].oh yeah, and they broke every rule of hiking, i.e. orient everyone as to where yr going; bring copies of the map; bring additional compasses; and bring enough cigarettes.and of course, the SEXISM. witch? a witch aint that dumb. everything the killer did was dumb and very much uncalculated. a witch could do better thank you. and Heather? lured two boys into the woods and got them killed; wouldn't admit that she's wrong, wouldn't give the boy the map; perpetrated their own death; gave the wrong directions; and last person to be killed. heck, Eve gave Adam the apple didnt she?and yeah, i really am not keen on this uberglorifying of perverted people coming off as supernatural. serial killers are NOTuniversal, trust me.finally: Hansel and Gretel anyone?",Null,0,0,4 October 1999
