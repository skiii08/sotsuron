The Equalizer," i do rather stare at a blank screen
","I decided to watch this movie because the trailer and high rating in IMDb.Starting is nice, seems promising, impressive, and I thought I gonna WOW thru the movie.However, NO... I just don't know why the 'action' become so boring, instead of eyes blobbing out and WOW, I go like 'oh OK, so? what next? oh? really? OK, next?'Watching this movie is like eating a pretty on the outside but stale inside cake.Unless you really have nothing to do at all, then... do watch...For me, I do rather sleep than watch this. Since I have already watch it, I can't turn back time and unwatched, aye? So, here I'm writing this.",1,8,15,23 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Fart Awakens and it sucks
","I was expecting something with more OOMPHH than Darth Vader times, the Original trilogy. But what i get after a long 2+hours is totally frustration. It's just a reboot of A New Hope, and the best(worst) part is, this 2 totally new force user can almost instantly use their new found power like someone who has been practicing for years. Wow! 1st timer can mind control, 1st timer can swing the sword and defeat a Darth Vader wannabe? wow! COOL (yeah right, so NOT cool that is)And the all new bad guy Darth Vader wannabe whose name I don't even feel worthy of mentioning, is like a what? spoiled kid who just smashes up everything around when he can't get what he wants... gosh... and this kind of character is a leader material? is a bad guy that people fear? *spit spit spit*If this is your 1st time watching Star Wars, yeah, it's kinda enjoyable. but for old school, I think we have just wasted time and money to learn that this force awaken is just the same as A New Hope 1977. Do the maths, after almost 40 years! from an era with lousy computer to an era where a computer is just the size of our palm and yet, I don't see any significant improvements in Star Wars.My advice would be: just get a copy of the Originals Trilogy, stay home and watch them over and over and over again... You can't goes wrong with this choice. Chances are, for episode 8 and 9, we will have the same disappointment. They think they can control our mind but sorry~ your mind trick doesn't work...",1,130,169,6 January 2016
