The Blair Witch Project," Good movie, but...
","Not a masterpiece and not the best horror movie ever, but I still added it to my top ten list.  I really liked it, it was nice to get away from the teen slasher flicks we have been seeing more and more of lately.  This movie did scare me and it really played with my imagination.  Just like in the original Haunting, you don't see a single ghost or monster and isn't that what made The Haunting so scary?  That is what makes this movie scary, you let your imagination do the work when you hear what the young film makers are hearing.  I have to admit, people are walking into the movie expecting to see a masterpiece of horror and they walk out thinking that they wasted their time.  This movie is a 'either you liked it or hated it' flick and you are going to hear both sides argue over this issue.  You just have to go and see it for yourself and make up your mind.",10,1,2,27 July 1999
