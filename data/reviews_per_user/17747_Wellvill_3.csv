The Blair Witch Project," the ultimate horror film
","Got to see the prelim release of this at the Mayan theater in Denver on Friday night, and it became apparent to me that so many people missed the point of the movie by the number of people who were booing at the end.  It seems so many people have to see a monster or have something jump out of the darkness to think a horror movie is good.  If you're going with that idea in mind, you will be sorely disappointed.  This isn't the kind of movie that really scares you when you watch it, but comes back to haunt you the next time you find yourself alone in the dark.  Instead of showing a monster, you spend the whole movie imagining what it could be, and that constant imagining will stay with you long after you see it, scaring you each time you try to ponder what it might have been.  I can honestly say that with the notable exception of 'Seven', this is the only horror movie that's ever managed to scare me out of my mind...",Null,1,2,18 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," FOLLOW THE CHARACTERS!!!
","I've read every submitted review about this movie, and it seems the biggest quarrel everyone has is with the plot, the script, and the monologue near the end... I'm writing this in defense of all three, and hopefully giving everyone some tips on watching this cinematic masterpiece.DO NOT go into this movie thinking you can watch it passively.  It's about as complex as Cris Carter's alien conspiracy from the X-Files.  It may be as brilliant and stunning as Burton's previous movies (of which I DO include Mars Attacks, which I loved), but the line between good and evil isn't as clear-cut and it doesn't have the 'get the bad guy' plot of his two installments of Batman.  If you quickly forget faces and names, you will get lost with 'Sleepy Hollow' and may need the near-the-end monologue to rescue you.  If, however, you closely follow the characters and start ACTIVELY watching by trying to piece together the puzzle from the given clues, the monologue takes on a different purpose.  Listen closely to the early dialogues between Ricci and Depp about the townspeople, then watch for the similarities between Depp's flashback scenes and pieces of Ricci's childhood, and the reasoning behind the Horseman's killings should be obvious.  Then comes the monologue... and it will rip to pieces everything you were thinking.  This is sheer brilliance.  This is something of which few writers are capable.  This is the stuff of which Tim Burton movies are made.  This turnaround is what makes movies like 'Sixth Sense', 'Diabolique' and 'Se7en' so good.  However, where those movies turned things around visually, 'Sleepy Hollow' does it verbally, showing you that while Burton may have some visually stunning effects and sets, he doesn't rely on them to move the movie along.  The monologue turns the movie from what could be a tidy little Hollywood storyline into the realm of the downright twisted.So as for the reviews that dog this movie for having no plot or script, pay no attention to them.  Both elements ARE there if you're truly watching. This kind of subtelty and twisting of events is what makes for good moviemaking, and this movie is the perfect blend of excellent writing and visual effects.  But remember... FOLLOW THE CHARACTERS CLOSELY!!!  Don't forget their relation to the other characters or the story in general, and be sure to soak in EVERYTHING that is said and seen.  If you do, you'll see it is easily the best movie of the year.  10/10 stars! -Eric",10,0,0,22 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," Amazing...
","Out of all the movies I've ever seen, only two movies have had endings that managed to take me completely by surprise... those two are Diabolique and Seven.  Well, make this movie the third.  I'm not even going to hint as to what happens in respect for an amazing script, amazing performances, and a storyline that will have you believing the unbelievable without even thinking twice.  Just when nothing else this summer (or year, for that matter) looked like it was going to top Blair Witch as the best movie, along comes Sixth Sense... if you're debating going to see it, just go... it's worth the price of the ticket and will have you walking out of the theater stunned.  Unless a real miracle happens, it may be a long time before another movie is released that has quite the ending as this one.  But believe me... it's not just the ending that will have you completely captivated.  Amazingly, for a Bruce Willis movie, there are probably only two words that would be edited out if this were to be showing on tv.  Look to see this movie winning big at the Oscars, unless (like what usually happens) the academy decides it was too dark and nominates The Haunting, Scream 274 (The Geriatric Slasher), or something equally brainless and pointless...",Null,0,0,12 August 1999
