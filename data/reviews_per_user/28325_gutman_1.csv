Miracle," The academy can no longer ignore KURT RUSSELL!!!
","For one reason or another, Kurt Russell has always been THE most underrated 'a' list actor in Hollywood!  Always putting in solid, believable performances and NEVER getting recognition for them.  And every time I think he's given the best performance of his wonderful career (just see 'Dark Blue'), he turns it up one more notch and makes a movie like 'MIRACLE.'It's nice to know that Kurt Russell, now well into his 50's, still has his best work ahead of him!! At a time when most people are 'throwing in the towel' and enjoying the down slope of life, Kurt's just getting started.Don't see this movie 'cause you like hockey, don't see this movie 'cause you like the U.S.A., see it because Kurt Russell is one of the greatest actors of all time and he can no longer be ignored!!Ladies and gentlemen, Kurt Russell . . . .
