Come and See," Suddenly I've changed my mind, f**k wars man!
","Don't hesitate! this film is amazing, After so many World War 2 movies i thought 'Come and See' would be like the rest, boy was I dead wrong! There is an eerie feel throughout the movie, i found it very haunting. It quickly became one of my favorite foreign movies. Overall my favorite scene was that of Florya and Glasha in the Forrest from their weird cry/laugh to their dancing in the rain, it all seemed so surreal. These two kids in the middle of War. Another thing I admire about Klimov's 'come and see' is that the movie is not about a victory, but one of a Belorussian village being burnt to the ground. Overall, Florya went through more than he had bargained for, hopefully one day he saw and end to that hell.",10,2,2,1 August 2010
