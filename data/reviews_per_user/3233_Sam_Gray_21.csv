The Blair Witch Project," a terrible film on several levels (sort of a spoiler, maybe)
","I fail to understand the hype that surrounded this film when it was realized.  It's innovative in that no one has ever done a film like it, true, but that doesn't mean this innovation was a good idea.First, the idea that people thought the film was real disturbs me.  The fact that the end of the movie is immediately followed by the words 'Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez' should indicate that the story is fictitious.  And the film isn't even realistic anyway, not if you think about it.Case in point - I have heard the movie called a 'psychological masterpiece' even though it is psychologically ridiculous.  Even though the characters are obviously in terrible danger, they continue to film what's happening to them.  One character thinly justifies this by saying that the camera filters reality and makes the situation seem less serious.  I don't buy that, especially not towards the end of the film when the characters know without doubt that something is out to get them.  The fact of the matter is that any real person probably would not only cease filming, but drop the camera all together and run.A further flaw of the film is its terrible dialogue and relative lack of characterization.  This problem is likely a function of the fact that the directors sent the actors out into the woods alone and allowed them to 'improvise.'  The end result is three one-sided characters that each possess only a single personality trait (for example, Heather is, shall we say, assertive - and nothing else).  Thus, the content of the dialogue amounts to: 'Goodness, this is weird.  Where's the car?'  Just add some cuss words. Oh, yeah, and someone 'kicks' a map.What's worse is that the movie is anti-climatic.  Oh, it tries to climax, it just doesn't.  After about ninety or so minutes the film just sort of ends. And the scary part is supposed to be the unseen.  Whatever.  Maybe in some other movie.I'd give the Blair Witch Project a 2/10, but only because it at least isn't a cliche.  If you really want a good psychological horror, pick up the original Psycho instead.",2,0,2,3 February 2000
Erin Brockovich," I would never have expected this to be a good movie
","I remember thinking, from the first time I saw the trailer for this movie in theaters, that there would be no way that it could ever be a movie worth watching.  For one thing, I've never been that impressed by Julia Roberts. In addition, the trailer made her look like she'd be playing a stereotype - a one-dimensional talk-to-my-hand-while-you-look-at-my-breasts type of character.  But, most importantly, I was certain that there was no way, under the constant and unalterable laws that hold our universe together, that I would ever be able to sit through a film that associates itself with that accursed 'Everyday is a winding road' song.I guess I can't always be right.I went to see Erin Brockovich because several people whose opinions I value promised me that it was actually good.  Even then, I was skeptical, but I found this to be an extraordinary film.  Far from being one-dimensional, Erin is an interesting, funny, and intelligent character and one of the best written female characters to appear in a movie in a long time.  And, I must admit, Julia Roberts really sells the performance well.  Depending on what else Hollywood has to offer this year, both Roberts and her movie may be looking at an Oscar nomination.  9/10",9,1,2,3 May 2000
Meet the Parents," Best comedy in years
","I like comedies as much as the next guy, but I think that comedy as a genre tends to produce mediocre films more often than any other genre, and even the best of comedies aren't as likely as other genres to produce a film worth more than one viewing.  It could be worse for comedy, though, as I think horror and action produce more outright bad movies than other genres.Anyway, I think the mediocre tendency in comedy has been even more prevalent then normal in the past few years, as most of the major comedies releases have been, well, average efforts in my opinion, and I'm speaking of films such as: There's Something About Mary, both the Austin Powers movies, and Analyze This.  You might notice I haven't included any of the 'teen' comedies, but that's because I consider 'teen' to be a genre onto itself. And, now that I think about it, 'teen' is even worse than horror and action because it produces almost nothing other than terrible films, particularly if teen and horror combine without the word 'scream' in the title.  Comedy's looking better all the time.But, alas, I digress.  The point of the matter is that, with Meet the Parents, I've finally found a comedy that beats this mediocre trend.  And, if you're anal about movie knowledge like I am, you're probably noticed that Meet the Parents includes, in its stars and director, people involved in each of the average films I mention above.  In fact, that bit of trivia had made me somewhat wary of seeing this film.Luckily for me, I crumbled.  Meet the Parents is not only funnier that any other strict comedy in years, but it is also smarter.  Part of my problem with a lot of comedies these days is the overuse of sight gags and toilet humor.  Not that I have a problem with either, but I feel like movies insult my intelligence when they use either too often.  Meet the Parents has its share of both, but most of the really funny stuff is verbal or situational. There's even an instance or two of choice satire near the film's end.What surprised my the most about Meet the Parents, however, is how many of the laughs come from De Niro.  He's definitely the straight man, but he's got some good lines.  He's also well cast, and he has essentially taken a lot of his more prominent roles and toned them down into an overprotective father.  At the same time, he's likeable, and that impresses me.  His is the best performance in the movie and also his best in years.True, Meet the Parents is a little over-the-top, but so what?  It's also highly entertaining, and the fact that I would willfully watch it again, knowing the jokes, says a lot for it in my book.  9/10",9,0,0,29 December 2000
Unbreakable," woefully underrated
","Even though this film has a relatively good rating as of this writing, I cannot help but feel it deserves much better.I also cannot help but notice how many people are comparing Unbreakable to The Sixth Sense, which I suppose is inevitable.  What I cannot understand is that many notice the similarity in style between the two films and levy objections - even some that enjoyed The Sixth Sense.  My question is: what did these people expect?  The fact is, many directors, especially great and memorable directors, do have distinctive styles that follow them from film to film.  Consider Hitchcock, Lean, the Coen Brothers, or, to a lesser extent, Gilliam.  All of them make films that are, in some ways, similar, and all of them make films that stand apart from each other.  The same, thus far, is true of Shyamalan.  I can only suppose he is receiving such a backlash because of his high profile, but I believe this is unfair.That said, I must admit that I was worried walking into Unbreakable specifically because I did love The Sixth Sense so much.  Indeed, The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies, but it was the first of Shyamalan's films that I had seen (though it was not his first film as many suppose). In similar situations, I have been disappointed, such as when Frank Darabont followed The Shawshank Redemption with The Green Mile and Bryan Singer followed The Usual Suspects with Apt Pupil.Shyamalan, however, manages to retain the strengths of his style while once again exploring an established genre in a totally new way.  Unbreakable is a super hero movie, but while most films of this type are pure escapism, Shyamalan infuses his movie with an interesting theme: the nature and necessity of dichotomy.  What's really great, however, is that Shyamalan not only addresses this theme through character and plot progression, but also through the visual element.Also, I must admit I love the ending.  Indeed, I believe it's the only reasonable ending relative to the theme.  For this reason, I don't know if I would even consider it to be a 'twist.'  I do think the written epilogue is unnecessary, but that is a minor objection.Furthermore, Shyamalan's able direction is aided by a great cast.  As usual, Bruce Willis makes the perfect everyman and is easy to relate to.  And I have long been a fan of Samuel L. Jackson, who generally stands out as a great performer even in his most average films (I also can't help but respect the fact that he looks different in almost all of his films, including this one).  The two play well off of each other, Willis's average guy providing the perfect counterpoint to Jackson's eccentric.  The rest of the cast is good as well, particularly Charlayne Woodard as Jackson's mother.I admit that Unbreakable's has some flaws, particularly the convenient occupation of Willis's wife and the aforementioned epilogue.  However, these flaws are greatly overpowered by the film's strengths, and thus I am more apt to forgive them then usual.I do not often give films a '10' rating.  Of the 335 films I have rated at this site thus far, this is only the thirteenth.  But, I buy movies even less often, as rental is usually enough for me, and I already plan to own Unbreakable.  It is a movie that I believe demands and deserves multiple viewings.  I have already seen it twice, and I cannot wait to add it to my small personal collection.  10/10",10,1,2,27 December 2000
Fight Club," stylish, but a hollow, perhaps even hypocritical film (spoilers)
","Let me start my saying that I do like Fight Club in the overall sense, if only for its stylish direction (on the technical side, at least) and occasional sense of humor.But there are loads of things wrong with the film, too.  While it picks a valid theme, that being the general aimlessness and cynicism of Generation X, its conclusions are uncertain and its execution is all wrong.  The entire film seems to support nihilism and self-destruction as an answer to the problem of philosophical and spiritual emptiness; in other words, the film (particularly Tyler) seems to promote embracing that emptiness.  But then, the whole movie jumps ship in the last few minutes and ends ambiguously, on the one hand seeming to suggest such nihilism is wrong (the narrator 'defeats' Tyler), but on the other hand seeming to confirm the rest of the movie (the narrator and Marla stand together and watch, with seeming contentment, as the bombs go off).  So, in the end, the movie isn't brave enough to make any real statement at all.Furthermore, if Fight Club IS criticizing materialism, than it's insanely hypocritical ('The things you own end up owning you, but please buy the DVD').  And, if one wants to criticize trendiness, as this movie again may or may not be doing, don't include a techno/industrial soundtrack.And I have to say, I have never, at least before this film, seen a movie that is degrading to both men and women.But, I have to say, reviewer Durden7 is right about one thing.  Fight Club is a movie that is generally going to draw people that are predisposed to liking it, anyway.  But, this is NOT the definitive film of this age, although it might be the definitive film of those that are satisfied being defined by film.Nevertheless, I do recommend Fight Club, at least for a rental.  I've got to admit, it is kind of cool.  Just go into it aware that you're not getting style over substance, you're getting style rather than substance. 7/10P. S. American Beauty covers a similar theme, if with an older subject, and does it better (and without going Marxist).",7,0,2,24 February 2000
Citizen Kane," just take out the first twenty minutes or so...
","And I would then say this film deserves all the praise it receives.  Being the huge film buff that I am, I decided last week that I finally needed to see this, the most important film ever made.  But, initially, I was really disappointed.  The first twenty minutes or so, with the newsreel footage and the reporters, was really jarring to me, and I even considered not watching the rest of the film (I did stop watching it until the next day).But, when Welles finally took center stage so to speak, the film became entirely riveting.  I was really impressed.  This is certainly one of the best character studies I've ever seen captured on film.  And I've never seen a movie recover so well from such a weak introduction.  Really, this would be a perfect movie if only those first twenty or so minutes weren't there. 9/10",9,0,1,1 March 2000
X-Men," Not bad, but the top 250? Surely not.
","Hmmm, I haven't been hanging around this site much lately, but I must admit some surprise at how highly this film is rated.  I mean, I thought I'd have a higher opinion of it than most people because I used to read the comic book (which probably gives me a slight prejudice on the matter).  Well, anyway, that said...X-Men is not a bad film, but man, they could have done a lot more with it. I mean, here you have a movie that's basically guaranteed a profit, yet it's only a little longer than an hour and a half.  I mean, there's not much character development here - for the most part at least; Wolverine and Rogue fans are in luck.  However, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique) has one line and Ray Park (as Toad) has two.  Couldn't they do better than that?  And Tyler Mane (Sabretooth) doesn't speak much either.  In fact, outside of Wolverine and Rogue, Professor Xavier and Magneto are the only characters with much of a personality (flat as they might be), and yet Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem underused in the parts (especially Stewart).  By the way, don't think that means there's lots of action because there isn't.Which isn't to say that I didn't like the film.  What action scenes it has are fairly good and the plot is passable enough.  There simply didn't seem to be much to X-Men.  When it ends, you feel like you've watched the first episode of a new TV series.  And you have, basically, because you can pretty safely bet they'll be at least one sequel.  7/10",7,0,0,28 July 2000
Romeo + Juliet," a retarded reinterpretation
","Sigh.  I generally dislike movies that attempt to set classics in modern times, and this is no exception.  Not only is this version of the play difficult to take seriously, it's paced badly, and most of the acting is terrible.  What Luhrmann has attempted to do is splice hyperactivity together with intellect - and the two don't mix well.  Furthermore, setting Romeo and Juliet in modern times necessarily takes the play entirely out of context, especially when using the original dialogue.  Romeo and Mercutio are particularly misrepresented here.There are only two things that keep this 'film' from getting a one or a two from me.  First, the soundtrack is cool (I'm a huge Radiohead fan).  Second, Shakespeare's writing is still genius, even in a misrepresentation like this.  But otherwise, there's little to like about this movie.  It's a blatant and gross exploitation of art for the sake of trendiness. 3/10",3,13,31,23 February 2000
U-571," U-won't believe how stupid this movie is
","*MINOR SPOILER, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT AWAY*At one point during U-571, someone gets blown from the top of a submarine, having been hit in the head by some flying debris, lands a few hundred feet away in the middle of the ocean, then is still alive to yell something at another character hundreds of feet away on another submarine, who actually hears him, in the middle of a thunderstorm, while several other things go boom in the night around them.But far be it from me to call U-571 unrealistic.  Impossible is more the word.  I would need no less than three hands to count how many times I said to myself, 'Now that was stupid,' during the course of this movie.  In fact, there was one point when the entire audience, as an aggregate, basically screamed the words 'Yeah, right!' at the screen.The funny thing is, they actually had a military advisor for this film - a vice admiral, at that.  Seems to me they couldn't have listened to him, though.  I mean, granted, I don't know the first thing about military life, but I know enough about physics to realize that starting a diesel engine while underwater is a really bad idea.True, the film could be worst.  Parts of it are somewhat suspenseful, and the acting is passable.  I wouldn't recommend you pay money to see it, though.But, if you do, know this: there's no good reason to pay attention to anyone except McConaughey, Paxton, and Keitel.  Anyone else in U-571 is important for maybe ten minutes - at best.  In addition, this movie falls into the usual war movie trap of casting a whole bunch of people that look alike. And it doesn't help that they don't mention many names.  For example, even knowing the name of Jon Bon Jovi's character from the credits, I can't place him in the film (granted, his fans will recognize him, I'm sure, but, no offense to the man, I'm not one of them).Really, though, I should have known better than to go see U-571 in the first place.  It's the type of movie that's usually rated 'R' and usually released in the summer.  So, if you think about it, the fact that it's 'PG-13' and has come out in April speaks volumes in-of-itself.  4/10",4,2,5,26 April 2000
American Beauty," Movies are almost never this good
","I have long resisted commenting on this movie because so many reviewers have compared it to Happiness, many claiming that Happiness is the better picture.  As a result, I became convinced that I needed to see Happiness before I could responsibly comment of this film.  Well, I saw Happiness this weekend, and it's no contest; American Beauty is definitely the better film (you can also read my scathing review of Happiness if you like).By the way, I'd like to note that I saw American Beauty when it first opened, so I liked it before all the hype.I'm in college now, but I grew up in the suburbs (including suburbs of Atlanta, Dallas, and Washington, D.C.).  I can promise, without hesitation, that this is the best representation of suburban life I have ever seen. True, the characters are arguably stereotypes, but they are REALISTIC stereotypes.  I can point to specific people in my past that are exactly like each of the three main teenage characters.  And, while I consider my own family to be extremely functional, I know several people who's family lives are similar to the Burnhams.But, to me, the reason American Beauty transcends other films that have addressed this subject is that it is both realistic and optimistic.  This film acknowledges the problems with suburban life, but its message is one of hope and redemption.  I don't understand why some have interpreted this film as cynical or depressing.  From my view, American Beauty is a reaction to cynicism and, furthermore, a rejection of it.  The film's characters are only redeemed when they abandon their cynicism and/or negativity.By the way, my personal opinion is that the female characters in the film are redeemed just as the male characters are (a lot of reviewers don't seem to agree).  For example, I think Carolyn's last action in the film really demonstrates that she is beginning to heal.  Think about what she does and keep in mind that she is not yet aware of another recent plot occurrence.A perfect cast, a talented director, an inspired script, even an appropriately quirky musical score - American Beauty has it all.  Movies are almost never this good.  10/10",10,0,0,6 March 2000
The Patriot," reminds me of another movie...
","Comparisons to Braveheart are too obvious to make, but The Patriot also reminds me of another recent film - Gladiator.  There's at least a few parallels: good visuals, convenient ending, lack of historical accuracy.  So watching either of them is the same kind of experience.So basically, if you like Gladiator, you'll probably like this movie and vice versa.  Both are worth a viewing, both are somewhat moving, both are ultimately not that memorable.  7/10 (a point less than I gave Gladiator, true, but that's because I found The Patriot's score a little too generic)",7,0,0,29 July 2000
Rules of Engagement," A great movie, but...
","For my money, Rules of Engagement is the best movie so far this year.  I wish that were saying more, because this film isn't great, but it should have been.Rules of Engagement has a lot going for it, including a perfect cast and superb direction.  Jackson, Jones, Pearce, Kingsley - all give great performances, especially Jackson, who is even more intense than usual (check out his eyes in this movie).  Also, Jackson and Jones have a particularly good onscreen chemistry, neither overshadowing the other when they're in a scene together.  Add to that Friedken, a director with a good sense of atmosphere (the scenes in Yemen are especially well done), and one would think the movie would be perfect.And it almost is.  So what kills it?  The last fifteen minutes or so.  I understand that this script went through several rewrites, and the story's original writer, James Webb, came close to completely denouncing the film. It shows towards the end of the film, at which point the movie suddenly makes incredible leaps in logic and realism that it has no business making. It's just another example of Hollywood pandering to its audience when it doesn't need to, and, in my mind, the entire rest of the film points toward an opposite ending.  Rules of Engagement could have been a high 9 or a 10 if the ending had been better, so its good points still make it worth watching. Still, I can't help but wish the film had stuck to the real world a little bit more.  8/10",8,0,1,9 April 2000
Mission: Impossible II," much better than the first
","I thought the first Mission: Impossible was stupid.  To be honest, much of this second installment is stupid, too, but it's so much more fun to watch. Sure, the relationship between Cruise and Newton is forced and laughable. Granted, most of the film's action sequences are unrealistic, and slow motion shots are used entirely too often.But director John Woo sure knows how to make an exciting movie.  Even though I was certainly aware of the impossiblity of Tom Cruise's Double Dragon style fighting maneuvers, I was nevertheless entertained.  Really, the trick to enjoying this movie is simple: just don't expect to take it seriously (and to laugh occasionally).  7/10",7,0,0,28 May 2000
The Insider," I was surprised - this is a really good movie
","Frankly, I would have never seen this movie if not for it receiving a Best Picture Oscar nomination.  Generally, I hate 'issue' movies, even when I agree with the issue being presented; usually, such movies allow character motivation to take a back seat to social commentary and end up preaching at viewers.  Not true with The Insider.  Whereas screenwriters Eric Roth and Michael Mann could have spent all kinds of time complaining about the evils of Big Tobacco, they're much more interested in telling the stories of Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand.Well written, well directed, and well acted, The Insider has quality leads in Pacino and Crowe.  Also, as a person living in the South, I admire the film for not portraying Southerners as idiots, as many Hollywood films do. And I loved the unconventional soundtrack.If I had to find something to complain about in this film, it would be that I think Jeffrey Wigand fades a little too much into the background towards the end of the film; his reactions to events could have been detailed a little further.  And I don't think Mike Wallace would realistically be dumb enough to yell at one of Shiekh Fadlallah's bodyguards.  Still, The Insider is quality entertainment and worthy of its Academy Award nominations. 9/10",9,0,0,3 March 2000
The Hurricane," make no mistake, this movie is nothing without Denzel Washington
","Never before have I seen a movie in which the lead actor is so definitely the central reason that the movie is good.  Denzel Washington does a perfect job throughout the film.  I think Roger Ebert said something like 'he explodes onto the screen.'  I'd agree with that.But, it's a shame that Washington's Rubin Carter is the only round character in the film.  Everyone else, particularly the Canadians, are ridiculously one-dimensional.  I also think the use of Bob Dylan's song about Carter's case is a mistake.  While important to the story, the music itself comes off as upbeat and is jarring in the context of the film (but, then again, it might just be that I can't stand Bob Dylan).Still, Washington is so good that the film's failings become almost excusable.  If ever there was a year that I would want to see two actors get the Oscar, this is it (I know it won't happen, but I'd like to see Washington and Spacey share the award).  9/10",9,0,2,13 February 2000
Scream 2," it's full of flaws, but who really cares? (spoilers)
","Oh goodness.  Let's review what I consider to be the top five continuity problems / unlikely occurrences from Scream 2.5.  Cici's fall from the balcony is inconsistent with the way she is thrown.4.  Sidney and Halle switch places in the car.3.  Seven major characters just happen to find themselves in the same place for the film's climax (Sidney, Gail, Dewey, Debbie Salt, Mickey, Cotton, and Derek).2.  While the climax definitely takes place at night, the very end of the movie, which we are made to believe occurs right after the climax, appears to be happening at noon.1.  The killer is apparently clairvoyant and/or psychic.And yet I like the movie (and the other two - which are also flawed in such ways) anyway.  In truth, I let the Scream movies get away with more than any other series of movies out there.  This is partly because all three have their share of clever moments, but I think it's also because I'm not sure how many of the problems are intentional.  They're good movies almost in spite of themselves.  8/10.",8,0,0,9 February 2000
The Green Mile," A best picture nominee? It doesn't begin to be worthy
","A film that is not worthy of the Best Picture nomination it has received. My biggest complaint is that all the characters are static from beginning to end.  Characters who are good stay good, characters who are bad stay bad, and no one changes - this is more a chain of incidents than a real 'story.'But, furthermore, as a representation of Death Row, The Green Mile comes off as artificial.  All the guards (save one) are essentially good-hearted, laid-back, and a little too generally relaxed for their occupation.  None of the inmates (again, save one) seem to deserve to be there.  It's a happy-go-lucky environment where they occasionally execute somebody.  What a statement (though, I do give the movie credit for at least treating the executions themselves seriously).And the mouse - goodness, the mouse.  I'm sorry, but I find cute, little rodents to be out of place in serious drama.  For the purposes of this film, I guess it's supposed to illustrate the humanity of one of the inmates, but it comes off as a cheap attempt to try and manipulate the audience into some kind of 'Aw, Shucks' mindset.Not that The Green Mile is a bad movie, but it is nothing more than a mediocre, functional film elevated only by a fantastic performance from Michael Clarke Duncan (receiving the only Oscar nomination I think this movie warrants).  Darabont and Hanks have both done better work and, for that matter, so has King.  6/10",6,0,1,16 February 2000
Scream," I like it, but sometimes I don't know why (yeah, there's a spoiler)
","Sometimes I don't know why I like the Scream movies.  Sure, they are funny, and I do find them all to be acceptably suspenseful, but they're all extremely flawed, as well - including this, the original.  While this movie probably contains less flaws than the other two, it's still full of continuity errors and unlikely occurrences.  The question is, how much of it is intentional?  Who can tell? (Example: *spoiler* somebody fakes his death with ketchup while making it appear to an onlooking character that he really is being stabbed by another character.  Come on.)In the end, though, it doesn't really matter because all three movies manage to entertain despite their flaws, partly due to decent acting on the part of some of the supporting players (Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and especially Jaime Kennedy) and the direction of Wes Craven.  I do NOT, however, credit Kevin Williamson that much.  While his concept is good, he really only creates a couple round characters and his script succeeds onscreen only because of the aforementioned individual efforts.  One need only look at anything Williamson has ever done outside of the Scream series to realize how bad a writer he really is.Incidentally, I predict that the Scream movies aren't going to age well - not at all.  Why?  Because all three are so wrapped up in nineties dialogue and pop culture references that in fifteen years no one under the age of 25 will understand them and those older than that will probably be embarrassed that they ever did.  Still, in today's context, I give all three an 8/10.See also my reviews of Scream 2 and Scream 3.",8,0,0,9 February 2000
The Sixth Sense," I've seen it four times now...
","And I still love it.  I can honestly say at this point that The Sixth Sense is my favorite movie ever.  In my opinion, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty, Dr. Strangelove, The Usual Suspects, and every other truly great movie I've ever seen.  To use a common but appropriate cliche, The Sixth Sense is genius.And it has so little to do with the ending, which seems a common fixation in this forum.  I love the atmosphere, the low-key performance of Bruce Willis, the breathless acting of Haley Joel Osment, the brilliant usage of color and setting, and the overall quiet and meditative pace of the film.  Shyamalan seems to have a real 'less is more' philosophy of directing, and it works to this movie's advantage again and again.  A superb movie, and still a 10/10 in my book.  Do see it, if you haven't.",10,0,0,3 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," a beautiful, beautiful film
","A lot of focus is given to this film's surprise ending, which some people complain they can see coming (although I didn't).  But, the ending, although a great and beautiful one, is not the best thing about this movie, nor is it a good reason to see it.  For my money, the reason The Sixth Sense is so good and so respected stems from the atmosphere that it creates.  This is a quiet, meditative movie - one that draws you into its core and actually fosters that 'wow' sensation that movies are supposed to create (most don't, if you ask me).  The acting is superb in its subtlety - not just in the case of Willis and Osment but also supporting players Williams and Collette.  Of course, Shyamalan's excellent script and direction don't hurt the movie either.If you figure out the ending early on, don't worry about it.  It's worth your time to see how the story plays out.  Also, be sure to pay close attention to the role of the color red - it has an important symbolic function.  10/10",10,0,0,3 February 2000
Gladiator," highly watchable, but not at all a masterpiece
","Visually speaking, Gladiator is fantastic, the depiction of Rome being particularly impressive.  Furthermore, even at two and a half hours in length, the film is never boring, and I can't complain about the acting, either.It's too bad therefore, that the ending is so mediocre.  The entire production seems to fall apart in the last twenty minutes or so, climaxing conveniently rather than realistically.  And, of course, the film isn't historically accurate, but who would have expected it to be?Now, I don't mean to say that Gladiator isn't worth watching.  In the end, it's a good way to kill a few hours; just don't expect it to amaze you. 8/10",8,0,0,28 May 2000
