Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flawed Intro to the Prequel Series
","I WON'T DESCRIBE THE PLOT TOO MUCH, SO HAVE NO FEAR IN READING THIS...Flawed, clunky dialogue, a ridiculous digitally rendered unecessary character, and some weird Lucasisms all mar slightly to what is a fantastic wild ride back into the Star Wars universe.The first 20 minutes are out of some dopey old dimwitted western, but once it gets going...all in all...Episode One is a great primer to the new series. Liam Neeson, suprisingly, fills the boots well as a mentor, as Ewen MacGregor is fittingly subdued as a jedi-trainee (though one desires more). Jake Lloyd has been unfairly criticized and maligned for acting like what exactly he needed to be...a six-year old. The only dud to this cast is the commercialistic-child-placating retarded-Ewok-like character of Jar Jar Binks. He is far too much concentrated on, and completely not needed. This is not a deeply emotional film that needed the comic-relief...and mostly, Jar Jar is completely unfunny.The story itself is somewhat light, like a re-intro to the scheme of things. Episode One slowly puts out tendrils of plot that will be pulled upon in the 2nd movie. It isn't very surprising, in fact, it is very predictable. But, what carries it is the tremendous visual effects, as well as a middle racing sequence that is an ode to Ben-Hur. The final sabre battle, however, is what wraps this film nicely.Obi-One's rise to manhood (as a Jedi, of course), the finding of the young Anakin, and the rise of Senator Palpatine are the real focuses of this film...and all point to the real crux of this series...Episiode 2.
CRITICISMS:Lucas, however, I hope will let a real screen writer go to work on future movies. His making 'The Force' into something genetic is idiotic, and goes against the mythical spirituality of the previous Star Wars films...in fact, it actually goes against the psychological and philosophical precepts of those films. And, his biblical implications towards the father of Anakin Skywalker is completely bizarre and silly. Get a grip, George...let's try for something less egotistical here. This isn't the old testament.Plus, the lack of real tangible character development is muddled and incomplete. This series screams for Lawrence Kasdan's return - for it needs his developmental touch. Also, the directing could use improvement. It is directed like any film school grad...no real good shots or techniques. Impact by technology is in place of impact of good filmaking or storytelling, ultimately.
WRAP-UPAll in all, this movie, as I said, is a great primer to what one hopes is two great movies to come. See it, experience it, and understand its flaws...it's a jewel nevertheless.",5,0,1,21 May 1999
