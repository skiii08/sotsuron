Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," loads of special effects and not much else....
","As a person who saw the original Star Wars when it came out back in 1977,i must say i was extremely dissapointed with this film - there was none of the wisecrack's and tension of Han Solo/Princess Leia, Darth Maul as a character could have been developed but ended up being a shadowy figure (who he is , where does he come from???) - which is a pity, as he could have been one of cinema's best villians.At the end of it all, i thought - yeah, great CGI graphics, but crap characterisation and a really really bad storyline.Here's why... a) this is supposed to be set 40 years before Star Wars - so why did the Empire start using humans instead of the droids you see in phantom menace?b) errr... all the droids fail because the central mothership is destroyed - COME ON! - Mr. Lucas - you're telling me that a droid that can talk and have severely high A.I. by our standards requires a central computer??????c) alien accents - the baddies 'japanese' style accent is really racist in my opinion. Jar jar is ok - i actually liked him!d) No plot development - it just goes whizz-bang to the next scene - before you know it the film is over, and you're thinking - 'what the hell was that???'  It doesnt give you a feeling of empathy with the characters.",Null,0,1,15 April 2000
Glory," One word - brilliant...
","This was an 'unknown' film to me until I picked it up from a video store a few years ago - and boy was i impressed with it. A superb cast, and excellent acting. The only fault is that it sometimes delves into sentimentality sometimes, but the battle sequences really make up for that - extremely realistic. Think of it as a 'Saving private ryan' set in the civil war. A great film - and one, might i add, that i've watched around 5 or 6 times now.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Gobsmacklingly stunning
","Simply put, this film will leave you begging for more. It packs an unbelievable punch - the battle scenes are utterly realistic. Its also filled with an eery sense of dread.The sheer evil contained within the Ring reverberates throughout the film - from Bilbo desparately trying to kick his 'ring habit' as if it were crack cocaine, to Frodo who is tasked with destroying the ring - even Gandalf can't take the ring due to its corruptable powers.Peter Jackson's landscape panning is utterly utterly mindbogglingly awesome - no 30 second CGI clips here mate, oh no. You want to see an Orc mine? - well Jackson obliges with a full panning , swooping camera that floats above and then dives deep right down into it. Want to see a massive battle between Orcs and an Elven/Human army - again, the panning camera shot, almost as if taken from an imaginary helicopter comes in. When the scene deserves a 'big' shot, by God does Jackson deliver. This alone should convince you to see it on the big screen - dont want for it to come out on VHS or DVD - this film was simply MADE for the big screen.This film deserves a multitude of Oscars. Not only for the cinematography and special effects , but more importantly for the character performances. Everyone here acts incredibly well - so well, that you really get into the characters and emphathise with the plight of Middle Earth.This is the best thing I've seen since Star Wars , way back in 1977 when i saw that film as a kid. Awesome awesome awesome....  1 year for the sequel to come out is too long - i want to see it next week please!",10,0,0,20 December 2001
American Beauty," Very deep and thought provoking...
","There's a lot of levels in this film. Whilst you think the main level is Kevin Spacey's character as a frustrated middle-aged man wanting to return to his teenage years, the film actually involves a lot more characters than you think. From the ex- US Marine father of the neighbour across the road,to the intense sex that the main character's wife (Annette Benning) experiences when she meets someone with money and power. But the most touching part of this film for me, is when Kevin Spacey finally meets the American Beauty.I wont spoil it for you though - but, believe me, there is a very touching and human element to this film. Although it may be portrayed as a 'mid life crisis' kind of film, its not. There's a lot going on, with lots of different strong characters at different ages all mixing into the pot.
I came away from this film more aware of myself, and more philosophical about life. And this is just a film.So, yeah, get this film out - it might make you think about life a bit...",Null,0,0,16 June 2001
Cross of Iron," this film definitely influenced 'Saving Private Ryan'
","I remember seeing this on video in the mid 80's and i could not believe that it was made in 1977 - definitely a film ahead of it's time. Jame's Coburn gives an absolutely superb performance. And despite all the blood and guts and realism of the film, there are some poignant moments - such as when the German platoon capture a young Russian child soldier and make him their mascot - a frankly bizzare situation, considering that the kid was trying to kill them in the battlefield!But the major acheivement of the film was the visualisation of the Russian's from the German's perspective - the Russians are shadowy figures, who are always attacking 'your' i.e. the germans, defences - this is a trick that Pekenpah plays with the audience, making them feel 'part' of the platoon and thus more involved in the film.You can see echoes of this technique in Saving Private Ryan, where the German's are also shadowy figures, who can be gunned down at a moments notice.Overall , a powerful anti-war film - it doesnt glorify anything - it just's shows war for what it is -  a hideous,and aweful waste of human life....",Null,1,2,5 June 2000
Stalingrad," A big dissapointment
","I saw this film on video around 1995. Since it was by the director of 'Das Boot', i was expecting the tension and drama of that aforementioned film - unfortunately i was incredibly dissapointed - poor plot, poor acting, and poor attention to historical detail. I honestly turned the film off half way through, and then thought to myself 'Hell, its an intelligent film - i should watch it again' - i did, and i watched it right through the next day - with exactly the same opinion intact - i.e. it's really a big letdown. This could have been Germany's (since it directed by a German) BIG apology to the rest of the world for what they did in Russia. Instead I got melodrama, and a boring plot. What i was looking for only appeared later on in Saving Private Ryan - what a missed opportunity. This could have been a masterpiece..... If i were you , i would wait until the hollywood version of 'Stalingrad' comes out (it's currently being filmed)....Sorry guys - Das Boot was superb, but you really messed this one up...",Null,1,5,5 June 2000
Pulp Fiction," One of the greatest films ever made
","This film is a classic. And its the dialogue that really clinches it for me - sharp, snappy, humorous and delivered at a break neck speed - so much so, that the subtleness of it requires you to re-watch the film time and again. By now, i've seen this film 15 or so times and new things still pop up. I won't go over the context or the plot of the film as this is well covered by previous comments - needless to say, you can download the script from the Net and it literally jumps out at you. Its an incredible read. Now if the script is THAT good, no wonder Travolta and Keitel wanted to do it. An awesome film - the No.1 film ever made in my estimation.",10,0,1,2 October 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," read the other reviews!
",i really dont have any more to say - except read the other reviews - they really say it for me. In other words - this is one of the greatest movies of all time. This is an absolute masterpiece and it will be definitely a film that i will gladly show to my grandchildren in the mid-21st century - IT'S THAT GOOD... watch it and learn.....,10,0,0,5 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Made me get into computers
","Other things have been said about this film, so i wont go into the details of the plot or characters or special FX or whatever. What i want to add is the human element. In particular, the effect this film had on me when i was seven years old, watching this film in 1977 when it came out. It completely changed my life. After it i wanted to find out more about science, astronomy, computers - i wanted to find out more about technologyAnd as a result, 20 or so years on, i'm now a programmer , designing Web apps for a living. All thanks to that Death Star sequence with the flashing groovy 70s computer graphics at the end of the film.George Lucas - if i ever meet you, i'm gonna shake your hand. The fact that i have my house, my job and a happy wife is down to me as a 7 year old watching that film.
This isnt just a film - this is a part of 20th century history.",10,0,0,16 June 2001
Gladiator," A must see film - but with some flaws
","Dont get me wrong - i totally enjoyed this film. It has action, history and love all rolled into one. In other words, passion simply oozes out of the screen at you. However, I felt that the link between the battle scenes at the start and the gladiatorial combats was a bit weak. In fact, the battle scenes were in my eyes far more spectacular than the colluseum scenes. I wanted to find out more about the roman army - i wanted Maximus to continue his campaign. The scenes of the Roman army in combat were so utterly realistic that they took my breath away. I wanted to find out how this army conquered all of europe - hence my dissapointment when it was over after one battle scene.So, the vista is left open for someone to tell the story of the Roman Legions - not about some trivial gorey battle in the Collesium, but about the real life and brutal facts about being in a Roman legion and going out there and conquering the world. That is a story that is still untold, and is waiting for some director to really do it justice.On a final note - Russell Crowe was superb in this film - absolutely brilliant. A long , and Oscar awarded career awaits this guy. Watch out for him...",Null,0,0,31 October 2000
