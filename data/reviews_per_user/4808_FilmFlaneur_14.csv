Changeling," No masterpiece, but good enough
","Changeling is Clint Eastwood's 31st film, one of five he has released in the last four years. Although with Gran Torino the now-elderly star has announced his probable retirement from acting, in other ways he shows little other sign of slowing down, being now in the middle of 'The Human Factor', due out next year. At the tail end of an illustrious career, Eastwood's stock as a director has remained high throughout, his concerns consistent. He learnt his trade at the side of such American professionals as Don Siegel but arguably has superseded his mentor, and others, as the years have passed.Based on true events, Changeling continues the feminist strand in some of Eastwood's work, where the casual, callous treatment of women, taken either as the main or side event, forms part of the narrative. The film is sturdy, reliable, involving and includes an outstanding performance by Angelina Jolie as the mother who won't give up. If there's an unspoken 'but' in that last sentence, ironically it's because the film is so thoroughly excellent all round, but no more. The art department is painstaking in its recreation of period detail, the narrative deft in projecting its chief protagonist through various trials and tribulations (including traumatic incarceration in a mental ward for her obstinacy); John Malkovich plays well as the crusading Reverend Briegleb, who takes Collins' cause to the wider public, and so on. Even the film's less satisfactory elements, being those for the most part surrounding Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) the child abductor - whose representation as an unbalanced individual is a little too exaggerated, and the associated gallows scene has been questioned by some critics - do not really detract from the overall achievement. But a thoroughly good, decent movie is not necessarily a great one, and ultimately it lacks an edge at its centre.Changeling locates the dark heart of its city in the corrupt administration of justice, doled out by well-played cops and officials who might, never the less, have strolled in from any other good movie. The immorality reaches out of city hall to pervade and ruin the lives of those who cross it. Polanski's Chinatown dealt with corruption, albeit at a slightly later date, festering at the heart of personal and civic society, also in historic L.A. But there the malign influence spread outwards from the individual and family towards the environment. It's a reverse process which started that masterpiece off with a cynical, dark heart denied to the less scabrous family drama sitting at the core of Changeling: that of Collins' separation and continual love for her missing son.Christine Collins seeks justice. The sort of justice that will do is never in doubt, right down the verdict of the final trial, scripted with the help of existing records. To take one more observation from the earlier film, in Chinatown the justice required is often fateful and unclear, making the reaching for it seem far more dangerous and, perhaps, more memorable. Missing persons, unsolved mysteries and corrupt officials are usually the province of the private investigator. Christine Collins' reluctant assumption of the role of heroine, aided by her reverend friend and supporter, is something the story made essential - even if a story played out through the persona of a distraught mother could easily become melodrama.It's to Eastwood's credit that it does not. Despite Collins' lurid treatment in the mental home, electric shock treatment and all, the director's restrained treatment of the subject matter, as well as the inherent dignity of Jolie's character, all buoy the film up, whilst Malkovich's dignified contribution to proceedings adds a further touch of class. Eastwood's empathy with actors is such that Jolie, in the DVD interview accompanying the movie, claims at one point that she only wants to work with Eastwood from now on - a flattering exaggeration, but doubtless reflecting the high regard he gets from colleagues. The director's calm, proficient touch is everywhere until, it must be said, even the matter of serial child torture seems de-sensationalised, the unpalatable made practically palatable. Perhaps this is one reason why the execution scene and asylum shock therapy is emphasised as it is, in order to restore something of the necessary horror and revulsion back to the narrative.Critical niggling aside, none of this is to say that Changeling isn't a success on its own terms, deserving of high marks. Excellence brings it own rewards; here's a movie which never drags, provides consistent, entertaining drama showing old-style film making at its best.",8,1,3,28 May 2009
Come and See," One of the greatest wars films ever made
","One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.At the heart of the narrative is Floyra, both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the film's narrative, his history a horrendous coming-of-age story. It begins with him laboriously digging out a weapon to use and much changed at the end, he finally uses one. As he travels from initial innocence, through devastating experience, on to stunned hatred, in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes, both inside and out. His fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses, frequently staring straight back at the camera, as if challenging the viewer to keep watching; or while holding his numbed head, apparently close to mental collapse. Often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view, the formal quality of Klimov's film owes something to Tarkovsky's use of the camera in Ivan's Childhood, although the context is entirely different.The film's title is from the Book of Revelations, referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 'Come and See' is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war, but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path, witnessing with vivid immediacy the Belorussion holocaust at close hand. Here, the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera, point-of-view shots, and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events: the small animal clinging nervously to the German commander's arm for instance, soundtrack distortions, or the mock Hitler sculpted out of clay and skull.Main character Floyra is the director's witness to events, a horrified visitor forced, like us to 'see' - even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly. For instance during their return to the village, there is some doubt as to if Floyra is yet, or will be ever, able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events. In one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them, Glasha's reaction to off-screen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling. So much so, we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on. Its a watershed of innocence: one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm Floyra - just as later, more explicit horrors do the viewer.Come And See was not an easy shoot. It lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including, at one point, wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp. Kravchenko's face is unforgettable during this and other experiences, and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences. The sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, as did elements of a much-commented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire. Klimov's camera ranges through and around the atrocities, although one doubts that a steady cam was available. By the end Florya is isolated from humanity, technically as well as mentally, by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground. Disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are, others such as the scene where Florya and the partisan girl Rose visit the forest after the bombing, achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the Hollywood production. And whereas Spielberg's work concludes with a dramatic irony that's perhaps a little too neat, contrived for different audience tastes, Klimov's less accommodating epic finishes on a unique, cathartic moment - no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed, but one which sends real blame back generations.Hallucinatory, heartrending, traumatic and uncompromising, such a movie will not to be all tastes. It certainly does not make for relaxing viewing, although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after. This was Klimov's last film for, as he said afterwards 'I lost interest in making films. Everything that was possible I felt had already been done,' no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece, which would be hard to top. By the end of their own viewing, any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the Great Patriotic War - a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation, symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front. If you feel, like I do, that any real war film should succeed in conveying the power and pity of it all, then Come And See is an absolute go and watch.",10,399,456,29 December 2004
Blade," Brain on hold for this modern take on vampire hunting
","Like a Terminator crossed with Peter Cushing's Van Helsing, Snipes' vampire hunter dominates this film with all the subtlety of a stake in the heart. This is not a film for thinking about too much, or too hard (although some of the high-tech changes to the elements of traditional cinematic vampire hunting are imaginative). This is a gory action event, that drags the viewer by the scruff of the neck and doesn't let go. Personally I found the action scenes generally exciting, although sometimes Snipes' casual body count has as much impact and significance as the shadowy victims slaughtered off hand in a flashy computer game.Norrington's direction is flashy and occasionally impressive. He has successfully exchanged the traditional gothic, stately panorama of Dracula for a more hi-tech, fast moving vision of disease, subculture and degeneration. Ultimately, though, it is the figure of Blade, the cool dude crucified on the cross of his repressed vampirism, that remains with the viewer, and one hopes that in the sequel his character is expanded and deepened.",Null,0,0,24 October 2000
The Jungle Book," The King of the Jungle
","Criticising The Jungle Book - or Disney's most popular film titles generally - is probably seen as close to heresy in some quarters. After all, it's just for kids, right? Wrong - it's the things that are 'just for kids' which are often the most insidious. It's where layers of misty-eyed memories and nostalgia prevent a clear assessment of what's on offer, or how dated or questionable a favourite story can be. Fear of 'reading too much into it' often precludes critical engagement.The Jungle Book has many strengths (and the rating I have given it echoes that feeling). Its characterisation is bold and colourful. Sherman and Gilkyson's songs are justifiably classics. Bruns' music is evocative and apt. The plot is well paced and structured. If the animation is not outstanding (particularly when compared to the triumphs of Fantasia and Snow White) it remains perfectly adequate. And yet, and yet...Why the hesitation? Elements of racism in the movie are certainly stumbling blocks. Louis Prima, although Italian, sings like a black and to modern eyes at least his monkey-man routine should be taken less lightly than it usually is. Baloo speaks for himself, jive daddy talk and all in comfortably stereotypical fashion. Creatures with dignity and power, in contrast, like Shere Khan or Bagheera, tend to have upper class 'English' accents implying disapproving class and authority.Then there is the question of women - or rather the absence or them. Mowgli one of the long line of orphans in Disney animations (an honourable exception being 101 Dalmations which, constrained by an original, actually has both surviving mother and father figures for the main characters). Sadly Mowgli is one who merely encounters one potential father figure after another. When a female of his own species finally appears, at the end of the film, she is diminutive, housework orientated and apart from singing, singularly bereft of conversation. For the Disney animators, the whole forest is a male playground, one created for jokey bonding and Mowgli's rite of passage, in a scheme that is especially peculiar to the studio. The only exception to this rule of thumb is Colonel Hathi's wife, and remains in vaguely mutinous isolation, happy to support Mowgli in his quest.Disney's cutsie anthropomorphism is such a common occurrence in his output that it seems natural and all of a piece here. Indeed so used are we to this way of showing nature, that sometimes we forget what we know must be the truth. This is a world, like all of the studio's others, where animals are treated either as objects or, more reassuringly as 'people' with no species life of their own. Its the ideal jungle for Uncle Walt: no creature need be considered at all except in human terms, and everything knows its place. Nature, normally 'red in tooth and claw', sings a comic song for its living, and then is divided into a facetious social system of character actors, ugly and sweet, cunning and charmingly dozy.And what of Mowgli's journey, his travelling from place to place, from animal kingdom to man-village and from childhood to the brink of manhood? At first sight it seems to be a rite of passage, a period of trial bringing him to maturity. But Mowgli actually learns very little. All Baloo teaches him is how to eat fruit without worrying about the little unnecessary issues in life. His fight with Shere Khan springs more from ignorance and stubbornness than any acquired sense of self preservation or knowledge. Mowgli make some temporary friendships, grows dewy eyed at his first sight of a female.. and that's about it. As a moral journey, it is a failure. (A similar vagueness attends Pinnochio's 'education' where any benefits of experience are overruled by the Good Fairy's largesse) If The Jungle Book intends to provide a lesson of some sort during Mowgli's procession through the undergrowth, then it fails.Millions have enjoyed Disney's classic before and will do so in future. But at least if we face some of the issues raised, and take a critical look at a characteristic reworking of the source material, it will make the walk through the jungle more interesting.",Null,1,11,22 September 2000
The Aviator," Scorcese back at close to top form
","The Aviator finds Scorsese back at close to top form after some of the disappointment that attended The Gangs Of New York (2002). This is partly because in Howard Hughes the director has once again found a driven, flawed character such has typically appeared in his most successful work. Like a Travis Bickle, Henry Hill, or Jake La Motta, Hughes is another self-tortured soul on the way to a dramatic end, a journey whose effects are orchestrated by a filmmaker currently at the height of his powers. And unlike the narrative weaknesses which informed his previous film, The Aviator has a strong story line with a coherent and compelling sweep, one which takes events down several decades with ease. The Academy obviously thought so, as the film won five out of its 11 Oscar nominations.At centre of Scorsese's biopic is reclusive flyer, aircraft designer, film producer, eccentric lover, and multi-millionaire obsessive-compulsive Hughes, whose colourful career surely provides enough material for a dozen films. He's been portrayed before of course: notably by Tommy Lee Jones (The Amazing Howard Hughes, 1977), and Jason Robards (Melvin And Howard, 1980), and others. But none of these previous incarnations had the benefits of Scorsese's budget or his undeniable cinematic flair. Combined, they make for compelling viewing as we see Hughes' private life and career rise and soar, before entering the turbulent years of rivalry with Pan-Am over the transatlantic aero market and the entrepreneur's increasing mental problems. Indeed, part of the fun of Scorsese's film lies in the symptom-watching, judging just when the hero famously tips over the edge, anticipating his future years hidden away in shrouded hotel rooms with long nails and matted hair. (This viewer has it when Hughes raises his hand into the air, as if suddenly noticing germs, during a late screening of Hell's Angels). Scriptwriter John Logan co-wrote Gladiator, and so he's well used to organising a larger-than-life central character, while his writing on RK280 (1999), an account of the genesis of Citizen Kane, showed an informed and affectionate interest in the legendary tales of Hollywood. Like Welles did with Kane, Logan places the origin of Hughes' personality quirks firmly in his childhood, and includes a suggestive opening scene neatly encapsulating obsession, cleanliness, and aberrant sexuality.Some critics have felt that the director could profitably spent more time on Hughes' years as a recluse, but this would have meant a different, longer, and perhaps less satisfying film. In fact Leonardo DiCaprio's performance remains strongest when relating to others. His moments alone in his room, while dramatically necessary, are arguably weaker than when the declining Hughes interacts with disturbed intimates, although even in this isolation Scorsese gives madness a fascination of its own.DiCaprio's acting is to be commended in a film covering such ambitious ground, and is generally successful. One is reminded of Giant (1956), a film in which another youthful actor, James Dean, is called to play a character ageing over a span of years. Like Dean, DiCaprio is perhaps still too fresh faced be entirely convincing as a mature man, but its only a minor distraction. In fact this is the best he's been for some time, proof further that under Scorsese's guidance the actor is doing his finest work. The director certainly has no reservations about DiCaprio having already announced his starring part in a new gangster project, 'The Departed'. A fine supporting cast, notably Cate Blanchett as Hughes' main infatuation Katherine Hepburn - the only woman who apparently gave him a run for his money - and a still sprightly Alan Alda, marvellous as scheming Senator Brewster, helps matters along considerably.Inevitably in a film titled The Aviator, there's a lot of flying and chat about planes. Fortunately, Hughes thought big, and his outlandish projects (including one seaplane the 'Spruce Goose' the biggest ever built and which hardly flew) are eye candy in themselves, while Scorsese revels in the enthusiasm and drive which Hughes brought to his projects. Indeed Hughes is seen taking almost sensual pleasure in the smooth fuselage of his prototype aircraft, his hands feeling for the flush rivets with the same suspenseful concentration as he had earlier seducing a waitress in a club. In fact one senses that Hughes 'flies' his sexual conquests with the same daredevil and rocky approach as that with which he conquers the skies, as his career runs a fine balance between business and obsessive pleasure, risk and enterprise. The inevitable smash-ups, personal or mechanical, when they occur are well done whilst the surrounding intrigues of Hughes' life, whether in the studio, bedroom or congressional committee provide more than adequate distractions from any mundane aspects of aircraft engineering. In Scorsese's hands ultimately the 'aviator' of the title becomes more than a flyer; it becomes the defining mark of a man who took risks, lived too fast, perhaps rose too high until, Icarus like, he was doomed to collapse back.If there's a criticism of Scorsese's film it is that a good deal of the real life Hughes' more unpalatable character has been suppressed. Like Ford's Young Mr Lincoln (a film which Scorsese admires), there is an occasional air of hagiography about the man in earliest days, a visionary blessed by his personal integrity. But history tells us that this was someone who was a serial seducer of starlets (a characteristic made more palatable here), was rabidly anti-communist, and hated blacks. Clearly a lot of the extreme Hughes was jettisoned to make him a more sympathetic character but, sometime, there is still yet room for a rabid anti-biography.",8,0,0,3 September 2005
Face_Off," Woo's Best American Picture so Far
","After a rocky start with 'Hard Target', Woo's early American film career continued in an upward trajectory with the underrated 'Broken Arrow', before culminating in this film, a highly characteristic deconstruction of the American thriller. (One might argue that then a disconcerting falling-off began with 'Mission Impossible 2', but that's another matter.) Once again Woo uses Travolta to good effect, establishing him as a preferred actor only this time in a plot that is, to say the least, bizarre. 'Face/Off' - at least to those who carp about such things - is unrealistic, unconvincing and, frequently, just down right silly. In this film it seems, the 'willing suspension of disbelief' has to be suspended so high, and so frequently, that it is almost out of sight.But criticisms circling around the questionable realism of the film are missing the point. Woo comes from a film-making tradition where 'common sense' and 'logic' (particularly in action/fantasy pictures) are not considered by viewers as important as they are to audiences here. Stunts and plot lines regularly defy what would be our natural expectations and logic, grounded as we are in the different Western, realist tradition. In his film Woo uses the distancing, and peculiar advantage, that this cultural difference brings, creating an ironic comment on the action film, as well as indulging his own thematic obsessions. The 'face/off' procedure is simply a plot device, a MacGuffin (to borrow Hitchcock's term for a red herring) allowing Woo's exploration of these concerns. In this light, it's not important that the operation is plainly absurd, or that Cage and Travolta are obviously different body shapes. What matters is the play that this change thereafter allows the director on identity, moral values, audience expectation, acting styles  - and all the rest.As if the underline this, Woo has the actors make a unique, artificial 'face off' movement (down the face with their hands) when the magic words are spoken on screen, a visible mantra to the whole procedure. The implausibility is thereby *emphasised*, not hidden, a dramatic device made into a flourish, not a liability. Woo in short doesn't care about plausibility, because his true concerns lay elsewhere.But the sniffing at Woo's substantial achievement continues. Yet no one criticises Franju's 'Les Yeux Sans Visage' - which is equally ridiculous in its central conceit - even though there we are supposed to take the operation seriously. Perhaps because this type of event is 'allowed' without raised eyebrows, in our regular horror tradition we wave it through. In Frankenheimer's 'Seconds', to take another example, Rock Hudson is miraculously (and to my mind absurdly) created out of a body of a shorter, middle aged man. 'Seconds' is a (good) film without a post-modern idea in its head - yet has won plaudits because of the wider social issues it addresses away from the unconvincing new identity-creation.'Face/Off', in short, requires a more sophisticated response from some critics and action fans than it has so far received. A comparison with some of the less complex and more mindless action pictures that appeared at the same time (the overrated 'The Rock' for instance) reveals considerable strengths and virtues. Whereas other action films come and go, 'Face/Off' remains obstinately in the mind, teasing the genre, inviting repeated viewings.",Null,0,0,12 April 2001
The Butterfly Effect," The Power of Narrative
","Amazingly, from the people who brought the world Final Destination 2 and the obscure Blunt comes The Butterfly Effect, a Donnie Darko-esque tale of time travel and rearranged reality, ending with a characteristic sense of loss. Common to the two films as well is the theme of child abuse, a dark undercurrent playing a more central role in Butterfly certainly, but which in both cases serves to anchor fantastic goings on elsewhere in a more brutal reality. Along with the more systematic arrangement of linear time by Memento, such films show a concern with the mechanics of storytelling rare in modern American cinema, and which reintroduce some avant garde techniques back into the mainstream.Darko has his malevolent rabbit as the principal instigator of events, Kutcher has his journals. Both provide a way into different perspectives as time frames and points of view shift, at length providing the audience with an ambiguity that's intoxicating as much as it is exciting. But whereas Darko was more concerned with the personalised mechanics of a form of 'time travel', and impending disaster, what lies at the centre of Butterfly is slightly different. Bress and Gruber's film carries its heart a metaphor for the power of written and viewed narrative itself, in which ultimately the importance of the reading the 'text' is as significant as it was in the aforementioned Memento. Kutcher's journals (or the old home movies he views) is the text here, which dictates the movement of the plot, readily changing perceptions and expectations. By accessing these documents, by revisiting stored events, the hero can alter and hopefully enrich his experiences - a vain hope, as it emerges. 'Just think of your mind as a movie, you can pause, rewind or slow down any details you want' he is told at one point. Projected on the screen of his unconscious, such reclaimed memories can overcome blackouts and even effect history. By focusing on such an implication, narrative in general - and cinema's primacy in particular - is affirmed.",9,0,2,30 March 2005
I Am Legend," Worthy sucessor to previous versions
","Any film which holds nice Emma Thompson (here playing a 'Dr Crippen', crime buffs please note) responsible for the death of 5 billion people can't be all bad - and I AM LEGEND, fourth version of the famous work by Richard Matheson, is almost all good. Despite those who harp on about the changes from the source novel and the undeniable weaknesses in the CGI department LEGEND, like Smith's earlier I ROBOT, proves an above average, pleasurable surprise. Smith plays Robert Neville, ostensibly the last man on earth, fighting the zombies of the dark while struggling to isolate an antidote to a virus which has destroyed humanity. Swopping THE OMEGA MAN's over talkative, white haired soul brother brethren who menace Charlton Heston for more fearsome, inarticulate brutes is a real improvement, while Smith's sensitive portrayal of Neville brings to the surface a humanity and sadness streets away from Heston's chess playing, machine-gunning white autocrat.In one scene Smith tearfully asks a shop mannequin to talk back to him. To his credit the actor walks away from this moment with his dramatic integrity intact, and introduces a pathos missing from the franchise before. Whether or not one sees the enhanced Christian subtext as successful or not will be a matter or taste (I gave it the benefit of the doubt), but the film retains the central irony of an atheistic hero proving the salvation on mankind. In any case it is no more subtle - and arguably less blasphemous, should one care - than Heston's carefully staged 'crucifixion' death scene in OMEGA.Interestingly the new script has Neville refer to his perilous existence as 'ground zero' - a phrase particularly pregnant in the context of mass death, aptly recalling the apocalyptic mood of 9/11. Like the contemporary American mood, Neville too thinks he can 'fix it' (i.e. put the status quo back together again) a view reinforced by the final image of LEGEND: a fortress community, a ideally harmonious USA in miniature perhaps, and one presumably besieged by hostile attackers.Criticism of LEGEND has largely been levelled at the last third which has been taken as inferior to the first two - an opinion no doubt started by the American market which saw a feel-good ending. For the UK DVD release this has been replaced by something more downbeat and is more powerful even if there is a sensation of rush in the wrap up. The most memorable parts of the film remain those which evolve around the lonely Neville in a deserted city, which is convincingly realised.Smith's portrayal of a haunted hero, broken by the death of his dog, is a fine one, and lifts the film well above average. It's a sign of the changing cultural times that Neville's solitary trip and mouthing of the words from the anti-establishment WOODSTOCK in THE OMEGA MAN is here replaced by an equivalent moment before the family-friendly SHREK, enjoyed amongst sympathetic company at that, an altogether less powerful moment. And if perhaps the closing 20 minutes do seem a little breathless, then this is a minor miscalculation in a genre piece which I think will bear revisiting",7,1,5,24 May 2008
The Hurricane," Good film that could have been better
","'The Hurricane' is the most recent cinema release by NormanJewison ('Cincinnati Kid', 'In The Heat of The Night', 'Thomas CrownAffair ' (1968), 'Rollerball' etc) whose 70-odd years don't show inthis engrossing and well done true story of racism, wrongfulimprisonment and the human spirit. In one of his better roles,Denzel Washington plays the framed boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carterand his struggle for a successful appeal after 30 years in prison.There's something of the anger that Washington communicated in'Malcom X', as the understandably bitter Carter traces his woesback to a colour-prejudiced system in general and a racist cop ingeneral.However Jewison's liberal credentials lead to a slight wooliness inthe background of the film where greater realism would have beenmore effective. For instance Carter's stay in prison is notable for the lack of any violence, intimidation and menace (excepting his one stay in'the hole' upon arrival.) He is allowed to keep his clothes distinct, to write books, to avoid prison fatigues and keep to his cell or watchTV. Such slightly unbelievable events contrast with the moresentimental and successful 'Shawshank Redemption', where onefeels the hero has something to rebel against, besides merecontainment. (In a revealing casting decision, Clancy Brown, thesadistic Captain Byron Hadley in the earlier film, here plays anaccommodating and non-threatening prison guard). The effect is toreduce Carter's imprisonment to something less than the inhumaneexperience he claims it is. Similarly the three Canadians who take up Carter's case have littleto do (although they are supposedly instrumental in helpingCarter's final appeal in the Federal court) except make house call,thumb through paperwork and look concerned. The script fails tomake them interesting or give them any real dynamic, while theirrelationship to each other is entirely unexplored. The romanticattraction of one of them to Carter is hinted at and then leftundeveloped. Vicellous Reon Shannon, playing the young blackstudent won over by Carter's book and who first takes up hiscause, is also rather too good to be true - occasionally comingacross as chubby and gauche, rather than shocked then convertedto the boxer's plight.In short this is a film which, despite the anger which must exist inthe original source (Carter's prison book) has led some of it slipaway except for Washington's intense and charismatic performance. This is a shame as the film is well done, with aninteresting structure. The case was sufficiently unknown to me tomake the result of the climactic court case suspenseful. The firstthird in particular creates tension by juxtaposing past and presentevents, establishing a true sense of time and place. Washington'sfans will want to see this, and if it proves Jewison's last hurrah onthe big screen (he's done a TV movie since) it is entirely creditable",Null,0,5,15 October 2001
A Hard Day's Night," The Best Beatles Film
","The first - and best - of the Beatles' feature films, A Hard Day's Night purports to cover 36 hours or so in the life of the Fab Four in the run up to a live TV performance. The director, Richard Lester, made such archetypical 1960s' films as The Knack (1965), How I Won The War (1967) and Petulia (1968), as well as another less successful Beatles' film, Help! (1965). His style, at once comic and gently surreal, is at its best in the present production, which gets much of its strength from an informal mockumentary style. It is shot in an apt black and white, and the Group are ably supported by a rich array of British character actors.The decision to assemble a swollen supporting cast was a sensible one. As actors themselves the Beatles, while at this stage in their careers unassuming and fresh in their own right, are no less, and no more, than can be expected from any amateur dramatic performers. Musical impressions aside, Ringo is perhaps the most charismatic one out of the four, George the most wooden. The other two just hang round cheerfully. Lester acted on these understandable deficiencies by regularly breaking the dialogue scenes into short, pithy, elements in which the Four, when speaking, do so virtually in catchphrases. Spoken in isolation then assembled into an off-the-wall continuity by a skilled editor, many of the weaknesses could thus be minimised, at the same time improving the film's pace. And by surrounding the guys with a pleasurably distracting range of minor turns (Wilfred Brambell, Norman Rossington, John Junkin, Victor Spinetti, Deryck Guyler, Anna Quayle, Robert Ray, Richard Vernon, Kenneth Haigh, et al), the dramatic weight could be further distributed away from a weak centre.The result is a film which is very light on its feet, in which the Beatles' slightly smug solecisms never drag or appear self-indulgent. Chief amongst the professional actors around the Four are Brambell (as Paul's erstwhile granddad), their permanently stressed manager Norm (Rossington) and the sweater-wearing and vaguely feminine TV director, (Spinetti). Interestingly, while the band are pursued and besieged by women, and repeatedly express their desire to make female acquaintances, the film explores primarily a *male* musical universe. During the press reception they flirt with women journalists; later Paul and another Beatle are seen chatting to some dancing girls. John is cornered by a woman (Anna Quayle), for some notable sexual banter on the theatre's backstage stairs. Outside of these accidental meetings, women, or more specifically girls, are kept at arm's length - either literally behind a physical barrier (as during the performance on the train) or left ineffectually screaming in their seats in the televised concert scenes. In a film beginning with famous images of mass female pursuit of their objects of desire, none of the Four are either caught or confronted by these fans, whose adolescent desire is appreciated, if never explicitly acknowledged. The Beatles are a self-referential, sealed unit, thereby contributing to the feeling of claustrophobia they experience, and creating the dramatic impetus which drives much of the later plot: the need to 'escape' and find some degree of relaxation and freedom. This is most made concrete with the 'Ringo on the loose' scenes, as the drummer dons a cap and raincoat, grabs a camera (he's the only one of the group associated with non-musical interests) and heads off to the canal. Allegedly stoned while he was acting these scenes, Starr's wonderings might have strayed in from a different film. They have a meditative and lyrical quality about them, providing a welcome contrast to the madcap pace shown elsewhere. Drugged or not, Ringo's escape also injects a dramatic crisis into the film - will he or will he not be back in time for the live broadcast? - which the film needs, to avoid a feeling of flatness in its last third. The only other 'escape' in the film is less adventurous, but funnier, as Harrison wonders into a fashion guru's (Haigh's) office and gives blunt Liverpuddlian comments on a range of trendy clothing ('I wouldn't been seen dead in that'). This scene, for all of Harrison's shortcomings as an actor, is also one of the best dramatically: a moment when, temporarily freed from his Beatles' locus, Lester can ridicule the absurdities of youth fashion and prick the whole 1960s style industry.Outside of the Fab Four, and the source of the longest running gag ('He's very clean isn't he?') is Paul's grandfather, played by Brambell. His scowling face, deviousness and cynicism born of experience is a necessary counterweight to the charming, yet flighty, naivety of the Four. Having little or no familial contact with his relative, it is he who persuades Ringo to step outside the theatre to do his thing - an act for which he later apologises, but that we feel has been for the ultimate good. It is Granddad, too, who remains the most resolutely anti-Beatles in tone and appreciation, and his final presence and enjoyment at the concert is less than convincing. It is interesting to consider the likely effect had Lester cast Brambell as the Police desk sergeant for the arrest scenes, rather than the genial Deryck Guyler. In A Hard Day's Night the police are comic stooges, generally inefficient. They never offer any real threat to the disruption offered by the Beatles' mild anarchy. There is little of the social confrontation that would develop as the decade wore on and the Fab Four's politics became more obvious. Brambell's underlying caustic nature would have made all the difference. The concert is the thing. Lester's film shies away from social concerns, and the boys remain above controversy. The plot even includes elements of whimsical fantasy, as when Lennon abruptly vanishes from his bath, or when the Four's instruments suddenly materialise to play in the guard's van. These timeless elements, as well as Lester's light directorial touch, are what have helped it to remain undated and fresh; the film still enjoys a large following and belongs on the shelf on anyone who enjoys 1960s culture.",Null,1,1,4 October 2002
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A Korean Private Ryan to savour
","Taegukgi Hwinalrimyeo (aka The Brotherhood of War) is the most expensive film ever made in Korea and the biggest home hit this year. It is directed and written by Kang je-gyu whom some dub the 'Spielberg of South Korea', and indeed his film has a framing device which is very Private Ryan-ish, and although most of the ensuing film is concerned with the reuniting of a family, it is to a different point. One suspects that home audiences are less concerned by this indebtedness than Western ones might be. The film uses the 'two brothers go to war' storyline, but the peculiar nature of the North-South conflict ultimately gives the family dilemma a wider meaning, their travails reflecting the national estrangement and the recovery of the missing - a thematic reference growing as common in Korean films as is the shadow of nuclear disaster in Japanese.Taegukgi contains very violent, extended war scenes full of those realistic effects which marked out Private Ryan, and has a similar epic feel. Its well shot and, even at 160 mins, (Director's Cut length: a shorter single disc DVD set is also available) never boring. However the film suffers rather from a melodramatic storyline, elements of which seems too contrived to entirely convince, including some amusingly telegraphed business (e.g Enemy commander in HQ bunker, by which the hero is waiting and listening, having fought his way through the lines heard shouting : 'Men! If they succeed in taking this bunker then we are all finished!') and hoary clichés like the extended train-side farewell, participants running down the station platform to say a tearful goodbye and all. In contrast, one or two other moments were very moving (one standout is the climactic reunion sequence) and the extended, successful staging of the action scenes, full of devastating modern effects, will make this viewer revisit it again soon. Not among the very greatest war films, principally because of these plot weaknesses, and its sentimentality, even if it makes a brave try - but well worth seeing and I think is still the best war film of 2004.",7,2,11,23 December 2004
1408," Room 1408 - I won't be visiting it again
","Despite a promising cast, (John Cusack, Samuel L Jackson) the latest Stephen King adaption 1408 is a big disappointment. Sceptical ghost hunting author Michael Enslin (Cusack) blithely checks into the infamous NY hotel room, after strenuous efforts by the manager (Jackson) to dissuade him, primarily on the basis of 1408's frightening history: multiple deaths during its previous occupancies, a series of fatalities which include leapers from the high window, suicides, self-mutilators as well as many others not officially counted as they are from alleged 'natural causes'. Spending a whole night in a room or venue supposedly haunted is Cusack's modus operandi when researching his books on the subject. Jackson assures him that sticking more than an hour in 1408 will be a real something in itself...Resolutely lacking much in the way of real suspense, instead substituting a couple of full colour ghosts, manufactured shocks, including the usual blood leaking out of wall cracks, claustrophobic chase scenes, bricked up windows, fluctuating temperature schemes, a couple of awkward dream sequences, as well as being interspersed with a maudlin supporting plot based around Enslin's grief over his dead child (which plays an important part of the climax) 1408 is very much the haunted hotel room by numbers, utilising a over stretched dramatic structure which ultimately seems less a genuinely effective device than a way of making a predictable series of events more interesting.Acting alone on screen while reacting to this host of paranormal blather a lot of the time, the normally dependable Cusack does his best but, as the duly anticipated shock moments come and go more or less on cue, the whole thing remains unmemorable and just drags on too long. The initially highly rational Enslin also gets rattled much too quickly for this viewers taste, and remains rattled for too long without much self examination or investigation of his fears. (an interesting conspiracy theory concerning the hotel staff is played down) . Ironically, if the famous haunted room had been one placed in a sterile, modern hotel, it would had been much more frightening - neatly exemplifying Enslin's line about 'the blandness of evil'. As it is, amidst the Gothic, dark panelled veneers of the The Dolphin nothing is really more than we expect.Jackson looks slightly out of place as a posh hotelier with just one or two major scenes to steal, and this reviewer for one will turn to SNAKES ON A PLANE again before this out of his recent appearances for most pleasure, a film which certainly had more entertaining, and better paced, scares than the largely po-faced 1408 mostly lacks. For a more interesting and heck, just plain fun version of the-author-facing-the-dark-forces thread in film I recommend Carpenter's decade old MOUTH OF MADNESS way over this, as at least it successfully suggests the disorientation and mounting distress of those literary doubters who stumble across, or provoke, evil forces.",6,0,0,12 November 2007
Ben-Hur," Classic Epic still holds up as the best
","One of the landmarks of epic and, arguably world cinema, Wyler's 'Ben-Hur' holds up well today. It was conceived by MGM as an eventual follow up to the success of Quo Vadis? (1951). Almost four hours in length, including substantial overture and entr'acte music by the redoubtable Miklos Rozsa, the film garnered 11 Oscars in its year - a feat echoed recently by Scott's 'Gladiator', to which unsurprisingly it bears some resemblances. (The return of the wronged, or the cathartic role of the arena for instance.) But there are vital differences, principal of which is the fact that, while Scott's epic is a pagan film predicated around the expectation of glorious death, Wyler's work is deeply Christian: 'a Tale of the Christ' as the titles announce, hinging on the acceptance of eternal life.'Ben-Hur' has a very considered structure, following Juden Ben-Hur's life and reconstruction, interposed with scenes from the life of Christ. In the first half we see Ben-Hur's fall from wealth and influence as a merchant, onto his fortunes as galley slave, rescuer and friend of a roman consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), then successful charioteer before returning to Judea to claim his vengeance. The second half includes the climactic chariot race between him and his enemy Masala, his confrontation with his mother and sister's leprous condition and, finally, Ben-Hur's witnessing of the crucifixion. Thanks to spectacular scenes such as the galley battle, the entry into Rome and, not least, the 20-minute chariot race (which took three months to film), attention in this mammoth epic rarely flags. Having said that, the first half of 'Ben-Hur' has more energy than the second, an issue primarily springing from the source novel. Wallace, its author, had planned his story so Ben-Hur's bitterness peaked just before the great race. Once the competition set piece is over and Massala dispatched, longer contemplative scenes inevitably follow as Ben-Hur broods on injustices. Like the leprosy of his relatives, he has a sickness albeit not physical, which must be cured, whilst in terms of action his rage has effectively exhausted itself.
As the principal male hero, Ben-Hur is one half of three strong male relationships in turn (Ben-Hur/Masala, Ben-Hur/Arrius and Ben-Hur/Sheik Ilderim). Although the relationships are fraternal, Ben-Hur's unmarried status, as well as the closeness of these associations with other single males (Arrius's wife is dead and Ilderim's several remain curiously unavailable) are enough to raise a vague question mark, at least in the minds of modern audiences. Kubrick would explore the homosexual elements prominent in ancient cultures more explicitly in 'Spartacus' a year later). In the more conservative 'Ben-Hur' the closest we get to the homoerotic torsos - a characteristic of the peplum cycle from Italy born on the back of such successful films as this - is the sight of an oiled and pampered Massala accepting Ilderim's bet with his fellow athletes and colleagues. By remaining unmarried, enslaved, and lost to his country, in the first third of the film Ben-Hur remains a curiously emasculated figure.
There are other awkward moments in the film centred on Ben-Hur's character. It is hard, for instance, after seeing him as the mature and successful head of a large household in the film's opening scenes, to find him then reborn as Arrius' 'son' three years down the line. At the same time, Ben-Hur's sudden (and un-illustrated) rise to prominence as a charioteer in Rome feels like a lame device to further the plot, clumsily preparing us for his necessary skill in the big race later.Lew Wallace conceived 'Ben-Hur' as a didactic work as much as one of historical adventure, key moments in the life of Christ to be viewed in connection with those of an aggrieved man of action. Understandably, the film makes more of the possibilities of action, and less of the religious message. One result of this is that it is noticeably successful in communicating reverence without boredom, a fault of several other 1950s epics. Always difficult to portray, Christ is never heard speaking directly, his face never seen. Instead we witness the impact he has on people's lives. Instead of Christ the man, we have the events he occasions: the Passion is treated as an event of political significance to Judah and his family. The *socialising* of the Christian message is in evidence, rather than any crude proselytising. But once Massala is gone, Christ's continuing 'unavailability' to the viewer reveals a dramatic lack: we miss a necessary balance to Ben-Hur's strengths and convictions, where another rounded character might have stood. Ben-Hur's conscience fights on, but in a campaign vacuum as it were, and because of it he becomes weaker.
Interestingly, although Rome as an invading force is decried by Ben-Hur, apart from the harsh life of slaves and some enforced tax collecting there is very little to criticise in the Imperial occupation of Judea. Messala's twisted sense of justice is clearly a personal aberration, springing from his ambition. Both Tiberius and Pontius Pilate (who offers the Judean his citizenship) appear as reasonable men. Christ's trial is presented very briefly and then seen only at conclusion. One Roman even admits that Christian dogma is 'quite profound really.' Ben-Hur perhaps implicitly grants the value of Rome as much, accepting the role of Arrius' son, even appearing before Massala in a toga. If not quite a tacit acceptance of 'what the Romans have done for us', Ben-Hur could be far more condemnatory towards those fighting the fledgling religion of the Jews. Truly the film takes Christ's words 'they know not what they do' as understood.
'Ben-Hur' then, is that rare creature, the restrained epic. Perhaps because the source is a novel than taken direct from the Bible, it manages to balance the sublime and ridiculous into a still-satisfying whole, balancing great spectacle on the one hand with subtle veneration on the other. Together with Wyler's direction, Heston's tailor-made presence, Rozsa's grand score and a unleaden cliché-free script it still makes 'Ben-Hur' first.",Null,2,5,1 February 2002
Sin City," Sin City - sorry, guys...
","Just saw this for the first time and, oh boy I wanted to enjoy it. But while I appreciate that I am probably in a sulky minority of one, I'll admit to being a little disappointed. Praise has been heaped on the film by fans who see it as one of most successful realisations to date of comic book to big screen, and the stylisation was striking which one imagines is, alongside with the dialogue, Miller's chief contribution. But to this viewer it still seems a shallow film despite (or because of) these origins, another to add to the increasingly empty tally created by Rodriguez, even if not quite so annoying as the macho posturing of Once Upon a Time in Mexico - another film in which the director thinks showing 'cool' is the answer to all the requirements of an action narrative - or the self indulgent mess of Lava Girl, come to that. Aided by the author himself (and by Tarantino as well, apparently) Sin City has mostly the same tone throughout, either a gravelly-voice gravitas instituted by the principals or a continuous tone of humourless, hard boiled pastiche - fun in a short film maybe, but wearing after half an hour or so. When lighter-hearted moments did occur - such as when a henchman idly contemplates an arrow through his chest - it was much needed contrast. God help the viewer who opts for the 140 minute expanded edition coming in December.This while the joining together of different stories, even if it cemented Miller's vision, wasn't exactly subtle either. Gone, certainly, is the narrative skill of Pulp Fiction and perhaps Tarantino could have been brought earlier at the script phase as the arch dialogue, while initially fun, is a million miles from the memorable banter between the thugs of Reservoir Dogs. But perhaps Miller thinks what fits in the speech balloons of a comic is good enough to carry things along on screen over a much longer stretch of time - sadly, it's not.One doesn't have to be a feminist either to find the treatment of women less than enlightened: either conniving, weakling or, (as a token gesture perhaps) temporarily empowered by the plot only to have the masculinity of events take them over. The whores of Old Town may fire the guns down onto their enemies, but its the men who always do the significant talk and walk. (And wasn't that female-samurai sword killer a new stereotype, something we've seen already in Kill Bill?) The film makes up a sort of adolescent wet dream of 'cool' violence and mild S & M which shows the influence of Tarantino and crowd more than any particular imagination. I've nothing against screen violence, cool or not, but when most else is stripped out so that it becomes the raison d'etre of the narrative, leaving only style behind, it left this viewer at least feeling sorely cheated, and desperate for some variety. A good word here, though for Micky Rourke, who in Marv created the most memorable character and who elicited genuine sympathy; a bad word for Clive Owen who seemed miscast to me, as well as the variable female actresses who populated 'Old Town'. And what's with Bruce Willis' Hartigan? A tough guy who complains about being an old man, close to retirement, on one last case etc, only to be shot endlessly, all this before leaving prison '8 years later'... looking as spruce and as youthful as he went in (greeted by a similarly unchanged Michael Masden I may add)? Maybe I am getting too old, but I found it hard to finish the film, and ultimately I found it irresistible to imagine some of Sin City's most fervent adherents uncritically watching the show on offer with the same rapt, brain-dead expression as the prematurely de-limbed Kevin..",6,8,17,30 September 2005
