Hereditary," What a disappointment!
","I can't believe the rave reviews. The first hour is boring, with lots of eerie music, and you are just waiting for something interesting or scary to happen. Then you get a series of arbitrary 'shock' scenes where people you don't care about die. The ending is meaningless and unsatisfying. A good Toni Collette wasted on a lousy script.",1,7,17,13 June 2018
