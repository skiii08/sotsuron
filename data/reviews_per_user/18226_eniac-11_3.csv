The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Third time's (not) a charm
","The focus of the movie seems pretty weird. While it's about human suppression and control, most of the movie is focused on the few people Katniss care about and all the time and resources put into saving them and making sure they are OK.It kinda put the more interesting storyline in the background as an excuse to fill up a movie that is just too stretched out. I can't see how they god the idea of splitting it into two parts.As I liked the first 2 movies I feel like this third one is a bit out of place. Maybe it shouldn't have been made. Maybe the script should have been different. I think there was potential for a third movie but I think they missed it.",5,2,5,19 November 2015
Cloverfield," Hand-held sucks
","If the camera hadn't been hand-held shaking through the whole movie it might have been at least an 8, but the filming made me quite dizzy and though the idea was quite good, it ruined the movie because there was no 'real' steady filming at all.Also this hand-held filming took out any excitement and shock-effects.If the same movie was made with proper filming i might actually consider go seeing it again! The sequel won't get my money if it is made the same way as the first.It's the first time i actually wanted to leave the cinema before the credits.",2,6,12,6 February 2008
The Cabin in the Woods," Bummer
","This is the stereotype movie of some young people going to a place far from civilization to have a fun weekend and then stuff happens.Sounds familiar? Have we not seen this kind of movie like a hundred times?I was told that this movie wasn't as you'd expect so I gave it a chance. Minute by minute I got more and more bored, and when finally reaching the credits I really felt I'd wasted about 90 minutes of my life. What a bummer.If you are into those kind of movies I guess it's OK, but otherwise stay away from it.",3,2,5,28 August 2012
