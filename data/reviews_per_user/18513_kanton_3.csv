Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A disappointment
","Being a Star Wars fan since the first film, I can't help but feel let down by Episode 1. George Lucas having Industrial Light and Magic to play with, produced a film that was more a video game than a film. I still don't understand why I should be excited by the pod race sequence. For all its special effects it was boring.I also hated the fact that they tried to explain what the Force is. Instead of leaving a mystical vagueness about the Force, they started talking about mediclorons or chloroforms or whatever. And if I remember correctly they also used second rate sci-fi terminology about symbioms and other crap. Lucas failed to understand the power of our imagination. Not everything has to be fed to us.And for all the special effects, the spaceships seemed more fake. They were shiny like they were in a dealership.Had they never been used before? The models in the previous films looked more real even in their simplicity.Finally, I really hope that we see some grown-ups in the next movie. No more kids and Jar Jars pleaseeeee!!!",5,0,1,22 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Heroes you do not care about
","I am a declared Star Wars fan and it is very sad for me to see how George Lucas transformed an epic movie into a video game. In the original series there were a group of people that you cared about and some that you feared or hated. In this one, the main focus of the film seems to be on the digital achievements of Industrial Light and Magic. No character development, no memorable dialogues.Furthermore, Lucas brought the action back to our times. Once the film was about a galaxy far far away. Now it is about Anakin riding the next flying model of a Harley and a Jedi Council conveining in what would be a Park Avenue apartment 100 years from now. And in E2 it seems that especially the Jedi forgot how to have an everyday conversation;Every sentence ends with 'apprentice'. And somebody tampered with the database and they have to meditate? Pleaseee!!Saddly, for the first time I recommend that people do not go to watch this movie.",6,0,0,9 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Bad script, undeveloped characters, aiming to be a Marvel movie
","DISNEY decided to turn the franchise into a MARVEL movie, devoid of any of theory and depth. But the worst part of watching this film is the weak and childish script:
1) The 'universe' is not consistent. Magical Jedi powers spring out of nowhere to support cringe-worthy twist plots in outer space(!) and are used by people never to have shown such competence in the Force. 
This means that anything can happen which also means that it basically forces the audience to only focus at the visuals because consistency, story line don't really matter and anything can happen.
(2) It's all a huge joke. Humor was always part of the SW saga. But now it's all about situational comedy with some chasing in between.
(3) As the middle part of the trilogy, it fails to deliver. Not to go 'ancient Greek theater' on you guys but a trilogy is all about (a)Good guys are on the rise, (b) Good buys suffer/bad guys win (c) Good guys win. This film is an unsatisfying combination of b+c, where good and evil fight forever after. Honestly, there is no underlying important reason to film the next movie. Nothing to expect!
(4) I start to be annoyed by all the political correctness and forced diversity out of Hollywood. The choice of a female hero combined with a black co-lead was courageous and worked well in the previous film... because it made sense!!!. Now
(a) it looks as if Disney said that we need an Asian woman in the mix and wrote a boring and outlandish sub-plot that took her from being a guard, to being Steve Jobs and then a pilot. The whole plot can be thrown out and the story does not change!
(b) I get 'girl power' (and I loved Rey in TFA!!) , but at a point when you are watching war scenes and almost all secondary characters (pilots, commanders, generals etc) are women, you have to say to yourself that this seems forced and intentional. I once knew war is tough and physically challenging.Enough said: a bad bad movie...",5,1,2,16 December 2017
