Walk the Line," Stays with you long after the credits roll.
","After watching this film I was sure it had something missing, that it was somehow floored. But on reflection, it's not. It's amazingly fulfilling and every minute enjoyable. The film is not a masterpiece. It rarely manages to delve into the subjects motivation and inspiration for his choice in music style. And I'm sure the Sun Records road show with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis and the likes had considerably more to tell than merely Cash's introduction to June Carter and excess. In general coverage of the limelight and overindulgence seems scant. But it's not a documentary after all, it's a love story.Is it well rounded and complete? I don't know and I'm not bothered. As a film in its own right it is fantastic.Undoubtedly, in keeping with every other review, but it's so prevalent to the film's success that it has to be said  the performance scenes are brilliant. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing their own songs and do an unbelievably good job. Their portrayal of Carter and Cash's romance is just as compelling and you just want to watch the character's appealing sadness with as many songs thrown in as possible. And that's exactly what this film gives its audience  complete satisfaction.Watch this, watch The Buddy Holly Story, and watch Ray because they're all great. After the relative disappointments of Kate & Leopold and Identity, James Mangold shows a return to form with his best film yet - 'Get Rhythm'.",9,1,2,18 February 2006
