Hereditary," Maybe the best horror movie I've ever seen!
","This movie is out on Amazon Prime streaming platform now so I thought I'd give it a chance. I knew very little about it. The first watch left me asking 'wtf just happened?', but whatever it was, I knew it had gotten under my skin. So I watched it again. This time I really paid attention to EVERYTHING! Even pausing it so I could really read what was on the screen. You have to look EVERYWHERE on the screen, not just at the actors. Look in the corners, the ceiling, the dark doorways, etc., even when the action is is squarely on the actors. Who, by the way, each give a tour de force performance. Especially Toni Collette. Wow! The second viewing left me so unsettled I had to turn on all the lights in the house. Since it's streaming now, you've got nothing to lose but time, so give it a chance. I'm amazed at the bad reviews and I have to imagine it's because they just didn't get it. It's a story of loss, and family secrets, with some of the most horrific elements thrown in for good measure. If you're into jump scares and CGI, definitely skip this, it's not for you. But if you want something akin to 'The Shining', you'll enjoy this movie. It's a thinking mans horror.",10,2,3,8 January 2019
