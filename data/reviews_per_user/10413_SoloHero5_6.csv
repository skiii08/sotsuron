It," Join the loser's club, and you'll float too.
","Night and day is a great way to compare this adaptation from its predecessor. It does follow the slow burn the original had but the chemistry the young actors portray, and the wonderful R rating definitely make its pace quite enjoyable. We are all fans of Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise in the 1990 It, and Bill Skarsgård decided to honour that by making this Pennywise his own... And he damn well nailed it. His creepy, childish demeanour will have you wondering what he will do next, and when.If you aren't a fan of the original, most will still leave the theatre thrilled with the nonstop bickering of the Loser's club kids, and you will certainly love the frightening clown with the red balloon.",9,5,13,7 September 2017
Twilight," THE HONEST TRUTH!! A good start!!
","As every fan knows the series is outstanding and this movie didn't get blessed with the same funding as say the Harry potter first hit movie: The Philosophers Stone, but it did very will with what it had to work with.I new virtually nothing about the Twilight series when I when to see this with my brother and from the first narrated line to the ending credits I for got to blink...It was great.Some of the effects didn't blow my mind but like I said they did what they could with what money they had. The casting was well done with a very few exceptions but all round well picked.I've since read New Moon and I'm currently working on Eclipse (both astonishing) and I can see that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are well portraying the roles given to them; they will do well throughout the remainder of the series.Twilight will not be the best in this movie series because Twilight made a lot of money, and funding should be no problem for the remaining films.If your kids are over 12 this movie will thrill the family If the men in the house can look over the very blunt (and enjoyable) love story and observe the breath of fresh ideas for and extremely popular theme of Vampires and ... Well I wont ruin the surprises yet to come...Well done Stephenie Meyer, Well done!!",8,4,8,18 January 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Don't be blinded by the fad, this is the truth.
","Don't count me as some 'Twilight, fantasy chick flick' hater, because I loved the book series and enjoyed the Twilight movie. Realistically the only good acting was Taylor, he transformed physically to become Jacob and his acting was rather spot on for his role. Everyone else was disbelieving and in some cases a little annoying (Kristen/Robert)!The movie was a basic adaptation to the book but when it was off it caused you to wonder if it was still new moon or a different book movie all together. I understand why they added some action scenes because lets be realistic, if they followed the book word for word everyone who hadn't read the book would have left the theatre thinking, 'Where was the vampire vs. werewolf stuff?'UPSIDE: Great effects, good laughs, and good action at points. THE BIGGEST FLAW: This movie is an absolute horrible message for young girls. It promotes, and in some cases allows teen girls to completely break down and risk their life for someone they are 'in love with'! The reason I say this is a bad message is that all teenage girls think they are in love, and that if they were to have their hearts broken it's okay if they just break down till some other guy can help them get better... sorry but that just isn't healthy.I'll leave with... Parents be wary and boyfriends, if you sucked it up through Twilight sorry but life's going to get a little worse when she forces you to go see this with her.",1,6,10,14 December 2009
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," They finally broke 5.0 on IMDb since Twilight! But...
","Let's be honest; we all know how bad the movie adaptations of the book series up to BDpt2 were, and if you think they were good then no disrespect but don't reed reviews because almost anything will entertain you.To start things off this movie is an improvement but unfortunately it makes very similar mistakes to its predecessors.Acting: Even though Pattinson has shown his acknowledgeable acting skills in some of his previous movies and the fact that this movie has some skilled acting veterans in its cast. Unfortunitly the acting is still par to the average soap opera. It voids emotion in the key aspects of the movie, and exaggerates in the miner scenes. Plot: I know people always say 'It was very different from the book.' But let me tell you... This was nothing like the second half of the book... Although that doesn't make it a pure disappointment(if your a fan of the series.) It had its action and emotion when it needed it but in all, saying it was way better then New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn Pt1 all together, does not make it enjoyable to the average observer.In closing, If you were a fan: then you will enjoy it like you have for all the Twilight films... If you are not a fan: you will wonder why these movies can make profit in the high hundreds of millions!",Null,28,85,16 November 2012
Toy Story 3," I'm 19 years old... but wile watching I was a child again.
","I'm nineteen and I wasn't as enthusiastic about going to see this as I was when I was eight years old.I entered the theatre; the lights went out, the movie began, and after the first twenty seconds I was a child again. The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.I went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.This movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn't any. I'm sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre... The best part, you can bring your kids.I can't vote... in my opinion ten isn't enough!",Null,28,30,24 June 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Surprisingly worth watching!
","New moon; as we all know, was one hell of a let down. Eclipse is most certainly a turn for the better. The acting is better, and the plot was a better fit towards the book storyline. I don't understand why the reviews are so bad... This movie is hands down much better then New Moon. And other then being pretty slow it was still very enjoyable. If your a Twyhard you will love it. If you are a critic you won't. And if your an average Joe, you will enjoy the movie. Every important detain in the book was covered in this movie, and it sets Braking Dawn up well when it comes to a continuation. I regretted seeing New Moon but I loved watching this adaptation. it would be a wise choice to read the short life of brew turner before you watch this film.",7,10,26,30 June 2010
