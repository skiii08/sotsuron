3:10 to Yuma," Don't expect too much, a moderate western...
","Contrary to most of the commentators here, I kind of thumb down for this movie. When I heard about the hyped remake with a hearth throbbing cast such as Crowe, Bale and Fonda etc, I thought this would be one of the spectacular movies of the year. However, from the very beginning there is something about the movie that makes you bored. The slow pace of the flick makes you flip over to another channel or doze off involuntarily. In my case as I watched the movie on board of a plane I just fast forwarded to skip all the in between scenes to catch up some exciting gun fighting episodes which you expect from any western. Basically the movie is focused more on the psychology rather than shooting. This might be a plus point for some, but for me it did not work out. When a western, I expect some slick shooting and fighting sequels. My friends, that's something you can not find in this movie. A good thriller, many tensions and a surprising end... But do not expect old school shoot'm up western with a good guy / bad guy plot.",5,4,10,29 February 2008
Total Recall," So good and so bad.
","I liked Total Recall. Not because it is a great movie. Because it is extremely entertaining and funny. Especially the one liners from Arnie. The plot is interesting, the cast is superb, the action is acceptable. All in all e great entertainer, you can watch again and again and it never gets you boring.Well, having said that, I have to come down to the business. Do not look for a logical plot in here. How can be a planet with no air can turn into a place with the atmosphere as the world has in seconds? Come on! Why would Martians build an engine to add Mars an atmosphere and left without doing it? How come did those funny looking mutants come up? The story line is confusing. When I watched TR first time, I understood nothing. Absolutely confused. It took me two or three watching to get who is who and what actually happens. Another weak point is special effects. Most of the effects look terribly bad and not convincing.In total, it is not a bad movie. Has lots of re-watching value. Do not expect a logical SF with brilliant FX. Just enjoy.",Null,0,3,4 November 2011
300," Not up to the mark
","After seen the trailers I was dying to see the movie. I guessed that this movie would topple 'troy' and 'the gladiator'. However, it did not take me long to realize that sometimes trailers deceive the audience. First of all, there is something wrong with the pace of the movie. It looks as if many scenes have been cut! Some parts does not connect well. (especially those parts which shows different stages of the war on the pass, elephants, rhino, etc.) I think the movie should have been some 30 minutes longer. Secondly, narrations and dialogs are awfully bad. There are only couple of one liners that remain in your mind. (Spartans, tonight we dine in hell!). The final is also very weak. I expected some more one to one fighting at least before Leonidas dies. He died too easily!! Overall, the movie has many weak points which put 300 even behind 'troy'! Do not fall for the trailers! Do not come to the hall with great expectations!",Null,2,5,19 April 2007
Gladiator," Gloomy epic
","Let me start by stating that this is not one of the best epic - Roman era movies ever. Not even close! As any historical movie fan, I was immensely impressed by the fight scenes. The movie should be credited with its success in the battle and hand to hand fight parts. It can be even said that Gladiator has the best ever 'arena - fight' episodes. Sadly, this is all there is to this film. The entire movie is dull and apart from action parts you keep yawning and looking at your watch wondering when the next action scene starts. Weak dialogs and gloomy air is the reason for the downfall of Gladiator. I still recommend it if the cinema hall you go allows you to go to canteen and have some coke between action scenes.",6,1,3,21 April 2007
