Kill Bill: Vol. 2," what it was about
","Well, volume 2 is a continuation of volume 1 (they are one movie, split into 2 parts) and the difference between the two of them are night and day. While the last movie explained very little in the way of plot, and the character's histories, Volume 2 gives you everything that you missed in the last installment. There was some amazing action in this movie. There were less grandiose battles, and more one on one settling of personal differences, which were intimate and really damn cool. While some of the characters may be a bit long winded about their pasts, or their motives, what they talk about is definately worth paying attention to. This will definately strike a chord with the fans of QT. This highly stilized, well directed movie had some nice suprises if you can forget the fact that you know what happens in the end. (I wonder why its called Kill Bill...) Every performance, from the Bride to B.B (her daughter)was stellar. With a jump start beginning, an emotional ending, and some great plot fleshing, action, laughs, emotion, and insight this conclusion of a revenge story, could not have been more sweet.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
