Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," it was a very nice movie
","You could say that the movie itself was a rather big success, even in Belgium. I found the movie very nice, as Borat would say, and I had more then one good laugh.The movie portraits a Kazak Reporter that makes fun of the US and A, but he can do this rather subtle, so most people think that his Hebrew gibberish is Kazakh, but in reality, it is more then one tongue...I liked it very much, a real must see, but you have to see it big screen. My brother, sister-in-law and myself went to watch the movie, and I can say that for the next few days, we didn't stop laughing, just couldn't. The site of Borat, dooming in our face, and thinking of the marriage without consent being planned, well, it just kept on coming back.I hope that there will be a sequel, not really one of Borat, but just, some more 'cheap' movies like this, but with enough humor to last for another year.",10,1,21,21 February 2007
