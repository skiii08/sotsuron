Minority Report," My opinion right after watching it for the first time...
","Being someone who has always had a strong interest in the future... particularly where our society and civilization is headed, what advancements we will make from the sociological to the technological to the spiritual... I have always enjoyed believable futuristic settings and scenarios in not only science fiction, but in all speculative fiction. So when I first saw the trailers for Minority Report I was immediately interested by the story, but I was looking at Tom Cruise in a Steven Spielberg action film which seemed very well polished and Hollywood. Naturally, I had my doubts. I waited until it appeared at the dollar theater and then procrastinated once again. Just recently, however, my roommates rented the DVD and I got my chance to check it out. Overall, I cannot confidently state anything negative about it without becoming more analytical than I care to. The setting was mostly believable, allowing a stretch or two for the precognition that the story is structured around. The characters were given a few touches here and there of depth, notably the way Tom Cruise's character had dealt with his loss of a loved one and how the side-effects of that were still affecting his life. The story was moderately complex, which was more than I expected, and actually surprised me more than once. In closing, I would most likely watch this film again, but I doubt that I'll ever end up buying a copy.",7,0,0,20 December 2002
