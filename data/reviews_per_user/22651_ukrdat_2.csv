Casablanca," Masterpiece
","It is surely the best films of all times.At first, when I haven't seen it, I thought it is overrated stupid drama as lots of films nowadays.I really hate romantic and drama films, I vomit from 'Titanic' and fall asleep on 'Schindler's List', but Casablanca...It's other. It has something. Something like charm, thing that can't be produced by modern technology or cutting edge effects. Casablanca is a film that you will never want to end. The perfect example of Noir, every scene can be considered a separate piece of art. How actors move, what they say, how they say, everything is PERFECT.And it was filmed more than 50 years ago. During war. Unthinkable. Now, I understand why people say that films long ago were better than nowadays. Cause they WERE. May be it is not the best film I ever seen, but it is surely 10 times better than any other Drama that I have seen.",10,2,4,5 January 2006
Sin City," The film is really pathetic
","I really liked the trailer and hoped that I'll see one of the most beautiful and stylish movie. But the reality was very different. Though the film really looks great, especially fighting scenes, but it is VERY, VERY, VERY DULL.Lots of talking. I hated that narrator, even in documentaries author usually doesn't speak so much. He just talks and talks. The things he speaks don't make any sense at all, they are just mad man's mumbling. The dialogs are just awful. Don't want even talk about them.The only thing I liked about the film (apart some fighting scenes - like one at the beginning) is gorgeous Rosario Dawson. Another great appearance of one of the the most beautiful girls of Hollywood.",2,3,7,26 April 2005
