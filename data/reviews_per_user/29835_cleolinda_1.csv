The Ring," Possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen...
","...and I've seen my share. It wasn't even the scares themselves--it was the lead-up to those scares, the sheer dread the movie made you feel, that made the payoffs so awful. I've read a lot of people complaining about plot holes, or things 'not being explained,' but I felt like the movie operated on its own sort of nightmare logic. That's why the supernatural things that happened were scary, and that's why the characters are in such a panic--and at such a loss--to explain or solve them. ***1/2 out of ****, and I'm definitely going back to see it again.",10,0,0,19 October 2002
