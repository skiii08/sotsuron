The Longest Yard," I'm satisfied
","I've seen the original so many times that I've got it memorized. Don't worry about whether or not this version is faithful or insulting to the original; it's entertaining enough on it's own merits. Come on, people -- this isn't a remake of Scarface with Jimmy Smits. Just take it for what it is - a good Adam Sandler movie.Just enjoy this one as if it was a 'retelling' of the original story - Sandler delivers a dry but warm performance, the characters are re-cast with some interesting modern jock celebs, and Chris Rock rocks, as usual. Go see it - no one will accuse you of selling out. (If they do, it's because they didn't see it).",7,1,3,6 June 2005
