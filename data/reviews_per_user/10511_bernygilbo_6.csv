Hereditary," Can't believe I hadn't seen it sooner
",A friend of mine recommended this film for me since I'm a can of weird random horror films. This has probably been the best horror film I've seen in the last five years. Kept you interested the entire time and wasn't ridiculous with the storyline as many horror films tend to do. Definitely couldn't suspect what would happen next. Left it open for a sequel and I hope they take advantage of it.,9,0,2,27 May 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Another gem from Tarantino
",I love Tarantino's film's. I love them even more when he casts gig time actors in them and have them say some of the funniest yet racially offensive things I have ever heard. Hilarious watching Brad Pitt explain what he was going to do to the nazi hostage. Priceless!,10,0,0,10 May 2020
Hostel," Another terrifying situation from Eli Roth
",He might not be the best at his craft just yet but he's heading in the right direction. What makes a great horror film is the feeling it gives the audience that this terrifying situation could actually happen. It had some corny dumb dude moments and it does take almost an entire hour before the action starts but the sheer terror you feel watching the last 45 minutes is priceless. Makes me never want to travel abroad ever!,6,2,2,10 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another masterpiece from the master
",I am a huge Tarantino fan. I've seen all of his films I can't tell how many times and still enjoy watching them even after seeing them an obscene amount of times. This movie was very entertaining. Leo and Brad are hilarious. I could watch them all the time behaving like idiot's. The film was very exciting and keeps you intrigued as to how bad it's all going to end. Pleasantly surprised how it ended and you will be too.,9,12,17,10 May 2020
Django Unchained," Another awesome Tarantino film
","This film rocked! I don't know how DiCaprio didn't win an oscar for that performance. Homeboy went all method screaming his head off, breaking a glass with his hand and just kept in character rolling with the fact he sliced his hand wide open. Did he stop? No sir! He wiped that bloody hand across his costars face and just kept going. Amazing performance!",10,0,0,10 May 2020
The Descent," Epic horror film
",Best horror film I've seen in years. Never mind how terrifying it would be to be trapped underground in a cave in the middle of nowhere but the creepy creatures they encounter are things of nightmares.,10,1,1,10 May 2020
