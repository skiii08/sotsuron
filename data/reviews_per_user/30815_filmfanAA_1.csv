The Ring," a visual treat
","***WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD***'The Ring' is a great movie.  It's a very good story (completely with deeper meanings and all), but I think that the strength comes from the visual interpretation.  De shots are beautifully filmed (f.e. on the island), the sound is excellent (f.e. the scene with the horse on the ferry) and the scary moments are surprising.  I really appreciated the subliminal effects (the ring is seen for a fraction of a second) as the film proceeded.  It's like you (as an audience)are a victim as well: you have seen the video, and as the days go by, you see the ring flashing before your eyes a couple of times.  At the end of the movie, you see the video in full speed and then... a black screen (no image, no sound...).  I thought that was very clever.So even if not everything is crystal clear (there are some weird things that I didn't really get), 'The Ring' is worth seeing for its visual style!",9,1,1,9 March 2003
