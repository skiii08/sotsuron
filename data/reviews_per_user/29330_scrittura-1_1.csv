Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I was very disappointed
","This film surely ranks as one of the biggest disappointments of all time. I liked it better the first time Lucas made it - when it was just good old STAR WARS (Episode IV). The plot was familiar, the fight scenes derivative of the original film.... Even the special effects seemed old and re-hashed. Just a let-down all around.",1,1,3,4 December 2003
