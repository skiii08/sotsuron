Walk the Line," Impressed with Joaquin as Johnny Cash
","I came away from the theater with a whole new respect for Joaquin Phoenix. I was amazed with his superb performance which was deserving of an Oscar, in my opinion. His acting was so natural and smooth that I became totally lost in his portrayal of Mr. Cash, which brought back memories of Johnny's performances on TV. I only knew bits and pieces about Johnny and June's relationship, but the movie left me feeling thoroughly involved in their trials and tribulations, and wanting to know more. I feel Reese Witherspoon was very good in her rendition of June Carter, but at times the wide-eyed cutesy-look and whiny voice of her 'June' was distracting, leaving me feeling she had slipped out of character into one of her prior movies. Joaquin and Reese are outstanding vocalists, no doubt about that Walk the Line is a winner. I've seen it on the screen and rented the DVD twice.",7,0,0,24 March 2006
