Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You really can't go home again...
","I saw SW-TPM just after midnight on premiere day.  It was definitely an interesting experience before the movie began, as the crowd was very pumped up and ready to go. As far as the film itself goes, I have somewhat mixed feelings about it. It strikes me as a normal ( and good ) thing that George Lucas obviously wanted to make a film that his, and other children would enjoy.  The only problem I have with his execution, is that I believe he went too far down the road with that mindset, to the detriment of the enjoyment of his adult audience. A large part of the reason that he has the financial capability to make this film in the first place, is because of the huge support of the previous trilogy by fans like myself, and I am a little disappointed that he didn't see fit to throw a bone or two to viewers that have, in fact, grown up somewhat since the original three films.  Having said that, I believe that filmmakers should follow their own vision, and Mr. Lucas's vision will certainly bring a new generation of fans into the fold. The film itself is a wonder to behold, visually.  It's hard to think of a sequence where computer graphics haven't been extensively used, and the results are really nothing less than dazzling.  The pace of the editing was a little on the jarring side, and gives the film a rushed feeling.  You never really get a chance to become comfortable with the scenes, or the characters themselves.  Generally, the acting is reasonably well done, considering the focus of the film isn't on deep characterization.  Liam Neeson does solid work here, and while Ewan MacGregor isn't given much to do onscreen, I particularly enjoyed how he was able to put some of Alec Guiness's cadence into his lines.  Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman do a decent enough job with their respective roles as well.  The actor whose work impressed me the most, was definitely Ray Park's portrayal of Darth Maul. Just the physical presence of this character was a treat to watch, and the film should have made more extensive use of him. All in all, SW-TPM was entertaining enough, and I would suggest that any adults wanting to see it should take your children, as I believe this will give you the best possible perspective to enjoy the film yourself.",6,0,1,21 May 1999
