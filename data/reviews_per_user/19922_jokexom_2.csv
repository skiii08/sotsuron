The Expendables 2," The strength is, crazy enough
","Together with 'The Expendables,' Sylvester Stallone has made the seemingly impossible: one collected in dismantling the most iconic artists of movie heroes past and present, the idol of millions, if not billions. The audience is appreciated and rewarded decent charges that much important, especially for such a standard project. And now, after two years, they return again to kill someone. Stallone gave the post of director Simon West, but continued to be responsible for the script. One can say: 'Old school is still alive!' Without further ado, the creators went through the typical and ancient: the scope is wider effects steeper, more characters. For the original composition joined by none other than Jean-Claude Van Damme, another veteran of the genre, Scott Adkins, Chuck Norris and the young guard in the face of Liam Hemsworth. With Van Damme is definitely not lost. Apparently, you miss the sane roles Belgian athlete, gave charismatic and impressive game villain. Corporate kick is worth something! As for Norris, though in the film and it's not much, but on this very much - it's nice to see Walker again in combat.It is clear that the artistic part is not so important, but try to keep at least some drama not a great success. At the level of ties, without overclocking the plot was given a trivial goal: to hunt down, find, kill. On the other hand, the chemistry between the characters is very interesting. Along the way are scheduled principal enemies, new friends. Fun to watch, and for the main characters: teasing each other Stallone Steytemom, harsh Lundgren, Couture and Crews fun.'The Expendables' is a case where the content prevails over logic. Do not be surprised to jump out of nowhere, the armies of soldiers, the sudden appearance of Schwarzenegger or Willis' arrival seemed to picnic. Hyperbole here and there. Although, to be surprised if Chuck Norris nearby. But hell, how does it look good, but you see these people. They can do anything.Inept in some moments graphics resemble an S-action film, but these negative emotions depart, when starting live special effects, which made quite soundly. Although, Sly antiquity to the third part is to come up with something newer because straight exploding car and house a little outdated. But landing in the pit or riding Schwarzenegger with Willis on a smart day to remember. Still, this is a movie moment, so to speak: a brutal appearance Norris, the final slaughter, Stallone battle with Van Damme - for such scenes and is looking like a movie.In some ways, the picture has become a self-parody. Not only is the number of jokes and funny scenes, rolls over, and the heroes themselves ridiculed as well as his former character: that Schwarzenegger will roll out something brand or deliberately asks only the biggest gun, the name Rambo or other similar reference slip. After all, how few have noticed, they all belong to the museum.Never mind that on the screen, it is important to who. 'The Expendables 2' - a unique chance to see the effect of those seemingly retired, already in the company of heroes of the present. Opportunity to once again experience the atmosphere of old school when the bad guys were just evil, and the heroes always win.",6,0,4,27 August 2012
"Girl, Interrupted"," cheerful crazies
","I generally like crazy movies. And here is one of the main roles of crazy Angelina Jolie, who, in my opinion, perfectly played a mentally ill girl.Crazy talk touched in this film. Especially in the beginning of the 'dream and reality - and have you ever confused?' ..Winona Ryder also pleased his character, and by the way, the characters of each character shown very clearly.In general, this film has collected a lot of great actors. There's even played Whoopi Goldberg.The film, to reveal the nature of the main character, there are constant insertion of the past, which helps us to understand what it was, and what will be the end of the film.Throughout the film we are kept in an atmosphere of madness. But we do not show the mental hospital in terms of 'this is a terrible place,' we see that the girls are not so bad. They have a great time in the clink place. They even play bowling.The phrase, when the main character and Jared Leto lie in bed, 'all at some point in thinking about suicide' suggests that it is. When we feel bad, and I want to do something with it, though, smart people immediately get rid of that thought, and continue to live on.It is said to play the mentally ill - is one of the hardest things for an actor, but I really believe that they are all a little bit of 'that' .. But of course, Angelina Jolie is just amazing. Especially her eyes, saying, 'Come on, do something bad.'",8,1,1,29 August 2012
