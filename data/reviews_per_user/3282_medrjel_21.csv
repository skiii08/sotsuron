The Rock," WOW! Fantastic Suspense Action/Adventure
","For a 2 hour+ movie, this movie has very few, if any dull moments. It takes almost 40 minutes for the main story to get going, but even in the setup you are entranced. Nicholas Cage puts in a solid performace, and Sean Connery is as excellent as ever. The story weaves itself with some interesting twists and turns, and even in a few moments of predicatbility, you can forgive them.I had put off watching it thinking it would be typical, but this is anything but.",10,3,3,30 March 2002
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Feel Good movie
","Here is another feel-good movie. The major fault is that it's not for kids, and most adults will shy away from it (as they tend to do in general), including and especially women, since most women would find no appeal in watching a golf movie. What a shame. Will Smith was solid as Bagger Vance, and the rest of the cast put in strong performances. Bruce McGill and Joe Gretch were well cast as the Pro's, and Matt Daemon (who normally I am not a huge fan of) worked well as the former whizkid of golf who returns for one more game. I guess if you like sentiment or need a 'feel good' movie, this is it for you.For it's genre and focus, it's well executed. My one criticism for it would be it's almost frantic paced, yet at the same time it meanders and goes slow. Because of it's genre and subject, it won't have wide appeal. To be a great movie overall, it needed something else that was lacking. I just can't put my finger on it. Again, it's a good movie for what it is, and I can understand the praise and criticism. Both sides have a lot of truth in what they say about this movie. I must admit, it was relaxing to watch.
In summary, I would suggest this movie to anyone in search of a feel-good movie, or just would like to 'slow down' for 90 minutes. Yes, even as frantic as the story moves, it feels slow.",5,1,3,24 February 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Nauseating
","I saw this in the theater, and was so excited to go. I left so upset. This movie is nauseating puke. The story is simple (which is good for kids), but it doesn't grow on you. If anything, it becomes more inane with each viewing. I know people who said I was crazy for hating this movie, that now understand what I see. This movie is not that good, though Speilberg would go on to do great movies after this.",3,6,12,24 February 2002
Unbreakable," Not The Sixth Sense
","Everyone was looking for the next Sixth Sense with this movie. It doesn't live up to that level. However, it's a decent movie in it's own right, wondering if in reality that superhero's really exist. Not really a movie for everyone, and I can see some people hating it, but I think it's pretty good. Check it out, but don't expect it to be close to the bar that The Sixth Sense set.",6,0,0,20 January 2002
We Were Soldiers," A Very real story
","This has to be the most real war story I have seen... ever. I found Black Hawk Down laughable, Windtalkers sad, but this... wow.This is an excellent film that tells the true tale from the biography of Lt. Col. Hal Morris. It shows the horrors that the families go through, as well as the men. It even shows how the 'enemy' are people too.I would like to make a personal editorial here, since I feel a great wrong has been posted about this movie by some people here... To all the people calling this flag waving propaganda, you obviously didn't watch the movie, hence I feel your votes should be removed for this film. If anything, it showed the horrors of war, how our men suffered for what was believed to be a noble mission, and how in spite of terrible odds they overcame, and the promise that 'No one will be left behind' was kept. I know people who were there. They ended up having nightmares because it hit so close to home. This was REAL. If it were propaganda, everyone would get home and we would all be happy. You want to talk Propaganda, watch almost any John Wayne movie, or even Patton. This was not. Men died. Good Men. Family men - on both sides. Yes, the only way we survived that battle was superior technology, but it was the only reason. They were dropped into an ambush, yet they survived. Lt. Col. Morris didn't come back proud of what he did, he was just happy the mission was accomplished and they survived. Yet, he was hurt badly by every wasted life. Propaganda? You totally missed the point! Is propaganda showing how we killed our own men because of our mistakes? Lies? Tell me, were you there? I didn't think so. Unless you were there, stop with the misinformation. Your the ones spreading propaganda and lies, not the film! If you want to get picky, then I will cover one more thing. Was there some fictionalizing? Of course! they had to squeeze in over 40 characters into a few leads! Lots of stuff had to be cut, so things were glossed over and cut. I'm not saying it's perfect in character detail, but the overall story was left in tact. This was not a Hollywood story even with the changes. The plot did not deceive. That battle was as real as a recreation could be. Even Lt. Col. Hal Morris, who is retired and was there, says so. Even my ex-boss and a couple other friends, who were either at that battle or at Nam, said so. If anyone has a right to point out lies, it's our ignored and abused Nam veterans.My apologies to everyone else for that rant.",9,22,31,2 January 2003
Over the Top," Unbelievable (and I don't mean that in a good way)
","OK. I have seen some movies where the setup is so predictable, but this movie was just rediculous. Father (Stallone) gets custody of son when wife dies. He's a trucker and needs a new truck to support the family as an independent trucker. What does he do? Enter the dark and underhanded world of the World Arm Wrestling Championship. The prize, money and a New Truck.Yeah, there's also the plot about gaining the son's respect, but IMHO it was treated more as a subplot than winning the truck. That's where the movie failed. I mean, not all arm wrestlers are truckers, and I think its kind of presumptuous to have a truck as a prize. Forget having the blasted truck as a prize. It just becomes so obvious a plot device that it's disgusts me. Of course the baddies don't want Stallone to get the truck. I mean, come on!You want to see the clash of blue collar dad and white collar kid, there are far better movies out there. However, if you love bad movies, well, you may give this a turn because there's a lot to make fun of here.",3,2,6,1 November 2003
The Grapes of Wrath," A work of art
","Yes, it's a book I think we all had to read in a High school English class, but that doesn't mean it's bad.This movie was used in a sociology class I took in college, and I instantly fell in love with it. It's a great story, with a great cast. It's a bit dated in it's style, but it really overcomes it's shortcomings. Check it out!",9,2,4,19 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," So Close to greatness.....
","Perhaps some minor spoilers, but nothing really earth shattering, especially if you watched any commercials or prevues.Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent movie. I saw it on opening Morning (12:01 AM Thursday). It really brings the series back to life. However there are certain unexplained things (or perhaps I'm stupid) that annoyed me with this movie relating to the future Uncle Owen (who we meet in this movie).Also, this is (if I recall correctly) the longest movie by 13 minutes. That was 13 minutes too much romance. OK, they wanted to make a point with Annakin and Padme. They could of done it without so many long drawn out scenes (well, they felt that way to me, I didn't time them, but I may just do that next viewing).Take that away, and a very limited appearance by Jar Jar (whom I want to make Tar Tar), and the rest of the movie is a 10! Great story, action, some nice mis-direction, and above all 2 of the coolest fight scenes ever in Jedi History!!!!!!! You will never look at Yoda the same way again... YODA RULES!!!!!!!",9,0,1,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Lots of disappointments
","OK. I am a huge fan of the books. That's the main reason I have to say to anyone else who loves the books as much as I that they changed WAY TOO MUCH!. I don't want to give spoilers, but critical character development points in the story are altered, and change the feel drastically.
That being said, the movie is brilliant, with fantastic cinematography. Hey, just cause it's not as good as the books doesn't mean it's not worth seeing. It's still a good ride in spite of their changes.",9,0,0,17 January 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," HUGE LETDOWN
","I need to be very careful not to give away anything, but I will state what I feel the major failings are:1) From Edge of Realism to Comic Book. The thing I loved about the first 2 movies was even though much of it was unbelievable, there was quite a bit of tension and realism to the characters and chases. The problem was that T2 pushed the limits. They decided to go farther, and it just became rediculous. Most of the chases I found myself laughable they were so silly.2) Too Many rules changed. If you watch T1 and T2 before T3, you will see exactly what I mean by the way the T-101 acted, especially, since it's not supposed to be the same as from the prior movie(s).3) The theme changed. I feel like the story was going one way in the first 2 movies, and they completely changed their minds as to what to do.Now, I don't want to say the story was without merit and the ending wasn't good, but it was executed and designed POORLY. It feels more like 'let's revive the Terminator movie just to make it' rather than 'now, how do we pull it all together?'.I think perhaps another 6 months to 1 year to work on the storyboarding and scripting was needed to make this a really good movie, because if this was the first movie, there would NEVER EVER EVER been even a snowflake's chance in hell on the hottest day of the year while sitting in an over set to 5,000,000 F all day for a sequel, let alone anyone caring about it.James Cameron, WHY DID YOU LET THEM DO THIS TO YOUR MOVIE???!!!!! I DON'T CARE IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, YOU SHOULD OF DONE SOMETHING TO HAVE SAVED THIS MOVIE FROM WHAT HAPPENED!",6,0,0,3 July 2003
Remember the Titans," Good Movie
","It's a good movie that shows the prevalence of racism still present in the early 70's, and how ignorance makes matters worse. It was when everyone got together and learned from each other that the gaps were bridged, and sometimes, the prices that need to be paid along the way to bridge the gap, but the ultimate profit that can be earned.In the tradition of Song of the South, It is the youth who see things clearly the easiest, and it isn't until tragedy strikes home that some of the adults begin to wake up. OK. The little kids still had some problems, but mostly overcame. Others ride the wave of glory to acceptance. Unlike Song of the South, not everyone can overcome the blinders of racism. It's very real, and perhaps that's it's strength.Once you see the politics of this movie, you will never look at High School football the same way again. Oh, don't forget. This story is based on what really happened in the 1971 Titan football season.",7,0,0,17 February 2002
Man on the Moon," A Good Role for Carey, and a surprisingly good movie
","Nothing really to spoil here.Jim Carey and Andy Kaufman in someways are similar. Both were over the top. And, in some ways, it's dangerous. However, Jim threw himself into Andy's head, and at some times I think he was possessed. At some times, Jim tended to play 'Andy the Character' as opposed to 'Real Andy', though who really knows what that was.I wish they would have had Jim play Andy a bit more straight when he was off-stage in private, though it's quite possible this is not a far stretch from reality. In many ways, Andy's private image has remained an enigma to the public, but I suppose Andy would want it that way, and would rather be portrayed a bit more over the top in 'private' than he may have been.Of course, with Kaufman, this eventually backfired on him when he was suffering from cancer and the world thought it was a joke (Jim hasn't blurred the line like Andy did).Historically, they got a lot out of sequence (again, for dramatic purposes). Still, it was pretty nice, and I was pleased with how it told the story. The acting was solid, and Danny DeVito was interesting to see as his manager (since we see most of the rest of the TAXI cast in it as well as themselves). And this movie just reminds us that whether you belive Andy is alive or dead, the fact it is questioned to this day by some people, he truly has had the last laugh.",7,0,0,22 February 2002
The Princess Bride," The 'Ultimate' Movie
","OK. Understand. I don't think this is the greatest movie of all time. However, I think it's a great movie that has achieved the perfect balance for everyone to watch (9 of 10). It's clean enough for kids, exciting, romantic, and action-packed. This, wrapped around a cloak of humor, and you have a movie for almost any occasion.This is a movie the whole family can sit down and watch, and everyone can enjoy itI like to call this the perfect date movie. It's romantic enough for the women, and action-filled enough for the guys. And Besides, it's got Andre the Giant (who doesn't love him - he doesn't need to act... he just has fun and it shows)And best of all, when the person you care for who's watched it with you asks you to do something, there is nothing better than responding to them 'As you wish'.
Few movies achieve such a nice balance. GO and enjoy this movie with the people you care about the most.",9,2,4,16 February 2002
Seabiscuit," Great movie, HORRIFIC EDITING
","I heard great things about this movie before seeing it. I was looking forward to a classic telling of a real story. It was there, but seriously marred.The editing is the worst thing I have seen in years on a movie that is considered classic, let alone Oscar-worthy!Now, the story was well told, and the acting, cinematography and directing was great, but watching it was like watching a classic movie that someone took an axe to just to shorten it for the theaters. I felt that the transitions were inconsistent. Sometimes they were smooth, and others they were so abrupt, it left my head spinning wondering how we got to the next scene.I really hope that there is another more complete cut of the movie with much better transitions.As much as I love everything else about the movie, I have a hard time recommending it because of the sloppy edit job. It really detracted from my enjoyment of the film. As a result, I just don't see this movie as being as great as everyone else.",6,1,2,29 January 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," ST:TMP Meets Kung Fu
","Let me explain. It seems that this movie spent all it's time dreaming up phenominal effects, but left out one key piece of the film... The Story! There is an interlude of about 30 minutes during a flashback in the desert where no special effects are used, and the story is captivating. The rest of the time, it was forgotten.If you remember Star Trek, The Motion Picture, you will recall long drawn out scenes of special effects for no purpose other than to have fancy special effects. This movie suffers the same fate.If you want to see high-flying Kung Fu with a story, watch almost anything by Jackie Chan, or Chow Yun-Fat's other movies like 'Once Upon a Time in China'... If you want to see incredible special effects, then see this. There is no other real reason to watch it.I would love for them to do the desert story as a full-length feature. It was the only moment of great character development and story in the whole movie.",4,0,0,17 February 2002
Men in Black II," Lame - as in Search for Spock Lame
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS, not that anyone should care..... it's so LAME.As far as sequels go, this movie may just be the death nail for MIB. I am a huge fan, but the story was so contrived and LAME when it came to bringing Tommy Lee Jones back in. I would of been happier to see him not get his memory back and have to be retrained rather than the forced plot of half the movie being that. Would of been far better.The only other sequel I have found this contrived is Star Trek III - the Search for Spock (or search for a plot as I like to call it).What a shame. The first movie was so awesome, this is a complete letdown.",4,0,1,19 November 2002
The Evil Dead," Not there yet
","This is the first movie in the series, and it falls flat. It's medicore for horror, and not very funny. Still, there is some good suspense.In spite of that, I enjoy this movie. It's the birth of the group that would bring us Hercules and Xena, and would bring Bruce Campbell into fame.",5,0,4,20 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Not resting on their laurels
","I must say the Harry Potter franchise is earning it's right to be a franchise. A fairly intelligent story, though not as many clues early on to help you solve the mystery - though perhaps on DVD review I may change my mind. Most people who go to see this movie probably know the story already (as this is a very popular novel series), but without having read the books I still find it wonderfully entertaining.",8,0,0,18 November 2002
Hercules," Possibly the only Disney animated feature I HATE
","This movie, IMHO, is AWFUL! I have been a huge Disney animation fan. I'm a huge Jazz and R&B fan (and in fact, love all music styles). I generally like how Disney tells a story. This fails in all 3 counts. The music is either dull or totally annoying. The Animation is what I can best describe as 'experimental New wave', and is visually annoying (Pokemon has better animation). Lastly, the story is totally destroyed. Not one real toe-tapper you could walk away from the movie singing.I have been converting all of my Disney animated videos to DVD as they have come out. All videos, but one, and I'm thinking of dumping it anyway.",1,7,25,14 December 2002
Thirteen Days," Is Costner out of his league or what?
",Oh brother. I have seen better acting (overall) in a grade-school play. It's the return of the Bostonian's from Australia as Coster et all destroy any semblence of seriousness for such a difficult moment in history. It's sad when a dramatic moment comes up and you laugh at the way people are talking. I know how Kennedy talked. I lived up in that area for many years. The accent would be laughable if not so sad.A movie isn't always as good (or bad) as it's weakest link. But when the link is so obvious.... MST3K would reject this movie it's so bad.,1,3,16,9 June 2002
Windtalkers," It was ok, but I was Disappointed
","This looked like a very interesting and good movie. However, I felt somewhat let down. It wasn't as good as I thought it could of been. I think more could of been done to express the internal conflicts that were going on. I didn't feel the relationships developed well as expressed in the movie. The story was there. Everything was there to make it a phenomenal movie. I just feel the execution to put it on the screen fell far short of the potential.",5,1,1,14 December 2002
