E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The best movie of all time
","The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was around four years old and I loved it.  However, it wasn't until I saw it again, when I was fifteen, that I fully understood it.  Along with movies such as Hitchcock's Psycho, Speilberg has created a masterpiece constructed around a simple story line.  The cinematography in this film is remarkable and the symbolism is clever.  Notice how the film has a biblical theme and it makes the statement that God and human should be at peace.  The rainbow at the end symbolises this.  Also the film bases itself on the fact that adults fear and are hostile (i.e. prejudice) to the unknown, but children are less.  Also, the camera is often shot at a low level to represent the height of children.The performance of the actors is clearly an excellence.  At such a young age Drew Barrymore was so natural and innocent.  The audience laughs with her and at six years old this is remarkable.  What is a strength about this film is that regardless of age everyone can love it.  Although little kids don't fully appreciate the themes they can be easily captivated by the fantasy.  Adults can learn from this film and see the light hearted side too.  This film, which was went to be a small time project, has not only continued to entertain audiences 20 years on it was also the foundation for one of the best, most talented actresses of today (Drew Barrymore).",Null,0,0,3 August 2001
Psycho," The best horror movie of all time
","Nowadays we have been exposed to scarier horror and macabre to find Hitchcock's classic frightening.  However, there are certain elements which make this film the best horror movie of all time.Considering the era (1960) Hitchcock used innovative camera angles to build up the tension and fear in Psycho.  For example at the beginning the camera pans down on the motel giving the impression that the house is watching the motel.  This personification (that the house is alive) is used again when Marion's sister (Lila) approaches the house near the end.  The camera changes from objective to subjective numerous times to give the impression that the house is watching Lila.  More camera actions which are innovative is when Bates and Crane are talking over supper.  The low camera angle gives the impression that Norman Bates is bigger and therefore more menacing. This is an early indication of the horror which is to come. These are just examples of the clever use of camera.The music and lightening is a major strength of the film.  For example when there is the scene with the corpse the mummified mother is a mixture of dark and light.  This represents the good and evil side of Norman.  Moreover, there is light shining at the backs of the eye sockets which makes the corpse appear alive.  Hitchcock innovated with the signature tune ('screeching violins') and that builds up the suspense.  Such directors as Speilberg have copied this idea (e.g. Jaws)Symbolism is a good part of this film.  For example Bates has an unusual hobby of stuffing birds.  By analyzing Anthony Perkins performance he perches on the edge of his chair as if he is a bird seeking his prey (i.e. Crane).  He also acts like a bird when he twitches his head from time to time.  Another clever use of symbolism is when Lila picks up the book in the Psycho house.  She is unsure which side is what as they are equally patterned.  This represents Norman's character; you can't determine his side as he has two personalities. More symbolism is Marion's change in underwear when she packs her case; white represents purity and black represents evil/wrong doing.  Symbolism like this is also used when the camera shows the stuffed bird towering over Bates when he becomes uneasy with Marion's conversation.  This represents his mother watching over him and changing his personality.  By watching the film other examples of symbolism can be depicted throughout.What made Psycho so remarkable at the time was realism.  The setting was a realistic place and familiar to American and worldwide audiences (i.e the motel, the city - Phoenix, Arizona) rather than fictional places like Transylvania.  Also, Norman had a medical condition (he was a psychopath). This was a breakaway from the previous unrealistic films, such as Dracula. This made the film even more frightening and people were scared that such events could occur with 'real' people.  Also what was realistic about this film was that the characters were neither 'goodies' or 'baddies' - they had transformations.  Marion was a mixture of good and bad (the color of her underwear she chooses represents this and the color of the car she buys.) This makes the film more realistic as it shows that people all have good and bad in them, which is true.Moreover what stood out in the film was what happened to Janet Leigh.  She was killed of very early into the film and this shocked audiences that the A-list Hollywood actress was so brutally murdered.  This is nearly on a par with what Drew Barrymore chose to do for Scream when she chose to be Casey. This fact shows Hitchcock has influenced the thinking for other horror movies.Therefore, although you will be better of with Scream or Scary Movie to scare you this film is an example of cinematography at its best.",Null,2,4,4 August 2001
The Wedding Singer," Great chemistry
","Like most people would agree Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore had great chemistry in this movie.  They should consider teaming up for another movie.  However, they were two different people so people who hate Sandler's humor can appreciate Barrymore's acting (and vice versa).The only annoying thing about this movie is that I was relatively young in the 80's and can't really appreciate or recognize the music/dress.  However, this film has steadily made me a fan of the 80's music.  Sandler was great as the singer and he made the cheesy music come alive.This film, along with Ever After (1998), firmly placed how good an actress Barrymore is.  Previously, as an adult star, she was perceived as the B-Movie Bad Girl who landed obnoxious roles, which fell on line with the publics image of her.  However, her role as Julia is far different and shows that Barrymore is versatile; she can act in different roles and she maybe isn't such a bad ass but a working actress.It's a chick flick, but guys take some hints and compose a goofy, romantic song for your lady - they'll love it.10/10",Null,1,1,3 August 2001
