3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma
",Excellent movie love it! I'm just wondering if it will be nominated for any Oscar titles. I have a certain website on Oscar critics votes on a website and if you want them comment on this. The critics (25) say that sound editing can be the only win for 3:10 to yuma but I hope it gets more don't you agree? It is a must see from 2007. The movies that I predict for Oscars I'm going along with the actors and critics here. Best Picture Is probably going to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN Best Actor well it looks like a tie for Geogre Clooney of Daniel Day Lewis it'll be close Actress no doubt in my mind Jule Christe will pull it out sound editing 3:10 to YUma the long shot but if it's nominated i'm shooting for that sup. actress Cate Blanchett be careful with Amy Ryan thought sound mixing Transformers or The Bourne Ultimatum but transformers gets the nod visual effects Transformers not evan almighty sup. actor Javier Bardem his performance is Oscar worthy the critics agree,10,2,6,21 January 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park Bigger, Longer, and Unneeded
",Filthy Junk put on screen. Horrible and I hope everyone reads this who has seen this movie Wwast totally unneeded. Trey Parker is worse than Stanley Kubrick's movie A Clockwork Orange. Perverted and disgusting to the mind who ever made this up should repent hundreds of times before they die. I mean making the devil win is the last thing you would want to happen I could go on and on and on and on and on about how Filthy piece of I can't even say it than I'd be turning into you and making my own movie is put into this world. It's not funny it's disgusting trey parker I am not laughing to your stupid crap. Please stop your ruining your life.,8,1,2,15 June 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Incredible!
",Yeah! Finally after the Temple of Doom we get a descent Indiana Jones film. I loved this movie the casting was awesome. Sean Connery was a perfect choice for Indy's Dad he was hilarious! Honestly I thought this movie would suck but it turns out I was wrong. When I saw this in theaters I was amazed. Steven Spielberg has his ups and downs but in the case it was not one of them. I laughed and enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it. Why wasen't this up for Visual Effects! C'mon it deserved a nominee. Well I think that raps in up. Congratulations! Also if you haven't seen this yet by all means this is the next movie on your rentals list.,9,0,1,1 April 2008
