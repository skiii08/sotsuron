Vertigo," An Excellent Movie Which Everyone Should View
","Hitchcock really proves that he is the best and most popular director with this film as it one of the best movies ever. The movie starts out intriguing and when the main plot twist occurs, you are left breathless and thinking you're in a completely different movie with a different plot. Watch This one as it is a great motion picture and will leave you astounded.",9,4,4,14 July 2000
