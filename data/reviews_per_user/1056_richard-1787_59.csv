The King's Speech," A very fine movie
","This is one of the best movies I've seen in several years. It tells a moving story in a moving but never sentimental way. I was never bored for one instant. The acting is uniforming superlative. Colin Firth makes you feel Bertie's shame and anger at not being able to speak forcefully, not being able to do what his father, especially, but also his brother do so well, complicated by the fact that he has been raised never to express his feelings. If he doesn't get at least an Academy Award nomination for this role, I will be surprised and very much disgusted. Geoffrey Rush is funny but imposing as the speech therapist who has his own unsuccessful aspirations. The actor who plays Churchill SOUNDS like Churchill.But this is basically a two-man show, like Amadeus, which its use of Mozart recalls to mind on occasion. And, as with Amadeus, both actors are completely up to the task.My only criticism, and it is a mild one, is that Bertie comes off as a rather weak individual, though various characters keep saying that is is strong. I think it would have helped if, early in the movie, we had been given a few instances of his strength and perseverance. All we see is a man who is terrified of speaking into a microphone who cries a lot.But that is very minor indeed.To me, this is very definitely a 10. A movie that could be seen more than once with a great deal of enjoyment.",10,1,2,28 December 2010
Vertigo," An astounding movie in which James Stewart plays a monster
","This is a truly astounding movie. It is so suspenseful I found it impossible to leave the room once it got going. There is no horror, no blood, no monsters threatening to jump out at you from dark corners. But between Hitchcock's masterful set up of each shot, the almost blood-chilling acting of James Stewart playing against type, the fear on Kim Novak's cold but very beautiful face, and Bernard Hermann's score, which heightens the tension in almost unbearable fashion, this movie moves slowly and carefully to its conclusion, never once letting you go.And then, for me, it dropped the ball from the top of the church tower and closed on a wrong note.---------- Spoiler ---------------------- Not that I wanted a 'happy end' with Stewart forgetting all the pain he had been put through and marrying Novak. No, that would have been equally wrong. But Novak falling to her death because she is afraid of the person in the nun's outfit just did not work for me.I don't know what would have worked better, though.Still, it is an astounding movie. If you haven't seen it, treat yourself.",10,4,6,1 January 2017
Black Swan," Not what I expected
","If I had known before I went to see this movie that the director had also directed Pi, I might have passed on it. Having now seen it, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed the experience, or that I am likely to remember the movie a week from now.For whatever reason I expected a movie about the difficult real life of a ballet dancer. And that was, sort of, what this turned out to be.But, more and more, it also turned out to be a horror movie, the modern versions of which do nothing for me and I avoid. The leading character, Nina, suffers from what appear to be hallucinations. As a result, you can't tell when something is actually happening and when she is just hallucinating it.Of course, if the purpose of the movie is to convey what she perceives and feels, I guess the distinction doesn't really matter.Once I accepted that stance, I found that, since I didn't care for the main character at all and definitely did not identify with her, I really didn't care about anything. I didn't care whether her colleagues were really out to get her, or if she was just extremely paranoid and imagined it all, or some part of it.And that pretty much sums up my reaction to this movie. I didn't care, and I was happy when it was over, as I don't much care to be manipulated by horror scenes.Those that do enjoy that might enjoy this. Who knows?",2,17,54,19 December 2010
Frost_Nixon," Better than I expected
","I haven't (yet) seen the play on which this movie is based, so I can't say whether it's faithful to it, better, worse, different, etc. All I know is the movie, which I just saw in the theater.It was a little disconcerting for me at first, as I kept seeing David Frost in terms of former Prime Minister Tony Blair (because the actor who plays Frost played Blair in The Queen). That's not the movie's fault, but it definitely skewed how I first saw Frost, i.e., I didn't see him as the largely frivolous man that contemporary viewers were used to seeing - even though the movie did a good job of presenting that aspect of Frost's career at that point.It also took me a little time to get used to Langella as Nixon. Because he doesn't look like Nixon, I at first saw a bad impressionist doing Nixon. Again, that wasn't the movie's fault. Langella doesn't try to do an impression of Nixon. But it took me awhile to see him as Nixon. Once my mind made that shift, my involvement very much changed.For the better. This movie gets better and better as it goes on. Once it gets to the preparations for the final interview, it really becomes a first-rate movie. By the end, I was very moved. Which surprised me. I didn't feel at all sorry for Nixon, nor did I feel any great joy at Frost's eventual success. The movie doesn't try to make you cheer for the latter or weep for the former. Rather, I had a feeling of sadness at seeing what a deeply flawed person Nixon turns out to be, and the thought that such a man led our nation, and mislead it, with that flaw.It's definitely a movie worth seeing. It might be better watching it at home, as the first part may not hold you and being at home would give you a chance to get up to go to the kitchen for something, etc. But once the preparation for the final interview begins, you will be happy you rented it, and won't have any desire to take a break.",7,1,3,1 March 2009
The Monuments Men," Not a great movie, but still worth seeing for the story - because the book on which it is based does not tell one story
","This movie got a poor review in the Cleveland paper from a reviewer I trust. Still, the subject interested me, and I've seen George Clooney directed movies that I loved, like 'Good Night and Good Luck,' so I went anyway.This is not another 'Good Night and Good Luck. The cast is impressive, but the script doesn't build any tension until near the end, by which time it is too late.Comparison to John Frankenheimer's 'The Train' is inevitable, and not flattering. In that movie, the defense of art is given to the curator of the Jeu de paume museum - Cate Blanchett's character here - and not to an American. Indeed, the American in Frankenheimer's movie, Burt Lancaster's character, can't buy her argument. The French curator argues that the art must be saved because it is part of French national culture, because it expresses what the French have been. (The script of *The Train* was adapted from *The Art Front*, the memoires of Rose Valland, the woman who had worked in the Jeu de pomme museum during the Occupation.) Here it is an American who argues the importance of art in general, and that it very different.His argument is much more universal, which is to say that art is where man has been in the past. That's true, of course, but much less gut-wrenching, less immediate, less concrete. The French curator in 'The Train' explains how so much else has been taken away from the French during the Occupation; they cannot allow their art, who they have been and therefore part of who they are now, to be taken away as well. The threat presented through George Clooney's character to FDR is less immediate. If the Germans take this art, nothing will happen to Americans and their culture in particular. It very much speaks to the different role art plays in American culture, as opposed to some European and Asian cultures.This difference is brought out by the art that gets named in each movie. In 'The Train,' the curator of the Jeu de paume lists the French painters whose works the Germans are about to remove from Paris. In 'Monuments Men,' the work that gets the greatest attention is a Michelangelo statue, a work of Italian art, that is in a Belgian church, i.e., not a work of art that grew out of and expressed Belgian culture. That lack of understanding of the importance of national art to certain European cultures is a definite weakness in this movie. We only get the American perspective.You see that at the very end. When the mission is over, FDR asks the leader, Clooney's character: 'In the future, will anyone care that you risked and gave your lives to save this art?' After that question, we suddenly jump to the future and see Clooney's American art historian character, now elderly, pay a visit to the Michelangelo Madonna that he and his men saved during the war. It's all well and good that the statue should be appreciated by a Harvard art historian. But it would have been much more moving if we had seen locals moved by the sacrifice of these Americans to preserve a part of their art/culture, say the altarpiece that was also saved and that is presented as the essence of Medieval European culture. (Though it is really, at most, an expression of Northern European Medieval culture.)The end of Frankenheimer's movie also asks the question 'Is art worth losing men's lives to save it?', but without providing a clear answer. The last shots, of dead Frenchmen on the ground and then the crates of art the Nazis tried to take back to Germany, present both sides of the argument and refuse to settle it. At the end of this movie, George Clooney's character gives a speech to FDR that provides a positive answer, and it isn't questioned. One is left with the impression that these men risked their lives to save this art because it is important to them and other art historians. Again, there is no connection with a national culture.Still, this movie is worth seeing. Though I suspect you would be better off reading the book of the same name on which it is named.-------------------------------Having now read that book, I repeat that, if you want to know what actually happened, you would be better off reading the book.However, the movie, I now see, does a remarkable job of drawing a coherent story out of what is a very diffuse tome that would have profited from a LOT of editing. The book tries to create tension and suspense at certain points, but does a poor job of it. It also follows a lot of different threads, but does a poor job of linking them. In short, the book, at over 400 pages, is only for those who really want to know about the history behind this.If you want a story on this topic, settle for the movie.",5,1,2,15 February 2014
Casablanca," The Great American Movie - historical context
","I don't know how many times I've seen this movie. A lot, because every time it's on TV and I start to watch it, I can't stop. It is, indeed, the great American movie.Other reviewers have offered reasons why it's so great. There's no point in my going over all that.What I thought I would add here is the historical context.Rick makes it clear, in his scene with Sam, that the movie takes place in December, 1941. At that point the U.S. had not yet entered the war, though of course it would on the seventh of that month when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.By the time the movie was released in November, 1942, however, the U.S. had not only entered the war but invaded North Africa, successfully. Whereas the prefect, Louis Renault (Claude Rains), still acknowledges the Germans in December, 1941, as a good employee of Pétain's far-right dictatorship, by the time the movie opened, at the end of 1942, the French in North Africa were quickly siding with the Allies. Curtiz foreshadows this brilliantly at the end in one of the many famous scenes when Renault, rather than turning Rick in for killing the German Major Strasser, diverts the police and throws a bottle of Vichy water (Vichy was the capital of the Pétainist government) in the trash.American audiences therefore had the advantage of seeing this story with the hindsight of current events, a knowledge that the Renaults of Northern Africa would, indeed, ignore the Germans and side with the Americans.But they also knew that the outcome of the war was still undecided. D-Day, the June, 1944 invasion, was still far in the future. In November, 1942, the Germans would not have looked at all funny to them, but very real and very dangerous.",10,1,3,11 September 2016
To Be or Not to Be," A remarkable movie
","Actors and actresses are remembered for their performances of the great classics, in anglophone culture usually Shakespeare. And yet, as many an actor has said, the only thing harder to do than great tragedy is great comedy.And the only thing harder than that is a convincing mixture of both.And that is what this movie is.There are a lot of Lubitsch comedies that I can watch over and over, especially those he did with Jeannette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier. It mixes the most serious tragedy with the cleverest comedy, taking you from one to the other flawlessly.There is nothing funny about Felix Bressart's delivery of Shylock's speech; his character has every reason to believe he may be killed by the gestapo. It is deeply moving.Yet there is nothing funnier than when a young man walks out on Joseph Tura's/Jack Benny's 'To be or not to be' soliloquy.I've seen this movie several times. I marvel at it every time. It is by turns deeply moving and wonderfully funny. It is, indeed, one wonderful movie.",10,1,3,28 June 2014
Darkest Hour," A remarkable movie
","It's inevitable that this movie will be mentioned with the summer blockbuster *Dunkirk*, since some of it deals with setting up the evacuation of British troops from that French port. You could say that this movie provides the background for *Dunkirk*, and that it does. But it also provides so much more.While *Dunkirk* was a remarkable example of visual pyrotechnics, planes fighting, ships being blown up, etc., this is a remarkable example of human emotions facing crisis. Nothing blows up, except Churchill's temper. It is really almost a one-man show, in fact, because it spends most of its time focusing on what the Prime Minister went through emotionally and intellectually as he faced the crisis of the German invasion of Holland, Belgium, and France in May 1940, and the collapse of the combined Allied forces in that area that followed in the next several weeks. (No, by the way, the German forces did NOT outnumber the Allies, nor were they better equipped. The characters in the movie who say that may have believed it, but we now know that it was not true. It was just that the Germans were better strategists than the Allies.)Gary Oldman is remarkable as Churchill. He shows the outer bluster, but also the inner uncertainties, the hesitations, the fear of repeating the terrible World War I mistake at Gallipoli. This is a very complex character, brought to life in what is certainly an Academic-Award-worthy performance.None of the other characters, with the partial exception of Churchill's wife, is given anything like that attention. We don't learn why Chamberlain and Hallifax wanted appeasement, though it had failed repeatedly before. We don't learn why King George VI took a long time to come over to Churchill's side, and why he did. This is strictly a one-character character portrayal. But it is very well done and, by the end, profoundly moving.For myself I have no reservations about this movie. I don't know that I've ever given a 10 before, but this movie deserved one for me. Viewers who have not studied this part of World War II may not follow all that is going on, however, so for some parts of it may be difficult to follow. Then again, millions who knew nothing about this period went to see *Dunkirk* and enjoyed it, so that may not really matter. As I said, a deeply moving film.",10,1,7,24 December 2017
The Fan," This is a difficult movie to watch
","This is a difficult movie for me to watch. Not because of the acting. de Niro, a fine actor, gives a fine performance. But it is of a very sick person.Nor do I care to watch movies in which children are threatened.So what, then, was the point in making this movie, which tells the story of a very disturbed individual, de Niro's character, who goes from being a bad father to his own son to a kidnapper and terrorist of the son of a baseball player whom he idolizes. (Why does he idolize Snipes' character? We never really know.) It's all very exploitative. Some fine actors wasted on an exploitative script.I sat through it once. But I would never recommend it to anyone, despite de Niro's fine acting, nor would I ever sit through it again.I just don't see the point in making a movie like this. Who would get any pleasure out of it?",4,1,4,14 February 2014
Zootopia," An anti-Trump, anti-Cruz, anti-Rubio, anti-fear mongering movie
","The first half of this movie is pretty much Disney-by-the-numbers. The little bunny who dreams of being a police officer fights prejudice triggered by her diminutive size and timid race. (The other police officers are all large, ferocious animals like lions and tigers and bears and even rhinoceroses.) Her parents try to convince her to stick with what they and their family have always done, but she refuses to buy into their complacency. Others make fun of her because she's a rabbit. Etc.The scene at the DMV where it turns out that the clerks are all sloths had the adults in the audience, including myself, laughing out loud, though the little children had no idea why their parents were laughing.But then, when we finally start to understand what is behind the disappearance of the 12 predators - is it 12 by chance, I wonder? - that there has been an attempt to seize political power in the city by ramping up one group's fear of another group based on supposed racial character traits, this movie moves from the pleasant world of Disney animation to the current political scene. There is no attempt to make any group of animals look like Muslims, or Mexicans, or ..., nor any of the fear-mongers look like Trump or Cruz or ..., but you'd have to be a 6 year old not to see what the movie is trying to say. Suddenly it is speaking to the parents who dutifully brought their kids to yet another Disney animated movie, not to sell them merchandise but to wake them up to the current political scene.Do the parents see that the movie is now talking to them, about now? I don't know. But when the Fox, to prove his point, suddenly pretends to attack Judy Rabbit and Judy goes for her fox repellent even though the Fox has become her good friend - or has he? - you are forced to come to terms with the fact that, even behind most of our pc verbiage a socially-instilled fear of others who are different is still in us, and can be exploited by those who want to use us to gain power for themselves.I have no idea what the little children in the audience today came away with. To judge from their restlessness as the movie went on and became more serious, perhaps not a lot.But the parents who were able to keep watching in between trying to keep their little ones still might, at least for a moment, have gotten a rather remarkable reflection on the current presidential race.Going back to such early feature-length movies as *Bambi*, the Disney Studios have often found some of their best material in the things that really frighten us. Not cheap horror fear, but deep-down fears that reside inside us. Bambi's mother warned her young child to beware the hunters because they were a real source of danger, and that masterpiece made them terrifying though it never showed them to us - or perhaps because it never showed them to us. This Disney picture warns us, too, about another sort of danger. The fear is of a different kind, but no less menacing.",7,3,17,6 March 2016
42," Not a great movie, but a thoroughly engaging and very fine one
","100 years from now, or 50, or perhaps even 25, film courses that cover great American movies from the first part of the 21st century probably will not talk about '42.' There is no innovative photography or methods of telling the story - it's pretty much 'first A, then B, then C, then...' in chronological order, etc. The acting ranges from good - Harrison Ford makes Branch Rickey into a stereotypical old codger - to very good: Chadwick Boseman is very moving as Robinson, and makes him a very real individual, unlike Ford's caricature Rickey. But there is nothing really innovative about the movie-making.There are times when the dialogue is too obvious, usually in the noble moments, and the music wells up as it does in noble moments in a thousand movies, TV programs, and television ads.But all that said and granted, this is still one very enjoyable movie, especially the scenes on the field. The baseball games come alive, especially because Boseman is so engaging as Robinson on the field. Extremely talented, and very engaging. You don't have to be a baseball fan, or indeed know much about the game, to enjoy them, especially when Robinson is taunting the pitcher stealing bases.There are other moments in the movie when a little outside knowledge would add to the impact, such as knowing who 'Happy,' the baseball commissioner, was (Happy Chandler, a former governor of Kentucky), but you can still have a great time without it.Definitely a movie to see in the theater, so you can hear the sound of others laughing at some of the great humor.A movie doesn't have to be a timeless example of film making in order to be a very enjoyable one.---------------------------------------I enjoyed this movie in the theater when it was first released. Now that it has been released on DVD and I was able to rent it at my local Redbox, I got to see it again, and enjoyed it even more than the first time.Chadwick Boseman's performance as Robinson is truly first-rate. But the script is not far behind him: this very intelligent and very effective script really makes you feel something of what Robinson must have gone through at the time. Terrible stuff, but it makes you feel it, to at least a degree of what he must have felt. (The scenes with the Philadelphia manager will make your skin crawl, but you'll rejoice at the end of the movie when you learn that that hateful Phily manager never went any further in baseball.) This is not a 'feel good' movie. It's much better than that. It's a remarkable testament to two very strong and strong-willed individuals who took a lot of s**t to do what they felt was right.And it makes one hell of a good story.",8,0,1,14 April 2013
12 Angry Men," A masterpiece
","The script of this movie was nominated for an Academy award. Why it didn't win it I don't know. Why it didn't win 10, or 100, or 1000 Academy Awards for the writing I don't know either. It is the most gripping script I have ever seen, and I have seen it several times.Even the best script needs good actors and a good director to have its potential realized. In this case, there were no impediments to that realization. There is not a weak link in the 12 actors chosen to play the jurors. Every one of them is perfect, every one of them gives a masterful performance.And they work together to create a masterpiece because the director did a masterful job of making this movie build to an unforgettable but completely motivated climax.Never in the history of Hollywood has a movie that cost so little to make been so great.=========================================Added 2 February, 2014:There are few movies I will watch more than once. There are even fewer movies that I will not interrupt when my stomach tells me it is time for dinner. This is one of those few. TCM ran it again this evening, and once I saw it on, I couldn't stop watching until the end.There is more great acting in this movie, and more great direction, than in a dozen other 'great' movies. It's all great performances and brilliant camera angles to drive them home. A masterpiece.My question at the end, however: what happened in the life of the character played by Lee J. Cobb (spectacular performance) that caused him to hate the accused so?=========================================Added 21 July, 2019:I watched this movie again last night, and again was held riveted to my chair. Since I only see it once every few years, when I catch it on TCM, I forget the small but crucial details and so rediscover them again with the characters as the drama unfolds.This time, as I watched Fonda's and some of the other characters start to raise questions about the testimony of the old man and the woman across the street, I kept thinking: 'But why didn't the public defender raise those issues?' And then I thought: but I didn't think of them the first time around, so why should he have? Among many other things, this movie shows that even without malice aforethought, a trial may not always defend those who cannot pay for a high-priced attorney to defend them.It also reminds us of an era not so long ago when men could speak truly hateful lines about minorities, or seniors, or ..., without any real fear of public shaming. It is not until the very end that Ed Begley's character, who seems to harbor every terrible prejudice about those different from him, is finally ostracized by most of the others for his you-name-it-phobic language. His character is the worst of the lot in that respect, but some of the others are bad as well.And there is the terrible indifference of some of the characters to the outcome of the trial, even though that outcome could be the death of a young man. At first, at least, they don't want to be bothered. Because he is different his life doesn't matter.Each of the eleven characters' road to doubt is fascinating. One I particularly noticed last night was E. G. Marshall's. His character is convinced by the facts that the young man is guilty, until finally one fact he knows from his own experience changes everything for him. He suddenly realizes he has been wrong. It is clearly painful for him to change, but change he must to be true to his image of himself.There are already over 1000 reviews of this movie here, so the chances of your seeing this one are slight. But let that number impress on you the importance of seeing this movie. Not just once, but more than once, so that you, like the characters, can start to see what lies in the little, not at first apparent details.",10,0,0,1 September 2008
The Natural," I don't get it
","This movie did nothing for me.Yes, I grant that it has a fine cast, and they all give fine performances.But the off-the-field story did nothing for me. I never understood Hobbs' attraction to Bassinger's character. I saw no chemistry there at all.It was the on-the-field story that bothered me. If you take something like 'The Stratton Story,' where you see Monty Stratton work hard to become a great ball player, you become involved in his efforts, and really root for him.But Hobbs' success is the result of magic, not any effort on his part. He says that he went 16 years without playing baseball. Yes, he 'thought about it' for those 16 years, but thinking about baseball is not working to get good at it.He hits well, sometimes, because he has a magic bat. But the bat doesn't explain how he can succeed as an outfielder, which he evidently does. We just have to believe that he suddenly can play major-league outfield. Must be niece.Sure, you feel sorry for him when he gets sick, and appreciate that he must have been in pain during that last game. But other than that, you never see him work to become a successful player. So, when it is taken away from him, it's hard to feel sorry for him.This just didn't get me involved, at all.",5,10,22,16 October 2013
Spotlight," A traditional-style movie that grows on you
","When this movie starts out, you could be forgiven for thinking that you are seeing *All the President's Men* or some other classic newspaper movie. Very much unlike *The Big Short*, for example, another of this year's feature-length films recounting a recent true story, there are no really innovative new approaches to movie making here.But that is not to say that this movie holds no interest. Not at all. Unlike any of the classic newspaper movies I know, this one gets complicated when you start to suspect that there are people in the paper itself who are working against the journalists covering the big story.You also start to wonder what involvement the journalists in question themselves may have had with similar situations, since they are all Boston Catholics themselves. Lots of old-fashioned close-ups of their faces, faces that are expressing anguished thoughts not put into words, leave you wondering. This is not like covering the Watergate break-in, you come to realize. These reporters are in fact discovering things about themselves, their upbringing, their community, as they probe ever more leads into cases of child abuse by Boston Catholic priests.There is nothing innovative about the film making here, perhaps. But the script is written for intelligent adults, and demands your full attention, which it amply rewards.This is not an easy movie to watch, frankly, because you end up viewing the case through the anguish of the reporters. In that sense, it takes the ability to see all this as new and horrifying, despite all we have learned since.But it is very much a movie that is worth the effort, and the discomfort, to watch.",10,2,4,16 January 2016
Life of Pi," Too long for me, but an extraordinarily beautiful movie
","I haven't read the book - or at least more than the first 50 pages. The cinematography in this movie is remarkably beautiful, especially the scenes on the ocean. The end makes you rethink what came before, but I don't want to ruin that for anyone.For me, this movie went on too long while Pi was at sea. But the imagery, and the imagination behind it, was truly remarkable.I don't know what this would look like watched on a home TV. I suspect it would lose a lot of its visual power. Treat yourself to it in the theater, on a day when you're relaxed. Even if there isn't much of any traditional plot, it is beautiful to watch. (Yes, I know I'm repeating myself, but I had to get this to 10 lines. My apologies.)",7,0,2,30 November 2012
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Remarkable for the creativity of the script, among other things
","I just saw this movie, and I found it remarkable. Yes, there is some very fine acting in it, which I will leave to others to praise. What I found remarkable here was the script, not the dialogues so much as the plot development. There are several surprise developments, twists and turns that catch you - or at least me - of your guard. But they never struck me as forced, they always made sense within the context of what had come before. The lead characters were allowed a complexity that I appreciated.There was one thing that left me perplexed: deputy Dixon's change of character near the end, when he decides to help the main character find her daughter's sadistic killer. Yes, I know that he is affected by the late sheriff's letter to him - did the sheriff really write all those letters before committing suicide? - but that didn't seem enough to me. I was amazed that, when Dixon finally sees the fire engulfing the police station, the one thing he wants to save is the file regarding the daughter's murder case.I'd be curious to hear how others reacted to this.",9,5,10,3 March 2018
Trouble with the Curve," This movie has everything
","This movie has everything. A first-rate script, fine acting by the leads, good directing. What more could you ask? Eastwood is first rate as an aging baseball scout who doesn't want to come to terms with the effect of aging on his body and his career.Amy Adams, in the best role I have seen her in, plays an ambitious young lawyer who is willing to put her chances for a law partnership in danger to help a father who was seldom there for her.Granted, the final minutes where Eastwood's character explains why his daughter didn't often see him when she was growing up, though realistic, still don't make him a lovable character. But life is sometimes like that.This is a first class movie all the way. It is not warm and cuddly. It has all sorts of rough edges. But it is a better movie for all that.",9,1,2,2 November 2013
Coriolanus," A remarkable achievement
","Coriolanus was one of Shakespeare's last plays, written after the masterpieces for which the world knows his name. Yet it is certainly one of his least performed and least known works.May this movie change that.This is not some 'concept' production that contorts the play into the pre-conceived notions of an egotistical director. Quite to the contrary. This is the often astounding product of a man who has thought through Shakespeare's play, seen in it what is powerful and very relevant to our own times, and brought that power out with at times almost overwhelming force. I don't know that I have ever seen a movie that boiled over with more testosterone than this one; it puts Schwarzenegger's movies to shame in that respect. Over and over I marveled at how Fienes found modern-day moments that were, in fact, modern equivalents of the scenes Shakespeare set in Classical Rome.And yet, there is the greatest respect for Shakespeare's words. They are delivered with astounding clarity, yet in such a way that they sound like almost modern speech, rather than poetry that is 400 years old. There Fienes and Vanessa Redgrave are the true stars. Their every word seems natural, yet delivered in a way that gives all the power and beauty to Shakespeare's verse.If you hated Shakespeare in high school, you need to see this movie. Trust me, this is not the Shakespeare you had foisted off on you then. This is a masterful interpretation of what has always been treated as a minor Shakespeare play, so masterful that it must make us wonder if we have been misjudging it for four centuries.",9,4,7,17 June 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," Extraordinary acting
","I've seen this movie, all or in part, I don't know how many times. It's a long movie. There are parts that are just filler.But there are also scenes in which an intelligent, nuanced, well-constructed script, delivered by truly great actors led by a great director, rises to a level that has never been surpassed, not even by Shakespeare performed by our greatest actors.I do not say this lightly.The scene where Maximillian Schell's character grills Judy Garland's character until he is finally stopped by Burt Lancaster's character, rips your heart out.Burt Lancaster's character's subsequent condemnation of himself and his fellow judges - and Germans - is good dialogue delivered with such great delivery that you truly believe you are hearing greatness. And, I guess, you are, because of how Lancaster delivers the text.Schell's character's subsequent speech arguing that Germany's guilt was a shared guilt is brilliantly written. I don't care for his delivery of it, but the text is remarkable nevertheless.Listening to great actors deliver dialogue that they can raise to the highest levels is a wonder. It makes us marvel at what is truly great acting.What a work of art!",10,0,2,19 February 2015
Dunkirk," The technique in this movie is astounding. The story, and the history, not so much.
","The most astounding thing in this movie, for me, was the cinematography. It is eye-poppingly riveting, and often very beautiful. From the early scene where we suddenly see the beaches of Dunkirk spread out before us against the brilliant blue of the sea, through many following scenes, the color and the framing of many of the scenes is truly remarkable. The cameraman clearly has a painter's eye.The action photography is also often remarkable. The filming of the dogfights, with constantly tilting cameras, gave you some idea of what it must have been like to be in those fighter planes.The various stories - on the pier, in the skies, on the small British pleasure yacht, on the sinking trawler, etc. - were sometimes juxtaposed to great effect, each one heightening the effect of the preceding one.The music - and use of sound - in the movie was also dead on, heightening the tension over and over.In short, this movie held me glued to my seat almost from the get-go.But that did not keep me from seeing the problems.The first is a matter of taste. Once the tension starts, it almost never lets up. I realize that for some viewers that's a plus. I could have used some variation.There is, for all intents and purposes, no real acting in this movie, and certainly no character development. An occasional break in the tension to develop the characters to some extent would have made the movie more interesting to me.My big issue, though, is the way this movie treats history. From the first scene on the beach, where we see the British soldiers lined up waiting to board a ship to evacuate them back to England, this movie is designed to praise the courage and calmness of the British soldier, as well as the heroism of the British civilian who sailed small boats across the Channel to save them. 300,000+ of them, in fact.What the movie simply ignores is that while Britain evacuated virtually all of its troops from Dunkirk, they did so at the expense of the French, tens of thousands of whom were left on the beaches to be captured by the Germans and spend four years rotting in POW camps in Germany. At the very end, Kenneth Branaugh's character says that he will stay 'to wait for the French,' but in fact the British did not. Once they got their own troops out, they stopped the mission.There were also certain situations that were set up just to milk the audience's emotions, such as the blinding and subsequent death of the young man on the yacht. That, to me, was manipulative.Overall, however, there is much that is impressive in this movie. It is slick, but impressively so. There's no real depth to it - you know nothing about the characters and don't have any feelings for them - and it doesn't raise any real issues to think about. The most moving moment, by far, is moving only because someone else wrote it: Churchill's great speech about how the British will go on fighting. It makes you realize that nothing else in the movie has that sort of verbal power. If you want this story treated with depth, try Mrs. Miniver. That's manipulative as well, but with far more humanity.I can't imagine watching this on a TV. It needs a big screen with vibrant color and a great sound system. But if you want to be riveted to your seat for two hours in a movie theater, you could do far worse.",7,3,7,8 September 2017
Inside Out," A remarkably innovative - and yes, thought provoking - movie
","This is not the greatest movie ever made.But it is, without question, one of the most innovative and creative.Early on I wasn't particularly impressed. But as it developed - and it most definitely developed, it didn't just move along - it became truly interesting.I can't imagine what a 10 year old child would get out of this movie.But as a 64 year old man who sees some of his memories start to vanish like that pink elephant that even joy cannot save, I found its meditation on the importance of core memories - and the problems when they are lost - to be deeply moving.One of the very best things about this movie is that the issues are not discussed to death. Sometimes you just have to draw your own conclusions from what happens. The I's are not all dotted and the T's are not all crossed. It's really a movie made for intelligent adults. If children enjoy it, so much the better.",8,4,24,27 November 2015
The Duchess," Pretty to look at
","This movie is pleasant to look at - the costumes and the sets are lavish, and would look even better if they were better lit and the lighting director didn't worry about what lighting was really like in 18th century interiors. This is a commercial movie, after all, not a BBC documentary.And the acting is all very fine. You really feel for the poor duchess, who is trapped in a prison I would not wish on any man or woman.But in the end, the problem with this movie is the script. It doesn't build to anything. Suddenly the movie is over, and I went: Oh? Each scene is fine, well-acted and well-directed. The movie has points to make and it makes them well.But there is no structure, no build. It just moves from scene to scene, with no apparent direction.A shame, as everything else was so good.",5,3,6,16 October 2008
Yesterday," So what, then, is this movie suggesting?
","We go through most of this movie believing that in the alternate universe into which the protagonist stumbles the Beatles never existed. Then, near the end, we discover that indeed they did, to the extent that their songs were written and performed in Liverpool.What are we to make of that? That it was only chance that made the Beatles a hit, and that they could have written the same material and still gone nowhere?I have no answer. The movie doesn't offer one.I much enjoyed this movie. But I wish the end had reflected at least a little on the question it raises.",7,3,9,28 June 2019
The Chorus," Not what I remembered
","I saw this movie 13 years ago when it first came out, and I remember I really loved it.Watching it tonight on TV, I didn't experience the enjoyment I remember feeling back in 2004. Part of it may have to do with the fact that the music probably made a stronger effect on me in the theater, with a more powerful sound system. Listening to it tonight though just the TV speakers, I found that, while it is beautifully sung by the boys' choir, it is basically all affect with no real substance. Compare it with that of its old American counterpart, the Bing Crosby Christmas class *Going My Way.* Anyone can remember the songs that boys' choir sings, *When you wish on a star* or even the rather bland *Going my way*. None of the music in *Les Choristes* sticks in the memory like that.The acting is certainly first-rate, starting with Gérard Jugnot, one of my favorite actors. He isn't given a lot to work with here, though. There is no real conflict in his character, nothing for the actor to work with. The school director is uniformly evil, the other characters, even the boys, without three dimensions.It's all very pleasant, certainly, and I was never bored a moment. But it all seems rather obvious. The end is strange, looked at with today's eyes. I couldn't help thinking that today Mathieu would be prosecuted for kidnapping, at the very least, and probably be held in suspicion of child molestation, which is sad and certainly not an issue in this movie. I'd have to go back and watch the beginning of the movie, the frame, again to see if there is any indication of whether Mathieu raised Pépinot.An enjoyable movie, certainly. There just isn't much to it dramatically.",7,0,0,12 November 2017
The Favourite," Don't waste your time or money on this one
","Throughout this movie characters vomit. While I wouldn't say that it will make you do the same, I certainly found it deadly dull.
And pretentious.
The story has some basis in history. It takes place near the end of the reign of England's Queen Anne, around 1711-1713, during which time the War of Spanish Succession-the war between England and France that is mentioned on occasion-was drawing near its end. The Queen's husband, Prince George of Denmark, had died in 1708, after having gotten her pregnant 17 times - enough to justify switching romantic interest away from men for any woman. Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough, who had already managed to become the Queen's friend, and-at least in this movie-something more than that as well, has come to exert real influence over the Queen because of her willingness to play to the monarch's desire for affection from other women. As the movie opens, Abigail Hill, a distant relative of Sarah's, arrives at court with the hope of getting preferment there. She sees how Sarah receives favor from the Queen, and decides that she can play that game as well if it will allow her to advance at court. Lesbian intrigue follows.
The costumes are fine, there is some intriguing lighting, and early in the movie some different types of lenses provide unusual shots. The acting, to the extent that the women in these roles get to act, is all fine.
But, for me, this was a succession of too-often unexplained scenes and strange behavior that I found pretentious in the extreme. I can understand that, if they have to consume a steady diet of play-by-the-numbers action movies, film critics get excited over something different and not formulaic. But for me different and not predictable does not, in itself, produce a movie interesting enough to hold my attention for two hours. I found myself nodding off on occasion-and it was only the middle of the afternoon-because none of it held my interest.
Nor would I say that is movie strikes a blow for lesbians. The characters aren't interesting, so you don't really care about their relationships, which are presented as manipulative rather than romantic. The Queen never gets to say that the relationships she has with women are more fulfilling, or at least less stressful, than the marriage she had with Prince George.
I just didn't see why the director wanted to resurrect this element of history in this way.",2,298,563,21 December 2018
Revolutionary Road," A very fine movie
","The trailers for this looked intriguing, and while I know they can be deceptive, I went anyway, having been very impressed by Kate Winslett's performances in other movies (Hamlet, The Reader, Sense and Sensibility).Still, I was not prepared for as good a movie as this turned out to be.Winslett and Di Caprio give first-rate performances, particularly Winslett. Yes, there is some shouting, but that's not acting, it's shouting. Anyone can do that. Both these actors say far more with their faces, their expressions, than they do with their shouting. They telegraph pages of script into glances, as the best actors do. Winslett at the end is absolutely devastating to watch as she prepares for what she clearly sees as a fatal act.The directing is very fine as well. The scene of the abortion is perfectly and most movingly filmed, moving at just the right speed, cloaked in just the right hushed almost silence, with discretion and respect. It would have been so early to over-dramatize it, but Mendes does not, making it all that much more devastating.There are points where one might want more elucidation. Why does di Caprio's character oppose the abortion? What is he thinking, married to the very beautiful Winslett, when he seduces the less attractive office clerk? There are other questions for which I might have liked at least suggestions of answers.Still, I don't need every i to be dotted and every t to be crossed to enjoy a movie, as I most certainly did this one. It is a very moving story about a woman trapped in a life that does not satisfy her, surrounded by others who cannot understand her feelings and seem to be very satisfied with what she has. In that respect, it recalls the middle story of The Hours, though I found this more subtle and very much more moving.The Academy may have overlooked it for best picture, but you should not.",8,0,1,25 January 2009
Amadeus," Director's Cut - too many words
","I'm not sure why directors are not the best judges of what should be kept and what cut from the final versions of their movies, but the director's cut of this movie, like so many others, shows that they often are not. Perhaps it is because they are too involved in the work to see it objectively? When this movie first came out in 1984, I saw it in the theater 20-30 times. Each time I marveled at how well it was made.Until tonight, I had not seen it since 1984, as I didn't have any desire to see it on TV. It was run on PBS tonight, however, and to be social, I watched it with my sister. I was also curious to see the director's cut, which is evidently 20 minutes longer.It was easy for me to spot those extra 20 minutes, the only scenes I did not recognize. They were, primarily, the two scenes dealing with Salieri's suggestion to Costanza that she return later and spend the night with him if she wants him to see that Mozart gets the appointment as music teacher to the princess, and the two scenes dealing with the wealthy noble with the noisy dogs who is looking for a music teacher for his shy daughter. The second pair of scenes really adds nothing to the movie. The first two cast Salieri in even a more negative light. None of them is in any way necessary, and the two scenes in the country do slow the movie down. At 160 minutes, the movie never dragged for me. At 180, with those extra 20 minutes, it did sometimes seem to dawdle.The 160 minute theatrical release is a true masterpiece. The 180 minute director's cut isn't terrible, but I can think of no reason to recommend it for a first viewing.",10,0,1,27 December 2014
Gran Torino," A very fine movie
","In the hands of another director, this movie could have become sentimental, politically correct, preachy, and many other things. Such is not the case here, however. Eastwood tells a wonderful story without ever going over into movie-of-the-week sentimentality. He carefully balances the race issue so that no race is all good or all bad. He never allows his own character to become warm and fuzzy, even after he starts to warm back up. He never goes for the obvious; there the ending is a remarkable example. I never once looked at my watch; I became thoroughly involved with the characters, whom I felt that I came to know through time as real individuals and not just as easy caricatures. In short, this movie did everything that I want out of movie and never disappointed me.If you want to see a thoroughly enjoyable movie that never goes to excess, never wastes time, and yet never seems to rush, this is the movie for you.",8,1,3,10 January 2009
The Longest Day," Hard to sit through the whole thing at once, but informative
","I have spent years studying World War II, particularly in France. I have walked Omaha Beach and climbed the cliff - with no one shooting at me from the top. I have walked around the square in St. Mère Eglise. In other words, I know something about D-Day.That allowed me to be impressed by Zanuck's effort to recreate a moment in history. But, with all due respect, this movie comes off, to me, as something of a dramatized documentary, a history lesson with cameos. It is great for learning about how we finally made it across Omaha Beach, for example, and up that cliff. But it pales next to the opening of *Saving Private Ryan* when it comes to making you feel as if you are there, one of those poor soldiers in the first waves trying to cross that beach.The acting is all fine, the 'staging' of the scenes, especially Omaha Beach, very impressive. I could have done without the brief cameos designed to make the French civilians look foolish, as in Bourvil's portrayal of the mayor of Courville.You will learn a lot about D-Day from this movie - though not as much as if you read any good book on the subject. The movie, being a movie, leaves us with all sorts of questions. Like: why didn't the Allied air force destroy those pillboxes at the top of the Omaha Beach cliff before we landed on the beaches down below. Why didn't we have better info about German positions in the area? Etc.",7,4,4,12 November 2018
Hidden Figures," A film worth watching, a story very much worth telling
","This is a good movie that tells a really great story, performed by three very fine actresses. Meaning no disrespect, I would say that it is something like a cross between the old Spencer Tracy-Katherine Hepburn *Desk Set* and the more recent *Imitation Game*. It tells the story of three VERY hard-working and intelligent women who, at the cost of giving up much of their personal lives, managed to accomplish great things.It's a lot more than that, actually. It's the story of three individuals - women, in this case - who, when faced with being rendered obsolete at work because of changes in technology, refused to just accept 'the inevitable' and complain about it. Instead they put in a great deal of time and effort to retrain and refashion themselves - and others - so that they can 'stay ahead of the curve.' To say that these three women could well serve as models for everyone in the workforce, whatever their race or sex, would not be an overstatement.Like *The Imitation Game*, it faces the problem of creating an interesting movie about individuals who work with numbers and computers in complicated ways that most of us do not understand. The script might have done a better job of making us appreciate that these are exceptional women, not just by telling us that, as it does at the end, but by finding ways of showing us that. It spends a lot of time showing us their domestic lives; it could have spent more time showing us their intellectual lives, showing us how these women were intellectually exceptional. The opening scene shows us that Dorothy Vaughan can fix a car engine, but that doesn't prepare us for her ability to master Fortran on her own. When, in the closing credits, we learn that the real Ms. Vaughan was a remarkable computer wiz, we're really not prepared for that.--------------------------For what it's worth, I found the blurb provided by the distributor, 20th Century Fox, to be very misleading. Here it is, with my comments in parentheses:'As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. (Well, these women did do wonderful things, but they were not 'the brains' behind the space program. That's a severe exaggeration.)Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women (The story is not by any means 'unbelievable' - much less 'unbelievably true.' Why is it unbelievable that these women, despite many obstacles, could achieve such impressive things?)known as 'human computers', (no, they were not known as 'human computers.' They were known as 'computers,' people who computed.)we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds (Ah, no! That is the very substance of the whole movie, which the pr guy who wrote this must not have seen. These women, despite their very real talents, did NOT rise quickly. They kept being told that because they were women, and black, that they could NOT rise the way the white men they worked for did.)specifically tasked with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughn, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines (True, but they only start to do so at the very end of the movie.) while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes.' (And here, of course, is the biggest 'mistake' of them all. These women are completely unknown today. Unjustly so, certainly, which is why it is good to have this movie. But up until now, they have had NO place in American history.)",7,8,35,5 January 2017
1917," Astounding camerawork drives an often moving film
","Though the acting here is good, this is most definitely a director's movie. The real star here is the use of the almost constantly moving camera, which is either following from the side or often leading from the front of the characters.Since the main characters are sent, from the opening of the movie, on a DANGEROUS QUEST, this means that they are in almost constant movement across a dangerous terrain - the NE part of France during World War I - that gives the director the chance to keep us in almost constant suspense with that camera movement. In fact, I came to feel, as I watched it, that this movie was like the sort of video game in which the player must traverse a certain area, always on the lookout for things that might jump out at him or otherwise prevent his reaching his goal. But in the end, it is the standard format for almost any adventure, be it The Lord of the Rings or a medieval knight's tale: the hero must traverse dangerous lands in order to prevent a great catastrophe, with only his wits and - in this case - very limited weaponry to defend himself from those who try to stop him.The movie most reminded me of a video game during the moments when it seemed least realistic. Without giving anything away, the main character's encounter with a rapidly-rushing, rock-filled river while still wearing his boots and kit goes far behind the realm of human possibility.There were also a few scenes where the main characters do things that, while they build suspense, would not likely be done by individuals in their situation, like investigating an apparently deserted farmhouse that they do not need to worry about in order to continue their quest.So, in short, though the movie presents itself as functioning in the real world of NE France during World War I, you have to suspend your disbelief on occasion when it enters a sort of fantasyland.Still, the use of the camera is often downright remarkable, as I began by saying, and that carried me beyond such moments and held me to the end.",9,0,1,10 January 2020
Lincoln," The finest movie I have seen since Schindler's List
","Not since I first saw Schindler's List have I been so overwhelmed and impressed with a movie. Yes, Day-Lewis gives a performance that will be one for the ages, like James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He gets great support from Straitharn and Jones, who make their characters come alive as well.But, for me, the two things that really allowed this movie to become the masterpiece I saw this afternoon were, first and foremost, the miraculous script, and then the directing of it. The script does not, in any way, play down to someone's negative idea of the American public. It deals with complex issues, sometimes in Biblicly-inflected language, that is beautifully delivered by Day-Lewis, Straithairn, and Jones. This is movie script as real dramatic literature, where the beauty of the language counts but in no way impedes the power of the drama. I saw this along with a fair-sized crowd, and you could have heard the proverbial pin drop. No one was futzing with his cell-phone, or talking to his neighbor. Spielberg kept us in the palm of his hand throughout, and we did not dare look away, for fear of missing the complexity of what was going on.By the end, I felt exhausted, and deeply moved by Lincoln's death, but at the same time very happy I had gone through the wringer with it. I don't know if this is what Aristotle meant by catharsis - I don't think so - but this is what theater at its best can and should do to and for us.Go see this movie. If it does not carry off all the major Oscars (except for actresses), I will be very surprised.",10,7,19,17 November 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," One very powerful movie
","I first saw this movie when it came out in 2005, and was deeply moved and impressed by it. I've seen it a few times since. I decided to watch it again tonight because I had just finished reading David A. Nichols' book *Ike and McCarthy: Dwight Eisenhower's Secret Campaign Against Joseph McCarthy*. (It's a well-documented book, and interesting, but it overstates its argument.)There is a lot to like here. It didn't get six Academy Award nominations for nothing. (Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a great performance as Truman Capote in that movie, but I still don't understand why David Strathairn didn't win the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Edward R. Murrow here.) The script is first-rate, the acting and direction wonderful, the black-and-white look perfect. Even though nothing was a surprise to me, having just read Nichols' book, I found it very suspenseful.This time around, however, I was left with a few questions, comments:1) Focusing the first part of the movie on Murrow's treatment of the Rodulovitch case doesn't prepare the audience for Murrow's subsequent attack on McCarthy. If anything, it diverts us into thinking that Murrow is angry with the military, which is not the case. It's a shame we weren't given examples of what McCarthy was up to and why Murrow disliked him so.2) Even for someone like myself who has studied this period in American history, it's not always easy to figure out who some of the characters are and what they were up to at the time. That might have been handled better if the movie had been screened while in progress for a young audience who didn't know who these people and issues were. Then the script could have been adjusted, or something like that.Still, this is one hell of a good movie, and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in 20th century American history or, more broadly, the role of the media in defending our freedoms.",10,1,1,15 July 2019
The Imitation Game," A remarkable movie - but not to be taken as a documentary, nor even as the only way to tell this story
","This is one remarkable movie.Yes, the story of the breaking of the enigma machine codes is a fascinating one, though, as one reviewer points out, this movie really doesn't get into the details of how that was achieved - details that most of us, myself included, could probably not have understood. And the tale of Turing, the man who led the team that cracked Enigma and thereby helped to save millions of lives by bringing WW II to an earlier end but then was persecuted under England's anti-gay laws, is a truly sad one. Again, though, it appears that the movie fabricates some details to make the tale particularly moving. But neither of those two historical events makes this the remarkable movie that it most certainly is.Rather, it's the same stuff that has made for great movies from the beginning: 1) a brilliant script that never plays down to the audience, but always keeps us interested 2) first-rate directing that knows how to bring such a script to effective life 3) first-rate acting that makes us forget we are watching actors and makes us believe we are watching real people going through real situations.This movie held my interest from the beginning and never let it go. I feel safe in recommending it to anyone who enjoys a really good movie.I see that some of the reviews on here talk about the differences between Turing and the breaking of the Enigma codes as presented in this movie and the historical truth. That's interesting, certainly, because this movie very much makes us want to know more about both, but it has nothing to do with the quality of this feature film. If I may make an extreme comparison, the real Medieval prince of Denmark, son of King Hamlet, bore very little resemblance to Shakespeare's masterful creation, yet we don't fault the play *Hamlet* because of that. This movie, like Shakespeare's play, takes aspects of certain historical events and characters and creates a remarkable and deeply moving story from them. It never pretends to be a documentary, and therefore should not be faulted for not being historically accurate.At the recommendation of one of the other reviewers on here, I have since watched the BBC TV movie *Breaking the Code* (1996) about Turing. Again the script is very good, and the performance by the actor who portrays Turing, Derek Jacobi, first rate. The presentations of Turing are VERY different, however. Jacobi's Turing is far less anti-social, and the BBC movie centers far more on the persecution of Turing for his homosexuality in the 1950s than on the breaking of the codes during the war. The presentation of Turing is far more sympathetic. I confess that I found *The Imitation Game* to be more engaging, however. Since Milos Forman's *Amadeus* was on TV the other night, I was also reminded of how similar the framing device in *The Imitation Game* is to the one used in that masterpiece. Once again the body of the movie consists of developments of scenes mentioned by the main character to an interrogator (a police man, a confessing priest) through whose reactions to the unfolding story we are given a key as to how to perceive it ourselves. The police interrogator's face, at the end, when he says that he cannot pass judgment on what Turing has told him reminded me of the thoroughly devastated priest who is left speechless after hearing Salieri's presentation of his battle with God.",10,9,21,25 December 2014
For Love of the Game," A schizophrenic movie
","This movie is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long, and that's not the worst of its problems.Perhaps the worst of its problems is that it tries to be two very different movies.On the one hand, it tells the story of a great major league pitcher, as he recalls the last several years of his life while pitching what starts out as an unimportant game and ends up becoming the most important game of his career. It is the story of a man who triumphs over adversity - pain in his shoulder, etc. - to pitch a last, great game.On the other hand, it's the story of a man who, off the field, becomes involved with a woman who only causes him trouble. She wants him to NEED her, and by the last scene, though he has pitched a perfect game, which is enough to put most men on cloud 9 for the rest of their lives, he tells her that he NEEDS her, they kiss in what is supposed to be a very romantic public kiss, and one imagines that the producers thought that would win over large audiences of middle-aged women.I can't watch this movie as a stereotypical woman - that's not how nature made me. I can only say that, for me, the romance was constantly aggravating, because the protagonist allowed himself to become and remain involved with a woman who constantly wanted him to choose between her and his real passion, baseball.But do many women really expect men to subordinate their non-romantic passions for them and tell them that they NEED them? Not that they love them, which is completely understandable, but that they NEED them? I don't know.So this is what the movie is about, and it keeps going on, and on, and on, with more incidents. The story simply does not merit going on over 2 hours about this.If you're looking for a baseball movie, this is likely to disappoint you. If you're looking for the story of a man who comes to the realization that NEEDING a woman is more important than accomplishing something important in his life, maybe this is for you. If you even exist.",5,2,5,4 March 2014
Major League," Not a great movie, but it grows on you
","This isn't a great movie, certainly, and it starts off particularly weak, but it does grow on you, particularly if you've lived in Cleveland. The characters are all caricatures, of course. There are no 3-dimensional characters here. But as time goes on, and despite their problems, this Cleveland team begins to come together and play well, you start to like them and hope they will do better, perhaps because we're raised to like the underdog.Some of the success of this movie must go to the director, who knows how to pace things so that we get involved in them, even though most of the characters aren't particularly likable.So, in the end, you could do worse, and you won't be bored.",6,3,9,22 October 2013
Singin' in the Rain," How do you review a movie that's quite literally off the charts?
","To be successful, a musical needs to have good musical numbers well performed. This movie has that, often in spades.In addition, it has one of the cleverest, most brilliant scripts ever written for a Hollywood movie, musical or otherwise, and directors who know how to realize it to its fullest potential.And two male stars that are, themselves, so far off the charts that we're lucky if we can appreciate at least part of their astounding talent. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor dance as well as any dancers have ever danced on film, and play off each other like the best of vaudeville teams. Debby Reynolds certainly holds up her end, but it's Kelly and O'Connor, and the directing of Kelly and Donan, that transform what would have been a first-rate musical into what is, indeed, probably the best musical ever made.Watch it once. Watch it multiple times. Each time you will marvel more at its brilliance.What a picture!",10,3,5,23 August 2015
Taken," Don't bother
","Someday someone will have to explain to me why an actor who starred in, and indeed received an Academy Award nomination for his performance in, one of the greatest movies ever made, a move that will be watched as long as movies are watched, Schindler's List, would waste his time and very real talents appearing in this embarrassing collection of clichés and cheap thrills. Someday someone will have to explain that to me.This has it all, folks. All the classic clichés. Young women who are brutally tortured, physically and mentally, because they (thought about being) bad girls. Different-looking Eastern Europeans who exemplify the most degraded possible aspects of (sub)human nature. (That has a long pedigree; think 'M'.) French police officers who are corrupt to the core. Endless scenes of violence and gun-play in which the hero is never hurt even against incredible odds but all his opponents get wasted. (Eastern Europeans can't shoot straight, etc.). Lots of peek-a-boo scenes of young women being prostituted in the most vile fashion. (Not, of course, that any are not vile.) This movie has it all, and used it all to play to the worst in anyone. By the end - if you make it to the end - you will want to take several showers.So then, tell me: WHY would Liam Neeson appear in this? Why?",1,7,18,9 December 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Not my cup of tea
","While the 3D effects were fun, this movie did nothing for me. (Without the effects, I probably would have walked out of the theater, which I almost never do.) It was a mean-spirited and nasty movie.This afternoon being a beautiful day, I picked up a copy of Alice in Wonderland at the library and read it out on the porch, as the birds sang and my more industrious neighbors worked in their yards. I was reminded of what a pleasure the book affords, all light cleverness and the joy of word games. None of the heaviness that makes the movie so slow-going.Lewis Caroll may well have had his dark side, but it would take someone with a twisted mind and a Ph.D. in English from Yale or Duke to find it in this text.Skip this movie and spend the afternoon reading the book. You'll be happier for it.",4,1,3,10 October 2010
Selma," A deeply moving picture
","Yes, the acting in this movie is all first-rate. David Oyelowo, by far the most striking presence in the movie, will probably get an Oscar nomination for his understated but therefore all the more powerful performance as MLK. (My bet is that the Oscar for Best Actor will go to one of this year's performances of a man suffering from a disease, since that is what the Academy seems to honor most.) What makes this movie so deeply moving, however, at least for me, is 1) the script, which is a masterpiece of organization and character development, and 2) Ava DuVernay's direction, which pulls together a very complex series of elements into a single narrative flow that, though it moves slowly, never once in the 128 minutes loses our attention, or even lets down the almost constant intensity. Nothing is overdone. Nothing is unnecessary. Almost everything is understated. Brief scenes have powerful effects by the placement of a camera, the timing of the dialogue (waiting for MLK to answer his wife's question about whether he loved any of the women he has had affairs with, etc.). People will praise David Oyelowo's performance, and deservedly so. But the real star of this movie is Ms. DuVerney, who makes everyone and everything else look amazing.At the very end, after all the credits - for which I found some of the music to be the only let-down in the entire picture - there is a statement that this is not a documentary, but rather a feature film that takes the liberties with historical fact that feature films take. And, certainly, it would be interesting to learn where this movie deviates from those facts.But in the case of this movie, it won't, in a sense, make a lot of difference. This movie makes such a profound effect, using all the tools at the disposal of a first-rate director, that it will be seen by those outside this country as 'the truth.' It may not be the most-watched American movie around the world during the next few years. But this I can guarantee you: it will, more than any other American movie of the last several years, shape how much of the rest of the world sees us for the next several years.-------------------------------A postscript: this morning I read a column by Maureen O'Dowd complaining about the largely negative portrayal of LBJ in this movie. She quoted presidential historians who maintain, evidently with good reason, that Johnson was more pro-active in moving toward civil rights reforms than this movie suggests. That is unfortunate for LBJ's legacy, because the power of this movie, one that is going to be watched over and over again for years to come, is certainly going to trump the work of presidential historians in the minds of the general public even here in the U.S.",10,17,39,9 January 2015
La La Land," Magical
","This is truly a magical movie. Sometimes quite literally, when the male lead discovers that he can lift the young woman in the air and then go soaring after her, like Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn in *Everybody Says I Love You*. Sometimes 'just' with their wonderful dancing on earth. Especially with the fantasy sequences.I am sure others have already praised Ms. Stone's and especially Mr. Gosling's acting, singing, and dancing. He in particular has a charm, and outright athleticism, when he dances that made their scenes together wonderful.What I wanted to add was that this movie often made me think of Jacques Demy's early musical The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967). You get the same sudden dance numbers set on banal city streets - and here, even on the freeway! - with apparently 'normal' individuals who turn out to be marvelous, athletic dancers. Characters burst into song in a, granted, unrealistic but still very natural way, often wearing outfits of one solid bright pastel color (at least for the women).If you enjoyed this movie - and why would you not? - you might want to check out Demy's earlier work.",10,5,11,28 January 2017
Woman in Gold," An interesting movie that deviates a fair amount from the historical facts
","This movie recounts the efforts of the niece of the woman portrayed in painter Gustave Klimt's famous 'The Woman in Gold' to have it restored to her in the 1990s, after it had been looted by the Nazis during World War II and then hung for decades in the great Belvedere Art Museum in Vienna. I recall when Ms. Altmann undertook her quest through the courts but, fortunately, I did not remember how it went or the outcome, so all that could be a surprise for me.I have since read the book that serves as a point of departure for this feature film, Anne-Marie O'Connor's *The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer*. I now know that this movie often departs from the facts, especially in recounting the efforts of Altmann and her lawyer, Schoenberg, to get the painting. That doesn't influence my view of the movie, but movie-goers should know that it is not a documentary.For me, one of the two outstanding aspects of this movie is Mirrin's portrayal of Maria Altmann. When the script gives her even half a chance, she develops an interesting and complex character. After seeing her last year as the owner of a rural French restaurant in *The Hundred Foot Journey*, it was fascinating to see her as an Austrian refugee. I knew such people when I was growing up in Milwaukee in the 1950s and 60s, and I found her portrayal very convincing.The other aspect that was sometimes but not always good was the script. Yes, there were times when it gave in to sentiment or just dawdled. But sometimes it made a real and successful effort to present its two main characters as more than just two-dimensional figures. For what it's worth, it makes both of them, and especially the lawyer, far more sympathetic than they appear to have been in real life.There were things it could have developed more that would have made this a richer experience to watch:1) Near the end, Maria recalls her father saying to her that when their family came to Vienna, they made an effort to fit in and contribute to the city. It would have been nice if that had been developed more. We see presumably non-Jewish Viennese watching with pleasure the Nazis' humiliation of Jews, but we get no sense of whether this came as a surprise to Maria's family, whether they felt totally integrated, etc.2) Whether or not the real Austrian officials were officious and cold, it would have been more interesting if their representatives in the movie had been less stereotypical and given more chance to express the complexity of the issues they were defending. O'Connor's book does that.3) It might also have been interesting to have some insight into the Jewish Austrain refugee community in Los Angeles, of which Schönberg (the composer grandfather of the lawyer) was so important a part. The lawyer is given no chance to speak about what it must have been like to grow up in that community, what was talked about, etc. When he and Maria visit the Holocaust Memorial in Vienna and he is so moved that he has to excuse himself to hide his emotions, that would have been a moment to let us know WHY he was so moved, what memories from his childhood the Memorial reawakened. 4) Near the end, when Maria recalls her aunt talking to her about the Klimt painting, Adele says she hopes that Maria, when she grows up, won't have to devote her life to superficial things. Given the surface glimmer of the painting in question, which seems to suggest something of the sort itself, the movie could have done a lot more with the implications of the painting as a depiction of a certain type of beautiful but ultimately superficial life. Was there a conflict between Maria's father's love of playing the cello, with its deep, rich sounds, and Klimt's use of gold leaf to portray Adele and her sad eyes? What was the culture like that Maria wanted the world to remember? If she is going to use the painting to make us remember it, what is the painting saying about that culture? That one line near the end of the movie should either have been cut or developed throughout the movie.When I got home and thought about this, I remembered that Adele died in 1923. At that point Maria, born in 1916, was only 7. The Bloch-Bauers would have been driven from their Vienna home in 1938, when the Nazis took over Austria. All of which to say that, by 1938 Maria would have lived with her Aunt Adele only 7 years, but the painting 22 years. Much more could have been made of the relationship with her Aunt - there is really only that one scene at the end - and the role the painting played for Maria as a memento of her aunt and that relationship during the 15 years after Adele's death that Maria lived with the painting. Also how that very distinctive painting shaped Maria's memories of Adele.It's true: as I develop this review, I am coming to realize that while the script has some good scenes in it, it really could have been a lot better developed.Still and all, the movie held me, and sometimes moved me very much. Very frankly, I found it did a better job than *Monuments Men*, which deals with a similar topic - Nazi pillaging of art during World War II - but in a more diffuse way that focuses on the American efforts to rescue the art rather than the meaning the art had to some of its owners. In that sense, this is closer to *The Train*, which remains, to my mind, the best movie treatment of the topic.",7,6,11,11 April 2015
Steve Jobs," A remarkably well made movie
","Everything in this movie is well done - appropriate for a bio of a man who couldn't settle for less than perfection. The acting is all good, but Michael Fassbender's performance as Steve Jobs is certainly deserving of, at the least, an Oscar nomination. The man knows how to act with his face and his body.If he gets that nomination/win, however, I hope he will go on forever thanking the cinematographer, Alwin Küchler. Especially in the last part of the movie, the way his face is lit against often light-blue backgrounds gives it an astounding, almost surreal quality. You see every bit of stubble on his chin, every pore on his face. But that face seems to glow, not like a 1930s diva, but like something that is not quite human. It is a fascinating light, but not a warm one.Also deserving of at least an Oscar nomination is the director, Danny Boyle. Boyle wrote the book on pacing. This movie never flags. There are times when he flashes back and forth, very quickly, between present and past. Sometimes I caught what was going on, a few times I did not. My fault, not Boyle's.The script, by Aaran Sorkin, certainly never plays down to the audience. You can see that he is the man who created those scenes in 'The West Wing' where fast-paced dialogue is delivered by actors walking briskly down a hallway. He lets no grass grow under his actors' feet. My only problem with the script was the very end, which I felt bordered on the saccharine, after having been anything but that before.This movie has no 'heart.' With the possible exception of those last few minutes, it will never give you the warm fuzzies. There is no one to like here, and really no one to sympathize with. But the goal of this movie is not to make you empathize with the characters, just as the last-minute explanation of Rosebud never makes you sympathize with Citizen Kane. It is to make you see and, perhaps, understand a very complex and driven man who played a significant role in the development of late twentieth-century technology. No, he did not create a tectonic shift in the universe, as he evidently believed, and no, the launching of his products were not the biggest thing in the century after D-Day. I was left, at the end, thinking that it was a good thing he was in technology, which was so divorced from anything human, since the human was definitely not his domain.",10,6,13,25 October 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Disappointing
","This movie got an A rating in the Cleveland Plain Dealer from a film reviewer I have long respected, so I took advantage of a free late afternoon to go see it on the day it opened.It's a shame the review was so positive, because it made my disappointment that much greater.There is very little in this movie that is funny. (The audience I saw it with almost never laughed.) Most of the parodies are simplistic and flat and don't say anything clever about the subjects they are lampooning.Take the extended water ballet sequence that is meant as a send-up of Esther Williams movies. The sequence itself looks like a poor man's version of one of the numbers in *Jupiter's Daughter*. Scarlett Johannson looks frightened all the while she's up in the air in that little basket, but not frightened enough to be funny. And then? Nothing. The number ends as it would in an Esther Williams movie, and there is unfunny dialogue with the swimming character concerning her pregnancy.And so it goes throughout the movie. Things happen, but there is no followup. There are parodies of different types of movies popular in the 1940s and 50s, but the parodies aren't clever or insightful. George Clooney's character gets kidnapped by left-wing script writers, but those scenes don't tell us anything about the black-listed screenwriters of the era.Etc.Some of the reviews on here say the movie is terrible, some think this movie is the best thing since sliced cheese. It's neither extreme. It's just a largely flat comedy, with too few laughs.",3,379,632,6 February 2016
The Reader," A good second half
","The first half of this movie, which focuses on the relationship between a young man (16 or so) and a middle-aged woman, is beautifully shot but pretty empty. It is as if the talent behind something like a Merchant-Ivory film (minus the script writer) had grabbed the first story that came to hand and filmed it just to keep busy. It's beautifully done, but apparently pointless.Then, once the trial starts, the movie gets MUCH more interesting. Kate Winslet gives a truly first-rate performance as a very difficult character whom we only come to understand over time. This second half held me.Yet, after it was over and I discussed it with the person with whom I had seen it, I found weaknesses as well as strengths. Michael, the young man who has an affair with Hanna, is studying law and guilt, but he really never has interesting things to say on Hanna's involvement. His conversations with his professor could have been much more interesting and better written.In the same sense, Hanna's preoccupation with order and fear of chaos, which play so important a role in the second half of the film, could have been developed in the first half. As could have been her shame over her 'deficiency.' Not the great movie some critics seem to be hailing it as, therefore, but still worth a viewing, especially for Winslet's truly impressive performance.",7,20,40,31 December 2008
Murder on the Orient Express," An often breathtakingly-beautiful movie
","'An often breathtakingly-beautiful movie' is not a common description of a murder mystery, but for me, while this movie had other remarkable features, it was first and foremost often breathtaking beautiful. I'm glad I opted to see it in a theater, with a huge HD screen at that, because it certainly added to the pleasure. Some of what we see is computer graphics, but I don't know when I've seen them used so well.The cinematography in general is wonderful and often very creative here. Close-ups of faces that make them look just astonishingly beautiful and at the same time full of character. Interesting camera angles. This movie is certainly a joy to watch.And then there is the acting. I thought Branaugh, a great actor, made Poirot too much of a caricature, but the rest of the actors do a great job with their roles. The camera often shoots their faces close-up, as in older movies, but it can, because these actors all know how to act with their faces.At times the script seemed too full of clues that we weren't allowed enough time to think about. Perhaps, now that I know the end - which certainly comes as a surprise! - the clues would make more sense on a second viewing.Still, a wonderful movie, and one that should definitely be seen in a theater. So much of it would be lost on a small screen.-----------------------------Since seeing the movie and writing the above, I read the book. The differences between it and the movie are telling. The end of the movie, the unraveling of the mystery, seemed too abrupt. It was as if the director had run out of time presenting the mystery, and so, rather than letting Poirot solve it a step at a time, he just dumped the solution on us when Poirot calls for a meeting of all the passengers outside the train.That in fact is evidently what happened. In the book, Poirot works things out one step at a time after he has interviewed all the passengers a first time. Some of his deductions are, at best, far- fetched, but others make sense and are based on clues that we have sometimes had dangling in front of us for some time. That working out, which takes 100 of the book's 260 pages, is basically discarded for the joint confession in front of the tunnel entrance. Looked at in retrospect, I can see now that the long episode at the beginning of the movie, not in the book, where Poirot solves a different crime in front of the walls of Jerusalem, and then all the business in Istanbul, should have been tossed out or pared way down. I can imagine it would have been painful to throw away so much footage, but keeping it left no time for Poirot to solve the case a step at a time after he had met all the passengers in the sleeping car.As I wrote above, before reading Christie's book, what we have looks great. I could understand, however, if Christie fans felt short- changed.",8,7,19,10 November 2017
Defiance," Not as good as I was hoping
","This movie tells a moving story, and there is some beautiful photography in it, especially scenes of the forest in the winter. It didn't hold me, however, and I could live a very happy life without ever seeing it again.Why? I think it needed a much better script, to begin with. I have no idea how this story could have been better structured, but it should have been structured. It shouldn't simply have wondered from incident to incident, as it did.The major characters should also have been better developed, to get us more involved.The violin solos were probably not a good idea. They kept reminding me of Schindler's List - as did various other things in this movie, in particular the closing script - and that does this movie no favors. Schindler's List, one of the most remarkable - not to mention most moving - movies I have ever seen (and seen and seen), is the masterpiece it is because it is well-structured, well-written, pretty much well-everything. This movie does itself no favors by evoking comparisons, as it falls way short in every respect.In short, not a bad movie, but one that does not immortalize its subject matter, as for example Schindler's List most certainly does.",7,2,6,16 January 2009
Parasite," A very strange but even more original movie
","This is certainly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. (Others have already summarized the plot, so I won't go over that again here.) Indeed, it kept getting stranger and more unpredictable with each new scene.It is, however, also one of the most imaginative and creative films I have seen. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to handle something that is perpetually unforeseeable.My only problem was the subtitles. I saw the movie tonight here in France with French subtitles. Half the time I could not read the white subtitles against a light or white background. It is so easy to put a black cartouche around the subtitles to make them always readable. Sure, you lose a little of the original image, but that's better than losing your audience for half the picture.Something distributors need to rethink.",8,1,6,23 August 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A one-trick pony
","Years from now when they are writing histories of the Academy Awards, I hope that movie historians are stumped by this year's award of the Best Picture Oscar to this movie, because I certainly was.This movie has one very over-used gimmick: the camera that follows characters while they are talking and walking very fast, usually down long corridors and often with drum accompaniment. That was sort of interesting the first time. But by the 4th, or 5th, or 10th time, it was really a cliché.As are these characters. There is the former star who wants to make a comeback in something that makes him look like a real actor. A cliché when Berrymore played it, much better, in Dinner at Eight in the early 1930s. There is the daughter who is all messed up because her father never spent any time with her. There is... All these characters are just complications of clichés.That leaves us with 2 hours that we have to spend watching the pitiful antics of two destructively self-centered actors, individuals for whom I could generate no sympathy whatsoever because they were totally focused on themselves, to the exclusion of those around them, whom they often hurt.Why would I care about them? Why would I care about this movie about them? I don't.And I don't see why you should, either.",4,5,9,27 April 2015
The Big Short," A remarkable movie
","This is one very remarkable, highly original and innovative movie. Scenes such as the one when a very beautiful woman in a bubble bath, sipping champagne, explains one of the more complicated financial mechanisms that lead to the Great Recession are remarkable.The acting is all first rate. With the exception of Brad Pitt, whose character is not very well written, I saw only the characters being portrayed, not the actors portraying them.The only problem, for me - and this might be condescending on my part - is that I don't believe this movie will make much of any sense to those who have not read up on all the complicated and, frankly, dishonest financial tricks that led to the Recession. The explanations provided, though very clever, all go past so fast that I don't know who could make sense of them if they did not already understand the situation.This is not a warm, fuzzy movie. The characters are either pompous or very self-centered. There isn't really a likable one in the crowd. but then, these were the men who played with the nation's finances, not just with other peoples' money but with other peoples' lives, as if they were just pieces on a game board.As the movie points out at the end, only one person went to jail for all this inhuman activity. This movie convinces you that there were thousands who should have joined him.",9,1,3,8 January 2016
Bull Durham," A fun movie, yes - but what does it have to do with baseball?
","A lot of the reviewers on here really liked this movie. And I certainly grant you: it's a fun movie, and an enjoyable one.But after having watched it again tonight, I was left with the feeling that it really doesn't have much of anything to do with baseball. Tim Robbins' character gets called up to the majors, yes. But we don't see any transformation in his pitching, any explanation or demonstration of how he went from a guy with no control to a guy with enough control to merit a call from the majors.Nor do we get much sense of what it's like to be a minor league player, what it's like to live in that world, etc. (No, most of them don't get to sleep with the Susan Sarrandons of this world.) Her character is presented as quirky, and so funny. But we never really see what she sees in baseball, either.Kostner's character, who has been kicking around in the minors for a decade, never expresses what that's like.We get a lot of funny sexcapes, and that's all well and good.But this movie really hasn't got much to do with baseball.",6,3,6,15 October 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Much better than just a 'feel good' movie
","I don't know exactly what I was expecting before I went to see this movie, but whatever it was, this movie greatly surpassed my expectations.Though it does not have the innovative photography that Orson Wells used in 'Citizen Kane,' this movie resembles that classic in the way it slowly reveals the causes of the main character's behavior, locating them in her childhood. Along the way, Emma Thompson gives one of her best performances as the very complex Mrs. P.L. Travers, the Australian woman who wrote the Mary Poppins books. As she fights to preserve her idea of her character, and the backstory behind it that the Disney staff only slowly starts to perceive, we watch her come to terms with her childhood demons. Two of the final scenes, the one between Disney and Travers in London, and then the premiere of the movie, when Travers watches her childhood story come to life on the screen, are the highlights of a movie that has no low lights.Excess sentimentality, which could have been so easily exploited, is always avoided.It doesn't matter whether or not you saw the 'Mary Poppins' movie or read P.L. Travers' books. You will find much to admire in this movie even if you have not.Go! It won't make you feel good, but it will let you admire some fine acting and script writing, and that is better than a Hallmark Hall of Fame moment any day.",9,1,4,27 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," How this movie got a nomination for Best Picture baffles me
","How this movie got a nomination for Best Picture baffles me. It's not terrible. There's certainly some imagination to it. But it goes nowhere - except to the obvious ending. Ideas introduced early in the picture, like Jojo being told by his invisible friend to develop the characteristics of the rabbit, never get developed. Sometimes there is comedy of anachronism when we hear modern pop music, like the Beatles, while watching a scene from World War II, but that too goes nowhere. Yes, there's certainly a change in Jojo's views on Hitler and anti-semitism, but they come for obvious reasons.I found myself wishing it would end long before it did.According to an article I read before writing this, the director/script writer added a great deal of his own material, including the imaginary friend, to this movie, and cut out most of the second half of the novel on which he based it. I don't expect feature movies to reproduce exactly the works on which they are based, but the radical changes made here from the source may explain why this movie doesn't hold together very well.Catch this at home on streaming or dvd. I was sorry I went to see it in a theater, where I was stuck just watching it for the whole picture.",5,8,18,20 January 2020
Flight," A very well acted movie, but not without problems
","This movie has a lot to offer, especially once it really gets going. (You do NOT want to watch it if you are about to fly somewhere. The scene leading up to the plane crash is very well filmed, and will make you fear flying even if that has never bothered you before.) What this is, at its best, is the story of an addict, alcohol and cocaine, who is still completely functional. (I don't know if that's possible.) He pulls off the miraculous landing of a small jet when there is a mechanical failure, using a presence of mind that seems surprising from someone who drinks and drugs so regularly and heavily - but since I don't do either, I don't know if that is realistic or not.Thereafter, once his addition is discovered, most of the movie deals with his efforts to cover it up so he will not lose his license and be sent to prison for years. He is not necessarily admirable in this.Washington gives a first-rate performance of an interesting but far from perfect man. He's a first-rate actor, and he makes us interested in his character even through we don't really like him.A few things bothered me about the movie, though.First, if the one flight attendant, Margaret, who had known the pilot for years, knew about his drinking problem, would she really have been so tolerant, and willing to fly with him? That seems hard to believe.Second, I didn't like the end in prison. It was heart-warming, yes, but almost like an ad for AA. I would have been happier if: a. he had let the accusation of the flight attendant pass at the inquest, and then been bothered by the fact that he let the woman's name be tarnished - leaving us bothered by the thought that an addict pilot could in fact get out of such inquests and go on flying.b. he had admitted that he was the one who drank the vodka, and we had been left with the fact that he would then serve a prison term.Third, when the story of the drug-addicted prostitute is first introduced, once the flight starts, I had NO idea how that connected to what was going on. It really went on much too long - the porn director going on about Nicole playing Desdemona in a porn version of Othello, with a Moor who didn't look at all Moorish, at least from the back, etc. A short scene establishing her situation would have been better, though it still would have been confusing until later, in the hospital, when we see her again and realize that her story will intersect with the pilot's. Frankly, we could just have met her in the hospital, without any of the preceding scenes with her, and still have figured out her situation just as well without any of the confusion.Still, it's a good movie, and definitely worth seeing for Washington's performance.",8,2,3,2 November 2012
Rear Window," A deeply disturbing but masterful movie
","First, the basics: this is a masterfully made, spell-binding movie. Yes, there are all sorts of holes in the plot, but this movie is so well made, and becomes so tightly paced, that you either don't notice them or forgive them because you are so caught up in the intrigue.That said, this is a deeply disturbing movie to watch. Often, you feel as if you, too, are trapped in a chair, like Jimmy Stewart's character, forced to watch stories that become more and more unpleasant, like the tale of 'Miss Lonelyhearts'. But you also realize that that is what movie going is all about: watching other people's lives from the apparent safety of your seat in the theater - until one of the characters in one of those stories comes looking for you! This is a masterful suspense thriller at the end. But it doesn't make you feel good about yourself. Would you have forgotten about Miss Lonelyhearts when she was apparently about to commit suicide because you were so wrapped up in another story? As I said at the beginning, this is a masterfully constructed and directed movie. But if you pay attention to what is going on and think about it, it won't make you feel good about yourself, or the act of watching others' stories.",10,0,1,24 June 2017
Green Book," A fine performance by Mortensen, but an underdeveloped script
","Viggo Mortensen definitely gives a fine performance in this movie as Tony Vallelonga, a man who shares the racial prejudices of his Italian-American world but then learns to overcome them during the eight weeks that he drives gay Black piano player Don Shirley through the 1960s American South. It's a great role - as it should be, since the script was written by the real-life character's son, Nick Vallelonga. Granted, it's hard to imagine that a man who came from that much prejudice so easily overcomes homophobia - he's even willing to spend the night in the same bedroom with Shirley - but the script was clearly written to make Tony Vallelonga look good.Granted, it's a little hard to accept Mortensen physically at times, since the original Vallelonga ate astounding quantities of food - and was a very big guy as a result - but I guess there was no point in putting him in a fat suit.My problem with the movie, which I enjoyed, is that the script did not do a very good job of developing Don Shirley's character. Anyone who has seen *Midnight* knows that Mahershala Ali, the actor who plays him here, could have handled a complex character, but he isn't given a lot to work with. It's a shame, because it would have made for a more interesting movie.The whole movie is really the relationship between these two characters. The rest is all fine, but peripheral.",7,1,2,27 January 2019
Da 5 Bloods," A powerful and difficult movie
","I can't rate this movie. The impression it made on me was so powerful, and so emotional, that I can't stand back from it and come up with a rational rating.There is a great deal that is very good in this movie. There are scenes of remarkable power, brought off by first-rate actors, that leave you emotionally wrung out.But there are also scenes where I found myself saying: No, you can't do that to us with these characters, whom we've gotten to know. You just can't do that to us.And there are also a few important scenes, such as when Paul reconnects with his memory of what happened to Norm, where you wish things had not been done that way.Some have written that the film is too long. I don't know that it's too long, but having my emotions pummeled over and over for 2.5 hours was too exhausting for me. I had to take a break in the middle. I don't know what it would have been like had I seen this in a movie theater and not had that option.Should you see this movie? Absolutely! Will you enjoy it? That's not the verb I would use. Will you forget this movie? Some parts of it, definitely not. Ever.",Null,5,13,15 June 2020
Sully," I really wanted to like this movie, but I was only lukewarm about it
","I really wanted to like this movie. It tells the story of a good man who tries his hardest to do what is right, only to be blindsided by a bureaucratic establishment that is more interested in rules and the bottom line than human welfare - which those rules should have been created to protect. It stars a very fine actor, Tom Hanks, who gives a very fine, very understated performance. It is directed by Clint Eastwood, many of whose movies I have very much enjoyed. But in this movie, I felt that there was way too much filler until the last 15 minutes or so, the hearing, where things finally began to hold me.I blame the script. Granted, there is not a lot to this story, but still, it could have been paced and developed much better. Why do the man and the woman leading the investigation seem so hostile, only at the end to become in awe of Sullenberger's truly remarkable achievement? We see snippets of the lives of many of the passengers, the air traffic controller, some of the rescue crew, etc., but not enough to make any of them come alive as people. Is there a story behind the co-pilot? A few characters better developed would have been more interesting, to me, that many characters just hinted at.The acting here is all fine to very fine. But the script is not good. What material there is could have been better developed, to get us involved before that final hearing. Especially since we all know how the movie will turn out.",7,0,0,29 December 2016
Up in the Air," A good movie for a pleasant one-time viewing
","I know that many critics have gone into ecstasies over this film. It did not impress me to that extent. I thought it a fine film, well-acted. But I also found parts of it, where Clooney's character succumbs to the charms of the wife-and-two-kids life after giving no indication that he was unhappy with his single life, too unmotivated. At least the end was not a wife-and-two-kids end; I liked his decision to take off on his own.What I found most striking were the short scenes with the middle-aged individuals he was firing. Being a middle-aged individual threatened with the possibility of losing my job of 25 years, I hooked right into those. A closer study of their plights would have been a different movie, however.In sum, an enjoyable two hours, certainly, but not a movie that I have any desire or need to see again.",7,5,8,24 March 2010
