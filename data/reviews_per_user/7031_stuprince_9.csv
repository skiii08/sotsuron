Mission: Impossible III," Better than II, but still nowhere as good as I
","First, I loved MI I, it is one of the best spy flicks I had seen, it was fun, smart, and kept you guessing all the way to the end. II was a dog, a huge WOOF of a film that had no story, just two hours of special effects. When I sat down to watch the third, I was not expecting much, and that is what I got. Better than #2, it does have a decent story, but the writing is so bad and the directing makes the film confusing at times. I though Ving Rhymes was a computer expert? Now he is a regular field agent. Also, frankly, I don't want a love story, just a great spy flick. It was not a waste of time to watch it, but I won't be watching it again anytime soon.",4,0,2,23 December 2006
12 Monkeys," Pretty Good, but not satisfying
","Twelve Monkey's is a sci-fi thriller about a world that has been destroyed by a virus and a convict sent back in time to 1996 to stop it, or at least provide lots of information.  The movie requires you to do two things, first sit and watch (you cannot watch bits and pieces and pick up the entire story)and second, THINK. Neither is a skill of most video/DVD watchers. Willis and Pitt are good and Stowe does a nice job as well.  Still, the ending of the movie left me unsatisfied and questioning if Willis' life is just a continues loop...see himself killed, live through global pleague, and try to solve problem. I would recommend the flick, but not the best thing I have ever seen.",Null,0,0,24 June 2001
Lost in Translation," Enjoyable
","In the days of action films that fill 90 minutes full of special effects and a mind numbing pace, we find a little gem called Lost in Translation.  The comments I have seen about the boredom and being surprised it is nominated for Oscars is not a shock, it is a movie that requires you to look into people personalities and discover how you have have a relationship with a person of another gender, without having sex.  Murray should have been nominated for best actor since this is his best work, not his most popular. He plays the lost middle-aged actor well, trying to show us that being an action hero is about acting, not his life.  I love Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, and his other huge over-the-top roles, but this one gave men, mostly adult men, something to relate to. 
I enjoyed it, great film",Null,0,1,16 February 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Lets be real, its an OK film
","Time to fall somewhere between all the other comments, it seems that everyone is looking for something specific, but me being interested, but not enamored with SFX, religious connections, or some great deeper meaning, I thought I could provide some 'regular filmgoer' thoughts.First, it is a good movie, but not something to watch unless you have seem Reloaded. Since it opens with no recap, someone that missed the second film would be completely lost.  I did prefer Reloaded because I like the new charactors introduced, the Frenchman, Seraph, the Architect, and the Keymaker.  All of them were solid and made me interested in what may be happening next.  I developed an attachment to each, even if they were bad guys.  Revolutions give us some new, but uninteresting people, I didn't care about most of the people in Zion so why should I care if they win? The Wachowski's seem to write better Matrix type people then real people.Next, though the SFX were very cool, the move was so dark it was hard to visually take them all in.  The fight scene for control of Zion was nice, though a tad too long in my opinion.  I thought this war would be won in the Matrix, but after about the first half of the film we were never returned to the place the entire series began...what is with that? It's the Matrix, without the matrix.  Neo's final fight with Smith seemed pointless, Neo could not win, but I guess that was the point.  To destroy Smith, Neo had to be assimilated (the Borg would be so proud) so the machines could gain control of the program Smith. By the way, is Neo dead? in another coma? or just a program?  Someone help me on this?Finally, We found out in the second movie that Neo was just the most recent 'One,'  each time a matrix is created another 'One' comes with it. Therefore won't this whole thing just keep happening over and over? Yes, billions will now be freed, but where will they go? Zion appeared a tad overcrowded already and the machines, though at peace for the moment, don't seem ready to give some of their beautifully landscaped territory to the humans that have already tried to destroy them once.  So, it is a good film, but I prefer the other two based on the matrix action.  Will enjoy the day I buy them all and sit and watch them back to back to back...maybe more of this will make sense!",5,0,0,10 April 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Great film, but nothing like the original
","Not much more to say that other users have not said.  I thought this was the best film I had seen in several years.  Pitt, Clooney, Damon come across very 'cool' in this film, just as they are supposed to. 
A couple of thoughts not seen in comments (at least not too much); the music in the film was great, just keeping the tome of the film from ever falling off.  Carl Reiner was terrific as Saul, great to see him back in films. Julia Roberts part was just 'blah.'  Seemed like her part could have been written better, but she was a minor charactor so, big deal!This film was better in the theater, but the tape is great too, rent it!",10,0,0,1 June 2002
Pearl Harbor," Ho Hum, pretty average flick
","Wow, just an average summer flick with a great advertising push.  Pearl Harbor never gets off the ground until the action sequences which are impressive.  The attempted love story is poorly written, poorly directed, and filled with cardboard charactors.  The only actors in the movie I liked were Gooding Jr, Baldwin, and Tom Sizemore as the sargent, unfortunatly none of them get to spend much time on screen.  The main charactors are cliche speaking cut-outs that you almost hope will die during the attack if for no other reason than they are so uninteresting.To really understand the attack from both sides rent Tora, Tora, Tora, if you like special effects check this out.  But summer movie dollars can be spent better elsewhere.",5,0,0,24 June 2001
The Dark Knight," A very Good Movie, but I prefer Jack
","OK, I have now seen this film twice and maybe the problem is all the hype it got. Both times I have seen it I have come away with the same thoughts and feelings.This is a good movie, no doubt about that, dark, action packed, good supporting roles (especially Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Michael Caine). Cool toys and special effects make this fun to watch, and the good guys (for the most part) win in the end. Just the kind of film that is fun to watch in the summertime.As for this being one of the greatest films ever, not IMHO. Heath Ledger is a good Joker, especially as this movie moves along and he has more interaction with Christian Bale's Batman. the farther into the movie it gets, the more evilly humorous he gets. For my money, I still prefer Jack Nicholson in that role, maybe it is the writing, but his lines are classic, while Ledger's lines are much less memorable (Why So Serious is pretty good). Ledger is much darker and more evil, but to me The Joker needs to have a little more humor to him.Good movie, but I would take the 1989 version over this one (but that is like preferring a Mercedes over a BMW...you win with either one!",5,1,6,13 June 2009
WALLÂ·E," baffled by so many voters
","OK, lets all get a grip. Why do people have to come on tho IMDb and bash a movie because it does not agree with their political views or give it a one so that it will 'balance' the votes.So, lets try to get this straight, I am not an environmentalist, but Wall:E does discuss a real issue in today's world (as does Gone with the Wind, Midnight Cowboy, Brookback Mountain, and many others)and if you are not on the side of the filmmakers than so what? Disagree and enjoy the film! Everything is NOT a left wing plot to twist minds, you have the ability to listen, watch, enjoy, and disagree if you chose.This is a great achievement in film making, especially in animated film. With very little dialog, the film manages to discuss a current issue, develop a cute love story, and really slam the typical American who just sits around and cannot function without our electronics...this issue I agree with.I can see how small children may not like this as you need the ability to follow a story without the dialog walking us through, a tough skill for many small kids (and too many adults).the animation is amazing and this really is a good SciFi movie, not just a good animated film. Plus, the little short about the magician before the flick is good too.",8,0,4,30 June 2008
The Replacements," if you know nothing about football, this might work
","Well, you can get a chuckle or two out of this film, maybe even find some inspiration or cheer for the underdog, but for people who know ANYTHING about football, this moving is just one mistake after another. Whomever edited this thing should be drummed out of Hollywood. Just go to the goofs section and that might begin to list all the continuity and factual errors. Players on the field, then off the field in the next shot. Jus the problems with how the structure of the team is built makes no sense. Why fire a coach and hire a new one during a strike? Why no backup quarterback? Why are players playing both ways? What is a QB doing on a kickoff team? it goes on and on and drives me crazy.",5,1,3,1 October 2009
