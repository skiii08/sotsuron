Marie Antoinette," Wait for the rental release
","I wish I had waited for this movie to come out on rental. It had a few very nice points but was unsatisfactory.Great costuming and I approve of most of the casting! Truly the costuming was impressive, exultant, and the height of opulence. I adore Kirsten Dunst. She cut an excellent figure in this film. The colors were magnificent and often played up her blue eyes, but as striking as the artistry was the timing of the scenes seemed off.The only film I would compare this with is Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. That film also integrated modern music/ features.Some scenes dragged and others felt disconnected (possibly used to make you feel as Marie did but succeeding in only confusion). The viewer is not brought into the picture but is left out of the loop as to the court and characters. This way you are watching a play in which whispers are the means of communication and though gossip may have been in vogue at court it was difficult to follow who was what and to discern motivation. This way of presenting the material lacked interest and quickly bored me. I say this in comparison with the other period films I have watched. There is also no means of knowing how much time has elapsed unless you want to crack a book while you watch.Worst of all, the soundtrack was completely inappropriate. I could not keep from wincing and wrinkling my nose every time they started in. This music and the behavior of the dance scene would be better suited to a Gothic club. I do not usually go to a period flick when I want to see moshing.The scenes I wanted to see more of or wanted further detail in the dialogue were cut short. The scenes I wanted to see less of were prolonged.Additionally, it would have been nice to see at least in part what happens to her in the end.If you want to see beautiful costumes and a lovely court this is the movie for you despite the rest. Obviously since I have given this movie a one I would take back my time if I could and at least not pay to see this in the theater. A three would have been my vote if the clash between the beauty and the ugly display were not quite so repugnant as to make the whole unaesthetic. Were the less wonderful parts brought up to par this film would merit at Least a six and very possibly more. This may have been better as a silent film. Marie Antoinette is decidedly a tragic picture.",1,1,3,31 October 2006
