Marie Antoinette," Fluff, puff and a lot of hot air
","Compared to Sofia Coppolas previous efforts, this film is a disaster of historical proportions. It's not a totally bad movie but it lacks depth and heart. At times it feels like an unwanted child, because it didn't turn out the way everybody imagined.Marie Antoinette has little plot, but unlike the magical Lost in Translation, it creates VERY LITTLE EMOTION. And that's a major flaw. LIT was packed with emotion and you cared about the characters, in Marie Antoinette the people are very shallow. The performances are OK, but nobody gets a chance to shine. The direction by Sofia Coppola creates no contrasts, no real drama, no dialog and no great acting moments. It's like entering a beautiful room, sitting on a beautiful chair and staring at the wall for a couple of minutes.There are a handful of really good sequences like a ladybug flying away or the scene with the elephant in the park, but the rest is a waste of time and money. And that's a darn shame, because it could have been good.This movie has no real concept. It's meant to be punky and fresh but it isn't. It's not consequent enough. Neither is the film dreamy like the Virgin Suicides. Showing the sunlight breaking through the trees and people rolling in the grass or falling into bed is not very surprising if you use these tricks in every movie.The use of 70ies and 80ies rock music in this biopic is OK, too, but it delivers not the same emotional impact like the songs in LIT or the dreamy soundtrack in Virgin Suicides.I watched this movie on opening day, the theater was only half-full and the people that sat around me reacted negatively when the film ended. It just didn't work. I had a lot of info beforehand, so the situation was not surprising to me at all but I have to admit that three questions popped in my mind after leaving the theater: Who the hell directed Lost in Translation? Is Sofia Coppola a fraud? Why is there so much nepotism?Just think about LIT with different leads, like David Hasselhoff and Paris Hilton for example. Would the story stand the test of time? I give three stars for Marie Antoinette: One star for Milena Canonero, who will win another Oscar for her costumes. The second star for the brave decision to use modern music. The third star for the location, the Palace of Versailles.",3,2,3,4 November 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Tinseltowns take on Global Warming
","The day after tomorrow... I still will be angry to have wasted 2 hours of my life. Plot holes as big as the holes in the ozone layer, bad performances all around that send cold shivers down your spine (in a bad way) and an embarrassing attempt to manipulate emotions by creating forced drama. Roland Emmerich showed us once more that he is not capable of making a good film, although the original idea of this movie is interesting.Emmy 'I'll warm you with my body' Rossum offers two facial expressions: being cute and looking confused, both not very convincing. Jake Gyllenhaal is up there (or should I say down there?) with Miss Rossum,followed by a stiff Dennis Quaid, who tries to walk from Philadelphia to New York in record-breaking time just to fulfill the Happy End a la Hollywood.There is so much nonsense in this picture I don't know where to start. It tries to be smart but it fails miserably. There were a bunch of hungry CGI wolves that looked so artificial that I nearly wet my pants (laughter not excitement). The only interesting thing in this crap-o-rama is to witness the destruction of NYC, but that's it. Toss everything else into the garbage. If you are a Homer Simpson-type you might enjoy this movie, otherwise I advise you to avoid this disappointment and read a good book on Global Warming instead.I'll give one star for the New-York-Destruction-Sequence. I also would have liked to see some Wallstreet-broker horribly drowned by the flood but I think that's too much to ask for.",1,43,82,30 January 2007
The Hateful Eight," Trapped in his private hell
","I want to state a couple of observations concerning this movie, namely aspects that are not obvious the first time around and even less obvious if you have a girlfriend/boyfriend in your arms to spend time together in the cinema. Well, in this case, it is wiser to stay home and do the 1-on-1 in bed rather than to subject yourself to this insane and dumb bloodshed that is called The Hateful Eight. By the way, there are more than 8 people in this movie. Maybe Tarantino didn't like his 8th movie himself but was forced to deliver it.Sadistic Tarantino-style was evident from the beginning of his career (Reservoir Dogs) but then, his self-hatred was not as big as now. He still had a sense of black humor. With Kill Bill it started to go downhill and every movie got worse and worse. If you open your eyes, you clearly can see that Tarantinos mental health deteriorated heavily. He camouflages the fact that he is full of passive-aggressive tension by talking a lot and describing everything, but that's not the main point although I feel sorry for him. He has his reasons. The bad point is, that he feeds it to the audience.The first element we see in this movie – when the credits start to roll – is a cross with Jesus on it. The cross is a symbol for 'the world' and Jesus represents god that incarnated as a human and was displayed to the world. Now we all know how it ended. In my opinion, Tarantino tries to make a point, but he fails horribly. With a good movie he would have told the most important thing in existence: the sense of being and why the world is like it is. In Tarantinos viewpoint the world is hell, full of betrayal, murder, hate and evil tendencies. Just like in the bible, the world is the playground of an evil spirit. Tarantino has the power to portray his own inner turmoil but is not respecting the audience. So in a way, he is just like his characters in the movie. The trailers don't really tell what this movie is all about, so – in a way – they are even more awful than the flick itself.Movie is not recommended. Good things though: lighting, camera, parts of the score and the 70mm format.",2,7,15,13 February 2016
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Cannibalism, murder, burning women alive, betrayal & gallons of blood
","This is a musical for the insane. Not for the funny crazy ones but the truly psychotic madmen you never want to meet in your personal life. Tim Burton definitely has lost it. I was deeply disappointed by how low the maker of brilliant films like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood has sunk.I have to admit that I write this review because I am enraged about the careless morals of the film. There are parts in this movie where Johnny Depp cuts throats in a cascade for several minutes and kills innocent people just because he is in a bad state of mind. A great number of bodies drop on the floor of the cellar and you see their heads crack open and the blood splashes all over the place in different ways. All over again. Just to see how cool it looks.Don't get me wrong, I'm not against graphic violence in movies. Sometimes they can be powerful elements that are essential to the plot (like the killing of those two guards in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS to show us that Lecter is truly evil for example). But with Sweeney Todd (what a cuddly name, they also could have named him Humpty, Dodo or Fluffy) it's different: the gory mayhem is meant to be part of the entertainment value of the movie. In connection to this they sing a lot of unmemorable songs in friendly and harmless ways as if everything was OK. Highly disturbing. And I mean not amusingly disturbing like Dennis Hopper in BLUE VELVET but disturbing in a way that forces you to shake your head and makes you think things like 'How can someone be nominated for such a role at the Oscars? If movies reflect society, in what kind of world are we living in?'Sweeney Todd is full of clichés and unnecessary gory violence. Johnny Depp once said in an interview that he also wants to make movies for his kids to see. SWEENEY does not fall in that category. I'd rather say that he should be ashamed of himself and one day he will be. Burton, too. If he's an intelligent man, he will realize what a turd he has produced. As you can see I am totally opposed and truly don't like this film. Therefore I will spoil the ending with great pleasure to illustrate the ill nature of SWEENEY TODD:Showdown at the cellar of blood: Sweeney realizes that the beggar woman - who has been slain a couple of minutes before - is his beloved ex-wife who once was separated from him by Judge Turpin (slashed too by Mr. Todd). He looks at Bonham Carter and says 'You knew it, why didn't you tell me?' 'Because I love you and I want you to stay with me.' she answers. Sweeney tosses her into the oven and she dies under horrible screaming. After that realistic slaughter Sweeney holds his ex-wife in his arms, caresses her face softly and thinks 'Oh my, what have I done!'. Meanwhile Toby, a child who has been beaten constantly by his former employer (Mr Pirelli) sneaks up from behind. Mr. Todd raises his head, looks in the air and we all know what is going to happen: Yes, a 13-year old (or so) child cuts Sweeney Todds throat open. Ice-cold like a contract killer without a whimper. Streams of blood run down Todds body and onto the face of his ex-wife. They both die in a pool of blood. Fade out...This movie is a sick joke. And studio execs will laugh their butts off. At our costs. This is Hollywood of today.",1,13,27,16 March 2008
