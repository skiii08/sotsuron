The Blair Witch Project," Very Disappointing!!!
","I saw 'Blair Witch Project' on opening night in Kansas City. I was extremely excited to see it because of the reviews it had been getting. It was stated to be the most disturbing/scary movie you have ever seen. You must understand. I am a chicken when it comes to scary movies. I was terrified during 'The Haunting.' I love being scared, so you can imagine my excitement when I heard that 'Blair Witch Project' was supposed to be 20 times scarier than 'The Haunting.' I went into the theater ready to be scared out of my seat! Not so! There was only one (count them...one!) time when me and my friend looked at each other and both agreed that our stomachs dropped just then. That was it! It might have a little bit to do with the big guy moaning right next to us, but I don't think so. So, all in all, this is a very disappointing movie. Not scary whatsoever!",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
American Psycho," The Ultimate in Horrible Movies
","I went into this movie thinking it would be great. I was ready for a fun filled two hours of watching a wonderful movie with my closest friends. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! This is quite possibly THE most retarded movie I have ever seen. There's no plot and no one ever explains the reasoning behind Mr. Bateman's killing. It is unjustified and just plain dumb. I can't stress enough about the lack of a plot. It had about as much of a plot as something like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'Sleepaway Camp.' So, take my advice and, whatever you do, DON'T go see this movie. It's not worth wasting your hard earned money on. My rating? -8/10",Null,0,1,15 April 2000
