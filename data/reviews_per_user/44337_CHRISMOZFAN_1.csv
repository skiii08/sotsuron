The Sound of Music," The Hills Are Alive-FOREVER!!!!!
","What can I say about this fabulous movie that hasn't already been said? I must have seen the film 100-150 times (3 times in one day-TWICE!!) but I still LOVE to watch it. The first time I ever saw it was in 1977, as a 12 year old. That was just before Christmas, and then the BBC started to show it, and from then on, it's been on BBC once a year, either over the Christmas holiday (although not Christmas Day for YEARS) Back to the film review- Stunning scenery, great singing-there isn't one weak song-my personal favourite is 'Climb Every Mountain' (makes me cry every time!!!) Just all and all the greatest family film-hell, make that the greatest FILM-ever made!!!! An absolute mega-classic!",Null,0,6,7 July 2003
