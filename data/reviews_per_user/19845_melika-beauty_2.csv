Angels & Demons," Reviewer
","The film was terribly tedious and long In the third millennium, making such films is a waste of time and a waste of the material resources of a community I think directors and screenwriters of such films should be sanctioned This means that no one will go to the movies for many years The people of the world maybe unemployed, but they are not at the hands of people It was worth nothing to watch free of charge Because my valuable time and my likes took What really worthless things are done for money",1,0,2,20 October 2017
Split," meaningless
","One of the most meaningless and most worthless films in history That even the value of seeing once was wrong Trashing in the true sense I do not believe the rating for this movie is higher than 1. Even zero is not worth it Does our viewer have 180,000 personality disorder? Or without film science?",1,2,8,1 November 2017
