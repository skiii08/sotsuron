It," It is now my favorite movie
","I was super excited when I saw the first teaser for this film and was not disappointed when I went to go see it for the first time. The movie is creepy and a bit disturbing, but not ultra scary, and it really doesn't need to be super scary to be a great movie. There's lots of hilarious dialogue mostly by Eddie and Richie throughout the movie and interesting things going on to keep the movie from getting dull. Bill Skarsg√•rd did a great job playing Pennywise and gave him some creepy features (Its creepy smile, the way its eyes move, the way it talks) that make Bills Pennywise different from Tim Curry's. It does a good job of getting the main theme (Facing your fears) throughout the movie, and as the Losers Club gets less afraid of Pennywise, so do you. I loved all of the kids performances in the movie, especially from Finn Wolfhard (Richie Tozier) and Jack Dylan Grazer(Eddie Kaspbrak). Andy Muschietti did a very good job at directing the movie, and I could not be more pleased with the way it turned out. The movie also has a great OST by Benjamin Wallfisch that sets a gloomy and tense mood. This has become my favorite movie of all time and I cannot recommend IT enough.",10,2,3,22 September 2017
