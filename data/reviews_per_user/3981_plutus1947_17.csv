The King's Speech," Th Th Th Thoroughly Deserved Awards
","The strange thing about awards being given to movies, especially Oscars is that either they seem to be absolutely marvellous and deserving or they are no better than 1000s of other films.In the case pf The King's Speech I can say that in my opinion it is one of the best movies to win an Oscar for a very long time.SPOILER STARTS The movie is about Queen Elizabeth II's father, George VI (he was given the first name Albert at birth) and the speech impediment he had from age 5 and which he could not cure.After his father George V died it was Albert's elder brother Edward who ascended to the throne. However he was in love with the twice divorced American Wallis Simpson.Because he was not permitted to marry Simpson because she was a divorcée and he was King he decided to abdicate without even being officially crowned. This allowed him to marry Wallis Simpson.Poor Albert, being the next in line, was very reluctantly forced to become King and took the name George VI.During his reign the Second World War took place and George had to give a stirring speech to his subjects in order to get them prepared for the coming war. This speech had to be delivered over the wireless.The movie is about this speech and what he did to try to overcome his terrible impediment.SPOILER ENDS The film stars Colin Firth as George VI, Helena Bonham Carter as his wife Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue who became the King's speech therapist.Although Firth thoroughly deserved the awards, especially the Oscar for Best Actor, I believe that Geoffrey Rush put in as excellent a performance as Loque and am amazed that he did not add to his existing Oscar in Shine the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in The King's Speech.Helena Bonham Carter was her normal immaculate self and was deservedly rewarded with an Oscar also.I would like to know what the budget was for this movie, but am sure it was a fraction of the cost many other Oscar winning movies were. This goes to prove that 100s of millions of dollars do not have to be spent in order to create a thoroughly enjoyable, touching and worthwhile movie.My advice is that everyone should either go to the cinema or rent the DVD when it is released and watch it as I am sure no one will be disappointed.Not only was it a great movie it was also very enlightening on a historical level.Plutus1947 ADDENDUM Before Prince Charles married Princess Diana he was having an affair with his now wife Camilla Parker Bowles.and because of this her then husband Peter Parker Bowles initiated divorce proceedings against her.However as Charles was eventually going to become the head of the Church of England when/if he became King the Church refused him permission to marry Camilla.This is much the same as Edward being refused permission to marry Wallis Simpson and also become King.The strange thing is that once Charles and Diana were divorced and indeed she tragically died the Church of England sanctioned and gave their blessing to Charles and Camilla marrying.I personally find this very hypocritical of the Church and would like to know why they firstly denied him permission and then did a complete about turn and blessed their union.My thoughts about this are that it is extremely unlikely Charles will ever become King and that William will eventually take over from Elizabeth II.",9,1,2,7 March 2011
50 First Dates," 50 SMILES, 50 TEARS
","After watching this film, I can't wait for the next Barrymore - Sadler pairing. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sadler although maybe not quite Liz Taylor and Richard Burton on screen are truly excellent together. I thought their pairing in The Wedding Singer was good but it is well surpassed in 50 First Dates.Basically the film centres around Marine Biologist Henry Roth (Sadler) whose aim is to complete building his ship and set sail to study the Walrus and Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) who has totally lost her short term memory as a result of a car accident caused by an errant cow. Needless to say Henry sees Lucy and the die is cast for a not quite so unusual love story.There is certainly more than a glancing association with Groundhog Day, but for my money this enhanced the film. Everyone played their parts extremely competently and the reason I called the summary 50 smiles, 50 tears is quite simply because the comedic action was performed subtly and well, even the slapstick. The same can be said about the tear jerking scenes also.The icing on the cake of this film for me was the ending. Of course once we knew that Henry's aim was to get Lucy's short term memory back, it was a foregone conclusion that he would succeed and both he and Lucy would live happily ever after. But were we right? I was pleasantly surprised with the extremely well written and somewhat surprising ending.All in all an extremely well written and thoughtful script, extremely well directed and acted on all fronts.I have rated it 8/10 and would love to see it in my Christmas Stocking.",8,0,0,11 November 2004
Gravity," Worth The Effort To Watch It
","It seems that the reviewers of this movie either hate it or love it. In my case I neither hated or loved it, merely liked it.Sandra Bullock is one of my favourite actresses but this in my opinion is not the best movie she has ever made.SPOILER BEGINS The movie takes place entirely in orbit around the Earth and begins outside the space shuttle which has been sent to repair the Hubble telescope.After a missile strikes a satellite belonging to the Russians the debris makes a beeline for the shuttle, taking out other satellites en route.It is never explained how this satellite was somehow hit by a missile.Mission control orders the shuttle crew to abort their mission immediately and return to Earth. Unfortunately the crew does not have time to do this before the debris strikes and all but destroys the shuttle.SPOILER ENDS There are basically only two in the cast of this movie. Sandra Bullock, who plays Ryan Stone, an electronics expert whose task is to repair Hubble and George Clooney who plays Matt Kowalski and is the Shuttle Commander.SPOILER BEGINS There are other crew members but although you see the figures floating around in space you never really see their faces or who they are. When the satellite debris hits the Shuttle these other crew members are killed.George Clooney (Kowalski) does not survive either as his tether breaks and he ends up floating away from the shuttle and his body presumably spends eternity travelling in the vast expanse of the universe. He does return to the shuttle for a couple of minutes either as a ghost or in Stone's mind.The rest of the movie is taken up with Stone somehow managing to get firstly to the Russian Space Station and when that too gets destroyed she manages to get to the Chinese station.Although there are a few 'edge of the seat' moments the movie I am afraid was a little too far fetched as I consider it virtually impossible for Stone to be able to get from one Space Station and then to another, especially being able to get to the second station by using only a fire extinguisher as a propellantSPOILER ENDS I watched this movie twice over a couple of days and I admit that the second time around I did enjoy it more, possibly because at the second viewing I watched it in 3D.Ed Harris played the Mission Controller but he was never seen on screen, only his voice could be heard.A great redeeming feature of this movie was the camera work, editing, the special effects and CGIs although I do not anticipate the script, acting or costumes will win any awards I do feel that the excellent camera work, special effects experts and editors are deserving.Sandra Bullock's acting was up to her usual excellent standards and I feel that it was a very difficult and tiring movie to make for her. George Clooney's acting was also excellent even though he only appeared for a short time.I have rated this movie seven mainly for the acting of Bullock and for the special effects. It is much better in 3D and I would be happy to recommend this movie, provided it is viewed 'tongue in cheek'.",7,0,1,9 February 2014
Match Point," Yawn!!!
","I always much prefer to give glowing reviews about the films I watch or review but in this case I simply cannot.Although I, like many of you, am a Woody Allen fan and although a great number of the reviews here praise Match Point as a classic and a masterpiece. After an hour of this film I was wondering whether to commit 'Harri Kari' or simply go to sleep until it was over.I decided to do neither, I sat through the remaining hour to see if it would improve. Sadly, for me, it did not.I have great respect for some of the actors, notably Penelope Wilton and the great Brian Cox, but even they could do nothing to improve this dismal offering.Having watched 1000s films of many different genres over the past 50 years I must say that this film for me has to be slotted into my top 50 least enjoyable, although I cannot say it is the worst.The one redeeming factor and most enjoyable part of this film for me is when I saw the final credits appear on screen.This is one of those films where there is probably no middle ground. It is either loved or hated by those watching it.My apologies to those who thought it was a masterpiece but this is simply the way I viewed the film.Plutus1947",2,3,5,2 November 2006
The Book Thief," More than excellent
","This movie has to be one of the best I have seen in a long, long time.SPOILER BEGINS This movies is not about the hardships of WW2 experienced by the British, French, Polish or other occupied country by the tyrannical Hitler, it is about the hardships encountered by ordinary German families, one family in particular.The story centres around a young girl, Liesel played admirably by a young Canadian actress Sophie Nélisse. She is sent, along with her brother to live with another family in another part of Germany but her brother dies on the way.When she arrived she formed an instant attachment with her new father Hans Hubermann, played by the wonderful Australian actor Geoffrey Rush.Her feelings for her new mother Rosa Hubermann played by Emily Watson were at best muted to begin with.The story starts in Germany in 1938 when Hitler is in power and progresses through the beginning of WW2 and the final defeat of Hitler in 1945.Liesel becomes friends with a boy a little older than her, Rudy Steiner played by Nico Liersch.When she arrived with her new family she could not read or write but Hans began the task of teaching her.She became enthralled in books and began 'borrowing' books from the Burgermeisters home. These books appeared to be borrowed on a non return basis.Shortly after the war began a knock came to the door and a young Jew Max Vandenburg played by Ben Schnetzer was outside asking to be hidden. Hans was under an obligation to hide him because Max's father had saved Hans's life during WW1.This is basically the story in a nutshell but it is an absolutely wonderful movie which should not be missed, especially the ending.SPOILER ENDSThis is an extremely sad and heart rending movie which requires a good supply of tissues.Sophie Nélisse, although a young actress played her part extremely maturely and lit up the screen with her impeccable performance. She was nominated for several awards and duly won quite a few.Geoffrey Rush was his normal highly professional self and played his part to perfection in the same way as Emily Watson played hers.I will always contend that Rush should have won an Oscar for his portrayal as Lionel Logue in The King's Speech.Brian Percival directed The Book Thief superbly.",Null,0,0,28 February 2016
The Polar Express," Absolutely delightful
","Having just finished writing a a review of the worst film I have seen so far this year it is an absolute delight to be able to write a review for the best.I watched both of these films back to back and am glad that The Polar Express was viewed second.This film is perfect for anyone from age 3 to 300 and has rekindled my belief in Father Christmas.Don't wait for it to appear in your Christmas stocking, go straight out and buy The Polar Express today.Plutus1947",9,2,4,9 February 2006
Radio," TOUCHING AND WONDERFUL
","This film, like most of this genre gives you its fair share of smiles and tears.''SPOILER'' The only thing I will say about the plot is that it is the true story of a mentally challenged young man - Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr) who is taken underwing by a football coach - Coach Harris (Ed Harris). The end of the film gives us a view of the real now not quite so young Radio and Coach Jones .''END SPOILER''This film is unreservedly recommended to everyone. It is extremely well acted and directed and a joy to watch.Another reviewer mentioned that they were appalled at the subtext because The modern residential and vocational facilities that exist today strive to find real jobs and make the people we work for functioning members of society. Although I certainly agree with this reviewer and thank God things have changed since Radio was a young man, I feel it must be remembered that this film is based on what it was like before we started to emerge from the stone age (metaphorically speaking).Cuba Gooding Jr for my money gave a performance which deserves to be rewarded and he showed us all how great an actor he is.My rating for this movie is 8/10Plutus",Null,6,9,15 November 2004
Mamma Mia!," A Real Eye-Opener
","This musical was a real eye-opener for me.If you like, or love Abbas' music then I am sure you will love this musical. No wonder the stage show has been seen by over 30 million people.I have seen non-singing actors appear in musicals before but rarely see them sing the songs. This is such a refreshing change, all the actors appearing in Mamma Mia sang their own songs.I never thought I would see Meryl Streep, Colin Firth and Piers Brosnan act, and sing in a musical and what a marvellous job they all did.Although I cannot ever remember seeing Amanda Seyfried before top marks must go to her. Her voice was perfection and she could easily have a career away from the stage and in the music business. She was a joy to listen to.I have given a 9 out of 10 for this musical, 8 for the film and an extra point for the wonderful singing of Seyfried.I won't go into the plot of Mamma Mia, I will only say that lovers of Abba should adore it, those neutrals I feel sure will love it and those who do not like Abba should put any reservations behind them and 'Take a chance' and rent it as I feel sure they too will throughly enjoy it.I must not forget Julie Walters. She can turn her hand to anything, whether side-splitting comedy or tear-jerking drama.Each and every one who had a hand in the making of this film deserve the heartiest pat on the back for producing such a great musical which I feel sure will be a hit for many years to come.",9,2,3,29 November 2008
Frozen," Enchantingly Wonderful
","I have to say I consider this Disney Studio movie cartoon to be their very best ever which was even more enhanced by the impeccable soundtrack. This I believe is destined to be the studios classic of classics and thats saying something when we think of the classics the Disney studios have produced. Frozen has broken all cartoon box office records and it will be a long time before this record is brokenSPOILER BEGINS The story is very loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale The Snow Queen and centres around two sisters who just happened to be Princesses.Both have powers, the eldest, Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel has the power to create snow, ice and winter and Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, has a power but that power is never revealed because while playing in the castle ballroom in the snow which Elsa created Elsa accidentally injures Anna's head and she has to be taken to the Trolls to be cured. In order to do this the power Anna has must be taken from her.Elsa cannot control her power so in order to protect her, Anna and their country the king and queen lock up the castle and lock Elsa away.The years roll away and Anna cannot see her sister and misses her greatly.The king and queen have to go on a trip which involve a sea journey but the ship sinks and both are killed. As Elsa is the eldest she becomes queen. On the day of her coronation the castle is opened and Anna meets Hans (Santino Fantano) a prince from another country and immediately falls in love with him. He proposes to her immediately and she accepts.Elsa the newly crowned queen refuses to allow Anna to marry and they have an argument which ends up with Elsa losing control and because she still cannot control her power she creates a terrible winter all across the land.Realising what she has accidentally done she leaves the town to live in the mountains on her own.Anna leaves the castle to find her sister and bring her back and on her travels meets Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) an ice-maker who is obviously down on his luck because since Elsa has created a perpetual winter he cannot sell his ice. She also meets Olaf (Uncredited) who is Kristoff's reindeer and companion and Olaf (Josh Gad), a living snowman created by Queen Elsa.When Anna finds Elsa, Elsa once again unintentionally wounds Anna with her power, but this time in her heart.Kristoff has to take Anna quickly back to the love of her life Prince Hans because the only thing that can save her is an act of true love so Kristoff assumes that Hans will be able to help Anna, even though Kristoff has inevitably fallen in love with Anna.When the dying Anna arrives home she discovers that Hans does not love her and only wants to kill Elsa, marry Anna and then kill her which will enable him to become king.After this we assume that the act of true love required to save Anna must be done by Kristoff in the form of 'a true loves kiss' but in a refreshingly unusual twist this is not the case.I will not give the final outcome of this movie away.SPOILER ENDS The storyline was exquisite and the acting (voiceovers) were immaculate. Olaf the snowman and Sven the reindeer were absolutely marvellous. The soundtrack was the best I have heard from any Disney cartoon, or any other and husband and wife team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the composers can be more than proud of their compositions.Of the many awards for Frozen this husband and wife duo have won is the Oscar for 'Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song'. The song is 'Let It Be'.On the soundtrack CD the music and songs that they composed but were left out of the movie were equally as good as those left in.An Oscar has also been deservedly won by Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee and Peter Del Vecho for 'Best Animated Feature Film of the Year'.All in all I have no hesitation in saying this movie is more than well worth watching, whether you are 3 or 93.",10,4,13,22 March 2014
The Mist," Yuk!!
","I really hate giving bad reviews about anything, especially movies, but I just cannot believe that this movie was produced from a Stephen King novella.If this movie has stayed faithful to Stephen King's prose then all I can say is that Mr King must have had a brainstorm when writing it.The plot was wafer thin, the acting no more than mediocre, though some of those taking part are well established actors, even though they may not all be household names, and the direction was pathetic.What took place in the store I feel was absolutely nonsensical and, even if people were facing a peril such as this I am darned sure they would not act and react like they did in this movie.The film was little more than blood and gore and I get more scared when I look at myself in the mirror.What happened in the final scenes were just unbelievable and I am convinced that anyone in this situation would never do what was done.It is such a pity because I do like Stephen King, but this was definitely not his best offering, more like his worst.If it were possible to give a zero rating for this movie I would have been sorely tempted to do so.Lets hope that this movie is included on the Golden Raspberry Awards nominations list as this the only award it is likely to get.",1,26,48,8 March 2009
Jurassic World," Jurassic Park 1 &2 Meets Jurassic Park 3
","Jurassic world in my opinion was a Jurassic Park (World) too far and there is another planned for release in 2018.I can't say it is the worst dinosaur movie I have ever seen, Age of Dinosaurs has that dishonour but I do feel that this series has now run its course and it will take something extra special in the next sequel due for release in 2018 to make me change my mind.I have not bothered to write a 'spoiler' because if you have seen all the other Jurassic Park movies you will know the plot because it will be imprinted in your memory.The redeeming factor for Jurassic World is it SFX, particularly when viewed in 3D.All in all no more than a run of the mill dinosaur movie, better than some but nowhere near as good as some others.",4,1,5,28 September 2015
The Artist," Oscars for animal stars?
","Oscars are awarded for virtually every category in movies so I feel it is about time animals were recognised in their own category. There seems to be more and more animals appearing on our screens so why not reward them for their efforts For me the very best part of the movie is what the wonderful doggy Uggie got up to. He is truly a superstar and be will be seen in many more movies. He has already appeared in Water For Elephants.Uggie was in fact a 'Rescue Dog'.Now on to the movie The Artist.This movie has already won 107 awards and been nominated for 74 others, all thoroughly deserved in my view.This movie is certainly different from the run-of-the-mill ones we come to expect.Firstly it was shot in black and white and secondly it is a silent movie, at least up until the last three or four minutes.The acting, direction, screenplay and costumes were superb.As far as being shot in black and white is concerned, I believe that more films should be made like this, especially the atmospheric ones.The movie Sherlock Holmes starring Robert Downey Jnr and Jude Law is one movie I feel would have been benefited greatly from being shot in black and white.Having been around when most movies were shot without colour I must admit for the most part they were tremendous movies and I think that the younger generation should take the time to watch some of these when I am certain that they will appreciate how wonderful they were and the sheer professionalism of the actors was unsurpassed.I believe that people will be talking about The Artist for many years to come and for all the right reasons.",8,0,2,13 June 2012
Les Misérables," Roll Out The Oscars
","Box Office records have been truly broken after the release of Les Misérables, and rightly so.Not only that the soundtrack has raced to the top of the the albums charts in US and UK.Over 60 million theatregoers have watched the stage version of this phenomenal musical worldwide and the people are still flocking in. All those people surely cannot be wrong.All this should tell us something about this immaculate story, which could arguably be the saddest story every told.Thank you Victor Hugo for possibly the most emotional story ever penned. I am sure he will be dancing in heaven knowing that such a libretto and musical composition has been created.I won't go into the complete storyline of Les Misérables because I am sure most of you know it.With regard to the movie.It is never an easy task to create a musical movie from a stage musical but where Phantom of the Opera was not I am afraid to say totally successful, Les Misérables succeeded superbly.Thanks mainly I suspect to the man with the Midas touch, Cameron Mackintosh.Each actor played their part superbly, Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean), Russell Crowe (Inspector Javert), Amanda Seyfried (Cosette), Eddie Redmayne (Marius), Sacha Baron Cohen (Thénardier), Helena Bonham Carter (Madame Thénardier) and Samantha Barks (Éponine) and everyone who appeared right down to the smallest part.We must not forget the wonderful performance of Daniel Huttlestone who played the young lad Gavroche nor the delightful Isabelle Allen who portrayed the young Cosette. Although Isabelle was not on screen for very long she played a wonderful young Cosette and Daniel's presence on screen was certainly very memorable.Added to this I was amazed that everyone of them had a more than passable singing voice, something I would never have associated with some of the actors, especially Crowe and Jackman but both Amanda Seyfried and Samantha Barks are well established for their extremely powerful singing voices. In fact Samantha Barks sang the role of Éponine in the Les Misérables 25th Anniversary concert.Also Colm Wilkinson played the role of the priest in this movie but he sang the role of Valjean in the 10th Anniversary concert of Les Misérables.One little known fact is that Wilkinson also appeared in the 1978 Eurovision Song Contest where he reached 5th place for Ireland singing 'Born To Sing' he was known as Colm T Wilkinson then. I hope Colm won't cringe when I mention this.There is one star I have not yet mentioned and that is Anne Hathaway.She played the role of Fantine.Although she was not on screen for the entire movie I have to say that she was without doubt the finest actor in the movie. When she was in front of camera she was simply electrifying and this I feel was by far the best performance she has ever given and she will find it extremely difficult to surpass it.Anne (Fantine) was perfection and when she was on screen it was impossible to take your eyes off her. Anne can also certainly be proud of her singing voice.SPOILER BEGINS Fantine works in Valjean's factory and is hounded by her fellow workers which ends up with her being dismissed. Fantine is a single mother with a daughter (Cosette) who is being cared for by the innkeeper (Thénardier) and his wife. I say cared for but she is treated with terrible cruelty and is no more than a slave to them.With no work or money Hathaway (Fantine) sells her long hair for a few francs.This scene for me was the nothing more than heartrending because Anne actually allowed her hair to be cut off on camera and did not rely on skullcaps or wigs. The expression of pain and horror on Anne's face as this was being done I am sure was not an act.Fantine still did not have enough money to send to the Thénardier's so she sold two of her teeth also, although Anne permitted her hair to be cut off she drew the line at having her teeth actually pulled, although it was jokingly (I assume) suggested.Anne said in an interview that it was one thing losing something that will grow back but when it comes to actually losing teeth it was another matter. I can't say I blame her one little bit.Still with no money she very reluctantly turns to prostitution to earn enough money for the upkeep of her daughter Cosette.Fantine ends up extremely ill, I assume with an anti-social disease and is dying. Jean Valjean takes her into his care but Fantine sadly dies, but not before making Valjean promise to rescue and care for her daughter Cosette.SPOILER ENDS Another tremendous plus for Les Misérables for me is the fact that the songs were actually sung on screen and not dubbed after the movie was completed. The actors had headphones hidden in their ears to enable them to hear the music and to do this, although the headphones could not be seen.I feel sure that every aspect of this musical will stay in the memory of those watching it for a long time to come.The direction of Tom Hooper was second to none and from the locations to the scenery to the costumes all were just perfect.We must of course not forget Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil for their truly memorable music and lyrics respectively.Les Miserables is up for a fistful of Oscars and other awards. I believe they deserve to win every one.plutus1947",10,1,3,19 January 2013
The Holiday," Just the ticket
","Winslet, Diaz, Law and Black at their very, very best. All four made it look like they had been acting together forever.Although great stars and actors these four are, even they were overshadowed in my opinion by another truly great actor who has never had the true recognition he deserves. This is Eli Wallach.Every time he appeared on screen the film shone even brighter than ever.SPOILER BEGINSWallach plays Arthur Abbot a bit of a ditherer and senior gentleman who used to be in the Hollywood film business when Hollywood was truly 'Tinsel Town'.Kate Winslet (Iris Simpkins) rescues Wallach when he appears to have lost his way home.From then on their friendship blossoms and Winslet convinces him that he should attend a special evening in his honour to celebrate his great success and contribution to the movie industry years previously.SPOILER ENDSI cannot see anyone not loving this film.Although we all know basically how the film is going to end, or do we?. The Holiday was a joy to watch for both its comedy and tissue box moments.The acting was wonderful and each and every cast member played their parts brilliantly.Full marks to the writer, director and cast.Added to this the two little girls, Miffy Englefield (Sophie) and Emma Pritchard (Olivia) were adorable. The downside is that we just did not see enough of them.",8,3,5,30 September 2007
August Rush," Superb
","If there are any Oscars spare, Freddie Highmore should be added to the list to receive one. August Rush for me was Highmore's 'coming of age' movie, a far cry from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.This film is by far the best I have seen this year so far and it will be difficult to beat.Although the general storyline is somewhat predictable, nevertheless it was written, directed and acted with great aplomb.SPOILER - The film is about a young orphan who does not know who or where his parents are but feels in his heart that they are alive and he wants to find them.His love for music and natural gift for playing and composing music is what keeps him going. He hears music in every sound, whether it is a dog barking or the clatter of saucepans as they fall to the floor. END SPOILER.The combining of modern and classical music is superb and thoroughly deserves the nomination for an Oscar for both Jamal Joseph and Charles Mack.A great deal of the music and songs were also performed by the cast themselves. This in itself is very refreshing.If you want to buy or rent a DVD I don't feel you will go far wrong if you choose 'August Rush', but be warned, have a box of tissues handy.Plutus",9,3,5,27 April 2008
Kong: Skull Island," Mainly Terrible
","It appears that the majority of those who reviewed this movie have the same opinion as I do.This is the worse King Kong remake I have ever seen.Not because of the acting but because of the pretty dismal direction, script and special effects. My criticism of the special effects is that with the SFX technology available today they could have been much, much better.Also the stupid things that did, or didn't occur were laughable.For example: When the ship carrying everyone to Skull Island was seen on an overhead shot there were 3 helicopters on the deck but when the flight launched to penetrate the weather front surrounding the island there were about 2 dozen choppers.The ship could never have carried that many helicopters because it was simply too small to carry that many and even if there was room how could they have gotten the others on deck in order to launch them because there was no lift to bring the aircraft onto the deck? Another gaff was when a number of 'toxic' gas canisters exploded and the gas was spread over a wide area and enveloped those still alive. Only one put his gas mask on but all the others just carried on without the slightest problem, not even a small cough.It is such a pity that this movie was let down by such poor direction and continuity because it had the makings of a great remake.",3,1,2,28 June 2017
The Blind Side," Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction
","Sandra Bullock is a very rare kind of lady. I hope she will forgive me for saying this but when she first hit our screens I could not see her as beautiful, although pretty. However from the first time she stepped in front of a camera I knew she was an actress of undoubted talent Now as she is getting older (but still a young woman of course) she is and indeed has transformed into a beautiful woman.One thing she has a knack for is picking the right movie to appear in and every movie she has made has been at the very least excellent. The possible exception to this is Miss Congeniality 2.I have given a synopsis of the movie below so if you don't want to read it simply skip over it.The Blind Side is one of those movies which I feel is flawless in both the dialogue, directing and of course the acting.Michael Oher is played by Quinton Aaron, a relative newcomer to the silver screen and in his first starring role. Although he played his part to perfection and I feel choosing him for this role was inspired by the Director John Lee Hancock I am wondering if he is likely to become typecast due to his size and will end up playing bully boy roles. I really do hope not as the way he portrayed Michael Oher tells me he deserves a lot more than that.He was nominated for four awards for his acting in The Blind Side and I am surprised he did not win even one. Morgan Freeman beat him for two of the awards for his role as Nelson Mandela in Invictus. If Aaron is up there with the mighties like Freeman it shows that he is an actor of enormous potential.14 year old Jae Head played the role of SJ Tuohy and the many scenes he played with Aaron were marvellously played and I certainly got the impression that both Arron and Jae developed an affinity with each other. Jae won a PFCS Award for Best Performance by a Male Youth and was nominated for Best Young Actor by Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. He certainly deserved this.Sandra Bullock played her part of Leigh Anne Tuohy as usual to perfection and I feel she portrayed her role as a combination of Mother Teresa and Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg, Sister Habit). As wonderful and caring as Leigh Anne was she certainly knew how to take care of herself and did not suffer fools at all. Poor Coach Burt Cotton, played by Ray McKinnon found that out.Did you know that Sandra turned the part of Leigh Anne down three times because she was concerned about playing the part of a devout Christian? Sandra won several awards for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy including her first Oscar and a Golden Globe Award. There has been quite a few excellent contenders for Oscar's this year and for her to scoop this for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role is praise indeed. Sandra has been nominated for 37 awards and won 36 of them which is a record many actors will be extremely envious of.There is not a lot we can say about Kathy Bates who portrayed Missy Sue (Michael's tutor) except that when she appears on the screen you know she is going to give an excellent performance, as she always does, and she did not disappoint us this time.I feel that every aspect of this fact based movie, the script, direction and acting was superb. Although Aaron and Sandra were the stars each and every other actor played their parts admirably and it was coup being able to get all of them together to make a very memorable and touching movie.My advice is either get it out on DVD rental or get to the cinema and watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.SPOILER BEGINS: The Blind Side is the fact based story of Michael Oher, a black young man, who in his young life had been shunted from pillar to post. Although he was a giant of a lad he was and I am sure still is as gentle as a lamb.Michael was eventually taken in by a white family from Tennessee where he was nurtured and loved by the whole family.Although he was an extremely intelligent adolescent he found it difficult communicating with anyone and learning.With the love and help of both Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), the wife of the family and her son SJ. Tuohy (Jae Head) Michael gained in confidence and managed to get high enough grades to play in his college football team.It took him a while to 'fit' into the team but once he had he took his team to the championship title where he was seen by several high ranking universities including Mississippi. These universities wanted him because of his immense talent on the football field.Because his grades were not good enough he could not join any of these universities, so Leigh Anne engaged a private tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) in the hope that she could get him up to the required grades.All those who have heard of Michael Oher will know that the rest is history.SPOILER ENDS:",10,1,3,13 September 2010
