The Benchwarmers," Very funny movie...
","I think this movie was very funny, and in the era of other comedies like Old School, the 40 year old Virgin and The Wedding Crashers (i love all those movies), this movie was fairly clean and funny for adults and kids...although some of the material could be considered a little much for younger children.With that being said, it was a very funny Billy-Madison type of silly comedy...not the funniest movie ever, but still funny. I don't know if John Heder will get typecast, but man he is funny in that nerdy type of character, and David Spade had some very funny one liners...i was pleasantly surprised and recommend the movie to others who just want to go have a good time and laugh for 90 minutes. You could say it is a Revenge of the Nerds type of baseball movie...",8,0,3,9 April 2006
The Longest Yard," The movie wasn't great, but amusing and I enjoyed it.
","I just bought the DVD and it is a pretty good movie. I don't think it was the best, but it was a good remake true to the original, and was funny, not hilarious, but funny nonetheless. If you enjoy sports movies and Adam Sandler movies, you'll enjoy this one. Not his funniest, but very entertaining. People may have been disappointed since it wasn't his funniest movie ever, but as far as sports comedies, its a pretty good one. One of the funniest characters is Kevin Nash's (WWF/WWE wrestler). He was surprisingly amusing. Also the DVD has some good outtakes and footage of them practicing and getting prepared, almost like a mini pre-season football camp. Its just flat out an entertaining movie, with some pretty good humor thrown through the movie.",7,0,0,23 September 2005
Blades of Glory," Very funny...
","I guess most people have heard that this movie is very funny. It is what you would expect from the people involved in this movie, all the way to Ben Stiller helping produce the movie. A lot of good one liners are in this movie as well as a lot of physical comedy. I liked it a lot. Anyone who goes to see this will not be disappointed. There are a lot of Ferrell and Heder haters out there, and that is fine, but then just don't go see this movie then because you probably do not have a sense of humor and wont get the jokes anyway. I hope anyone else who goes to see it enjoys its comedy, and i do think that most people who are going to see this movie know exactly what to expect.",8,0,0,1 April 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Very funny movie...
","This movie is very funny, and if you like Anchorman type movies, you will surely like this movie. My wife and i just saw it and it was funy, she even liked it better than Anchorman (She was not a fan of Anchorman, she thought it was OK and funny at times). As far as the movie goes, its a better movie than Anchorman, as Anchorman was more like a bunch of funny parts of a movie strung together. Talladega nights at least has a consistent moving plot story to follow. I myself think Anchroman is funnier, but Talladega Nights is funny too. Also, there are some great outtakes after the movie is over that are hilarious. Good and funny movie to go see...i highly recommend it. (8/10)",7,2,6,4 August 2006
