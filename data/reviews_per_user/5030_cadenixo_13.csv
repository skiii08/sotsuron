The New World," Movie Review
",I watched this movie for my history class. I learning some things I didnt know before hand. The plot of this movie was to show life in the new world and Poachahontis journey. The story starts with Jamestown setting up camp and then they run into problems with the naturals. They eventually fought and lost men. Poachatis tryed to stop from fighting and eventually moved to England. It must have been really hard to live in a time like theres. Today we have it really easy and I think some of us take it for granted. For example they had wooden structures for there houses and I bet it was freezing cold at night. The only question I have is the ages of the characters because in the movie pocahontis is 14 but in real life she was around 10. It really makes you think about that because john was a much older Man. One thing I lked about the movie was the camera angles and sounds. It was very cool to listen to all the sounds. For example listening to the peaceful water running down stream sounds cool. I also liked the fighting scene because I like action. One thing I didnt like was how long the movie was it felt like it dragged on forever. Ithought the movie was pretty good concidering it was about history. I thought it was intersting and I learned some new things i didnt know before. I would like to see movies with the same director because he has good ideas and good camera positioning.,5,0,0,30 August 2018
Walk the Line," play me some ring of fire because this movie was fire
",My family really loves country songs and I like some country as well. The music by johnny cash is also pretty catchy and he has many great hits. The plot of the movie was very well thought out and they did a great job portraying Cash's life. I really enjoyed this film I learned many new things. This part in history was a very cool time a lot of people were trying to create something and be the net biggest star and live the american dream Mr. cash had a lot of hard time but he was able to do what he loved the most he was very persistent. I've seen some of the actors before in other films and the cast did a great job. I liked how the movie never really had a dull moment I feel like all the seen were good and accurate. One thing I didnt like was the first wife she was very annoying and johnny clearly could have done better. What cash did to his wife by cheating on her was wrong but I guess it all worked in the end. She wasnt very supportive of Johnny and thats why he liked June because she gave him attention and spent good time with him.,8,2,2,24 January 2019
Miracle," mark whalberg is filming at my school
",This Movie was very good in certain parts of the movie. It got a little rough when they weren't playing hockey. It made it hard to watch in a way. This movie was a bout a usa hockey team striving for the gold medal. IN the beginning the team has no chemistry but with good coaching they were able to change that. They play the soviets in a friendly match and get smacked 10-3 which is a major setbeck for the team as they had big expectations for the season. They end up faceing the soviets again in the semi finals and all odds are against them and they pull through with a much earned dub. This movie did a really good job showing a team who had little hope win it all. I would recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good sports film.,8,0,0,25 April 2019
Captain Phillips," this movie has the green light for me
",What a great movie. What is there to hate about this movie it truly is amazing. Tom Hanks delivered a great performance in this film which made it so good. This movie did a great job portraying the real events happened. The story behind the film is a group of Somalian pirates board a us cargo ship and take the captain hostage this movie goes to show that you should always keep your head up even in the darkest of times. The navy eventually saves Phillips and kills the bad guys. One thing I didn't like about this movie was how suspicious they sounded when negotiating I dont know if I would really believe what they were saying. Overall this movie is a great watch and you should watch it even if you are tired of seeing tom hanks but then again how could you when he gives performance like this.,10,0,0,9 May 2019
42," This movie really hit home
",This movie was really good and Im kinda mad I haven't seen in before I love baseball movies but this one just never really got around to me. I get the chills when Jackie hit his home run to go to the world series its such a great scene and it makes you feel good. The plot of the movie was about the struggle that Jackie went through to be the first African american professional baseball player and he did it and was one of the best to ever play. This part of history was very brutal for the colored people and its hard to see how much hate and vulgar was used. Robinson had so many threats to his name. Chadwick Boseman did an incredible job and he was defiantly the best actor for that role. I liked the emotion he showed it the movie and it really made his character come alive. I would recommend this movie to anybody it is a very good movie.,10,2,3,5 February 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Nice ending
",I had to watch thid film for my amazing history class. The plot of the film shows the life of butch cassidy and the sundance kid. They go on a bank robbing spree and end up getting caught in the end after a life full of adventure and danger. Throughout the whole movie they are being chased. The movie wwas very good for its time period I was very impressed with how well the quality came out. The camera angles were good and the director did good. The only thing that made me question the movie was the ending ive heard other things to how they have died. No connections that i can recall. I liked the whole on the run type thing it made the moive fun to watch. I liked how much action was in this. I didnt like how boring the beginning was. The movie was good overall I thought it was very good. I would see it again after some time I have seen the acotrs in other movies.,7,2,2,23 October 2018
Remember the Titans," hall of fame in my book
",OK let me just say that this is the best movie of all time. I have seen this movie countless times and it gets better each time. I get goosebumps every time i see this movie. The plot of the movie is a struggling high school football team in the midst of a time period of racial tension. Despite all of these problems they go out and have a perfect season and grow and bond together. The acting is this movie is also very high quality and it was a great cast. It must have been very hard to have to been on a team with that much tension. It is a very heartwarming story and i highly recommend it.,10,0,1,11 April 2019
Hidden Figures," figure out whats hidden in your life
",This movie was very good and inspiring. It shows 3 African american hero and there struggles they have had. They work for nasa in the colored department and eventually they get to prove why they deserve to have the same rights as others.This was very important for African american women in the work place because its shows women and often times better than men and they should be allowed to have same rights. The movie does a great job showing us how it was back then and how they really had a hard time. I would highly recommended this movie to anybody it is a great watch,8,1,5,7 March 2019
Selma," True american hero
",This movie takes place in the 1960s and is about the black civil rights movement that was led by Dr. Martin Luther King. His role in this movement was very important as he led to success. He used non violent and peaceful protests to get things done. I think this was the right decision because many people would think African Americans are dangerous and violent if they acted in a violent protest it wouldn't be as successful as it was. This part of history was very important and I am glad it happend back then so we can all be equal today. This movie did a very good job showing the hatred and disrespect that the black people were faced with everyday constantly being told they couldn't do certain things. Overall this movie was really good and is very powerful to see dr king lead a movement with such power and determination.,7,1,4,1 March 2019
Wonder Woman," not so WONDERful
",I had to watch this film in my history class it a good experience. This movie is about ww1 and it shows a girl with superpowers. Her goal is to kill ares and to save stop the war. The movie wasn't really good in the special effects area and didnt really look real. One thing that made me question the historical accuracy is the whole movie besides for the fact that ww1 happened. I have seen other superhero movies. I like the actors. I liked how hot wonder women was. I liked how much action it had. The movie overall wasnt the best but it was better than most dc movies. Chris pines quote saying that people cause war is true and it stuck out to me.,6,1,1,15 November 2018
Thirteen Days," Felt like 3 days
",Thirteen days was a good movie for what it had to work with. The plot was the cuban missle crisis and they did a good job of portraying that. This time period would have been very scary realizing you could be bombed at any second. I am especially scared because after seeing how well JFK handled it makes it scary to see what Trump would or would have done.I have seen many of these actors before. I have seen Kevin Costner the most and does a good job in his movies. I liked the scenes where everybody is working together and it turns out that thats the only way they get things done It was a great time for the US and it really unified them.,7,1,3,13 February 2019
Back to the Future," a blast from the past
",What a great movie I have seen this movie countless times and its better every time. The plot of the movie shows a young Micheal j fox travel back in time and a lot of things go wrong and he has to fix them or else the future will be messed up. This part of history 1985 is very interesting to me it seems like it was really fun to be a teen or kid. Everything was so simple and it made sense. When they travels to th 1950 world the movie did a good job depicting that year and made it seem like that was the year the movie was actually made. I have seen the whole trilogy and i am glad I have because it is a very fun watch. I really like the scene where George Mcfly punches biff and saves the day and gets the girl who he deserves. One thing I didnt like but also like at the same time were the cheesy edits and special effects its kind of funny to see when we look at todays technology. I would deferentially recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good time.,10,1,1,30 January 2019
Cinderella Man," Cinderella is a man???
",I watched this film in my history class. This movie had me hooked throughout most the movie. This film shows the great depression and all the struggles that went with that. IT showed a boxing world champion fall from the top because of the great depression and showed how hard it was to get it back. The fighting scenes were a little unrealistic but its a movie what can you expect. Some of the shots that went negative when a punch lanced bothered me because it didnt look right. I dont have any questions about the accuracy besides fight scenes. Ive seen many boxing films and they are also really good. I liked how intense the fights were. I liked that it showed the struggles it made me thankful for the things I have today. I also liked how god the movie made you feel after he won the fight. I didnt like the parts were it was slow and could have used more. The movie overall was very god and I would like to see it along with others like it again. The actors also were very good and showed us how hard life was back then.,10,1,1,4 December 2018
