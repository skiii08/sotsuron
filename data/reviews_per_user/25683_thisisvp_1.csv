The Benchwarmers," Becnhwarmers Is a good clean fun movie.
","Yeah, this movie is not the most hilarious thing you've probably seen, but it was really entertaining and fun. Don't be so hard on it. I've seen a lot of movies that try to be as funny as this one and they do not come close. The only thing i would complain about is Jon Heder's role being almost identical to Napoleaon Dynamite. Heder was not given a chance to be as fuuny as he could have been. His amazing performance in Napoleon Dynamite might have type-casted him into playing only these kinds of roles and thats one thing i think he should be careful with. Some of the jokes Heder had to deliver weren't that great, but if you think about it, it is a kids movie and it is not meant to be vulgar and raunchy. The jokes in this movie were aimed at the younger audience, but it doesn't mean that adults will entirely hate this movie. I give it an 8/10.",6,0,0,11 July 2006
