It," One of the best movies of 2017 and one of the best remakes ever.
","I was waiting for this movie for about a year and boy did it live up to my expectations. It was well produced had its scares and laughs. The Loser's Club (most importantly Finn Wolfhard as Richie and Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie) gave heart to the film and made you care about the characters. Pennywise was simply creepy and the little details in this film made it really awesome, Bill Skarsgard was the perfect choice to play the dancing clown as he terrorized the kids and the audience watching the movie. The inclusion of funny scenes was clever from director Andy Muschietti as he had the audience in the palm of his hands so that when there is a scary scene they would have been calm due to the comedy in this movie.This is a must for horror fans and for fans of the book. Go watch IT or you'll float too and you won't regret it.",10,2,3,8 October 2017
