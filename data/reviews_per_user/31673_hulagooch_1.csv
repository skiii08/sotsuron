The Incredible Hulk," The best
","having a new Cinema in our city ( almost 6 years without any cinema here ) , i had the opportunity to go and grab a ticket to this movie , it costed me 3 dollars , it was definitely worth it . Hulk i saw the first one , sincerely i was pretty disappointed .. my eye was seeing a green cartoon hulk not a CGI one . the action was poor for me and a huge 3 hour movie ... This one impressed me , this hulk is strong and well done in CGI the muscles are incredible , the screaming is scary ( which i love ) . the fight scenes where amazing and the villain was super good . i hope they do a new movie with this version of hulk or even a better one!go see it ! it's an epic adventure",10,4,6,20 August 2008
