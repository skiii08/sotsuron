Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Enjoyable, fun, but I miss Gore
","Johnny Depp, as always, delivers a great performance as our beloved Captain Jack Sparrow. The rest of the cast was also great. Beautiful scenery, interesting plot, and plenty of humor, as we have all come to expect. The music, needless to say, was of superb quality, as always with Hans Zimmer. However, I could not help but notice that the direction was a little less sharp that with the previous three films. For part five, and I truly hope there IS a part five, can we bring back Gore Verbinski? With the previous three, there was a magic formula, and he was a part of that. There were scenes that, while good, could have been even better. All in all, recommended for all POTC fans.",9,0,0,20 May 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," Keep them coming, JJ!
","As a lifetime Trek fan (I pretty much cut teeth on the series), I could not be happier with the latest installment, and look forward to many more! Pine, Quinto, Urban and the rest of the cast bring the old, familiar characters back to life, with skill, humor, and all the little quirks we all know and love. The sets are excellent, the effects amazing, and the storyline is pure, 100% Trek. I can't really say much about the story, without giving things away, but I can't imagine anyone being disappointed. If you loved the original series, you should love this newest film. Well worth the big screen cost, AND the DVD. The direction was flawless. Two movies in, and it seems Abrams has broken any potential 'curse' that some believed haunted the first set of films. Everything about Into Darkness is true to the characters, and to the heart of Star Trek.",10,3,9,15 June 2013
Cloverfield," Cloverfield was Excellent!
","Not since Alien have I seen such a great preview; just enough info to tantalize, without ruining the movie as so many do these days. Cloverfield delivers, too; plenty of suspense, chills, and action, with believable characters and realistic drama that truly moves you. Michael Stahl-David and the rest of the cast impressed me with their abilities to show us characters, not actors, as I was drawn into their interactions, and their reactions as the chaos began. The point of view, that of the video camera, could be tedious and trite, but great direction by Matt Reeves makes it highly believable, and the varied camera angles throughout the action scenes add a wonderfully unsettled feel to the unfolding drama. As a long-time creature feature fan, I highly recommend this film. Just leave the kids at home, please. Any younger than mature teens could be very frightened.",10,8,17,19 January 2008
The Expendables," True Action Classic!
","One of the absolute BEST action films I have seen in a long time! Once again, Sly has given us the real deal. Great characters, tons of action, good setting. If you are, as I am, a fan of the 80's action movies, you will LOVE this one. None of the dark feel you see so much of these days, but plenty of speed, bullets, fighting, and great good and bad guys all over. Very refreshing change! Hope some others in Hollywood will take a hint, and get us back to movies we can love.Stallone is looking great, and the cast he put together is phenomenal. Big names, that know what the genre is really about, and they do not disappoint. Plus, the whole idea of having more seasoned actors, and not relying on some new pretty face is wonderful. Youth doesn't automatically make one good, and older can mean far better. Can't wait to add the DVD to my action collection, and hope Sly has more in the works for us. Far too few of this quality being made these days. Top notch movie, in every way.",10,1,5,29 August 2010
I Am Legend," Legendary Delivery!
","I have to amend this review. i will leave the original here, but have to amend what I stated before. I didn't realize at the time that this film was a blatant rip-off of a far superior movie, starring the incomparable Vincent Price. Having since watched that one, which I'd somehow missed before, I'm disappointed. Will Smith is no Vincent Price, and can't even come close.Also, I was a bit disappointed that the story was not presented fairly in the previews. The way those were made, I'd expected some wild, legendary creature, causing all the problems, and got something completely different. Don't sell me one thing and deliver another.ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Actor Will Smith has, once again, delivered an exceptional performance, bringing to life the character Robert Neville, alone in NYC after a disaster, trying to save the world with only a dog for companionship. We are drawn into his world, his routines, his recreation, and his fears, in this chilling setting of the familiar gone horribly askew. He brings to life the trials of this man, showing us every strength and weakness, every hope and fear, every joy and sorrow. The direction is superb, and the supporting cast does a wonderful job. The setting is all too believable, and the special effects and make-up are very high quality, making us able to believe that all we are seeing is real. Overall excellent film, actually deserving of awards.",5,1,3,19 January 2008
Groundhog Day," Classic comedy that delivers time and time again!
","Bill Murray really delivers in this one, as always, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. We watch it every year, and it never gets old, though I doubt his character would agree! Awesome movie, about love, and laughs, and life, and the choices we make. Good for the family, awesome directing, great scenes, just great everything. Except that song....poor Phil!",10,2,3,3 February 2020
