Despicable Me 2," great movie for the whole family to enjoy
","Much funnier than the first one, Despicable Me 2 actually has me liking the second installation in a series much better than the original. A lot of sequels add in new characters. Some serve a purpose. Others not so much. This movie adds in new characters that are important. With funnier lines, funnier actions, and tons of minion madness, the movie has us focusing less on Gru's villainy, and more on the love life he never had.",9,38,41,21 February 2020
The Mask," The Mask
","Extremely fun, fast-paced and colorful, The Mask is a movie with a good direction by Chuck Russell, a script very well adapted by Mike Werb, a beautiful story by Michael Fallon, great visual effects and excellent performances by Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz. Plus, it's one of Carrey's best movies and one of the best comedy movies of all time",10,44,48,5 February 2020
The Avengers," Great
",Are you a fan of epic adventure movies? Then this is your dream come true! Truly this is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's executed perfectly. Props to the filmmakers for taking the time to design it to be more than just a superhero film packed with action scenes and adding depth to each character.,9,39,63,23 February 2020
Changeling," WOW......SAD BUT WOW
","Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",8,41,44,23 February 2020
Men in Black 3," Good
","Men in Black 3 is fun, if flawed. Hugely better than 2, this stands as the better (if unnecessary) sequel to the original.",7,38,41,22 February 2020
Scarface," One Word: PERFECT!!!!!!!
","Scarface has a great storyline, brutal violence as well as having Al Pacino at one of his finest roles. Scarface is one of the best gangster dramas!",10,57,64,24 February 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk??
","This movie bucks me in the most irritating way. I love Hulk, but this movie really is irrelevant if you think about the bigger picture. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many other movies that actually have some kind of impact on the rest of the universe, but in the end, this movie is really just a filler in the middle of a greater universe and unfortunately, it really tells when you watch the movie. It's not that good, unfortunately.",6,48,55,23 February 2020
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible
","Easily not the best mission, but thanks to JJ Abrams direction and an absolute menacing performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman this movie is more than deserving of repeat viewings.",8,39,43,13 February 2020
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN
","I'd say, stay for the first 15 minutes then come back for the last 20 minutes, just so that you can skip all of the nonsense in between. Surprisingly, the werewolves have taken a dire turn in this franchise which is a crying shame because their presence in the two other films were refreshing and light handed. In one of the worst scenes ever, they all confront each other through telepathy which is hard to watch because the voice acting is so out of place. The wedding scene was gratuitous and the birth scene was ripped out from the pages of hell. Bizzare.",6,43,47,20 February 2020
The Equalizer," Great movie
","Really great action sequences, with some nice violent ends, and a very interesting story that almost feels like it starts in the middle, leaving you guessing about his past. It kind of has a very John Wick feel to it, but maybe slightly less over-the-top crazy.",8,46,50,22 February 2020
The Expendables 2," I enjoyed this movie
","The early 90s version of an action movie - non stop gunfire and fights. One very good reason to watch this series is that any movie after this seems to be excellent. The only saving grace are some really old wisecracks from Jason Statham. Skip it, if you need to.",6,38,41,23 February 2020
War Dogs," Better than I expected.
","War Dogs is based on a true story where two twenty somethings sell arms back to the US government. Jonah Hill and Mills Teller put up a great performance, they made the story very appealing. The storyline had plenty of connections with Scarface, from locations to tag lines. It was a good movie with a great cast. Definitely worth watching.",8,48,53,21 February 2020
Skyfall," 007
","The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past Bond and M which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",10,53,64,13 February 2020
Iron Man 3," love this movie highly recommend
","It's always hard to see a movie with Robert Downey, Jr. and not find his sarcasm and personality incredibly charming. He really shows why he is one of the best on-screen superheroes today by showing that he can have good chemistry with everyone ... even a young child. This is a huge step-up from 'Iron Man 2,' which failed in many different ways. It features a very promising villain that could also be the setup for future installments of - not only the 'Iron Man' movies, but the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8,44,55,24 February 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great
","This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",10,47,53,23 February 2020
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Afterlife
","Resident Evil: Afterlife attempts to take the series back to basics and delivers a campy action film that has fun with the material. In this chapter Alice searches for Claire and her group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse, which were headed for Alaska looking for the infection free zone Arcadia. Wentworth Miller joins the series and gives a strong performance. Additionally, the over-the-top action scenes are quite impressive, and bring a lot of energy to the film. However, things start to fall apart in the last act as the story goes off in some bizarre directions. Yet for a cheesy horror film, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty entertaining.",6,38,47,6 March 2020
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," 101
","When two Dalmatians named Pongo (Rod Taylor) and Perdita (Cate Bauer) are blessed with fifteen puppies, they couldn't have been happier. But when their new family gets stolen, along with eighty-four other puppies by the evil fashion designer Cruella De Vil (Betty Lou Gerson) for the intention of making fur coats out of them, Pongo and Perdita must call on numerous other animals to help them rescue the puppies from their fate. Important in animation history as the first Disney animated film to heavily use newer xerography methods for the purpose of cheaper animation methods, One Hundred and One Dalmatians may lack the visual beauty of Disney's earlier fantasy films, but the modern UPA style of the film helps it stand out as one of the most visually unique films of the 1960's. The infamous Cruella, thanks to Marc Davis's incredible character animation and Betty Lou Gerson's piercing voice makes her one of the most memorable villians of all time and despite a lot of it would end up being reused for numourous films produced during this cost-cutting era, George Bruns's score is fabulous with the best example of his work being the jazz-inspired opening credits that would set the mood for the more laid-back films of this time period. Overall, One Hundred and One Dalmatians deserves it's reputation as not only one of the most important films in the companies history, but also as a fun thrill ride for all ages.",10,39,42,21 February 2020
John Wick," love this movie highly recommend
","It's hard to find anything bad to say about John Wick. The action is beautifully choreographed, the setup is surprisingly emotional for an action flick, and Keanu.... What more is there to say? If you love action or even just like it you will be in for the ride of your life.",9,62,73,23 February 2020
Kung Fu Panda," One of the best films from DreamWorks.
","Take it from me, this movie is brilliant. Don't go by it's silly child-pandering name, this film is for everybody. From little kids just looking for some simple fun for a little while to adults looking for a more compelling experience that makes you feel for the characters, this one's for everyone. Funny action adventure with some wise words scattered throughout.",10,40,43,15 February 2020
Lone Survivor," Great story
","A truly brutal and gripping cinematic experience, Lone Survivor may be brazenly gung-ho and jingoistic, not to mention somewhat anti-climactic, but it delivers a metric tonne of thrills and contains one of the most intense and bloodiest gun fights I've ever seen in a film. It might stretch the suspension of disbelief a little too much at times, with our heroes surviving not 1 but fatal-looking cliff falls, but the excitement comes from the fact that it puts you right in the action, and you feel everything. Every bullet, every kick, every punch and every single thing the protagonist crash into. It's a bleak as Hell depiction of the savagery of war and just how strong the will to survive truly is. It's not a masterpiece, and many movies have been made with a more complex and compelling message on war, but for its sheer amount of heart-pounding action, scenes, it's definitely worth at least one watch.",9,44,49,22 February 2020
Fury," love this movie highly recommend.
",One of my favorite movies. Amazing cast and a lot of hard feeling moments that bring this movie together. There are moments that have you flashing between emotions and you can feel the emotions from the characters.,9,54,65,23 February 2020
Train to Busan," This Movie is Very Good
","You need to watch this right now. It breaks away from the stereotypical zombie portrayal. I love the way the infected move. The pacing and suspense of the film is excellent and the acting is brilliant, especially the little girl who is phenomenal. I'm rather into zombie films and sitting here with it having just finished, I feel this is probably the best I've seen by far. I put off watching this due to the trailer and some slightly unsure reviews but I wish I hadn't. It's better than it looks in the trailer. Most films have moments that you think could have been a little better but anything like that is just minor and doesn't take away from the overall experience of the film. This director certainly knows how to build suspense and uncomfortable situations. I already know I'll watch it again and again",9,70,116,22 February 2020
Underworld," Underworld
","Movies like Underworld just don't end up with the calibre of actor that Underworld has under normal circumstances. Somehow, Underworld did though, and yes, it's very much a product of that early '00s industrial inspired age, but it is a solid, solid take on some realistic(ish) aspects of supernatural monster mythos.",8,41,46,22 February 2020
Iron Man 2," Awesome suits
","This movie contains some throughly enjoyable moments that are on par with some of Downey Jnr's highlights as Tony Stark. The relationship between Pepper and Tony is taken further and built upon brilliantly in this movie. It contains some really cool and innovative action scenes which are taken for granted now. However the poor villain, a pattern in Iron Man Solo Outings, and the lack of direction meant this is easily the poorest Iron Man Performance. It's still an entertaining watch but you wouldn't be wrong if you skipped this movie when rewatching MCU Classics.",7,41,44,24 February 2020
World War Z," Loved this movie definitely worth watching
","A good movie with many intense moments, a great plot, and stellar acting. The only downside to this movie is that it is not an original movie-it is one of hundreds of apocalyptic zombie films.",8,60,69,20 February 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," I enjoyed this movie
",I don't know why so many people say that this oneis not good enough like the first movie. This has some better made actions than the first and very good job by thedirector who makes many great scenes whichmake more ..... the movie.,8,46,50,23 February 2020
Rocky V," Rocky
",Stallone trades in the ambiance of a big-fight atmosphere for senseless street-fighting. Rocky V is an unacceptable installment that tarnishes the already back-down-on-his-luck fighter. The uninspiring acting and street-smart vibe is just as damaging as the fighter's brain in this film. But though the film has some significant damages it still manages to be somewhat uplifting with the lack of magic it possessed.,7,33,54,13 February 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp is fantastic!
","Awesome action and swashbuckling adventure, great music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, good visuals and Johnny Depp's hilarious improvisational performance as Captain Jack Sparrow (the other performances are good as well but Depp's the highlight and you damn well know it) make the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure a fun action flick that's not only a great first non-Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures/pre-2006 Miramax & Dimension PG-13 Disney movie but also a much better movie than a movie based off of a THEME PARK RIDE has the right to be.",10,54,58,23 February 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Great animation
","Truly one of the greatest animated films ever put on the big screen. This film is extremely emotional, romantic, and magical. The incredible characters are so lovely to be around. Has a FEW all time great musical numbers that will stick with you forever. A message that will forever be important and truly a tale as old as time!",10,42,44,21 February 2020
Public Enemies," EXCELLENT HISTORICAL MOVIE!!
","This movie is one of Johnny Depp's best. Regarding content, this movie definitely flows at a high pace, but it lacks the violence that is characteristic of so many other American criminal movies. However, this fact does not bother me at all, and I actually really loved this movie, but I think that the lack of violence may be why so many other people rated this movie with a low score. In addition, I noticed something funky going on with Depp's hairstyle: it's reminiscent of 21 Jump Street! The way his hair is combed in this movie very much reminds me of his bad-boy hairstyle midway through the television sitcom. As a result, Depp appears to be much younger in this movie than in many of his other movies from this time era.",9,49,56,23 February 2020
Madagascar," Madagascar
",A great story of friendship and survival where an animal escapes from the zoo and his friends go to pick it up but everything goes wrong. The plot and their misadventures are quite original and the whole thing is rendered very well and generates great fun,8,39,42,17 February 2020
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Prince of persia
","Having never played the game I didn't know much about what the plot was about but the games were big hits and popular enough to make a live action movie so I eventually gave it a watch and was very surprised, The story is very loyal to the games from what I seen in the games, Some nice action scenes and good effects, I didn't like the choice of actors but they did ok, As far as game to movies go it's probably one of the better ones, Even if it won't stand the test of time (No pun intended) I think maybe it could of been better if it wasn't made by Disney as they like to tone films down so much that if you're over the age of 11 it's not as enjoyable, But it could of been much worse so I can't complain too much, A good family film that is easy to watch even if you haven't played any of the games.",8,41,44,15 February 2020
Ted," Ted
","Really funny at at times really stupid, Ted is not only extremely well performed by its all-star cast and an extremely satirical and stupidly funny film, its script and direction is also impressive, the music and touch is perfect which all makes for a very watchable and humorous comedy, the movie does still repeat itself and does feel tiring and slow-moving at times.",7,40,43,15 February 2020
Knives Out," Knives out
","Knives Out is really a classic story of it's kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character. There's a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries. And there are some good twists. In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking 'damn, are we near the end already?' but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing. Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics. The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone. In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others. It's just a classic fun film of its type.",9,143,187,8 February 2020
Spider-Man 2," Another excellent superhero movie
","This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well off of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as the villain and, as always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made.",10,58,64,24 February 2020
Blade," Blade
","Awesome action packed superhero movie starring Wesley snipes. When I found out that this movie is a superhero marvel movie, I was shocked because the dark tone, yes that's how marvel movies were back in the 90s early 2000s but the character of blade is not a superhero, he's more like a vigilante but they're the same thing but still, I was shocked when I found out. I really enjoyed and love this movie. Marvel movies back then weren't that good, they were really really bad. I loved the action, the connection between blade and the old man. The girl at the beginning that got bit, I wasn't a huge fan and she wss only there because every stereotypical Hollywood movie or I should say every movie needs to have a woman in the movie in a supporting role or leading role. I am looking forward to seeing the sequel and third movie in this good franchise.",8,41,63,22 February 2020
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not impressed
","There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",6,47,52,23 February 2020
Alexander," Alexander
","With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",6,43,47,22 February 2020
The Mummy," I love this movie so much!
",A real romp of an adventure/horror genre with a wonderful aesthetic that works perfectly and he period setting is pure genius at creating an immersive world. Performances are terrific with Weisz and Fraser having a blast and a great dynamic. The CGI does look a little outdated and of course brings the overall film down but the humour and the overall tone is balanced brilliantly.,8,37,40,20 February 2020
Troy," One of my favorite movies
","I love this movie, by far my favorite R rated movie and in the running for one of the greatest and most epic in my opinion. The acting, the world-building, the character depth, and the thrill of such an incredible depiction of the time period. I didn't think it was possible to make an accounting of the Trojan war void of the supernatural presence of the Greek Gods that rivals the old story in excellence, but this movie does.",8,61,67,22 February 2020
Terminator Salvation," Salvation
","Terminator Salvation is a mess, one that has no real tension or stakes to its storyline. I respect that they wanted to tell a different story, but it just didn't feel like a Terminator film.",6,47,58,6 March 2020
Aquaman," Aquaman
","Sure, this is no smart or particularly clever film. But you gotta admire how it embraces its comic origins, tacky costumes with colorful oversized helmets, octopuses playing drums, Dolph Lundgren with pink hair, armored sea horses and all. Thankfully it doesn't take itself too seriously and has a pretty charismatic leading man who takes the film through a few silly scenes too. But you can't say you've seen most of this ever before, there are just so many locations, creatures, designs, concepts. It's no short movie by any means, but it's fun from beginning to end. Megalomania done right.",8,43,77,12 February 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," I enjoyed this movie
","This third installment is just as long, fixes some of the damages but adds along new ones. At Worlds End improves on its CGI magic but still possesses that dragging story that is just too long and confusing.",8,45,49,23 February 2020
Deadpool 2," I enjoyed this movie
","Deadpool is a great movie filed with a lot of jokes, however, it is above age 18 in since it contains a lot of bad words. The first movie of Deadpool I did not like a lot, however, the second one was a great movie. The first one was because it did not have a lot of meaning hidden, it was just a Marvel movie, however, the second one was the opposite its main idea was love, and this is the reason that I liked the second one more.",8,47,65,23 February 2020
X-Men," X-Men
","I find X-men a good start to the x-men franchise since it brings the characters we all know in love from the comics or even the old animated TV show of x-men with people like the wolverine, jean grey or mystique, all of which we know from the comics and I get why some people say now that it doesn't really have good CGI anymore but in my opinion I honestly think that it still has good animation till this day. I give X-men 2000 10/10 stars, For its good story and how they put such good casting in this movie.",10,42,45,12 February 2020
Spider-Man 3," I enjoyed this movie
","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive 'Spider-Man' if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",7,56,62,24 February 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Movie in THOR series
","The cast for Thor Ragnarok are all matched well, and the sibling chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth is as natural as can be. Cate Blanchett as Hela, the goddess of death is frightening in her cruelty as well as physical perfection. But, the reason this movie stands alone is the multi talented Taika Waititi, the director of the film. His offbeat New Zealand style shows in every scene, humor throughout and a rocking 80s electronica soundtrack, the film will transport you as fast as Heimdall and the Bitfrost!",9,70,120,23 February 2020
Resident Evil: Extinction," Best of the movie series, but does not make it a good movie.
","The storyline builds quite nicely in the 3rd installment and the addition of a few more known actresses and actors, helps move this film forward. Unfortunately the special effects are still very rudimentary.",6,39,44,21 February 2020
The Terminator," A fantastic SC-FI action thriller!
","'The Terminator' is an incredible and fun Action/Sci-Fi movie of 1984. 'The Terminator's' plot is that a cyborg a.k.a. 'The Terminator' portrayed by 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' time travels from 2029 back to 1984 to murder 'Sarah Connor' portrayed by 'Linda Hamilton'. A savior named 'Kyle Reece' portrayed by 'Michael Biehn' also time travels back to 1984 to save 'Sarah Connor'. The plot is simple yet incredible. There is neither plot holes nor unanswered questions after watching 'The Terminator'. The acting in this movie is perfect 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' was born to play the role of 'The Terminator'. And the one-liner that was repeated over and over again 'I'll be back'. 'Michael Biehn' was amazing playing the role of 'Kyle Reece'. The music in this movie is thrilling to listen to; the climax of the film is incredible thanks to the stunning music composed by 'Brad Fiedel'. 'James Cameron' did an amazing job at directing this movie, and he was great at filming the movie, there are one or two scenes that could've been shot better but only one or two. The special effects in this movie are superb for 1984 for example the scene where the terminator drives the car into the police station. There is one scene that is very bad, this is the scene where the terminator's eye is damaged and he cuts he eye out this scene is bad. If you are a person who enjoys 1980's Sci-Fi/Action films then you should definitely watch 'The Terminator' as it is an exciting and incredible movie. The only issues are the eyeball cutting out scene, one or two scenes shot better and the dialogue been a little less of it repeating itself. I give 'The Terminator' a 10/10.",10,41,50,6 March 2020
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," It's good movie to watch
","Surprisingly good funny action. Selma, girl, cute, was a nice touch. The action is all good, good efffects and a story that held together. It's a bit strange and creepy at times but all in good fun. Many good ideas.",8,37,40,23 February 2020
The Hateful Eight," Great
","Everything you would come to expect from Tarantino, just on a more confined scale. The original screen play and acting both amaze, it is always refreshing to see some of the banter and slang he comes up with. Yes it is super violent but once again the director makes it so we really don't care, the music fits perfect as well.",9,54,67,29 February 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," TINTIN
","Somany great things have been written down for this Movie, that are only few left for me. It is adventures, it is funny and a great journey with Tin Tin and his clever dog Struppi! ....and the captain with his rum. It was just somuch FUN to watch this Movie.",10,42,47,11 February 2020
Fast & Furious 6," One of my favourite Fast and Furious movies

The Expendables," I enjoyed this movie
","A novelty film, the novelty being seeing all of these great action stars together in one big action film. Unfortunately, most of them are past their prime, and it's hard to share the spotlight. The action is great, but it just isn't enough to carry the film this time. The characters and plot just aren't developed enough.",6,38,41,23 February 2020
Blade II," Good action

The Way Back," love this movie highly recommend.
",I think it's always difficult to portray hardship and endurance in films purely because you only experience it for a couple of hours or so. This had me understanding the terrible conditions for real....i think. The search for water in the Gobi desert had me thinking twice about attempting the same thing as a holiday. Make up was fantastic and the bleakness of the scenery was soo beautiful,9,46,50,23 February 2020
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Johnny Depp's greatest movie!!
","'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' is one of the best musical films ever made and probably the last truly excellent Tim Burton effort in directing. It's a romantic and enthralling vision of the dark perspective about life and death for the poor people controled by the privileged, cruel and envious society. It finds a inspired Johnny Depp in probably his best performance of this century. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall compelte this luxury cast, which is one of the most talented one assembled in a musical!",9,46,50,23 February 2020
Underworld Awakening," Underworld

Suicide Squad," I wish I could say otherwise but I can't lie like that.
",A film that utterly lacked any substance. There was promise at the beginning with a great opening introducing us to the anti-heroes which was awesome. And then.... Nothing? Stranded such a talented cast fighting comical looking goons and an anti-climax of a villian. The two stars are for Viola Davis and Margot Robbie who give their roles everything. Every other character is disposable and forgettable. And Jared Leto as the Joker? Lets say no more.,6,66,76,22 February 2020

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Another great film in the MCU
","I always thought Captain America was a corny 'golden age of comics' superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU.",8,50,55,23 February 2020

","More of a coda to Rocky than sparring partner of equal standing, part II nonetheless keeps viewers vested in the continuing saga of the Italian Stallion by deepening the character and then bloodying him up. Taking place immediately after the events of the franchise champ, this chapter asks a lot of the audience, namely cheering for the same fighter in pretty much the same fight with the same opponent even though our titular hero's previous loss defined the character perfectly. Sure, you don't have to win to be a champion, but it's to this powerful sequel's credit that you root for the underdog all over again. Plus, the climactic battle royale makes for some of the most compelling fight scenes ever committed to film. In this PG-rated sports drama, Rocky struggles with family life after his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch. At this juncture, Stallone runs the risk of making a sophomore slump and lessening the emotional blows landed by the first chapter. By giving more screen time to the wonderful Talia Shire as Adrian, he actually develops the title character even more. Their romance is palpable, as is the hard-hitting re-match. Stallone might have taken over directing duties from John G. Avildsen, but he exhibits a confidence that makes the transition seem seamless and even one-ups the intensity on the canvas. Bottom line: Much Punch-Drunk Love",8,36,59,13 February 2020

What follows still isn't predictable here, but takes a lot of effort, sweat and tears. Once the film is over, you realize it played you with the conventions of the sports drama you've seen a few times before. But while you're in it, you're on the edge of the seat and feel for this deeply flawed man and his adorable daughter. That's no small feat.

","'The Godfather: Part II' is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects.

The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",10,55,58,23 February 2020

'Predator' has a great plot to it, which is a group of United States army fighters are sent to a place to retrieve some hostages, later to find out that a 'Predator' is after them one-by-one. The story is great except for a few things that don't make sense, these are toward's the film's climax. The acting in 'Predator' is superb, 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' as always puts 100% into his roles. 'Carl Weathers' is perfect in this film as well. The music in 'Predator' is perfect, it's very suspenseful and fits in perfectly with the scenes. The film is shot great, the camera man did a great job filming this movie. For a film that was made in 1987, 'Predator' has special effects that still look realistic to this day. I highly recommend you watch 'Predator' as it is a superb and exciting action/horror film of 1987.",10,44,49,6 March 2020

So judging by those who gave this movie scathing review, I'd say they didn't read the book and if they did and still didn't get the movie, that's sad on their part.

","Like it's predecessor, the final installment of The Matrix trilogy is overcomplicated in plot, yet even more excessive in CGI. The entire 2nd half of the film is a huge barrage of special effects, and while it's not a huge bore, the brilliant choreography has been sacrificed in it's place; save for the final battle between Mr. Anderson and Mr. Smith, and it's always a pleasure watching the two stars square off.

","The dark tone of 'Man of Steel' probably fits well with some people, but for me, it just seems like they wanted to make Superman the same way Nolan made Batman back in 2005. The darkness of this movie doesn't help the story even the slighest and it actually makes the movie a lot more flat and boring, because it doesn't fit with the character of Superman. The first half of the movie is pretty well-made, but the second and third halves are really just a visual aspect of something that we never asked for.",6,52,78,24 February 2020
The Revenant," love this movie highly recommend.
","Finally saw this movie (yes 4 years late) and I understand why Leonardo won the Oscar, along with the many academy awards the movie and director won. It is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing, the whole cast (Tom Hardy is great here) is great. The costumes and weapons used (early 1800s) look so damn good. The story is very simple and not complicated. It is about revenge and surviving in the cold and icy wilderness of 1823. The action scenes are brutal and gritty, like they should be for that time period. Officially in my top 10 movies of all time. If you've never seen this film, do yourself a favor and rent it or buy it. It definitely deserves to be in your collection. Some people might not like all the spiritual stuff or reading subtitles (lots of Native American language here) but it is needed since there a lot of interaction with Native American tribes here.

Kung Fu Panda 2," Good movie
","Kung Fu Panda 2 was not as good as the original. The story isn't as good and neither is the 'Jack Black humor' that made the original what it was.

Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a good movie, although it fails to be as good as the first.",8,38,41,23 February 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Rise of the Machines
","With no James Cameron involved what so ever with this project. The whole shift of the franchise turned from this film onwards. The biggest problem with this film is the humour, it is cringe to watch, pretty much all the humour falls flat throughout the film. The film also looked like they didn't know what to with the story itself. Arnold's performance looks off a bit, (it was he last big film before he became governor). John Connor is this film is so bad to watch, all he does is complain and it will get on people nerves. The effects are no where as great as T2. Saying that, there are like couple of decent action set pieces, but it doesn't help the movie.",7,42,50,6 March 2020
Wanted," Gleefully fun and thoroughly entertaining.
","'Wanted' is a film that's having too much fun not to like. Who cares about the impossibility of bullet bending when most audiences accept superheroes with inhuman powers and strengths based on comic book characters. As with those comic book films, it's just a work of fiction and fantasy, and since 'Wanted' doesn't take itself at all seriously, then you can suspend utter disbelief. The casting and performances are all spot on, above all James McAvoy who delivers one of his best performances in his career so far, even if the might not be the best film he's been in. Stylish, funny, competently directed and paced, this is a great action flick with an ordinary story that is more than the sum of its parts due to slick a execution.",7,43,48,23 February 2020

Dangal," the best indian movie in the history
","If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",10,47,50,23 February 2020

Edward Scissorhands," One of the greatest fable of the 90s.
","Tim Burton all time favorite artist of all time. Not just one of the greatest directors of all time, not just one of the greatest imaginative writers of all time, not just versatile camera works ever put to film, but a versatile genius of art. That's how I think of Tim Burton. Edward Scissorhands is his personal film that he ever put to film by his heart. When I saw this film for the first time, my heart burst of love. I was always in love with his films, I don't start loving Batman because of him, nightmare before Christmas is my all-time favorite holiday film, Ed wood, Big fish, big eyes, Beetlejuice, Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, all of them. But only one that is true to his heart and that is Edward Scissorhands. Edward Scissorhands is a versatile work of art ever put film, with darkness and colors combined together to make into a perfect rainbow is Edward Scissorhands. As for me this film is a work of art and yet one of my favorite films of all time. This prestige film is my childhood, my everything.

","We waited for years to get a new and better 'Batman' movie than the one we got back in 1997 with 'Batman & Robin' which was a complete disaster. This movie is probably the best of all the 'Batman' movies to ever be released. Christopher Nolan reinvents this iconic character in the most humane way we have ever seen the character in before. It's also the greatest way we have ever seen. Christian Bale is a very good Batman, but I don't believe in his judgment all the time, taking a scene where he is about to kill a man, but fails when the same man is killed by another assassin. I didn't really get his full emotion in that scene, but he is still very good. Liam Neeson is the best villain for Batman to take on as he inhabits the iconic villain Ra's al Ghul who we all know from the comicbooks. This is a great movie that I can't help but love even more every single time I watch the movie.",10,39,41,12 February 2020

Liam Neeson does a great job and keeps you rooting for him the entire film. He gets a great supporting cast as well. Top notch performance by Corey Stoll as the NYPD detective passenger on the plane as well. The only downside to this film was that when the film started it almost seemed like the first 2-4 minutes were cut and just dropped you right into the film. A little confusing but nothing extreme to take away from the rest of the film.",8,38,42,20 February 2020
Saving Private Ryan," A war film you simply can't miss.
","Possibly the most realistic depiction of gruesome war shown in film in Spielberg's yet another addition to his perfect films collection. I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.",10,50,54,23 February 2020

","A great adaptation of the source material makes for a very entertaining and violent ride. Begs the question, what would a superhero be like in real life?

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," totally forgettable movie
","With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy.",6,49,59,23 February 2020

","Different than the first. I'm not going to say that I fully enjoyed watching it though. I do think that the production levels have stepped up a notch, the werewolves provide a nice touch to the ever dreary lens of Forks and surprisingly, Kristen Stewart is quite convincing as the heart broken Bella. But this is too long, too dull, with only a couple of scenes that ignite any real sense of danger and an ending that is contrived in the way that it sets up to the next installment.",6,39,42,20 February 2020

","I guess 'the powers that be' decided that they could jump start this franchise better if they dabbled into the 'cosmic Marvel universe' and brought in the Silver Surfer. What they got was a film that was worse than the original. The Silver Surfer is a great character but used like this it was just not effective and somehow Mark Frost wrote a worse script than before. Effects, again, were the highlight of this film. Also, Laurence Fishburne voices the Silver Surfer.",6,38,42,24 February 2020
Transformers," Transformers
","Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up for the exciting and action packed blockbuster Transformers. Earth becomes caught up in a war between two groups of alien robots that have come in search of a device that gave life to their planet. That cast includes Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, John Turturro, and Jon Voight, who all bring a certain charisma to the film. But the real stars of the film are the special effects, which are amazing. And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged. Transformers is messy and cheesy, and sophomoric...but it's also a lot of fun and immensely entertaining.",8,41,45,5 March 2020
Men in Black II," Not near as good as the first one

","Absolutely incredible - I've seen it 3 times in cinemas and each time I find myself even more in awe of, blown away by, and in love with this film. It's thrilling, tense, gentle, satisfying, and deeply beautiful. As a huge fan of the war genre, this is unlike any other film I've ever seen - it finds its true strength in its unexciting, human moments rather than in the mindless chaos of firefights, while still managing to have some of the most exhilarating and edge-of-your-seat segments I've ever seen. Schofield is a brilliant and unconventional choice for the lead character, and his empathy and softness have made him one of my favourite characters of all time and an exceptionally rare example of how quiet tenderness truly can carry a war film better than loud banter and hyper-masculine bluster so often does. Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a genius and George Mackay said so much more in Schofield's silence than most actors could hope to in the grandest monologue. A masterpiece.",10,103,154,10 February 2020
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not a good movie, honestly.
","This is a bad film, I know that right off the bat. Some pretty bad acting, camera work and scene slow-mo, ridiculous action parts, like Alice jumping 30 feet in the air over a fence.

Dumb and Dumber," Dumb and Dumber
","In my opinion the greatest comedy ever made! Daniels and Carrey work magic together in this film that more than 20 years later is finally considered a classic. When it first came out it was labeled as complete garbage and toilet humour. But to those people I say it is the best garbage and toilet humour you could ask for. What do you expect to see when the title of the film is ''Dumb and Dumber''. The quick back and forth between the two lead actors and not so subtle chirping often goes unnoticed because your'e laughing so hard from the previous scene.the jokes and dialogue are so good and Carey and Daniels deliver them with such authenticity. It's because of this reason that I am able to watch this movie countless times and still be entertained, as I listen to funny remarks that I missed on the previous 100 viewings. What's truly great about this film is that even people who say they hate it will always without fail crack a laugh or two when re-watching it. They just don't want to admit that they find this nonsense to be funny...but it is. More than 20 years later and I still have not seen a buddy comedy that comes close to matching it.",10,52,58,5 February 2020
Brave," Great
","A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",8,41,44,21 February 2020
Clash of the Titans," Not as good as the classic Clash of the Titans
",The Clash of the Titans remade is more like a brute version of it. It's fun but its a mess. It's more of a spectacle rather than telling a story bout the whole mythology epic with its characters though I'm seeing a lot of CGI extravaganza with over the top results which my eyes are bleeding like hell . This is one of those films where there are a lot of super good casts in a bad production.,6,37,40,23 February 2020

","The Good: 1. Acting, i should say that this is one of the best performances for both leading actors. Hugh Jackman was incredible. 2. Plot and characterization, well i can expected that by seeing the director's name. One of the best crime-thriller ever made, keep you sucked into the plot. 3. Cinematography, genius Deakins success to build the tense of the film only by his work. Film atmosphere was really good. The Bad: Overlong and the original score not pretty good to lived up the film. I mean, Johann was a really good composer, especially his work in Sicario and Arrival, but it's not work here.

Hotel Mumbai," Hotel Mumbai
","Movies like Hotel Mumbai always fascinate me because I always wonder how I would react if I was in the center of an attack. Would I keep my calm and help, or would I freak out and endanger everyone? This movie Directed by Anthony Maras, in his directorial debut, has a number of characters that grapple with that idea. Hotel Mumbai is a story about one of the locations that was attacked during the 2008 Mumbai Terrorist attacks. We learn the story of the heroic efforts of the staff of the Taj Hotel attempting to save almost 100 lives during the attack. The set up is simple, you have the calm before the storm, the attack, and the response by unassuming heroes. The execution of the direction of this movie is extremely high. The acting, the camera work, and the score were all top level and it really made this an extremely intense, but fulfilling movie. Stock Watch Stock Up - Dev Patel always is great in anything he is in: see Slumdog, or the Newsroom, or Lion. So it was no surprise to see him as the heart of this movie and carry a lot of the emotional weight of the story. He straddles the balance of helping all the victims, while simultaneously trying to make it home alive to his family. I hope he starts getting more mainstream roles because I think he is a star. He keeps his composure the entire time and keeps the audience calm in a way as well. It is really a fantastic role. Stock Neutral - Armie Hammer was as solid as he always is in his acting roles. However, he just did not have an insane amount to do in this one. Every scene he was in though was great and was brought more to life because of his presence. *A couple other tidbits - Why is Nazanin Boniadi not in more movies? She is always great in anything she is in so I hope to see her more often. - This movie is rated R for a reason, it is very intense and very graphic. Hard to watch at some points. - The villain in this was extremely creepy and has stuck with me for sure. This is a movie that is very hard to watch, but it is worth watching. These attacks were extremely disgusting acts, the acts of heroism however show the best in humanity. I am happy this movie exists and I just hope people can watch this and learn something about themselves from it",10,58,108,10 February 2020

","What makes this film stand out, aside from its superb effects, humor and script, is the contrast between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.

These 'Men In Black' are on a mission to save Earth from a really, really nasty bug infestation. This is one Sci-Fi film that shouldn't be missed.",9,39,43,22 February 2020

","The Mummy Returns is a film that, I think, you need to see the first film of the saga because otherwise you don't understand some little details. That film is a film like Indiana Jones with the same plot and the same characters. But the kid is an exception. The cinema show us the kids like boys and girls insufferable, but Alex O'Conell is a boy that 'pass more time in the museum that in house'. One difference this film have respect Indiana Jone's films are the sobrenatural characters than appears like The Scorpión King or Imhotep.

","A fascinating and inspiring epic, The Last Samurai is a powerful film. The story follows a disillusioned Civil War veteran who's recruited to train the Japanese army in Western warfare as they prepare to take on a Samurai rebellion. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe lead the cast and give excellent performances. The directing is also quite remarkable, and captures the spiritual aspects of nature and of the Samurai culture. Additionally, the writing does an effective job at depicting the culture clashes, and at developing the characters. The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliantly done as well, perfectly complementing the film and enhancing the themes. The Last Samurai is a smart and passionate drama that's well-crafted and compelling.",10,40,64,4 February 2020

The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect.

There are multiple movies on his resumé that could have easily been thrown out of the window. 'Rocky' is definitely not that movie! This is a movie that he wrote and starred in and showed his talent on both sides of the camera. It is a classic, but beautiful story about the hero who fails but still gets the girl in the end. Stallone plays the main character of Rocky Balboa and he shows all of his talents this time around. He proves that he is someone who is to be taken serious by the audience. The supporting cast, which includes stars like Talia Shire, Carl Weathers and Burgess Meredith helps the story forward and helps give our main guy a good sense of accomplishment in the end. Oh, and a lot of challenges! The twist to the classic love-rival story, ended up being one of the most successful accomplishments of all time. Who would have known...??",10,38,60,13 February 2020

Sicario," Sicario
","Sicario was first released back in 2015. I just watched it for the first time last week...and I really have no excuse other than I'm an idiot. I knew I'd like it, I'd heard nothing but amazing things, and five minutes into the movie I completely regretted not watching it sooner. Sicario is, hands down, one of the best action/thrillers of the decade. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to create so much suspense and intensity throughout 120 minutes that at times it's almost unbearable. Needless to say, my fingernails did not survive this movie. The plot itself is fairly basic - the FBI teams up with some shady people to fight a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Emily Blunt plays the young FBI agent recruited into the fight, and for most of the movie the audience is just as confused and suspicious as she is. It delivers plenty of wonderful 'what the hell?' moments, as you never really get a sense of anyone's true motivations until the end. The performances are universally terrific and the dialogue is sharp, but the main reason the movie works so masterfully is Villeneuve. With the help of some striking cinematography and a brilliant score, he gives us one of the most surprising, tense, and atmospheric thrillers in the history of the genre. If you've never seen Sicario, please don't make my mistake and see it ASAP.",10,83,93,14 February 2020

","One of, if not, the best Disney films ever made. The vocal talents of James Woods, Danny DeVito, Tate Donovan, and Rip Torn are all spot on. The music isn't the best work Disney has put out, but the movie itself is downright amazing. The tale of a son trying to regain his heroism to return home is one that has been told before. However, the way this one is told just feels fresh and new. James Woods as Hades is perfect casting. It is on the level as James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Hades. Great job Disney on this perfection. If anyone likes Greek mythology then this is a great, kid friendly, version of it.",10,41,44,21 February 2020
Joker," Great
","I'm speechless. This is one of my favorite movies , and it's the best. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Yes, I think he should absolutely win an Oscar for his portrayal as the iconic character. Heath Ledger is still my favorite Joker, but Joaquin is pretty close to the level of Ledger. Todd Phillips did a phenomenal job directing, I think this is his best work to date. Robert De Niro is not given much screen time, but he takes advantage of the time he's given, and he shines. The costume design and makeup is great as well, and I think it should be nominated for a major award. The script is incredible, I'm going to be quoting a lot of the lines for days. The violence in this movie was not even that bad, compared to other films that have had this amount of controversy. I would like to take a minute and say, that films and other media do not cause violence, this is not a 'dangerous film.' The last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely insane, I won't be able to forget them. The death scene on the Murray Franklin Show, is absolutely crazy, and I did not see it coming. Despite the fact that Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mass murderer, I couldn't help but feel bad for his character at times. I didn't forgive him for the things he did, but at the same time, I did sympathize with him. I really liked the progression of Arthur's character. You see him slowly growing more and more insane as the seconds go by. The runtime was perfect it never felt boring.

","I saw this without any foreknowledge of the story despite its history. As a Brannagh admirer I also expected a lot. As such it was a great performance by a great cast. Those who didnâ(TM)t like it perplex me. This is not a modern crime story with action or violence or explosions to distract us. Like Sherlock Homes, Poirot is detective who use his mind and observation skills rather than physical action and violence to solve his case. The filming is perfect, the pace slow and steady, the denouement handled with precision. If you go into this expecting a James Bond type movie ( which I really like precisely because it they are full of action and spectacle but not too much intellectual input !), you will be disappointed. But if you expect to have your mind intrigued and you like to solve crime, then you will not be disappointed. I suspect it will be more enjoyable if you have no idea as to the true plot line, so if you have read the story in the past, it would help if you do not re-read it and you have forgotten some of the details.",9,53,88,22 February 2020

Since it's based off of 'true events', it makes it even more interesting. I can't quite give it a full 10 star rating because it does have quite a few jump scares, but at least a good portion of those jump scares add to the atmosphere of this movie. If you are a first time watcher of this movie, it will certainly disturb you for a while.

The visuals are great (although at the end I question the CGI for Ares) but the reason I'm giving it only 9 stars is because the villains are nothing to write home about.

","I love this movie! It was so adorable, so charming & the writing was absolutely terrific! I love the animation & the characters (including the minions) were all fantastic! A MUST WATCH!",8,33,36,21 February 2020
Taken 2," Taken
","The sequel which could have started off one of the best action franchises of all time but ultimately fell flat. The movie is poorly directed by Olivier Megaton who over used shaky cam, the writing is cliched and stupid but to be honest I can't help but like it for being so bad, there is some redeeming factors like Liam Neeson who always puts in a great performance but overall the film is stupid and that's why I like it.",6,41,45,20 February 2020
X-Men: First Class," X-Men
","With Matthew Vaughn at the helm, X-Men: First Class is a classy, fun time that brings the best out of it's strong cast. The action scenes and dialogue pop with a ferocity, and breaths life into a incredibly engaging storyline.",8,44,48,12 February 2020
Fifty Shades of Grey," Do not watch this film, it is bad.
",Well I thought I would see what all the fuss was about and boy did I wish I hadn't I have seen very bad romantic comedies that are better than this film,2,58,69,16 February 2020
The Wolverine," The Wolverine
",Wolverine plus Samurai makes a pretty good combination for me. A great film that is based on the X-Men comic books and movie series.,8,43,58,12 February 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman
","Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. It's emotional, intense and has a great villain in Tom Hardy.",10,54,57,12 February 2020
Black Panther," Not the best ones of the Marvel package.... ! boring.
","'Black Panther' is a popcorn movie nothing more nothing less. Although It trys to grasp at the idea of western colonialism and racism, it only scratches the surface never really deciding were it stands. Although this has been championed as one of they greatest diverse films it is not and I would recommend you to check out '12 years a Slave' , 'Get Out' or 'Moonlight' who do a much better job than this meager attempt. The plot is by the numbers the direction is nothing special. Chadwick Boseman's acting is rather stilted and you can never attach to his character. Michael B Jordan is a one note villian who also struggles, phoning in a performance spouting monologues about messages that never really click. But where the movie really falls on its face is the third act which is cgi heavy and looks like its out of a video game. Black Panther by no means is terrible its below average and the concept of Wakanda is an excellent and well excuted idea. But this movie just needs to go that little bit deeper and seprate itself from the tired superhero formula.",7,87,121,21 February 2020
Iron Man," Best movie of a hero's origin.
","Great movie, which serves as a perfect introduction to Tony Stark's character. The antagonist was a bit boring, but except for that, I loved the movie!",9,46,49,22 February 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not the worst film ever but it could be better.
","This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted.",6,79,103,23 February 2020
Casino Royale," 007
","Daniel Craig's debut as 007 which he knocked out of the park. A very grounded, smart, realistic James Bond film. Casino Royale is debatably for most fans the best Bond film and I can honestly view this film as a movie of its own to be honest. Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery.",10,70,78,13 February 2020
Toy Story 3," Best animated movies ever made
",Toy Story 3 in my opinion is by far the best of the trilogy! It is the most emotionally investing out of all the Toy Story installments and is an outstanding entry to the Pixar library!,10,38,41,15 February 2020
Beowulf," Decent movie
","It takes a while for your eyes to get used to the uncanny animation, but once you overcome the ordeal, Beowulf turns into an outrageously entertaining ride. The performances are solid, the visuals are unique, the score is uplifting, and it has great action sequences. It's really good fun for adults of all ages.",8,39,42,23 February 2020
X2: X-Men United," X-Men
","With more confident direction, a more ambitious story, and impressively realized action set pieces, X2 is the rare sequel that improves on every aspect of the original - while also working as a great stand alone movie in it's own right.",9,39,42,12 February 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Thor
","Is this a huge stepup from the original 'Thor' movie. No, unfortunately not. Is it another watchable, fun superhero movie; yes, definitely. It's a really good movie and if we look at the way Alan Taylor directs this movie, it's actually not that much different from what Branagh did back in 2011. Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation.",7,43,47,24 February 2020
Cinderella," The classic princess movie that people still watch
","The classic Disney film, Cinderella sets the standard for years to come with its imaginative animation style, fun characters, and enchanting songs. Animators find a good balance between the silly gags of the mice characters and the enchanting scenes with Cinderella and her path from rags to riches. Some notably colorful characters like the king and Lady Tremaine help support the story with originality, though some characters like the Prince and the fairy godmother probably deserved some more screen time. Either way, the movie kept us captivated with its wonderful visuals, refined humor and compelling storyline.",10,35,37,21 February 2020
RED," Red
","I love it when I watch a movie and the cast seems to be having loads of fun in it, and with a cast like this one, it is really fun to watch. Red isn't revolutionary by any means, but it has the feeling of being very rewatchable for me. I throughly enjoyed the great special effects and the over the top, but still fun action. Red is the definition of a fun film to watch, but it doesn't quite live up to what it could be, still a very good time though",8,35,37,21 February 2020

The Matrix," One of the best action sci fi action movies of all time!

Deadpool," Great movie, funny, good story, a must see
","Before Logan, this was my favorite non-MCU marvel movie. The humor lands every single time thanks to Ryan Reynolds' charismatic and hysterical performance. The action was really well-helmed, which i think benefits from the fact that none of it is censored (disney if u make DP3 don't censor it). It also does a great job fleshing out Wade Wilson's character, instead of making him a service-level comedian; they showed us his prior life and love life, and it was executed very well. Overall, this is a badass and hilarious x-men film, and a really damn good time.",9,41,64,23 February 2020
300," 300
","300 tells the story of the 300 Spartans who defended their homes against the Persian army. The movie is a phenomenal action packed story that sticks pretty close to the actual events. The movie is done in a style similar to a graphic novel which adds high contrast and beautiful slow motion scenes. Overall, the movie is incredibly entertaining and tells a fascinating story.",8,44,63,22 February 2020
Tarzan," Great way to close out the renaissance.
","Tarzan (1999) - is the final movie in the Disney Renaissance and it certainly was a great note to leave on. The story is very basic and easy to follow but they allow so much to happen when it comes to character development and showing off the incredible surroundings of the jungle. All the characters are very memorable and I especially love the way they work Tarzan and Jane's relationship. I love how each of them work of each other and how Jane helps Tarzan understand the ways of the human life. The gorillas also have their moments of tenderness and I do like how each of their views of Tarzan are well understandable. I kinda will admit that the villain is sort of weak but he still acts as a major threat to Tarzan even though it's kinda obvious how Disney is hiding the fact that he's really a villain and not a good guy. The way they work the animation is absolutely incredible. it is just mind blowing and how they manage to combine hand-drawn animation with CGI effects. It makes the look of the jungle feel so immersive and lifelike. The action scenes definitely are proof of how great the animation is and it moves at such a fast and steady pace. it's probably some of the most action pack stuff I've ever seen in a hand drawn film. The overall music score is great for setting the mood and any type of scene. Whether there's a heartfelt scene or an action-packed sequence, the music is always there to accompany whatever is happening on screen. Phil Collins wrote and performed a few songs for the movie and I think all of them are heartfelt and catchy. They are all greatly separated from one another and they play their part whenever the moment is right. I love this movie for a lot of reasons but overall, it's just an outstanding piece of magic to behold.",10,37,40,21 February 2020
Fast Five," Best Fast & Furious movie
",This is the best Fast and furious movie in my opinion. The franchise reinvented itself here and the series really benefited from it. This had a much better and believable plot and of course the Rock made the movie really good as well. 8.5/10,8,46,58,23 February 2020
Green Book," Green Book
","This film proves why movies can be so powerful with a touching, poignant and some times funny story of opposites attract. Enjoyed every moment although it isn't always easy to watch. Mortenson and Ali shine and there are strong supporting roles as well.",10,72,78,14 February 2020
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Four
","Competent entertainment, and a fun feuding dynamic between youngish heroes not quite ready for the limelight, but it's basically just the Marvel Origin Story Template applied once more. Jessica Alba can't act, but Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom is one of the better villain performances in this stable.",6,37,40,24 February 2020
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Eclipse
","Eclipse is the beset Twilight movie so far and now I'm starting to give this series a little mercy. Yes, the writing is still bad, the CGI is awful, there's no chemistry between the leads, there's a lot of laughable dialogue, and terrible characters, but I enjoyed the movie and that's what movies are supposed to do. I'm actually going to watch the next movie with an open mind even if this movie wasn't that good.",6,40,43,20 February 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Great
","In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.",10,54,66,23 February 2020
Aladdin," My favorite animated movie.
","From start to finish, Aladdin is timeless classic! Very funny, very exciting and intense, amazing visuals, and excellent pacing! The story is also amazing, as are the characters. Holy crap do the characters in this movie rock! They all play a very important role in the movie. You have Aladdin and Abu as two fearless adventurers/thieves, Jasmine as one of the best and most charming Disney princesses of all time, Jafar as the highly cunning, intelligent, and awesome sorcerer and one of the best Disney villains of all time, Iago, who has to be the best henchman of any villain in any movie (he and Jafar are the best together), and of course, the Genie. From his design to his style to pretty much everything there is about him, he absolutely steals the show! From the moment he appears during the movie, he is just seems so much like the the star of the movie. Robin Williams as the Genie is one of the best performances in any animated movie. Aladdin is such an awesome movie that I can't give it anything other than 10 out of 10",10,36,38,21 February 2020
Rockstar," Rockstar
","Not as bad as some people made it out to be. Great acting by most...even Nargis Fakhri isn't too weird. The script was criticized as weak by many, but I think it requires a certain sympathy on ones part to really understand the characters and their feelings and actions.",7,42,47,8 March 2020
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Madagascar
",Actually the best of the three. Had more laughs and heart than the other two films combined.,8,42,45,17 February 2020
Spectre," 007
",Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.,9,52,66,13 February 2020
Braveheart," 'Every man dies, not every man really lives.'
","The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.",10,54,59,24 February 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," One of the greatest action films
","George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.",10,54,78,23 February 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge
","Another WWII movie but instead of D-Day and the Battle of Dunkirk, it's the Battle of Okinawa in Japan. Which means, new branch of military and new settings. Usually I want war movies to focus on the historical accuracies and action rather than characters, but this movie changed my opinion. It tells the story of Desmond Doss and his life and how he joined the army, that was very interesting and well-acted. The beginning explained our main character and introduced all the others, who are also a good addition. BUT the rest of the movie is awesome. The battle scene is engaging, heart-wrenching, and epic. It is very gruesome, some may not like that, but that's how it actually happened - when you get hit with a bullet, there's going to be blood. The fight portrayed Desmond's goal and his heart to save others, which you have to respect. Not only does this movie provide adrenaline, but also a learning experience.",10,49,53,11 February 2020
Warcraft," Good
","I had no idea what was going on most of the time because I'm not particularly familiar with Warcraft's story. That being said, this is a decent movie, especially considering it's a video game franchise film...90% of the time video game films are very badly adapted to the screen.",7,44,49,29 February 2020
Me Before You," Fantastic Romantic Movie
","Absolutely brilliant film. Those who criticise it for dealing with the subject of disabilty should look past the fact Will is disabled and look at the film in the light of what it aims to be, a touching, romance film. Emelia Clarke is great. Sam Claflin is brilliant. A definite must see film.",8,51,55,16 February 2020
Gladiator," Great
","Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. 'Are you not entertained?!'",10,54,57,24 February 2020
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers
","Not as fun as the first one, but definitely a step up from Revenge of the Fallen and a fine way to end a trilogy of Shia Lebouf.",7,41,44,5 March 2020
Macbeth," Macbeth
","William Shakespeare's famous tragedy is brought to the screen on a large scale. Full of his intricate and unique style of writing, this play focuses on Macbeth.
....
What I did not expect to see is that the landscape of Scotland becomes not just the scenery background but one of the main storytelling streams. One sees too many modern adaptations of Japanese interpretation of Macbeth that one seems to forget where the story came from in the first place. Truly magnificent cinematography in this version of Macbeth and it really lives up to bloodbath on the battlefields as stated in the Bard' s words. One of the best movies in 2015",8,39,42,13 February 2020
The Pursuit of Happyness," Best movie ever. recommend 100%
","In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes.",10,49,53,23 February 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones
",So how do you return a franchise to it's successful past? Apparently bring back most of the cast from the first movie and the Nazis but add Sean Connery. This movie is as good if not even just a little bit better than the original. The interaction between Ford and Connery is amazing and makes for an enjoyable film. The action and story in this is great. This time (back to looking for Christian artifacts) Indy is out to find his father who went missing while looking for the Holy Grail.,10,40,47,6 March 2020
The Great Gatsby," The Great Gatsby
",I've read The great Gatsby book several times and I watch the original movie before Han d. Of the two movies this one really captures the essence of the book. On people complain about the narration but it was only solution to really accurately convey the story. The parties are epic and that's what I kind of felt they were in the book. DiCaprio deserves more credit.,8,58,65,15 February 2020
Warm Bodies," Enjoyable zombie flick with comedic elements.
","A genuinely pleasant surprise! Here's a film that takes a dead-on-arrival plot (no pun intended) and turns it into something that is fresh for the uber-popular zombie genre. While the film gets off to a slow start and the acting can be *ahem* stiff at times, we as an audience are invested in this endearing and lovely relationship between the zombie, R, and his living girlfriend, Julie. We want to see them live happily together and survive in the odd, post-apocalyptic conditions that plague their world. I also can't help but dig the nice use of music in this film. Nice work!",8,45,49,4 March 2020
Cinderella Man," Best boxing movie made.
","Truly inspiring story of James J. Braddock. This story is about more than boxing. It is about a man and his wife trying to raise a family in the tough times of the 1920s. And the integrity and example he shows his children in those times. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are just part of this incredible cast. It is a must see.",10,37,39,21 February 2020
V for Vendetta," V
","Some of the action might be a bit choppy, but V for Vendetta is extremely entertaining. Its great visual effects and Hugo Weaving's iconic portrayal of 'V' is more than enough to satisfy even the strictest of viewers. There is also a great message about rising up against political propaganda within its great style and environment. Another great film from the Wachowski's is now on your hands.",10,47,55,11 February 2020
