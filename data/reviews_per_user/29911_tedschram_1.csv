Requiem for a Dream," great acting, but some characters are a little unrealistic
","I thought this was a very good movie, well acted, and with an important point to get across, which it mostly succeeded in getting across. In reviews for 'Spun', which this movie is sometimes compared to, people would say that Requiem is the better of the two. Requiem is more serious while Spun is more comical. Both movies, I feel, have some issues with plot and character writing. For instance, I find Mrs. Golfarb's shallowness and weaknesses and childlike obsession with the red dress and the TV show and all a little hard to believe. I've known some 60-year old ladies who are nothing like that! Also, the speed with which she gets committed at the end of the movie, it just seems a little unrealistic. It got the point across, and her acting was so good that it wasn't too distracting while I was watching it, but now that I think about it, it does take away from the overall impact of the film.Since Spun takes a more comic angle, they can be a little looser with reality.",8,0,1,24 November 2005
