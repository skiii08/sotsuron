The King's Speech," One man, a speech therapist, made a difference in history
","While I enjoy movies involving superheroes and science fiction such as Star Wars and Star Trek, there is a place in my heart for the intelligent movie with no violence. Especially those that require some knowledge of the history of the topic in order to fully understand them. This is such a movie and I could not have enjoyed the backdrop of history more than I did.
When British King George V died, at first the succession went smoothly, he was succeeded by his eldest son, who became King Edward VIII. However, Edward became infatuated with the divorced Mrs. Wallis Simpson and wanted to marry her. With the British government and those of the Dominions vehemently opposed to such an event, Edward chose abdication over the throne. This meant that his younger brother Albert, known as Bertie, ascended to the throne as George VI. A nearly lifelong stutterer, George VI found it nearly impossible to deliver a coherent speech.
Fortunately, Bertie had sought the assistance of speech therapist Lionel Logue and this is the story of their relationship and the time when Britain faced the existential crisis of war with Nazi Germany and her allies. It is a great story, for it gives insight into the history of the time. Edward VIII had many sympathies for Germany, in fact, the Nazis tried to use him as a pawn in their battle to defeat England. Meanwhile, George VI proved to be a powerful rallying symbol for the British nation as well as the Dominions.
One aspect that I really enjoyed was the depiction of Depression era England, where the people (even members of the Royal family) wore very thick winter clothing indoors due to the poor heating. To modern people, the crisis over Wallis Simpson seems overblown, but it is very well explained in this movie. The performances are all first rate and the relationships of all British subjects to their king is well done.",10,0,0,14 January 2020
Black Swan," More psycho than sexual
","On the cover, this is called a 'psychosexual thriller.' It is far more psycho than sexual, I found it difficult to watch in time units greater than 20 minutes. Natalie Portman stars as Nina, a ballerina that is extremely talented, but even more unstable. She tries out for the lead role in 'Swan Lake' to be performed by the New York Ballet company. Vincent Cassel plays the intense, hard-driving artistic director, pushing Nina hard. He even engages in what is clearly sexual harassment in his attempts to get Nina to rise to the level of a star. It is clear that sex is not his goal, his mind is on the ballet. Nina lands the role, yet she has not a moment of peace from that point on.
It is clear early in the film that Nina suffers from a serious case of mental illness, she lives with her mother and her mother is not the most stable of individuals. There are many times in the movie where there is action where the viewer is uncertain whether it is real or a wild vision in Nina's mind. All are resolved, but they are very intense and really creepy. At one point, it seems likely that Nina is going to murder her mother. It has been some time since I watched a movie that gave me cold chills, there were many in this one. It is a movie that will make nightmares and it is about ballet, which is somewhat of an odd thought.",10,1,1,7 January 2020
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Mutant powers enhanced by science
","Wolverine likely has the most volatile, dynamic personality of all the X-Men. While he is a mutant in the sense that he has incredible recuperative powers, the physically indestructible characteristics of his powers derived from metal were made by science not nature. As is often the case with stories like this, they are the consequences of a secret government program to create a super soldier. In such stories, it is necessary to have a powerful and ruthless villain that is the government agent overseeing the program. This story has that character.
Logan has a brother that shares his recuperative powers and the opening has them fighting side-by-side in many wars. When the major wars are over and the only fighting to be done is for hire, the two brothers join a mercenary band of mutants. They track down the Earth point of origin of a meteor and when the order is to slaughter all the inhabitants of a village in Africa, Logan walks away from the mission and the group. He 'retires' to a logging job in Canada, but as expected, there is no retirement from his previous line of work.
There is a great deal of action, a lot of subterfuge and some superb special effects. The government program involves the capture and control of many mutants, which leads to the major logical hole in the plot. Professor Xavier appears to take them to his special school only after they have all been released from government control. Which implies that Xavier either did not know of their imprisonment or did so and waited until they were freed. Both of which are logically untenable given Xavier's significant mental powers.
That weakness aside, this is an action movie derived from the comics that remains true to the original story. It also explains Logan's attitude towards the world and his having no memory of his past.",8,0,2,26 August 2019
We Were Soldiers," The start of Americanization of the Vietnam War
","This is a powerful movie in many aspects. The first is the dramatic war action where the combat deaths of thousands of men are depicted. It is brutal, savage and unforgiving, just as close quarter combat is. The second is the undercurrent of how the U. S. military made some colossal mistakes in its prosecution of the war. The battle being depicted is one where the new style of American cavalry, flying into combat on helicopters, is being developed. The third aspect is the home front, where the wives of the men in the unit are being notified of their deaths in combat by telegram delivered by a cabdriver.
Mel Gibson plays U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, the leader of a battalion being trained for air cavalry operations. He is also an academic and has studied the massacre of a French unit by the Viet Minh in 1954. He is determined to avoid the mistakes of the French, where they did not know the terrain and had no intelligence regarding the strength of the opposing forces.
When Moore's 400 man unit is dropped into an area where an American base has been attacked, the American commanders have no idea regarding the number of enemy forces in the area. When a soldier of the North Vietnamese Army is captured, he reveals that the immediate area is the base for a unit of over 4,000 men. Immediately understanding their predicament, Moore prepares his men for a major battle. The action is fierce, yet the Americans hold on, largely due to the American aerial firepower. Orders come down that make no sense to Moore and he ignores them.
This movie is based on the battle of Ia Trang Valley, the first major engagement between U. S. forces and those of North Vietnam. In terms of casualties, it was an American victory, as nearly 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed. Yet, it was a learning experience for the North Vietnamese commanders, from that point they realized that they must proceed with caution in engaging in a major battle with U. S. forces. The ability of American commanders to call in devastating air strikes meant that anything approaching a siege was suicide.
This movie also depicts what was one of the primary U. S. tactics. Occupy a region, engage in a firefight, hold it for awhile and then pull out. It was not a war where both sides moved forces along a front in order to expand the territory that they controlled. The ending is powerful as it shows Moore walking up to the section of the Vietnam Memorial wall where the names of the fallen of his unit are etched in stone.",10,0,0,25 April 2020
Crash," The good do some bad and the bad some good
","This is a powerful movie; the good guys are not all good and the bad guys are not all bad. Racism is present in many ugly forms, although some of the worst practitioners take advantage of their chance to repent and make amends. It a movie without a true leading role, although there are several movie stars in the cast.
Some of the best scenes involve the machinations that people have to go through in order to get through their life, do their job or see that some justice is done. There is a district attorney concerned only with his re-election prospects and his overtly racist, self-centered wife, two partnered street cops and a black senior detective, a shop owner that is vandalized and seeks revenge against a locksmith and several other supporting characters that add a great deal of power. This is one of those movies where all are supporting characters and all performances are outstanding.
The good do some bad and the bad do some good, the interconnections of all the characters makes for a story with surprises that are uplifting and then crash you down. Whatever your final position is, this movie will not leave you unchanged as it gives you perspectives on the racist undercurrent of American society.",10,0,0,21 March 2020
Full Metal Jacket," Male bonding in the highest form
","The star of this movie is the drill instructor (D.I.) for the boot camp attended by the group of men that signed up for the United States Marine Corps. He is always verbally and occasionally physically savage to the men as he pulls apart their feelings and turns them into automatons that are at one with their rifles. It is interesting that Lee Erney, the man that played the D.I., was in fact a drill instructor during the Vietnam War and much of his dialog was ad lib. When the men are in boot camp, there are times when you empathize with them.
The war action is just as gritty, the last section of the movie is set in the Vietnamese city of Hue during the Tet Offensive when it was overrun by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. The set is so real that once I was done watching the movie, I went to a search engine to find out where the scenes were shot. I have watched actual footage of the battle for Hue and the reality is uncanny.
The story follows a group of young men that join the Marines and proceed through boot camp before being sent to Vietnam to fill various roles. After some time in country, a few of them are reunited in the battle for Hue. Despite their now brutal personalities, they show tenderness towards each other as only fellow soldiers in battle can.
This is a great movie that shows war at the lowest levels and male camaraderie in its' highest form.",10,1,1,4 April 2020
The Aviator," Hughes should be a technological legend
","As a technocrat, I have followed the professional lives of the people that have made the modern computer industry. Individuals such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison and Elon Musk. They are hard-driving people that had great vision, but personalities and egos that were abrasive, to say the least. Much earlier, there was another person in this mold, and his name was Howard Hughes. This movie is an expression of his life, successes and failures.
DiCaprio puts forward a superb performance as the mercurial, yet brilliant Hughes. In watching the movie, it was easy to project some of what has been written about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and simply replace Hughes with either of those two men.
Of course, there are two significant differences. The first is that Hughes was at his base a test pilot and a very good one. No one ever questioned his courage and willingness to take great personal risk. The second was that Hughes was also an integral part of the Hollywood movie making scene, which made him top notch fodder for the tabloids.
This is a great movie about one of the most underappreciated visionaries of the twentieth century. It is unfortunate that his great flaws were self-destructive, in the sense that they made it impossible for him to function in society in his last years. Had he remained socially and professionally functional, he may have been the greatest of all time.",10,1,1,18 December 2019
Cast Away," The ultimate survivor
","Literally from the moment when humans began traveling the seas and oceans out of the sight of land, there have been tales of people being shipwrecked and marooned. Sometimes it is small groups of people on an uninhabited island, other times there are natives on the island and in a few cases, it is one person all alone. Different and more expanded versions of this story arose in science fiction after interplanetary travel became plausible. The recent hit movie 'The Martian' is the best-known example of the lone person marooned.
This movie is one where a single person somehow manages to survive a destructive plane crash and wash up on the beach of an uninhabited tropical island. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Nolan, an engineer with FedEx that is a hard driving, yet somewhat personable individual. He is flying as a passenger in a company cargo jet when they encounter a violent storm and there is an onboard explosion of some kind.
Once on the island, Nolan needs to immediately satisfy his basic needs of food, water and shelter. He struggles to get a fire going, open a coconut and other basic tasks with no modern tools. Fortunately, a few packages from the plane wash up on the beach and he finds some useful items in them. After four years, he realizes that if he does not leave the island, he will die there alone and largely forgotten.
This movie is nearly all Tom Hanks and he does a superb job of playing the increasingly eccentric exile in an odd form of solitary confinement. In order to keep himself sane, he must go a little insane, inventing a semi-imaginary companion to talk to. It is a worthy addition to the story of how humans can adapt in the most strenuous of circumstances and with no hope of any assistance.",10,2,3,6 November 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The robots should have been a bit more human
","The first time I watched this movie I was unimpressed, considering the action overwhelming to the relationships. There is no question that the first chase scene goes on far too long and seems to have the sole purpose of simply smashing up cars, buildings and other collateral objects. What made the second movie so good was the dialog and the expanding relationship between the Schwarzenegger terminator and the young John Connor. It reached the point where the good terminator begins to take on some human characteristics and is considered a father figure.
The evil terminator in this movie is powerful, far more than even the one in the second movie. The Schwarzenegger terminator is obsolete and in this movie is also almost exclusively robotic, showing no human-like intonation or facial expression. The evil terminator is also female, yet it also never expresses anything resembling emotions of any kind. The evil male terminator in the second movie occasionally had human-like facial expressions and did not always speak in monotone.
There are some amusing sight gags, specifically regarding the vehicles and when Schwarzenegger rescues John Connor by carrying him in a coffin. Yet, it ends with the very depressing idea that the thermonuclear war known as judgement day was inevitable, something that contradicts the ending of the second movie. It is natural to want the human race to win, not face extinction at the hands of its own electronic creations.",8,0,0,17 May 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Super friends battle over principle
","When superheroes battle their evil counterparts, there is almost always major collateral damage. It is a rare occasion when they meet in a remote area such as the Sahara Desert. These battles also often include the deaths or serious injury of innocent bystanders. Concerned about this, governments around the world have banded together under the United Nations banner to write a series of regulations governing the superhero group the Avengers.
Captain America (Steve Rogers) is opposed to signing the new law while Iron Man (Tony Stark) is strongly in favor. This creates a major rift in the Avengers with the others being forced to take sides. At first the conflict is verbal only, but there is an incident where it breaks out into open conflict. Hence the term 'Civil War.' It is superhero against superhero in a battel that shatters unity and leads to hostility and serious injury. Tony Stark is torn when he visits the penal facility where some of the Avengers are being held under special and very restrictive controls.
The action is intense with a great deal of hand-to-hand fighting. It would seem unlikely that Captain American would stand a chance against the armored Iron Man, but he holds his own. Punches and other items are thrown, bodies fly and there is some literal blood drawn. The dialog is also very good, while there are a few instances where a cliché is dropped, they are very rare.
Two high points of the dialog were very amusing. When Tony Stark is trying to convince Peter Parker (Spider-Man) to leave town and aid him in his task of rounding up the renegade Avengers his response is, 'I can't, I have homework.' The second is the cameo by legend Stan Lee. He plays a deliveryman with a package for 'Tony Snark.'",10,2,4,29 April 2020
X-Men: The Last Stand," A mutant child is the prize
","The premise of this final episode of the X-Men featuring Charles Xavier, Scott Sommers and Jean Grey is that a pharmaceutical company has developed a vaccine that will 'cure' mutants of their powers. For a few of them, it is a godsend, but for the vast majority, it is a cure for what should not be considered a disease.
As is usually the case, Magneto takes the side of opposition and he attracts many mutants to his side. He considers it a war against Homo Sapiens and the X-Men and Xavier stand in opposition. Compounding everything is the return of Jean Grey, now more the Phoenix than the Marvel Girl. There are some initial skirmishes, but it comes down to a titanic battle between the forces of Magneto against a unit of U. S. soldiers and a few of the X-Men.
The special effects are of course tremendous, for without them no modern superhero movie could be even close to entertaining. There are some casualties, but the ending hints that we may have not seen the last of Magneto. It is a visually stimulating movie, but if you are unfamiliar with the X-Men history to this point, there are many references that you will not understand.",10,3,3,8 February 2019
Patton," Scott was made for the role of Patton
","This is one of the best war movies of all time, about one of the best generals the United States ever produced. George Patton was a man that truly loved war and excelled at it and little else. He is the kind of man that nations need in time of war and then would rather toss aside when it is a time of peace.
George C. Scott excels in his role as George Patton, it is easy to see why he won an Academy Award for best actor. The movie is also a fairly accurate rendition of the career of Patton during the Second World War. He was foul-mouthed, hard-driving and prone to making very inappropriate statements about friend and foe alike.
Patton's rivalry with General Bernard Montgomery is also described in this movie. Even though the Americans and British were very close allies in the war, men of colossal ego will always clash, even when it is a matter of life and death.
The opening of this movie, where Patton is giving a speech to his troops, is arguably the best opening of a movie ever filmed. This may also be the best war movie ever made, even though it is not really about war. It is about a man that loved war and would have hated the peace had he lived more than six months after the end of the war in Europe.
If there was ever a role that made an actor and that he was destined to fill, it is George C. Scott as General Patton.",10,0,0,27 November 2019
The Piano," Love for music expressed non-verbally
","This is one of the most original and unusual love stories ever put on film. Holly Hunter is Ada McGrath, a woman of English origin that travels with her daughter to New Zealand in an arranged marriage to a man also of English extraction. Ada is a mute and has a love for playing the piano, one is a component of the personal belongings she brings.
Sam Neill plays Alisdair Stewart, the husband of the marriage and a man with no time for music, all he wants is a wife obedient to his wishes. Alisdair simply leaves the piano on the beach, an act that devastates Ada. Harvey Keitel plays George Baines, a native Maori that warms to Ada and her love for music. He has the piano transported to his residence, giving him the opportunity to be alone with Ada.
At first, Ada resists George's advances, but her love of the piano overwhelms all of her qualms and she becomes sexually intimate with George. This sets up a love triangle where Alisdair acts out the most brutal of what a husband could legally do to his wife. All of the players give superb performances, especially Hunter and Anna Paquin that plays daughter Flora McGrath. Ada's intense love for playing the piano comes through very clear through facial expressions and body language.
The viewer quickly finds themselves empathizing with Ada and antagonistic to Alisdair. There is the hope that somehow Ada and George will become a couple and the movie will end with Ada blissfully playing the piano. Not quite the ending. George's fellow Maori provide a solid supporting role by providing people of Maori culture rather than more transported people of English extraction. This is a great movie, worthy of every award it received.",10,0,1,25 December 2019
Black Hawk Down," This movie is a history lesson contained within a war movie.
","While this is a tense and realistic war movie with a great deal of action and suspense, it also demonstrates that military valor is of little value when there is political ignorance and arrogance. The backdrop is the U. S. military operation in Somalia in the early nineties. The government of Somalia had collapsed, and the country degenerated into zones controlled by various warlords and civil war. They all used intimidation and starvation to tighten their hold on power and the U. S. led an operation to try to end the civil war and stop the mass starvation.
It was a mission that began with the best of intentions yet was based on a lack of understanding of the situation in the country. In many ways, it was based on the misbegotten belief that the Somali people would be grateful, and the Americans and UN personnel would be hailed as benevolent heroes. When there was some pushback, the U. S. command came up with a foolish and arrogant plan to kidnap General Aideed in the capital city of Mogadishu.
This movie is a well-done depiction of that raid, from the initial arrogance of the American troops to the disaster that followed, where the American soldiers demonstrated incredible valor and sacrifice. The Americans believed that it would be so quick and easy that some didn't even bother to don their body armor or fill their canteens. Furthermore, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin turned down the request of the U. S. military for armored vehicles including tanks, fact not well explained.
As battles go, it was a victory for the American forces, 18 American soldiers were killed while over 1,000 Somalis died in the fight. Yet, it was a defeat, demonstrating that even people starving in a civil war will take up arms against an invasion force and leading to the American withdrawal. This movie is a history lesson contained within a war movie.",10,4,5,19 January 2019
Blood Diamond," Accurate enough to be used in history classes
","Brutal conflicts over natural resources have been a fundamental component of African life for several generations. Fueled by the western need for resources, most of the combatants have been Africans that have claimed the same national allegiance. The companies and governments of the western nations understand how the battles are being carried out and the level of human carnage, but generally are only interested in maintaining the production.
The setting is the African nation of Sierra Leone in 1999, when there was an outbreak of a brutal civil war. Men and boys are forcibly recruited by rebel groups to work in the diamond mines and any attempt to steal a diamond leads to execution. The armed groups regularly enter villages suspected of allegiance to the other side and shoot down innocents, rape the women and will cut off the limbs of children in order to make a point.
Leonardo di Caprio plays Danny Archer, a Rhodesian veteran of the wars in Southern Africa and now a diamond smuggler. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman in a village of Sierra Leone when the civil war breaks out in earnest. A rebel group attacks his village and while his wife and youngest children manage to escape, Vandy is captured and forced to work in the diamond mines. He discovers a monstrous stone and when he is about to be forced to turn it over to his overlord, government troops attack and Solomon manages to bury the stone before being captured.
Archer has been arrested while attempting to smuggle diamonds across the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia and ends up in the same prison as Vandy. This is the spark of an unlikely alliance between the two men. Archer is a man that is at times as ruthless as the people he is fighting, yet he does retain a spark of humanity. The remainder of the story has the two men on a hunt to recover the diamond by any means necessary.
The violence in the movie is significant, but it does genuinely reflect what was going on in Africa at the time. Entire villages were being wiped out, children were being impressed into armed groups to serve as ruthless soldiers and the diamond companies mostly stood back unless they considered it necessary to send in their mercenary units. The best aspect of the movie is that it genuinely reflects what took place in Africa.
One of the best lines in the movie references the historical fact that the Belgian controllers of the Congo implemented a policy of cutting off the hands of workers in order to keep them terrified and working. Given that a bounty for scalps has been a part of law of the European based governments in the United States for centuries, the point is that the acts of barbarism towards enemies has a lot of European origins.
This is a movie that entertains and educates and should be viewed in classes that cover the colonization and how corporations operate in countries unable to resist them.",10,0,0,16 December 2019
The Last Samurai," Brutal clash of internal cultures within Japan
","This is a great war movie, the action is fierce, unforgiving and intense. Even though the viewer knows what the outcome of the climactic battle will be, the goal of the 'good side' is not to win, but to lose gloriously.
As the title suggests, the backdrop is Japan in a time of great transition. Although Japan was closed to foreigners for 200 years, there was enough leakage so that the rulers of Japan were well aware of what the British and other western powers were doing in China, essentially subjugating it. They also knew that they had no weapons that could stand against those of the colonial powers.
Therefore, when the American Commodore Perry sailed into Edo Bay in 1853 and carried out a show of arrogance and force, the Japanese government had no choice but to accede. This led to a national crisis in Japan, where the rulers knew that they had two choices, modernize the country or be subjugated like China was.
The internal conflicts within Japan in the rush to modernize forms the background for this movie. For centuries, the warrior class of Japan were the samurai, skilled soldiers that fought using only hand weapons, most commonly swords, bows and spears. They resisted the modernization efforts, so the government formed a modern army with firearms and cannons to defeat them.
Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a highly decorated soldier that is now in a love affair with the bottle. Algren is recruited to train the fledgling Japanese Army, but after the initial skirmish, he is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. During his lengthy captivity, Algren learns to appreciate the discipline and beliefs of the samurai, taking their side in the hopeless fight against the modern Japanese Army.
The performances of Cruise and Watanabe are superb, the viewer becomes very empathetic towards the samurai, all while knowing that their cause is hopeless. While these exact events did not happen, there is enough historical truth to make it a history lesson. The mindset of the samurai also will help viewers understand the Japanese unwillingness to surrender in World War II. For they were only following the bushido code.",10,0,2,8 January 2019
Invincible," Excellent expression of a male fantasy
","On the surface, the Vince Papale story is one that all boys playing unorganized football fantasize about. Papale was working as a part-time bartender in his home town of South Philadelphia when he attended a tryout being held by the Philadelphia Eagles. He survived the tryout, attended training camp and was one of the last players retained on the roster. Papale became a hero to the people of Philadelphia, as he was living out what was for many the ultimate fantasy. Voted captain of the special teams, he played in the NFL for three years before an injury forced him to retire.
The movie is exciting and uplifting, as all embodiments of fantasies should be. While it is based on a true story, there are some serious actions of poetic license taken. For example, in the movie there is the dramatic touchdown where Papale tackles the punt returner forcing a fumble and then recovers it, carrying it into the end zone for a touchdown. In fact, Papale never scored a touchdown in the NFL, although he did force a fumble on a punt return. He is also portrayed as a football novice when he attended the Eagles tryout when he had played for two years on the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League. Therefore, he was not a complete unknown to the Eagle coaching staff. In the movie, Papale attends an open tryout where every nut with a football fantasy attended. In fact, his tryout was a private one to which he was invited.
While there is a lot of imagination put into the story, it is still one that uplifts you, for there are people that live or die in the virtual sense based on how well their home team performs. There is a lot of hometown pride inherent in people that are seeing the job market in their neighborhood collapsing due to changing economic conditions. Those aspects of the movie are very real.",10,1,2,25 January 2019
Thor," Entertaining, but lacks the style of dialog of the comic
","While the special effects representing the abode of the Norse gods known as Asgard and the Bifrost bridge are extremely impressive, the storyline is less so. At the start of the story, Thor is depicted as an impulsive, emotional god that must be reigned in by the reigning god, the wise Odin. Thor's behavior is so out of line that Odin banishes him to New Mexico with no godlike powers and without the ability to control his mighty hammer known as Mjolnir,. Although he is still tough as nails and capable of physically defeating nearly all human males, he can still be whipped up on.
When a small team of astronomical researchers encounter the deposed Thor when he is hit by their van, a relationship between them is begun. Thor's mighty hammer also lands near where Thor did, and it defies all attempts by humans to move it. There is a great cameo by Stan Lee in that sequence of actions. A massive team of U. S. government agents (S. H. I. E. L. D.) swarms in and begins the study of the hammer, yet despite the highest of technologies at their disposal, they learn very little about it.
Meanwhile, Thor's brother Loki learns that while Thor is Odin's true offspring, he was in fact adopted by Odin. This leads to a great deal of resentment and Loki engaging in a great deal of underhanded machinations in trying to ascend to the Asgardian throne. Since Thor rekindled the hostilities between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants and they are plotting to recover the source of their power from Asgard, Thor's absence gives the Frost Giants an advantage. Since he is the spawn of the Frost Giants and the Asgardian throne is at stake, Loki does not hesitate to align himself with the leader of the Frost Giants.
The weakness of the movie is that the events on Earth sometimes come across as forced and uncertain. The S. H. I. E. L. D. agents are arrogant, ignoring the laws regarding search and seizure and some of the action scenes are played with needless destruction by the killer robot known as Destroyer. It is a fun movie, but the dialog does not have the charming Shakespearean quality of the comic book character.",8,0,0,16 January 2020
The Happening," An implausible but perhaps not impossible scenario
","This apocalyptic tale holds your attention and is based on an extreme extrapolation of what happens in nature. As people that follow medicine are well aware, most of the drugs, both good and bad, have their natural origin in plants. Specifically psychoactive drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and opium. It is also known that plants produce and release a variety of chemicals in response to environmental dangers.
The premise of this movie is that the plants in the United States are being subjected to a stressful environment due to human actions, so they respond by releasing a psychoactive chemical. When humans encounter the chemical, they experience an overwhelming compulsion to immediately kill themselves. Some of the suicides are horrific in nature, such as allowing themselves to be eaten by zoo lions.
The 'attack' takes place in the New England states of the United States and the movie follows the adventures of Elliot Moore, his wife and the daughter of one of Elliot's friends as they flee the terror that is stalking them. Moore is a high school science teacher and he quickly learns that the attacks are triggered be specific circumstances.
The movie is at times very gross and explicit as people find very gory ways to kill themselves. There are moments that tensed me up and I am generally immune to screen fear. Human nature being what it is, you see the best and worst of what humans will do when in the grip of fear. There is also denial and the inevitable claim of government malfeasance before the movie ends on a pessimistic note.",9,3,4,11 February 2019
The Reader," Love and revulsion are simultaneous emotions
","This movie begins as if it is solely a romantic tale of somewhat forbidden love, but it is much more than that. Kate Winslet stars as Hanna Schmitz, a conductor on the city tram lines. David Kross is the teenaged Michael Berg and the original location in Berlin, Germany in 1958. Michael becomes sick while walking the streets and vomits at the entrance to an apartment building. Hanna takes pity on him, cleans him up and helps him go home.
Michael is diagnosed with scarlet fever, a very dangerous illness at the time and it takes months for him to recover. Once he is well, he revisits Hanna's apartment with flowers in hand. One thing leads to another and they become lovers, older woman and teenage boy. The affair continues and quickly includes Michael reading to Hanna on a regular basis. He learns that Hanna is illiterate, unable to read or write even the simplest words. There are then flash forwards to an adult Michael where he recollects events in his past and tries to cope with his present. These flash forwards continue for some time.
Young Michael enters law school and in an advanced seminar they attend the trial of some female Nazi prison camp guards. Hanna is one of the defendants, which strains Michael psychologically. Hanna is found guilty and given a life sentence. Michael is torn, because he knows that Hanna is illiterate and could not have done some of what she was accused of.
When Hanna is in prison, Michael sends her a tape recorder and cassettes containing books he has put on tapes. Hanna treasures the material and it motivates her to learn to read and write. There is a dramatic conclusion to their relationship and an anticlimax. It is clear from the way it is played that Hanna is the love of Michael's life, yet he cannot get past her sordid past. He struggles with his complex feelings for her, from love to revulsion at what she once was.
This is a movie about love between a teen boy and adult woman that lasts, but in a very complex form.

Michael struggles to make sense of his feelings, what Hanna did and at the end he does the right thing, but not to the results he envisioned.",10,0,0,17 April 2020
Fifty Shades of Grey," A Cinderella tale that has kinky twists
","While this is a remake of the Cinderella plot, it has some literal and figurative kinky twists. Christian Grey is a very wealthy and attractive young man that trolls the world for women that will satisfy his desires. Anastasia (Anna) Steele is a college student given the task of interviewing the reclusive Grey, something that few have done. Grey is so secretive that the public does not know whether he is gay or straight.
There is a bit of a spark during the interview and they begin a relationship based on a contract written by Grey where Anna is designated as the submissive. For Grey has a difficult time with relationships with women and he is most comfortable when there is an underlying current of S & M with him in charge.
Yet, there is a spark of feeling between them that complicates his world and at first simplifies hers. With his vast wealth, Grey can provide experiences and buy things that Anna could only dream about before. Their relationship remains one of active sex, yet with an undercurrent of tension that can potentially destroy what they have together. It has the potential to burst into a happy ending where they fall into each other's arms in the implied happy ever after final scene.
The movie has some very powerful emotional moments, yet most are unpleasant for one or both of them. At times you feel for Grey and other times you hope that he bangs a knee against a table leg. It is a complex story that in many ways is a more realistic depiction of the Cinderella fantasy.",8,1,2,19 March 2020
Beowulf," An epic old English poem reasonably expressed as a movie
","Beowulf is an ancient English epic poem of over 3,000 lines that is known as having been first written down sometime between 975 and 1025 CE. It is set in Scandinavia, a land of bitter cold, mountains, moors and mysteries. Beowulf is a traditional hero, coming to the aid of a king and kingdom besieged by a hideous monster, defeating it in battle and then being hailed as a hero.
When the original story opens, the mead hall of Hrothgar, King of the Danes, is attacked by the monster Grendel. Beowulf vows to kill the monster, which he does. Enraged by the death of her son, Grendel's mother seeks revenge, and in a second titanic battle, Beowulf succeeds in killing her as well.
Beowulf then returns to his own kingdom and assumes the position of king. Fifty years later, a dragon becomes enraged when a gold cup is stolen from its' lair. It emerges and begins burning everything it encounters. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon and Beowulf insists that he carry on the battle alone. Outmatched, Beowulf is losing the fight until his warrior friend Wiglaf disobeys orders and assists Beowulf. The dragon is killed, but Beowulf is mortally wounded, and the story ends with his funeral pyre burning.
The producers take some significant poetic license with the original story, specifically in the rendition of the battle between Beowulf and Grendel's mother and Beowulf's ascension to the throne. Yet, this is another demonstration of how the old epic poems of heroism can be made into quality modern movies.
It is unfortunate that Beowulf is not given more attention in K-12 English classes, for it is the northern European equivalent to the Iliad of Homer. With this movie as an educational aid, it will be much easier to generate interest among the students in this key element of Western Civilization.",10,1,2,30 January 2019
