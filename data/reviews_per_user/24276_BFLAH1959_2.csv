Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Worst of the Prequels
","Out of these movies, this movie is the worst. The film contains content to a more G-rated sci-fi film. Holy, Chicken Little. This movie is not the best and it is the worst. I could match the disappointment of this film with Return of the Jedi. I wish this film was better off without Anakin as an 9-year old boy. The only part that was good during the film was the light saber duel. A 'Star Wars' fan like myself would be very appreciative to find out that this sequence is lightning fast. These duels reach above and beyond the stars. The duels are hostile and awesome to a certain extent. The prequel movies have the best duels and of course these duels are better than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi. I wished the story and actors had a better role in the entire prequel trilogy. The disappointment of the prequels were that it had no story, plot or characters we could relate to. It seemed as if the special effects told the story. I was very dismayed with this movie, I hope that the T.V. series does better than this trilogy.",7,1,2,25 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An Awesome Film in the Prequel Saga
","I loved this film out of all the prequels! I loved the end journey of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of the Empire. This movie basically bridges the way to 'A New Hope' and I am hoping for the T.V. series which shows what happens between the two trilogies. This movie is the bomb, above all levels! I love the original trilogy and I seem to be bored with the prequel trilogy. Basicallly, in all sense of the words, 'Phantom Menace' was absolutely horrible. 'Attack of the Clones' was hilarious to the fact of the screwed up love attraction between a Senator that seems to never change in age, height, and weight, with a twenty-year old at 6 foot, 1 inch. A disappointment with the action in 'Attack' nevertheless a mere stupid plot with only special effects to tell the story. I believe that the special effects were the last hope for Lucas's film. But this film ruled with such distinction and the first time ever, a plot. This story contains character's you could relate to in every sense of the word. The tragedy of the fall of Anakin Skywalker creates a tear-jerking experience only some witnessed. This film is the first film 9Of the Prequels) I've seen in theaters. I was in a theater with a huge screen with stadium seating, by the way it included surround sound stereo, which is so loud. This film was the best choice to see in theaters. In ranking of the entire saga: 1. Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope 2. Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back 3. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith 4. Star wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi 5. Star Wars Epsidoe I: The Phantom Menace 6. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the CLones",10,1,7,25 November 2005
