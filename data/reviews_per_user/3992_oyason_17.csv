The Blair Witch Project," A gothic's gothic
","Here at last is a film that can with all justification wear the mantle horror, in its richest sense.  Gone are the axe murderers and green vomit spitting demon possessed, gone are all the bug eyed monsters and even the more sympathetic ones. At the same time, we recognize in Heather's character Victor Frankenstien's obsession, i.e., the hubris that leads us all into the woods when we're not absolutely sure where we're going.  That's the dilemma of the human experience, and that's why Blair Witch works for so many of us, I think.  We all make Heather's error a hundred times or more in our lives, and we drag people along who either don't know how to fend for themselves or actually can't.  And that's when the heartache begins, as the old song goes, because the way out isn't clearly marked.  And while the woods may not be as filled with tigers as they seem and the world may not hate us, the tigers are still chewing bones, and the world does not exactly love us, either. As for the controversial camera work, it's pretty clever to create a plot wherein whatever the camera does is basically going to be correct.  These are student film makers, right?  At the same time, to those who believe the actual film makers got sloppy, please check out the more recent editions of the film with the outtakes, a couple of which are genuinely wretched. No, a lot of serious thought beyond just marketing went into this piece. My favorite scene in the film is when Heather, exasperated, insists that people don't get lost in America.  Right behind this, Michael and Josh begin singing 'the Star Spangled Banner' and 'America the Beautiful'.  Whether it was intended or not, the film makers comment that people do get lost in America, and they don't have to be in the woods either.All in all, the film is a fine piece of psychological horror and a decent outing for the actual film makers, Sanchez and Myrick.  Clearly there's always room for improvment, but I don't know if it's in any of the areas ('Genuinely scary films like the Exorcist or the Shining') some people are suggesting.  I'm of the opinion that this one stands up all by itself, in a way that most films people call 'scary' seldom can.  It displays a little confidence in the imagination, not only in the imagination  of the audience, but in the imagination of its cast. That's a rare achievement in these days when most American film makers use special effects as a crutch.  I think the Blair Witch Project is one of those films that lends the horror genre some much needed credibility, and all kudoes go to Sanchez and Myrick.",Null,0,1,22 January 2003
Vertigo," Midge is going to be bringing Scotty crayons for a long time
","Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO is one of the greatest suspense films ever made. The director was at the top of his form with this work, which highlights intimate obsession bordering on necrophilia, which is a theme unusual in the time and place this movie was produced ( a U.S. studio in the late 1950s),but also Hitchock's amazingly ghoulish humor.Scotty Fergusen (Jimmy Stewart) is a private investigator who is recently retired from the city police force over an incident on the job that resulted in the death of a colleague and a pronounced fear of heights in Fergusen. Scotty is financially independent and has some support in the friendship of his confidant and former fiancé' Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes). His life and what's left of his emotional stability begin to be challenged when he is contracted by wealthy shipping magnate Gavin Elster (Tom Elmore) to track the doings of his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who has developed an obsession with the history of a tragic ancestor that now borders on the fantastic and suicidal. Or so Scotty is led to believe. What follows from the investigation is a star-crossed romance which assumes a surreal and sometimes folkloric dimension from the get-go, and which culminates in a post-mortem fantasy that will immolate not only Scotty, but the fortunes of working girl Judy Barton (Kim Novak in an interesting role within a role).If you've not seen this film, I will only tell you that Hitchcock demonstrates the truth of his masterful reputation as a movie maker through a precipitous wrap-up that left me crying I was laughing so hard, but I'm pretty twisted. All I'm going tell you is that I can't believe he got away with that back in 1958, and that in whatever realm the creatures of imagination reside, Midge is going to be bringing Scotty crayons to play with for a long time.By far and away, this one easily rates for me as one of the best films overall ever made, and if you like classic suspense film from the greats, this is one you can't miss. Here is one more good example of why special effects by themselves do not a solid motion picture make, which is a sad reality lost on all too many filmmakers and their audiences these days.",10,5,6,10 August 2008
The Babadook," It's quieter today.
","THE BABADOOK isn't for everyone, but it's a special film, one that in its own quiet way seeks to address certain realities via tropes of the horror film. Jennifer Kent is an ambitious director who tips her hat to some of the greats in the genre, Mamoulian, Melies, Bava, Whale, Kubrick. THE BABADOOK is a bold foray into psychological horror, repressed intimacy of women,single parenting, social isolation, child abuse, in a neat little package that she probably managed to crank out for under a million dollars. The movie lags in one moment where the script falls into the trap of explaining something the viewer has had time to figure out. But that doesn't drive the momentum of the piece, which leaves the viewer lots of room to draw their own conclusions as to which reality the characters actually are functioning within. The close of the story is open ended, but not in the over-used 'something's gonna go on jumping out the bushes and getting you' standard that has been beaten to death in the ghost story/horror film this last ten years. Again, I think this is a special movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing what Jennifer Kent does next. She is a breath of fresh air compared to many of the so-called film makers who dominate the western film industry, and particularly the horror film. THE BABADOOK is a rare treat, filled with fine pointed grace and craft.",10,1,6,6 May 2015
Orphan," Very.
","It took me three years to finally spend some time with ORPHAN, which at least on the surface looked like another demon child/Bad Seed knockoff. I stumbled across it in the library a week ago, bit, and was more than pleasantly surprised. ORPHAN rates as one of the better offerings I've seen in the thriller/horror genre in quite some time, and it has a wicked little twist that keeps its viewer guessing. It's a bit of a slow starter, but give this one time. It has a very fine cast, Vera Farmiga holds the lead down beautifully as the recovering alcoholic Kate and Peter Saarsgaard is also very good as her husband John, who fills the boyfriend/husband without a clue (tradition in classic horror) quite ably. Best of all is Isabelle Fuhrman as the monstrous Esther. This is a very fine piece of work and I don't want to give anything away. Trust me when I say this is very satisfying time spent.",9,0,0,25 February 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," A forthright exploration of what an adult world at war looks like to children
","Director Guillermo Del Toro's film PAN'S LABYRINTH is one of the most thoughtful fantasy/horror pictures that has been brought to mass (or mainstream audiences) in many years. The work is a sort of cross between THE NEVER ENDING STORY and Gunther Grass' Hitlerite Germany storyline THE TIN DRUM. Though there is little to find here in the way of original storyline or exploration of fantastic themes, it is a forthright exploration of what an adult world at war looks like to children, and deserves the continued attention of those film lovers who have a special hankering for the Gothic genre.The work is set against the background of Franco's Spain, which is in the process of consolidating a fascist victory over the Republican government that was defeated in 1939. The year is 1944, and Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a precocious 12 year old girl with a passion for fantasy literature, is the step-daughter of a military specialist, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who has married her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil). Ofelia is isolated, and has an ally in the head of the housekeeping staff in Vidal's compound, a woman named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu).Captain Vidal has been sent to the countryside in Spain in order to shut down the partisan resistance which is still waging guerrilla warfare in the mountains, and the arrival of his adapted family is the note the film begins on. Ofelia's mother Carmen is experiencing a difficult pregnancy with Vidal's child, and looks to her daughter for the little stability and support she is able to attain living in a military compound. Ofelia's main comfort is in the world of dreams and nightmare she is able to create for herself, an activity that is frowned upon by her mother and condemned by her rigid-spit-and polish step father. She also some support from Mercedes, who is a sort of socialist 'fellow traveler' and supporter of the guerrilla resistance hidden inside the Captain's household. Ofelia's world of personal folklore leads her into a fantasy relationship with a mystical faun (Doug Jones) who, in her thinking, patterns for her a quest and boon she must endure in order to reclaim her status as a princess in the realm of the fantastic, and thereby save her mother and unborn brother. And it is her life, both within the bounds of imagination and the strictures of the real world, that makes up the bulk of this story, which can only end in madness and death.I don't think I've said too much here, but having noted all this, it should also be observed that, despite the graphic quality of the violence in this film, PAN'S LABYRINTH remains an interesting and compelling chunk of film. The overall message of the work is sweet in its essence, and lacks the world-weariness of much of the junk that passes for mainstream entertainment in these here United States. If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely a 'ringer' for the fantasy film audience.",Null,2,5,30 June 2007
Malcolm X," larger than life but so Malcolm was
","It was almost inevitable that any work that attempted to tell the story of a personality as large as that of Malcolm X would fall into larger-than-life schematics and all too many Steven Spielburg skies. So it is particularly fitting that the first major film work done on the life of Malcolm, Spike Lee's MALCOLM X, was generated by one of U.S. film making's most controversial talents. MALCOLM X was released at a time when all too many Black Americans were hungry for work about African American icons that stepped outside of the Budweiser Corporation type representation of Black experience seen on tavern walls, so it shouldn't surprise that the first Black film maker to take on so ambitious a project sometimes fell into spectaclist technique. People need legends and heroes, and Malcolm is certainly a heroic figure.Malcolm's story has become increasingly familiar to people outside the Black community. A man with a strong sense of self-identification from his youth, he moved through several identity changes, from shoeshine hustler to railroad porter to borderline gangster to convict to minister and organizer of the Nation of Islam, to the dynamic articulator of African American struggle that he was in his final push for the Organization of African American Unity. His life was the flip side of what is called the American Dream, and when he was murdered at the age of 39 in 1965, he was well on his way to becoming the leader of a revolutionary democratic insurgence in the United States. In short, his life was the stuff of legend.So along comes Spike Lee, and assembles this remarkable cast in telling the story of his life: Denzel Washington as Malcolm, Angela Basset as Dr. Betty Shabazz, Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Mohammed, Delroy Lindo as Malcolm's street 'mentor' West Indian Archie, Albert Hall as his prison associate, Brother Baines, and Giancarlo Esposito as one of Malcolm's assassins, Thomas Hayer. There are numerous cameos from Hollywood glitterati, and even unlikely personalities such as the late and notorious radical attorney William Kuntsler appears in this film as the judge who sentences Malcolm to his prison term. There are also a number of clever black and white footages that, when shot, bore so close a resemblance to the newsreels some of us grew up with, they become difficult to tell from the originals. Denzel comes that close to the real man's carriage and timbre.I do regret that Spike Lee did not feel the need to acknowledge the contributions made to his screenplay posthumously by James Baldwin. It seems to me several portions of this film are loosely lifted from Baldwin's stillborn film biography of Malcolm, ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOST. But I suppose that's an issue for the legatees of Baldwin's estate to work out with Lee.The bottom line is that this was a timely film (1992), Disney-like crescendos and all. The movie was released in the wake of the Los Angeles Riots that followed the verdict on the LAPD beating of Rodney King. The work gave younger and older Black people an event to talk about and do some mutually respectful sharing of ideas about cultural integrity and critique, and if that's all Spike Lee accomplished with MALCOLM X, that's good enough for me.",Null,3,8,3 April 2006
Watchmen," Possibly the worst super hero film ever made
","'The Watchmen' is a cover of Alan Moore's graphic novel from the 1980s. The story is set against an alternative time line in the United States where Richard Nixon is perennially re-elected, the United States wins the war in Vietnam, and the presence of super-heroes generates public controversy. The characters of the now long-forgotten Charlton Comics universe like the Blue Beetle (Night Owl) and the Question (Rorshach) among many others, are given new names and some extended play in Alan Moore's story. The Watchmen's world is threatened by the nuclear terrors of the Cold War, and the main defense the United States has left is in the hands of super gladiators like the psychotic soldier of fortune, the Comedian, and the formerly human but now wholly reconstituted Dr. Manhattan, whose self-recreation through Hydrogen fusion makes him near God-like in essence. The streets of New York are guarded by a skeezy street executioner named Rorshach, who defies federal injunctions against vigilantes, and who is one of the more engaging characters in the story. The premise of the novel is pretty silly, and Alan Moore himself calls the work one of his early efforts to write the 'last super hero story'.Zach Snyder is an ambitious young man, but ambition of the sort that makes movies out of graphic novels like 'Watchmen' isn't necessarily the same as genius, which is about what it would take to put something as convoluted as 'Watchmen' on the screen. The sub-narrative of the piece, the comic book within the comic book 'Tales from the Black Freighter' is essential to 'Watchmen', and without it, the storyline loses much of its satirical edge. Worse yet, Snyder lacks all sense of the actual history and the bankruptcy of most mass culture that Moore satirizes so effectively in so much of his work. Nowhere is this clearer than in the ridiculous montage of establishing shots which Snyder created at the beginning of the film which are backed by an extended version of Bob Dylan's 'The Times, they are a'changin''. As a film maker, Snyder seems obsessed and mystified by the violent excess in U.S. history, which is always a sign of someone who essentially has nothing new to say. Snyder attempts to make up for this shortcoming in his understanding by graphically depicting scenes of violence which are only alluded to in the storyline of Moore's novel itself. And it doesn't help, because, as Malcolm X once said, you can put kittens in the oven but that isn't going to turn them into biscuits. Hence, what we've got here is three and a half hours of mediocre acting, people most of whom I'm sure are quite gifted in other settings leaping around in spandex costumes and delivering dialogue in a manner that makes the late Jack Webb look like Kenneth Branagh. Hell, as little as half an hour of this sort of thing can be exhausting, but it's funny if you know how, and William Dozier and Adam West proved that pretty conclusively 40 years ago with their farce 'Batman'. Unfortunately, the oh-so-serious Mr. Snyder chose to play it ultra-straight, and in that way lies disaster. Some comic books are better off staying comic books. In the words of Carlos Castaneda's fictional Yaqui Brujo Don Juan, why should a crow be anything but a crow?",2,9,14,4 August 2009
The Shining," Kubrick delivers one way or another.
","Rare is the film that is better then its inspiration in literature, but THE SHINING (Stanley Kubrick, 1980) must be among the handful that meet that criteria. Director Stanley Kubrick takes a lot of liberties with Stephen King's storyline, but the end result resonates more powerfully then the author's novel.Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are Jack and Wendy Torrance, who have agreed to care take a spectacular hotel in the mountains of Colorado over the course of the winter. They are accompanied by their son Danny, here portrayed by talented child actor Danny Lloyd. Danny was born with a caul on his face, which, according to folklore makes him a recipient of psychic gifts that a family acquaintance, the hotel cook Dick Holloran (Scatman Crothers) calls 'shining'.The problem is that the Hotel Overlook is a vast barn of a hotel, overflowing with the chimerical shadows of a long, violent history. And young Danny and his powers become the object of the malevolent institution's want. Jack is slowly turned against his family, as was his predecessor, hotel caretaker Delbert Grady, who butchered his children with an axe and stacked their bodies like cord wood in the hotel's west wing. Grady is among the many spectral energies that still inhabit the Overlook, and the entire phantasmic location is one that can draw sustenance from Jack Torrance's past, one soaked in alcohol abuse and the fear of further destroying his life and career. Jack left behind him in Vermont a career as a ritzy private boy's school teacher, which he forfeited through the beating of a student during a drunken rage. He tinkers with an unfinished novel between dry drunk episodes.It's a potboiler storyline, in short. Robert Wise made something roughly similar work fifteen years before when he took Shirley Jackson's vastly superior book THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE and turned it into the classic THE HAUNTING. Stanley Kubrick's task was far more daunting, and he grasps King's excessive style and transforms it into a clever 'wrinkle in time' narrative. For those who are looking for loyalty to a novel's plot line, THE SHINING can only be a disappointment. But if you like Kubrick, and admire his versatility in expressing the brittleness and desolation of the modern day, this movie should work. The worst flaw of the work is the destruction of the one black character in the storyline, proving that even directors as advanced as Kubrick can fall into clichÃ©'.Recent releases of the film on both VHS and DVD have included a documentary on the making of the piece, which offers a warts and all take on what it was like for this particular cast to work together with some special focus on Jack Nicholson and his interestingly quirky contributions to style in performance. THE SHINING is good on a number of levels, and holds up well in the quarter century since its release. Watch for a certain elevator terror during the chase scene. It's a strikingly beautiful and powerful image that condenses the theme of the original work in a few hundred frames.",Null,0,1,11 March 2006
Duck Soup," It kept me alive during one of the worst years of my life
","DUCK SOUP was a Marxian film that came together at Paramount before the brothers went to MGM and got sanitized by Irving Thalberg and the Hays Office. I believe it is one of the very best the boys had to offer, although Groucho always maintained the more mainstream work done at MGM was better. But what stands out in DUCK SOUP- as in the other Paramount films the Brothers did- is the rootsy, East 93rd street Jewish kid effrontery that governed everything the guys did in vaudeville and on Broadway. Here, in this marvelous anti-war farce, you'll see Harpo at the top of his form in the sight gag, with ongoing battles with Edgar ('Slow Burn') Kennedy. Margaret Dumont, Raquel Torres and Louis Calhern are on board playing the straight man in the midst of the Marxian chaos. And there's no beating the mini-musical that introduces the final war sequence towards the end of the film. On a more personal level, this work kept me alive during one of the worst years of my life, and it still buoys me up in some pretty stark moments. Maybe it can do the same for you.",Null,2,4,5 March 2006
The Exorcist," Unrelenting
","THE EXORCIST is one riveting horror film for reasons most people who know the film don't talk about. This William Friedkin movie, based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, is not only about the terrors of demon possession- the idea of which is unsettling enough in itself. THE EXORCIST is also about the sterility of the contemporary world, and that is terrifying indeed.Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn), the lead character in the story, is a successful film actress who is working on a movie being shot on campus at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., a film which is the 'Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story', in her words. During the time of this production, McNeil's only daughter Regan (Linda Blair) is stricken with a mysterious ailment, which turns out to be possession by an ancient and violent energy from hell. After numerous medical tests and consultations regarding the 'attacks' her daughter is experiencing, the medical staff that she is taking her daughter to advise her to seek the assistance of an exorcist.McNeil consults a priest/psychiatrist whose brooding presence has caught her attention. Father Damien Karras(Jason Miller), a priest and student of psychology, is himself experiencing alienation and emotional trauma brought on by the recent death of his mother and his own growing lack of faith. Karras agrees to look into the McNeil case. Convinced by a number of disturbing phenomenon that the possession is for real, he makes arrangements for Regan to be exorcised by a father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow), a specialist in both theological and archaeological studies. Merrin travels from Iraq to perform the exorcism. He and Father Karras have a number of dramatic exchanges with the demon, the penultimate of which results in the death of the older priest. Karras then confronts the demon in a sort of street manner, defies it to leave Regan and enter him, and once it has done so, destroys both himself and the demon by hurling himself out a third story window. The negative forces in the earth are set back once again, and the curtain falls.But what the film leaves unresolved is the surrounding horror, the everyday horror that is much less then supernatural. All through this film, what is pronounced alongside the horrific things the demon does to Regan McNeil, is the essential coldness and lack of imagination to be found in the contemporary world, and this isolation and desolation is suggested in a number of scenes and camera techniques from the very beginning of the film. The opening frame, with the night time shot of the Georgetown brownstone the McNeils live in, is one that proclaims isolation even in the midst of prosperity. The camera jumps then to Baathist era Iraq in its semi-feudal misery, where the priest/archaeologist Father Merrin is overseeing a dig. Not only is the desolation of the near eastern landscape pronounced, but the isolation of Merrin as the western visitor and 'other' in a world that he is not part of on anything but a very abstract level.Back in Georgetown, where modern medical science at its apogee is offered to the McNeils, the very machinery of the modern reeks of sterility and the loneliness of infirmity and death. Nowhere is this theme more pronounced in the film then in the scenes where Karras, seeking to care for his dying mother, is forced to visit her in an underfunded and bureaucratic mental institution that serves the poor. When Father Karras' mother dies, she dies alone, and it is two days before she is discovered by the neighbors.Friedkin, to his credit, brings onto this hopeless scene some warmth and some light relief through his character Police Lieutenant Kinderman, here played by the very fine actor Lee J. Cobb. Kinderman lives a life of police department by-the-book, but he also has a life of mind and imagination that bolsters and prepares him for his everyday world. A film geek, he is fond of making semi- humorous allusions to his favorite movies in conversations with the protagonists in the movie. And it is entirely suitable that the movie ends on a note with him and a young associate of Father Karras, as opposed to the last, cold shot of the stairway next to the brownstone, as did the earlier released version of this movie.All in all, I think THE EXORCIST is far more about the horror of humanity at war with itself then it is about any supernatural visitations. I offer as parting validation for this assessment one of the last dialogs between Father Karras and Father Merrin. Karras asks why the demon has chosen a child to victimize, and Merrin replies that it is so people will despair, and feel themselves unworthy of the love of God. And it is this very self-imposed unworthiness that Friedkin focuses on for much of the film. At the end of the day, it is we whose imaginations have failed, who have no answers to our mutually agreed upon isolation. And that's the real terror. No demons need apply.",Null,0,1,22 December 2005
Revolutionary Road," Humid with a high chance of rain
","REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is a challenging work, in that it is based on a novel written by author Richard Yates back in the early 1960s. It is interesting that the film version appears now. The movie is intriguing and worthy, almost a poetic exposition of some of the sociological observations of the late C. Wright Mills, so it's not an easy cruise. But it's very good, a bold piece from director Sam Mendes.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are Frank and April Wheeler, an upper middle class Long Island couple whose marriage has gone sour as the dreams of a life in the arts or pursuit of life of mind have succumbed to the career realities of mortgage payments, children and upper class mobility. The setting is a relatively prosperous Long Island suburb during the 1950s.Frank Wheeler is a junior level executive for a business machine company, and spends many of his lunch hours drinking and commiserating with friends. The tension between he and April leads him to dalliances with secretaries, and the audience is witness to a manipulative trist he has with a 19 year old receptionist who falls under his 'charm'. April spends most of her days caught in the domestic trap that all too many women knew in the mid-1950s, housework and daydreaming about days gone by. At the beginning of the film, we see her performing in a community theater play that is poorly received by the audience, and she remains frustrated by the abandonment of her theater dreams.Bored and alienated by middle class suburbia and the quiet presumption imposed by neighbors caught in a similar bind, Frank and April decide they're going to sell the house and move their lives with their two children over to France. And, as fate would have it, this dream emerges at the exact same time that the company Frank works for decides that he's a bright new idea man, and offers him a big promotion. Frank is now caught between his undefined personal dreams and the possibilities of real material advancement. April, who knows desperately that she wants something much different then the life of a suburban housewife, but, who like most women of that era, rarely is allowed time or space to develop her ideas about who she is, clings wildly to the escape plan. Frank is a stormy individual caught in the casual lies most men from the professional classes in that era were bought into, and he frequently takes advantage of the enhanced isolation that is driving April nuts through engaging in abusive tirades.The film becomes deep tragedy over an unwanted pregnancy before its end, but along the way, some rather penetrating commentary on the Wheeler's situation by the son of a neighbor who has been struggling with mental illness lights up the Wheeler's reality better than either of the protagonists can, burdened as they are by the deceptions of careerism, extramarital dalliances, and parenting roles that neither of them really seem to want. The atmosphere of the piece, then, is like a high summer day on Long Island, humid with a high chance of rain. The viewer knows that some sort of cloudburst is going to come, and there's not much surprise when one of life's lethal downpours arrives and reshapes the lives of the central characters. All the same, Winslett and DiCaprio and their supporting cast carry this difficult piece quite ably. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is a keeper.",Null,0,0,29 January 2010

Psycho," It ain't for kids
","Psycho ain't for kids. Not because of the much celebrated shower scene, but because it asks something of its audience that a lot of children haven't developed yet.Hitchcock takes all the time in the world introducing us to the world of Marian Crane (Janet Leigh) before the bottom falls out of reality. And there's the real horror. This poor fool wallows into a trap of her own making, wanders into another set for her by the amazingly weird Norman Bates, played intently by Anthony Hopkins.After the prime horror of the story is completed, no one can do anything. Not the detective Arbogast, not the handsome but useless boyfriend, no one, because the prime horror was committed long before Marian Crane ever stepped into that shower, and it came out of the excesses of the nuclear family. But you're in Hitchcock land now, and what seems clear, beautiful and all-American is hiding a deep corruption steeped in fear of sex and death, and that is heavy indeed. A film like this reeks of a certain conscious angst, which is perhaps why the full color remake of a few years ago was so presumptuous. Psycho works because we have Robert Bloch and Alfred Hitchcock playing out some of the darkest realms of the subconscious in black and white. It is we, the audience, who add the color, in this dream that surrounds the dream. No color remake can ever hope to attain the same effect.In the meantime, this tight horror film stands, not only in its own time, but for the foreseeable future.",Null,0,1,12 August 2003
The Witch," American as apple pie
","THE WITCH is a haunting little opus in which film maker Robert Eggers reaches back into the folklore and living history of the United States to produce a story that's going to stick with you awhile. In this tale, a 17th century Puritan father breaks with his pilgrim forebears over Christian doctrine and leads his family out into an unforgiving section of wilderness which seemingly is also occupied by a blood cult of Wiccans. Things do not go well. That's all I'm going to tell you. 
But here there be mastery. No jump scares, no blood sloshed from here to creation, no zombies. Just good story telling, an outstanding cast, and some imagery that will have you up staring at the ceiling until two in the morning. That's what the good spook stories do. Best of all, THE WITCH is a bold reach into the grab bag of unique grand guignols that life in this section of the Americas is. It is American as apple pie.

Rosemary's Baby," In a word, outstanding.
","There are only a tiny handful of horrorfilms that really deserve the superlative outstanding, but Rosemary's Baby is definitely on my personal list and damn near the top of the column.Elements of the supernatural are present; the murderous coven, the devil come to earth, the use of juju to destroy the enemy. But all of these things are at nothing compared to the real horror in Rosemary's life: that she is nothing more then a gestation vessel for her ambitious husband, the gory eccentrics in her building, and the most powerful demon in the Christian pantheon. No one takes her seriously in any other capacity. Even at the end, her last bit of resistance is broken down as Roman Castavet eases her into the role of the 'mother of destruction'.I don't think it's any coincidence that Ira Levin wrote this novel or that it became such a huge hit in the sixties, when birth control pills became household words and the first open battles for legal abortion were being waged and won. The strength of this film is that it deals with social issues (reproductive rights) that were actively bouncing between the ears of the greater population of this country, and yet still doesn't become a tedious piece of social realism or agitprop. The cast of the film is remarkable. Mia Farrow plays a woman protagonist who is far more self identified then the usual female victim in a Gothic, Guy Cassevetes plays a treacherous husband whose actions are beneath contempt, both performances are very precise. The film bounces adroitly from the high camp of Elija Cook's fastidious building superintendent to the great white fatherliness seen in Maurice Evan's character Hutch. The use of Ruth Gordon is inspired, having Sidney Blackmer play straight man to her zaniness even more so. The very fine comedienne Patsy Kelly shows up as a more obstreporous member of the coven, Ralph Bellamy is sedate and subdued as the suave warlock Sapperstein. And somehow or other, director Roman Polanski managed to tie all these energies together and create a solid, consistent package with a subdued pace that is both hysterical and chilling at the same time. It is one powerful satire.Finally, the film contains one very strong nightmare sequence. Dreams are scary, Neil Gaiman reminds us,but there are few portrayed on film as strikingly as the one Rosemary has under a drug induced slumber on the night of her demonic group rape and the child's conception.Rosemary's Baby is a magnificent effort. And I believe it set a standard that every new horror film should be measured against, just as the film 2001 has become for many admirers of science fiction one of the benchmarks of that genre.",Null,61,80,19 February 2003
Downfall," The mass mania and despair of the moment portrayed
","DOWNFALL is an excellent film. There have probably been thousands of films that focus on the Second World War, but almost always the focus on Adolph Hitler is one of demonization of one personality, as opposed to examination of the sickness within mass politics that supported him to begin with. Aside from THE TIN DRUM, I can't think of any other work in recent years that so captures the group mania that hatched the Nazi juggernaut.But in DOWNFALL, we see the last days of the Third Reich as surely they must have been. We see first the frustrations of a medical bureaucrat (Dr. Schenck/Christian Berkel) who is trying to salvage what remains of civil structure in the midst of chaos, a man who is only in the late days of the war, along with his colleagues, realizing his own duplicity in the nuttiness that surrounds him. I'm not sure if this is a historically accurate depiction of Schenck, or if he is a fictional composite, but I believe it is right to put forward the idea that there were those few rare people even among the ranks of the Nazis who understood that if Germany had a chance to reshape itself, it would depend on such energies. Not far behind this are scenes in which we see Himmler (Ulrich Noetlen) discussing with a colleague how power will be divided once Hitler implodes. Heino Ferch is solid as Albert Speer, one of the survivors who is destined to tell the story of the Third Reich from the inside. Bruno Ganz portrayal of Hitler is one in which we see the charismatic descend into lunacy as the appointment with retribution draws near. Effective also in their portrayals are Corrinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Ulrich Matthes as the war propagandist Joseph Goebbels, and Julianne Kohler as Eva Braun. Each of these actors represent the despairing mania that prompted the fascist machine among the down and out professional classes to begin with. Their inability to move outside of the extravagance of upper middle class culture is portrayed here in tight style and good form. But most telling of all are the flashback scenes related by the central character of the story, Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, here portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara. The movie begins with her job interview in Hitler's office. Hitler is seen through her eyes as the 'loving uncle' idealist, who indulges her errors, who has hired her for the position because her background is one he connects with out of his romance for his own student days in Munich. Ganz's Hitler isn't the pop-eyed monster from propaganda films, but resembles more closely the guy who brings milk and cheese to your doorstep. Both characterizations reek of what Hannah Arendt called the 'banality of evil'. It is not necessary to sympathize- but I believe the creators of this project are trying to get their audience to understand how easy it could be for an 'advanced' civilization to crumble into this kind of homicidal delirium. It is a huge undertaking, and while DOWNFALL is far from as comprehensive a movie as one which attempts such a task needs to be, it is an important effort at this moment. Our own time is one in which the professional classes of the western world teeter between a re-awakening of the democratic impulse, and the authoritarian ambitions and imperial designs of late capital. It may seem ludicrous to some to suggest that the west could actually repeat the experience of fascism, but the prime components for such a movement- lower middle class despair, professional class vanity, national myths, infrastructural decay, are in full throttle in the United States, a country which has always been notoriously inattentive to its own political culture. Sad to say, anything could happen in this world of 'tea parties' and Obamian new age political cults. Fascism as a movement emerged out of the violent antipathies of the professional classes of Germany, the despair of the German workforce shattered by world war and economic depression, capitalist culture driven by late junker speculation, and religious and cultural mysticism. DOWNFALL works as a film because it shows us these twisted political fervors and what they do to people. Its focus as a work is less on Hitler's personality then it is on the mass pathology- to use Erich Fromm's phrase- that made such a violent dervish possible. That's why the work is devastating.The images of Hitler youth, or early teens out fighting Stalin's armies- which, in one of Stalin's rare moments of being on the correct side of history- were administring the death blows to the Nazi mayhem,the images of Frau Goebbels poisoning her children, these are the essence of fascism, far more so then Hitler's personality. The film focuses on what certain political cultures do to people without becoming a work that is tendentious or 'preachy'. It shows us how it must have been in those last days of the German holocaust. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has given us a powerful gift. It's not one that's easy to open, but it's a lesson from history that has to be confronted earnestly. DOWNFALL provides us with just such a tool.",Null,3,6,15 March 2006
Carrie," a glimpse of the bitter cosmic gumbo ya ya personified
","The fortieth anniversary of the release of this masterpiece has come this winter. Many people know this work and many less remember how jolting it was when it appeared on the big screen that year, and much of its impact is lost in the age of audience addictions in the United States that require constant jump scares, endless action clichés and cgi. But CARRIE was released in a time and moment when plot and character development mattered a lot more than they do now, and it is small wonder that this little grand guignol garnered as many academy award nominations as it did. It is safe to say that everybody knows the story, what with the popularity of the original King novel and the many poor remakes that have been made. So I won't recount any of that here. But even now, some of us still marvel at its subtle depiction of an ugly side of U.S. character that manifests in public schools, a sense of entitlement that magnifies the organic tendency of adolescence to unwarranted cruelty. Stephen King's CARRIE is an exercise in terror, but under Brian DePalma's masterful cinematography and pacing the story line developed into a meditation not only on the given story-line but a reflection of who we were becoming as a people long before the emergence of one Donald Trump. Consciously or otherwise, CARRIE is a masterful satire on that ugliness, the bland acquiescence of middle class life, the vast limitations of orthodox faith,enforced isolation and the death of curiosity in our culture. That seems a lot to claim for the work, and I would never say that this was the director's intent. It wasn't. It's just that, as the Situationists used to say, certain home truths come creeping out in popular form/expression, whether we would have it so or not. However, this sort of dialogue was alive and thriving when the film was made in those post Vietnam and post Watergate years, which gave us a genuine look at where we were headed. And it is for this reason that all of the remakes have been so unsatisfactory. The latter films focus on social ugliness and revenge and have no sense of subtlety or wit. The big money that backs film making in the United States today would have us believe the absolute worst about ourselves, but that's not what's going on with the original.CARRIE is pure fantasy, a nightmare, but one that has a rigorous unspoken underpinning. Her character even at its most malevolent is far from the 'evil bitch' caricature that people laugh about, it is actually the rage of an energy some 'primitive' cultures called the Corn Goddess. It is sweet and benign when not insulted by the ugliness of who we can be, but wrathful when pushed to the limits. And though I am sure this is far from any of what the director consciously intended, all of those things are there for those with eyes to look. The work is marvelous, a glimpse of the bitter cosmic gumbo ya ya personified, and this is why if our sad world is still alive a thousand years from now, people will still be talking about this film.",10,0,0,7 March 2003
