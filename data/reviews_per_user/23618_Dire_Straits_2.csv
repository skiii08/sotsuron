Vertigo," _almost_ a waste of 2 hours 9 minutes...
","I watched Vertigo for only the 2nd time yesterday (the first time being some 15 years ago). I had forgotten most of the plot, so I was hoping to be surprised.I was surprised. This movie, although it's VERY NICE to look at with it's vibrant colors and lovely San Francisco scenery, is simply a boring film.There's a lot of unnecessary footage in the film; this movie could have been cut by 20-25 minutes and it would have been a better film.I LOVE most of Hitchcock's stuff; this really doesn't seem to resemble anything I know of Hitchcock, save Jimmy Stewart (who acts like Jimmy Stewart on Grateful Dead Mushrooms). Stewart acts rather strangely...I don't like his character at all. If he was any kind of actor at all - he would have been scary (perhaps). Instead, he comes off looking deranged...and not because he has vertigo. Novak comes off as stupid - watch the movie and you'll see what I am talking about.I'm not really sure at what Hitchcock was trying to do in this picture...the animation and dream scenes DO NOT HOLD UP AT ALL. As a matter of fact, they seem juvenile.A rather convoluted story doesn't help, but this picture wasn't bad - just very tedious and a lot of pointless, wasted time during the first hour of the film. Plus Hitchcock uses a lot of McGuffin's and he stretches them -at times- beyond what he should. Maybe it was all a joke. I'm not alone in this - many professional reviewers have said the same thing.The best job of acting in the film is done by Barbara Bel Geddes and sadly, that's not saying much (although she is very pretty in 1958 - she's more alluring to me than Kim Novak).",6,5,15,24 May 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Beautiful film - great plot but...WTF?
","I had heard about 2001 practically my whole life of 33 years before I actually got to see it. The anticipation for this film was fantastic on my part. I simply could not wait to see what Kubrick had cooked up; my brother - the family sci-fi expert - wouldn't part with any details.So I sat down and watched this movie in complete silence and isolation - wanting not to be bothered and to focus completely on the film and every aspect of the 'Kubrick Masterpiece'.Half-way through the film, I was thinking to myself, 'This is one really great movie!' I could sense Hal going nutty by this time and got chill bumps...oooh what would come next? Three-fourths through the film, I'm sitting there with a ruffled brow and a scrunchy nose, wondering if this is Kubrick directing or Fellini.When the film was over, I was MAD. So mad that I said I'd never watch the movie again. What kind of ending is that? The feeling I had is the feeling you get when you invest time and money in a girl that you have deep affections for and instead of returning those affections, in one way or another, she simply tells you that she loves you like a brother. I was hurt by the ending, literally. How in the name of all that is classic cinema can this movie end the way it did? I'll never understand why. And I will never understand the meaning of it - ever. It's simply not fair to end what truly is a beautiful - and to some extent - great movie this way.Whatever the meaning is at the end - and I tend to agree with some that it has something to do with the whole evolution cycle of ape to man to computer to - 'whatever it was in the green room that supposed to represent whatever'...agrgh! Just reliving the ending - which I have not seen in some 7 years still makes me very angry.It is such a beautiful film, though. One should see it. It will always be remembered. And I fear, most will be confused and angry afterwards.",6,3,8,25 January 2005
