Skyfall," A Truly Awful Movie.
","One of the worst films I have ever seen. Every single scene was flawed and had errors. From beginning to end the movie had mistake after mistake. Now most movies have one or two mistakes and you just over look it but when it happens in every scene of the movie, you can't just wave it to one side.For example, when Bond leaves the London underground and starts running to save M. Here we have TWO errors. Firstly, M does not do MP's committee meetings and secondly, why does Bond run half way across London to get to her? Why not stop one of the police officer's to either drive him or to give him the car? There are so many errors, like I already said in EVERY single scene of the movie.Few others that I still remember are such as the opening scene, why does Eve who just mistakenly shot Bond with an automatic rifle not then open fire on the bad guy? How did Bond even survive such a drop? How did he end up in the arms of a beautiful woman on a beach? How did Eve even miss shooting him jumping on the train earlier? Why did the bad guy who had an automatic pistol and had Bond pinned down behind a wooden market stall decide to jump on a motorbike rather than to kill him? Why did the police bikers even drive straight towards a man firing a weapon? How did Eve even turn up with a vehicle just as Bond left the building? So many errors and so many gaps and that's just the first 8 minutes! I can go on and on and on. EVERY scene had massive errors, Even the Aston Martin DB5 scene, how comes Bond has it? Why would he even run away with M and get her killed? Are the SAS on strike? How did Bond leave the casino in Macau after killing 3 bodyguards? Does a large casino only have 3 security guards? Why even would they fight? Surely they would have just shot him as soon as he enters the casino? Javier Bardem's baddie character was ridiculous and comical. It was totally unbelievable, even an 8 year old wouldn't believe the storyline. Poor acting and the camp/gay innuendos were painful to watch. I couldn't believe what I was watching.This was an appalling movie. It relied on Judi Dench to hold it all together. Sadly I am not able to give it a 0 so I will give it 1/10. No action in the movie what so ever after the opening scene. Two men hugging on top of a train has been done so many times. Pathetic movie and the only people who will enjoy this are the brain dead. Shame on critics who were saying this was the best Bond movie ever, you should be ashamed of yourselves.I used to like Daniel Craig as Bond but thanks to this movie I now dislike him too. Well done to Sam Mendes and Co, it takes a certain amount of talent or the lack of it to single handedly destroy Bond. The hero in this movie was the final credits, the real baddie in this movie was the man behind the camera.",1,447,821,7 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Possibly The Worse Movie Ever made
","I am a huge Star Wars fan. Rogue One is totally lame. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, forget Star Wars for a second, even as a stand alone movie it was utter rubbish. The acting in general was good except for Forest Whitaker who was way over the top and cringe worthy as was Donnie Yen. The CGI was good and gave the movie the Star Wars feel but the script was criminal and weak.If you are a fan of Aliens and the movie Predator, as I am, and somehow found yourself watching AVP and being hugely let down then Rogue One will have the same effect on you.It was so boring, i felt like going home and opening YouTube and watching a fan made Star Wars movie instead, they are no worse than this garbage.We all know that Star Wars movies have got worse over the years but to make a film as bad as this takes skill! I cannot believe movies like this are allowed to be made. It was a monotone attempt. Do not bother watching this, you will only ruin your childhood memories of Star Wars.The reviews on this site claiming the movie was good probably worked on the movie or are bought reviews. This was sooooo bad. It should have never been made.",1,43,88,17 December 2016
The Hateful Eight," Possibly The Worst Movie Ever Made
","This movie is a perfect example of modern movie making. It was totally pointless and boring. I don't think I have watched a movie as stupid as this. Even by Tarantino's standards this really sucked. It does not have the charm of Django Unchained. Even the use of the N word seemed awkward and pointless in this movie unlike other Tarantino movies. The acting was poor and the movie was too long. You could have edited this movie into 30 minutes instead of 3 hours! Utter garbage and a huge let down and is no comparison to the awesome Reservoir Dogs or even the silly-but-hugely-enjoyable Pulp Fiction.The only good thing about this movie is that if anyone you know who tells you this movie was good will save you money on future films. Just ask them before you go to your next movie, if they say it was good then avoid it. Just like some of the reviews on here that seem to be planted by those who were involved with the film, they all says it was a 'masterpiece' but don't give any details to back it up.It was a master piece of s***",1,227,501,22 December 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Dumbest and most boring movie ever
","Silly, stupid, boring and way too long. Nothing happens, there is no real story, it's just total rubbish but people will shout out it's 'amazing' only because of Tarantino. If this film was made by anyone else we would have all torn it apart for being so rubbish but the sheep and hype will praise this film for no reason. It's just a truly stupid movie and just drags on and on with utter nonsense. I love Tarantino's early work such as Resevoir Dogs and of course Pulp Fiction but this is really bad. Sorry for being honest and it seems I am the only one here that is. Very bad movie don't waste your money on it, there's two funny moments in the film but nothing you have not seen before.",1,30,52,28 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," We all knew it was going to be a let down........
",A missed opportunity. The biggest let down of this movie was the script everything else was great but the story was lazy and a massive let down.Well what did you expect from a Disney Star Wars. This could have been a great movie if the script had actually been written with some passion. It had the right ingredients but lacked any taste. The actors were great and seem to blend in just fine but every scene seemed to be stolen from past Star Wars movies and yes I know any real Star Wars fan can tell you that George Lucas admittingly stole the Star Wars story from a 1958 Japanese movie but this was blatantly copying Lucas.I feel all future Disney Star wars movies will be a let down. What a shame.I could go into how the script could have been better but i am guessing nobody here would be interested in that. Just a few tweaks to the story and characters and this movie would have been a special movie moment such as in 1977. Unfortunately this is just another Hollywood mass production.,1,55,79,22 December 2015
Spectre," Mixed Emotions
","Spectre is a mess. The movie opens with a rolling shot in Mexico which is stolen from legendary Orson Welles' Touch of Evil opening scene (youtube it).SPOILERS AHEAD: Then we head off to Rome. A car chase with the two sexiest cars on the planet is ruined by the music, i would rather hear the cars! The music in general is straight out of Skyfall which isn't a bad thing because it creates a link to that film.Sam Mendes enjoys ruining every scene by having two or three story lines happening at the same time and all edited into each other. Such as in Skyfall, the opening scene had Bond fighting on a train, Moneypenny doing her best school run in a Land Rover and M in London shouting into Bond's ear every 2 minutes. 3 things all happening at the same time! Spectre is no different.Biggest irritant of Skyfall and Spectre is how slow the dialogues are. It seems ages for the next person to speak/reply. Bond says something in his slow manner then you could go and make a cup of tea come back and you wouldn't have missed the reply by the other character. the gaps are so wide it annoys me. This is acceptable and usually happens in theater because it is live, there are nerves, distractions or even forgetfulness but it is so dull in a recorded motion picture. it should be fast and draw you in, keep you interested.Spectre is like a fan-made bond movie edited with an episode of Spooks (UK TV series).The movie has some witty moments and dry English humour which adds to the film but the whole film feels badly made and cheap. Where did all the money go? The script isn't as bad as i was expecting it to be after reading some early reviews. It had its clever moments but silly and simple mistakes were made. Better word choices would have lifted the film. It all seemed so rushed.The title song, not that it matters, was beautifully written and the instrument arrangement was spectacular but the vocals were painful to the ear. It wass like listening to opera at the wrong speed. The cast look old and tired. They all seem bored. This could have been an excellent movie but it doesn't bother to be one, it's a new uber-hyped Bond movie, everyone will go to see it even if you tell them it was rubbish. There are enough hardcore Bond fans around the world to make its money back without having to try much. Bond movies have a formula and that appeals to many.Lets face it Bond is a killer and we enjoy watching him kill in the name of 'good'. It is our fantasy world where we celebrate cold blooded murder in the name of politics and national security when lets be honest here, there is no threat, what do we care if someone wants to takeover a pipeline or water company in the middle of nowhere.Bond is starting to show its age and they are running out of ideas and the fact that we don't have any real enemies anymore, Bond seems useless as ever. It worked well during the cold war but now this illuminati chasing Bond is having a hard time. So now we have become more interested in Bond's past. To be honest I couldn't care, i would rather be entertained at the cinema.Skyfall was awful but visually it was stunning, Spectre is similar but doesn't look half as good as Skyfall. You could edit both movies into one then you might have a half decent Bond movie.The ending of Spectre is tragic, it is so terrible it angers me just thinking of it. How the hell do you shoot down a helicopter half a mile away with a .380auto gun?! What were they thinking of! But then again this movie has a storyline stolen from Austin Powers, that says it all.Mr Waltz was poor and very one dimensional, he just didn't come across as someone with a painful past or evil tendencies. He did it well in Inglourious Basterds though. (Being Austrian and wearing a German uniform naturally added to the part) Please let this be Sam Mendes last Bond movie, he still thinks it is 1935, i want to see an ultra smooth ultra modern Bond. Makes no difference to me personally if Mr Craig does another one or not but if i had to choose, i hope Spectre was his last.I give it a 1 for the crew who were the real talent of this movie, their work and effort is visibly enjoyed.The next Bond movie must update the character, a young bond, perhaps introduce a female '00' to work with 007. No more DB5, give him a current vehicle, doesn't even have to be an Aston, maybe an AMG Benz. Get rid of the .380 peashooter. Give Bond a Glock 43 or a Beretta Nano. Make him in his late 20's add some youthfulness to the franchise, and no more bedding every woman he speaks to for 5 minutes.okok i'll shut up now, just frustrated with all of this 'real bond' nonsense.",1,46,95,10 November 2015
