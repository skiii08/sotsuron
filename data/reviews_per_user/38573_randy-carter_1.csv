United 93," Not worthy of the Big Screen
","This would better serve us all as a Sunday afternoon documentary. I can't believe I spent $20 for my husband and I to sit through such jumpy and shoddy camera angles, poor lighting, garbled sound and unprofessional acting. We are not given the opportunity to embrace the passengers, because we don't get to know them at all on a personal level. We weren't able to even know who Todd 'Let's Roll' Beemer was until the last couple of minutes of the movie. All I felt as I was leaving the theater was more anger towards Muslims and confusion as to why this movie was ever made. Save your hard earned money and wait for this to be shown on PBS.",2,9,36,29 April 2006
