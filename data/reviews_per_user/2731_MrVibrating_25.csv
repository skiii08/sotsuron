Come and See," Depressing, mind-boggling and unique
","Idri I Smotri is the most horrifying war movie you'll ever see. No, I have not seen every war movie but I've seen many and none of them were remotely close to this.If an American war movie is considered anti-war, you usually see really gruesome stuff happening to soldiers. American movie wars are fought in computer servers, a totally unpopulated battlefield were the troops can run around and kill each other. If a movie shows bad stuff happening to civilians, it's always limited and often implied.Idri I Smotri goes all out and shows you the whole thing. Rape, murder, massacre, brutality in every way imaginable. There is very little plot, a tool to further show the randomness and confusion of war. The happenings on screen are often bizarre and unexpected, and dialog is confused, desperate, hopeless and often barely human.On top of the ghastly pictures is a whine, drone, noise, call it what you will. I'm guessing someone call's it 'soundtrack' but that's too generous. It's nauseating, and very effective.Acting is extremely believable, characters feel real as life. That doesn't mean they are likable, rational or enjoyable, but they're undoubtedly there, experiencing first-hand what we are seeing filtered through or TV screen.I will never forget this movie. It leaves a mental scar in your mind which takes a few days to recover from and you'll probably never recover fully. If you've seen movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'We were soldiers' and felt they were too strong, DON'T watch this movie. If you never feel terribly affected by movies, well, you'll soon know what it's like.",10,22,31,2 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Solid movie with clever script...not terribly entertaining though
","Smilovic's script is undoubtedly the strongest part of 'Lucky Number Slevin'(in case you're wondering 'why the retarded name?' the explanation is in the movie). It's wholly based on twists and turns, with the more and more tiresome(but still working) 'look-at-all-the-clues-you'll-only-notice-in-the-second-viewing' revelation at the end. The problem with such a script, of course, is that the movie has to be pretty damn good for you to want to watch it again. Lucky Number Slevin isn't that good.The actors are all big names, but none of them are giving it what they really got. It was nice seeing Lucy Lui in a role not totally stereotype, as usually happens to her. Morgan Freeman was a gangster, but still his usual jovial self, nothing new under the sky here, except a momentary emotional outburst at the end of the movie. Harnett was pretty forgettable, along with the rest of the cast.Directing is professional, camera-work too, with nothing to complain about. The sets and location are well-chosen, which is something you don't usually notice. Music is pretty bland, there's strings when you should be sad, and some more strings.This is worth seeing in the cinema or renting, but nothing you'll want to watch more than once or twice.",7,1,3,31 October 2006
In Bruges," Morality, violence, character acting, what more can you ask for?
","In Bruges was one of those movies you could see becoming great from a distance. The trailer definitely showed promise and the cast and concept seemed good. A while went and I forgot about it, but then it suddenly movie popped up again, so of course I went to see it.Not really sure what to expect other than Colin Farell, and old guy and Ralph Fiennes interacting in the bizarre location of Bruges, Belgium, the movie was a delightful surprise. There is a good dose of humour, dark and somewhat lighter, and there's more humanity than in all of Hollywood's summer blockbusters combined.Superficially a slow actioner, In Bruges is a morality play, which shows the new-comer director's background in the theater. The interaction between the characters, the amazing twists and turns of the story and the great acting between the three lead men(Brendan Gleeson a surprise to me, his Harry Potter role did not impress but how could it have?) is the main thing to expect from this movie, with a clever and exciting climactic ending to top it off.If you liked Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, or Layer Cake, or any other subtle off-beat dark comedy, then this is definitely for you. Beware of blood and violence at some parts, and heavy themes at others. This is not a movie to take lightly, but give it a chance, it's worth it.",9,3,8,5 July 2008
Monty Python's Life of Brian," One of my all-time favourites
","While Quest for the Holy Grail was funny because it was so low-budgetty and silly, Life of Brian is more advanced and with a greater variation of humour. It also has a bigger budget, which is great to see. Every scene looks realistic, and the sets (someone said they were formerly used by 'The Last Temptation of Christ?) are great.Almost every line in this movie is a classic, and all of them very quotable. The characters are hilarious, and out-of-this world zany.The plot is good, and contrary to the Holy Grail, it actually comes to a satisfying conclusion.The movie also dares to joke about religion. No, they don't joke about Jesus or God, but about the believers in them. The line 'I say you are Messiah, and I should know. I've followed a few' is so spot-on it hurts(when I laugh).All in all, watch this. This is possibly the funniest movie ever created. You can't afford to miss it.",10,74,133,27 December 2005
Akira," Deep-cool, a great and rare combination
","Not often does a movie come out that has both kick-ass action and storyline, but also a deep hidden meaning and some huge questions. 2001 must have been one of the first, even though it's 'coolness' has faded over four decades. Since then, every now and then movie-makers has decided to coat existentialism with action-packed innovation. Matrix is one of the latest to mix the two in a good way.Akira is another of those movies. The story starts out on a pretty basic level but quickly unfolds at a brisk rate which forces you as a viewer to keep your eyes peeled. This is made very easy in Akira by the amazing visuals, the fast and sometimes mysterious storyline and a kicking soundtrack.Akira is raw and uncompromising, the action is over-the-top and spectacular, the setting(Neo-Tokyo) is fantastic, and the characters intriguing. At the end of the movie, we also get a good dose of theology/science ideas thrown at us for good measure. Combine all of these and you're in for quite a ride.Akira was one of the movies that started the Manga phenomena outside Japan. It's not hard to see why. Even though I've seen very little Manga, the few movies I have seen has convinced me that the Japanese have a lethal advantage over Western animation. Nothing wrong with that either. The best outcome is, of course, that Hollywood smartens up and starts to come up with some cool ideas themselves. We'll just have to wait and see. Until that happens, there's still a ton of Japanese movies to see.",10,4,7,23 May 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Much better than Dawn!
","This is what the zombie movie genre should have been. A comedy. I really disliked the original DOTD. I can see that it started a trend, but why is beyond me, since it's so appallingly bad. Not only is the setup a bit silly(slow-moving brainless easy to spot zombies taking over the world? Yeah, right) but the movie takes itself so seriously, and the fans even more so. Shaun of the Dead doesn't, and that's its strength.The movie starts as a normal relationship comedy, and Shaun is our regular loser. The whole problem of the dead walking begins just as any problem; something you hear on the news but ignore because you have worse problems. People's reactions to the zombie plague (Don't say the 'z-word'!) is actually pretty realistic and also funny.The movie uses gore in a good way, and doesn't indulge in it, like the 2004 DOTD remake. Since this is not USA, the Londoners have to use cricket bats and umbrellas instead of shotguns and colts. The classic mall is replaced with a pub, and when Shauns mum tells him she's been attacked on the phone, she refers to the zombies as 'a tad bitey'. It's very British, and I love that.The cast is good, especially Pegg, who shows a great range o emotions. The two usual zombie movie emotions, fear and expressionlessness, are nowhere to be seen. The supporting cast is good, and the zombie extras are great.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombie movies, and to other people too. Unless you have a weak stomach, this movie is good for everyone.",8,3,7,27 November 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," But isn't piracy BAD for movies?
","Lame joke, but I can't think of a good summary. Pirates of the Caribbean is a pretty decent summer blockbuster that received much acclaim thanks to massive marketing. It's not terribly original, it's not terribly funny(lots of the lines meant to be funny really doesn't work very well) and in the end, it's not terribly satisfying either.As movies come, it's solid and well-made and there's nothing to complain about in directing or the score, which both are good. The acting is one of the disappointments. Orlando Bloom is totally wooden as usual, Kiera Knightley doesn't exactly leave an impression, and Johnny Depp, although he is a god of acting, doesn't take his cool role nearly as far as he could have(with a script like PoTC's, there's no room for anything outside the frames of well-tried movie/money-making guides).The plot is the standard damsel-in-distress scenario and some Incan curse thrown in for good measure. Add a bit of Dawn of the Dead or the work of Ray Harrihausen in 'Jason and the Argonauts' and you have the storyline.I've watched PoTC two times and it has failed to impress me both times. It's a bit too violent to be appropriate to the audience I think would have appreciated it best, and a bit to childish to appeal to the rest of the movie-goers. Not something you have to see.",5,3,5,24 July 2006
Oldboy," Complex, challenging masterpiece that puts Hollywood to shame.
","While Hollywood is slowly choking to death on clichés and unrealistic budgets, the movie lovers turn their attention to Asia. Especially interesting is Korea's emerging movie industry. Japan has a long tradition of quality horror and anime and China dominates the epics with state-sponsored spectacles. Which place Korea will take we don't know but if Oldboy is any inclination it would be intelligent, disturbing drama-action movies.Oldboy has an extremely intelligent and edgy script, which will make you think and question your morals. It would NEVER be picked up in Hollywood. Even the initial concept of being locked up for 15 years without apparent reason would be deemed to strange for the audience. Thankfully, the Korean producers could see the brilliance of the script and give it a shot. It's budget is some $4 million, which is amazingly well used.Oldboy is very much the child of it's director, Chan-Wook Park, who's name should warrant a lot more fame than it does. The camera-work and pacing is amazing. There are virtually no dull moments. The fighting scenes are used to compliment to movie, not to give a reward after half an hour's boredom.The lead actors are no less amazing. Min-Sik Choi is a perfect anti-hero. Unlike the Western antiheroes, he even has the looks of an everyman, which makes his transformation so much more spectacular. The lead actress is a bit understates in my opinion, but memorable never the less. The best one is by far Ji-Tae Ju, the charismatic villain. He dominates every scene he's in, a sort of Korean Christian Bale American Psycho.Music and choreography is great as well. All the details and the grit makes the movie really come alive. At the end, you are in awe, a rare feeling for a movie. The feeling stays with you for days. Occasionally you will think of the movie and shake your head, unbelieving someone could actually pull it off.So do yourself a favor, watch Oldboy. You will not be disappointed.",10,76,129,20 October 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," Extremely cute(in a good way!)
","If you see a movie like 'My Little Pony', you think 'CUTE!' and feel like puking. That's a common trait in children's movies today. Too many bright colours, boring and dumbed-down dialog, and tired and boring concepts.This usually stems from the problem that only grown-ups make movies. But this movie is also made by grown-ups. So what's so different? I think Miyazaki has very good contact with his inner child. It sounds corny, I know, but he's spot on with every line, every movement, in fact everything the wonderful two sisters do in this movie.American child heroes are usually very grown-up. They speak pretty much like an adult. They remind more of the kind of children we see all the time in horror movies(the kind who has black makeup under the eyes and says eerie things to the main character) than real children. If they're not like that, they're painfully cute and stupid. But not in this movie.The plot is wonderful as well. It's magical enough to appeal the children and serious enough to affect grown-ups. It's a rare mix. Most importantly, it's gripping. You really care for the characters, you feel happy when they're happy and you feel bad when they're in danger.In conclusion, Totoro is a really cute movie but not in the usual brain-dead way we Westerners have become used to. It's as good as Disney in its prime, and in some ways better. It's easily the best movie you can let you children watch made in the latest 20 years. Mom and Dad might want to turn off the dubbing and watch the Japanese version as well.",10,4,5,14 May 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," A good disaster movie(!)
","Very few of these has come out for a while. A solid, good, disaster flick. Good use of CGI(Unlike Armageddon. Ugh.) and a good story, even if it's a bit unrealistic(Unlike Deep Impact. Ugh again). I usually laugh a bit at normal disaster flicks like Perfect Storm and the likes. This movie had me entertained but not laughing at it.Jake Gyllenhaal shows about 5% of his capacity(watch Jarhead and Donnie Darko) but it's OK. Acting is pretty general in this movie, no real stinkers or real stars. Again, no big deal. It's a disaster movie.The plot: Ice Age is abound and Dennis Quaid has to save his son from a frozen New York. There's even a nice Karl Rove-ish vice president in there not caring. Me like.The effects are, as I've said, very good. It's chilling to see a giant wave hit NY, especially after the recent disasters... Anyway, it's hard to elaborate on this movie. Just see it with an open mind and don't be nit-picky and you'll enjoy it.",7,1,2,25 January 2006
Silent Hill," A very good thriller.
","Don't think you have to have played Silent Hill in order to 'get' or even appreciate Silent Hill the movie. I haven't, and I think the movie stands very well on it's own.The imagery is without a doubt the strongest part of the movie. The camera-work is superb and varied and always fitting, and the subdued colours are perfect and moody. The special effects are often really cool and more often than not well integrated in the rest of the scenes, something not even really huge productions manage to pull off all the time.The second strongest part was the sound. The score is haunting and hangs heavy over the scenes. The air-raid signal, the first time it's played, sends chills down the spine. The silent parts are well placed as well and you want them both to end and not to end, since they really add to the tension.The story is smart, not the usual Hell invades fare(ala Doom), but shows the dangers of fanaticism. The acting is pretty solid. Although the movie breaks the 'Creepy adult-ish child'-quota(No more than zero per movie), it's done with style and not just for it's own sake.Overall, the tension was great. Some scenes were disturbing, some scary, some just plain cool in their blood-curling way. For those who like horror movies and are tired of clichés and jump scenes, this is one of the pleasant surprises of the 00s.",8,4,7,2 August 2006
Corpse Bride," Burton does it again
","We all know Burton love the Gothic, the dark and the comically twisted. He uses it in all his films, in one way or another. But he is also very diverse. Movies like 'Ed Wood', 'Mars Attacks!' and 'Big Fish' are proof he can do other styles as well. But in this movie, Burton does what everybody expects him to do, and boy does he do it good.The art style of this movie is perfect, flawless and as Burtonesque as anything can be. The use of stop-motion puppets instead of the more and more tiring CGI gives the movie a realistic feeling and makes it feel more artsy.The story might be the movies weak link but I never thought about it during the movie. Besides, it's an old folk tale, so it's bound to be pretty basic.Danny Elfman. That makes a few roll their eyes but Burton and Eflman is a good team, actually. The songs in this movie were not as good a those in 'Nightmare before Christmas' but the suited the movie fine and they were never annoying.The voice work is fine, Christopher Lee is great, and the characters are really characteristic and alive, ironically enough. Johnny Depp might be a little wasted since his character is pretty unremarkable, but his involvement has to do with his friendship of Burton and not as a poster name.I recommend this movie to those who liked Tim Burton's earlier movies. You might not be surprised or totally blown away, but masterful handiwork like this is to be encouraged in these times of repetitive CGI children's movies. If you do not like Burton's very special style, then this movie is not for you, but for us who like a little originality in our lives, this is just right.",7,3,4,17 February 2006
The Caine Mutiny," A classic.
","With excellent performances all around, a water-proof script, and good directing, The Caine Mutiny stands tall to this day. Unlike many other movies from that time, this one feels and looks modern in many aspects, and with its, for the time, quite long running time(2 hrs and 5 minutes) it still doesn't feel stretched or dragged, in fact, some subplots would have been good if they were expanded.Bogart's performance is really gripping and believable. The way different people react differently to his actions and how their opinions are formed is high above average movie standard. Although I haven't read the book I'm guessing a lot of it shines through, which is really lucky. A more navy-friendly movie would have ruined a lot.The Caine Mutiny is a little of this and a little of that. There's the usual 'boat in the pacific/oppressive captain' plot, then there's the psychological plot, then there's a courtroom section, and of course, the moral problem of mutiny itself.For its age, The Caine mutiny is crisp, fresh and well-made. If you feel like watching a classic that doesn't have the oppressive weight of age over it, then this is a great choice.",10,1,4,4 October 2006
Jarhead," Best war movie in years...
","...except it's not really a war movie. There is no war in the movie, at least no fighting for the main characters. This was true for many of the soldiers deployed in Kuwait during Gulf War I, and I think it's refreshing take for a war movie.Technically, this movie is flawless. Beautifully shot, great contrasts and use of colour. The acting is great too, with no weak links. Gyllenhaal seems to have a great future of acting ahead of him, and Foxx was great as usual.If every big war get's a great movie, I'd say this is the one for Gulf I. Unlike 'Three Kings', which was more adventure-ish, this movie focuses on the soldiers and the stress they get from not getting to do, well, anything. As I've said, Gyllenhaal shows this in a very realistic way.10/10 In my opinion, everybody should be able to enjoy this movie, no matter what you thought of the war. This is a movie about soldiers, not politics. I recommend you see it, it's one of the best movies out there this year.",10,6,11,16 January 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Boring
","This movie is in my opinion over-hyped thanks to the big-name stars in the roles. That's the only interesting part of the movie, watching the actors interact and see them doing their work. Although I like most of the lead roles, I've seen much better performances. The plot is simple enough, a robbery of a casino. The only problem is that it's not a bit exciting. Everything goes smooth, nothing fails, and they get the money. Although a bit clever, it feels like the original parts are stolen from movies I have yet to see. When all's said and done, the movie leaves you with a feeling of being cheated of something; How did you get so many stars to make this boring movie? Anyhow, it might be entertaining to some, but there are far better crime movies out there.",5,1,2,25 April 2005
Pi," Darren Aronosfky doesn't disappoint
","Pi is an overlooked little masterpiece. Using the tricky subject of mathematics and combining it with heavy black and white footage, drug abuse, Lynchean moodiness and untested actors and still coming out with a great movie is an achievement, especially considering the movie had a budget smaller than the price of a good car.The actors are all unknowns, unless you regularly watch Aronofsky. The lead is very convincing and a treat to watch as he spirals into the scary world of number-obsessed big fish. His mentor is a lovely albeit stereotypical foreigner, well played by Mark Margolis. Supporting cast varies, as is expected, but on average excellent.The movie is shot in black and white, with contrast cranked up on max, and it looks surprisingly good. The 'effects' look lovely and though simple they are very effective. Some dark scenes are too dark but everything with lights looks gorgeous.The story is fast-moving and never dull, and there is a lot of well-built tension and awe-inspiring scenes. There are no jump scenes but plenty of scary and powerful moments. Warning, it WILL make you think.And last but not least, the MUSIC! Pi features a perfect soundtrack, so suited the movie even Tarantino can't brag next to it. When Massive Attack came on, I decided this was indeed an awesome movie. Lots of great(and suitable) techno, electronic and even stranger music. Not a soundtrack worth buying, but man, does it make the movie work.So all in all, Pi is a great late-night movie, can be enjoyed on your own and must be shown in pitch dark. Enjoy this lovely slice of weirdness.",10,2,5,12 January 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," The best feel-good movie of the 00s.
","Feel-good movies very often turn preachy, unbelievable or simply annoying. The great movie Rainman has one moment when it really balances on the edge of 'too much'; when Raymond lets his head hang on Tom Cruises after the hearing. Maybe it's in our nature; we cannot really believe that everything ends well with no-one getting killed or hurt in some way.That's why World's Fastest Indian is such an achievement. It is a biopic, but it contains basically no huge obstacles and dangers for our hero to pass. There's no-one tragically getting killed or dying for the sake of the plot, there's no villain or nemesis, basically none of the elements most movies have today to create an exciting story.What we do have is Anthony Hopkins in a role so far away from Hannibal he's forever on my list of really great actors. He's charming, he's a rascal, he's the kind of guy you'd want as a grandpa. On his trip he shows that a kind word and a smile get's you a lot further than threats of lawsuits or violence. It all feels realistic and Hopkins character is never naive; he simply knows that being himself is the right way. Few movies can boast such a happy and constructive view without the hero seeming super-naturally friendly and trusting.Acting is wonderful throughout the movie. Cinematography is great, from the dunes of New Zeeland beaches to the salt flats in Nevada, it's a beautiful movie to watch. The dialog's snappy and takes you for a linguistic tour from under down under to the real hicksvilles of Amurica. The event the movie's based on, the big race, is also a nice piece of movie-making.In closing, I recommend this movie to basically everyone. It'll melt a big chunk of cynicism out of you, and we all need that these days.",9,1,1,24 July 2006
Saw," Weak horror with way to much fuzzy camera-work
","Saw's trailer did get me a little bit excited. I had seen Se7en recently and since I was amazed at it, it was only natural I wanted to see more like it. However, I didn't bother to see this is a theater. I only just now rented the DVD.It starts off kinda promising, with the room and the setup, and I liked the stories of the other victims of Jigsaw, but a good concept is not enough to cover the clichés, the sad acting, the bad pacing, the plot holes, and worst of all, the horrible camera-work. It might be original, but there's a reason no-one has done it before; it sucks.The speed-up technique used to 'pump' the intense moments takes whatever coolness they could have had and turns it into more of a head-ache. Especially the car chase looks really retarded.In the end, we are rewarded with a sad excuse of a plot twist that was pretty easy to spot. I knew it from before, but my brother had never heard the story but he was onto it almost from the beginning. A lot of questions arise too, due to the sloppy script-writing. Why do that? Why wait so long? Why make this movie? In the end, Saw is nothing more than a quick cash-in at Se7en's popularity. It's much talked-about gore and sadism is weak and those who has seen good horror will not flinch or even care. Don't bother.",3,4,6,11 August 2006
Lord of War," Good-looking and important.
","The subject of gun-running is very political, very heavy and very unpleasant. Still, Niccol manages to turn this grave theme into a slick, sometimes funny, often emotional and very involving biopic.The story of Yuri Orlov, the Ukrainian immigrant who builds his gun-running empire from nothing, is intertwined with gun-running 101, the wars and conflicts of the 20th century, and corruption in the worlds largest governments. At points it reached the level of political-ism that can be called preachy, but steers off at the right time.Some scenes are very gripping. Some scenes make you shake your head since they are so absurd but still true. Example:(MILD SPOILER)'The AK47... It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do.' Some scenes are very darkly humorous. There's even a romantic relationship, and it's more realistic than many in movies.The camera-work is super. It doesn't succumb to any modern fads, like shaky camera JJ Abrams-style, or other silly techniques that ruin movies these days. Instead, we get crisp, sharp and colourful scenes. Russia is cold, dark, gray-green, Liberia is dusty, colour-rich and warm. Watching Lord of War is a treat.Nicolas Cage redeems himself after National Treasure. This is not his best performance, but a good one. Bridget Moynahan is boring as usual. That's just a personal annoyance though. Jared Leto works well as Yuri's crazed brother, and Hawke is good as the Interpol agent.One of the best performances comes from Eamonn Walker, as the sadistic Charles Tailor/André Baptiste. He and his son are both cruel to the point of silliness, which is exactly what you can say about African dictators.Lord of War is one of the better movies of 2005. It's important, it's well-crafted(the intro sequence is awesome), it's well-acted and well worth the money.",10,4,7,27 June 2006
Vanilla Sky," Extraordinary movie
","Vanilla Sky shows that a remake of a European movie doesn't automatically suck. This is largely because Vanilla Sky is pretty much a scene-by-scene copy of the original Spanish Abre los Ojos. The unique thing is, they do a much better job than the Spanish creators. Abre los Ojos get's credit for their cool idea and for a good movie, but Vanilla Sky takes that material and creates more than a brain-twister; it's simply an amazing movie.While the original had good actors, Vanilla Sky has better ones. Maybe it's because it's in English, but I think it's more than that. Tom Cruise plays the role of his lifetime, very believable and also likable as David Aames, the man with everything he could ever wish for. If you think Cruise is just a pretty face, just wait and see and the movie will prove you wrong. Penelop Cruz, returning from Abre los Ojos to repeat her role as Sofia, is cute as a button but in no way superficial. Cameron Diaz is simply scary and shows she handles a dramatic role excellently. The rest of the cast is also very good, down to little details.Direction is nice, with occasional quick cuts but mostly just solid and still interesting. New York always looks good on film and Vanilla Sky is no exception. There is a spectacular scene in the start of the movie that perfectly sets the mood for the movie.The biggest difference between Abre los Ojos and Vanilla Sky is the soundtrack. While Abre los Ojos had an alright soundtrack, Vanilla Sky's one is simply amazing, well worth buying actually. Every scene has a fresh, interesting and suiting choice of music, many songs so out- there for the scene but still very effective. 'Good Vibrations' is a good example of a song that really shouldn't work, but does.If you're looking for a mystery with some surreal overtones and a very satisfying ending(yes, it all makes sense in the end!), look no further.",9,9,16,11 November 2007
Iron Man," Finally a decent superhero movie
","Iron Man avoids many of the embarrassing clichés of the previous superhero movies. You know what I mean; the hour of boring explanation why the hero really needs to become more interesting, the pause half-way to ponder Responsibility or Redemption or whatever, the troubled love relations that doesn't make sense. Go away, says this movie, and what's left is entertainment, pure and simple.Although much of Iron Man contains the usual first-movie-in-series introducing and presenting, it is really funny and makes for solid entertainment. Unusual for a superhero movie. This is much thanks to the actors, all of them great but none as amazing as Robert Downey Jr. Still nervously babbling, but now with a touch of insufferable wealth and technical genius, we couldn't ask for a more pleasant performance. How this basically loathsome character can be so likable is all thanks to the writers and Downey Jr.There isn't an overdose of CGI either. Animatronic models where built and sets where constructed, which looks amazing in many scenes. The Iron Man suit itself looks superb and for once, I found myself thinking 'man, that looks real' instead of 'man, that looks cool'(or more often 'man, that looks fake'). Is Iron Man special or have we finally breached some sort of barrier here? The up-coming Hulk spectacle answers that question nicely: No, CGI still sticks out like a clown penguin. I guess Iron Man got lucky.All in all, Iron Man is better than most A-level superhero movies such as the Batman reboot or Spiderman. It is fun, engaging and clever, sometimes relatively original, and very, very likable. Go see it in the cinema while you have time.",7,1,2,13 May 2008
Heat," A great surprise
","I watched both Insider and Collateral, and I didn't like any of them very much. Mann's directing style was too hard to get for me. So I was not expecting too much in the way of directing in this movie, but was I blown away! The direction is great, none of the shaky hand cam stuff from Insider and not too much L.A. shots like Collateral.Then it's not Tom Cruise neither. It's Pacino and De Niro, and they do what they do best. The hardened criminal and the worn-out obsessive cop. They even get some screen time together, although little. But this is good, since having them together all the time would... I don't know, ruin the effect.The supporting cast is great. Pacino's wife and De Niro's girlfriend do a great job showing how normal women would react to their dysfunctional men. The smaller roles are great too. Fichtner is a bad guy, Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer criminals, and Ted Levine does a really horrible ogre-like psycho.The score is good, sometimes almost hypnotic and trance-like.* Spoiler Warning * The movie also contains the best and most realistic shootout in movie history.*/Spoiler* A must see for, well, everyone. Even if you didn't like Mann's other movies, I assure you that this is different, better.Marvellous. 10/10",10,4,9,9 October 2005
Click," Nice little moral lesson
","What starts out as a basic, yet toned down, goofy, predictable comedy evolves into a nice and touching story about family and life. Adam Sandler earns himself some more plus points to make up for movies like 'The Longest Yard' and the distressingly un-funny movies of his acting dawn.With a nice supporting cast, Kate Beckinsale, Sean Astin, David Hasselhoff, it's easy to predict the movie will be friendly and cheery and a bit funny. Thanks to adding Christopher Walken to the mix, things get funnier and at the same time a bit darker, like adding contrast to a digital photo.Walken's role is cool, he talks and walks cool, and he squeezes in a little dance scene(check!). He's a nice counterweight for all the cheery, wholesome characters. Thanks to the script, the story never get's too sentimental and never to cutesy. It keeps it at a good level over-all.So when the movie is over, you feel good. That's the point, it's a feel-good movie. And of all the feel-good movies out there, this one doesn't patronize it's audience. Thumbs up for that. There are still some bits with childish and low humour, but one gets the feeling Sandler is getting too old for it and that he's in a transitional state. Most of it is funny anyway so why complain.DON'T believe the trailer. This movie is much better than that.7/10",7,1,3,27 September 2006
Contact," A classic serious sci-fi
","In 2006, more Americans would vote for a black than an atheist for presidency. Nothing strange in that. In 2006, with the on-going Iraq war and the massive tensions between Western and Islamic values, more Americans would vote for a Muslim than an atheist. Now THAT is alarming.I'm not making a statement against Muslims here. I'm just shocked that, in spite of the Islamophobia, in spite of the radical fundamentalists in (nuclear?) Iran, in spite of the Muslims holding the no. 1 spot as Villains in movies, news and culture, Americans still think atheists are more untrustworthy.This is one of Contact's points. Without spoiling anything, it's safe to say that Jodie Foster's character is held back thanks to her (non)-belief. Instead, the good stuff goes to the believer, and in a spot of irony, it's also lost thanks to a believer. When I first saw Contact, I didn't find it very realistic that all the religious people would be more content with choosing a contending religion instead of a neutral part, but the numbers above stumps me.All politics aside, Contact is a great movie. The first scene sets the scope perfectly and beautifully. Some scenes are very, very tense, thankfully avoiding the Hollywood Happy Music and instead going for a subtle, dramatic and threatening score.This and Silence of the Lambs will always be the two best Jodie Foster movies. Even though she is a great actress, I can't believe she will ever top this. She is nicely balanced by Matthew McConaughey, who, coincidentally, is a man of faith. Jake Busey plays a truly unsettling character, Joseph, who shows the greatest sides of blind faith. We even get to see some of William Fichtner, which I always consider a bonus in a movie.The plot is grand, to say the least. Carl Sagan always was a man of visions and even though I have not read the book, I can feel the scope and scale of it is very Sagan. Some people mean that Sagan's strong anti-religious stance in the book is diluted in the movie, which may or may not be true. Personally, I think a movie that wants to open a dialog is worth more than one dismissing the other idea all together.When all's said and done, Contact is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made, in the genre's purest form. People who dislike Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien and the like, should not worry; Contact is thoughtful and more about humanity than anything else. It's rating here at IMDb, an American site, reinforces the aforementioned figures. Had it been the same movie with a pro-religious message, I think this would have been high up in the top 250, and I hope that one day it will be.",10,1,5,28 January 2007
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Wonderfully odd comedy!
","Coen movies are easy to spot. They have that feel, the feel of originality and oddity, the crazy story lines and characters. Oh Brother has all that. The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there, adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.The storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict. Giving credit to Homer is a bit silly, since the references to the Oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the story.Characters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect. George Clooney does the role of his life-time. Remember the usual, smug, to a varying degree annoying Clooney you see in every movie he's in? Forget him. This is another person. His two companions are good support and fodder for his clever remarks and half-baked plans.Since this is set in the 30's South, there are tons of things to use as comedic elements. KKK, crooked politicians, religion, rednecks... amplify that with Coen's script-writing talent and you will laugh. A lot. There is even one of the trademark hallucination scenes, kind of.What more can you say than: 'Thank you Coens!' I wont tell you to enjoy this movie. It's very simple. Just watch it!",10,9,12,18 November 2006
