Hereditary," Plainly put.....A tease.
","This movie was borderline great until the last 10 minutes with some genuinely jaw dropping moments. It was then as though the director remembered he need to finish the movie.
For a movie that comes in at just over two hours there is little to no explanation as to what is happening or why.
There are references to the occult, demonology and Paganism which the director is just expecting the audience to know about.
The topic has obviously been well researched with references to Satony, Zazas, Liftoath Pandemonium and King Paimon. But, what does it all mean? And what is the significance of the door mats?
To then descend into cheap gags and horror tropes ripped from other infinitely better Asian horror films was incredibly disappointing.",6,1,1,5 November 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Not particularly good.
","Overly long, not a particularly good story and very disjointed.
In all honesty, I only watched until the end out of respect for Spike Lee.
Worst movie I've ever seen him make.",2,3,5,18 June 2020
