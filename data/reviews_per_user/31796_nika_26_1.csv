Walk the Line," This movie touched my heart
","I knew some things of Johnny Cash but this movie really makes you see things from his perspective. I caught a pre-screening of this movie and absolutely loved it. People in the theatre were singing and laughing and feeling his pain. Surely their was more that could have been included, like his faith or some of his more famous songs, but it told his life story. How can you sum up a man's life in a couple of hours any way? I am glad that others will have a chance to see him and know him, even if they didn't know who he was until now. This movie was worth buying! Also Reece and Joaquin does an absolutely great job at singing his songs and really getting into character.",10,7,21,11 November 2005
