Resident Evil: Afterlife," Should only watch if you are a fan of the series
","I am a fan of the video games series, and I really enjoy watching this movie. Most of the enjoyment, however, comes from the anticipation and seeing how elements in the games are incorporated into the scenes, and I am very satisfied in this aspect, except for Wesker. I also like the dark, mansion-like, claustrophobic feel that was the first twenty minutes or so of the film, which brought back some good memory of playing the playstation classics.But if you are not a fan of the series, game or movie, then this movie is not worth the $15 ticket. First of all, this is an action movie, not a horror movie. There are zombies/monsters, but other than some suspenseful moments at the beginning, there aren't no scares at all, and the actions are quite dull.The fighting scenes are mediocre, and while there is lots of shootings, there is not enough variety of guns/firepower, which should be expected from a Resident Evil title, especially that which has a lots of elements from the game RE5. I'm also quite disappointed to see supposedly powerful bio-engineered monsters taken down with only a few shots from conventional weapons.Plotwise, this movie has no plot, and no character development. Chris Redfield seems to appear out of nowhere, with no apparent role in the plot, probably just to please the fans. I also find this movie racist toward the Asians.",7,4,9,9 October 2010
