Ghost," One of the best romance movies i've seen.
","I can't make a good comment on a movie because i don't have the talent and knowledge to do it, but i just have to say a few words about this one. It is without doubt one of the most charming movies i've ever seen. I may be mad but last month i've seen and is for the 13th time. It has a nice story, and it just makes you believe and love in the most genuine way that you can. The way Sam (P. Swayse) loves Molly (D. Moore) can inspire anyone to fall in love with 'love-story' movies, further more it contains a bit of action and i can guarantee you won't wanna leave the screen till the end of it. And because a film is never whole without a melody that matches it, this one has go the best one : 'Unchained Melody' from the extraordinary voice of The Righteous Brothers.It's frankly a movie to be seen that why i link it on to a 10.",10,3,5,3 March 2005
