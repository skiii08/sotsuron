The Ring," scariest movie i've seen
","********Nothing but spoilers****I've seen both the American and Japanese version. Even though I think the Japanese version makes a whole lot more sense, I was definitely more scared by the Naomi Watts rendition. One annoying difference was that every image on the deadly tape in 'Ringu' was an important clue. But on the American version, the truly disturbing images were the most useless. I was disappointed with the decision to sex it up by making Watts' character more dominant, but it made for a much more effective scare- especially in the last well scene. In the Japanese version, the ex husband lowers himself in and they drain the well. Creepy? Yes. The American version is hella scarier. The idea of being supernaturally pushed into murky water when you're pretty sure there's something in there with you is freaky. Samara was much more sinister in the American version. The flashbacks to her interviews in the insane asylum were too few and far between.  All in all, good times.",Null,1,1,23 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun fun fun
","I saw the previews for this movie in the theatres, but thought that watching it would probably lower my IQ somehow. When I heard that it was a summer hit, I scoffed thinking 'it figures.' But after a friend told me it's not that stupid and Johnny Depp gives a good performance, I rented it. I'm glad I did, since it's really fun, but not mind numbingly preposterous. Depp is stunning. Captain Jack just oozes charisma, and I eagerly awaited his return when he wasn't onscreen. I had no idea what this film was about, so the little twist was a complete shocker and quiet scary! I think Johnny Depp deserves the Oscar for his performance. Granted, the other guys gave powerful performances and what not. But Depp did too, and he took a lot of risks in his! None of the other nominees stole every scene of their respective movies. Also, their character portrayals were easily dictated by the script. But Depp created someone refreshing and new. The only thing I could say is that this movie is waaay too long. Three hours? And the fight scene in the cave had a few to many 'twists.' It didn't really need them. Oh well. It's still good over all. I'm glad that they are making a sequel.",10,1,3,23 February 2004
Resident Evil," subpar B movie
","I was hoping it would be creepier than it was. But as a few other posters already pointed out- the director is not very good at creating suspenseful situations or characters you care about. I agree with another poster who said that the editing was really disjointed. Characters appear in places, and you don't know how they got there. There are some plot holes as well, i.e. why was the 'cop' there to begin with? How did he know about the mansion? I knew this movie wasn't going to be a work of art or anything. I knew plot and all that were not that important, but at least it could have been scary.",4,0,2,23 February 2004
28 Days Later...," Hella Good Thriller
","I truly don't understand why some people have a virulent distaste for this film. And to say that it wasn't scary?! I wish they would explain why. I got pretty creeped out. Resident Evil was a very similar plot, with a known actress/model as the star, and expensive CGI effects- but the editing and scare gags weren't crafted well enough to make me jump. 28DL didn't have all the pricey stuff, but made good use of editing, camera angles, and the power of suggestion to create a much better atmosphere of dread. The actors were also much much better.********Spoiler Alert*******
I think Boyle does a great job with what he had to make an effective thriller. First, I think developing the characters more than most horror flicks was the first step because you then care about what happens to them. Also, the fear of being chased down and torn apart is much more relatable then backing into a corner waiting for the zombies to lumber over and surround you. That reminds me of a scene in Resident Evil when the team gets surrounded by slow moving rotten faced zombies. For some reason it didn't creep me out. But when Jim pleads for Selena to wait for him as they race up the flight of stairs whilst pursued by infecteds that you really don't even get to see, my stomach was in knots. I loved the Selena and Jim romance!!! I knew she liked him because she was mothering him so much- in a brusque way but nonetheless. The bossy little comments like:' don't get perishable food, Jim. Where are you going, Jim? Why, Jim? We already have enough food, Jim. Why didn't you tell me you were sick earlier, Jim?' or things of that nature. Her mother role for hannah took me by surprise though. I'm glad it happened but wished there was more development to justify it. The pace slowed down however when they reached the military base. Its not that I didn't like it, but it just didn't seem as suspensful. The third act gave me more of a 'looming danger' feeling. I knew those soldiers were gonna try something with Selena when they were driving back and one of them was eyeing her. I was afraid that it was gonna get really ugly because I hate rape scenes. When they started tearing off her clothes I started bracing myself to see something more disgusting than the last scene of Hannibal. I can't believe that Boyle said they toned down that scene after the original got a really bad reaction from test screenings. How far did they go? I know Naomie said she felt really bad about filming this scene. Even though its just acting, its still humiliating to have your clothes torn of by a buncha guys you don't really know. I think that the first alternative ending (which was the original one), would be more realistic. For heavens sake, he got shot point blank in the gut! But the theatrical ending would make more sense in the context of the story. I thought Jim symbolized hope and optimism. It's also a nice motif to end with: he wakes up on a bed, starting a new life. I am so glad they didn't even produce 'radical alternative ending.' It was just beyond stupid. Total blood transfusion? Jim sacrificing himself. How truly lame. Boyle should be embarrassed that he even came up with that storyline. About the digital video quality- it didn't have to look that way. Robert Rodriguez uses the same medium and his pictures look good- almost like 35mm. In 28 DL the grittiness works most of the time, but some shots are just atrocious. the worst are the closeups with Priv. Mitchell with Selena in tow, listening apprehensively to Jim moving about in the attic. They look like they used a cheap flashlight for lighting.",8,1,2,23 February 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Happily Surprised
","I just saw the movie a few hours ago and couldn't wait to write about how much I loved it. Eternal Sunshine is exquisite. It's an honest portrayal of the difficulty making relationships work. The sparks last until the other shoe falls, and you see how flawed your loved one is (and they see how flawed you are too). Relationships end because each is fed up with their mates annoying quirks. After breaking up (or being dumped) you may wish with all your heart that you never met that person or could wipe them from your memory. This film explores what happens when that becomes a viable option. Jim Carrey was perfect. Not only did he nail the dramatic performance, but he also added nuances of humor that I think only he could have done. If Ed Norton had the role I have no doubt he would do a great performance of heartache and turmoil. But Carrey uses his (handsome but) everyday Joe looks and demeanor to convince the audience that he's the quiet, level-headed one in the relationship. Then he busts out doing some pretty hilarious stuff. Kate Winslet is magnificent- she would do any role justice. I have to say that the movie also has some pretty harrowing chase scenes- if you can call them that. They effectively engenders the fear, urgency and desperation that so many conventional car chase scenes try to create. spoiler warning: Don't read further if you haven't seen it!!No matter how difficult a relationship becomes- you could at least learn from the experience and accept it or move on and never put yourself in that situation again. For instance, Mary thought it best that she erase her affair with Howard from her memory. She didn't know that it only lead to heartache because he wouldn't leave his wife and because of the pain it caused his family. Unfortunately with her memory of it all cleared, she developed her school girl crush again and acted on it- again. Kaufman also conveys his 'those-who-do-not-learn-from-history-are-doomed-to-repeat-it' message with a clever non-linear plot structure. Although we believe the first act is a portrayal of how Joel and Clementine first meet, we learn in the third act that this is actually how they reunite with all the exciting fury of a new relationship. After the movie returns to the events of the first act, it examines how Joel and Clementine deal with the discovery of their shared past and the issues they had with one another. Why should they try stay together when they know how much they can infuriate each other? Obviously to Kaufman, the desire to work out problems is stronger when the memory of their kindling love is not sullied by recent fights and mutual resentment.",10,0,2,11 April 2004
