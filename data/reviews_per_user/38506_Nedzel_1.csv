Requiem for a Dream," rent Pi and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore instead
","What made me angriest about this movie, what makes me angry about Hubert Selby Jr.'s writing in general, is the torture of innocent people.  Why in the world do we have to see Ellen Burstyn's character mercilessly destroyed? My perception is that the younger characters were drug addicts by choice but Burstyn was a victim, cruelly mishandled.  My esteem of Aronofsky has slipped since he teamed up with Selby.  Pi is a much more rewarding film as is Burstyn's performance in Ellen Doesn't Live Here Anymore.",Null,0,1,10 December 2001
