Requiem for a Dream," Bitter nightmares turned to visual reality
","I've seen hundreds, maybe thousands of movies in my life. Some were good, some were excellent. But this one..it exceeds excellent. The movie shows a climax on a painful personal subject to me so real, it was frightening. The acting work is superb, the style of filming is new and innovative, not to mention a way to really show the madness and insanity that drugs (and other addictions) bring with them.People, don't be fooled with a 'scenario' for this film. For some people..this is REAL life.A standing ovation to the actors & director, this is the best movie I've ever seen. And as far as I can expect, no one will succeed the impact this movie had on me for a long while.As a person to another, I suggest everyone who do drugs to watch this movie, and understand that this eventually can happen to everyone. Believe me, unfortunately...I know.",10,0,0,12 September 2001
