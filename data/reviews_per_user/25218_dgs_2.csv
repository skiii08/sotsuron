The Blair Witch Project," A good example of overhype
","The Blair Witch Project is not a true story and nothing in the film proved that the Blair Witch existed so I have come to a conclusion that all the horrors, the panic, the sounds and things these three filmmakers were experiencing was all in their heads because they were lost in a forest for days and nights losing their heads from thirst, hunger and hopelessness. Now that's what makes it a horror, but it's just not scary. It's more an overhyped, overrated drama than a true horror.",Null,0,0,23 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Didn't deserve the academy award for best picture...
","a bit funny...a bit romantic, but didn't deserve the academy award for the best picture... History buffs would hiss at this softened up, dumb insult to what could be a real life person or a fake (for example, Shakey didn't make up that Romeo and Juliet story, he stole it from a much older one.) otherwise, it's a witty, well written story that is one of the best films this year.",6,3,6,20 August 1999
