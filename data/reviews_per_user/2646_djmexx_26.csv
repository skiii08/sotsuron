Man on the Moon," superb briliant acting of jim carrey
","This is i think one of the greatest movie of Jim Carrey. he plays a person thats not really 100%, yust like in the cable guy, what i tought was a great movie to, there you can see the other site of Carrey. But man on the moon was great whit some briliant humor mixt whit som great drama. I did´nt knowe Andy Kaufmann in real person but that did´nt made it less great, it would be better ife you knowe him but who cares. It´s one of the greatest movie´s i have seen in times. You really need to watch this one to see the best site of carrey and for a good laughf too.",10,0,0,11 January 2001

From Hell," is it
","A very good thriller. Another respectfull thriller of johnny depp. I really love his films, in this story about jack the ripper, he's playing the chief inspectuer, who really wants to get the killer. It gives you the story how it would have been endet whit the real ripper, if i am correct. But this one changend my few on him for sure. not the best of johnny depp, but a good one.",8,0,2,23 March 2003

The Green Mile," a long one to
","This is a real fabulous and beatifull, whit some really good actors. The movie is about the green mile, the green mile is the way that leads to the alectric chair. I never get tears at a movie, but whit this one i did, that why i think the movie is so great(im glad i watchet alone). The great thing of the movie to is that it takes 3 hours before you can go on whit your normall life again, but the time wented very fast while watching the movie. I think it's one of the best movie around. Ive you like this one you must see Shaw Shank Redemption too!",10,1,2,27 November 2000

Final Destination," finally a good teener horror movie
