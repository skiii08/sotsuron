Love and Death," Groucho Marx meets Ingmar Bergman
",This is a better Marx Bros movie than the Marx Bros ever made (possibly excluding Duck Soup). Hilarious from start to finish.,10,3,3,11 May 1999
The Beach," Unconvincing
","I wanted to like like this film. Having spent some time in Thailand , I was eager to see a film in which Koh Phagnan was portrayed. Wow, was this dissappointing. No character development. Implausibility. Silly changes in tone.  This film has more shark attacks than Jaws. In warm water Thailand? The community's compound was reminiscent of a luxury resort, not a slacker hangout. The film's final third simply makes no sense. While I applaud the audacious and Non-Hollywood approach this film takes, it is a bold failure. Pretty locales, though.",3,2,4,4 August 2000
