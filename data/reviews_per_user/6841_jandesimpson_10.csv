Vertigo," A Vertigo enigma
","What can one possibly write about 'Vertigo' that hasn't been written before? In spite of its detractors, who have quite rightly been relegated to the bottom of this enormous pile of contributions, it has come to be regarded by so many as the crowning glory of the Hitchcock oeuvre. As one who would not quite rank it so highly, I could possibly dispute this at length but it hardly seems worth the effort from one whose prime motive for these reviews is to impart enthusiasms rather than dissatisfactions. In any case there is so much that I admire about the film. I only raise my eyebrows with incredulity when a critic such as Michael Wilmington places it on a level with Augelopoulos's 'Landscape in the Mist' ('Foreign Affairs' pub Mercury House inc.) or Donald Spoto's rating it as 'one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has given us' ('The Art of Alfred Hitchcock' pub. W.H.Allen). For what it's worth, I consider 'Vertigo' a tremendous entertainment, but not quite on the same level as 'The Birds' or 'The Wrong Man' which say so much more about the human condition. My only reason for writing anything that could be considered worthwhile about 'Vertigo' is to mention something that I remember as completely puzzling from several viewings over the years. It is a mystery that on a reshowing this week still doesn't become any clearer. Remember the scene where Scotty (James Stewart) follows Madeleine (Kim Novak) to the McKittrick Hotel. When he asks the receptionist about her he is told that although Madeleine is a frequent visitor she is not there at the moment. When he is taken to the room where he had seen her looking out of a window only a few minutes earlier, she is not there. When he looks out of the window for her car, even that has disappeared. For a director of earthbound plots that never venture into the supernatural this is the only sequence in the whole of Hitchcock that makes no sense. I rushed to Spoto whose excellent analysis of 'Vertigo' would surely offer enlightenment but even he seems at a loss to explain it, implying that the sighting of Madeleine at the window could be a figment of Scotty's imagination. He then rather wriggles out of it by citing another critic as saying it is an example of Hitchcock's 'knot in the narrative which people may ponder at home after the movie'. As I cannot think of any other such 'knots' in Hitchcock films I rather think this could be bunkum. So there it is, an enigma for which there must be some explanation, or am I missing the point?",Null,1,2,9 August 2010
The Monuments Men," My new role, champion of lame ducks
","I certainly didn't ask to become the champion of lame ducks but having been exposed to such diabolical reviews of the 2013 'Romeo and Juliet' and now an even worse batch on 'The Monuments Men' I suppose I shall have to accept the role. For the second time in under a year I find myself completely out of step. It is almost as if I have watched entirely different films from the multitude of pen blasters. Not that I would place these two works on the same level. Carlo Carlei's Shakespearian adaptation is for my money one of the finest cinematic takes on the Bard, a work imbued with passion, excitement and visual beauty that had me reeling to an extent I have not found anyone to share. Clooney's 'The Monuments Men' is no more than a worthy middle-of-the-road film, what in terms of literature one might deem 'a good read.' As I tend only to submit reviews of films of outstanding quality, as a means of imparting enthusiasm for those I particularly admire, I would not have been writing this. My motive here is rather different, to lambaste injustice that I find near incomprehensible. Not only is the exciting true story of the rescue of great works of art from the Nazis during the latter parts of the war well told, the art direction capturing the devastation of the period is visually most impressive. If the film has a fault which places it on a lower level than such wartime epics as 'The Great Escape' it is short on character development which tends to be swamped by emphasis on action. For once a better balance needs longer running time, rare to ask for from one of today's action flicks. Reports have it that George Clooney was deeply upset about the adverse reaction to what to all intents and purposes should have been a popular hit with audiences. If it is any consolation, George, I lapped it up and am probably as puzzled as you about the extent of such unjust denigration.",Null,0,0,2 February 2015
In Bruges," ...and now for something completely different
","I am always on the lookout for true originals. It's such a pity they so seldom happen. 'Eraserhead', 'Duel' and 'The Night of the Hunter' evoke the pleasure of something so completely different that it is easy to see why so much art house cinema is such a crashing bore. Don't get me wrong. I will always regard the work of Angelopoulos, Bergman and Satyajit Ray as absolutely supreme but there are so many lesser artists with so very little to say that one thirsts for entertainment that is not just mediocre time-passing but stimulates through courting the wholly unexpected. I discovered a wonderful example the other week and have to confess to being drawn to it a half dozen times since, so much so that I find myself beginning to quote lines in the same way that I do from 'The Third Man', 'Love and Death' and 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'. 'In Bruges' is a stunner. I won't begin to outline the plot as this has been done so many times elsewhere, rather will I just say that I adore the characters of the two Irish hit men and can only admire the way that the director has made a star of a city in as integral a way as any since Carol Reed's Vienna. To cap it all I love the dramatic irony of a scene towards the end involving size and coincidence that it would be wrong to give away, but which clarifies so perfectly much that is chaotic on a first viewing, resulting in a black comedy of extreme intelligence as well as one of enormous entertainment value.",Null,1,3,5 October 2009
Citizen Kane," Coming out
","I've been putting it off and putting it off but have finally decided to come out.  So here goes! . . .  I don't think 'Citizen Kane' is the greatest film ever made.  Indeed I would not be hard pressed to name a couple of hundred titles I prefer.  And while I am about it here is another piece of heresy; I don't find 'Casablanca' particularly entertaining.  And allow me just one more. . . I find the plot of 'The Maltese Falcon' terribly confusing but have never bothered to work it out as it just seems to be about several nasty people doing nasty things to each other in claustrophobic Los Angeles apartments.  There, that's me done for!  I doubt that anyone will take my cinema writings seriously again.  But back to 'Citizen Kane'.  It really is a very good film indeed, brilliantly inventive, its monochrome visuals as breathtakingly exciting as any I know.  It is so clever that one cannot but admire it; the wonderful 'March of Time' parody, the haunting use of deep focus photography in the childhood sequence, the disintegration of a marriage charted in a sequence of breakfast vignettes.  I wrote the other day of how the great Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi  achieved a wonderful marriage of the head and the heart.  What ultimately prevents 'Citizen Kane' from being a a great film to my mind is that it is all head and very little heart.  In 1941 the Oscars for best picture and director were awarded to John Ford's 'How Green was my Valley', a film that not only displays marvellous Hollywood craftsmanship but possesses such an abundance of heart that it just had to be the winner.  Take a look at Ford's earlier 'The Hurricane' (1937) and you will even see those sets with ceilings that 'Citizen Kane' is purported to have pioneered.",8,0,1,22 May 2002
Match Point," Woody's masterpiece?
","The problem about the really prolific artist is that compulsive creativity can so often generate work that is inferior to that artist's highest standards. When it comes to outstanding directors with a large oeuvre there is generally agreement about their finest and least good films. I would imagine that few would make out a case for Bergman's 'Now About These Women' when compared with 'Cries and Whispers', or Hitchcock's 'Jamaica Inn' vis a vis 'Vertigo'. But what to make of Woody Allen's substantial output? Here opinions tend to be more sharply divided. Most of his admirers plump for 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and her Sisters' as among the finest. But wait...here is one viewer who derives much less pleasure from these than some of the others such as 'Radio Days', 'Everyone Says I Love You' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery'. When I intimated to my eldest son - a great Woody fan - that I thought 'Small Time Crooks' the maestro's funniest film in years, I was sharply berated for my admiration of 'such a pile of cack'. So, even among fans and the most closely knit families there can be the sharpest of divisions about the relative merits of these sometimes splendid but often dire entertainments. Of only one thing can one be generally certain. Woody's fans, in my experience, tend to be men. In the circle where I move, the women seem to share a universal detestation bordering on the pathological. Which is by way of leading up to the admission that I have recently discovered a film that I feel could be his masterpiece. I whisper this as there could be many out there ready to shout me down. I find 'Match Point', the first of his London films, extraordinary in a variety of ways. First it is unlike any of the others, not an iota of humour, apart from a slight smile at the two cops toward the end and not a Woody sound/look/feel-alike in sight. It is the darkest of psychological thrillers dealing with adultery, ambition and murder. 'Thriller' is certainly an apt term as it generates a quite breathtaking tension as to what will happen next, and this for characters who, like those in Ang Lee's 'The Ice Storm', are not particularly nice and worthy of our concern. As far as tension goes there are echos here of Truffaut's great adultery piece 'Le Peau Douce' combined with elements of 'An American Tragedy' and Joseph Losey's perceptive examinations of British class malaise, a rich concoction that Woody succeeds in mixing in a way that gives so many clichés an entirely new flavour. The only Woody touch as far as I can see is his richly affectionate snapshot depiction of a great city, substituting his beloved New York for London. But perhaps the film's most satisfying feature is the brilliant use made of the tennis analogy when a ball substitute fails to make its intended destination - a moment of pure genius. It was my intention not to issue a 'spoiler' for a film where the element of surprise is crucial. I hope I have gone one degree further by not mentioning anything about the plot in such a way that will stimulate curiosity,",Null,0,1,8 October 2009
Midnight in Paris," A charmer from Woody
","On two things Woody Allen's admirers would agree, he is both a master entertainer and a director of considerable technical accomplishment. Most would also agree that his habit of producing one new work each year has led him into the pitfall of unevenness, a fault he shares with the French master, Claude Chabrol. But when it comes to identifying the highs and lows of his over prolific career, the disagreement starts. Is the 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan', 'Hannah and her Sisters' period really his best? I have personal reservations about these and, at the same time, I am aware that my own favourites are not always shared by others. For me 'Love and Death' is a comic masterpiece which manages to sustain a stream of gags without ever becoming stale on repeated viewings. 'Radio Days' achieves that sense of nostalgia for a place and time past that was the endearing quality of my favourite Fellini, 'Amarcord'. 'Everyone Says I Love You' is a simply gorgeous musical which takes the passing of a year framework adopted for 'Hannah' and improves on it. And what about the slyly wicked 'Match Point' with its echoes of Theodore Dreiser's 'An American Tragedy' - Woody at his darkest and, dare I say, finest. And then there are those moments particularly in his more recent career that get the critics saying excitedly that Woody is over his self obsessed doldrums and has regained something of his former brilliance. They said it with 'Melinda and Melinda' which I am afraid I found one great yawn. And now they are saying it again with 'Midnight in Paris' with perhaps rather more justification. This is a quite charming film in the Woody Allen canon, if, to my mind, a minor one. Not that it starts particularly promisingly. In 'Manhattan' the wonderful opening shots of New York accompanied by a swirl of Gershwin, somehow conveyed the director's total immersion in his love of a great city because they were so successfully subsumed into the context of the movie. A similar attempt to do the same with Paris with little more than a set of picture postcard shots is rather tame and conventional by comparison. Enter the American visitors with their endless yakking in restaurants, hotels and famous sites and I feared the worst, another one of Woody's conversation pieces going nowhere. But shortly into the film with the stroke of midnight and the sudden appearance of the 1920's car it all changes and we are in that world of fantasy that Woody does rather well. Remember 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' and his contribution to 'New York Stories'! Here the hero first stumbles into the world of the 20's and then into La Belle Epoque meeting up with an assortment of the great and famous, several of them rather good look-alikes. It's all enjoyable, clever stuff and if not quite one of his peaks, a reassurance that even with just over 40 films behind him, Woody still has the ability on occasions to delight and surprise.",Null,0,0,6 April 2012
North by Northwest," One that doesn't quite age well
","By general consensus Hitchcock reached the height of his powers from 'Strangers on a Train'(1951) to 'Marnie'(1964). Admittedly there were some splendid things before, 'The 39 Steps', 'Rebecca' and 'Shadow of a Doubt' among them, and not everything in the great period was among his finest. What to make of 'The Trouble with Harry' for instance! I have to admit that I don't share the universal admiration for 'Rear Window' which I find somewhat contrived - a sort of textbook exercise in exploring from a limited viewpoint, which I know to be its purpose but which I find just a little bit dull. As this could well be one of my cinematic blindspots I am willing to respect the views of its admirers. I am also rather lukewarm about 'North by Northwest' for reasons that I feel to be somewhat more valid. On first showing I found this to be a quite super thriller, witty, accomplished and stylish with some quite dazzling set pieces, not least the famous crop dusting sequence. But with each subsequent viewing my admiration has worn thinner. Again I feel it to be something of an exercise, an attempt to build a thriller out of all the successful ingredients of Hitchcock's earlier works. Thus, cliffhangers ('Saboteur', 'To Catch a Thief' and 'Vertigo'), cars driven at speed by drunken drivers ('Notorious'), talking oneself out of dangerous situations when trapped in public gatherings ('The 39 Steps' and 'Saboteur').....I could go on.....Only the agoraphobic scene of the crop dusting, the best scene in the film, breaks new ground. The rest is a rehash of things gone before, albeit quite entertaining until the longueurs of the penultimate scene at the spy's house by Mount Rushmore and the technically rather dubiously constructed sequence on the mount itself which never quite conveys the vertigo it should. This is Hitch's longest feature and after the two-hour point it rather feels it. I suppose that for me it boils down to the fact that he made very much the same film in 1935 - 'The 39 Steps'- lasting little more than half the time, so much better for its tremendous sense of pace and urgency. In 1956 he remade the 1934 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' taking nearly twice the time to tell the story. However on this occasion, he invested it with far greater depth of detail creating an infinitely more satisfying cinematic experience. Thus was Hitchcock forever unpredictable.",Null,1,5,24 September 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," It's a funny old world
","I was hardly surprised by the tirades of abuse heaped on this film by so many commentators.  The forcible eating of human excrement and the spectacle of depraved middle-aged men sodomising young people in full view of others are high on most people's taboos.  I could not help reflecting however what a funny old world this is as I emerged reeling from a cinema the other day having just been battered senseless by nearly three hours of violence in Martin Scorsese's 'Gangs of New York.  You won't find all the 'Disgusteds of Tunbridge Wells' flocking to user comments on the IMDb to record their protests at this marathon chunk of limb chopping, burning and impaling. It's all a matter of 'what's your poison?' I suppose and when you come down to it mutilation of the flesh seems generally more acceptable than buggery and s*** eating.  Not that 'Salo' does not have it all.  There are some pretty hideous tortures at the end but many will have walked out by then whereas the audience for Scorsese remained rooted to the end.  Although I would not take either film to my desert island, I have little hesitation in giving Pasolini my preference.  It is a very powerful parable about the nature of depravity and evil.  Had the orgies been toned down as Fellini was sometime wont to do in 'La Dolce Vita' and 'Satyricon', the powerful anti-Fascist message would have lost its ferocious force.  'Salo' is undoubtedly an uncomfortable experience, but in no way gratuitously obscene as so many have implied.",Null,0,4,24 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Phew!!!
","A Northern Ireland city on a damp Sunday morning is always among my most dispiriting overseas experiences.  Wander out into the streets and all you see are rows of shuttered and tightly bolted shops; no-one about apart from the solitary shuffling drunk.  Even the church bells don't wake up until later.  Nothing much to do except gaze expectantly at the multiplex billboard in the search for something to look forward to, come the afternoon.  I've failed in this place before, reduced to such cretinous concoctions as 'The Waterboy' and 'Waking Ned'.  Today doesn't look too promising either.  Something called 'The Matrix Reloaded' heads the list. I'm always suspicious of sequels as everyone tells you they're never as good as the original, but never having seen 'The Matrix' (Mark I) which is generally described as a great cult movie, I could be at an advantage of those ahead of me in the queue.  After all, as a great 'Psycho' fan, I have to admit that 'Psycho 2' was a good bit of fun.  I take the plunge and enter the noise cavern that is today's cinema.  Just over two hours later I have to say that I have had something of an experience.  I can't say exactly what except that is was a continuous onslaught on the senses that at times gave me something akin to pleasure.  I couldn't begin to tell you what it was about except that there were goodies and baddies battling it out in a future world that occasionally disconcerted with almost surreal elements of today - downtown city skyscapes and a tenement courtyard.  All I needed to do was to latch on to Keanu Reeves and girlfriend and hope they will make it through a labyrinth of dangers.  What really turned me on was all that Kung-Fu stuff, particularly two sequences; firstly where Reeves fights it out against an army of identikit men that had the brilliance of ballet at its best and then a fabulous battle on a busy city freeway the like of which for sheer 'perpetuum mobile' I have never seen before.  The fact that nearly everyone wears dark glasses that always stay on whatever they get up to I suppose is all part of the cult thing.  I have to confess to finding it all infinitely more enjoyable than the much hyped 'Crouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger' which seemed tame if not lame by comparison.  When I finally surfaced for air and reality Northern Ireland had come to life.  The street was full of Sunday afternoon shoppers.  It was all so normal and reassuring.",Null,0,0,14 June 2003
The Birds," The one indisputable Hitchcock masterpiece
","I have delayed commenting on a Hitchcock film for two reasons; first, so much has been written about them that I seriously wonder if there is anything more that can usefully be said and second, I am probably rare among movie buffs in not placing him at the top among the greatest of directors. That he is a marvellous entertainer and craftsman I would not deny;  indeed there are few other directors whose work I can return to again and again with such pleasure, but his films are all, with two exceptions, surface divertissements and some pretty wondrous at that -'Vertigo' and Psycho' for instance.  The ones I take really seriously are 'The Wrong Man', an intense study, almost documentary in style, of the ghastly consequences of mistaken identity and 'The Birds' which is so much more profound than anything else in the canon that I wonder if Hitchcock really was aware of the great gap between this and anything else he undertook.  As I feel so passionately about this work it is probably the one to write about.  Any serious discussion of 'The Birds' cannot commence without clearing away the problem of its widely misinterpreted genre.  Although I can appreciate that there are many with a bird phobia who can hardly bare to watch the film, I would insist that it is not a horror movie.  While every attempt is made to explain the behaviour of Norman Bates in Psycho ( a genuine horror film), the malevolent attacks by the birds on human beings remain a mystery to the end, creating an ambivalence that is more the stuff of the metaphysical than the horrific.  I see 'The Birds as an allegory on the way human beings prey on each other, demanding possession and affection often when it cannot be reciprocated, with the birds themselves surfacing every so often as a sort of Greek Chorus to externalise the inner clawing and tearing apart that humans often do to each other.  As the film has been analysed so many times I won't go into lengthy details, but simply record that it is the only Hitchcock film I would put in the top hundred of all time.  It says something profound about the human condition and was made by a craftsman, who, post 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho', had reached the very apex of his career.",10,1,1,28 June 2002
