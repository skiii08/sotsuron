The Longest Yard," Entertaining
","My son and I went to see this movie during our summer vacation. I had previously saw the earlier version but, could hardly remember it. I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, however, I feel he did a nice job in this movie.There were scenes that I felt were not plausible, however in the interest of making the movie entertaining, I felt they were necessary.The characters were diverse, and using Burt Reynolds in the remake is quirky fun. The large man in solitary confinement was especially silly and the process of bringing the team together was interesting.I would recommend this to young adult audiences with parent supervision. I will be in line to purchase the CD when it is released.",7,1,3,12 July 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Wow, what weird fun!
","I had the pleasure of taking two of my three children. My seventeen year old daughter loved it, however, my nine year old son didn't care for it. She is a HUGE Depp fan and thought he did an excellent job. I thought the special effects were unique and this movie was much more in line with the book. What I thought was interesting was that Dahl wrote the screenplay for the first movie - to me it was as though, he was trying to appeal to children on their level. Whereas, Burton told the story using flashbacks - for Wonka and this seemed to line up with the theory of psychoanalysis and film.I would highly recommend this movie to students who have previously read the book. It holds true to that medium and trying to compare it to the previous movie is like trying to compare a bicycle to an automobile.",8,5,8,17 July 2005
