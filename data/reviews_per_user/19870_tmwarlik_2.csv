The Blair Witch Project," A great film
","It can't believe all these folks who called this movie a 'bore'. This was horror in the true sense. It wasn't about some knife-wielding maniac jumping out of a closet giving the audience a cheap rush of adrenaline. This was a very cerebral film, one you have to have an imagination to enjoy. If you were expecting blood and guts, then you were at the wrong film. Go back to Blockbuster and rent Friday the 13th or some unintelligent piece of trash like that.",8,0,1,14 March 2000
Shrek," visually stunning, but a little gross
","'Shrek' is visually stunning. Dreamworks has really done a fantastic job with the computer animation. On the other hand I found some of the humor a little gross (is there no end to the flatulence jokes?!). I also have a hard time with many of the pop culture references. Although it may be humorous today, much of it will be meaningless in ten to fifteen years. I don't really see this film 'standing the test of time'.",5,0,3,29 May 2001
