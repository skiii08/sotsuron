Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Floppy eared Charlie Chaplin wannabe...
","Yes, I know that I'm going to sound like just another irate fan in the long list of negative critiques, but hey, I hide my disgust for no one. Yes, it IS as bad as you have doubtlessly heard. In fact, the only possible reason you might like this is if you have never seen the original trilogy.However, let me go on with my rant. I haven't bothered reviewing the original trilogy as I feel I have nothing to add. Some may the say the same about this, but I write it anyway, on the week before the Irish release of 'Clones' in the hope that Lucas will surprise me with the next offering. Here follows my bones of contention with 'Phantom Menace'.
The effects were very good, however I remain a fan of the more 'organic' school of film making, in the sense that Chewbecca was better because he had that 3D look- Jar Jar Binks remains strictly 2D (I hear that from now on, Yoda will be completely CG- Aaaaargh, Jim Henson must be turning in his grave!!). Also, on the subject of Binks..Yes, I hated his guts, and this, coming from someone who even liked the Ewoks for Christ's Sake!! I know that Lucas put him in because he wanted to appeal to younger viewers, as I'm sure was the reason for that woeful sequence in which Anakin flies around in space, shooting the bad guys (for some reason this sequence reminded me of a frenetic toy ad- I half expected a voiceover to announce 'now you too can fight the Empire with this tie-in computer game, only £29.99'- Ugh..). However, George, what about those who were around when the original came out in '77? They're not kids anymore, do you really want to alienate them? (I however must admit that I myself wasn't around in '77- though I was around for 'Jedi') I mean George, did you ever wonder why the darkest episode ('Empire') was also the most popular? Take the hint and get rid of that bloody floppy eared mutant Charlie Chaplin wannabe!!The acting was, for the most part, terribly wooden. I mean I've seen better acting on 'Fair City' (Irish readers will know what I'm talking about). People say 'Take it easy on Jake Lloyd, he's only a child,'- well I have three words for them: Haley Joel Osment. Lucas is notorious for casting people based on whether they look the part or not, let's hope he hasn't made the same mistake with Hayden Christensen. Portman was incredibly boring as the Queen, making us yearn for Fisher's feisty princess. In fact, most of the characters spent so much time pompously trying to look important and recite their lines with a straight face, that they didn't seem to be able to get much acting in. Also sorely missing is a cynical Han Solo-type character that the audience, particularly the uninitiated, can relate to.The first half hour was terrible- it seemed as if Lucas was shoving in as many locations as possible and didn't allow the story to leisurely unfold like it did in the earlier three. I mean George, you've got a great imagination, but bring back Irvin Kershner as director.PLEASE!Back to the effects. The podrace WAS breathtaking I'll admit, and Greg Proops was a nice touch. But the battle between the Gungans and the droids just looked like a scene from a computer game. Bring back people dressed up in rubber/plastic/furry suits, even if it means that the scenery has to be sacrificed!- Organic, please!!All in all, there were a couple of redeeming features in the film: The score (spot-on Williams); the banter between and initial meeting of R2D2 and C-3P0; Ian McDiarmaid as the Senator/ Emperor (nice bit o continuity there); Boss Nass (Kudos to Brian Blessed); the lightsaber duels which were excellent; Darth Maul, who unfortunately leaves us too soon; Liam Neeson and Pernilla August who tried to infuse the film with some humanity (sorry, Ewan mate, you were just too boring!); and last but not least, the expansion of our view of Tatooine.Naturally, no matter what they read, no Star Wars fan is going to boycott this film. Let's just hope that 'Clones' a better film will be..PS Great to see Bronagh Gallagher snagging a role, Go on the Irish!",Null,0,1,13 May 2002
Fight Club," The first rule is.WATCH THIS!!!
","A visually amazing update on the Jekyll and Hyde story, with a twist that will have you pressing rewind as soon as the closing credits start rolling (much in the same way as the Sixth Sense or Memento). Pitt, who, following Twelve monkeys and Se7en, is gradually endearing himself to me, gives a mesmerising performance as Tyler Durden, a dark, modern-day philosopher. Norton is even better as the monotone narrator, as is Bonham-Carter as Marla Singer, a FAAAR cry away from Merchant-Ivory; and Meatloaf is surprisingly good in a veeery bizarre role. Maybe it's the quick-fire editing, the incredibly dark humour (which is often very funny) or the dialogue that makes you think twice, but I just can't get enough of this movie. Forget any political, fascist or homosexual subtext, and accept this film for what it is: a unique blend of intelligence and entertainment. Mr Fincher, I salute you.However, when I watched this first of all in the cinema with a friend, she drew my attention to how violent it was; c'mon, I've seen a LOT worse. And hey, wouldn't we miss out on some great cinema if certain other movies that have 'inspired' infamous true-life acts of violence were never made: Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs etc. ? I rest my case.So, if you are squeamish, my advice is to find a friend who has already seen it to guide you through the violent parts, because if you are put off solely for that reason, then you would be missing a great movie. 9/10, deducting one for the utter confusion that reigned after I first saw it- repeat viewings clarify things!And ladies, for God's sake, don't just rent it out for 'Brad's abs', because there is a lot, lot more to this film than bloody well that!",Null,2,6,3 April 2002
Batman Returns," Holy Godfather II, Batman- a sequel that's better than the original!
","I adored this movie. Not only my favourite in the series, but also one of my all time favourite movies.. EVER!! I exaggerate, I hear you say? Mais non. The sets are spectacular, the performances are unforgettable, and the script is darker than the actors' dress code.The acting: First off, I was a little worried when I heard that Burton was casting Danny deVito as the Penguin, but I was wrong. DeVito, along with Burton's slight alterations to the Penguin's original physique (flippers, frequent BLACK nose bleeds), make the Penguin one of the scariest screen villains in a long time. There is, nevertheless, respectful reference made to Burgess Meredith's character in this Penguin's choice of attire during his mayoral campaign- monocle, cigarette-holder, top hat etc. As for the rest of the cast: Michelle Pfeiffer- WOW!; Keaton, on top form as always as both the moody millionaire and whispering-monotone superhero; and Walken, once again proving that he is king of the screen sociopaths.The script: With classic lines like 'I believe the word you're looking for is.AAAAAAARRGGHH!!!!', 'They wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so I'm layin' 'em on a slab!' and 'Life's a bitch, now so am I,' need I say more?The music: That one and only, born-to-score-Batman, Burton-mindreading legend, Danny Elfman. Sorry Elliot, but you're just no good at this kinda thing. Oh, and before I forget, Michelle Pfeiffer is WOW!I will admit that this is definitely not one for the kiddies (unlike Schumacher's crowd pleasing pap), but who the hell said that it was supposed to be?! Batman endured his time as a camp family-hero back in the 60's; now it's time for Burton to show us how he was meant to be (and this time, thankfully without the Prince songs), and, with his new feline adversary, endearing himself to S & M fans along the way no doubt.
Will Burton, Keaton and Elfman, like Batman, also Return? Let's hope so.P.S. Michelle Pfeiffer: WOW!",Null,0,0,3 April 2002
X-Men," Im sure someone else has already used this pun but, X-CELLENT!!
","A crackin good comic book adaptation. The cast was superb, Jackman a sensation, Janssen sexy, Park loadsa fun, Stewart inimitable, and McKellan giving his villain some class.I know that there were complaints about Rogue being too wimpy, but hopefully this is to highlight how she's going to grow more powerful in the next few films in the franchise. There were also complaints about the budget; me, I hardly noticed. I was just grateful that it wasn't swamped with special effects in the Star Wars: Episode One tradition, where, in certain scenes you might as well be watching Toy Story for all the human action taking place.I thought that each character was alotted enough time, and that the set pieces were expertly handled. The film was also made easily accessible to fans and newcomers alike, topped off with a great score by Michael Kamen. This, along with Fight Club, is also probably one of the most rewatchable films I have ever seen. Definitely one of the best comic book to big screen transistions since Mr. Burton's terrific job. Watch it now!",Null,0,0,31 March 2002
American Beauty," A good film, but unbelievably overrated.
","Yes, it was a good film, great performances, great script, great direction but hey, it wasn't THAT good! I've heard people lauding it as the next Citizen Kane, Mendes the next Welles but it isn't, he isn't! It's just--another--film.Bening,in particular, and the always reliable Spacey were great, and there were some great laughs from a drama like this, but I do think that the whole film was terribly overrated. As for it being the first mainstream arthouse movie'nope, Amelie is the first mainstream arthouse movie, THIS is just another American comedy-drama. I mean the whole message of there's beauty in everything, even dead birds and rubbish on a windy day. I just can't believe that the audience seemed to fall for that, such a cheesy message! In my opinion, it just gave the film an air of pretentiousness and superiority which put me off greatly- a 'look at all the beauty in the world that you haven't noticed before because it took this film to show you'-kind of message. However, the film was saved by all of the performances and some genuinely interesting characters so it is worth watching, just don't expect it to change your life.",Null,0,0,1 April 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Soderbergh Lite
","An okay movie, with too many twists and turns thrown in, seemingly for the hell of it. However, I was a little disappointed. No, Im not going to rant on like some eejits I've heard and say 'that was pretty far fetched', because I DO realise that it is ONLY A FILM; IT IS FICTION. Maybe that should set some people straight. No, instead I'll just say, how, like some others I naively believed that this would be as good as Out of Sight; George Clooney, Don Cheadle, music by David Holmes, and of course direction by the great Soderbergh himself. However, this film felt watered-down with most scenes too 'sitcom-friendly' for my liking. There were no great macabre moments like in the darker Out of Sight when White Boy Bob trips and shoots himself in the head. The laughs, for me, were instead very much 'popcorn laughs' (as in you only laugh because everyone else in the cinema is laughing). Garcia was a bit boring and non-threatening for my liking (he never showed any menace), and as for Roberts, well I've never been a fan, so OF COURSE I'd take the money instead! Cheadle's accent: It has to be said, why why why? They could have gotten anyone! Vas Blackwood from 'Lock Stock' or even Tricky(Fifth Element)- there are plenty of talented black cockney actor/rappers out there if that's what they were looking for!! What next? Brad Pitt as an Irishman? Oh wait...that's been done. Twice.On the other hand, there were clever bits (Cheadle watching the building demolition on television), the cast is charismatic, and the soundtrack undeniably cool. Bernie Mac and the 'Malloy Brothers' are especially a joy to watch.If you want something purely entertaining and non-demanding, then you wont be disappointed. Wait for the video though.",Null,0,1,30 March 2002
The Commitments," 'God sent him.' '-...On a f****n' suzuki?!'
","Well, there's not much else I can add to what's already been said. A great Irish film that shows that there's more to Ireland than the famine and green fields and the troubles in the north(although I'm not saying these aren't important,well maybe not the green fields). The cast is excellent, particularly Andrew Strong who still cracks me up with his facial expressions and, of course, Mickah 'dont f**k with me' Wallace with that memorable headbutt scene.The music is also superb, as are Jimmy Rabbitte's speeches about it; this film actually got me interested in 60's soul music. Although the economic situation in Ireland has improved a lot since 1991 (as, thankfully,has the fashion), the rest of the film hasn't dated one bit. All in all, an underrated masterpiece, even better than the book!",Null,1,2,29 March 2002
From Dusk Till Dawn," Gory fun
","Opinion is divided on this film amongst Tarantino fans (even though he didn't actually direct it). Most say 'Starts off well, but then gets crap'. Admittedly, the switch from crime movie to horror movie is far from seamless, but I have to say, I loved every minute of this. The horror is strictly of the gross-out carnage variety, and some may say it's too violent, but for me, the violence is a spoof, whether it was intended that way or not. It is a way of sticking two fingers up to the detractors of today's violent movies, much in the same way as Natural Born Killers (a film which I hated). I don't know how much of a role Tarantino played in the conception of the gore, but I personally see the second half of the film as satire, plain and simple. I mean, check out that tongue in cheek reference to John Carpenter on Scott's T-Shirt- in other words, 'think of the violence of the films of the 70s and 80s, and yet you say that 90s celluloid is too violent?!'Satire aside, I feel that the film does stand on its on two feet. The characters are entertaining and well drawn, right down to minor players such as the Sheriff and liquor store clerk in the opening five minutes, and all the performances are spot on. Comic relief is provided to a great extent by Cheech Marin(playing three parts), Tom 'sex machine' Savini, who I also believe is a makeup man (though apparently not for this film), and the fraternal bickering between Clooney and Tarantino, who are gold in the lead roles. The Fullers are also great, successfully portraying both a family unit and individual characters. Robert Rodriguez's direction is spot on, as in the popcorn actioner Desperado, and there's also a welcome appearance by Rodriguez regular Danny Trejo. The script is loaded (a befitting use of language if there ever was one) with great lines,most of them from other films, and the soundtrack is also excellent.Watch this now!- whether you love it or hate it, it's sure to leave a lasting impression on you.",Null,0,1,13 May 2002
Scream," What's the big fuss all about?! Just another OVERLY self-conscious movie
","After watching this film numerous times, I still can't figure out why it is hailed as one of the greatest horror movies of our time, or why its cleverness' is so eagerly acclaimed. I thought that the we're talking about horror movies within a horror movie' gimmick drastically ran out of steam after the first few references. From then on, it seemed a blatant case of Craven and Williamson saying 'we're not going to bother coming up with anything new, we're just going to make a point of saying Hey, we ACKNOWLEDGE that it's been done before so therefore you can't criticise us about it!'' And this feeling permeated the entire movie- Hey lads, you can't base a film solely on in-jokes & movie references. Oh yeah, and DO NOT drag the classic Halloween into this poor imitation- if you wanted to produce a truly scary, chilling movie, then just put up the money for Halloween to be re-released, or else rent out The Blair Witch Project to see how it should be done.The performances were nothing special, with only Lillard and Kennedy keeping the film afloat with their jokes, and, I don't know about the rest of you, but Marco Beltrami's musical effect that came on EVERY time a character reappeared into the frame annoyed the hell out of me!! The ending I found particularly poor: *SPOILER* I've seen less hemming and hawing about killing people in a James Bond movie, yet here the killers seemed so obviously uncoordinated that its a miracle they got away with it until now- I mean c'mon, even with a smidgen of common sense they would have surely killed Sidney and her father BEFORE stabbing themselves!! As for the identity of the killers, well yes, I wasn't expecting that, particularly the 2 killer twist. But hey, I doubt if ANYONE could've guessed that-- with the amount of red herrings that were given, I could've started a fecking fish farm!All in all, a bog standard horror flick that we have to blame for the I know-what-Urban Legend-you-told-last-Valentine's-in-Cherry-Falls H20' trend that followed, not to mention two pointless sequels. Only watch if u must, but don't expect it to live up to the hype.",Null,0,0,1 April 2002
