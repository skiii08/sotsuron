Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I hated it..
","This movie is terrible don't waste your money. My husband and I rented it thinking we would enjoy a good laugh together but we didn't. We turned this off before it was over both my husband and I hated it. I thought they missed the mark on most if not all jokes. I believe I chuckled twice. Most of the time my husband loves what I call 'dumb funny' movies but even he said let's turn this off. It was crude and not even funny crude. I was more uncomfortable than anything at how embarrassing this must be for everyone involved. I'm not a huge fan of crude humor so that that into consideration but enjoyed the crude funny found in movies like American Pie, 40 days and 40 nights, and even parts of Jack Ass but this was just stupid and not worth watching. What a waste of film.",1,10,21,24 April 2007
