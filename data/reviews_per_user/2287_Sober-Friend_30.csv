Blade Runner 2049," It Was 3 Hours Lon----------------g
",The limited plot makes this follow up to 'Blade Runner' seem endless. Now fanboys will thumbs down my review but I am correct. The film was too long for a plot that was razor thin. The same story could have been told had this filmed differently. The action moves slow and people seem to just go room to room in silence. Every scene starts in silence. In this film the Replicant's seem to know to pose a huge threat to mankind because they might be come life after all and thus eliminate the need for man! So goes the thinking of the people in charge. This film starts off with a discovery of bones that can be traced to Rachel. But what happened to her and Deckard? There is many theories why this film bomb. Mine is that the core fans of this film is over 40 and they hardly go to movies anymore. The running time is 3 Hours and that is too long for almost any film. The old film has a loyal following but it is small following. They are rabid but they are small in numbers.This film could have been better. If the pace of each scene was paced faster we would of gotten a much better film.,3,7,13,31 December 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the Best Movies of the 1980's
","This was the first Indiana Jones film. 'Raiders' was released in 1981. It sent the movie audience on an adventure that they never forgot.

Unfortunately, agents of Hitler are also after the Ark. Indy, and his ex-flame Marion, escape from various close scrapes in a quest that takes them from Nepal to Cairo.Never a dull moment. The film reaches a climax that you will never forget.",9,0,0,13 May 2017
Casablanca," A Perfect Film But Let's Clear Up A Few Rumors
","In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. 'Rick's Café Américain' attracts a varied clientele, including Vichy French and German officials, refugees desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of 'letters of transit' obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.Now let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about 'Casablanca' but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying 'The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting'. That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for 'things to change' while a film was in production. 'Casablanca was no exception! Another rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only 'thought of' but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast! Rumor #3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days. Another things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125+ minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.Now if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered. Today's filmmakers would not know how to make a film like this unless 'Batman' plays Ric!",10,20,21,25 March 2018
Memento," Stupid
","This film proves how stupid and how audiences have no attention span. I herd many people say they saw this 3 times before they understood the film. If they paid attention (Watch the movie and not look at your phone) then it would have been easier for some people to understand.In this film Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty, however, of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, form of memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why. Trust me this film has sold more aspirin than any other film. If you pay attention you will figure out this stupid movie. You will however get a migraine headache at the same time",4,1,4,22 September 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Fun Film
","Quentin Tarantino plays around with history and by doing so he created a great film. This is one of his best films he has made. Inglourious Basterds starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells the fictional alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's political leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish-American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel tracking down Raine's group who has a connection to Shosanna's past. The film's title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's macaroni combat film, The Inglorious Bastards (1978).This film however is a little long but still enjoyable",8,3,7,30 March 2017
"I, Tonya"," Fun Film
",Tonya Harding rises through the ranks of competitive figure skating only to find disgrace when her husband tries to eliminate her rival.This film is cleverly done. It is done as a dark comedy like 'The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom' and 'To Die For'. What both films did was take a comic look at a true life event. 'I Tonya' is cut from the same cloth. The acting in this film is great but Allison Janney is sorely missed when she is not on the screen.,8,8,15,31 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Almost as Stupid as The Phantom Menace
",This film is almost the same plot as 'A New Hope'. This time however Luke is now a Jedi and he must confront his father and help the Rebles once and for all destroy the Empire. Now I loved this film when I first saw it in 1983. In like 'Star Wars' and 'Empire' this film is not holding up. It has great moments but the Care Bear Ewok creatures are annoying for most of the time they are on the screen. There is a few moments that they are fine but most of the time they are just as annoying things that are just silent versions of Jar Jar Binks. Now as I prefer the original version of the film for many reasons. The fixes in this are minimal. The best fix was the dessert creature no longer looks like a giant vagina,7,0,1,12 February 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Great Film
","With Disney Buying Fox its going to be the end of films like this. That's sad because in 40 years people will still be talking about this film but will they still be talking about 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5'? I Doubt it. In this film a woman's daughter was murdered. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby, the town's revered chief of police.Tensions run high and the suspects are all over the place. To give more away would be a crime. Trust me this film is original. Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, & Sam Rockwell prove once again that they are three of the best actors working today. Frances & Sam should make room on their trophy case! What a wonderful film.",9,6,13,22 January 2018
Grease," A Classic Film That Almost Everyone Loves
","In 1978 Hollywood seem to be the best year of produced movies since in 1939. Many films in 1978 became templates for their genres that later other films copied. Films released in 1978 include 'Animal House', 'Magic', 'The Boys from Brazil', 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Superman: The Movie', 'Heaven Can Wait', 'Foul Play', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', 'Every Witch Way But Loose' 'Halloween' and 'Grease'. All the above films still are still popular. They all sell millions of dollars worth of DVD Sales each year. 'Grease' of course out sells them all. In case you didn't know the story 'Grease' is the story of 'Danny and Sandy'. They are both crazy for each other and yet they are polar opposites. The catchy score has now produced classic tunes. If you missed out on the original theatrical release that is sad. The film had such a high energy level that you left the movie theater wanting to sing. The major criticism about the film was that 'They all looked too old to still be in high school'. Well that is true but I would rather see talented performers playing roles than untalented age apposite actors. This film is family safe but today the film would be rated PG-13. There is some very adult jokes in the film but, it will go over most children's head (and some adults). My complaint about the film is that it has never had a great Blu- release. Yes there has been releases that had 'Deleted scenes' but not all of them. There is still plenty of deleted footage that has never been released and I would love to see them. I would also love to see a documentary that explores the making of the film. There has been one done and released but it wasn't interesting.",8,1,1,10 April 2017
Footloose," Time Has Not Been Kind To This
","I saw 'Footloose' in the theaters in 1984. I was in high school and enjoyed. However in the years since its been released it has left a huge imprint on America. It is easy to understand why. The film itself had a huge best selling soundtrack album that not only included the title song but also classic tunes 'Let's Hear it for the boy' and the often covered 'Holding on for A Hero'. People love this film however those who love this need to see it again. Time has not been kind. Even though the Crazy Right WIng Jerks seem to be taken over the United States today in 2017 they also had a grip on the United States in 1984 'The Reagan Era'. In this film a teen moves to town with his mom and they live with her brother. The town seems to be ran by a jerk who is not the mayor but a Preacher on a Bully pulpit. The adults act like drones. They think the preacher was right in outlawing 'Dancing' and 'Liquor'. Well all of that gets tested when Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves into town and decides to challenge everything that is banned.The film itself has great moments but on the whole (but even in 1984) the film is campy. Today the camp is now dated but the crazy. Keven Bacon and Lori Singer are good but the film scenes with the Reverend drag this film down! IT makes it boring. In the remake they should have had Ren of the Reverends daughter shoot him! In real life the Crazy Christians seems to have multiplied across the United States. I am sure if they read this review they will vote NO about this review being helpful, Well they can suck it!",6,1,6,27 May 2017
Split," M. Night Shyamalan Is still a one trick pony
","M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999. His follow up films have been not just been huge disappoints but truly some of the worse films I had to sit through. 'Unbreakable' was just stupid and so was 'Signs' and 'The Village'. I did not even bother to watch 'The Lady in the Water' and other celluloid manure he created. So last night against my better judgment I saw 'Split' which was just an exercise in patience. M. Night Shyamalan proves he likes to not only bore his audience but he also loves steel money from studios that still will back his films.In this film M. Night Shyamalan had an interesting gem of an idea about a crazy man who kidnaps 3 girls. The Three teenagers, Claire, Marcia, and outsider Casey, are kidnapped and held captive by 'Dennis', one of 23 personalities present in the mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb, a victim of childhood abuse diagnosed with identity disorder. The film however fails to engage the audience. A few scenes work but they are out numbered by the scenes that don't. The film of course has a 'Minor' twist at the end but its more like a winks to the audience for fans of one of the directors other films. A much better film that dealt with split personalities is 'Raising Cain' and 'Sisters'. It least those films were done by craftsmen that knew how to engage an audience. He still has lots of fan who will hate this review. That's too bad that they will thumbs down this review when in fact they know this film is awful. They need to get a life",1,51,123,25 April 2017
The Exorcist," No the Devil Didn't Win
",There is 2 Versions of this film. I prefer we the 2nd version which was subtitled 'The Version You Have Never Seen'. The writer of 'The Exorcist' (William Peter Blatty) Hated the Theatrical release of 'The Exorcist'. He did not talk to the director (William Friedkin) for years. The reason for the dispute was that Blatty thought that Friedkin cut too many scenes out of the film and made it look like 'Evil Had One'. For years on talk shows and public speaking tours Mr Blatty had to defend the film because many people though 'Evil WOn Out'. Finally after 20+year of pleading William Friedkin re-edited the film to include scenes that Blatty thought was needed. After he re-edited the film Director William Friedkin) agreed that Blatty had been right for all these years. The Re-edited Version is called 'The Version You've Never Seen' and it is better but only slightly. Many people thought in the original version that 'The Devil Won'. This proves to me most people are stupid. If you look at the original ending the Priest Sacrifices Himself to save the girl. The Exorcism didn't work but the devil didn't win.This film is still very scary. If you never seen it then please watch it but keep small children out of the room. Suitable for 12 on Up,10,3,5,12 July 2017
Flashdance," A Culture Phenomenon
",Watching this film screams 1980's. However this film to me is just as entertaining now as when it was first released in 1983. Alex is a welder by day and dancer by night. Her dream is to be able to enter a dance academy but she is afraid of not only getting in but even applying freaks her out. Alex at times is very mature for her age but at times she acts very immature. The dance sequences in this film along with a great characters and great original soundtrack made this film a huge hit.I am shocked that this film never got a sequel. Even more shocking is hasn't ( as of 2018) there has not been a remake.,8,2,2,1 April 2018
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Gets Better with Age
","When this film was released in 1993 Disney Distant themselves from this. They removed the 'Walt Disney' presents from the credits and released it under their TOUCHSTONE picture label. The reality is they had no idea that they had one of the best films the studio has ever released. Tim Burton was the executive producer of this film. He came up with the idea. However in 1992 he released 'Batman Returns' and that film got major backlash for the dark tone it had/ 'The Night Before Christmas' has a dark tone to it but it is very very funny. Most of all it has the best original scores to ever be made for a film. In this film Halloween Town, is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington ('The Pumpkin King') leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to 'Christmas Town.' Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his (somewhat limited) understanding of the festivities to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Things go wrong very fast when Jack start delivering his idea of Christmas Toys. After the film was released on Home Video the film really started to gained a foothold on audiences. Once they saw it 'They loved it'. Then Disney finally put there name on the film after the film became such an icon of not only 'Halloween' but 'Christmas' as well. The film is so well made and it is never boring. The songs in this film are very catchy. Not exactly a huge hit when it was released in 1993 the film however has gone on to be a best seller on home video every year!",8,3,3,25 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Fans will hate my review
","'Star Wars' fans will never admit when a film is terrible. They will still defend 'The Phantom Menace' and they will also defend this film. Now 'The Last Jedi' is not as bad as 'The Phantom Menace' but its not 'Much Better'.This film was going to take a dark turn. The 'Middle Film' in all the 'Star Wars' films always do this. This film however goes very dark and there is no 'Joy' at all in this film. Its like Bergman directed this. The story is also padded to 2 1/2 hours. Most of the scenes should of had the action play faster.In this film Luke Skywalker's peaceful and solitary existence gets upended when he encounters Rey, a young woman who shows strong signs of the Force. Her desire to learn the ways of the Jedi forces Luke to make a decision that changes their lives forever. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren and General Hux lead the First Order in an all-out assault against Leia and the Resistance for supremacy of the galaxy. Unexpected coupling happens here and I miss seeing Rey and Finn together. They made 'The Force Awakens' great. Here Finn almost has nothing to do.

The Last Emperor," Not very good
","This sweeping account of the life of Pu Yi (John Lone), the last emperor of China, follows the leader's tumultuous reign. After being captured by the Red Army as a war criminal in 1950, Pu Yi recalls his childhood from prison. He remembers his lavish youth in the Forbidden City, where he was afforded every luxury but unfortunately sheltered from the outside world and complex political situation surrounding him. As revolution sweeps through China, the world Pu Yi knew is dramatically upended.This is a by-the-numbers movie when comes to making a film that will most likely get you the major awards. If you like this film then check out the even longer version!If you want a Big Movie event to see then Watch 'Lawerence of Arabia'. There is several elements from that film that the director stole from.If you you cant find anything else to watch on TV read a book! Call a friend! Clean your closet! Plan your future! Dust! Do laundry! Clean the cat box! Clean your trash cans! Scrub the toilet! Check your smoke alarms! Call your mother. Washing out the garbage cans is more entertaining! Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!",4,0,5,2 April 2017
Singin' in the Rain," A Classic
","Last year I was very lucky to catch this on the big screen. This film is meant to be seen on the big screen! It was also the first time I saw it at the theaters and I was very impressed with the visuals.In this film movies are switching over from being silent to being 'talkies'. However the film is a spoof of the turmoil that afflicted the movie industry in the late 1920s when movies when the change over went from silent to sound. When two silent movie stars', Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, latest movie is made into a musical a chorus girl is brought in to dub Lina's speaking and singing. Don is on top of the world until Lina finds out.This is such a great film that if you ever get the chance to see this at the movies then DO IT.Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds made an awesome team.",9,20,21,22 January 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Not a Fan
","Years ago I saw a coming attraction for the 'Disney Cartoon' of 'Beauty and the Beast'. I was floored. The song was 'Belle'. It was catchy. I couldn't wait to see this film. I took my niece and nephew. After I watched it I couldn't wait to see it again. I loved the film. I wasn't the only person who loved the film. The 1991 feature was the first Animated Film to ever be Nominated for Best Picture. It was the first to Animated Film gross over $100,000,000 at the domestic Box Office. About 3 years Disney had a Broadway adaption. I thought it was terrible. Nothing original about it. All they seem to so was transfer the film to stage without much imagination. Now in 2017 we get the live action musical 'Beauty and the Beast'. Yes it was a huge box office success but doesn't mean its a good film. Far from it.The story here is almost the same. The new songs stick out. They are just as bad as the changes George Lucas made in his 'Star Wars' film. The casting in this film is okay but Emma Watson is obviously auto- tuned. Her voice is very average. That is too bad. The producers should have cast Ann Hathaway or Emmy Rossum. Both have much stronger voices.As for this film adaption? It suffers from bad camera angles during the final act and storming of the castle. If you have never seen the animated film then you will love this. If you have then you will be disappointed.",6,0,1,1 July 2017
The Godfather: Part III," Worth Watching Once
",After 26 years people were waiting for another 'Godfather' film. In Late 1988 people were celebrating that the Saga of The Corleone was to continue when Paramount Pictures Announced 'The Godfather Part III' was coming in 1990. Now when 'The Godfather Part 2' was released at first that was a head scratchier for many people because the film was told in two different time periods. It was the rise of the the father (Told in flashbacks) and the fall of the son. Then the reviews turned around quickly and :The Godfather Part 2' went on to win Best Picture of the year just like its predecessor. When Francis Ford Coppola decided to make 'The Godfather II' he told this story in much different way as he did the other two films however this time he failed. However the casting of Sofia Coppola wan't the films on flaw. The story itself is confusing and not well told. Another Problem is the character of Michael Corleone. By the time 'The Godfather II' he was cold & alone. In this film he is trying to redeem himself. The other story is about the Vatican bank. This is really poorly told. I am sure most of the audience could not really tell you what really happened! By the end of the movie nobody could tell you what exactly what the story was and what was the point? A major problem also with the film is that of Connie. She has new become vicious! It was established at the end of 'Godfather II' that she was now 'Taking Care' of her brother. This film would of have been more better served if Connie had orchestrated the assassination of her brother Michael. After all he ordered her husbands death and their own brother. Her seeking revenge would of been a better story. What we got here was a huge mess. If you loved the first two movies you will want to see this but you will be very disappointed!,4,4,7,1 August 2017
Jaws," Will Make You Stay Out of the Water
",This 1975 has changed movies forever but going to the beach as well! 'Jaws' was Steven Spielberg's first monster hit. Out of all the films he has made this to me is still his best work. In this film a young woman is attacked and killed by a shark. When the local people get mad when the Sheriff wants to close the beaches so they can locate and kill the shark the sheriff gets overridden but the towns mayor. Later on the 4th of July there is another attack and the film becomes a showdown between man and beast!,8,0,1,22 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best One of the New Trilogy
",This 2005 film is the best of the newer trilogy. However it still has major flaws and a paper thin story. The actors can not compensate for a story that really is razor thin.If you see the film 'Rouge One' you will understand that film should of been this film. It would have been more entertain had this film focused on the building of the 'Death Star'. It also would have been great to see a better way the Anakin turn to the 'Dark Side'George Lucas is a good director of special effects but directing people is not for him. Hayden Christensen however is miscast and so wooden in this that you don't care that he is almost burned alive. Natalie Portman however does not come across any better but most of us knew she is a very good actress however you would never know it if you only saw her in this. The one bright note is that Jar Jar Binks only has a 1 second cameo in this.,6,7,12,6 May 2017
Halloween," Not for today's Brain Dead Teens
",This film has a low body count. It builds on the terror between the kills. The film is almost bloodless but everyone thinks its a blood bath! It is a classic film! It ushered in a new type of horror and movies have never been the same.John Carpenter and Debra Hill's screen play is a lean mean terror machine! In case you did not know the story in a nutshellIn 1963 a 6 year old boy stabs to death his older sister. 15 years later he breaks out of the mental hospital and returns to his hometown to begin anew! This film will be 'slow and boring' to most teen today because they have the attention span of a fly. They also will not look closely at was is going in the background in this film and that is sad. To me seeing what is going on in the background is what gives this film its iconic status!This film is a classic. The success of this film ushered in the slasher films of the 1970's and 1980's. If it wasn't for the success of 'Halloween' there would of never been a 'Friday the 13th' Film or 'Nightmare on Elm St'.This film is flat out frighting. What scared me here is the fact most of us at one time felt someone was watching us. This movie plays on that fear. However hardly anybody in the film realizes they are being watched by an escaped mental patient. The widescreen frame adds scares because John Carpenter will show the killer (the shape aka Michael Myers) in the frame but then he is gone and you don't know where he is. Now anybody under 30 will find this film slow because there isn't a kill every 5 minutes. What we have is a slow build up of terror and the past 15 minutes of this film will have you screaming for mercy! Again today's teens have a limited attention span and will find this film a bore. However these are the same teens that named 'Twilight' best picture of the year.,10,11,16,9 July 2016
Carrie," Holds Up
","Mousy teen Carrie White may be ostracized, but she has the ability to move objects with her mind. When the high school 'in crowd' torments her with a sick joke at the prom, she lashes out with devastating and deadly power.This film is so well made that Hollywood should never ever had remade this. The actors in this are as good as it gets. It also has a vibe that could never be duplicated. Both Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek landed Academy Award nominations. The film has one memorable scene after another. Don't watch it alone!!",8,1,1,29 April 2018
Blade Runner," Adding My Voice to a Loud Chorus
",I was 15 when the film was released in 1982. I remember Gary Franklin (A Movie Critic on Television) gave this film a '10' on a scale of 1 to 10 '10' being best. When a friend of mine saw this he hated it and so I never saw until 1992. That is when the 'Director's Cut' was released theatrically. I was now 25 years. I wanted to see this because I saw a clip on television and someone saying this film was meant to be seen on the 'Big Screen' and so off I went. This cut of the film is most well known for being the version that 'Took Away' the Harrison Ford Voice Overs. It also included a shot of a unicorn that implied that 'Harrison Ford' is a Replicant. I was not blown away by this film. I thought it was 'good' not 'great'The story does take its time but the rewards are huge if you pay close attention. . Its haunting images are so memorable that it influenced future filmmakers. In more ways than one it became the 'Metropolis' of a new era. From the future setting to having different versions released. 'Blade Runner' and 'Metropolis' are 2 films one should watch back to back. Now my problem with 'Blade Runner' is that each version is SLOW! The action could of moved faster. The story is very thin. Ridley Scott film is like an old man trophy wife. Pretty to look at but has almost nothing to offer!,7,24,35,13 May 2017
The Greatest Showman," WOW A GREAT FILM
","Inspired by the imagination of P. T. Barnum, The Greatest Showman is an original musical that celebrates the birth of show business & tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.There is such a beauty to this film. It is a metaphor for 'The American Dream' but most of all it is a story about love and making of a family,I did not think I would like this film. I never wanted to see this, What I got was a thrill ride and an emotional experience I never expected. The film is a glimmer of hope that 'Hollywood' can still be creative. It was my pleasure watching every frame of the film!",9,2,5,23 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Review of the Original Theatrical Edition
","The 1970's is most likely the best decade of films released. Films that were released in that decade set the templates of most film genres. 'Superman', 'Animal House', 'Grease' 'Halloween', 'The Exorcist', 'Jaws', 'Halloween', 'The Omen' and most importantly 'Star Wars'. Those films are just the tip of the iceberg. In 1977 there was little fanfare about this film coming from George Lucas. The studio (Fox) though their big release that year was going to be 'The Other Side of Midnight'.'Star Wars' however was an over budgeted film that Fox did not put much marketing behind (At First). This film however was the first film ever promoted at 'Comic Con' and that help spread the word that this film was coming. From the first moments on the screen to the closing frames the film the film was a huge feast for the senses. In a nutshell the story is about Rebels trying to destroy 'The Empire'. They control everything in the universe and basically everyone lives in fear of them. The main weapon of 'The Empire' is the death star. The weapon can destroy a planet. THe Rebels have stolen the plans of the death star and have given them to Princess Leia. The Empire has now captured Princess Leia. Before she was captured she hide the stolen plans in R2d2. She has now sent R2D2 on his own mission to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi who she thinks they can help destroy not only 'The Death Star' but 'The Empire' as well.The film is one of the greatest. If you have never seen it on a big screen then you should. This film is always entertaining. It doesn't matter how many times you have watched it!If you can watch the the original theatrical edition. The 1997 Special Edition is fine but the tweaks George Lucas did to it really irk us nerds that feel in love with the original version. Carrie Fisher you will be missed but you will never be forgotten!",9,3,7,13 April 2017
Footloose," Julianne Hough is just as Bad as Jessica ALba
",This film could have been an improvement on the campy original. However it failed once they cast Julianne Hough. She can dance but she can not act.Sticking closely to the original the film changes Ren from having a mother to being an Orphan. The wreck that was talked about in the original is shown here.Denis Quaid is not a good choice to laying the preacher. In real life he is known for being a huge drunk with stints in rehab. His own persona overwhelms his part here. In general this film was just bad from the idea of it to the casting. Julianne Hough needs to take acting classes.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Well it is worth Watching
",The 'Indiana Jones' films varies. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is one of the best films of the 1980's. It was #1 Box Office Hit of the Year! IT went on to be nominated for Best Picture and Director however those prizes escaped the film and filmmakers. 3 year later we got the sequel 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' which is one the worst sequels ever made. So 5 years of 'Temple of Dome' we got 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' which was a vast improvement over 'Temple of Doom'.This go around is also a little bit of an origin's story. The filmmakers were also very wise to add Sean Connery to the cast. He plays the father of Indiana Jones. Now the story is not that hard to follow but the film suffers from sequel fatigue. The film runs over 2 hours and at the final climax is almost a letdown!,7,1,1,18 July 2016
Alien: Covenant," Ridley Scott Go Away
",Just like Steven Spielberg Ridley Scott can no longer make decent and entertaining film. Steven Ruined all future 'Indiana Jones' with 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls' Ridley Scott has ruined 'Alien' because he ruined 'Alien' with 'Prometheus' and 'Alien Covenant'. 'Covenant' adds nothing knew. It starts off boring and stays that way. the only thing different about this film is the fact that there is a homo erotic scene that the others never had. JJ Abrams needs to come along and save 'Alien'. Ridley is an old fart who makes long and boring films. He should retire. If you watch this film you will see why!,6,0,5,27 June 2017
Up in the Air," One Scene Cost This Film Major Awards
","This is a well made movie. It was released in 2009 during the start of the great rescission.In this movie an idea from a young, new co-worker (Anna Kendrick) would put an end to the constant travel of corporate hatchet man Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), so he takes her on a tour to demonstrate the importance of face-to-face meetings with those they must fire. While mentoring his colleague, he arranges hookups with another frequent-flier (Vera Farmiga), and his developing feelings for the woman prompt him to see others in a new light.There is a scene near the end that is not needed. Its a scene in the car with George Clooney on the phone. Its overkill and I think that is what caused this film to lose out on major awards.",7,0,0,22 February 2019
