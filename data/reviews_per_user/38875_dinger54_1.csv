The Ring," get to the movie theatre now!!
","Don't read about this film anymore-if you have not seen this movie yet-get out some money, get your car keys, and get down to the theatre....and make sure you visit the restroom BEFORE you see this movie.  It seems to me that scary movies just don't exist anymore-people make good attempts, but nothing really plays with our minds anymore.  This movie actually had me scared both physically and mentally.  It was like i could not move or anything.  I just got back from the theatre and i have to say that i am still scared-ya i don't think I'm going to fall asleep anytime soon.  I would love to make all kinds of comments, but the best thing for you to do is watch it yourself and be your own judge.  I don't think I have ever been affected by a movie like this-i mean there are part of the movie that are still running through my mind and I am really tense right now.  I know some of you will read this and say, 'that movie wasn't scary,' but am spooked and my two friends both agreed that is was scary throughout.  I give it 10 out of 10-so go see it!",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
