Iron Man 3," Didn't like it.
","I am a huge super hero movie fan. I loved the Avengers, brilliant. This movie was very disappointing. To begin with, the trailers and posters were quite deceptive. I expected so much more. I like the idea of Tony suffering mentally from the events of the Avengers but this film did not explore them very well. Probably the most disappointing parts of the film was the Mandarin and the extremis virus. Very poorly done. The Mandarin is a fantastic character and enemy of Ironman. To say they wrecked things in this movie would be an understatement. Ben Kingsley was brilliant as was Guy Pearce. I anticipated Guy Pearce's role to be much smaller but he was almost all through the movie. He is very good.There is the expected comic relief from the Marvel movies and I laughed hard at times. Robert Downey Jr has excellent comedic timing and delivery. I wish those responsible for this film didn't take so much license in interpreting the Ironman story. I think they may have wrecked it. I don't see how there can possibly be an Ironman character in future movies, be that Avengers part 2 or Ironman 4 etc despite the closing credits stating Tony Stark will return. He will probably return, just not as Ironman.Marvel, I am unhappy. Please redeem yourselves with a brilliant Avengers 2.",4,15,30,27 April 2013
