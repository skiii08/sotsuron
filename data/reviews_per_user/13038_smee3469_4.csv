The Blair Witch Project," don't watch this alone!
","I haven't been this freaked out since 'the Exorcist'... no, scratch that. This is BETTER than 'The Exorcist'... watch with a bunch people, turn your phone off, and lock the door.",7,1,2,11 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," DON'T READ THIS COMMENT UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!
","Although 'The Phantom Menace' was a great experience to see on screen, with 600 other people all equally excited to see the film, it doesn't nearly live up to 'A New Hope'.  Which is why one should go into this film with NO expectations.  If you go in, thinking it's not going to be very good, it won't be.  If you go in expecting 'A New Hope', you'll be disappointed. So just go in with NO expectations, and it'll be fun.  There were some GREAT aspects to the film, as there were equally particularly bad aspects.  The greatest part about the film was Darth Maul.  Great to watch, and just had SO much stage presence.  But the worst character was the all-CGI Jar Jar Binks.  Most annoying (and painful) character to watch on-screen.  Half the time you don't understand what he's saying, and when you do understand, it's not funny.  And the CGI-element was like watching a really bad version of Roger Rabbit (interacting with live-action).  The fight sequences were great (due, once again, to Darth Maul), and the race sequence with Anakin was a blast.  But the plethora of cameos (from Samuel L. Jackson to the guy who played 'Willow') was a bit distracting at times.  It wasn't the same as watching actors you've never seen on screen before delivering great one-liners and interacting with each other.  The effects were cool (epitome of 'eye candy'), and overall a fun film to watch to go along with the ride. Especially if you're really familiar with the intricate storylines, and how they will develop (from Amidala and Anakin to the rise of Senator Palpatine).  See in a big crowded theatre with a big bunch of fanatics, and let your brain go.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
American Pie," Not A Date Movie!!
","Truly a great movie, but don't see it with a date (VERY uncomfortable at times)... Reminds you of High School sexual politics, and just how worked up you'd get about your prom night ;-)",7,0,0,11 May 1999
Shrek," A GREAT parody
","I wasn't sure, going into this film, if it was going to be some sort of 'poor-man's Toy Story' (considering this is Dreamwork's computer animated division, ala Disney's Pixar), but was in for a pleasant surprise. This film is a degree more adult, in terms of humor, than Disney animated films, and in a good way. I don't think younger children will totally understand it, but this a film that adults will enjoy. *Watch for the interrogation scene with the gingerbread man; it's GOLD!*",8,2,2,14 April 2001
