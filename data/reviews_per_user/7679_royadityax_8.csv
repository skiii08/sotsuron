Angels & Demons," must watch.... Some say the book is better. But its a great film
","It's a thriller based on a novel by Dan Brown directed by Ron Howard. As the story is of Brown there's no need of mentioning how great it is. The best thing about Dan's stories is that they make extensive use of interesting historical data, dire true facts. There is another signature style of his novels and therefore the movies based on them, they have two climaxes. All it needed was a proper script and that has been brilliantly prepared by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman. This good piece of work by Ron gives a beautiful experience and it is elevated by the amazing violin Ã°Å¸Å½Â» solos by Joshua Bell.... Definitely #mustWatch....",8,0,1,17 April 2015
The Others," A Thriller with Drama and Thrills....
","This is a supernatural thriller with a plot uncommon in this section.... The plot being the chief attraction the thrill is very well maintained. The protagonist is a mother who has two small kids - a daughter and a younger son. Her husband is out fighting in the war. So she is all alone in her huge house with her photosensitive children. In the meantime three mysterious servants arrive. She has to manage the household stuff, take care of her kids and bear the unusual happenings taking place in the house. We get to see everything through the eyes of the lady- her anxiety, terror, fear, care for her children and loneliness. We get suspicious of everybody we see and wait for a twist, a climax. It does come when we expect it to but only prove our predictions to be wrong. The husband pays a visit in the middle of the film but simply throws us into more confusions.... Nicole Kidman simply rocked her role. The actors have performed very well too... The down sides are the behind the age music. Though the movie is set in the past century. Moreover it does get a bit monotonous as we can't make out anything in the second quarter.... #mustWatch....",8,0,1,7 May 2015
Forrest Gump," An amazing sweet story of a stupid man....
","Watched Forrest Gump .... It's beautiful. It's just amazing. A concept very few movies have successfully stood up to....It's the story of a stupid person named Forrest Gump. But its not just a stupid comedy to be laughed at and forgotten. It makes you see the world through the eyes of the stupid completely innocent Forrest. You see death, the evils of war, corruption, jealousy, self righteousness, greed, wealth, frustration, success and the world. But you see all of it almost without reaction. Cause you see all of these through Gump's eyes, through the eyes of a stupid man child and his brain doesn't work like me and you, he is different.... That's what makes the movie so special....Ã°Å¸ËÅ  Talking about other stuff, they keep everything simple, no special effects nothing. Just plain old good music at the right time.... And I must say Tom Hanks just nailed it....This is definitely a #mustWatch for people of every age group.... At you in love? I suggest you watch it with her. No it's not a romantic drama....",10,4,6,9 February 2016
The Theory of Everything," the life but not the mind....
","Watched #TheTheoryOfEverything....The movie is a biography about the life of Steven Hawkins. The movie does tell a lot unknown stuff about Steven....The Steven here performs his role very well. The expressions, body language, ways of talking does remind us of the real Steven Hawkins. The screenplay is really good and so is the story telling. His personal life comes into illumination and very few of us have knowledge of his life. His struggle, overcoming the struggle and the emotional tug of war has been expressed beautifully....On the other hand, the chief disappointment is that we don't get much taste of Hawkins's genius. There ain't much over the head scientific talks or Steven's confusions confusing us. Whatever idea he talks about is quite easy to understand....Well, we don't have much knowledge the life of this genius and this motion picture helps pretty good in this direction.... #mustWatch....",7,2,3,6 July 2015
Gran Torino," Simple but Perfect...,
","Watched #GranTorino....The name of the movie is from a vintage car Gran Torino 1972 of the old Mr. Walt Kawauski. The car does play an important role in the common man movie. Walt is an ex militant who fought in Korea. He is a very interesting person, a solitary, hate-people, angry old man.... I saw myself in him.... He eventually turns out to be the neighbourhood hero. Watch the movie to find out how....To some up, the movie is perfect in what it is. The characterisation is amazing. The situation is very practical. The scenes are perfect. The story is simple but the brilliant screenplay makes it extraordinary. The film is pretty simple stuff, but you won't be able to complain about anything in it. It's foolproof....#mustWatch....",9,1,6,1 July 2015
Evil Dead," One of the best in its common category....
","Firstly lemme say what it about is. As the name suggests, it's a supernatural horror film not suitable for kids and week hearts. In it a group of four friends and a girl who is one their sisters. The go to an old house of David and her sister Mia in the middle of the woods far away from civilization. What they wanna do is help Mia with her rehab and make sure that she doesn't escape this time. In the mean while they discover weird stuff in the house and an Evil Book of summoning demons. One of the friends out of curiosity read out a passage from the book and summon an evil entity which starts killing them one by one so as to come to earth from hell with its full power. Of course they somehow stop it. Watch the movie to know how.How the movie is?.... Well it's one of the best supernatural horror movies I have ever seen. Brilliant effects of all sorts, trust worthy acting, satisfying logic and proper ending. And most importantly, it has what we search in horror movies- gore, adrenaline rush, suspense and thrill without the feeling that we are watching stupid stuff.The down sides are only that it does have some common elements and goofs. Lemme mention two of the goofs I'm sure you missed. 1. The necklace Mia wears towards the ending was torn down by herself previously in the movie. 2. Mia never closes the cap of the fuel tank of the chain-saw, in fact she drops the cap and never picks it up.. But in the next scene you see it closed.",8,0,4,8 December 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," it's one of a kind horror thriller and a #mustWatch....
","Watched #TheCabinInTheWoods....It's about 5 friends who go to the woods where Curt's cousin has bought. But weird things start to happen....That doesn't feel awkward because you will be expecting it but what feels weird is that the doesn't keep much secrets. A lot of stuff most movies would save for the suspense is given out casually. Even after all these there are some twists and suspenses you will never be expecting....Lemme tell you, it ain't like any other horror thriller you have seen....It's just one of a kind and a #mustWatch....",8,1,4,10 July 2015
V for Vendetta," Very good.... Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici....
","Watched #VforVendetta....Very good indeed.... I didn't know about this DC comics character. He is very interesting indeed. There is something very different about this moVie. Like most Verified moVies based on comic chAracters, there is a lot suspense in the moVie. But what's Very Different Is thaT the watchers neVer det answer to some of the Volatile secrets.... The Acting and screenplaY is very good. We get to see A completely different look of Natalie Portman with heR head saved off.... There are some occasional unexpected twists and turns too and the ending is not something we expect in comic film. The movie is pretty motivational as well and questions our sense of morale....Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici....#mustWatch....",8,2,5,26 June 2015
