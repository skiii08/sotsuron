Men in Black 3," Soooo much better than the 2nd one
","Okay guys I was like one year old when the first MIB movie came out, so it is a nostalgic movie of my childhood. I've seen it like a billion times when I was a little kid. And as I re-watched it years later, I still liked it. It had good lesson in the end, and it was hilarious. Generally I liked the second movie of the franchise as a child, but now its just...meh. It shouldn't have been made I think. So I had absolutely no great expectations for this one... BUT...It has blown my mind away. It was funny, it was smart, it had good visuals, good acting a fair plot. Don't get me wrong. It's not a timeless classic. Just a good flick to watch if you have time for going to the cinema.So because I'm such a nice girl, let's start with its flaws:Oh my gosh Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are so old for this movie. I mean just look at them. Yet, I must confess, almost all the good jokes were delivered from this fact.The bad guy. In fact I liked him, his looks the way he talked and all, but I felt that the writers of the film didn't give much thought into him.Young Agent O. She irritated me, greatly. I just didn't what was her purpose in the movie, outside of being K's love interest. BTW did you noticed that K had a secret love interest in every movie. He played the old good cool professionist, yet he was like the Captain Kirk of the franchise, IMO of course.So much about the flaws, let's see the cool stuff in MIB3:The relationship between K and J. Oh I know that this is the most marketable stuff in the franchise and for a reason. Oh for heaven's sake I just can't get enough of these two.The special effects. Of course they've improved since 1997 and all the new alien stuff works for advantage of the movie. Oh BTW the way J traveled in time was so awesome and creative I can't even tell.The sentiment and lesson in the end. Nice, makes you feel good after you walk out of the theater. This is simply what you can expect from a summer comedy. And in my opinion it wasn't corny or cheesy, just nice and fine the way it was.It. Was. Hilarious. I have laughed all through the movie. And that's the most you should expect from a comedy. (IMO, again)The acting. Oh Tommy ol' ol' Tommy, you were genial. You know what we want from Agent K and you give it to us. Will Smith did what he could I guess. But that 3 and a half year which he has skipped in acting didn't work at his best. Josh Brolin did just well as young Agent K. Gosh, he was cute.The bad guy. I know I've already listed him under the Negative List, but he was cool and funny. His looks were creative, and Jemaine Clement was very good at this role. Though I could barely recognize him.So. That's all folks. If you like the franchise you'll certainly like this, and if don't, well, you'll still have a good time watching it. Worth you're money. Worth a watch. Trust me.",7,2,4,29 July 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," WWII + Nazis + a superhero = FUN
","(I know I'm really really really late with this review, but I just can't help myself, I must put this down. So let's begin!)When I first heard about this project I was seriously concerned it'd be terrible, because WWII is a very serious and sensitive subject of history and mixing into this an American superhero story (or any kind of superhero story) would turn out to be embarrassing. Yet it was so good. Not a timeless classic, but a good action and superhero movie.Let's see what was good about it:<ul><li>I think Marvel Studios just knows somehow how to mix history into superhero/sci-fi/fantasy stories. The best example: X-men: First-class. And in the case of Captain America just turned out pretty well. Everything looks like it should look like. Everybody talks how they should. And even for my biggest surprise it's not funny, it (almost)takes itself seriously and it suits the flick. This almost realistic style gives me the chills in a good way.</li></ul><ul><li>The villain. I loved The Red Skull (a.k.a Johann Schmidt) in the comics, he was elegant, cool and intelligent, so just a perfect Nazi villain. So I was really glad when I found out Hugo Weaving will play him. Personally I'm a huge fan of Hugo Weaving, I loved him in his every role. And he didn't disappoint me this time either. Although his mask looked a bit...well... silly? I guess. But that didn't bother me. I think his costumes were very cool and the Hydra was great SS copy. I loved the weapons they've made. Although sometimes I just couldn't understand why they didn't use them. Oh whatever, little silly plot holes who cares?</li></ul><ul><li>The portrayal of Steven Rogers. I have to admit in the comics Steven Rogers is not such a greatly deep character. He is just the perfect American civilian and American soldier. He isn't such a hundred dimension character in the movie either, but he is sympathetic, kind, honest, honorable and merciful guy. An Average you can relate to. And I liked him. Chris Evans played Captain America just the way you'd expect him to. It's a mild performance, but satisfying.</li></ul><ul><li>The cast. Tommy Lee Jones was just perfect for the role of Tommy Lee Jones, and he really did it well. As I've already said Chris Evans was kinda good, and in my opinion Hugo Weaving was excellent. I also liked Hayley Atwell as the love interest. I. Really. Did. Like. Her. Oh my God for a superhero movie this girl was so cool. She was a soldier, she was intelligent, she was strong, she could look after herself and all. Girlpower! Just kidding. But really there should be more characters like her out there, and less characters like Bella Swan from Twilight.</li></ul><ul><li>The action sequences. Oh yes, these are important for an action movie. And they were pretty darn good. (Although there were some stupid things for ex. How could some hungry tired soldiers defeat hundreds of well trained Nazi elite warriors with laser weapons (or other)? Oh who cares?) these parts of the movie were sorta creative, too.</li></ul>So, I should also write down what I didn't like about the movie. Why did I give only seven stars to it if I can't even tell what was wrong about it? I really can't put my finger on it. I guess it's just that it is just a simple action movie. No deep lesson, though there IS a lesson, no big expectation. It just looks cool, it's enjoyable with little flaws. I wasn't bored by them so much so I could overlook them easily. I've seen this movie like 3 times already and I can still watch it because it's so ENTERTAINING.",7,0,1,31 July 2012
Prometheus," Plot holes, yet friggin' entertaining
","Guys, I was really confused after watching this movie. I knew it was horrible in some of its aspects. Yet... I couldn't tear away my eyes from the screen not for even a sec, it was so exciting, creative, spectacular. I just couldn't help myself, I loved it.Here's why:It was an Alien prequel (in a way, I know). I friggin' loved the Alien movies (even Alien3 and Resurrection, guilty pleasure, sue me guys). And this movie was a great follow-up to them. It was new, deep, thoughtful ( not EVERYWHERE) and as I've already said spectacular. The characters were well thought out. And even if the story was filled with plot holes, it was interesting, and it was exploring new yet ancient themes. Who are we? Why are we here? (BTW I felt like I was watching a sci-fi movie based on the writings of Erich von DÃ¤niken mixed with Alien)Okay, I have to confess and admit it. I'm a girl. And Michael Fassbender is more attractive than a bag of rocks. (Come on! Some of the dudes I know think this way about female actors) And his performance as David... EPIC. Oscar worthy. Loved it. He played so much better than the others in this movie. His character made the film. In my opinion of course. It was very well thought out. David was very far from being a human, yet I wanted to like him. He was like a cast-away among the crew members, everybody hated him. Oh, and I was so relived when it turned out he didn't actually die, just lost his gorgeous body (giggle, giggle, I've just seen Shame)The special effects very mind-blowing, huge, outstanding. If you've seen the movie, you know it. If you haven't you must see it.The design of the new aliens, or alien ancestors (well the monsters') was pretty darn good. Made me feel nostalgic. So that's what works in this film. And for its luck, what works, that works really well.BUT even I can't overlook those plot holes which are certainly there. So let's see them (well the important ones):<ul><li>Why did David poison Holloway with the alien egg (or whatever that tiny black thing was)? Why on earth did he do that? It occurred to me that Daddy Weyland told him to do so. But why would Daddy Weyland want to poison his crew members?</li></ul><ul><li>Not so important... BUT why was the fire flaming so much when Vickers killed Holloway if the stated that there was less oxygen in the planets atmosphere than in Earth's?</li></ul><ul><li>Why did the white faced ancestors wanted to kill humanity? It was stated that they wanted to create something new and in order to that they have to destroy. But... they'd already created US...</li></ul><ul><li>Why did Vickers go with them? She could've stayed home and be the leader of the company. Did she just want to see her father die so bad?</li></ul><ul><li>Why didn't Shaw's alien baby die? I mean, sure it was strong and everything, but...</li></ul><ul><li>Why took off the helmets? Guys, have you ever heard of viruses? bacterias? Oh, whatever.</li></ul><ul><li>Oh those guys who died first, they were idiots. Not a plot whole, but I just wonder how could they stay alive for such long time.</li></ul><ul><li>Why did the head of the ancestor explode? Seriously, why? (BTW it looked so funny...)</li></ul><ul><li>Why did the ancestor guy tear off David's head? Did the yelling and all go on his nerves? Did he get too annoyed by Shaw's whining and couldn't take the pressure anymore?</li></ul><ul><li>How could David move his body after he lost it? Clearly his body and his head were connected by wires... And those wires torn...</li></ul><ul><li>And why did Shaw have to let down David's body? He just could've jump down. he could move his body, that was clear (at least his arms, oh gosh that looked so funny)</li></ul><ul><li>How could Elizabeth move after her belly surgery? She could've used very strong drugs, I guess.</li></ul><ul><li>When the Prometheus arrived to the planet they just started to explore it. Why? Why didn't they just send there a robotic drone or a satellite before they arrived there? Would've been simple.</li></ul>And by the there some things that just annoyed me greatly, for example:<ul><li>Why was Vickers such an a..hole? She acted like a poisoned brat throughout the whole movie. For no reason than being a poisoned brat.</li></ul><ul><li>At a certain point of the movie almost the whole crew starts to have sex with each other. Vickers and the captain. Shaw and Holloway. Guys, why so irresponsible?</li></ul><ul><li>The map thing. That hologram. Just copied from Avatar. Just like that. But we can overlook that I guess.</li></ul>Okay, I guess there were many more plot holes there... But the atmosphere of the whole flick, the characters, the strange subject of the movie, it was just so entertaining and good I just couldn't help it. I love this. Hell I'm gonna own it. I have no idea how can Ridley Scott make a movie which is so bad, so full of plot holes, feel so good to watch over and over. And really Michael Fassbender as David just made the film.",9,3,9,28 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Best conclusion to a trilogy ever made
","Well, I will tell you the truth. A few months ago I thought that hype that was surrounding this movie will make it fail utterly. Yet here I am and I can't simply put it down in words how great awesome and cool and dark this flick was!First of all, let's see what was the best about the movie:Catwoman. Anne Hathaway was simply a scene stealer. I have to admit, I was much more interested in her, than in Batman. And even so I wasn't satisfied with her appearances, I would've like to find out her relationships more about, especially her relationship to her(girl)friend.The villain. Bane was one of the best villains ever portrayed in a movie. I admit his voice might be a bit too overdone and hard to understand. But I liked the way he talked, that he wasn't just a big tall muscle bag, he was intelligent.Batman wasn't in it in most of the time. Really I can count how much I've seen him with one of my hands. It really did good to the movie, we could explore the supporting cast's characters more. And it was just fine.The action sequences. Simply. They were mind blowing. Watch the movie, you'll see.So let's see what wasn't all that good about the movie:The conclusion, and the climax. It might be a bit controversial, but I didn't like that Bruce Wayne stayed alive after all. It'd be better and more dramatic if he'd stayed dead. I didn't like the perfect happy ending.And it was way too long for me. But that's MY opinion.So that's all folks. Watch this movie. You won't regret!",9,2,5,28 July 2012
