Insidious: Chapter 2," When the mystery is explained, what is there to scare us except the vulgar jump scare?
","Following the commercial success of the first chapter, Insidious: Chapter 2 eventually happened. With a lot of hype and anticipation, Insidious 2 arrived. Unfortunately, not with the quality standard of the first. The movie starts well, in an intriguing and mysterious way, but it doesn't take much time to understand what we are going to watch. It tries to be a direct sequel (what audiences normally wants), and thus we are presented with a squeezed new story that intertwines with the one of the first chapter, and kind of explains it, losing all the mystery. Mystery lost, Insidious 2 main weapon is the jump scare, the sudden loud sound effect, the ugly faces. When you understand whats in the dark, what could there be left to scare you? Barbra Hershey is forcefully presented on an almost main role on a plot that is filled with holes. By the end we have a full bag of unimaginative clichés and crappy fantasy, losing all the credibility this Insidious' 2 horror could have. It's a shame, because James Wan knows how to scare you, like he already proved this year with The Conjuring. Visit us on thefadingcam blog on blogspot.

Captain Phillips," A very competent thriller with a great lead
","Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is an effective commercial thriller with a great lead by Tom Hanks. The movie tells the 'true' story of a US ship that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009, and its captain who gives the movie its name. Being this story true or not, manipulated for Hollywood or not, Captain Phillips works as a movie, even if it is nowhere near the Bourne series. The way Greengrass works his limited set is very good, and he proves once again that he is one of the few masters of the shaky camera technique. If you are looking for a well directed, entertaining and legitimately suspenseful thrill, this is definitely the movie for you, but certainly nothing more than that. Don't try to see meanings where they don't exist. Globalization, poor/rich culture dichotomies? Maybe, but is it relevant? Haven't we seen all that hundreds of times before, and better?

Gravity," The best 3D experience ever so far, and also a great artistic movie
","Alfonso Cuarón created a visual experience that cannot be matched by any movie currently, period. And having watched it on 3D it felt like this was the only 3D was ever created, since this was the only 3D I have really ever enjoyed. Gravity is a successfully audacious movie that stretches contemplative pictures smoothly choreographed like a delicate dance into long takes (there is even an 18 minute long one). The silence of the space, the picture of earth, home, always on the background, associated with some beautifully positioned plans and adding only two characters transports the audience to a feeling that I honestly cannot remember with such intensity since 2001: A Space Odyssey, even if they are much, much different in presentation. There is a mix of digital techniques being used, as said by Cuarón himself. Knowing that and seeing the result feeling so real is indeed outstanding. However this movie isn't an experimental exercise on art, and we have a storyline that needs to be addressed. Cuarón keeps it simple and does it right yes, but there is some stuff that could be questioned. The storyline and character development is only briefly presented on screen even if it has a powerful meaning, leaving the question as if did Cuarón meant to take a deeper study on humanity's condition in pure loneliness (and plus, out of its home) through that same human symbolic simpleness that ends up being showed on screen, or did Cuarón just feel the need of supporting the movie with the characters backstory so that it could be a safer view for a larger audience? Whichever the answer, Gravity is a landmark, an author's work that changes the space genre for modern times as 2001: Space Odyssey did in 1968.

This Is the End," Not so good for the unprepared eye, but a great piece of filmmaking in reality
","It is hard to talk about This is The End in little words. Raised with great expectations, This is the End could easily be the biggest disappointment of the year. The movie could have ended up in a self-indulgent way of approaching aggravated versions of the real actors who play the movie. It could even end up in a silly 'spot the celebrity' movie. Fortunately, this was not the case. Well yes, the 'spot the celebrity part' is there, and it is awesome as there are dozens of cameos of well known comedy actors, but there is much more. The storyline, inserted in the crazy over the top apocalypse scenario, is guided by a series of small scenes, which you could define as small sketches, some awesome, others not that awesome, but overall with a great soul. The bromantic side of these group of actors is funny as hell, and their sissy versions of rich motherf**** actors is hilarious. But it's the inside jokes that stand out, the real movies where these actors played like Pineapple Express, Moneyball or even Million Dollar Baby are mocked, just like the actors themselves for some other not so good roles they have taken. And let's face it, the level of ambition of this movie was sky high, and as expected, there was some stuff that didn't turn out so smoothly. The overall movie feels strange, weird, sometimes it feels like an amateur comedy with bad computer effects, and it has a hard time connecting to the audience for a bit, but that is also part of its soul. It is large in numbers, but light in formula. But then we are presented by some scenes that really could go to the book of best scenes in comedy history, and that deserves a standing ovation. It's a delight to see Franco, Rogen, Jonah Hill (I could be here for ages) together, and the final product is indeed very weird but incredibly funny and original. This is the End is a comedy that you can compare with no other in style, breathing quality for almost every scene. Visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot for more reviews!",8,0,3,25 October 2013
World War Z," Pure suspenseful entertaining that should not be misled by its trailer
","World War Z was in production hell for quite a bit, changing writers and choosing directors for several times, leaving a fear that this project could have had a tragic ending. However, World War Z ends up being a really satisfactory movie. The directing has glimpses of quality and Brad Pitt is very well as the United Nations employee that travels the world looking for a possible cure. The movie is very tense from the beginning until the end delivering with quality what it promises: pure suspenseful entertainment. What I feared the most about this flick was the use of CGI for the infected zombies. However is does not go any farther than what the (very bad and totally misleading) trailer shows. World War Z does not use any gore either, choosing closed settings to build up the tension, and exploring the world's reaction to this plague in very different countries, which is interesting. Character development is a weak point tough, compared to the likes of 28 Days Later or even Dawn of the Dead. Even so, you will have a really great time with this one, and that's the only thing that matters in World War Z. Visit The Fading Cam blog for more!",7,2,4,18 July 2013
The Flowers of War," The other side of War
","Yimou Zhang (The House of the Flying Daggers, Hero) gets away of Chinese traditional heroes to approach a more serious topic: the Nanking rape massacre, set in 1937 during the Japanese invasion of the Chinese city of Nanking. Christian Bale is cast as an American grave digger that ends up posing as a priest to save a group of prostitutes and a group of former student young girls on a monastery. The camera and photography are very strong, with the mood set in a very sober fashion. Almost no soundtrack accompanies Flowers of War's powerful scenes, belonging to the amazing actors the responsibility of delivering emotions to the audience. The Flowers of War is not a traditional war movie as it focuses on the characters and their specific situation and not the war itself. This is the other side of war, the civilian side. Great performances and once again a stellar Christian Bale make you care for this amazing story that does not try to cheat you with a fake quality seal. The dialog is mainly Chinese spoken, only with Bale left with some room for English, making the Flowers of War very believable and immersive. It's a shame that this movie was so weakly divulged, this is a classic and one of the best foreign movies of 2011. Visit thefadingcam blog for more!",8,0,0,2 July 2013
Pacific Rim," The tribute is there, but in the end Pacific Rim cannot stand out
","I was very surprised to see that a movie with a concept like Pacific Rim where humans build giant robots to fight giant creatures that emerge from the ocean had such a positive reception, critics included. Seeing that it was directed by the brilliant Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) this really could be a rare quality entertaining movie. Del Toro wanted to make a tribute to classic monster movies like the original Godzilla and the feel is all there, even with his neo-psychedelic signature we all subtly enjoy. But essentially the question is if these movies were even good to begin with. Unfortunately, the result is just average. The plot and its presentation are not original at all, feeling that we are watching an average 90's movie. The characters are stereotypes, etc, etc, so there really isn't much to see here. And Rinko Kikuchi is probably the worst and most annoying actress ever. What's good in here is that, although this is a traditional commercial movie, the fight scenes are really awesome and very fun to watch, plus the special effects are incredible. It's a pity we have such a long and sometimes boring build up before all the action. You will have a good time, but Pacific Rim is what it is: a standard summer blockbuster with some glimpses of quality that really can't stand out.",6,1,6,25 July 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Starts with a few laughs, ends boring and very uninteresting..
","Being a Knocked Up fan I decided to watch the Judd Apatow movie that started it all. That is The 40 Year Old Virgin. Apparently this doesn't seem to be a quality comedy, but the positive reception had me feel this gap. The first half of the movie is average, with some laughs along the way, but as the time passes The 40 Year Old Virgin keeps getting more boring and uninteresting. Steve Carell's character fortunately is not the 'dork' one would expect, but as the movie tries to make him believable he just ends up being bland, and you won't really care for him. The movie attempts to be more a less a dramatic comedy, just as the follower Knocked Up did, but it really doesn't succeed. The idea of a 40 year old main character that's still a virgin soon dries up. Then sexual clichés start to appear, the f word starts being overused, and worst of all: moral tries to be taught to the audience. Unfortunately the only fun I had with this was with the characters played by Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd that really play a minor role... Visit the fading cam blog for more!",3,0,1,27 June 2013
Insidious," A dreadful modern chiller with a classic touch
","James Wan's 'Insidious' borrows, like almost every Hollywood horror flick, the clichés, jump scares, and ideas from all the commercial horror movies from the past decades. However, it manages to successfully build a mysterious, eerie and dreadful atmosphere. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne headline a cast that delivers a good portrait of the haunted family with a first half that sets the bar high, very high, that will leave you at the edge of the seat and afraid of dark. The final act tough begins too soon and drags for too long, taking the movie through a fantasy outcome that is doubtful and perhaps too literal. It is a nice chiller tough, and those are getting rarer by the day. Well done. Visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot for more!

Elysium," District 9 with a bigger budget, better actors, but without the originality effect
","Neil Bloomkamp presents Elysium, or should it be District 9 Part 2? The premise is pretty simple: in the future, the Earth gets overpopulated so the rich travel to a space station called Elysium where they live a luxurious life. In Elysium, director Bloomkamp once again chooses the way of the social message, masking it with a very entertaining and visually impressive action drama. Nothing to blame there. The directing is fine, we have many great actors, a thrilling plot, a true blockbuster. The thing is that in terms of model, this is exactly the same movie as District 9, sharing most of its ideas, only adding a bigger budget and a better cast, losing like that all the originality effect that District 9 was so praised about, even if it was a bit overrated at times. Like that, Elysium is just a competent blockbuster, one of 2013s best but certainly not the masterpiece many were expecting. Visit thefadingcam blog for more!",6,1,2,18 September 2013
12 Years a Slave," The historical confrontation through an unique visual experience
","12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen is on those authors whose movies will be remembered for many, many decades. This movie, just like Shame and Hunger, goes beyond the masterful aesthetic of the picture and camera to a sober, solid and honest drama about a free man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery on the United States. 12 Years a Slave embodies by nature the characteristics required to be considered an award winning movie, that is sure, but the movie goes a lot further and disconnects itself from that award aura. The north-American slavery theme is not a recurring one in cinema, even if the recent Django Unchained walked those steps one year ago. McQueen proposes a well paced movie that chooses feeling over gore, atmosphere over shock. The movie develops and gets better over time, presenting a lot of well written real characters that end up being shadowed by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender's unbelievable performances, only matched by Cate Blanchett's Blue Jasmine this year. 12 Years a Slave is not an easy movie to sit through, nor is it a particularly hard one. It is, above the drama, a contemplative movie that respects the audience. This is not a candy to chew on, but a gourmet dish to look at before tasting. Cinema at its best level, and probably the best movie of 2013. Visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot! Also like us on facebook to follow all our reviews!",9,7,14,6 January 2014
The Conjuring," The Exorcist of modern times
","The Conjuring is indeed a very, very positive surprise. I would honestly say that director James Wan succeeded in what could be called an Exorcist of current times. What makes it so good and original is that it presents a classic horror haunted house style for the first half (in a very well directed fashion, camera is perfect, such as color), then studies and analyses that horror through Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's characters: a couple of expert 'demonologists'. So, James Wan focuses on ambiance, suggestion, and, most importantly, characters (Lili Taylor is very well also), and is able to reenact the mood of the 80's horror is a very effective and entertaining fashion. Well done! Check out thefadingcam blog for more reviews!",7,0,1,22 September 2013
Looper," Almost a cult classic, but ultimately forgetful
","Looper approaches the condition of a cult classic, but doesn't really get there. Technically it is perfect: it's sober, solid, with great camera work, beautiful pictures and amazing editing. It is humble, and doesn't try to impose you its quality, not forcing you to like it, and that is a great attitude. The plot is very well written and interesting, even if some plot-holes common to time-travel themed movies may appear. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job impersonating a young Bruce Willis. Even his face's expressions are equal. Bruce Willis himself is also great, as great as any script allows him to be. It really is everything you could ask for a quality thriller movie with a sci-fi touch. The thing is, in this genre, you could expect a more breathtaking and ambitious touch, which means, although being everything a good thriller needs to be, Looper is not an unforgettable movie, one that astonishes you and makes you wondering for a long time. It is forgettable, but undoubtedly amazingly well done.",7,0,3,25 July 2013
