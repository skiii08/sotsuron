50 First Dates," It could have been good- but it wasn't.
","50 First Dates had the potential to be a sweet romantic movie about a guy trying to help the woman of his dreams fall in love with him every day, however it delivered a stupid movie filled with stalking, illogical ideas and penis jokes. Maybe I have too logical of a mind for a movie like this, didn't think I did, but apparantly I can't appreciate Rob Schiender in booty shorts and belly button tees and Sean Astin (who I used to respect) lisping in mesh muscle tank tops... this movie owes us a couple stars -**s",1,9,24,15 February 2004
Troy," This was not a good movie!
","Wow, this was one of the worst versions of any Homer story ever. The plots was mixed up, characters were missing and added, and the acting alone was atrocious. The only high spots in this movie were Erica Bana's actual ability to act and Diane Kruger's about average portrayal of Helen. Unfortunatly got Diane her Helen did not find an adaquet match with Orlando Bloom's Paris. It was just BAD. Lastly, Brad Pitt. Why did they want Achilles  be so nice (and straight?) it is not the way Achilles is written in history. Just because everyone loves Brad Pitt does not mean they should try and make Achilles so likeable. And sorry Brad, but that virgin priestess you deflowered did not exist in real history!! I gave it a 4- out of pity.",4,0,2,16 May 2004
