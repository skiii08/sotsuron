Changeling," Possible Spoiler? A warning - otherwise a fine movie
","Personally I don't think this comment takes anything away from the movie. Or do you want and like the full shock value?As a therapist/doctor I prefer people to be warned about two very upsetting scenes: 1, murder scene near beginning. 2, hanging scene near the ending.So watch out for or walk out for these two scenes. Still, I liked the movie. It was especially interesting regarding psychiatry's foibles. So much for those psychiatrists working with patients without looking at the true context surrounding the patient.Let's hear a cheer for family therapy, and taking a look at the whole picture!",8,4,9,2 November 2008
