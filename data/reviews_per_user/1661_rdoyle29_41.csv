Blade Runner 2049," The best and the worst of 'Blade Runner' intensified
","I can't say I particularly liked the 'Blade Runner' sequel. That seems odd to say since it's a beautiful looking film that I like many parts of, but I thought the plot was kind of terrible, especially as a sequel to the first film. It has a laser focus on the parts of the original film that really do not work, and then runs with them constructing a whole plot out of them. I can't say I cared about any minute of the actual plot. If the first film kind of works despite having a vague plot and a host of badly drawn characters, this seems to accentuate both the best and worst elements.",7,4,8,9 October 2017
Scarface," A big, broad glorious masterpiece
","It's difficult to see a film that's as big a part of the culture as this one with fresh eyes, but I must say, every time I watch this film, it feels like a slightly different and even better film. I think it's tonally a lot closer to it's source material than it's usually given credit for. It's in many ways an old fashioned film, even telling a very key part of it's story using the type of montage you see in films from the 30's and 40's. All of the 80's gloss and extreme violence is layered on a plot that's beat for beat the same as Hawks's film. Pacino's performance has often been ridiculed for being oh so very big, but I'm not sure what anybody should expect in a portrayal of Tony Montana. He's a character almost completely lacking an inner life who subsists entirely by bluffing and and convincing others that he's stronger than them. He's all action without thought.",10,0,0,10 December 2017
Sucker Punch," Ridiculous garbage
","Cinematic non-entity Emily Browning stars as an orphan living in some Gothic version of 1950's America. Problems with her ridiculously evil stepdad lands her in a mental hospital (or home for the 'mentally insane' as the film calls it ... distinguishing from a home for the physically insane I suppose), from which she escapes by ... perhaps ... imagining that she's in a cabaret/brothel where her and a troop of other girls have to dance for the customers. From this fantasy reality she occasionally slips into a further fantasy reality (no, I don't know how that's supposed to work either), where her and the other girls fight dragons and Nazi robots using swords and machine guns. There are elaborate parallels between the 3 levels of reality, but it would be a lie to say I stopped caring because I really never started caring about any of this. It's difficult to imagine another case where so many resources were spent on so little.",4,5,11,7 July 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," A nice little chamber thriller
","Mary Elizabeth Winstead gets into a car accident and wakes up in a bunker owned by John Goodman. Goodman tells her that a world ending event is going on outside and he saved her life. She thinks that maybe he's nuts and just kidnapped her. She stays in the bunker with Goodman and workman John Gallagher Jr. (who believes Goodman and fought to get in), not sure which way the preponderance of evidence really points. This taut little thriller is essentially a 3 person chamber piece anchored by a very strong performance by Goodman and equally good work from Winstead. It probably should have ended 10 minutes before it does.",8,0,1,5 August 2017
Train to Busan," Great stuff for such a tired genre
","A rather neglectful father is taking his daughter by train to visit her mother on the day the zombie apocalypse hits. Naturally zombies get on the train and all hell breaks loose. 'Zombies on a train' doesn't sound like the most original concept, but writer/director Sang Ho-Yeon not only manages to find interesting things to do with it, he rather effortlessly stretches it out to 2 hours of really intense action ... and he works in some interesting character dynamics too. There's nothing startling here, but it's not predictable and it's actually rather difficult to predict who will live and who will die. Great stuff especially for a really tired genre.",8,1,2,3 April 2017
12 Angry Men," The best film of it's type
","There's some interesting alchemy going on in this film. While it's extremely realistic in it's look and attention to detail, it's a highly stylized and somewhat mechanical film. All the characters are clearly defined by the single aspect they bring to the scenario and they interact more like types than real people. The story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. None of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and Lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind. Fonda specialized in playing the voice of middle-class intellectual liberalism in the early 60's and it's largely because of his performance here.",10,1,1,9 September 2017
Bloody Sunday," A good film almost done in by it's idiotic stylistic quirks
","Paul Greengrass directs this dramatization of the civil rights march that ended with British paratroopers killing 13 civilians, kicking off the long and bloody civil war that engulfed Northern Ireland for the next 30 years. Greengrass manages to do justice to the events despite his terrible visual style that involves an insanely shaky camera and hundreds of pointless jagged edits. This is largely chalked up to 'documentary realism', but no documentarian would be happy with a film that consciously draws attention to it's own stylistic quirks and away from the events depicted in the film. James Nesbitt stars as Ivan Cooper, a politician who organized the march and bore witness to much of the slaughter. He does a magnificent job of depicting hope and optimism dying.",7,4,5,12 August 2017
Finding Nemo," superb animated film
","Stanton, who helped write 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.', co-wrote and directed this computer-animated comedy-adventure about finding a very small fish in a very large ocean. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is a more-than-slightly paranoid Clown Fish who is extremely devoted to his young son, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould). Nemo is the only survivor after a hungry barracuda swallowed up Nemo's mother and her other offspring. It's not Marlin's nature to explore unfamiliar waters, but when Nemo is captured by a diver near the Great Barrier Reef and ends up in a dentist's fish tank, Marlin gathers his courage and sets out to find his son. As Marlin searches for his son, he makes friends with a friendly but absent-minded Regal Blue Tang named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), a Great White Shark named Bruce (voice of Barry Humphries) who is trying to cut fish out of his diet, a beach-rat Sea Tortoise named Crush (voice of Stanton), and Nigel (voice of Geoffrey Rush), a Pelican who can take Marlin's search from the ocean to dry land. 'Finding Nemo''s impressive voice cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, Eric Bana, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Bruce Spence. 	'Finding Nemo' is a superb achievement on three distinct levels. First, the look of the film is gorgeous. The Pixar crew has created a fully realized underwater world. The colors are bright and entrancing, while the movement of the fish is so realistic that the viewer never for a second suspends disbelief. The story is beautifully structured. After establishing the relationship between Marlin and Nemo, the film sets up the separate worlds they each inhabit (the ocean and the fish tank). The screenwriters have dreamed up creative plot points, formulating exciting obstacles (like the wrecking of a filtration system, a dangerous jellyfish zone, and a fish-killing eight-year-old) that allow the film to maintain an exciting pace without sacrificing character or humor. Each member of the cast appears to have been hired for their skills as a performer more than for their name recognition. Brooks, DeGeneres, and Dafoe all communicate real emotional truth in their characters, while such talented vocal performers as Root, Rush, and Humphries lend pitch-perfect comedic support. 'Finding Nemo' is an inventively written, gorgeously drawn, and perfectly acted animated film.",8,0,2,11 September 2003
The Hustler," A bleak autobiographical gem
","This bleak fable of talent, compromise, doomed love, death, and redemption is a profoundly autobiographical work by Robert Rossen, who was badly affected by HUAC.  He had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and at his first HUAC appearance refused to name names, but ultimately changed his mind and testified against friends and colleagues.  'The Hustler' is about a man who has talent and passion but sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a Faustian pact to gain character.  Bert Gordon is explicitly likened to the Devil by Findlay. Eddie emerges chastened and redeemed.  Some of the dialogue is a touch portentous, especially in the love scenes, but it is a wonderfully exhilarating and depressing film that blends elements of period jazzy existentialism, moody religious parable, the qualities of a simply great sports movie and terrific performances from Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, and George C. Scott.",10,4,6,4 September 2000
Insomnia," a frequently overlooked gem
","Al Pacino stars as a Los Angeles homicide detective sent along with is partner Martin Donovan to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help with the investigation of a brutal homicide. They have partly been sent because local police chief Paul Dooley is a retired LA cop, but also because Internal Affairs has been investigating them and their boss wants them out of town. Donovan reveals to Pacino that he's been considering cooperating, a move that would ruin Pacino. While tracking down the murderer, a brutal accident puts Pacino in the hot seat. He tries to cover up his involvement, while suffering from insomnia due to the 24 hour daylight in this part of the world. Local rookie cop Hilary Swank, a great admirer of Pacino's, starts to realize something is wrong ... and the murderer (Robin Williams) himself contacts Pacino, revealing he knows what really happened and that he can help them both. This seems to be the least talked about of Nolan's films, which is a shame because it's a sharp and interesting remake of the 1997 Norwegian film that starred Stellan Skarsgard in Pacino's role. It's not a carbon copy of the original film, going different places with the same material. It's also one of the last really strong performances we got from Pacino.",8,1,1,19 November 2017
The Town," Possibly a good film hiding in there
","I think there's probably a decent action film buried in this really long and ponderous film. As it is, you get some great sequences like an armored car robbery/car chase, but you have to sit through the endless set up of the Charlestown locale, an incredibly implausible relationship drama and a dozen speeches about how Affleck is going to change. Somehow the film never manages to find the time during it's two hour run time to explain how Affleck could plan and execute a robbery of Fenway Park while under constant FBI surveillance.",7,0,1,9 October 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A darkly comic, morally complex masterpiece
","Frances McDormand's daughter was raped and murdered, and it seems like no movement has happened on the case in months. Noticing three derelict billboards on a largely unused stretch of road just out of town, she rents them and puts up a personal challenge to local police chief Woody Harrelson. The police department, especially thuggish cop Sam Rockwell, are very unhappy about this turn of events. The town is divided. Harrelson is a popular man, but the department has a history of mistreating the town's less fortunate citizens (particularly the African American population), so many folks like seeing them called to task. This sets up what seems to be a very straightforward 'little guy vs authority' story, but McDonagh has a more morally complex story in mind. Harrelson is a dying man, suffering from terminal cancer, and his explanation of why the case has gone nowhere seems quite reasonable. McDormand is suffering from understandable grief, but you learn that some of the grief might stem from a feeling of personal responsibility for the tragedy. Good characters do some really bad things. Bad characters commit horrifically violent actions, but then suffer from violence due to heroically self-sacrificing acts. Besides being a serious meditation on grief and revenge, it's also very darkly comic.",9,12,27,5 December 2017
Baby Driver," A magnificent action musical
","This film opens with a robbery and car chase, not exactly set to 'Bellbottoms' by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, but more like choreographed to it. I can truly say I was 100% with this one from the very beginning. There are similar action sequences set to 'Neat Neat Neat' by the Damned and 'Hocus Pocus' by Focus. They are all incredible. It doesn't stop there ... music suffuses this film. All the performances are good ... Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm stand out as criminals who are varying degrees of menacing ... but this is really a film about music and action. I do think that the last half hour works a bit less well than the rest of it. In particular, I thought the climactic action set to 'Brighton Rock' by Queen was a lot more frenetic and less well choreographed than the rest of the film, but by this point in the film, it's a quibble to say that it's working less well.",9,4,8,12 July 2017
Pitch Black," a limited success on a meager budget
","Screenwriter and director David Twohy has made a career out of crafting challenging, well-mounted science fiction films via limited means. With this somewhat derivative but enjoyable action thriller, he nearly succeeds. Most of the casting in Pitch Black is by type and thus instantly forgettable, though given the story's haunted-house horror movie structure, this is probably by design. The film is anchored by Radha Mitchell and the strutting, grunting Vin Diesel, relative newcomers who prove their mettle on the big screen with reflective performances marked by detailed, intuitive choices. As he did with Warlock (1988), Disaster in Time (1992), and The Arrival (1996), Twohy takes what was intended to be a straight-to-video genre potboiler and transforms the project into something at least a cut above other examples of its type. Unfortunately, in all of these projects, the writer/director is at times overcome by shoestring budgets that hamstring his creative efforts to impress visually.",6,0,0,31 August 2003
Dunkirk," A pretty damn good film
","I think this is a really good film. I don't think it's a masterpiece and I don't think it's even Nolan's best piece of work. It's not like any other war film I've seen. Although it has three interlocking stories, it seems more devoted to creating an immersive experience for the audience, and it does that extremely well. It's an impressive technical achievement. Oddly, although I found it to be suspenseful and absorbing in parts, I also found it to be a bit of a distanced experience. I was super aware of all the parts were fitting together, and felt like I was watching a mechanism run more than getting involved in a story. For example, I think Hans Zimmer's score is effective, but it's effect is right there on the surface drawing attention to itself the whole time.",8,0,5,8 August 2017
Captain America: Civil War," A pretty damn good comic book flick
","This is one of the better Marvel films. It bites off a lot of items ... continuing the Winter Soldier plot, introducing Black Panther, introducing Spider-Man, continuing the Avengers plot, bring Ant-Man into the greater fold ... but without succumbing to the 'too many plot lines' issue that buries so many comic book sequels. It even manages to work in a climax that does not involve blue light shining up into the sky and all the heroes fighting hordes of enemies. It's not as good as the previous Captain America film and nowhere near as refreshing as 'Guardians of the Galaxy', but it delivers what a film like this should and it does it well.",8,0,1,12 June 2017
The Princess Bride," A decidedly okay film
","I like this movie. I don't think I love it as much as some folks do. It's an agreeable fairy tale with an enjoyably self-aware, slightly cynical sense of humor. When it works, the sword fight between Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin for example, it really excels. When it doesn't ... Billy Crystal, some of Andre the Giant's acting ... it just kind of lies there, but never for too long. It sometimes feels to me like the film thinks its' absolutely hilarious, while maybe it's just pretty damn amusing.",8,1,1,4 June 2017
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A cracker jack action flick
","One of the rare cases of a long running film series that seems to be getting better over time. The first film was good ... a bit of solid, mainstream entertainment. The 2nd and 3rd ... not really very good at all. I can't say I had high expectations for a 4th film in this series, but it basically delivers the most you could expect from a film like this. A bunch of really well-done action sequences, a group of engaging characters and a plot that is at least minimally sensible.",8,0,0,19 July 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," A remarkable visual classic
","One of the most beautiful films ever made, this biopic of a tortured cult figure became, like 'Heart of Darkness' and 'Nostromo' (a long-cherished but unrealized dream of David Lean's), a cult project.  Many directors tried to bring the story to the screen - Lewis Milestone, Zoltan Korda, William K. Howard, and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger - with numerous stars considered for the lead, including Robert Donat, Leslie Howard, Laurence Olivier, and Cary Grant.  With a cast led by newcomer Peter O'Toole and nearly two years spent shooting in the desert, Lean emerged with a vast and compelling study of Lawrence.  The film is remarkable for its central character's ambiguous personality, confused motivations and sexuality, his love/hate of violence, as well as its extraordinary design and cinematography.",10,0,2,13 September 2000
City of God," A magnificent film
","This Brazilian film is extremely reminiscent of 'Goodfellas' in the way it tells a complex story with many characters and jumps around in time, telling a story up to a point, and then jumping back to establish more context. It's also a visually inventive and immensely entertaining story about criminals, told from the POV of someone in the middle of the action, and creates understanding about why these people are criminals without compromising on the brutal nature of their lives. It's also, like 'Goodfellas', loosely based on fact. This isn't just like 'Goodfellas', it's almost as good as it.",10,0,0,19 October 2017
Dog Day Afternoon," Such a great film
","Sidney Lumet had an extraordinary talent for making movies that kind of sneak up on you with their greatness. I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and I know I love it, but I'm consistently surprised by just how great it really is and how many different things this film tackles and how well it accomplishes everything. It's a character study and it contains what is easily one of Pacino's greatest performances. (I was struck by how much you can just enjoy staring at Pacino's face on film.) It's about the relatively new phenomena of a media circus surrounding an event, and it's probably never been dealt with in a better way on film. It's pretty much a perfect film.",10,1,2,8 November 2017
School of Rock," A decent comedy elevated by a good cast and director
","Jack Black stars as a failed rock musician who in financial desperation, pretends to be his friend Mike White and takes a job as a substitute teacher at a prestigious private elementary school. Having no qualification, he initially treats it as an opportunity to goof of, until he realizes that his students are fairly gifted musicians. He trains them to be a rock band so that he can enter a battle of the bands competition and get revenge on his former band mates who kicked him out. Do I even need to tell you that Black learns to care about these kids? There's really nothing original here, but Black is in his element here and makes the material work. He gets some pretty solid support from Joan Cusack as the school principal. It's hardly among Richard Linklater's best films, but his relaxed, stoner style is well suited for the material.",8,1,1,9 November 2017
Hero," A magnificent art house epic
","The King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) is waging a war to unite all the kingdoms of China under his rule. This has created enemies, and three assassins, Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) have vowed to kill him. Broken Sword and Flying Snow stormed his palace once and almost succeeded. Since then, no one is allowed within 100 paces of the King. Nameless (Jet Li) comes to the palace bearing proof that he has killed all 3 assassins. He is granted audience with the King and tells the story of how he defeated them ... with each story, he is rewarded and allowed to come closer to the King. When he is done, and only 10 paces from the King, the King expresses skepticism and offers his version of what he thinks really happened. A third version of the story is then told, which comes closer to the truth and reveals that it all comes down to these two men looking at each other face to face. The success of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and the reunification of Hong Kong with Mainland China made possible the situation where China's celebrated art house director teamed with a cast of prominent Hong Kong stars to make a martial arts epic. This is a happy circumstance. Zhang Yimou creates a sumptuous epic that's both visually stunning (each version of the story is uniquely colour coded) and thoughtful ... considering what a hero would actually be in Chinese culture.",8,0,0,22 October 2017
Sing Street," A real joy
","A teenage boy in 1980's Dublin forms a band to impress a girl. His discovery of music helps him negotiate his chaotic domestic situation and the tough Catholic school he attends. A really interesting blend of well-told coming-of-age drama with music from the 80's. As our protagonist hears new styles of music, his style and the type of music he writes changes to reflect his new interests, so while he starts writing poppy tunes, he's soon writing music influenced by The Cure, Spandau Ballet and Hall & Oates. It works primarily because the songs written by director Carney are all really good and reasonable facsimiles of music from this time and place.",8,2,3,29 July 2017
From Dusk Till Dawn," Like a really mediocre Tarantino film
","It had been many years since I saw this and I had not remembered how much this is like a Tarantino film. It's not just that the script has his hallmarks, Rodriguez shoots many of the scenes exactly the way Tarantino would have (shot looking up from inside a trunk anyone?). It's really like a pretty mediocre Tarantino film. It's got all the elements of one of his films, but they never really gel. That's all about the first half. The second half of this film is a pretty generic action-horror-gorefest. It's not bad, but it's never anything more than okay. This does stand out as one of the less obnoxious Tarantino on screen appearances.",7,1,2,20 April 2016
The Graduate," A beautiful film ... until it stops focusing on Mrs. Robinson
","I think I have underestimated how much I like this film, at least the first hour of it. I have seen it a few times and knew I liked it, but I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely funny it is. That said, I don't really like the last act, and that's largely due to the fact that Mrs. Robinson feels like the real emotional center of this film, but she's reduced to a one dimensional villain during the final act. While Benjamin comes off as a fool, and Elaine is barely a character, Mrs. Robinson is funny, clever and kind of sad ... a very engaging character. The film doesn't really survive her departure.",9,0,1,27 June 2017
This Is Spinal Tap," One of the best films about rock music
","One of the sharpest films ever made about the music business, both hilarious and accurate.  It presents every cliche about life on the road, and gets them right.  Many of the ideas of the film are based on the archetypes of rock history:  the emergence of rock and roll bands in Britain in the sixties, moving through skiffle and psychedelia to heavy rock; the tensions and homosexual undertones in the relationship between singer and lead guitarist; the craziness and limited lifespan of drummers; the pretentiousness of concept albums, especially those involving old English/Celtic mythology.  The lasting power of the film is shown by the fact that it is almost impossible to discuss the history of rock music without referring to some moment as 'Tap-like'.",8,0,1,27 September 2000
Reservoir Dogs," A dazzling blend of influences and originality
","The script for 'Reservoir Dogs' was written in just three weeks and is a blend of originality, enthusiasm, and homage.  Quentin Tarantino worked in a video store and turned himself into a sponge and encyclopedia of cult, often violent, marginal and sometimes classic cinema.  The film is dedicated to, among others, the cult figures Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville, Chow Yun Fat, and Roger Corman.  The taut screenplay is filled with references to Tarantino's favourite films:  'The Killing', 'White Heat', 'Rififi', 'Ocean's Eleven', and 'Straight Time' (based upon the book by Eddie Bunker, who plays Mr. Blue), among many others.  The concept of a gang of mutual strangers known only by colours appears in the New York subway heist film, 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three', one of Tarantino's favourites.  A key source was another Tarantino favourite, Ringo Lam's 'City On Fire', which features Chow Yun Fat as an undercover cop infiltrating a jewel gang, scenes in a cafe, a sequence where the cool-looking gang walk in hip, bedraggled unity towards the camera, and concludes with an identically composed Mexican stand-off.  Another source was 'Odd Man Out'.  The film is fascinating for its complex borrowings, but most admirable for the profane poetry of the dialogue, the complexity of the narrative structure (similar to 'Rashomon'), and the stylishly camp soundtrack.  It is supremely cool, and gained an instantly devoted following.  Everything about it was taken from somewhere else, and yet it has a style all of its own that established the Tarantino signature - a look and sound all its own.",10,0,1,20 September 2000
Total Recall," among Verhoeven's best North American films
","Total Recall revels in the state-of-the-art special effects and frantic violence characteristic of most of director Paul Verhoeven's American productions. Though based on a story by Philip K. Dick, Total Recall is more of an action movie than a philosophical rumination on identity. Still, the film gets a lot of mileage out of the questionable notion that 'you are what you remember.' The screenplay was finally credited to seven screenwriters; it had bounced around Hollywood for a number of years with different directors and stars before it reached Verhoeven. The director's brand of high-octane, cartoonish, violence is a good fit with the material, though his style may have been better-suited to 1988's more satiric Robocop. The movie received a special-achievement Academy Award for its impressive effects.",8,0,1,31 August 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's slightest film
","On repeat viewing, this is my least favourite Kubrick film. I do not think his leads are up to the task. Cruise is simply okay, as he often is, but Kidman is really quite terrible. Kubrick has a tendency to let his characters overact which can work out well (George C. Scott in 'Dr. Strangelove') or not so well (Patrick Magee in 'A Clockwork Orange). In Kidman's case, it's quite disastrous. 2 1/2 hours is far too long for such a slight story, and it seems to have been stretched out by slowing the dialogue to a deathly pace in most scenes. While the plot largely follows Schnitzler's novel, he has replaced the novel's conclusion with a puzzlingly arbitrary resolution that seems completely detached from the plot that precedes it.",6,0,2,26 May 2012
The Departed," Good ... not great
","I like this film, but I certainly don't love it. My biggest problem with it is that I just don't like Nicholson in this one. It's not that I think he gives a particularly bad performance. I just think he's the entirely wrong person to be playing this part. (Is there a right person to be playing an apparently Irish gangster named 'Frank Costello'? Where the hell does that name come from?) He really seems to be walking around in a different film from the rest of the cast. His giant presence seems to pull the focus of the film away from where it should be sitting with Damon and DiCaprio. I have a few other small issues. Scorsese's usually infallible feel for music seems to have let him down here since he includes both the intolerably awful Dropkick Murphys and a terrible version of 'Confortably Numb' by Roger Waters with Van Morrison's band (???). I do like Vera Farmiga quite a lot here, but I'm ultimately unclear why her character is in the film.",8,0,2,10 May 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Incredibly rewarding for fans of classic Hollywood
","A rambling shaggy dog story set in Hollywood of the 1950's ... a movie star (George Clooney) is kidnapped off the set of a Biblical epic he's starring in. There are a couple of distinct but related subplots, and all of it ties back to studio exec Josh Brolin trying to put out all the fires while considering a better job offer from Lockheed. Every once in a while, the Coens make a film simply because it amuses them and allows them to exercise their love of classic Hollywood. This is one of those. They stage multiple scenes from films being made by this studio ... musicals, westerns, comedies, epics ... and each is a meticulously recreated pastiche of a 50's film. If you're on their wavelength, it's immensely rewarding. If you're not, it's a bunch of stars gathered together for a plot that ultimately goes almost nowhere. I'm in the first camp ... I loved this.",8,1,2,28 July 2017
The Wrestler," A mundane film elevated by outstanding work
","There is nothing startlingly original here. The story of a has-been hanging on to past glory has been done a million times, and here it's largely constructed with stock characters ... a stripper with a heart of gold, an alienated daughter ... we've seen it before. What makes this gem stand out is the remarkable lead performance by Rourke ... among other things, one of the best physical performances I have seen in a drama ... his amazing supporting cast (Marisa Tomei in particular), and Aronofsky's surprisingly restrained, realistic treatment of the material.",9,1,1,3 July 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," A masterpiece
","You know ... everyone is aware how good of a movie this is, and it's cultural repercussions are immense. David Fincher's entire career is based on this film's existence. Still ... it's a film I tend to take for granted, partly because for every good thing that it spawned (the 'Hannibal' TV show), there's a ton of garbage (all of it's film sequels). I'm so sick of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector that I tend to forget how wonderful he originally was. This is a brilliant film that takes so many chances and just works ... it hums.",10,0,2,20 November 2017
X-Men: First Class," A passable comic book flick
","As comic book reboot movies go, this is pretty good. It's got a really good cast, particularly Fassbender and McAvoy, and a nice sleek retro look. Kevin Bacon makes a great villain. But ... we're really looking at a movie that's about 75% uninteresting filler characters and keeps revisiting themes that the previous trilogy kinda drove into the ground. It does it's job, but it really isn't memorable.",7,0,0,8 July 2017
Casino," Really good ... not great
","It's inevitable that you end up comparing 'Casino' to 'Goodfellas', which is too bad because it doesn't really stand up to that comparison (very little does). 'Casino' has a lot of great performances in great scenes with great dialogue, but it doesn't really hold together as a great narrative. I get the feeling while watching it that I could re- order most of the scenes and it would play just as well. I think it's because the subject matter here is a lot bigger, and the sprawling 3 hour film still feels like it's leaving out a lot as it crams a ton of dense detail into it's narration. A really good Scorsese film, but not a great one.",8,1,2,10 December 2017
Fast Five," Grade A junk ... I love it
","The fifth movie in this series is where it really hits its stride. It brings together all the major characters from the first 4 movies into one plot line that largely abandons to street racing angle in favour of a really silly heist plot peppered with several outstanding action sequences. This is a vast improvement because the plot and characters have always been the weak point of this series, so de-emphasizing them in favour of action provides a winning formula. While the action sequences are not exactly realistic, they are grounded in practical stunt work and not a ton of CGI, so they feel more realistic than they have any right to do. This is really top quality junk, and I wish we got more big budget action films like it.",9,0,0,5 September 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Yeah ... it's fine, but ...
","I would file this film under 'good idea executed kind of poorly'. A lot of it doesn't really make much internal sense. Apparently our group of kids 'picked' the form of their demise once they arrived at the cabin ... but the cabin is named after this threat, as established before they got their. The form of the ritual that needs to be performed is very very specific, yet none of the other ones we see happening match the form at all. Why would the facility have a button that opens all the cells at once? Well ... all that aside, I generally think that as horror parody, it's very thin. I don't understand the 'it's going to permanently change the genre' hype that went on. 'Tucker and Dale vs. Evil' is a far better skewering of genre tropes than this.",7,2,2,11 October 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," A great cartoon ... but still a cartoon
","I'm going to have to be 'that guy' and admit that I didn't like this as much on second viewing. I don't think my opinion about any of the parts has changed, but my relative weighting of their importance has shifted. I'll say right up front, I don't think this is a bad film. A lot of it is more than a little exceptional. The action scenes, especially the final chase, are incredible. It's pretty much everything else about it that I could do without. The story and characters are pretty dumb. That's not a new thing ... it's pretty much true of all the films in this series, and it's what really buries the 3rd one. But in past films, none of the bad elements are amped up to absurd levels through the use of excessive CGI and a ridiculously frenetic pace. If you consider 'The Road Warrior', that film's grounding in a very real seeming physicality gives it's broad sketchy characters the aura of archetypes. It's like a post apocalyptic western. This film feels like a cartoon, or maybe a video game. A really really good one, but still ... a video game.",8,1,2,30 June 2017
Sully," Pretty okay film
","This is a fairly solid film that has, as it's centerpiece, a fairly incredible feat of aviation and an impressive rescue operation. The problem is that a feature film needs to be built around that, and you feel the film straining to pad itself out. Hanks is really good in a role that pretty much tailor made for him. Aaron Eckhart provides solid support. As always, Eastwood crafts a well-made, no-nonsense film. But the film strains to create drama out of an National Transportation Safety Board investigation that never manages to feel like anything more than people doing the job they are supposed to do. Yes, there's some evidence that maybe Sully made the wrong decision, but that's fairly easily dismissed and nobody really fights it when a reasonable argument is made. It ends up feeling like a great 15 minute short wrapped up in a mediocre film.",7,1,1,10 August 2017
Evil Dead II," An amazing sequel to a classic horror film
","One of the best horror sequels ever made, and a key film in the development of the horror comedy in the 1980's (the most significant decade in that genre's development). Raimi walks a very fine line successfully ... reproducing all of the elements that were most loved about the original film while altering the tone enough to make what is essentially a remake seem completely fresh. While I still marginally prefer the first film to this one, this is a rare example of a sequel that equals the original film in nearly every aspect.",8,1,2,16 July 2017
