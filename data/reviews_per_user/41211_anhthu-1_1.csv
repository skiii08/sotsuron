Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Watched Borat on DVD
","Now, like many other skeptics, I was hesitant at first to watch Borat. Date Movie and Epic Move have tarnished what was left of the genre of 'dumb' comedies, and I wasn't overeager to watch a movie that some people claimed was overrated.However, after the first ten minutes of the movie I was barely breathing, having laughed uncontrollably. Everything under the sun was mocked in the film. Some privates were exposed and there were dirty jokes, but it was the funniest thing I've seen in forever. Everything was so original. The reactions were hysterical. And through it all, Cohen managed to keep a straight face, something I thought impossible.I give this 10/10 and urge you to go rent Borat. But please, this is a stupid film. Leave your seriousness behind and relax.",10,1,23,12 March 2007
