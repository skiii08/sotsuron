First Man," Disappointing.
","I greatly admire Damien Chazelle's work In this film and I think Claire Foy should receive an Oscar nomination. However, when the movie was over I felt like all of the joy had been sucked out of what is one of America's greatest triumphs.",3,2,4,29 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Too many plot holes.
","Caution spoilers! Although excellently acted, it is riddled with plot holes. For example, the creatures can hear minor noises (a toy, lamp falling over) from miles away but can't hear breathing, moaning or heartbeats in the same room. The timeline is at 400+ days but who planted the corn, the creatures? How is the electricity generated? There is no way to know because there is almost no exposition just newspapers tacked to wall. Very poor.",2,5,9,23 April 2018
