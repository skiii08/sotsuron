Marie Antoinette," Coppola establishing her visual style
","As soon as I heard That this movie was being penned by Sofia Coppola, I knew what to expect. She delivers another extremely visual movie which is driven by a loose plot. It has many of the same elements of 'Lost in Translation' which the savvy movie-goer will instantly recognize. I will say that I enjoyed the movie, especially the soundtrack. Some of the acting left a bit to be desired (Marianne Faithful as Marie's mother)but this was tempered by solid performances by the usually overtly-smiley Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman. The sets and costumes were amazing. If anything, see this movie for the music and the visual indulgences.",8,3,6,22 October 2006
