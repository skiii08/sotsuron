The Avengers," Great Movie, only improvement would have been a better villain
","I wish there were 20 or 30 more of these movies! It's really fun to watch superheros interact, especially when their back stories are so well done via previous movies. Other reviewers are correct saying that these actors are choice to play these characters. My only complaint is that hey - the 'super' villain Loki was never really very threatening. He was always a sort of weakling in Thor, though interesting. In this movie his only trick is tapping a cane against your chest to control your mind, and being a ruthless jerk, I guess. Scary, practically speaking, but it's not an equal match to four or five movies worth of enemies that we already know the good guys can chew through individually. The bad guy aliens came through the hole in the sky at a rate of about 1 every 3 seconds, kind of trickled through. I'd say we didn't even need the Avengers to dispatch those flying motorcycles - the US Air Force could have handled this whole bunch pretty neatly, though NY would have suffered a bit more. So then why were the Avengers necessary? I dunno, it just seems like the big terrible event that had everyone so worried wasn't that bad. I want a really really scary threat, like the new spider man has to defeat, not some whiny loser like Loki.",9,3,8,11 June 2012
Prometheus," Good symbolism, great imagery, not as solid/believable as Alien(s)
","Just saw the movie, then read a review focusing on the 2000 years ago - part. We killed Jesus. And actually, I felt that the most intense moment in the film was Elizabeth Shaw laying on the ground mumbling something remorseful, just before the beheaded David talked to her through her com. The anguish of knowing that your own ambition and risk/hopeful going off on your own (sin? knowledge..?) have damned you to a tortured, wasteful end. Very, very Christian guilt nightmare there. It's like - hey lady you want to doubt God and find Engineers? here you go, sorry you didn't just want to be a good sheep. God was right, now you're super damned and it's all your fault...Glad that wasn't the real ending. What bothers me about the movie? As in Alien and many other sci-fi movies, creatures are able to grow to tremendous sizes with absolutely no food and in almost no time. The original Alien kind of leaned that way, but maybe it found some food somewhere and was just a fast grower. The octocrotch monster grew from 1-2 pound fetus to a 400-500+ pound giant squid in a few hours while locked in a plastic room, after being gassed. Maybe it eats plastic.Similarly, as an Engineering Student I've had it drilled into me that it just takes time for liquids to disperse and cells to grow, and the envelope of genetic engineering magic has crossed the line in this film. Much like the scene in FF5 where they drag the giant safe through the city, OMG that was the funniest thing I've ever seen in a film. But back to Prometheus. I don't want it to be funny and ridiculous, I really care about this Universe, and now this cool universe has had weird impossible things forced onto it. As far as plot points and the way I like to read into it, here goes: (SUPER SPOILERS) Sure after proving that we are incapable of selflessness, maybe the Engineers saw that and developed this black murky bio-weapon stuff that got into the boyfriend's drink. I can buy that. Then because they are so similar to us (genetically), oops somebody (mr. decapitated) got infected and then the bad bio-weapon snakes dispatched everybody except one survivor - almost required in these Alien movies, it seems. But why didn't he proceed directly to Earth? Who knows. We see Mr. Weiland wake him up, get slapped with his own Android's head, which was pretty nice, and then after its ship gets crashed, - for some reason it doesn't get another ship, instead it goes after Elizabeth. Hmmm. I think it should know better after all its buddies got stacked up dead due to free roaming monsters, but whatever. Now after getting your abdominal muscles sliced clear open, I'm almost completely sure you basically can't walk for a few weeks. Hmmm... Magic super-healing Elizabeth, whose womb was infected, but not anything else. Hmmm. But anyway I'm still in love with the series, and It's funny to think that the Alien came from human sperm infected with just a little bit of wormy badness, and that that baby was actually an overgrown boneless face hugger. I really wanted another hour of movie where Elizabeth gets to the other alien home world and the new xenomorph baddie impregnates another space jockey going off world in a spaceship. Also this movie used Geiger's art - was almost all just a pretext to use other artistic ideas of his. The big head on top of the pyramid was actually made for Dune, and the Alien mural was totally just like the baphomet painting. Anyway I'm going to see it a lot more times, but sure wish it could have been more plausible and complete.",8,1,5,9 June 2012
