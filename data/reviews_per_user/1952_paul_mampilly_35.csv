The Blair Witch Project," It is all in the imagination
","This movie is probably one of the most original movies that I have seen. It is about three adventrous students, who wants to investigate the infamous Blair Witch. But it all goes horribly wrong when strange and werid things happen. Strange formations of rocks and twigs and shadows of an unidentified being. The best thing about the movie is that is done in a Dogma style.So it seems to be so real. Also it gives the movie a more atmospheric feel to it. And it does not show what the Blair witch is. For all we know it could be a tabby cat or a sadistic maniac killer wanting to kill fresh faced students. This movie is a breath of fresh air to all the other type of 'slasher type' horror movies. Must watch movie",Null,1,2,16 October 2000
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Cinematic Equivalent Of Finding Out That Santa Claus Does Not Exist.
","I am sure that everyone in their young lives had that terrible moment of finding out that Father Christmas did not exist. Whether it was catching your Dad eating the cookies and milk while dressed up as St Nick, or just realizing that Playstation 2 you asked for ages still have not arrived. Either way, you felt betrayed in a way. A person you see as infallible, who brings joy and happiness in your life, seems to be nothing else but only human.That is how I felt when I saw Kill Bill Vol 2. Six years after Jackie Brown, Tarintino brings out Kill Bill Vol 1. After watching that movie, I knew that the genius was back in business. So knowing that Kill Bill Vol 2 was about to come out in a couple of months, I felt it was going to be more of the same. More mind blowing cinematic artistry, beautiful yet violent ballet of samurai swords and kung fu. As the months have passed by, my anticipations were rocketing sky high, and I could not wait to watch the movie, to see if my expectations were fulfilled.So April 23 come along, and my waiting is over. Yet my disappointment began Watch Out; Spoilers Ahead.The Bride now has only three on her 'to do in' list, since Copperhead was annihilated in a show down in leafy suburbia, and then the scalping of O-Ren Ishii in the climax of the previous movie. So who was next on the list? The next person to meet their maker is Bill's brother, Budd. After a few scenes, Budd seems to have the upper hand over the Bride, when she was buried alive in a coffin. During her limited time in the claustrophobic space, she begins to think about her training with the wise and knowledgeable Pai Mei. Due to this thinking, she used this inspiration to get out of a pure solid wood coffin and six feet of dirt, and seek pure retribution on Budd. After the death of Budd, via a venomous snake, Elle Driver was next to feel the wrath of the Bride. It was during this altercation between the two female assassins, it has been found out that Elle Driver had killed The Bride's Chinese mentor. Due to this bombshell, The Bride just goes ballistic on cyclopytic blonde killer and rips off her other eye and leaves her to be blind. The list whittles down to one person, who is the main character in both movies, and also the namesake in this film's title. However there is a major twist in this movie, and that is where my movie review is going to leave it.The actors and actresses were pretty good in their roles. I thought Uma Thurman was absolutely amazing as the Bride, and I though Chia Hui Liu was good as the wise but unintentionally funny Pai Mei. I thought Micheal Madsen was pretty good as Budd, though I did want to see him play a bigger role, since I think he is such a good actor. I think that Daryl Hannah will now be more remembered as the deadly assassin rather than the dippy mermaid in Splash! It was definitely good to see the legend of Kung Fu playing a meaty role.I thought that the casting role was amazing, however the ending and the story really disappointed me. I just thought that the ending was such a damp squib, since all that crazy kung fu actions and the decapitations of enemies, just leads to someone who simply dies with a complex karate move, which no one sees. I just found it really disappointing, however that was only the icing on the cake. How can both Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 were the same movie? I could not see how is connected at all. To be honest, it feels like it was a money making stunt done by Mr Tarintino. I just wish that the movie was immediately released straight after the first installment. It has been said that this film shows the signature note that is always scrawled upon most of Quentin movies, but I felt that this one was a bit of a let down.In conclusion, I felt this movie was such a disappointment. I wanted to like this movie so much, however I felt betrayed by one of my favorite directors. One quick word to the director; direct better movies and stop acting in mediocre ones.",6,0,2,30 April 2005
Scarface," Captialistic Views In 80's America
","While watching this movie in the year 2003, I cannot help feeling that this movie actually defined the mood of America in the eighties. The excess of drugs and money, the concept of one man for himself, succeeding the American Dream. However there is a major twist in this little fable of De Palma's; this man is not a honest working WASP, however an illegal Cuban immigrant who delves in the world of Cocaine.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!The plot is like this. Tony Montana arrives in America, with nothing more but the ideals of the American Dream, to succeed in life. However he does not have the patience to wait for that dream, but try to achieve it in the quickest way possible and the only way; through drugs. So he works for a drugs baron, keeping his loyalty to this one person. Yet his mind wonders, when the big man's girlfriend enters the scene. For Tony, he wants everything to work for himself; to get the girl, to get rich and to get powerful. However when this occured to him, via some violent and bloody battles, his grasp on power turned him slowly paranoid. First he does not trust his own friends, then his own girlfriend, and finally his own sister. It ends with his own demise, fighting a graphic fight scene on his own.The plot that I have written about is quite similar to Shakespeare's Richard III. The story of betrayal and paranoia in the bid to become powerful and rich seems like the parallel link in the two movies. The acting is quite surperb from those involved in the film, especially Al Pacino. His Cuban accent makes you believe that he is a native of Central America.
In conclusion, this movie is probably one of few that got the essence of the 80's to a tee and which would be shown throughout in history.",Null,0,1,23 November 2003
The Big Lebowski," White Russian Goodness
","It is the early 90's, George Bush Snr is attacking Iraq, and in the middle of Los Angeles, is a man named Jeff Lebowski aka the Dude(Bridges). The Dude's life consists of three main things, to get stoned, to drink White Russians and to go ten pin bowling. Life is simple for the Dude. Unforunately he is mistaken for the millionaire with the same name as him, by two thugs who relieved themseleves on The Dudes rug. After the Dude explained the situation to the Lebowski, he was thrown out and told to get a job. However Lebowski had changed his mind and ask the Dude to help him find his kidnapped trophy wife. With the help of his bowling sidekicks, which consist of a Vietnam veteran who sees everything in terms of war and battles, and a quiet person who is always told to shut up when he puts his opinion into the conversation, they go onto a weird and wacky adventure. It includes meetings with a bunch of German nilhilists, a feminist artist and an old fashion cowboy to name a few. I do not want to carry on with the plot of the movie otherwise it will consist with some spoilers, but my thought on the movie is this; probably one of the funniest stoner movies i have seen for a while. It would have to be said that the plot is flimsy, yet it is the characters invented by the Coen brothers are truly amazing. Jeff Bridges portrayal of the Dude is so great, that he will only be known as the Dude on his tombstone. John Goodman is fantastic as the vietnam vet Walter and Steve Buscemi is too funny as the straight guy, Donny. However there is one character who is truly funny, and that is the hispanic bowler Jesus Quintina. Unfornuately he is a bit player in this movie, but his lines are first class, no doubt about it.To conclude, this movie is a great movie, which should be watched by those who admire a good comedy and great characters. Also i would like to say that this movie is better than Fargo.",Null,0,2,11 October 2003
Fight Club," First Rule Is To Watch This Movie
","In a year, where The Matrix astounded and stretched our imaginations with amazing CGI graphics. Everyone was surprised by Bruce Willis' acting and the ending of The Sixth Sense. Sorry for a spoiler on a different movie, but that is a different matter altogether. This is a year, where the fan boys were not best pleased with Lucas' prequel to now the second greatest trilogy in cinematic history. This was a time when sequels were king, like Austin Powers; The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Toy Story 2, and mass hysteria was occurring on the Internet about some project of a witch.Yet out of the mass huddle of good movies, which one defines the film year of 1999? It could be said that the David Fincher 'Fight Club' could have clinched it for me. The plot outline is like thisPOSSIBLE SPOILERS.A disenchanted white collared office worker is having trouble going to sleep. After nights and nights of sleepless nights, he encounters a therapy group for those who suffer testicular cancer (in which he does not suffer from). By going to this group, he feels like he is being noticed, and it becomes more and more of an addiction. He attends groups, where he does not suffer a single virus, parasite, tumour or cancer, because he 'needs' it. However this all changed, when a woman called Marla also attended these therapy groups. She was also like the office worker, a 'faker'. This annoyed the office worker, since if he knows that there is a faker around, and then he cannot enjoy his time in the group and therefore cannot sleep. Through agreement with Marla, they get to go to the different groups, without actually seeing each other. Our main character usually travels across America, whether Fort Worth International in Dallas, or J.F.K in New York, he was always in a different place, trying to work out whether a car should be taken out of production (this is his actual job). On the way back from a job, he meets Tyler Durden; a suave cool snappy dresser, who's main job was making soaps. They become friends, and when the office worker's flat gets blown to smithereens by a faulty gas line, and then he stays over Tyler Durden's 'house' (more like a shack). However before this occurs, Tyler asks the office worker to do one favour, to punch him as hard as he can. This was the beginning of Fight Club; a club in which men literally beats the seven shades out of each other, and feels very good about it, almost enlightened in a way. There are several reasons why I like this movie a lot. My first reason is that it portrays itself as a cool movie, whether by its acting, the lines, the cinematography, or just he soundtrack. By watching this movie is like watching the Fonz in action, just coolness in motion. It has that aura which encapsulates me. Second reason, every actor in this movie deserved his or her place in this film. Brad Pitt's epitaph would say 'Here Lies Tyler Durden'. This must have been one of Norton's best movie roles, (the other one being American History X). Also it is good to see Helen Bonham Carter playing against her typecast, which is usually a prim English rose in a Merchant Ivory production. Meat Loaf also has to get a mention, for providing some humour with his prosthetic 'bitch tits'. I would have to say a funny moment. The cinematography is well done, especially the portrayal of the city as a dark, grimy underbelly of perverseness and violence. Fincher has shown this type of cinematography in Seven, which made me feel like I should have a shower straight after viewing the movie. It makes you feel you are watching these fights and acts firsthand. Finally, I would have to say that the soundtrack done by The Dust Brothers is exquisite. Each notes just accompanies the movie very well. To conclude, this is one of those movies which will define the millennium. A movie for the disenchanted men, almost like Nirvana for the working population. Watch this movie, and just marvel at how great the movie is.",Null,1,3,26 September 2004
Citizen Kane," A Good Movie, but not the Greatest
","As we are now three years into the new millenium, the movie industry has become all nostaglic about films, and wanted to put polls of the greatest movies ever made. Due to this, the Orson Welles movie 'Citzen Kane' has been rated highly in these charts. However does it really deserve the actual ratings it has been awarded?The plot is quite simple, and I must warn you that there is some spoilers involved in this review. The story of this movie is like so; A rich and influential man named Charles Foster Kane, is on his deathbed. He mutters his final words 'Rosebud' before kicking the bucket. Since this man was extremely rich, powerful and famous, his last quote has perplexed and bamboolzed the public and journalists alike. Was Rosebud a girl he knew, an associate he worked with? What does it actually mean?Due to this, an investigative journalist wanted to find out the meaning behind the word. The associates and the girlfriends that have been interviewed give a vivid story of the rags to riches of Mr Kane. From the humble beginnings of Charles as an orphan, who was looked after and raised up by a couple of merchant bankers. His fame and influence grew further and further as he began to become a news editor of the Inquirer, with promises of providing honesty and truth in ever print. However, as his influence grew, so did his ruthlessness. By the time he became a media bigwig and delving his hands into poltics, he began to lose his friends and associates. His love life did not suceed much either, with two divorces in his lifetime.I will choose to stop here, so that you can know what the ending of the movie is like. The acting is quite good, especially the main star, Orson Welles. His portyal of Charles Foster Kane was a gem to watch, even when the character grows older and older. Also the camerawork was groundbreaking at the time, which seems to be commonplace in movies nowadays.
However I did find some flaws about it. One flaw I found was this movie was a bit melodramatic. It seems that the actors were overacting and it did seem a bit annoying. Also I found that the movie was a bit too long and could have been edited a bit.In conclusion, this movie is a good movie, however I personally do not think it should have a big rating in the polls of the greatest films ever. To be honest, the only reason it is seen one of the greatest movies is due to the American influence, that this is one of the greatest movies, since it was American. If so, why is the Italian Job nor The Seventh Samurai are not voted as one the greatest movies ever.",Null,0,4,10 December 2003
Kickboxer," A movie for those who like the bargain basement deals.
","Before I start this movie review on Kickboxer, I would like to say that there would be no way in which I would watch a Van Damme movie, unless I was getting paid. However I had no money to go out, and so this movie was on the television. Another thing which would be mention is this, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!The story is like this; Man's brother is severely injured while fighting an evil kickboxer, and is not able to fight again. So it is up to the man to fight and gain his revenge on the one who has bought pain onto his brother. So he goes to a wise old man in the middle of nowhere, and is taught Mr Migayi style of training, like kick down bamboo trees down with bare feet. With the help of an old Vietnam vet, and a supposedly good looking Indo-chinese girl, this man goes and annhilates his brother's foe and therefore gains revenge. Sounds familar? That is because it is a basic rip off of The Karate Kid in terms of plot and in terms of the training up to the big fight. However the only difference between the two movies, is that Karate kid is much better. This movie was pretty bad, in terms of acting and in plot wise, however it did kind of held my attention. This is because I wanted to the good guy to win at the end. Somehow I feel that this is a typical Van Damme movie; lots of martial arts and lots of shots of him being half naked, which is not appealing to some people. If I would give it a rating i would give it two out of five, like all other Van Damme movies.",Null,0,4,15 November 2003
Happy Gilmore," 'Till The Night Closes In..........'. Sandler at his best.
","Golf, who would ever thought it would be funny at all. It is very easy to imagine what was going through the minds of Hollywood studio executives when someone said they have got an idea of a comedy which mainly involves golf. It is a narrow genre, however the last time such a movie has been made was Caddyshack. However since I have not seen it, Happy Gilmore is still going to be one of my favorite golf comedy movies.PLOT SPOILERS The plot is really simple. This rubbish wanna be ice hockey player has this phenonomenal talent for whacking a golf ball for more than 500 yards. He decides to take up golf, only for the fact that he needs to get money to pay off his grandmother's debts and get her house back. He sets the golfing world alight and is seen as a new and unconventional hero of the green. His temperament and his amazing drives brings in rowdy crowds, which does bring the game to disrepute but the ratings seems to hitting the roof all the time. Everyone seem to like him apart from the current golf champion, Shooter McGavin, who seems to be jealous from this newcomers popularity. So Shooter decides to get Happy to play him for the championships.This has to be Adam Sandler's best movie that he made. I thought that the Wedding Singer was his best, but that has to be given to this movie. He is so funny as Happy Gilmore, and I would have to say that the greatest scene, is when he starts singing Exile's song. It always cracks me up all the time I see that. The rest of the actors were OK, but to be honest this was Sandler's film. However, I would have to say Ben Stiller's cameo deserves another viewing, as he acted as the sadistic nursing home co worker. Julie Bowen does a moderate job as the love interest, and strangely enough looks like my old biology teacher, which is seriously weird but alluring nonetheless.Anyway I absolutely love this movie, and I have to say that I am a convert to Adam Sandler. However this does not mean that I just only like really stupid movies, but he is a great comic.",7,1,1,6 January 2005
X-Men," X-Cellent
","I just saw this movie a few days ago, and it had blown my mind away. It is such a cool movie, with some very good special effects and action sequences. Unlike any other Comic book made into an action flick, this had some depth and some kind of plot. I would not rated this movie for its plot , but for the special effects. Also some of the acting was good, especially from Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. But also there was some eye candy for the guys as well, such as Halle Berry, Rebbeca Romijn Stamos, and Famke Janssen. At the end of this movie, you are know that there will be a sequel to this, since they have left some holes in the story, such as will Wolverine find out about his past, or will Xavier and Magento fight it out for another day. You would just wait and see if the Hollywood producers will churned out a sequel for this movie.",Null,0,0,3 August 2000
Taxi Driver," A tale of Urban Isolation
","Everybody knows the line, 'You talking to me...........', because it seems one of the most famous lines in the history of the cinema, and it has every right to do. This movie is one of Martin Scorese's and Robert De Niro's best. I love, how a unexcepted heroes like Travis Bickle, comes to save the day. This is gives the viewer reason to believe that not every hero is clean cut and beautiful. The acting in this movie is amazing, especially Harvey Kietel as the Pimp, Jodie Foster as the child prostitute, and not forgetting Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle. This is a very powerful and moving movie.",9,0,0,24 May 2000
Full Metal Jacket," One Two Three Four I Love Marine Corps
","This movie was a good movie but would not rate it as one of the best movies I have seen. It is about the Vietnam War, and it does not glorify the war or the americans who fought in it. Instead it gives a grim portyal of war and destruction. This movie started out on a lighter note, when they show how the the trainee soldiers are coping under the drill sergeant, but there is always one that screws it up and that was private gomer Pyle. He was funny to watch and his expressions on his face to show his dumbness was funny. Also the drill sergeant who is a mean sadistic tyrant, makes me laugh when he belittles his platoon. However the laughter is soon over and then the grim reality begins.  I think that this movie was a little winded and long, but it was an ok movie.",Null,0,0,8 August 2000
Forrest Gump," The American Dream Lived Out Through The Eyes Of A Simple Man
","1994 was the year where being dumb ruled in the cinemas. Two out of ten top grossing movies of this year was about really idiotic or simple-minded people. The first one being the Jim Carrey vehicle 'Dumb And Dumber' and the other one being 'Forrest Gump' Though the first movie just made the viewers laugh with puerile humour, the latter movie provides a nostalgic travel through important events through history. It is the second movie that I am going to talk about in this review.Spoiler Plots Dead Ahead!!! The movie's story is really 'simple' to pardon the pun. It is about this character that has a very low I.Q., who while waiting for a bus, seems to tell his life experiences to folk next to him. It can be considered that this plot seems to be really going nowhere, however Forrest life is pretty unique. He seems to bumble into very important historical events in America's history without ever realising. These events last from the 1960's to the 1990's. He got to meet very famous people like J.F.K., Lyndon Johnson, Elvis, and John Lennon during his life. He fought in the Vietnam War, and made a million in the shrimp business and investing in some kind of fruit computer company. Even though he has experienced all these amazing events and people, the only thing that makes him going is his relentless love for Jenny, who is a childhood sweetheart who seems to push him away.Tom Hanks acting is absolutely amazing in this movie, and probably did his best role as the slow-witted Forrest Gump. He seems to play the everyday man who seems to be in extraordinary events in most of his movies, so therefore he is ideal in this movie. Sally Field plays one of the most understandable and lovable mothers who do not seem to be so saccharine sweet. Gary Sinse seems to play a really good role of Lt Dan Taylor, and I thought that Robin Wright Penn was pretty good as Jenny.The soundtrack was essential to this movie, since it seems to accentuate each scene with great poignancy. Also the music in this movie got me at least singing to it, though I was not even born in half the decades that the soundtrack had in it.It would have to be said that I actually liked this movie. I am not a big fan of nostalgic movies, since I don't usually seem to connect to such films like that. Also I am a bit of a cynic when it comes to such films like these. Yet this movie seems to hit a a nerve with me and I really enjoyed it and makes me escape to such a fantasy life like Forrest Gump. Also this movie seem to show some social undertones, such as the constant aftermath of Vietnam, (nowadays this would be Gulf War II), the fighting against racism, (befriending Bubba during such racial tensions), and sexual and physical mistreatments of women (shown many times with Jenny). A final point to say is that in this movie, the portrayal is that Mr Gump is seen as a stupid person. However, it is the line which portrays the irony in this movie, 'Stupid Is As Stupid Does'.It shows the rest of the people in this movie who seems to act out this line, such as Jenny who seems to be in a constant spiral downwards into hedonism and drugs, and Lt. Dan who seems to have gone mad when he lost his legs. The movie shows that Gump only views the world in simple terms and his morals are never waivered when everyone else's are flipping back and forth over the blurry line of right and wrong.In conclusion, I think this is one of the most heart warming movies I have ever seen and it is up there with 'It's A Wonderful Life' sentimentality with dark overtones. However I am still a cynic when it comes to movies.",8,1,2,31 January 2005

A young teenager girl being looked after by her neighbour hitman, since her whole family is completely massacred by a bent copper.It sounded like it was going to be a buddy movie, one of those where everyone will live very happily. But when I watch this, I was so wrong. It is one of those movies which will always remain as one of my favorites, ranked with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This movie is easily intertwined both funny scenes between the girl and the hitman, the graphic violence, and the great acting by Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman and producd with one the finest movies ever.",Null,1,2,29 October 2000
The Village," A Twist Too Far.
","Ever since Haley Joel Osment uttered the words 'I see dead people' in Sixth Sense, it catapulted the Indian born director M Night Shyamalan into mainstream Hollywood. His movies has been blockbuster successes, with the use of paranormal and supernatural going ons in each one of them. It starts off with ghosts in 'The Sixth Sense', superhero powers in 'Unbreakable' and extra terrestials in 'Signs'. However it is not this that had made him one of the influentical directors of modern day cinema. It is the use of the unbelievable twist, in which catches the audience unawares. This latter ingredient in his movies can be a serious hindrance for him, since he is continuously will be known as the 'twist doctor', and the audiences will be constantly trying to anticipate the massive twist in the movie.In 'The Village', the M Night ingredients are all there. The story is set in quiet isolated village in the olden times. It seems too idyllic, yet a sinister presence is keeping the villagers in their town. It seems that in the woods, which is opposite the village, lives evil monsters which maim and kill livestock and people who angers them. The villagers understood this and never set foot into the woods, in fear of these beasts. However one day, this all changes when one brave fellow, Lucius Hunt feeling that his curiosity has to be satisfied and ventures into the woods. This seems to be a bad idea, since the monsters causes havoc and places fear into the villagers, by skinning some livestock and hanging the carcasses from the porches. This changes the future of the village forever. With this story in the forefront, there is a romantic sub plot developing. This includes a love triangle between Lucius Hunt (Phoenix), the partially sighted Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) and the mentally unstable Noah Percy (Adrien Brody).The actors in this movie are quite good, especially Howard's portrayal of Ivy, and Phoenix's of Lucius. There are good support roles by William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, and not forgetting Adrien Brody. The cinematography is so atmospheric that you could feel the fallen leaves rustling underneath, as you first enter the woods. You could really feel that you were there.Spoilers AheadNow this is where my criticisms come into this movie review. I felt like that the story was too long and very plodding. Some people like stories to go slow, so that the characters can be developed, but I could not see it. It was going in such a slow pace, that a Skoda could have beaten it in speed. Also there were too many twists in the movie. With the movie being too slow, it is just getting boring after a while, even when you were meant to be surprised by the twist(s).I counted three and to be honest, the final one seemed so unbelievable that i felt like M Night had taken the easy route out of the movie. To be honest, I wish he had a better ending.In conclusion, if you have time to see a beautifully shot movie with good acting, but not the greatest of stories, then this is the one for you. But remember, anything that is a 12a is not a horror. Just look at The Haunting with Zeta Jones",Null,0,0,22 August 2004

","I watched this movie straight after the Oscars, just to see why this movie was such a white wash on the awards. Then I realised when I watched this movie. This movie gives such a good portrayl on Suburban life, and how the nuclear family can just sometimes be cracked and bruised. The acting from Kevin Spacey was absoultely brillant, as the supressed husband and father who wants to change completely while he hits the mid-life crisis. Annette Bening is pretty good, and should have won an oscar for her role as the wife , who is trying to keep her family as normal and successful as possible. Thora Birch and Mena Suravi play the stereotypical teenagers, but without so much cliches, unlike other movies. Thora plays an outsider in school, an angry and frustated teenager who believes that her family is interfering into her life. Mena on the other hand, plays a popular and sexy teenager who always brags about who she had sex with. There are so many good characters in this movie and it is woven with such a good story and brilliant acting, this movie deserves the oscars that it got",Null,0,0,3 August 2000

It is about a failed puppeter who finds a porthole into the famous John Malkovich's head.

Spirited Away," Can Easily Beat Disney In Their Own Game
","As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!However there is no point of handing out the superlatives to a movie, without explaining what the movie is all about. In a nutshell, the movie is about a ten year old girl who is travels to a strange yet enchanting world, after her parents were morphed into pigs. This change of shape was produced by the evil witch, Yubaba, an nasty sorceress who rules over this paralell universe. To avoid detection, the ten year old girl, Chihiro has to work for Yubaba in her bath house. This is where she meets all kind of strange and wonderful characters, like the half man half spider Kamaiji, the mysterious little boy, Haku and many other characters. Though Chihiro had met all these people, her only wish is to go home and turn her parents back to their normal human selves. Watching this movie, has made me wonder why is this feature shown in very small arthouse cinemas and it is on pirate DVDs, when it should be easily shown on the multiplex cinemas. This is a truly amazing movie, whereby the whole story, transports oneself to their earlier childhood. I know that happened to me. Also the movie's animation was totally amazing, in ways that Pixar and Dreamworks would just die for. A good example of this is the flower scene. In conclusion, everyone should watch this movie, whether young or old, japanese or any other nationality, because at the end of the day, this will show you emotions that any other animations will not give you the chance to show.",10,25,44,27 September 2003

I am very surpised that Kevin Spacey did not get an Oscar for his role as Verbal. Also I love the story. It is unbelievable , and I can see why it is  a cult hit to all the movie buffs around the world. Finally, this movie has more twists and turns than a corkscrew in a rollercoaster.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Homage to martial arts movies, Tarantino Style.
","After waiting six years since his last piece of cinematic genius, Mr Tarantino has come back to the limelight with a bang and some arterial spurts. It is seemed like the director had just wanted to become the prodigal son, walking the Earth and to rediscover himself, before allowing himself again to be loved by the mainstream again. However this time, he is does not have any witty lines amongst a couple of gangsters, but a bunch of kick ass martial arts ladies kicking the crap out of each other. A kinda of anti Charlie Angels, (a sense of irony there, since Lucy Liu also stars in this movie.)Anyway, I digress and I would like to explain the concept of the movie. Before then, I would like to warn; POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADIt starts off with a black and white close up of The Bride (Uma Thurman) left almost to die. Off screen, you hear Bill (the mysterious boss of assassination gang DIVAS) trying to justify his actions upon her, before placing a bullet in her head. This sets you off for the big rollercoaster ride. The Bride awakes from a four year coma, and boy is she wrathful for what has happened, and so she tries to seek revenge. The first person that she gets medival is Copperhead, who is an ex DIVAS assassin who was involved for the near death of The Bride. Enter a superb knife duel/ bitch fight set amongst the leafy surburbs of California. After annihililating her opponent in front of Copperhead's pre school daughter, The Bride makes a move to Toyko to seek and hunt down the next on her list, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). The movie then turns into first how the O-Ren has become what she has become, in a style of Japanese anime. Afterwards, it shows how the Bride seeks help from the old but wise master Harroti Hanzo (the legendary Japanese actor Sonny Chiba) by obtaining a hand made sword by the man himself. After this, it is all fun and games martial arts style. Violence come thick and fast like blood spurting out of a freshly severed head, (which happens many a time in this movie, but this is a Tarintino movie)I will not try to give too much away, which at this moment of time is gonna be quite hard. However, from what you have read from this review I would hope that you would see this movie. The acting in this movie is not thespian style acting and the dialogue is not all to what Tarintino can give, but it is the martial arts scenes and the visual medley of cinematic art, in which would should be shown to budding film students and veterans alike. This movie would have to be said to be the greatest Westernised martial arts movies (if not the most violent) and it should be watched by anyone who loves a good cinematic experience. That includes all the Daily Mail readers.

From Dusk Till Dawn," Like Marmite, you love it or hate it.
","Just to make clear to anyone who has not heard of marmite, it is a sandwich spread which tastes like an ashtray, hence my hatred for marmite. Now comparing Marmite to this movie has its reasons. Having read the reviews on this movie, it seems that half of you love the movie and the other half despises this movie. I have to agree with the latter half.
This movie is just a waste of time, space and money. The point of having two directors in a movie is to compliment each other, but watching this film, the differences are glaring and annoying. I was appalled at Tarintino's involvement in this movie. After making some timeless classics, like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, he lands a big flop like this. Harvey Kietel, George Clooney and Juliette Lewis should have washed their hands at this movie. The only saving grace of this movie, is the seductive strip by the volputous Salma Hayek. The beginning started of like it would be a great movie. Two psychotic brothers on a killing spree, kidnaps a family and travels to Mexico. From this point onwards the movie plummets like the shares in Railtrack. They go into a stripclub, where surpisingly enough, it is a hideout of the beloved creatures of the night,Vampires. Except gore gore gore and of course not forgetting gore. Boring, tedious and really could have done better.",Null,0,0,26 October 2001
Men in Black," Great special effects
","This movie is just another sci fi. Great Special effects, good actors, but flimsy plot and predictable ending. Will Smith is still usual self, wise cracking, cool and giving some terrible one liners. But dont worry about this, it is not a movie that you should use your brain for. Instead leave it at home and take the flow of this movie.",Null,0,0,22 October 2000
There's Something About Mary," Pushing the boundaries of taste
","This movie is probably one of the funniest yet sometimes tasteless movies I have seen. It is about a man who wants to find his long lost sweetheart, so he hires a private dick to help him find her. This is when the real fun starts.  Flying dogs, and male sexual organs getting stuck in zippers,only to name a few.As I said this is pushing the boundaries of taste in this the movie. Cameron Diaz is very good as Mary, Matt Dillion as Pat and the funniest is Ben Stiller as the hapless Ted. If you get easily offended then you should get a nice romantic movie instead but if you like schoolboy humour and toilet jokes then this is the one for you.",Null,0,0,22 October 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Truly a classic which will run for ages.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSBefore I write my review, I have to say that my previous entry on the movie did not do enough justice and did not contain sufficient superlatives to express the greatness of this film. People who maybe reading this review, may think that i am going over the top about placing this movie as the greatest ever made, but i do have my reasons.The story itself is a basic heist movie, where the event goes horribly wrong, and the participants doubt and mistrust each other. However what differs this movie, to other types of 'heists gone wrong' is that the actual bank robbery event is not shown,  therefore it shows that the viewers would use their imagination to think up the situation. Many people have claimed that this movie has heavily relied on other movies, such as the Killing, i would say that the story reminds me of a Shakespearian tradegy.
The actors in this movie were to say were truly an amazing ensemble of unknown gems and forgotten stars. Harvey Keitel (Taxi Driver) was amazing as the leader of the colour coded gang, who tries to make sense of what happened within the day. Micheal Madsen was sinsterly good at portraying the psychotic sadist Mr Blonde. Steve Buscemi fitted into the character, Mr Pink, like a glove. Tim Roth was outstanding as a rookie gangster Mr Orange with a hidden agenda. However the acting goes together with the visual script used in the movie. It is packed with so much popular culture reference, such as the Like a Virgin arguement at the beginning. Also the soundtrack in this movie is complimentary, with Stuck In The Middle Of You for the standout torture scene. A very surreal moment!To conclude, i would like to say that this movie should be watched by true movie buffs and fans, since it is a great flim, which should be watched through the ages.",9,0,1,30 July 2003
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's Masterpiece
","Once again, Quentin Tarantino has made a movie which would influnence and inspire other directors, as well as making a cult status for himself.
Before watching this movie, I thought that Reservoir Dogs was the best movie ever, but I was so wrong.This movie is absolutely amazing. His choice of actors and actresses had really made this movie what it is, especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. The storyline may seem confusing at first, but Tarantino gathers up the loose ends and ties it up like a true professinal director does. The soundtrack is so catchy, and its balance of violence and good lines made this movie enjoyable. Also I have to say that this movie has reserructed John Travolta's and Bruce Willis's careers.This movie is a must see, so GO AND SEE IT.",9,0,0,14 May 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A British version of Pulp Fiction
","When I saw this movie, i could see where Guy Ritchie got his inspiration. He must have been watching Pulp Fiction. Evidence for this comparsion are;1) The cast is male dominated (excluding Tanya, the poker player, Gloria, the stoned woman , and the stripper). In Pulp Fiction, there is only Mia, Fabian and Honey Bunny as the female roles.   2)Its common use of the swear word f**k. It was used so much, that is could be out of fashion. Just like a typical Tarantino movie.
3) It is about lowlifes and criminals. It is like his usual films, such as Vincent Vega and Jules Winnefeld4) The script is full of wit and black humour. Cheeseburger scene from Pulp Fiction is a good example. 5) Finally both stories are complex and hard to explain, but it is easily intertwined to at the end. The story is about four blokes who are sometimes slighty on the wrong side of the law. They chip in 25,000 pounds each, for an illegal game of poker. Ed, the card shark from the gang, believes that he will easily win the game. However, what he does not realise is that the card game is rigged. Once he loses the card game, he is threatened to get the money for at least a week, or him and his gangs will face dire consequences. This is the start of a very funny and great movie about the British Underworld of gangsters. Jason Statham, Nick Moran, Dexter Fletcher and Jason Flemying is great as the four unlucky rogues. Everyone keeps on going about the hard nut Vinnie Jones, but the limelight should be given to Vaz Blackwood. He plays Rory Breaker, and he was funny and amazing. Watch this movie and you will fooking enjoy it. KNOW WHAT I MEAN?!",Null,0,3,1 November 2001
Rocky III," A good movie
","I have not seen the first two installments of Rocky, but I seem to get the jist of the story. It is just a boxer who wants to be a world champion and he does but loses it, and has to regain it. It is not much of a plot, and some of the acting is too great either, however you got to love Mr T and his lines. It is just the same as he does in the A-Team. Not the greatest of movies but a good laugh, when it should not be",Null,0,0,16 June 2000
Shrek," On par with Toy Story and A Bug's Life.
","Ever since the beloved Simpsons have hit our screens, cartoons have been more and more satirical. Shrek is no expection. The plot could have come from any Brothers Grimm or any other story teller. Princess is trapped in a castle and someone has to rescue her, however this someone is an ogre. He does not save the princess out of love or for courage, but to get rid of extradicted fairy tale characthers from his homely swamp. These characthers are escaping from the evil and height challenged lord. With the help of a street wise donkey, who will not take no as an answer, they head for their adventure. Accept funny one liners, brillant satire and piss takes of famous stories and paroides of post modern culture. This is a funny movie, with brillant stars voicing these characters.8/10",Null,0,1,30 July 2001
Bruce Almighty," Below par movie on the discussion of God
","Possible SPOILERS AHEADLet me make this clear to people, i am not a hater of Jim Carrey movies. In fact i believe that all his movies provide a unique slapstick, rubbery face humour which would be found humourous by many people. However i do believe that this movie, was less about the concept of exsistence of god, but more of how many cheap gags, and references to previous Jim Carrey movies, like the Ace Ventura and Truman Show. Let us see if you can find itThe concept of the movie is that an average person who has lost the faith with God, after a severe unlucky day. After his constant whinning to God, he is given by divine right, the chance to the Almighty himself. After obtaining these powers, he uses them for his own purposes, like to get the top job, and to make his wife's assets bigger. However he realises that this is not what God's job really is, and then that is where the chaos really starts.The acting is OK from Jim Carrey, being the normal dude playing God. Jennifer Aniston was no different from this role in this movie and in her famous series 'Friends'. Morgan Freeman's acting was not really stretched to greater heights in this movie.So in conclusion, i would say that is movie is a bit below par. A movie where the brain does not have to be there to enjoy it. I do recommend other movies in such a genre which is better than this film; Dogma and The Life Of Brian",Null,0,0,7 August 2003
Trainspotting," Choose Life, Choose Watching this movie
","I have to say that this is one of the finest post 70's British movies I have ever seen. This is rated with Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, for its humour, and Nil By Mouth for its gritness.The casting is brillant especially, Begbie (Robert Caryle) and Renton (Ewan Mcgregor). The script is funny at times and harrowing at others. The soundtrack to this is very good, especially 'Lust for Life' by Iggy Pop, and 'Born Slippy' by Underworld. This movie will take you onto a big high but will give you a dark and daunting look at drugsAs I said ' Choose Life, Choose Trainspotting'",7,0,1,23 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," A top movie
","This movie is a brillant movie which deserved all the praise that it got. The story is about a boy who keeps seeing ghosts. So he goes and see a child psychologist. In this he seems to be confront his fear of these ghosts and seem to live a normal live at the end. But this is not another soppy dramatic 'live all happily together' movie. Instead this movie is full of scares and spooks, but it is not this that amazes the viewers. Instead it is the ending which completely catches people off guard. The ending is like a 'Usual Suspects' type of ending, thinking that it is going somewhere, but instead it takes a sharp turn. This is probably a breath of fresh air for Bruce Willis, who is remembered for his action movies. But the real gem in this movie is Haley Joel Osment who plays the child who sees ghosts. Absolutely amazing!",10,0,0,20 October 2000
The Matrix," One of the best sci-fi movies ever!!!!!
","Ever felt that the world we live in is not the real world, but instead a some sort of dream or a sophicasted sort of computer program? If you said yes a few years ago, you would be seen as a crazy madman with a stupid conspircary theory. However when you watch the Matrix, it makes you wonder if we are all alive or not. It is about a computer hacker called Neo who is asked to joined a viligante group out to save the human race from destruction. Neo escapes the world he believes that he is in, and ends up in a post apocalpytic future. Sounds like you normal run of the mill sci fi but you would be wrong. The action sequences are absolutely fantastic especially when Neo is fighting his mentor Morpheus. It reminds me so much of the old kung fu movies, I was expecting some very dodgy dubbing. The acting was ok,but there was some glimmer of great acting especially from Mr Fishburne. However it is the special effects that takes the audience breath away. That is what makes this movie so special. The special effect of the Bullet Time, (this is where the action stops but the whole thing relvoles to get another view of it), is so cool. I have to take my hat off and say this is a brillant movie, and should be watched by anyone from Conspricay Theorists, Sci Fi Buffs and even the people who does not like sci fi at all. 10/10",Null,0,0,26 November 2000
Jackie Brown," Dont make me put my foot in your ass
","Possible SPOILERS AheadAs the release of the highly anticipated Kill Bill is looming nearby, I thought it would be a good idea to watch Jackie Brown, so that i have watched his trilogy.And what a good idea that was! In a nutshell, the story is about this air stewardess setting her revenge on a small time arms dealer, who placed her into jail. Her method of revenge is to steal the dealer's money, but being under parole, she comes off with a very clever plan. It could be said that the plot is nothing special, and it could be said that is right. However it is how Mr Tarintino changes the simple plot to a labyrinth of sub plots and explaining the story in unchronlogical order which makes it intriguing to watch.It is absolutely brillant to see that Pam Grier, the queen of blaxploitation movies, is being ressurected for such a good movie. Also I would have to say that she is looking fine for age as well. Samuel L Jackson is just enthralling as Ordell Robbie, the arms dealer, and like in Pulp Fiction, he seems to get the greatest lines. Robert De Niro was good as Louis Gara, Ordell's aging partner in crime, who just got out of jail. Bridget Fonda was only there for eye candy and was not involved as much as should have been. Chris Tucker and Micheal Keaton were good in bit part roles in the film.In conclusion, it would have to be said that though this does not have Tarintino signature all over the movie, it still has inklings of Quentin's genius inside the movie. The complex plot and the slick gun fire like dialogue, makes you know that you are watching Quentin's movie.",Null,0,1,15 October 2003
True Romance," Tarantinos romantic story with the unnecessary Hollywood gloss.
","Ever since I saw the indie classic `Reservoir Dogs', it felt like it was my mission to watch all the movies which was directed or written by the former video clerk. I have seen the mutterings of having cheeseburgers for breakfast in Pulp Fiction, the arterial spurts of a freshly chopped arm in Kill Bill Volume I, the double crossings of an air stewardess in Jackie Brown and the crazy obsession with celebrities in Natural Born Killers. So having read recently that QTs first major transcript was not Reservoir Dogs, but a movie I have not seen called True Romance. Basically I heard that this film was written way before the ear cutting classic. Sorry about the small story about the past works of one of the most influential directors of our time, but it helps me to be able to write this movie review.
POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWe should start this review at the only place it should begin, which is at the start. The film starts of with a chance meeting between a call girl named Alabama and an Elvis fanatic called Clarence during a martial arts extravaganza in a seedy cinema. During the usual getting to know chit chat, it seems that they have truly fallen in love, and before long they get married. One day, Clarence finds out that Alabama has a pimp, who was a nasty piece of work. With this knowledge, Clarence anger rises and silently swears to the King of Pop that he will seek vengeance on the prostitute pusher. After eliminating this person, Clarence picks up a bag, assuming that it was his wife's belongings. Instead it turns out to be a large stash of uncut cocaine. His plan was to sell this whole amount of cocaine to a big Hollywood producer to make a tidy amount of money. However another element joins into the equation, such as a sadistic mob who are pretty irate about their cocaine being stolen and would do anything to get it back. That is where the real fun starts in this movie, with the gangsters being on the tails of this movie's Bonnie and Clyde. The casting ensemble for this movie is filled with some established actors as well as some up and coming actors who will become A-listed players. (Look at Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson for their bit parts in this movie) Christian Slater's character was believable, and he did have some aspects to make himself cool, especially liking Kung Fu movies and The King himself. Patricia Arquette played her character of Alabama, with some sexiness yet with simple and innocent way about it. Christopher Walkens made his role his own, by playing the stony face, sadistic Sicilian gangster. Dennis Hopper did do a good job on playing a simple living semi retired cop, who is the father of Clarence. However I do have to say that my favourite character in this movie was Bronson Pinchot's weasely, boot licking and cowardly portrayal of Elliot. This is probably one of his best acting screen time ever. Also, I do not want to forget the concept of Val Kilmer playing the King himself. It is a good thing that you do not see the King himself, but only his tacky gold suit, otherwise you would think that he would look nothing like Elvis.As the review title says, this movie does not go without any flaws at all. The first flaw is the directing. Tony Scott did a reasonably good job in the directing, yet I still felt that it was out of place with the dialogue given by Tarintino. Once again, I would have to say sorry about the biasness towards Quentin, but if he was behind the camera in this movie, it would have turn into a much better picture. Personally I did not like the Hollywood gloss given over the movie. It just seems too fake, even though there were visions of Elvis taking to this guy, and a gratitous amounts of violence. Also another thing I did not like, is the concept of Gary Oldman playing Drexel. To me it just does not make sense to get a white guy to play a Rastafarian. Would it not have been easier to have gotten a black guy to play this role. Sorry to have gone Spike Lee on all you readers, but I had to say what I had to say. This does not mean that Gary Oldman acting was rubbish in this movie, but it would have been better that this character was played by an Afro Carribean origin. To conclude, I do believe that this movie is very enjoyable, and great to watch, especially seeing cameos of soon to be big Hollywood players (Samuel L Jackson and Brad Pitt). Watch it if you like good crime movies with witty dialogue.",Null,2,4,11 February 2004

However when I saw the Wedding Singer, I might have missed a decade in which I would have loved. This movie was very funny and the soundtrack was brillant.

","This movie is just a masterpiece on its own, because for two reasons. One, it has some amazing special effects which are pretty good in the time it was made. Also this movie is a funny sci fi which is rarely seen in any other type of movie like this. Micheal J. Fox does a brillant job of playing,Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd cracks me up with his characther, Dr Emmet Brown. This movie is good at it time and will always be remembered for generations to come.",Null,0,1,16 September 2000
