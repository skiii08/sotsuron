The Blair Witch Project," Great, but not THAT scary. **CONTAINS MILD SPOILER**
","While I did think that the Blair Witch Project was a very goodmovie, I didn't think it was overall as scary as all the reviewshad said.  Granted, it had its moments of undeniable terror,such as the scene in the tent when a mysterious force beganpounding on the tent, and in the background you could hearchildren laughing and singing.  I liked the fact that it had amildly humerous tone to it, like Mike's comment about redneckswhen the trio discovered the stick figures in the t",Null,0,1,5 September 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Wow.
","Without a doubt, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the absolute best movies that I have ever seen.  Seeing a movie with characters that seem so true to life that I could actually care for them was a rare and very welcome experience for me.  The film was made in such a way that you didn't really know how it was going to end, but what an ending indeed.  I thought it was one of the most rewarding endings to a movie in recent history. I don't know how this movie was passed up for an Academy Award for best picture, or at least a nomination, amazes me.  Well deserving of its rank of #4 in the top 250 movies of all time.",10,0,0,4 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Pretty cool, but definately could've been better...
","I think that The Sixth Sense had many redeeming qualities, starting with strong performances by both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.  I think that the end twist with Bruce Willis's character was a great idea, and unpredictable.  I also liked the particular interaction that Osment's character had with the ghosts.  What I didn't like was that I don't think it was developed enough.  Director m. Night Shyalaman was onto two very interesting plot elements, and if they had been developed a bit more, this film would have been much better.",6,0,0,3 September 1999
