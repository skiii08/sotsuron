Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As for the acting
","Having seen the Phantom Menace 15 times since it's release, and having been entertained slightly more, each and every time, I feel that I can reasonably argue that Episode I is the best Star Wars film currently available. The special effects are literally out of this world, and George Lucas' return to directing is both welcome and surprising: Surprising in that, after such a long layoff, his techniques and cuts are still sharp. The script flows across the screen at a clip that can easily keep pace with the original classic trilogy, and it has an added bonus. Humor. This is the funniest Star Wars movie as well. As for the acting; hmm... let's think about this. Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor, or Harrison, Mark and Carrie. No disrespect to the latter three (who are all great talents) but Neeson is an A-list actor, who's unflappable calm is the glue throughout the film. McGregor is genuinely sweet as Obiwan and if anyone at the age of 16 can claim the same maturity and poise as Portman, I salute you. Overall, The Phantom Menace is exactly what it should be, a fun film, an adventure of cinema escape, in the Lucas tradition, which only the master himself can duplicate.And for anyone that hasn't seen the lightsaber duel between Qui Gon, Obiwan and Darth Maul. Go. Now! That battle is heartpounding, easily the most intense sequence in the entire saga and my favorite moment in the history of cinema.",10,0,0,27 May 1999
