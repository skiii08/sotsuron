Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A lot better than the critics said it was
","I remember walking out of the theater 2 years ago after having seen this, and thinking 'That was a damned good movie, I sure got my money's worth!' Well, didn't take long to find out not everyone shared my sentiments. I guess it was to be expected. After all the hype and the waiting, the fans wanted nothing less than for George Lucas to smash a grand slam homer right out of the park, so when instead he hit a solid triple, a lot of people felt cheated and let down, and so they focused on what they didn't get more than on what was delivered.Which is a shame. Phantom Menace is a fine film in its own rights. In part, some of the complaints were because it was different from the others. Most notably, the comradeship of familiar characters was missing, the interplay between the heroes, heroines and sidekicks as they grew to trust each other and deal with their various character traits as they bounced from one close call to the next. There was no romance to speak of (unlike the great Han Solo/Princess Leia exchanges) nor was there much humor (as in the interplay between Chewbacca and the two droids) and of course the central character is one we all know will soon transform into the evil villain of the first trilogy. In short, it simply doesn't have a lot of the key elements that everyone loved from the earlier films.But so what? Like I said, this one is different, and should be judged on its own merits. What is good about this film? For starters, the awesome effects. Let's face it, that's what MADE the Star Wars franchise, lose them, and you've just got a pretty decent space fairy tale. There's some really cool concepts, too, I especially liked the various types of Battle Droids, and would not be surprised to see this idea become reality in our own military some time in the near future. Also, you've got a deeper, darker, more serious mood. There's not too much in the way of yuks and joking around because anyone with vision can see that this particular Galaxy is headed for serious trouble. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala, who, IMHO, is an even better female lead than Carrie Fisher. She's got the same strength of character, only in a different guise. Instead of a feisty, resourceful rebel Princess, she, despite being only 18 or so, leads with great dignity and poise. Darth Maul is another great character, the only downside is he wasn't given more screen time. Young Annakin Skywalker comes off just as we'd expect, he's a slave, but clearly destined to move on to much bigger things. We are left wondering just how it is this budding Jedi ends up making the choice to side with evil, not to mention how he will interact with his future wife and son. We are left hanging deliciously, wondering just what Episode Two will serve up. As for the bad, well, basically it can be summed up in three words  Jar Jar Binks. Rarely has a more annoying and useless character been given so much screen time in a major movie. He's funny .. for maybe a minute or two. Then he should have been given the boot. Yet he seems to be onscreen almost as much as Luke in the original! What on Earth for? He brings nothing to the film to justify being so prominent. Further, he turns an otherwise spectacular final battle scene into a 3 Stooges style comic farce in which he blunders about the battlefield taking out the enemy through sheer incompetence and dumb luck (maybe I should change the comic reference to Gomer Pyle). Anyway, if ever this film is subject to digital editing, Jar Jar should be `erased' from every scene where it is practical to do so. On a more minor note, I was less impressed than most by the Pod Race. Sure, it was cool but so is an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo. And both are more a case of artistic showing off than anything else. The Pod Race was special effects for its own sake, and didn't really add anything of importance to the movie.
But, other than that, this was definitely a far better than average film. It's just too bad that didn't live up to public expectations that were, quite honestly, so high as to be nearly impossible for mere mortal man to achieve.",Null,1,2,16 October 2001
Gravity," Great visuals, okay plot
","GravityI just watched this on my computer. It was, in fact, my first ever downloaded movie from the Internet. I guess this is now the wave of the future, what with Blockbuster being out of business, though I will still miss going to the video store and browsing through thousands of movie selections, often not having a clue in advance as to what movie I was going to rent. Anyway, on to the movie. Visually, it's great, and probably its best feature by far. The effects are so good you don't even notice they're effects, it looks like they actually shot this movie in real outer space. As for the rest? The best I can say is the story is competent. For those who don't know, it's about two people stranded in space after debris from several exploded satellites has taken out their space shuttle (didn't the filmmakers know the Shuttle is now retired?). They are literally marooned with just their space suits for protection. The question then is: can they get to a nearby space station (in this case, Chinese) in order to find a capsule that can take them safely back to Earth? The plot makes some technical errors, but you can mostly ignore those and just enjoy the drama and the great visuals. There's no need to spoil the plot, since there isn't much of one. Either they get back to Earth or they don't. Sandra Bullock does, I think, a pretty decent job, although she really doesn't come across as a real astronaut but more like a Damsel in Distress set in space. Although she's competent enough when she has to be, she's much too emotional most of the time to look like someone who's gone through the rigorous training and psychological screening given to real astronauts. And Clooney isn't really acting at all, he's just playing himself (wise cracking, obviously thinks he's God's gift to all women, etc.) only he's doing it in a space suit.This has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Will it win? Should it win? On the first, I doubt it, since space/Sci-Fi movies almost never win Best Picture. Stanley Kubrick's 2001 didn't (and it's much better than this film) nor did any of the Star Wars flicks. Should it win? Probably not. The amazingly lifelike visuals (again, they really look like they're in space, but then, so did most of 2001 and that was filmed in 1968) simply can't make up for a pedestrian plot. 7/10 mainly for the amazing visual effects.",7,0,1,28 February 2014
Se7en," Disgusting & morally vacant 2/10
","**CONTAINS SPOILERS**
Perhaps it's the timing. Three weeks ago I might have reacted differently to this movie. But right now I just have little tolerance for the way it takes genuine horror and evil and creates a stylish, but ultimately empty, Hollywood package out of it. This film is about a sadistic killer who is choosing his victims and methods of death based on the seven deadly sins (hence the title of the movie). On his trail are two detectives, a young hotshot named David Mills (Brad Pitt) and a senior Homicide Lieutenant, William Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) who has become cynical almost to the point of burnout. The murders are carried out with extreme cruelty, although the violence is not actually shown being committed, it is depicted quite graphically by what the two men discover at each crime scene, as well as in the various photos, coroner's reports, etc., that they examine. To be blunt, this is NOT for the squeamish, in fact, I'm surprised this film didn't get an NC-17 rating. Anyway, the bodies pile up, and despite their best efforts (including a very close encounter by Mills), the killer, known only as `John Doe', remains at large. In fact, we don't even see him at all until halfway through the film, and we don't see him close up until near the end. Which is, basically, where this otherwise well crafted film falls apart. At this point, five victims have already been discovered. In a strange plot twist, Mr. Doe turns himself in, them makes a bizarre offer. In return for a full confession, he requests the two detectives accompany him, alone and unarmed, so he can show them the final two victims. Obviously he has something really shocking planned as his grand finale, and, given his extremely high level of intelligence shown to date, only a fool would accept such a proposal at face value. Yet accepted it is, and all three men end up alone in the desert, the scene set for the final horror.   (Warning: BIG spoiler ahead)On the drive out, Doe has been taunting Mills relentlessly, setting up the big showdown in which Somerset is handed a package containing the severed head of Mills' wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. At this point, Doe springs the trap. With a sneer, he informs Mills that the head represents the sin of envy, namely the killer's envy of Mills' heretofore charmed life. Of course, the sinner will pay for his sin, and in the process bring down the final victim, Mills himself, whose sin is wrath. Somerset, who understands the situation fully as soon as he opens the box, tries in vain to prevent what he knows is inevitable. Mills struggles to fight off his natural desire to kill Doe, knowing if he does, the killer wins his twisted game, but in the end he cannot help it. The film ends with Mills being driven off, presumably in handcuffs, in the back of a squad car. No matter what happens to him now, his life has been utterly destroyed. Much as with the suicide bombers of September 11th, we are left with the sense of the sneering triumph of evil over good, of a twisted life of hate given solely for the purpose of destruction.So, what is the point of this film? There isn't one, as far as I can tell. There's no moral here, only psychosis and brutality artfully rendered. It's an appeal to cynicism, to shock value for its own sake. I suppose we are expected to react by noting that the ending was `cool' or at the very least, `original'. Yeah, right. And the really disgusting part is that this isn't some low budget slasher flick, but a top quality production with big name stars. A lot of thought, effort and talent went into making this film, but the end result is something that deserves to be flushed down a toilet.",2,9,19,28 September 2001
Fight Club," over rated
","I was pleased to see that Roger Ebert only rated this movie two stars. It's not bad, and certainly entertaining, but does it deserve to be ranked as high on the IMDb rankings as it is? In my opinion, not a chance, although I was starting to wonder if I was the only one who felt this way.
This film is, among other things, a satire that pokes fun at stuff like support groups, mindless consumerism and overall social conformity (although my view is `American Psycho' did a much better job with the latter two issues). It stars Edward Norton as `Jack'; a corporate drone who, to borrow an overused clichÃ©, basically has no life. Giving credit where due, he is perfect for the role, with a face and personality that, if he were involved in a crime or accident, eyewitnesses would invariably describe as `average'. But all this changes when he meets a rather unusual fellow flying home from a business trip. Tyler Durden, soap salesman (among other occupations) is everything Jack isn't - unconventional, brash, impulsive and seemingly fearless. The two hook up, with Jack feeding off Tyler's manic energy, and their very first night together Tyler suggests they start a fistfight just for the hell of it. Afterward, they both revel in the exhilaration of the experience (neither man had ever been in a fight before) and in due time they form `Fight Club', hence the title of the movie. What is `Fight Club'? It's an underground organization where young men fight each other as a form of therapy, or to just give them something exciting to relieve their otherwise dull and pointless lives. Jack's personality changes to more closely resemble Tyler's, he becomes more confident, in fact, downright aggressively so, as shown in a scene where he blackmails his boss about halfway through the film. Eventually the two's ambitions outgrow Fight Club, and they plan something much bigger, namely Project Mayhem, a plot to bring down major companies nationwide, all of which culminates in a somewhat bizarre plot twist at the end, one which will go unmentioned since it shows the actual nature of Jack and Tyler's `partnership' and is thus a major spoiler. Is this movie worth watching? It definitely is energetic and imaginative, but it's also chock full of pretentious pop philosophy, with dialog like `The things you own end up owning you' and `It's only after we have lost everything that we are free to do anything'. It might fulfill every closet anarchist's fantasies about `bringing down the system', but in the end, it is simply about the substitution of one kind of conformity for another. The members of Fight Club and, later, Project Mayhem, are, in reality, far more robotic than the `corporate clones' this movie purportedly makes fun of. Tyler is just another example of an infantile jerk being made into some sort of existential hero simply because he's a non-conformist, not because he actually has anything worthwhile to say. Once you get past the bravado, you find there's really nothing there. Thanks to Tyler, Jack may have found a passion and a purpose in life, but not for doing anything that actually makes the world a better place. In short, this film lacks the courage to rise above the morass of cynicism and nihilism that unfortunately has too strong a grip on modern American culture. As noted, this movie is not without its good points, the acting is uniformly solid, it throws some intriguing ideas at us, but its `message' ultimately falls flat.

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The perfect drunken frat party movie
","This is the perfect frat party movie. Just get a bunch of drunken guys around the VCR, and pop in a tape of 'South Park, the Movie'. There's no point to this film, it's just a bunch of kids learning the joys of swearing. In fact, the plot, to the extent it exists at all, just gets in the way of the raunchy comedy. In short, the drunker you are, the more you will enjoy this film. I must admit, I wasn't all that fond of the TV series. It seemed like just another comedy based on annoying, bratty kids, a theme that's been done do death with 'The Simpsons' and 'Beavis & Butthead'. But this movie is perfect for the frat set. All the TV restrictions on language are removed, so the boys are free to swear their asses off. It's not 'Animal House', but for now, it will do.  6/10",6,0,1,13 December 2001
The Day After Tomorrow," Awful!
","OK, the visuals were great, but then again, with CGI technology what it is today, that's no longer much of a bragging point. The rest was purely awful. This movie is nothing if not an endless series of clichés ripped off from just about every disaster movie ever made, from 'The Poseidon Adventure' to 'Earthquake' and 'Twister'. The only thing missing were the dinosaurs from the Jurassic Park films, but I guess they would have frozen to death in the new 'Ice Age'. At least with 'Independence Day' the Producer/Director Roland Emmerich never tried to insult the audience's intelligence by presenting that film as anything other than big budget summertime brain candy.3/10",3,0,1,13 October 2004
Catch-22," A nice try, but can't CATCH the essence of the book
","This tale would have been perfect for adaptation as an HBO mini-series, i.e., a format where they could have really fleshed out the characters and, more importantly, all the little details that made the book an instant classic. Giving credit where due, this is probably as best as could be managed given the time constraints of filming a conventional movie. But so much was missed, and in this book especially, it's all the little details that really make it work. For one, there's a slew of minor characters like Big Chief White Halfoat and Lt. Scheitzkopf <sp?> that really make it shine. That, and all the hilarious side plot developments, such as the trial of Clevinger (court martialed for, among other charges, being a dope and 'listening to classical music') and the way the commanding general changes from the pugnacious, bombastic Dreedle ('take that man outside and shoot him!') to the punctilious General Peckem, who doesn't care if his bombers actually hit the enemy so long as they make a 'good bomb pattern', to the final absurdity of General Scheitzkopf, whose rapid promotion is due to his sole military talent, marching his men around in parades. All these characters and the wealth of details that make their story come to life (the chaplain and his insecurities, Col. Cathcart, whose talent for bullying his men is exceeded only by his desire to kiss up to his superiors, and so forth) really deserve a full telling, the sort that would require a minimum of 8 to 12 hours of screen time, and no filmmaker, regardless of how talented, could have packed it into the space of just a couple hours.7/10",Null,2,4,4 June 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Classic Cold War Comedy
","While this movie isn't quite in the same league for all-out hilarity as such comedy icons as 'Airplane!' or 'Clerks', it nonetheless is a classic in its own right. Quite simply, this film asks the question - what could possibly be funny about nuclear war? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. We have an Air Force general who flips out and, on his own authority, sends his bombers to attack the USSR. At his side is an RAF officer who doesn't seem to know quite how to deal with the whole situation. On a larger scale, the president and his men are assembled in the War Room as they attempt to placate the Soviet Premier (who just happens to be drunk) in an effort to avoid Armageddon. Not that it matters, as it turns out, one lone American bomber gets through, thus triggering the Doomsday Device, and ending all life on Earth. Well, not entirely, for it seems that a mysterious Dr. Strangelove has concocted a plan in which all virile males can hide out in the nation's deepest mineshafts and reproduce (at a ratio of ten women to each man) so as to assure the continuation of the human race despite all the radiation on the planet's surface.On the surface, this sounds like a recipe for a mess, yet director Stanley Kubrick makes it work. To be honest, this is really Peter Sellars' movie; it is he who deserves the lion's share of the credit for this film's enduring success. For example, when I first saw this movie some 15 years ago, I had no idea that Sellars played the three leads in this film, I had him pegged only as the veddy proper British officer Lionel Mandrake, not having the slightest clue that he also played the geekish American president as well as the nutcase German scientist Dr. Strangelove. It is to Sellars' credit that he managed to play such different characters while making each utterly convincing. In addition, much credit is due to George Scott as the bombastic General Turgison. The scenes where he stares down the president while stuffing gum in his face are definitely priceless. And, last but not least, is the Soviet ambassador DeSadeski, who alternates from being menacing to being ludicrous. There are rumors that Slim Pickens (the B-52 pilot) was never told this was a satire, and was requested to play the role straight. This I find hard to buy; anyone who recalls the part where he reads off the contents of the survival kits, which include such items as lipstick, condoms, and nylon stockings, will find it hard to believe he could do that scene with a straight face without being in on the joke. Also, there are a number of acts of sheer farce, such as when Mandrake is forced to order Col. `Bat' Guano to shoot open a Coke machine in order to get change to phone the president to put an end to the nuclear crisis. There are some 'Airplane!' style sight gags, most notably when the B-52 is flying low over Russia but its shadow is that of a World War 2 B-17. And the pacing is also dead on. At first, there is little evidence this is actually a satire, one could easily watch the first half hour or so and fully believe they were seeing a serious (albeit, rather corny and low budget) war film. But, in time, the humor builds, such that, by the end, the president and his men are contemplating the advantages of being holed up in a mineshaft with hordes of women chosen primarily for their sexually stimulating attributes when all the while Strangelove is trying (and failing) to suppress his rabid love for his `Fuehrer'.In the final analysis, this movie has a lot going for it, but it also has its flaws. Most notably, it is politically dated. Apparently the impetus behind Gen. Ripper's plan to attack the USSR is that he thinks the `Rooskies' have plotted to contaminate our water supply with fluoride. I guess, back when this movie was released, people could relate since the notion of flouridization as a `Commie plot' was popular among conspiracy theory nuts at the time, but to a modern audience, the reference just seems out of date. Also, it seems to suggest that opponents of communism were nothing more than paranoid knuckle dragging Neanderthals, a notion that has hardly withstood the test of time. Finally, there are the silly names and sexual innuendo. I guess having names like General Jack Ripper and Premier Kissoff has a certain entertainment value, but at the same time they seem childish, like something I'd have called my teachers behind their back in 5th grade. Quite honestly, Beavis and Butt-head came up with funnier names when they tried to join the army as Major Woody and Private Parts. And having Ripper ramble on about the loss of his precious bodily fluids was no doubt sexually risqué in the 1960's, but by today's standards it just seems, well, icky. But these are nitpicks. On the whole, this movie has stood the test of time and remains a classic from its era.9/10",9,1,1,29 May 2002
Scary Movie 2," Not as good as the 1st one, but OK
","Perverted pedophile priests performing an exorcism, possessed pussycats, haunted houses, killer klowns, this movie takes every horror film convention and turns it on its head. In addition it manages to poke fun at stuff like girls wanting to be `friends' with a boy, then finding out what it's like when he treats her like a football buddy or frat brother. And of course this wouldn't be a Wayan bros. movie if it weren't chock full of political incorrectness; it's loaded with cripple/deformity jokes, gay jokes, drug jokes, racial jokes, (including a statue of Thomas Jefferson, complete with his black mistress and a half dozen black rugrats), even a joke involving a former president and a stained dress! Perhaps my favorite joke was when one of the girls was running away from a skeleton, and the other girl says, `What are you scared of? This is bones! Would you run away from Calista Flockheart?' To be sure, this movie isn't as good as the first one (the one whose tagline promised, among other things, `No Sequel') but for pure gross-out, turn your brain off fun, it's not bad.6/10",6,0,1,3 September 2002
Lost in Translation," Most boring movie EVER!
","What's there to say? This is a movie in which nothing happens. And it happens to a bunch of utterly uninteresting nobodies. Bill Murray is supposedly engaged in 'understated' acting. Mostly he looks like a man either bored to death, or in one weeklong Valium trance. His counterpart, Scarlet Johansson, is lost in some sort of existential fog. Maybe these are the kind of people who relate to this movie, and thus find some sort of deep, meaningful message in it. I don't. The whole premise is these two are in Japan for a week, he to shoot ads for a local liquor company, she to basically do nothing while her husband, a famous photographer, also shoots ads. They're both stuck in the same plush hotel, so they hook up. Sort of. Mostly, to the extent they do anything at all, they commiserate. She's unhappy with her marriage. He can't even muster up that much energy. He drinks a lot (making him, at least, a good pitchman for his product). Together they, um, well, do stuff. I guess. About the only thing memorable was where they hung out with some Japanese party animals, one of whom does a (bad) Karaoke rendition of a Sex Pistols song. Oh, the hell with it, merely trying to describe what this movie is about is such a dull process it's putting ME to sleep. Better simply to describe what's wrong with it, which is to say, just about everything.First off, Bill Murray doesn't even remotely resemble what he's supposed to be, a washed up action movie star reduced to doing commercials in Japan. Instead, he comes across as some middle class nobody, a salesman perhaps, forced to spend a week abroad on business. Which brings up another complaint. This film comes off as if these two actually live in Japan, and are finding it difficult to adjust. Which would have made far more sense, but a week? Anyone can put up with being in a foreign country for a week! But most important, there's absolutely no dramatic tension at all. The closest they come to doing anything scandalous is when they share a couple tepid kisses at the very end. And she, wandering around in her philosophical haze, could have come up with something more dramatic than visiting a Buddhist temple a couple times. How about a suicide attempt? A big fight with her husband when he's sucking up to the hot, blonde starlet (who I mistook for Cameron Diaz, turns out she's played by Anna Faris, of 'Scary Movie' fame)? Something, anything!Oh well. This movie plays like 'American Beauty', if you took that film and sucked it dry of everything funny, weird or erotic. That film, while somewhat pretentious, was at least interesting. In contrast, one gets the sense that this film wants to be pretentious too, but it simply lacks the energy.1/10",1,58,111,17 March 2004
Interstellar," Oh Gawd, this was awful!
","This movie made me wish I was both deaf and blind. Blind, so I wouldn't have to see it, and deaf so that I wouldn't have to hear the soundtrack, which was like having nails pounded into your skull with a hammer. I will now have to plug my headphones into my iPhone and play a few Motley Crue songs just to get the sludge out of my brain. This gets 2 out of 10 only because some of the acting (and overacting) was good, so the actors get some credit here. Lots of boo-hooey scenes of astronauts crying over this and that, the soundtrack being relentlessly over-dramatic and so was everything else. This is the sort of film where you could take all the characters and blow them up with an atom bomb, and you would find yourself cheering at the end. Honestly, two hours of Beavis and Butt-Head reruns would be a vast improvement over this movie.",2,2,4,10 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Technically brilliant, otherwise OK
","As a Star Wars fan, I've often wondered why the latest two Star Wars films have taken quite a beating, and I think part of the reason is this: thanks to the fact that we saw Episodes IV thru VI first, we already know how the story ends, and so much of the suspense is lost, leaving fans with much more energy to expend on their complaints. I mean, let's be honest, the acting and dialog in the Star Wars series has always been more a matter of competence than brilliance, it was the wonderful imagination and groundbreaking visual effects that made them great.That said, my feelings about the new films are thus: The Phantom Menace is definitely underrated, sure Jar Jar is annoying and Lucas was a fool to throw in those references to the Midicloridians sp? and Annakin's `virgin' birth, but these can be easily overlooked (as Lucas himself seems to have done, since nowhere in this film are they mentioned). Phantom Menace has the same epic quality that made the other three great - sweeping vistas, beautiful scenery, and a plot that takes its time developing; after all, there's a lot of background to establish. And when I saw this in the theater, I was most pleased, figuring it would finally shut up all the critics who hated TPM. But, truth be told, after buying it on DVD, my enthusiasm has waned. Giving credit where due, the effects are still outstanding and so are the action scenes, but the `epic' quality is lacking. Lucas seems much too eager to show off his technical skills, and too much effort was put into developing great action sequences at the expense of basic plot and character development. For example, it is crucial for the plot for Annakin and Padme to fall in love, but in this movie they just don't have any chemistry. Put aside the problem of the fact that he ages over a decade while she barely ages at all, I can willingly suspend some belief here, but their basic characters just don't gell. She is dignified and wise beyond her years, and would surely see that Annakin, despite his talents and good intentions, is seriously unbalanced. To be fair, I don't think it's either actor's fault, in fact, the `clunky' dialog between them struck me as refreshingly realistic, the way real first time lovers speak, awkward and tongue-tied as opposed to the usual slick Hollywood product of highly paid professional writers, but no amount of acting or writing can save a romance that seems as forced and unrealistic as this one does.As for the rest, the pairing of Annakin and Obi Wan is quite good; the former clearly respects his mentor but also resents his often-domineering manner and it's fairly obvious that there will be a violent falling out between these two in Episode III. There are a number of memorable scenes, including the one on the water planet where we first meet Boba Fett and his father, a beautifully filmed space dogfight in an asteroid belt, and of course the climactic final battle scene. No question but that Lucas has not lost his touch for SFX laden action scenes, although I personally found the fight between Yoda and Count Dooku to have been a bit silly, like watching an attack hamster on speed. The problem is Lucas seems to have lost sight of the larger story. While Annakin and Padme are frolicking on Naboo and Obi Wan is chasing after a mysterious assassin, in the background the Republic is faced with division as thousands of star systems threaten to secede. Why? Who knows, Lucas is far too busy on scenes like the one in which Annakin and Padme have to fight off a bunch of bug people to explore this seemingly vital matter more fully. And the Clone Army, we are shown in much detail how they are made, but not why, which is surely the more important issue. In short, the problem with this movie is the story simply takes a back seat to the action, and what we get is a highly competent piece of entertainment, but an effort that doesn't quite measure up to the standard of being a truly epic film like the others in the series.",10,95,190,5 February 2003
Top Secret!," Good, but no 'Airplane!'
","This movie definitely has its moments, but it simply doesn't match up to the ZAZ team's masterpiece. I think the main difference is that in 'Airplane!' the humor is effortless, the gags just flow naturally, wheras in 'Top Secret!' it's as if they were trying too hard, straining to be funny, and it shows. Or perhaps it's just that maybe spy movies aren't as easy to parody as disaster films. Whatever it is, this movie just wasn't nearly as funny.",Null,0,3,20 October 2002

I mean, talk about a cringe moment! I have already endured the 'accidental drinking of the beer with the used condom in it' scene followed by the barfing over the girl scene, but I have hit my limit. This movie is going back into its case and back to the video store with the rest unwatched. I mean, it's not like I'm some kind of prude when it comes to my viewing habits. I loved 'Married ... With Children' and most of Kevin Smith's films, but this falls into the category of being crude and disgusting without being creative or funny. 2/10",2,10,21,25 February 2002

","I am not normally much of a fan of the `Sword & Sorcery' genre, but this movie just blew me away. The visuals, the acting, the storytelling, all are simply superb. There's plenty of CGI and special effects, but unlike certain other movies (Terminator 2, for example) they do not dominate the film, but merely enhance the basic plot.  This is without doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly the best of the past year. If this doesn't dominate the Oscars, then Hollywood is in a state of serious denial. Films like this is what movies are supposed to be all about. 10+ out of 10",10,1,1,20 March 2002

And of course her best friend is a blonde airhead nympho, the film version of 'Married ... with Children's' Kelly Bundy. A blonde bimbo, say it ain't so! And Marine Corps Daddy next door is a rabid homophobe because (Get This!!!) he's secretly in the closet!! Gosh, that's not a cliche or anything, is it???OK, so there's plenty about this film to poke fun at, especially the times when it takes itself waaay too seriously. Nonetheless, it is well put together. The acting is first rate, and there are numerous moments that are comic genius, most notably, the setup that causes Major Dad to think his son and Kevin Spacey are having sex together when in fact they're smoking pot and the scene where Wifey and the Real Estate stud get busted in the drive through lane at the fast food joint where Spacey is manning the register.
So, the bottom line is - ignore the pretentious bits where this movie tries to send a 'message' and just enjoy the parts that are funny as hell.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Great movie, except for the annoying brat kid
","I seem to be in the minority here (based on the IMDb top 250 movie ratings) in that, spectacular as T2 is, I still prefer the original. Now, I must say that, having just watched it on DVD after having not seen it since it was playing in theaters, it's a better movie than I initially thought. Back then, I remembered it being a case of stunning special effects and amazing stunts trumping the basic story and characters (much like Independence Day), this in contrast to T-1 where they merely complemented them. I still think that is somewhat true, however, after watching this movie again, I really do have to give credit to most of the actors, as well as the writer(s), for a job well done. First off, Arnold simply delivers. Just as no one else could have played the terminator in the first movie, he's the only one who could play it in this one. He's still a machine, but much like Star Trek's Mr. Spock, there's a hint of humanity and humor right below the surface, and to portray this skillfully requires a degree of subtlety that Schwarzenegger hadn't previously been noted for. Robert Patrick is perfect as the emotionless, yet relentless machine sent to kill john Connor. Linda Hamilton returns, only now she has to escape from a mental institute to save her son, Earl Boen also returns as the perfect combination of jerk and dork as Sarah's shrink, and on and on. Perhaps the best scenes, at least in terms of emotional intensity, are the ones in the psych ward, where Sarah goes from determined escapee to terrified woman fleeing at her first encounter with the (good) terminator at the elevator to protective mom when the three of them steal a cop car and make their escape. The only thing I would have added would have been to show what happened to Dr. Silberman after he witnessed the encounter between Sarah, her son, and the two terminators. After all, he was the one who'd been scoffing at Sarah from the beginning, so it would have been amusing to see how he dealt with finding out that, far from being a loony, Sarah had simply been telling the truth. Would they have had to lock him up, or would he have simply gone into denial to protect his sanity and his reputation? Anyway, the bottom line is this film grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go till the credits roll. The amount of action is simply stunning, just think of what it took to film the final 30 minutes or so, from the gunplay at the Cyberdyne headquarters to the helicopter chase, and ending up in the steel factory. The story is well paced and, for the most part, the acting first rate. The only exception I'll make is for the kid. There are many instances where his dialog is simply awful, and his basic character seems unsuitable for someone who's supposed to be a great leader in the future. As just one example, there's a scene early on, shortly after John and the terminator have escaped from the mall, where he yells to a couple of guys to `help get this psycho off me!' then, when they actually come over to do just that, he insults them and has the terminator nearly beat them to death. This was just the worst scene he's featured in, but there are plenty of others, such as, right after the aforementioned scene, he tries to explain to the terminator why he can't kill people, but he seems unable to come up with a better rationale than `because you just can't. Trust me on this'. I'll be blunt Â– this kid (at least for me) is fully as annoying as Jar Jar Binks was in `Phantom Menace', and of course, since he's one of the main characters, it definitely detracts from an otherwise great movie. So, for that I rate it 9 out of ten.",9,1,1,17 September 2002
The Fast and the Furious," I'll take movie ripoffs for $400, Alex
","I'll take movie ripoffs for $400, AlexThis movie, released in 2001, blatantly stole the plot of 'Point Break' starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves.What is 'The Fast and the Furious?'Correct!What more is there to say?

Quantum of Solace," Worst Bond movie EVER!
","I saw this in the theatre a few years ago when it came out, and the funny thing was, I couldn't remember a thing about it. So, when it was on cable TV a couple nights ago, I decided to watch it again to see if it was any good. It wasn't. Indeed, I found out why I couldn't remember anything about it the first time, because there was nothing worth remembering about it the second time, either. It's a given that most James Bond movies have plots that range from over-the-top to the downright preposterous, but nonetheless the plots are at least understandable. But 'Quantum of Solace' has no plot at all, at least none that I could discern. It's just a bunch of action and fight scenes and car chases strung together with no central story to make you care about any of them. But beyond that, what was lacking in this movie was any sense of fun or style, two things that could usually redeem even the worst of previous Bond efforts. Bond is grim throughout, and one gets the sense that neither he nor 'M' (Judi Dench) particularly like or trust each other.The whole point of the Bond series was that it was pure, escapist fantasy. It presented a world in which you got to drive fast cars, travel to exotic locales, and have sex with gorgeous women. The whole thing was about glamour and style, and reality be damned! But apparently the current trend is to have Bond movies strive more for gritty realism. Well, I guess they got the 'Grit' part right, but in the process tossed out all the fun and charm. In short, this movie fails as even good entertainment. Indeed, you would be much better served watching the silly Vin Diesel effort 'xXx', with Diesel playing the wise-cracking, tattooed anti-Bond and Samuel L Jackson having ten times as much fun as Judi Dench in the role of his 'Boot to ass' boss.",2,7,10,3 February 2014
Independence Day," Just sit back and enjoy!
","This movie isn't about Oscar award winning acting, directing or writing and it doesn't explore deep, serious issues, nor does it try to be any of these things. It is simply great entertainment in the tradition of the big budget Hollywood Sci-Fi special effects extravaganzas. The plot is simple enough, and hardly original. Aliens arrive at our planet and intend to wipe up out. We fight back, and in the end human ingenuity and courage win the day.
What makes this movie work, quite simply, are the combination of the straight forward way the story is told, the basic competence of the actors (Jeff Goldblum, as always, plays the quirky science geek type character to perfection) and of course the awesome effects. If you see the DVD version of this movie, you can watch the companion disc which explains how they made everything from the aliens to the spectacular White House explosion scene. Clearly the people who made this movie wanted to spare no expense in creating absolutely stunning visuals, and they succeeded on every level.Quite simply, the way to see a movie like this is to just sit back and enjoy 2 hours of great entertainment. Don't expect anything more, since that's simply not the point. This movie isn't about impressing the critics, but simply giving the viewers a fun time. And at that, it succeeds brilliantly. 8/10",8,0,3,8 July 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Lame plot, lamer characters
","Note: some minor spoilersIt's pretty bad when you rent this movie and 'Charlie's Angels' (both on DVD) at the same time, and the movie based on a 70's TV show is FAR better than the one directed by Steven Spielberg. Both were little more than mindless entertainment, but at least that was the point of 'Angels' and it succeeded brilliantly. All TLW proved was they could build on the special effects successes of the original and add a lame plot and lamer characters. I mean, this is little more than 'King Kong' brought to the 90's with up to date effects. Greedy corporate types go to remote island to bring back monster to put on display. Monster wreaks havoc, both on the island and in the USA. Lots of people die (mainly because of stupid decision by all concerned), the monster is eventually brought under control, roll the credits, the end. The only two characters even remotely interesting are Jeff Goldblum's Ian and the big game hunter Roland. Ian correctly forecasts doom and disaster, but what difference does it make since no one listens to him? And Roland is the only character with any dimension. On the one hand, his primary motivation is to bag a T-Rex as the ultimate trophy, on the other, he's about the only one with an ounce of common sense (besides Ian, that is). You've got Julianne Moore as the naive scientist who seems to think dinosaurs are little more than cuddly teddy bears, and the insanely idiotic Nick Van Owen, whose practically every move served to put people's lives at risk. Let's see, you've got an injured baby T-Rex, let's bring it inside the trailer to heal it while the parents are searching for it. And let's release all the caged dinos, thus turning the well organized camp into a chaotic mess. Finally, when he shows the bullets he removed from Roland's gun, I'm amazed Ian and the rest didn't just heave him off the helicopter for ruining the one chance of survival for pretty much everyone on the island. And if that's not bad enough, who on Earth thinks the authorities are going to just let a full grown Tyrannasaur roam about San Diego without doing anything about it while Ian and Dr. Stupid (AKA Sarah) do a repeat of the infant dino bit to lure Mommy back onto the cargo ship? My bet is in reality they'd have had helicopter gunships on it in a heartbeat. Bottom line: If you want great effects accompanied by a stupid plot, this is the movie to see.",4,0,2,12 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As good as the first one!
","And that's saying a LOT, seeing as how I rated that a 10+/10. And I normally have little interest in the whole 'Sword & Sorcery' genre, so my high praise means even more than usual. They were wise to film all three LOTR movies at the same time, for it means the 2nd follows the style of the first seamlessly. These are truly labors of love, every aspect of these films are crafted with exquisite care, it is obvious that all the people involved, from the producers, actors and directors on down wanted to spare no effort to pay full homage to Tolkien's classic works. There are virtually no flaws, and to point out what tiny ones exist would come off as churlish, so I simply won't bother. The acting is uniformly solid, and that's no small praise considering there are well over a DOZEN major characters here. And, just as with the first, the sheer amount of detail, the vastness of the story, is almost overwhelming, these clearly are movies that can be seen many times because there's so much to be absorbed. It's a shame this (like its predecessor) will probably be snubbed for Best Picture Oscar because it's obvious to anyone other than a complete dullard that these are landmark films whose appeal will long outlast the other Oscar contenders10+/10",Null,0,0,24 February 2003
Caddyshack," A classic!
","This movie will never get old, like 'Airplane!', it's a comedy classic. The best part about it is it took some of America's top comic actors when they were at the prime of their careers and built a comedy that's more than just the sum of its parts. I mean, just having Bill Murray or Rodney Dangerfield in a movie, even a mediocre one, guarantees you will laugh, but this film features these two, along with Chevy Chase and Ted Knight, in what is arguably each man's funniest effort. As with most comedies, the plot is pretty much incidental to the film itself. In this case, it's centered on a young caddy who can't afford to go to college, so he is forced to suck up to the head of the country club (Ted Knight) in an effort to get his blessing for a caddy scholarship. His golf mentor is a rich heir (Chevy Chase, back when he was still funny) who's into 'Zen golf' and gives Danny advice like 'Be the ball' and 'A donut with no hole is a Danish'. To complicate matters, a real estate developer (Rodney Dangerfield) shows up with his entourage, looking, not to join the club but instead to buy it. This is the setup for the rest of the film. From the start, the expansive, profane, boorish Dangerfield character clashes with the anal, rigid, and tantrum-prone club president, Judge Smails. And, in the background, Bill Murray is the groundskeeper who's been ordered to kill all the gophers on the course. Of course, this order comes from his Scottish boss, a man with an accent as thick as Guinness Stout, and Murray's character Carl, replies 'But if I kill all the golfers, they'll lock me up and throw away the key!'Anyway, that's the basic premise. What makes this movie work are the lead actors, as well as first rate scriptwriting. You normally wouldn't think of a golf course as being the scene for great comedy, but with this bunch, anything goes. There's tons of great dialog; Judge Smails 'Danny, I've sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber. Didn't want to, but I felt I owed it to them', Dangerfield to a woman at the club 'Last time I saw a mouth like that it had a hook in it!', Carl to gopher 'Don't mind me, I'm just a harmless squirrel, not a plastic explosive or something', and on and on. There's great physical comedy, especially when Rodney goes berzerk with his massive yacht, crashing into anything and everything in sight, and Ted Knight, whose eyes seem to bulge of of their sockets at least once a minute. In short, it's a comic classic that was hilarious 20 years ago, and is still funny every time I watch it now. A must see!  10 out of 10",10,2,4,14 January 2002
Black Hawk Down," Raw
","This film is just about the closest Hollywood has ever done to creating a war documentary, which can make it a bit difficult to rate as one might a 'regular' war movie. Unlike films like 'Saving Pvt. Ryan' which created a fictional tale set in a larger, factual context, this movie shows us the actual men and actions over a hellish 15 hours in Somalia, the well known debacle in which 19 men were killed after a raid designed to capture some of Somalia's worst warlords went awry.First off, I want to address a few criticisms leveled here, most of them coming from left wingers and assorted Euro-trash who seem to have a knee-jerk negative reaction to pretty much anything the American military does. One, though made in co-operation with the Pentagon (like, Duh!, where else are they gonna get all those expensive helicopters?) it is hardly a propaganda piece, if anything, the incident was a major embarrassment to our military, so much so that then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin was fired because of it. The men were sent in unprepared (bad Intel) and without the proper equipment (which was more of a political decision). The men themselves comported themselves bravely (this being no more than historical fact) yet their leaders were often indecisive, vacillating over how to react as one, then a second, chopper got shot down. I myself was practically screaming for additional helicopter gunship support for the beleaguered men, yet for some reason it was used very sparingly even as the guys on the ground were being cut to ribbons.Next is the 'race' issue. True, far more Somalis were killed than Americans, but as the film shows, the vast majority of these were the warlord's armed thugs, not helpless civilians. Unlike the Viet Cong, the Serbs or even the Nazis, these men were not fighting for any sort of cause other than simply satisfying their own greed. The warlords and their armed mobs (they are not worthy of being dignified with the title of 'soldier') got rich by plundering the relief supplies that were supposed to go to famine victims. The film accurately portrays these people as the vermin they are, and I must admit my favorite scene was when (finally!) American gunships popped in that night and hosed them down by the dozens with rockets and miniguns. Harsh as it may sound, it was morally satisfying to see these human scumbags exterminated like a bunch of roaches. And the people who can't see the difference between these parasites enriching themselves at the expense of their own people and the ordinary Somali civilians are simply not playing with a full deck.Anyway, that aside, this film succeeds pretty much on every level. People may complain that the characters are not developed enough or that the larger geo-political issues are not explored further, but the movie was simply not intended to do either. Instead, its principal aim is to give a raw, visceral look at the actual events that took place on that fateful day. As others have noted, it takes the approach used in Pvt. Ryan and extends it over almost the entire film. If you want to experience modern close urban combat on a gut level, this delivers the goods in spades. At times I found it confusing, trying to figure out which guys were where, but that merely reflects the reality of the actual confusion. At one point, two soldiers are simply left behind, they'd been completely forgotten when their unit was ordered to move to the first crash site. Really, the only objection I can come up with is that, on a few occasions, Ridley Scott relies excessively of SFX and `artsy' shots, which I found to detract from the otherwise compelling gritty realism.In the final analysis, I cannot really give this film the usual 1-10 scale rating, though it would rank at least a 7 if I did. Mr. Scott and his team of actors, cameramen, and effects guys do a fine job, but it's the story itself that makes this movie what it is. And, for that, we have a bunch of brave American soldiers to ultimately thank.",Null,0,0,21 March 2002
The Dark Knight," Weird, sadistic, no redeeming value, really
","The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch 'The Godfather'. Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from 'Goodfellas' or Luca Brasi from 'The Godfather'. But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.3/10",3,10,19,21 February 2013
Reservoir Dogs," Good, but no Pulp Fiction
","Note *** Contains spoilers ***It's easy to see how Tarantino's unique style evolved, which later allowed him to produce his masterpiece a couple years later. The same elements are in this film as well: intense violence, snappy dialogue, abrupt changes in time (forward and backward) as well as a memorable ensemble of characters. And he uses an ingenious plot device, namely, an experienced crime boss and his son have hired six thieves to pull off a robbery of a diamond wholesaler. The catch is Â– none of the men know each other, and are assigned names such as `Mr. White' `Mr. Blonde' and so forth.  This way, if one gets caught, he can't rat out any of the others. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. One of the `crooks' is actually an undercover cop, as a result, the robbery blows up into a huge shootout, with the men scattering madly to escape a police ambush. The bulk of the film deals with what happens as the men try to reassemble at the agreed meeting point; in fact, we see very little of the robbery itself, the details are revealed later by the various characters. What Tarantino achieves here is not only an interesting crime drama, but also, due to both the pacing of the direction and the actors' skills, he presents a gut wrenching mood of fear, mistrust, and paranoia which ends up in a classic three way confrontation not unlike the one in `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'. The movie really does grab the viewer right from the start and doesn't let go until the very end. And Tarantino is to be credited for assembling a first rate cast of classic movie `dirtbags' (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, etc.).So why then don't I rate this higher? Part of the problem is that, at least when compared to `Pulp Fiction', this movie is too cynical and nihilistic. `Pulp Fiction' was fun; this film isn't. It leaves you feeling somewhat dirty and slimy, as if you'd spent a couple of hours in a sewer or rummaging through a garbage dump. There's one graphic scene in which one of the robbers, a certified psychopath, engages in extreme acts of cruelty in torturing a cop he'd kidnapped. This was, IMHO, gratuitous and simply didn't need to be there. Also, I didn't like the ending at all. At this point, everyone is dead except for `Mr. White (Keitel) and `Mr. Orange' (Roth) and the police are about to move in. `Orange' admits to `White' that he was the mole. This I have a really hard time buying. After all, he has managed to stay in character despite being shot in the guts, he's witnessed several acts of extreme brutality, and at the very end he wimps out? No way.
So, in the final analysis, this is a decent movie that gives us a taste of what Tarantino has in store for us with `Pulp Fiction', but it's definitely not in the same league as that work of genius.7/10",7,0,1,27 May 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," 'American Pie' was better
","There is supposed to be some deep, maybe even profound, message to this movie, but, for me at any rate, I sure couldn't find it. Indeed, my recollection of this film, which I've only seen once, on Pay-Per-View shortly after it came out, was that this was basically really high class porno made by an extremely skilled director. As such, the best (and maybe only) way to enjoy this movie is to fast forward through all the parts that don't contain naked ladies. The problem is, 'Kubrick' and 'Emotional richness and complexity' are two expressions that just don't go together. Think about how many of his characters, from Strangelove to this present movie, that you really cared about. The only one that comes to my mind is the unfortunate fat kid who cracks under pressure in the boot camp part of 'Full Metal Jacket'. And that's the problem with this film. We just don't care about these characters AT ALL. At best, this is a stylistic exercise, a slick production that is utterly devoid of real human heart. In that sense, 'American Pie', which came out the same year, does a much better job of exploring the sometimes embarrassing and often hilarious things that occur when men and women (or, in this case, boys and girls) tap dance around the issues of love, romance, and sex. Unlike 'Eyes Wide Shut', we see real human beings in real human situations with real human emotions. We can relate to them, and laugh along with them as they deal with the various foibles that come with human relationships. In contrast, the characters from this movie might as well be cyborgs for all the warmth they bring to the screen.",3,2,9,24 February 2013
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A Tarantino ripoff
","This is, quite bluntly, a complete ripoff of Quentin Tarantino. The soundtrack, the dialog, the whole way this film is put together is simply a well made imitation of 'Pulp Fiction', even to the point of having a 'badass black dude with an afro' in it. The story's not bad, although to my eyes at any rate, there's simply too many characters. It gets to where it's impossible to keep track of them all. In contrast, 'Pulp Fiction' had just the right amount of characters and plot complexity to engage your brain without making you feel like you had to keep rewinding the movie to figure out who was who and where each character fit into the plot. This movie, judged by it's own merits, would be fairly good, but when compared to PF, it's barely adequate. 5/10PS Brit criminals may come off as scary and intimidating to, well, Brits, but my guess is most American criminals would take one look at Mr. 'Hatchet' Harry, then laugh in his face before hosing him down with an AK-47. Brits just aren't very good at portraying really convincing tough guys.",5,2,6,6 September 2002
Titanic," Not great, but good
","I just finished watching this on TV. It's easy to see why this movie was initially overhyped and overrated, then trashed as nothing more than a pre-teen chick flick. In truth, it's a lot like 'Dances with Wolves', a big screen three hour plus epic that grabbed a fistful of Oscars, then p***ed everyone off by beating out what many thought was a superior film (for 'Titanic' it was 'LA Confidential', for 'Wolves' it was 'Goodfellas'). I don't know if it was Oscar material, but it was definitely better than the critics now claim. On the plus side, no expense was spared in getting every detail visually perfect. I don't know how he did it, but James Cameron managed to thoroughly convince his audience that it was the real Titanic we were seeing. And the sinking scenes were amazingly real, enough to grab the heart of the most jaded movie goer. On the minus side, far too much time was spent on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose. The story of the Titanic itself contains so much drama that wasting two hours on this love affair was simply not needed. In short, this could have been THE film of the 1990's, instead it ended up as a good, but not great, money-making blockbuster.",7,2,3,17 December 2001
The Godfather: Part III," A more personal 'Godfather' movie
","As with 'Star Wars - The Phantom Menace', this film took a lot of hits for not being a worthy successor to the original series, but in both cases I disagree. I'm certainly not going to argue that G-III is the best, but it is nonetheless a worthwhile film in its own right. For starters, it is different from the first two, and not just because of the time difference. Just as the real life actors had aged nearly two decades since G-II, so does the setting of the film, which takes place in 1979. I think one aspect that hardcore fans really missed was the lack of a stellar supporting cast, it's interesting to note in both earlier films the large number of nominations for Best Supporting Actor & Actress Awards, whereas in this film the only nomination was Andy Garcia (who, incidentally, did not win). For the most part, this is Al Pacino's movie, and it is also the first time we really get to see him (or the rest of the Family, for that matter) as real human beings. In the first two films, the Family is almost like a machine  ruthless, ambitious, and able to crush anyone who gets in the way. Vito Corleone and his sons and lieutenants operate in a world of cold rationality, when the Godfather wants to put the squeeze on someone he `reasons' with them and if that fails to persuade he makes `an offer they can't refuse'. In the first film Mike decides to kill the Turk and the crooked cop because it's the logical, rational solution to the problem of protecting his father from a rival. Later, Mike has his brother-in-law, and later still, his actual brother, killed, all in the name of protecting the Family.This film is quite different. The point where this hit me was about halfway through when Mike, back in Sicily, is making his confession to a priest. Initially, I thought, it's just a scam, he's only doing it to set someone up or get valuable information. That's what we'd expect of a Corleone, the sort of ruthless cynicism that allows you to manipulate anything, even a solemn religious ritual, for nefarious ends. But it's not that at all, Michael is genuinely remorseful for much of what he's done, most notably Fredo's murder. In another scene, he addresses the corpse of Don Tommasino (the guy who protected him when he was a fugitive in Sicily years earlier) and asks, `Why were you so loved, when I was so feared?' He's also trying to heal rifts with both his kids and his ex-wife. The whole tone of the movie is much more up to date. The women are much more prominent. Kay, his ex, still has feelings for Mike, but she's also managed to run her own life with the kids separate from him. This would have been unthinkable to a Mafia wife a generation earlier. And Connie, who in the original was little more than a whiny human punching bag for her husband, is now as cold and dangerous as her brother. In short, their lives are a far cry from that of Mama Corleone, whose job it was to shut up, take care of the kids, and keep food on the table for the boys. It must be noted, however, that none of the feminism or `touchy-feely' stuff gets in the way of some good old fashioned Corleone style violence, most notably at the end, when, in a move that is reminiscent of the end of G-1, Mike arranges to wrap up all the `loose ends' in the span of just a few hours. Anyway, the plot is somewhat convoluted. There's a big business deal going between the Corleone family and the Vatican and of course the usual corruption and payoffs. Trying to keep track of the various characters and their machinations was difficult at times, but that's really not all that important. What this movie really is about is Michael Corleone having to finally come to terms with the life he's lead and what it's done to his family. It is less a story than a look at the personal side of both him and his family and, most importantly, what all the power, money, and `respect' has cost all of them. 8/10",8,0,1,23 March 2002
Ice Age," A good airplane movie
","I just saw this on a flight back from Hawaii, and, as a way to kill time on a crowded airplane, this fit the bill nicely. It is typical animated light entertainment, in which an unlikely group of animals team up (for a variety of different reasons) after they find a baby human. This plot gimmick is, for grown-ups anyway, rather contrived, but who cares? This is, first and foremost, a kid's movie, and it borrows heavily from the classic Disney animated films in that it features a veritable menagerie of interesting and offbeat animal characters whose interactions manage to transcend an otherwise implausible story. This is by no means a great film, nor even a great animated film, nevertheless it is entirely satisfying way to spend an hour and a half, especially when you're stuffed into the back of a DC-10 late at night out in the middle of the Pacific. 6/10",6,0,2,7 July 2002
The Cannonball Run," plenty of stars, not enough cars
","This isn't a bad movie, it's entertaining enough and has lots of funny scenes and dialog. But what it lacks is ACTION. The irony is, this movie was written by none other than Brock Yates, the guy who organized the REAL Cannonball coast to coast races back in the 70's, yet a rival (and much lower budget) film called 'Gumball Rally' somehow managed to offer up far more thrills. In that film, you had a number of really fast, exotic sports cars being driven full bore on everything from Interstate highways to LA's concrete riverbeds, whereas in 'Cannonball' what we get mostly are the film's numerous stars mugging for the camera, each trying to be funnier than the next. The problem, of course, is this leaves little time for the actual racing. So, the bottom line is this - if you're looking for a decent comedy with a bunch of 70's Hollywood stars, this film is quite good. But if you want to see a REAL race movie, one where the cars are the real stars, check out 'Gumball Rally' instead.6/10",Null,2,3,23 September 2002
Any Given Sunday," Surprisingly good!
","As far as I'm concerned, Oliver Stone has quite a mixed body of work. 'Platoon' was definitely Oscar worthy, but then there was the conspiracy theory nonsense of 'JFK' and the over the top violence of 'Natural Born Killers'. But Stone puts in a solid effort with this film, a movie that both pays homage to and takes a critical look at the world of professional football. The plot itself is fairly conventional. It's basically relating the never-ending conflict between youth and maturity. On the one side, you've got experience, tradition, and loyalty, on the other, energy, innovation, and self interest. Representing the former are Al Pacino, as the coach of the Miami Sharks and their veteran quarterback, Jack 'Cap' Rooney, played by Dennis Quaid. The `young guns' consist of Cameron Diaz, a hot yet cold-blooded blonde who has inherited the team from her father, and the equally hot backup QB, Willie Beamon, (Jamie Foxx) who takes over the starting spot after Rooney gets sidelined by an injury. And, despite some great football action footage, the most memorable scenes are those which show the essential conflicts between these two forces, most notably when Pacino and Foxx turn a lunch meeting into a no holds barred verbal brawl, and when Pacino and Diaz face off over who, and more importantly, whose values, will guide the team. In addition, there's a nicely developed side issue, a conflict between the team's doctors, one an old cynic, played by James Woods, who lies to his players about the severity of their injuries in order to keep their morale (and the team's cash flow) up, and the other a youngster who still retains his ideals and basic decency. In these scenes, Stone delivers first-rate acting and interpersonal drama at its best.
In short, what makes this movie work is that Oliver Stone, while using his film to address larger social issues, nonetheless focuses first and foremost on telling a really good story. All the key actors are allowed to portray fully three-dimensional characters. We can relate to Pacino as the `old school' coach, a man who used to settle contract issues with Diaz's father over a beer and a handshake, Quaid as the legend who must nonetheless face both his age and his injuries, Foxx as the young hotshot with an attitude and a chip on his shoulder, and finally Diaz, who, despite being quite the icy bitch, also represents the business realities of modern day sports. There's also fine work by the supporting actors, most notably Jim Brown as an assistant coach, who reminisces about the `old days' when players had to sell used cars in the off season just to make ends meet. On the one hand, we can see how modern players are finally getting their fair slice of the financial pie, yet at the same time mourn the loss of team loyalty and the purity of playing for the sake of the game instead of for the next contract negotiation.

The Matrix," This is what movies are all about
","The initial response to seeing this is much like after having seen Star Wars for the first time. You just go 'Wow!'. The best movies use the visual medium to create new worlds and bring them to life, and that's what this movie is all about. In the case of 'The Matrix', you start out with a female hacker being confronted by a squad of cops. She makes a spectacular escape, making moves that are simply superhuman, and which sets up the tone for the rest of the film. You know within the first five minutes that you are in for a wild ride. Next, we are introduced to 'Neo', a hacker by night, a working stiff in a huge software company by day. He's a regular schmuck, his boss chews him out for showing up late because he's been out partying all night with his cyberpunk friends. Things seem normal enough, but something just isn't quite right. When Neo digs deeper, and makes contact with a mysterious fellow known only as Morpheus', he finds out just how wrong things really are. The most bracing scenes in this whole movie are when Morpheus shows Neo exactly the true nature of the world he lives in. Even though you know this is a sci-fi thriller with bizarre plot twists, you are simply not prepared for what he finds out. Without revealing the actual plot, let's just say it borrows ideas put forth in The Terminator, Total Recall, Tron, Blade Runner, and even Alice in Wonderland and 1984 (think of the interrogation scene) yet creates a completely original story to which are added stunning visual effects. And yet, unlike some other films, the effects just add to the basic plot as opposed to becoming the dominant feature (a la Terminator 2). For example, the virtual reality fight scenes are in themselves amazing, but merely serve to point out that, in such an environment, a well trained warrior could use his/her mind to overcome the limits of body and physics and accomplish the impossible. Well, lest I ramble on too long, the basic point is this is one of those rare movies that just grabs you from the opening minutes and never lets go. It sucks you into a bizarre world that nonetheless seems totally real and believable. What more could you ask for in a sci-fi action thriller?",Null,0,1,5 July 2001
The Breakfast Club," One big cliché made up of lots of little clichés
","I just watched this on AMC. At first I was gonna give it 6/10, then later revised that down to 3/10 and by the end of the movie I was at rock bottom - 1/10.Why does this movie suck so badly? Not because it wasn't well made, or badly acted, but rather because the the story itself is just so awful. What we have here are a bunch of smaller clichés that add it to some very big clichés. All the principal characters are clichés, and so are all of the premises of this film. You have five high school kids who are all stock high school characters - the jock, the brain, the popular pretty girl, the long haired greaser 'Tough guy' and, finally, the misfit. They are all stuck in detention for a day, under the supervision of the 6th cliché, the (I think) assistant principal, the perfect personification of (from the teenagers' POV) mindless adult authority. He might as well wear a swastika armband, so one dimensional is his character.Now, I suppose a conceit of this movie is the five kids aren't really clichés at all, but actual, real individuals who are forced into their roles by the neverending forces of social conformity (which is in itself yet another cliché), except, of course, they aren't. The jock really IS a jock, the brain a nerd, the popular girl popular, and so forth. None of them emerge as a true three dimensional character, at best they display a bit of two dimensions before reverting back to their one dimensional selves. And the principal doesn't even get that privilege, his character is a one dimensional authoritarian goon and is never allowed to rise above that basic stereotype.Speaking of adults, virtually every last one of them comes off badly, indeed, very badly. They, as described by the kids, are little more than beasts who demand perfection from their offspring and show an almost total lack of love or even affection. This is one of the movie's biggest clichés, the notion of teenagers as being wise beyond their years while their parents are essentially abusers, if not physically then certainly emotionally. Portraying all adults as rotten is not only completely unrealistic, it also feeds into the worst sort of egotism on the part of the presumed teenage audience for a movie such as this.Okay, so the kids (and their principal) are all a bunch of clichés. That's bad enough, but this film has other flaws as well. One, the misfit character, played by Ally Sheedy, seems to have no basis in reality at all. And nothing about the movie explains why she is who she is. Further, how clichéd (spoiler alert) is it that she ends up with the jock, this, after getting a makeover courtesy of the popular girl? Wouldn't it have been less of a cliché for her to end up with the brain? Also, her character would have been a lot more believable had she been genuinely unattractive, say, 30 lbs overweight, acne, and hair that was greasy looking because she never washed it. Instead, it was like - 5 minutes with a mascara brush and a little work on the hair and, Ta Da! she's beautiful! And a completely different person, too! Still, hers was probably the most likable character of the bunch, and she probably should have ended up with the nerd. By that standard, by FAR the most detestable character was the greaser. The tough guy with a heart of gold is an old staple in American entertainment, such notables include The Fonz and Vinnie Barbarino. But this guy has more like the heart of a sewer rat. That he is rude and defiant of authority is to be expected of this type of character, but his verbal attacks on the others, especially Molly Ringwald's character, border on verbal rape, so cruel and sadistic are his attacks on her. He was the one character whom you wanted to see the principal beat into a bloody pulp, unfortunately, that didn't happen. His is the worst cliché of them all, the sort of person, because he is a self-proclaimed 'Rebel' and non-conformist, is transformed from being a complete A__hole into the conscience of sorts for this film. It is his character, perhaps more than all the others combined, who ruined this movie for me. Cruelty and sadism have their place in the movies (think 'Apocalypse Now') but they absolutely don't belong in what is supposed to be a light teenage comedy.And that's about it. When I first saw this back in the 1980's (on HBO, probably) I didn't think this movie was particularly good or back. But having now seen it just a couple hours ago, I think it truly sucks.1/10",1,32,64,2 May 2013
The Godfather," Slightly overrated
","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred 'Goodfellas'. The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10",8,130,244,4 April 2002
