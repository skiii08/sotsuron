Alien 3," One of the best movie!
","This is the most underestimated movie, unfortunately! Before the set, the idea was to complete the series of Ripley's journey to this rough life and i think David Fincher did this work well, if we will take into account that producer's was not satisfied by Fincher's vision of the story.Some one will say that Ripley is acting a tad strange in this movie, that she was a very smart woman in the other two films and what happened in this one? This question is for those who not seen previous series. She acting like she tired of all this - her daughter is dead, as we know from the Alien's, and Amanda is dead now too. The atmosphere of screenplay show's that everything Ripley does is doomed! In the end she find's the only way to finish with all this by suicide. What else you expected from this? The Happy end? Its the greatest movie i every seen. The screenplay is an extraordinary - you will not find like this one anywhere. Every time i watch it, especially the Director's Cut version, i found something new for my self. The beast can be not only in the Alien but in a human species also - the most dangered in the world!",10,5,6,18 July 2014
