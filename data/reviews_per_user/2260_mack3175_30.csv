After they get the ship fixed, Qui-Gon decides to take Anakin back, in hopes to train him has a jedi. This was truly a great movie. Amazingly great story telling by George Lucas. It was nice to see the origins of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. I don't care what critics say about this movie, I loved it. I've been a Star Wars fan for a long time, and I was truly excited when this movie came out. It had great action, great drama, and a great light saber fight scene. Truly a great beginning.",Null,1,3,13 June 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Frank Abagnale: The Real Life Pretender
","They said truth is stranger then fiction, and this movie is direct proof of that. Leonardo DiCaprio really shines in his performance has Frank Abagnale, who forged checks and posed has a Co-pilot, Lawyer, and Doctor. And he was'nt even twenty one. He seems to pull it off nicely. Until one day one of his forged checks gets spotted by uptight FBI agent Carl Hanratty(played very well by Tom Hanks). Who soon sets out to find him. And it now becomes a game of cat and mouse. This movie was also good for it's 60's look. And beautifully directed by Steven Spielberg. I hope he gets nominated for best director. One of the best movies of the year.",Null,0,1,16 January 2003
Minority Report," IT JUST DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER.
","What if there was a system that could see the crimes before they happened. But then what if the system turned on you? Tom Cruise answers that question. He plays John Anderton, a dedicated cop who after his sons death has been married to his job has a cop using a system that could prevent crimes before they happen. And it becomes very successful. But when John looks at another vision and sees a man being murdered, and he also see its him killing the man. John soon runs for his life. Is he being set up or does he really kill this man?

","Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby a man who's head gets injured while trying to save his wife from a bunch of attackers. His wife dies. And Leonard can't make new memories. Leonard wants to avenge his wife's death. But who is he chasing. A well directed thriller, Christopher Nolan did a remarkable job.

Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also good.",Null,0,1,28 February 2002
Underworld," Nothing original, but still enjoyable.
","It's Blade and The Matrix all mixed up into one. Look at Kate Beckinsales attire in this movie, looks suprisingly similar. A good horror action movie. That definitly delivers the thrills. Kate Beckinsale plays Slena, a beautiful vampire warrior who hunts lycons(Werewolfs), but discovers something interesting during this endless war. I won't say what it is, you'll half to see the movie. You won't be dissapointed. I mean next to Blade and The Matrix you'll have a good time. Awesome action, made with gothicness. I hope there will be a sequel in the future!",Null,0,0,20 September 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The whole picture is Johnny Depp.
","I really mean it, he was givin everything to work on. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were not givin much of anything. Johnny Depp performance has the swashbuckling but unscrupulous Captain Jack Sparrow is cleverly funny and watchable. Orlando Bloom seems to allright as Will Turner, so does the beautiful Keira Knightly has Elizabeth Swann. And Geoffrey Rush as the leader of the cursed pirates is pretty good also. And the special effects are pretty awesome. But it's Johnny Depp that steals the picture the whole way.",Null,0,1,8 September 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," HOW TO SEAT THROUGH AN ENTERTAINING MOVIE?

Sometimes it makes you that they are a couple in real life. But we all know that they are not. But the chemistry is two perfect.",Null,0,1,9 February 2003
Insomnia," THIS GUY CROSS THE LINE, AND HE DID'NT EVEN BLINK.
","A good stylish thriller, it's no Memento. But it does okay. Great performances by Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Detective Will Dormer(Al Pacino) and his partner Hap Eckhart(Martin Donovan) go to a small town to investigate the murder of a teenage girl, who was beatin savagly.

Al Pacino was good has tough has nails detective Will Dormer. Robin Williams character is'nt bad, he goes way beyond bad. It was his best role in years.",Null,0,0,26 May 2002
X-Men," It's clearly Wolverine's movie.
","I remember this has a cartoon in the early 90's. I was very excited, when it was going to be a live action movie. And I was not disappointed. The characters come alive well, it's well directed by Bryan Singer. And well acted by everyone including Patrick Stewart has Professor X, who plays the part with a lot of charm and compassion. I first thought James Mardsen was a bad choice for the Cyclops, but he played the part pretty well. Famke Janssen was just quiet in the role of Jean Grey. Halle Berry should have had better lines playing Storm. Ian Mckellen was excellent has Magneto. But It's Hugh Jackman that clearly steals the picture as Wolverine, his performance has the charming rebel is very well acted. The special effects were awesome. Spider-Man did just has good at the box office. I hope DareDevil and The Hulk and also X-Men 2 do just has good?",Null,0,0,5 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Truly a great ending.
","The last and best of the trilogy. Luke and Leia have really matured in this one. It also has great scenary. Luke learns the truth about Darth Vader, and is told that he must face Darth Vader again, in order to become a jedi. Han Solo, Leia and crew go to a forest planet to knock down a shield that is for a new death star, that Lando Carrission and his crew must destroy.

Blade II," Twice the action, Twice the gore, Twice the fun,
","This was a better vampire movie then Queen of the Damned. Wesley Snipes is in top form has Blade, the tough half human half vampire hunter, who suddenly finds himself helping his sworn enemys, when a race of vampires ask for his help against a bigger enemy called The Reapers. With the help of Whistler(Yes he's back. And if you miss the beginning, you may miss the reason) they must defeat this new form of Vampires. Wesley Snipes is like a one man Matrix. The martial arts scenes were terrific. The action was incredible. If there will be a Blade 3? I'm there.",Null,0,1,22 March 2002
Elf," Holiday slapstick
","Will Ferrell is at his funniest. He plays Buddy, an ordinary human who was raised by elves in the North Pole at Santas workshop. When Buddy feels that he is not fitting in. He advised by elf stepfather(Bob Newhart) to go to New York City to find his real father named Walter Hobbs(James Caan). But Buddy has yet to discover that this world is very different from the world he grew up in. A great holiday movie since The Santa Clause. It's funny and touching, that makes you feel good about the holidays. A really must see",Null,0,1,16 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force just keeps stronger.
","The story is set a decade after The Phantom Menace. Soon to be Jedi Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) and his Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewen Mcgregor) are assigned to protect Padme Amidala(Natalie Portman). Who is now a senator. When there is a sudden atempt on her life. While Obi-Wan goes to investigate, Anakin and Padme start having feelings for each other. Great story telling by George Lucas. The Star Wars tales just keep getting better, At times Hayden Christensen seems to be over acting a bit, but he was still good. It was nice to see Samuel L. Jackson return. Phantom Menace was'nt that bad has critics made it out to be. But George Lucas made up for its glaring pot holes in this movie. We see Anakins letting his emotions run wild, for fans we all know we're that step is gonna go. Well Star wars fans make way for Episode 3 in 2005, and may the force be with you all.",Null,0,1,17 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Mike And Sully are the funniest animated team since Buzz and Woody
","John Goodman and Billy Crystal were the best choices to be the voices for Mike and Sully.When they drew these characters,they had them in mind. It was the best animated film I've seen in years next to Toy Story 1 and 2, and Shrek. The coolest animated world of monsters who scare kids for a living. And Mike(John Goodman) is the top scarier,with Sully his one eye buddy at his side. But what happpens when one of the kids get through there world? It could cause a lot of mayhem. Steve Buscemi is also good as the evil monster Randall Boggs. This film is for the whole family. I recommend it.",Null,0,1,13 January 2002
The Bourne Identity," BOURNE for action.
","What if you woke up one day, and you could'nt remember a thing about yourself. You don't know your name or your profession. We'll thats what Matt Damon in this movie tries to figure out why he has such good fighting skills, and does'nt know why he notices things to well, it's almost like he was trained too, and who is trying to kill him, and who is he all together? A good spy movie, that keeps you grabbing on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon gives a great performance. SO does Chris Cooper and Franka Potenta. Great action and great emotion. You won't be dissapointed.",Null,0,1,14 June 2002
Radio," IT'S JUST A TRULY GREAT FILM.
","I thought Uptown Girls was the most touching movies of 2003. But after seeing this movie, I now think it comes in a tie with Uptown Girls. It's perfectly well acted by Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. The story is set in 1976,football coach Harold Jones(Ed Harris) is hard drivin in pratice, he seems to have very little time for his wife and daughter(Debra Winger and Sarah Drew). But his view on life begins to change, when he meets James Robert Kennedy(Cuba Gooding Jr) who has a very slow learning process. Harold asks him to come to practice and help out a little. The two form a friendship, and Harold gives him the nickname Radio. But they soon begin to learn a lot from each other. A very beautiful film. That teaches us a lot about the human spirit. I shore hope that Cuba Gooding Jr gets nominated for an oscar.",Null,20,30,26 October 2003
Spider-Man," Spider-Man spins his web, and delivers a hit.
","Another Marvel classic. This movie is one big comic book. Tobey Maguire really looks the part of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, more then Nicholas Hammond did. Seeing Tobey in that role, it was like the character walked of the comic book. He does very well potraying Peter's kindness and awkwardness. Willem Dafoe is also good has Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, quite a memorable villian since Jack Nicholson in Batman. Kirsten Dunst is also good has Mary Jane. James Franco is great has Harry Osborn. The special effects are terrific. The movie has a sad note, no matter how many bad guys he'll stop or how many people he'll save, he'll always be haunted by the death of his uncle Ben, and the criminal he failed to stop. It was well acted by Maguire. The movie was great fun. It's for kids and adults. And who ever is big fan of the comic book. Well comic book fans Make way for next years The HULK.",Null,0,0,6 May 2002
The Transporter," JASON STATHAM IS THE NEXT BIG ACTION HERO.
","He could rival Vin Diesel and Jet Li. This is one of those movies you would hate to see end. Once it ends you'll be wanting more. For viewers if you loved XXX, then you'll really love The Transporter. It starts with Frank Martin(Jason Statham) a former U.S. Special Forces Soldier, now works has a Transporter for criminals or gangster. Frank's rules are never ask questions, don't give any names, and never open the package. And Frank gets paid well for his services. But what happens Frank breaks one of those rules? Next to XXX, The Transporter is the biggest action movie this year. Jason Statham plays the part well. For action fans, don't miss this one.",Null,1,2,12 October 2002

Con Air," Its Die Hard meets The Fugitive
",Nicholas Cage is good as Cameron Poe. He buffed up for the role.  But its the scene stealing John Malkovich has Cyrus the Virus pretty much takes the picture. His role as a crazy but smart prisoner is well performed. John Cusack is also good as Vince Larkin the nice but know-it-all D.E.A. The action almost never stops. The rest of the cast do well.

Jaws," Terror is still a classic.

And wants to close the beach down, but is told by the stubborn mayor(Murray Hamilton) of the small town, tells him that he can't shut the beach down without proof that it was shark, and also tells him that it might have been a boat accident.

Bruce Almighty," Good story, but the humor wears out quickly.
","Bruce Nolan(the very funny Jim Carrey) dreams of being a top news reporter, but he feels reality is quite cruel to him, when he receives none of the top assignments. Bruce becomes the bunt of everybodies jokes at work. The only good thing that seems to be in Bruces life is his girlfriend Grace(the beautiful Jennifer Aniston). But when Bruce has a very bad day, I mean where nothing seems to go right. Bruce blames god for everything. But god(very well played by Morgan Freeman) responds by giving Bruce all his powers, to see if he could do a better job at being the almighty. Started out funny, Jim Carrey was pretty funny. Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman were also good. But has the movie went on, it began to wear it self out. It started becoming less of nothing. I liked Jim Carreys performance in The Majestic then in this movie. But the dog in this movie was cute.",Null,0,0,25 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," This movie was eXcellent.
","The sequel that lives up to the original. But it has 10 times the action, and 10 times the special effects. I was glad that the cast from the first X-Men return in there title roles. Especially Hugh Jackman has Wolverine. Who always turns in a memorable performance. Alan Cumming really got into his role Nightcrawler. And delivers well. And Kelly Hu has Lady Deathstrike, who was a perfect choice. But Brian Cox takes most of the picture has the villianous LT. William Stryker. This movie is a comic book come to life. I hope X3 will be just has good?",Null,0,0,11 May 2003

The Breakfast Club," The film that started The Brat Pack craz.
","This film started it, St, Elmo's Fire made it higher. Out of all of John Hughes movies, this one really stands out. It's a teen classic. Great performances by Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, and Emilo Estevez. The story is about five different teenagers are forced to spend an all day Saturday detention. For some you may think it's about kids in detention, dive deeper into the story, you'll see a story of abuse, neglect, and the pressure to be perfect. What you see is what everyday teens go through. Thats what made the movie a hit. Although it was well acted by everyone, it's clearly Judd Nelson steals the picture, has the bad boy John Bender. Paul Gleason is also good has Richard Vernon, the not so likeable principal. He later went on to play characters we love to hate. This movie is funny and touching. It's my John Hughes favorite.",Null,1,2,4 June 2002

He sees a vision of a large rabbit, who starts convincing him to awful things, and has eerie predictions. Donnie begins to speak his mind, regardless of who it hurts. This was the most bizzare movie in years. It's American Beauty meets The Twlight Zone. Jake Gyllnhaal brings the Donnie Darko to life. When the cameras start rolling he is Donnie. He was really good. The lovely Jena Malone(best remembered from Stepmom) is also good has Donnie's love interest. She is a very descent actress. And the rest of the cast do well also. This movie has a lot of surprises. Even a surprise ending.",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
