The Blair Witch Project," Pretty good
","I can't understand why so many people can find this movie bad. There were points that left a little to be desired, but overall the film was actually scary. The main actors actually gave a feeling of tension during the film and the plot was good and well portrayed. Of course we didn't see anything. That was the point, you idiots. People still think that the actors are dead and missing to this day. That isn't just stupid people talking. The film was made right. The acting was good and if you can pull this thing off in eight day and $22,000 then you have talent. There were points that were long, I'll admit that. My main point is that the movie was creepy and well done. It may not have deserved all that it got. But it definitely earned your money theater or renting. Whether you think so or not.",8,0,1,3 June 2007
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","Am I the only one who hated how this went? I loved the first two Batman films. The third one was okay and I can even through the fourth one with a small sense of respect. Even though they tended to lean towards gadgets instead of character. But, really, am I the only one who hated how this prequel turned out? Some of the plot bugged me but what enraged me the most were the continuity errors and how the director thought changing everything was a smart idea. Forgive me for sounding like I'm a loser nerd but, come on.The Batmobile is iconic. From the very moment you are born you have seen the classic Batmobile. You know, the one that is just a rocket on wheels and resembles a bat in a vague sense? Not the one man tank that we thought 'Hey! We need a cool worthless over-sized weapon for the ten-year-olds to get memorized to. Not what has been set for years.' Let me put this simply. The reason Bruce's parents are dead is not because of the hungry hungry hobo it was Joker's fault. And Joker is not some loser who has a calling card that is meant to lead into another crappy movie.There's more but I'm gonna end that here. Even though a lot of stuff was tedious I can sit through trash and think I could watch that again. Not this There's a difference between creativity and destruction. But, thanks to all the nerds who decided that they needed more batman junk this loser is now going to continue his story line. In plain English this is no longer a prequel. It would be like (as if I didn't already sound like a loser) making a crappy prequel to Indiana Jones or Star Wars and continuing from there because you just wanted to remake a classic in your own eyes. And, unlike Psycho and The Shining, he's going to get away with it because he made a prequel.No offense to those huge fans of this movie. But you're idiots.",1,4,43,6 January 2007
The Number 23," Close but no cigar. Eh, I guess.
","I don't see what everyone's talking about. The movie was okay. I'm not someone who just sees voting as a two sided coin. The plot was okay. Te people who hated it are all saying the same thing. Dull. No, it wasn't that dull. It just needed to end a tad sooner. and I mean 'tad'. It missed the runway and ended on the beach. It did keep me interested. I am not going with the others that say they can't sleep anymore thanks to this wonderful piece of cinema. I liked it but it was no changeling. It was not a brand new psycho. Somethings you catch quickly and some take time. NED. And, by the way, it's not that easy. I've tried. It is not an easy number. Just simply, meh. It's not god over all movies but it isn't trash. Stop all the jeering, stop all the cheering.",6,2,4,5 March 2007
30 Days of Night," Oh my God! It's the same old crap. With a new title.
","It's official! The horror movie genre has fallen into an annoying cliché hole from which it will never emerge. This movie was just the latest in a long line of disappointing horror crap. It takes the best ideas from other more famous (better) horror films and throws them into a pot and says 'There, I'm being creative. Right? Anybody? Hello?' Don't believe me? Fine. 1. Dark ashy color: Brought into horror vogue by The Ring. 2. Jerky fight scenes: Brought into horror movie vogue by 28 Days Later. 3. General poor camera work: Blair Witch. They were creative and were rewarded as such. So why not steal it? 4. WAAAAAAAY (I really cannot possibly show my rage with that word) too much gore: Gore amount has been building for a long time but do we really need it? Yes, we all bleed but this just shows WAY too much of it with no purpose other than 'I think it makes it scarier.' 5. Loud bangs: Old cliché. But still, I want to be SCARED. As in frighten me, creep me out, disturb me. MY REFLEXES ARE FINE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN, NOW STOP IT. Just because I jump doesn't mean I'm scared. May I ask what the Hell is wrong with Hollywood now? Every genre now has a crutch and lacks creativity. This movie sucked because its components sucked. How can you have such a good plot idea and then perform it so blowfully? I can't believe that Hollywood will never produce another good movie again. This bites. I would have been proud to have been a part of a film like The Silence of the Lambs or The Shining or Scream or The Ring even if it meant doing a crappy job like janitor or best boy. Very proud. I wouldn't have signed onto this movie as the lead actor for a contract worth 50 million. Mainly because I would never work again if I did. But also because I have higher respect for myself than that. And if you have even the slightest amount of self respect you won't see this movie. You are paying to see a showcase of the same old crap.",2,1,4,4 October 2008
WALL·E," Pretty-Perfect Film
","WALL-E................WALL-E, WALL-E, WALL-E, where to start, where to start? First off, the animation was incredible. I don't think it better then other 2D or 3D movies because of animation, because that would just be pointless. But I thought it was just brilliantly animated, at times even tricking my eyes into thinking it was a real live action movie. Not often, but enough.Now, as everyone SHOULD know, good animation does not a decent movie make. It gets points, but not A's. The plot was good. It was sent into space and punctuated by emotion and a message but overall it was just a standard love story. But most entertainment stories are love stories. The Matrix was part love story for God's sakes. It was a unique love story in that it was put together with only two near-mute characters and how they function together.The most interesting part of this movie is ow well emotion was worked into it. By using the animation, yes back to the animation, the animators intricately make it so that WALL-E's eyes move up and down like eyebrows and one can see that deep inside the frames there are metal circles that go over his inner eyes similar to eyelids. It's interesting when EVE freezes and WALL-E works with her like that. A very 'Twilight-Zone-Last-Man-On-Earth' kind of scenario. Usually the only emotion shown on a Disney movie is the helpless girl crying over her love leaving or how how much she screwed up. (Sorry, ladies, it's just how stories have historically gone.)The voices are good being that there is more audio dialogue in an early Charlie Chaplin film then there is in this movie. I like how there we're several intricate and important characters that had so much to say that really couldn't say ANYthing. Pretty gutsy move for a kids film. There are really only four normal characters that use normal voices.Message.... The movie was really good, but it just got really preachy. People are L-A-Z-Y and nobody, I repeat, NOBODY, can deny it. But really, Disney? Did we need the ending to be the animated version of 'An Inconvenient Truth'? I love the message, but maybe not so heavy in a kids flick, alright? There has to be some irony in the global Disney corporation having an anti company message in a movie.To cap it all off, one can't really say that the ending was realistic. Yes, I know it's a Disney flick. Yes, I know it's a movie about us living in space, which ain't gonna happen, sorry Trekkies and Star Wars losers. But come on, everything is hunky dory and the world continues on with humans for the better? Doubt it.Overall, good flick. It's hands down no questions asked going to win the Oscar. Sorry, Kung Fu Panda. Is it better than Beauty and the Beast? No. Lion King? No. Shrek? No. Finding Nemo? No. But is it a really good film that deserves ALMOST every bit of praise it gets (as long as critics keep their heads on)? Yes. So overall, I give this film a B+ to an A-. Which is higher than most other films of today. Probably because it's better than most films of today.",8,2,6,3 July 2008
