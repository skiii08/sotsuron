First Man," Get out of their faces!
","Close-up, after close-up, after close-up. The director of photography should be dragged outside and tarred and feathered. As if the capsule scenes weren't claustrophobic enough, did every scene with the actors have to be so tightly cropped? Gosling is not a serious actor - his portrayal of a true American hero was exhausting. Also, why do directors these days cast actors in roles of real historical people that do not even closely resemble them (Buzz Aldrin excluded)? It makes it hard to follow who is who, especially since a lot of the characters are not well developed at all. Skip it at the cineplex and watch it on video.",3,207,370,13 October 2018
A Star Is Born," A Total Mess
","This remake of a remake - made many times before, has nothing to offer the viewer except possibly a peek into today's cultural obsession into victim hood, and yes, the ridiculous idea of toxic masculinity. First of all the chemistry between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper is like ether, it is there, barely, as it unfolds from scene to scene and then it is gone, evaporated into the unknown. It is almost painful to watch, actually it is painful, and the fact that Cooper delivers his lines with his head down most of the time and that Lady Gaga needs another few semesters of acting classes makes for a very looooong two plus hours of cinematic purgatory. Aside from the obstacles of not having any memorable scenes and a wooden performance from Gaga there is this nagging concession that what one is watching is some writer's excruciating attempt to rewrite a simple love story so that it incorporates all the political and cultural angst that we must all be burdened with in the early 21st century. Imagine that , the lead female role falling in love with a man after declaring how much she hates men in an early scene, and throughout the movie incessantly goes on a ball-busting campaign until he buckles under the abuse and fights back with some very hurtful words. Folks, at this point this gets very difficult to watch. Especially since the tale is such a simple tragedy, it just topples under its own weight ufortunately. Finally, the music was mediocre at best. Now I'm not saying the soundtrack from the last remake was earth shattering but with so much hype, and focus on production you would think the producers would have spent the cash to hire top notch hit writers. Not here. All in all a dud.",1,5,8,4 March 2019
A Quiet Place," One HUGE plot hole from outer space
","There are already enough reviews here to point out how bad the story of this movie is. One plot hole after another, I'm still coming up with some five hours later. There is just one more thing to add. The father displays such ingenuity - why hasn't he come up with an effective defense system and a strategy to go on the offensive against these creatures? During the movie you see that the family is growing large quantities of crops. If they have the ability to do that then they must have close access to the materials to build a fortification and a weapons system to defeat them. Oh, and here is one more plot hole I can't resist telling about. How in the world did they harvest all that corn in the grain silo without making any noise and there is a field full of growing corn as well. And why would you spend so much time and effort 'silently' growing enough corn to feed a small town for a year for a family of four? Okay, yeah I get it, the movie is tense and thrilling in ways, but that is only because the characters are reckless, careless, and just plain dumb. If that is what it takes to make a horror film these days then I refuse to suspend disbelief for 1.5 hours. The director has to do his part too.",4,32,61,11 April 2018
