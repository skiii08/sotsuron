Skyfall," No logic, no comedy, no thrills, no fun: not a Bond movie
","I didn't enjoy the movie and found the plot lacking common sense in most places. I want to highlight the following points:How the hell does bond not die after being hit by the bullet from Moneypenny and falling into a river? So many illogical scenes throughout. How the villain comes with so many people? This guy is an x agent and is obviously crazy. How did he form an army? Where did he get the money? How did he hack into the most secure computers when he had no technical knowledge? In the scene he blows the metro train into Bond, how come he had a bomb planted exactly there? Did he know Bond was going to accost him at exactly that point? How come Bond lets his girl die?I mean, I don't want to be a stickler for logic but this one really lack s it. Also of course there are no thrills, comedy or entertainment! Unlike the previous Bond movies such as Casino Royale!",1,8,16,5 June 2014
