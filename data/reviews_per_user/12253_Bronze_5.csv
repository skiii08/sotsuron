E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An outstanding film
",E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is an excellent film that everyone should see sometime in their lifetime. John Williams' score for E.T. is one of the best ever written and every single award E.T. got E.T. deservedMy Score   9.9/10,10,1,2,20 August 1998
L.A. Confidential," L. A. Confidential vs. Titanic
","Acting: Kim Basinger got an oscar for her performance to prove that L. A. Confidential has better acting. Titanic got two nominations but even those performances were not the best they could have been.Directing: Curtis Hanson got the nomination but Cameron the oscar. Why? Cameron's movie was more popular. Curtis Hanson was able to direct scenes so that they flowed together. In L. A. Confidential all of the scenes came together. In Titanic it was going from one scene to the next except it never flowed and never particularly came together.Screenplay: The screenplay in L. A. Confidential was cutting edge, straight at you, and perfection. In Titanic. ' I'm just a tumbleweed blowing in the wind 'Musical Score: The score for L. A. Confidential went right along with the movie. There was never a moment when the music did not draw you into the scene. With Titanic it only distracted me. I also recognized several of the melodies from other songs.So why did Titanic beat L. A. Confidential for the Best Motion Picture oscar? Popularity. My Score 10/10",10,0,0,28 July 1999
American Beauty," It makes an impression
",I have one thing to say about this film. That is: It's impact rivals that of Schindler's List. Everything in this film was phenomenal. From Kevin Spacey and Sam Mendes to the extras. This film definitely deserved more than just five oscars.,9,0,0,1 June 2000
Schindler's List," It is great with passion
",Martin Scorsese was right. A jewish director could do a better job. Steve Spielberg made this the best film anyone could make it. Everything about it was done with great care and great respect for the 11 million victims of the Holocaust. The acting was also done with care and respect. Liam Neeson playing Schindler had the best male performance while Anna Mucha ( Danka Dresner ) and Embeth Davidth ( Helen Hirsh ) had the best female performances.Although it isn't a film you would enjoy seeing you should see. Just so you can find out what really happened in the Holocaust.,10,9,19,25 February 1999
Titanic," It deserved half of what it got
","Titanic was a good movie indeed but it was Leo that gave the film a wrong impression. Titanic got 11 oscars but didn't really deserve most of them so I have included the oscars Titanic got and who it should have gone to Art/Set Direction should have gone to Tianic Costume Design should have gone to Titanic Cinematography should have gone to The Wings of the Dove Director should have gone to James Cameron Original Score should have gone to Phillip Glass for Kundun Original Song should have gone to Titanic Visual Effects should have gone to Starship Troopers Sound should have gone to Titanic Sound Effects Editing should have gone to Titanic Best Picture should have gone to Good Will HuntingIf you don't agree with me that's fine, I will let you have your own opinions but I still think the public has been very unfair to other films",8,1,1,14 August 1998
