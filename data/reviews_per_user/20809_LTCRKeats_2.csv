United 93," Sometimes the person who has to 'do something' is you.
","A legitimate tribute to common citizens, who, when faced with the realization that death may be imminent, chose to fight back and possibly save others while they are at it.The characters are not known actors. Each person was asked to read a bio of their character so they might be able to do a better job of being them, not simply being a good actor. Some of the flight controllers and military people are the real people who did those jobs on 9/11. It dramatically increases the realism.The movie is real time. The characters don't know anything more than they did at that time on 9/11. No patriotic speeches. No over the top action heroes. No ultimate evil villains. Real people. Muslim terrorists doing their deed, not cartoon characters. Scared people doing the best they can in a terrible situation.You owe it to yourself to see this movie. It will make you ask yourself if you would have had the courage to act as these common citizens did. It will remind you that there are people perfectly willing to kill any American, man, woman or child. They don't care, they just want to kill us.This movie puts real life into a situation you can understand.",10,2,5,15 May 2006
The Departed," Betrayal at its zenith.
","The Departed is excellent entertainment from some of America's best actors and one of its best directors. Not a totally believable story line, but who cares? It was believable enough to entertain and not lose the audience. It allowed good actors to do excellent work.The basic story is the head of the Boston Mob (Nicholson)plants an informant in the Massachusetts State Police (Damon)and the State Police plant an informant in the mob (DiCaprio). Both sides figure out there is an inside informant and go looking. The chase and final chapter are great action and great drama. The final 5 minutes are not what you expect which adds to the fun and entertainment. If you have trouble with blood and bad language, this is not your movie. The language and blood are not inappropriate to the story, these are mobsters not school kids.Jack Nicholson is still Jack Nicholson. With the right part, he is still one of the best. Matt Damon is wonderful as the mole and does some of his best acting. His character has no conscience and that fits the part. DiCaprio is a more difficult and troubled character, but he carries it well. Wahlberg (a state trooper supervisor) is an unlikable jerk, but does redeem himself in the end.If you go to movies to be entertained and enjoy a mobster movie, don't miss this one.",9,3,6,10 October 2006
