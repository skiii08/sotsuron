Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This CGI filled mess is the lowest point of the Star Wars franchise
","Star Wars Marathon Movie #1 (Keep in mind, I watched the anti-cheese edition, which got rid of the more cringe worthy parts of this movie. There is a full list of changes in the description of the video on YouTube)The anti-cheese edition made the movie a little bit better by getting rid of the filler scenes and made all of the aliens speak an alien language with subtitles. This was great for getting rid of Jar Jar and making the Trade Federation guys not sound like whinny idiots.The filler scenes that were removed made for a more interesting story and got rid of all of the fart jokes and horrible dialogue. The downside to this is that the filler scenes that were removed sometimes led to awkward transitions between scenes and an awkward pacing to the story.Even with this edit, Star Wars 1 remains the worst of the series. The anti-cheese edit made it more enjoyable, but it still grew boring and dull. If you must watch Star Wars 1, watch the anti- cheese edit, otherwise skip it.Damn this movie sucks, why was it even made?",4,1,8,13 December 2015
The Equalizer," Good movie, could have been better
","Older black John Wick does good things for people as the antagonist from xXx hunts him down.In all seriousness The Equalizer has some good action, good cinematography at times, and it was entertaining. I marked it down because some of the dialog is not delivered great, and the story was a little generic and predictable.The way John Wick handles it by not screwing around with a story and just getting right into was the way it should be done. The story of this felt like it was trying to give him a purpose to do these things, when you could have just done them from one incident.It also tries to tell you why he got out of the businesses, they give you his whole backstory. John Wick implies it, which it great, it leaves some mystery.Overall, good movie, but John Wick did it better. I won't be buying it, but will probably watch it a second or third time. If Nicolas Winding Refn would have stayed and directed it, it would have been great.",7,1,2,17 July 2015
Child 44," The only thing good about his movie was Tom Hardy's performance
","The story was all over the place. What seemed like it should be the main story, felt like a side story. The movie focused more on what was happening to the main character than the murder mystery. None of the events happening were interesting either.The main antagonist was bad just to be bad. They never established a reason why this guy hated the main character, he just did. All the characters where underdeveloped, except the main character who actually had some character progression throughout the movie.The camera work was horrible. There were never any good shots that intrigued me and everything was shot bad. The actions scenes had so much shaky cam I couldn't tell what was happening for the majority of any fight scene throughout the movie.This movie was bad. It was long and it bored me. The most interesting part, which was them trying to track down the murderer was pawned off as a side story that had an abrupt end and had me feeling like nothing had been resolved. The only thing that carried me through this movie was Tom Hardy's performance, he stole the screen whenever he was there. But not even Tom Hardy could save this movie from being bad.",5,3,10,24 July 2015
Akira," I really wanted to like this movie
","I really wanted to like this movie, I heard from everyone that it was an anime classic and I had seen screenshots that looked really cool. In the end I was disappointed.The movie was hand drawn and it looked amazing no doubt about that, I could stare at still from this movie all day long, it's the other things that bothered me.The story is a mess. I loved the first act, seeing this cyberpunk city was really cool, seeing the gangs and everything. After that the movie turned into a anime horror movie, which I don't feel fit the tone at all. The whole Akira thing was confusing as hell, they never explained it, everyone was asking the whole movie 'What is Akira?' The third act dragged out so much, things that were happening didn't make sense at all. The end was just a mess with destruction everywhere, but no story to tell about it.The soundtrack was also annoying. Some of the songs were cool, but they play them almost 7 or 8 times in the movie, which wears out the song and just makes it ambient noise.This might be only the English dub, but the dubbing was horrible. The words were off the mouth movements and the voice actors were bad. In intense scenes the voice actors never gave an intense feel.For a classic there were some big problems. The story could have been more direct and made more sense. In fact, they could have just made the movie about the city and the gangs fighting and that would have made it better. With the movie how it is, they could have cut it down to take out the dragging on of the end. Akira just ended up losing my interest near the end, making it not as interesting as I thought it would be.",6,13,24,19 August 2015
Creed," Creed was entertaining and a good addition to the Rocky mythos
","Michael B Jordan did a great job and Stallone was also pretty good (you could actually understand what he was saying). The chick from Dear White People was okay, nothing that stood out.The story is where I had problems. While it was interesting and a good way to make a spin off I felt like they tried too hard to separate it from the rest of the movies.Constantly throughout the movie they remind you in many ways that Rocky is old. After a few times it got annoying. They also keep reminding you that the main character is Apollo Creed's son. I get that it was part of the story that he wanted to create his own legacy, but almost every 15 to 20 minutes they remind you that he is Creed's son.The romance arc of the movie didn't feel right for the movie, it was a side story that wasn't needed.Mainly, Creed was a good movie, I would recommend it, but had problems that annoyed me. The story constantly reminds you of things instead of assuming you know it, that got annoying and took me out of the movie. Good movie, but had annoying story problems.",7,0,3,2 December 2015
Ant-Man," It's not the best Marvel movie, but one of the better ones.
","The story was a little predictable, but enough to look past that little problem. The villain didn't seem fleshed out enough, I would have liked to see more of him and learn more about why he does what he does. This problem could be fixed in a Marvel Short. The main character, Scott Lang, was likable and I felt fore him and his cause. Hope was bitchy through like half the movie then just changes in an instant after a single event, this could have been fleshed out more. Also the comedic parts were abrupt sometimes and cut into dramatic scenes, this felt out of place and distracting.The acting of the side characters were great, Michael Pe√±a was funny, T.I. was funny and David Dastmalchian's character had a bad accent, but it was funny. Michael Douglas did great acting, and Evangeline Lilly overacted in some parts, but still did good throughout most of the movie.The camera work was OK, the only really cool parts where when he was small, the rest of the time it was just OK.Ant-Man was a good movie, worth a watch, and I will buy it. It feels more like a comedy movie than an action Marvel movie, but since it was written by comedic writers that wasn't hard to figure out. It was a fun time and it was a good break from all the Marvel movies that feel like all they have to be is action.",7,1,4,27 July 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," This is my favorite David Fincher movie
","The story follows James Bond as he attempts to solve a murder mystery on a island with the help of Rooney Mara (I couldn't think of a role everyone would know her from). The story is filled with suspense, character development, a rich world around them, and disturbing scenes that are unforgettable.While Gone Girl follows a great murder mystery too, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's performances stuck with me a little bit more. James Bond was amazing with the dark character he portrayed, along side Rooney Mara it combined to gave way to some great scenes. The two made every scene intense and interesting as they sucked you in.The camera work, as per usual in David Fincher movies, is amazing. I can't really describe the cinematography without rambling on, so just watch it and you'll know what I would say.The soundtrack is amazing! Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross made an amazing score that added to every scene. The ambient noise and pulsing bass made scenes really intense and memorable. P.S. If you have a surround sound system, get ready to have your ears blown out from the bass.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo remains to be my favorite David Fincher movie. The dark atmosphere, story, and everything else stated above combined to make a amazing movie.",9,0,0,10 October 2015
Inside Out," Pixar has failed again to capture what made them great
","The characters were bland, you could tell how they were going to act in every situation. You couldn't connect with the main girl because she didn't even feel like a character in the movie. The emotions acted the same every time and never changed.The story was the most predictable thing I have ever watched. In the first 30 minutes you know exactly what is going to happen throughout. The story dragged near the end and left me just wanting the movie to end already. Not to mention this movie rehashes every theme and story element done in other the other Pixar movies, but not as well.This movie is made for kids, yes. That does not make it good. It was borderline okay and suffered from many problems, better luck to Pixar next time, please make a good movie again.",5,17,50,28 November 2015
No Country for Old Men," You don't need this review, just go watch the movie already
","The Coen Brothers never cease to amaze me. They also paired up with my favorite cinematographer, Roger Deakins to bring one of my favorite movies.My only complaints about the film are that it feels long at points. The suspense keeps you sucked in and I feel that the length was needed to tell the whole story, but during some of the scenes I felt like the movie just kept going. Also there was one bad performance in the whole movie, and it was Garret Dillahunt, he was overacting in almost every scene he is in, while surrounded by good actors.The plot is simple and easy to follow, but is truly brought to life by the two main characters. Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh was the silent killer, every scene he was in felt intense, you never knew what he was going to do. Even on a second viewing the scenes with Javier Bardem were still very intense. Josh Brolin's character Llewelyn Moss was the man running away. I felt for him every step of the way, I wanted him to succeed and that is good.Overall, this movie is great. The acting is great despite that one actor and the story is great and is filled with intense scenes. The cinematography is great with so many great shots, but what else can you expect from the master Roger Deakins. You won't be disappointed watching this movie.",8,1,1,18 July 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," I don't really get why people love this movie so much
","It was a typical teen romance drama. It had it's good moments, but there were very few. For the most part the movie just contained sappy and awkward moments. It felt like the movie was trying to make you cry instead of having it happen naturally.The characters were very weak and mostly stayed with the same motives and barely changed as people. Since their characters never really changed it made the story predictable. Just see how their characters act and feel and you can see all the clich√©s and how the story will proceed.The acting wasn't that great either. I have seen both of these actors in other movies where they were much more believable. Shailene Woodley was great in White Bird in a Blizzard and The Spectacular Now. Ansel Elgort wasn't the best actor along Shailene Woodley either, she overshadowed him, which didn't make for good chemistry.To me the only redeeming part was the soundtrack, which was mostly indie music which fit the mood most of the time.The Fault in Our Stars is a generic teen romance movie. Nothing new comes out of this movie. The little redeeming qualities made me give it a better score than it deserves.",6,2,4,14 September 2015
Good Will Hunting," Great story and performances all around
","I seriously love this movie. It is a amazing movie.The story is original and great. The acting is great, it sucks me in everything I watch the movie. The camera work is great and the movie has some great shots.Good Will Hunting is definitely a feel good movie, you just can't help having a smile on your face at the end of the movie. The movie is amazing.I watched it again for Robin Williams and his performance is great, it makes me sad every time I see his face on screen and that just adds to his performance.",9,1,4,21 July 2015
Rocky," After seeing Creed I had to watch Rocky
","The story showed the upbringing of an underdog. You can connect and feel the struggles of his character throughout the movie. The love interest didn't feel tacked on at all, you see Rocky find someone who understands him and is by his side. The scene with him admitting his fears to her is one of my favorite scenes in the entire movie.The camera work was okay, but given the time and budget I'll give that a pass. Made on a budget of 1.1 million there were cuts that had to be made. There are scenes with contrast and continuity errors, but not enough to be considered bad.There wasn't a lot of music in this movie, but when there was it was great, sometimes simple is better.Rocky is the original great boxing movie. Even with some camera problems, the story and experience eclipsed it. A must watch for any fan of film.",8,1,1,6 December 2015
Sicario," God damn is the only way I can describe this movie.
","The story follows a FBI agent who is working with a group to go after a Mexican drug lord. The story is interesting, but the middle of the movie felt a little dragged out or long, I can't really describe it. But the movie was plenty of moments that make up for that. Now, I have to talk about the intense scenes, Jesus! If you have seen Prisoners, by the same director, you know he can do intense scenes, but Sicario... has intense scenes, ones you forget anytime soon.The acting was amazing, I wouldn't be surprised if some or all of the actors get put up for Golden Globes or Oscars, because they deserve it. Emily Blunt did great, possibly her best performance yet. Benicio Del Toro again, did an amazing job, he just keeps getting better and better. I could go on, but it would be to long.Now I can't do a review without talking about Roger Deakins. The master, my idol. This man is amazing. Every single shot was nice, crisp, and sucked you in. Even the scenes at night, felt like they were night time. During the night you couldn't perfectly see peoples faces and there were silhouettes. Unlike some movies that try and emulate night time, this actually felt like night time. I can't describe the shots in this movie, so many are great and deserve frames up on the wall.The Soundtrack was also very good. The ambient, pulsing sounds and even silence added to the atmosphere of the whole movie. The soundtrack fit perfectly with the film and made scenes. They did a great job.I liked Sicario, it was a great movie. I feel like I need to watch it again though to fully feel my thoughts. The middle that felt a bit long winded might have been because of the annoying ass guy with popcorn next to me in the theater, so if I see it another time it may not feel this way. The movie is definitely worth a trip to the theater.",8,1,4,1 October 2015
Lucy," The movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good.
","The story is really simple and stupid. Not to mention characters explain the story every step of the way like we are stupid. There is no lead up she just gets thrown into this situation, drugs get opened in her, she starts accessing more of her brain. They tell you everything she will be able to do and they tell you whenever she reaches a new level, it's simple.The acting was bad. Most of the people delivered bad lines in monotone voices. I just saw actors, not characters.The CG was horrible. Monkeys, cars crashing, people. They all looked bad.There was no tension in any scene. She says from the beginning that she can't feel pain, so nothing worries me, she just walks through guys.There were some good camera shots, but nothing to rave about.Lucy had a weak structure, but it stood. The first 2 actions scenes were cool, but it was because she hadn't reached god level yet. After that it was OK. Some of the things she was able to do was cool, but the context ruined it, those ideas would have fit better in a space/alien movie.By the way, she turns into a USB drive at the end. 100% brain capacity = USB. I'm not kidding, it;s stupid. They couldn't think of how to end the story so she became a USB. Let that sink in.",5,0,5,21 August 2015
Godzilla," This is the Godzilla movie we should have gotten in 1998
","Though this is in no way a really good movie, I enjoyed it. Godzilla 14' entertained me until the end. I have seen every single Godzilla movie and this isn't even close to the worst ones.The story is kinda bad. This movie focuses more on the humans than Godzilla, which I don't have a problem with, since they have done it in past Godzilla movies that were good. The problem with it focusing on the humans though it that the characters are plain and generic. They never fleshed out the humans enough for me to care about them and they made stupid choices turn after turn. Not to mention dialogue have continuity errors. Again they have done this in past Godzilla movies.The acting was meh. Bryan Cranston gave the best performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson was not that great, he just kinda stared and said things that furthered the plot. Elizabeth Olsen was just there as a plot device, she didn't have many lines. Ken Watanabe was just there to stare, talk about Godzilla, and correctly pronounce Gojira. Sally Hawkins was there for like 5 scenes and in every one she was annoying.The camera work was good though. There were some nice shots that showed chaos throughout the city, the soldiers, the monsters, and hat HALO jump. One thing is for sure, it didn't look bad at all.The soundtrack is great too. The music makes you feel like you're in every situation and lends great to the Godzilla theme.Godzilla 14' was OK, but the dark and gritty feel won me over to give it a 7/10. The movie wasn't horrible like people say it is, but it isn't a masterpiece. It is just a cool monster movie that is entertaining. If we would have gotten this in 98' no one would have complained. I really hope they improve upon this to make a great sequel, I can't wait to see Ghidorah in action again.",7,1,2,28 July 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," I can't believe I waited so long to watch it
","Inside Llewyn Davis has become one of my favorite Coen Brother's movies.The story was very simple, which I felt was needed for this story, too much complicated things would have made it confusing. Some side stories ended abruptly, which I didn't like, but small enough to look over.The acting was good, Oscar Isaac was the stand out performance while the others were OK. There were some scenes where it was hard to understand Oscar Isaac or the other characters though.The camera work was great. There were so many nice shots that they captured my eyes immediately. I don't believe there was one scene that didn't look good in this movie. There was some noir feel to some scenes while others felt light hearted and bright.Inside Llewyn Davis is a very heart felt and personal movie. Personally, I don't see it reaching to the mainstream audience, but I do see it being a cult film that will be remembered for a long time. People may think this movie looks stupid, but when watching it you can see the effort and love that had been put into this movie. Inside Llewyn Davis is a great movie, I loved it.",8,0,2,27 July 2015
