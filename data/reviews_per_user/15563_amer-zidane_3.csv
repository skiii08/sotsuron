The Shining," Overrated! Slow and not Scary by any means
","I was extremely disappointed after watching the Shining, was expecting a masterpiece from the man who made A Clockwork Orange, but the movie had an inconsistent time line and there was no real build up to the story and you just get right into the insanity of Jack with no proper introduction.Really not worth all the fuzz about it",6,14,23,11 December 2018

","Couldn't figure out what was the message from the movie, mediocre at best.",5,37,76,12 June 2020
