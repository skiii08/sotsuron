Catch Me If You Can," Don't Miss This:
","Certainly one of the better movies in 2002.  I thought this was Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance to date.  Of course what can you not like about Tom Hanks, one of the finest actors in history.  Have you ever noticed how Tom Hanks continues to select the right vehicles to perform in.  Excellent story line with outstanding production values.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie.  I rated this an 8.",8,1,2,29 December 2003
To Be or Not to Be," A CLASSIC
","A delightful spoof of Adolph Hitler.  Filmed early during World War II, the movie was probably several generations before its time.  Great cast including Jack Benny, Carole Lomard, Robert Stack, Lionel Atwill and Tom Dugan among others.  Jack Benny's facial expressions alone are worth watching this great film.",9,8,23,8 July 2002
Erin Brockovich," Must See
","A different type of character for Julia Roberts, but as usual she turns in a great performance, enhanced by the fine supporting role of Albert Finney. This is a movie that everyone needs to see to help appreciate the many complexities of our life today.  Certainly a film which should be considered in the 'Best Picture' category for the year.  Strong language makes it for adults only.  I rated this 8.",8,0,1,1 November 2000
As Good as It Gets," Nicholson and Hunt sparkle together
",Destined to become a film classic and very possibly one of the ten best films ever made.  Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt sparkle together with true Academy Award performances.  The supporting cast is strong and Nicholson's one liners are worth viewing alone.  Recommended for all ages.  In 30 years this still will be on everyone's viewing list.  It doesn't get any better than this.,10,0,0,21 August 2000
Gettysburg," First Rate TV movie:
","Originally made by Turner Pictures for TV this movie is exceptionally well done.  An accurate reproduction of the Gettysburg fighting, coupled with fine performances from this group of professional actors.  The graphic scene's of the battle only enhance a superior TV production.",8,0,0,31 December 2002
U-571," Excellent
","One of the better submarine pictures to come along.  Loosely based on the true story of a 'British' submarine adventure in the Second World War, the movie tends to be extremely well made with a very good cast.  One of the more realistic movies showing what submarine life was really like.  Some great underwater scenes.  For the whole family I rated this an 8, unusually high for me to rate a movie.",8,0,1,31 October 2000
Independence Day," Excellent graphics
","Excellent graphics and a professional cast giving good performances make this a worth your time film.  Story line borrowed from several other movies like 'War of The Worlds', and 'Battlestar Galatica'.",7,1,2,16 June 1999
Seabiscuit," Great Story:
","This movie starts very slowly and is somewhat uneven.  About half way through, the script tightens and the story flows more evenly.  A superb cast, lead by the always strong performance from Jeff Bridges makes this a Very Good movie.  I recommend this for all ages.  I rated Seabisquit at 7+.",7,0,0,29 December 2003
Patton," The Very Best:
","I consider Patton the very best war movie ever made.  It is highly unusual for a movie to tell a better story then the book, but this is the case with Patton.  Casting was superb.  I could imagine know one capturing the General Patton's character better then George C. Scott.  Certainly this was Scott's defining moment of an outstanding film career.  The battlefield scene of the General kissing the young tank Captain is one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history.  I remember seeing this movie in 1970 and being shock at the profanity it contained.  Movies have come a long way since then. Recommended for all, as a accurate portrayal of some of the events of the Second World War.  This is one of only 3 movies I have ever felt deserved a big 10 rating.  Enjoy.",10,1,5,23 January 2004
Die Hard," Very Violent
","This very good film probably could have been successful with a little less violence.  An interesting story line with enough suspense and plot twists to hold everyone's interest.  Willis gives a fine performance, despite some weak dialog at times.  An excellent supporting cast insured this a good flick to spend your time with.",7,0,2,20 August 2000
The Great Escape," Very Good War Movie
","This is an interesting and true story and like so many of the epics in the early 60's, has a great cast.  Probably Steve McQueen's best film work. Most viewer's will find it worth the 2 hours and 50 plus minutes you spend with the flick.  Recommended for all, I rated this an 8.",8,5,7,9 November 2003
Gladiator," Well done but overrated !
","I was a little disappointed in this movie, what with all its Academy Award hype.  This was a good movie, well worth your time but this was not a great movie.  The story line was borrowed from a half dozen different movies depicting gladiators.  The acting was professional  but the only Academy Award performance I saw was Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and that part was so small it had no impact on the film.  Definitely not family fare as it is very bloody from start to finish.  Preview this movie but it would become very tiring in any film library.  I rated this a 7.",7,0,0,21 April 2001
