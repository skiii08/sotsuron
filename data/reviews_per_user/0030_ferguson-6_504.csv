Ford v Ferrari," feel the vroom!
","Greetings again from the darkness. 7000 RPM. Racing legend Carroll Shelby describes that as the moment of racing bliss in the opening of the film. We are reminded of early test pilots breaking the sound barrier, or explorers reaching the peak of Mt. Everest. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of history, rivalries, egos, and sport. The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era. An era that wasn't about fairness and feelings, but of determination and focus that produced results - either success or failure. There were winners and losers, and the ceremonies awarded no participation ribbons.Who are these men? They are Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Henry Ford II, and Enzo Ferrari. Director James Mangold (LOGAN, WALK THE LINE) takes the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and turns it into a rivalry between car makers, a friendship between racing icons, a look at corporate buffoonery that still exists today, and an old-fashioned movie that is fun to watch ... regardless of whether you know the first thing about racing or cars.Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the war veteran race driver-turned-designer hired to push Ford racing into world class status. Shelby is an industry icon who won the 1959 Le Mans before retiring due to a heart condition. He then founded and ran Shelby-American for designing and improving cars. He wore cowboy hats that were only eclipsed in size by his bravura in most situations. Christian Bale plays legendary driver Ken Miles, another war veteran and bombastic friend of Shelby, who can best be described as a race car savant. Contrary to the film's title, the story belongs to these two men, and the film belongs to these two actors.Co-writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller take some liberties with the script and bend a few historical details to make the parts fit a Hollywood production ... but for the most part, the story is pretty accurate. Just a few years after the Edsel fiasco, Henry Ford II is agitated at the state of Ford Motor Company, and after a bitter and personally insulting failed buyout of Ferrari, Mr. Ford (played with proper arrogance by Tracy Letts) decides to engage in motor-measuring with the Italian company run by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). He hires Shelby to elevate Ford racing to elite status with one main goal - beating Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby's cocksure approach manages to keep Miles onboard despite the internal battles with Ford executives, especially Leo Beebe (a smarmy Josh Lucas). Beebe doesn't see Miles as 'a Ford man', and in what is all too common in corporate life, prefers style over substance.The film could have easily been titled Corporate vs Cars. Although the Henry Ford vs Enzo Ferrari segment is quite entertaining, most of the time is spent with Shelby and Miles trying to reach their dream while negotiating corporate obstacles. These two men have a love for racing and each other - in an old school, manly-respect kind of way. They are simpatico in their quest for the perfect car, and as Miles explains to his son (Noah Jupe) in a terrific scene, the perfect lap.Additional supporting roles include Jon Bernthal as young visionary Lee Iacocca (who died earlier this year), Caitriona Balfe as Miles' supportive wife, and Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, the lead engineer on Shelby's team. Of course, Iacocca went on to become Chairman of Chrysler, where he brought in Shelby to consult on the Dodge Viper, among other models. Supposedly Le Mans racing legend and 6-time winner Jackie Ickx appears in a crowd shot, but I missed it.There is a stark contrast between the Ferrari factory and the Ford assembly line, but the egos at the top are remarkably similar. A bruised ego lit the fuse for the rivalry, but it was the car guys who made it happen. The racing scenes are adrenaline-packed and the sound in the theatre, combined with Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (SIDEWAYS, NEBRASKA) close-ups inside the car, allow us to feel the rumble and vibration and speed sensation inside the Ford GT40. Damon and Bale are terrific. Damon struts with Shelby's confidence, and Bale (after a huge weight loss from his role as Dick Cheney in VICE) captures the cantankerous genius of Miles - plus seeing his yell at other drivers during races is hilarious. There is a comical rumble between Miles and Shelby that will remind no one of Batman and Jason Bourne, but as difficult as it is to make popping a clutch exciting on the big screen, Mangold's team comes through.",8,7,15,20 November 2019
The King's Speech," A Single Shilling Bargain
","Greetings again from the darkness. British royalty is such easy pickings for film. The pomp and circumstance, colorful characters and dress, excessive everything, and especially the scandals provide an endless supply of material that can be twisted every which way. Director Tom Hooper who was responsible for fine work in the recent John Adams mini-series, takes the story of Prince Albert in a much different direction than one might think by reading history books.Collin Firth does a masterful job of portraying Prince Albert, who falls directly into the role of King after the death of his father George V (Michael Gambon) and abdication of the throne by his brother Edward (Guy Pearce) when he, for some reason, just has to marry the love of his life - a thrice divorced woman named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). Now from a perspective of scandal, Edward and Wallis aka Duke and Duchess of Windsor, would make a far more juicy movie. Heck, even the story of pending World War with Hitler's Germany would have, and often has, made for a more juicy movie. But Mr. Hooper has chosen to deliver a human drama filled with frailty, doubt, tenacity and hope. Turns out, this was a very wise choice.Prince Albert ascends the throne as King George VI, husband to Elizabeth, whom we knew as the Queen Mother until her death in 2002. The two were the parents of a daughter, who became Queen Elizabeth, the current Queen of England. Yes, we American do struggle with our Royalty and all the re-naming, yet remain fascinated by it. However, it's important to note that this was a much different time. The film leads up to King George's infamous 1939 speech in which he calmly and steadily explained to many nations that England was declaring war on Hitler's Germany.What many do not know is that George suffered a severe speech impediment that caused him to stammer excessively under pressure. As you might imagine, this is a horrible affliction for a war time King! The guts of this story is the relationship between King George and his peculiar speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). There are so many dynamics in their relationship that each scene is like a skirmish between the two. Truly a fascinating progression to behold.A deep friendship based on respect and trust develops and remains through the rest of their lives. More importantly for Britain and the world, Logue guided the King to a strong performance in the most crucial speech ... thereby bringing strength to a nation and commitment from allies. Not sure which of these men was the better leader, but together they were proved very strong.Firth, Rush, and Bonham-Carter are all excellent in their roles, and I also got a big kick out of Timothy Spall as a young Winston Churchill. Mr. Hooper does a remarkable job of creating a very human drama out of a historical period and event. The death march to the microphone is just excruciating in the climatic scene. We can feel the pain of the onlookers and supporters as the will their King to perform. I can only guess that the Queen Mother was instrumental in the development of Rolaids after so many trying moments!",8,4,7,18 December 2010
Insidious: Chapter 2," The Further
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is a perfect example of why it's acceptable for writing standards to be lowered for horror films. This isn't science fiction or history. We are in the theatre for one simple reason ... we want to be frightened (to jump in our seats). Two years after the first Insidious, director and co-writer James Wan, screenwriter Leigh Whannell and producer Oren Peli, re-team for this sequel. It's also just a few months after Mr. Wan's very successful and well-made The Conjuring.I enjoyed the first one because there was a nice story that borrowed a bit from Poltergeist and some other horror classics. In a rare treat, Wan and Whannel actually tie in the sequel to the story from the first. Sure, some of it is a stretch with all of the parallel dimensions and multiple entities, but for the most part, it works and provides some nice thrills and chills.An especially nice surprise is the creative return of Lin Shaye as Elise, who stole all her scenes in the first entry. While the voice over of her 'younger' scenes was distracting, her screen presence helps hold the final act together. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins and Barbara Hershey are back as the family Lambert ... and this time we get more backstory on why the family seems unable to escape the demons.Wan, Whannell and Peli have done a very nice job of rejuvenating the horror genre, while still including the traditional fun of active closets, abandoned hospitals, creaky doors and musty basements. A certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, but if you are looking for some scary fun, you could do much worse than the two Insidious films.",6,0,1,22 September 2013
The Lobster," Strange, Bizarre, Peculiar
","Greetings again from the darkness. The scene playing over the opening credits is baffling to us and sets the tone of peculiarity that runs throughout the film. A lady gets out of her car during a rainstorm to perform an unthinkable act as we watch through the windshield as the wipers rhythmically clear our view. Next we watch as Colin Farrell's wife announces, after 11 years of marriage, she is leaving him for another man. Curiously, Farrell asks if her new man wears glasses or contacts.Welcome to a dystopian future via the warped and creative mind of writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth, 2009). It really boils down to a satirical look at relationships and our societal outcast of single adults. In Lanthimos' world, Farrell, now a single man, must check in to the oddest country hotel you've seen. He has 45 days to find a romantic partner. If he doesn't, he will be transformed into the animal of his choice. He chooses the lobster because of its long life span  ignoring the probability of ending up on a restaurant platter.It's an oddball world overly structured with rules enforced by the Hotel manager – a terrific Olivia Colman. Farrell befriends a couple of other single fellows: the limping man (Ben Whishaw), and the man with a lisp (John C Reilly). It's funny and uncomfortable and kind of sad to watch these folks awkwardly try to connect with others with a deadline fast-approaching.The first half of the movie is really black comedy at its finest, but once Farrell escapes the Hotel and joins the 'loners' in the forest, the tone shifts a bit. An uneven romance develops between Farrell and a woman played by Rachel Weisz (who is also the film's narrator). Even though this group of loners pride themselves on independence, it's ironic that Farrell has merely traded one set of rules for another  courtesy of the rebel leader played by Lea Seydoux.It's a bizarre film, and one from which we can't look away. The deadpan-yet- emotional dialogue delivery is strange enough, but the site gags are even further off the charts – keep an eye out for animals (former singles) strolling by in the background (peacock, camel, etc). There is certainly insight into modern day relationships and how people connect based on instantaneous judgments  but at least we don't have to dig our own graves  yet!",7,3,8,12 March 2016
Moneyball," Sabermetrics in the Grand Ole Game
","Greetings again from the darkness. While reading 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' by Michael Lewis, I never once considered what it might look like as a movie. And I am the kind of guy who looks at a mailbox and wonders if a movie about a mailman might be interesting (Costner proved me wrong). If you are a baseball fan, you should see this movie. If you are not a baseball fan, the movie works very well as a metaphor for any business maverick who takes a risk and analyzes their company or industry from an entirely new perspective. The game of baseball was over a hundred years old when Oakland A's GM Billy Beane turned the institution on its ear.Mr. Lewis spent most of the 2002 season with the Oakland team and had full access to GM Billy Beane, Asst GM Paul DePodesta, and their process in putting together a team that would contend for the American League title ... all under the severe handicap of ridiculous salary constraints placed by team owners.In this movie, Brad Pitt is spot on as Billy Beane - the cocky, tobacco spitting former jock trying desperately to put his stamp on the institution of baseball. Due to some lawsuit of which I know nothing, the DePodesta role is renamed Peter Brand and is played by Jonah Hill, who looks absolutely nothing like Mr. DePodesta (who played baseball at Harvard). Despite this, Mr. Hill does an terrific job of becoming the statistical whiz who can analyze data and place value on players ... a skill he is obsessed with even 10 years later.Watching Beane trying to communicate the point of change to the old school scouts is simply priceless and painful. Years of scouting based on body type and girlfriend ranking is replaced by statistical data spit out by Brand's computer. The real fun comes when the team's field Manager, Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), flashes his bah-humbug attitude, bucks Beane's system and continues coaching old school ... from the gut. It's not until Beane takes away all other options that Howe is forced to follow the new plan.Baseball fans know that Bill James is the godfather of sabermetrics in baseball. For years his formulas and calculations were ignored by owners, managers and scouts. Thanks to the A's success, ALL teams now utilize some form of sabermetrics combined with old fashioned scouting. Every measurable event in a game is tracked and results are analyzed. Many fans say it has sucked the joy out of the game. Others say it has provided opportunities for players previously ignored. I prefer to look at it as the same in any industry ... everyone looks for a competitive advantage. Never ignore a tool or approach that can make your company more profitable or your team more competitive.Being a long time Texas Ranger fan, I must mention some of the ties to this story. The Rangers current manager, Ron Washington (portrayed by Brent Jennings), was an infield coach on those Oakland A's and gets a few scenes. Grady Fuson was the Head Scout for the A's and later came to the Rangers as co-GM or Asst GM (depending who you ask) but had a very limited stay. Mike Venafro was a relief pitcher for the A's who gets traded in 2002 so they can pick up a more valued reliever to take his spot. It should also be noted that current Rangers GM Jon Daniels and his talented staff have a place for sabermetrics and their formula has worked.The director of the movie is Bennett Miller, who was responsible for the excellent 'Capote', which also starred Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Bennett's DP here is Wally Pfister, who works frequently with the great Christopher Nolan. Pfister's camera work here is superb. The amazing writing team of Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin provide a script with sharp dialogue and just enough baseball lingo so that everyone can follow. Supporting actors include Chris Pratt (Parks & Recreation) as Scott Hatteberg, poster child for sabermetrics, Robin Wright as Beane's ex-wife, and fantastic writer/director Spike Jonze as Wright's zenned-out new husband and the polar opposite of Beane.I need to make a point about the performance of Jonah Hill. His movies 'Superbad' and 'Get Him to the Greek' are not my type of movies so I was never a big fan. That changed when I saw 'Cyrus' last year. During the Q&A after this screening, Mr. Hill pointed out that 'Cyrus' was the bridge that allowed him to be cast in this movie ... his bridge to drama. He went on to state that his acting heroes are Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray because they have had successful careers in both comedy and drama. I can honestly say that it is easy to see Jonah Hill having a Bill Murray type career, especially since he has now lost so much weight - a significant weight loss after the filming of Moneyball. He is no longer the funny fat guy. He is a talented actor.",7,20,32,14 September 2011
Whip It," Is that my Stryper T-shirt?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Disappointing, yet entertaining film version of the Shauna Cross novel brought to us by first time director Drew Barrymore. I say disappointing because it really looks like they filmed the rough draft of the screenplay. It could have been so much more with a little effort and work on the script. Entertaining for all the other reasons! First, this is Ellen Page's film ... she not only carries the Hurl Scouts into the championship game, she also carries most every scene in the film. She gets some nice support work from Alia Shawkat as her best friend Pash, as well as the lost Wilson brother, Andrew, who makes for a very interesting Roller Derby coach! Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern star as Page's mismatched parents. Harden is the one time beauty pageant queen pushing her daughter that direction, while Stern is the sports loving dad seemingly stuck with two daughters and a very controlling wife.Nice to see stuntwoman supreme Zoe Bell get another real acting gig after stealing Tarantino's Death Proof, and Juliette Lewis really chomps down on her role as the jealous oldtimer in the league. Sadly Kristen Wiig has little to do here and Jimmy Fallon is just way over the top as the ring announcer. Singer Landon Pigg has an odd turn as Page's first love interest - mostly wasted screen time that could have been better spent.Would have really enjoyed a bit more character development as there are certainly no shortage of potential jackpots. Stay for the end and check out the credits ... not sure I have ever seen more individual songs in one film.",5,11,20,11 October 2009
The Avengers," Assemble
","Greetings again from the darkness. The concern coming in was that this would be like an All-Star game, which as any sports fan will tell you, is typically a massive letdown. Assembling so many super heroes and colorful characters into one movie: Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and Loki ... would probably lead to either mass confusion, a 4 hour movie, or short straws for a couple of characters. Somehow director Joss Whedon has avoided the pitfalls and delivered a huge action film that is loads of fun for everyone, including the fanboys.Whedon does a remarkable job of giving each character their fair share of screen time, and somehow manages to make the interaction between the characters the best part of the movie. There is some terrific dialogue and the number of quick-witted exchanges are too numerous to recount. While this would be expected from Robert Downey, Jr's Iron Man, I must admit to being pleasantly surprised at Chris Hemsworth's Thor and especially Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner/Hulk. The movie contains quite a few laugh outloud moments, which is pretty impressive in a filled theatre.If you are going to combine six super heroes in a movie, you need a bad guy. A villain. Actually, a super villain. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is up to the task. For me, he was a weak link in Thor, but here is a full-fledged, powerful evil mastermind looking to gain power by stealing the Tesseract (Cosmic Cube), commanding an alien army, and ruling earth. Hiddleston is clearly having fun and it shows. For the movie to work at all, his plan and power must stand up to the impressive line up of good guys he is fighting. That is certainly the case.Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has come a long way from her brief work in Iron Man2, and we really get to know more about Natasha the Russian spy ... although her accent fades in and out. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye seems a bit out of place, but Renner is so cool, we don't really care. Chris Evans as Captain America does a wonderful job of taking control of the band of misfits and displays the leadership expected of a super-soldier. We even get a good dose of Agent Coulson (Phil to his friends) and Clark Gregg's deadpan deliver is a great addition. Samuel L Jackson (as Nick Fury) will be adding hundreds of millions more to his current record of being the highest-grossing actor of all-time.Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. Since last we saw her, she has evidently been shopping for short shorts and helping design the new Stark Tower. Natalie Portman makes a creative cameo, reprising her awful role in Thor. Stellan Skarsgard is back as a believable scientist. Powers Boothe appears as a member of the Council that Fury reports to. The great Harry Dean Stanton has a comical scene as a security guard who stumbles onto Hulk's mess. And of course, Stan Lee makes his well-deserved cameo appearance - a tradition in the Marvel movies.Much of the credit for this must go to Joss Whedon. He may finally be out of his Buffy the Vampire Slayer shadow, as this movie is quite an accomplishment. Entertaining and funny for the masses, yet detailed enough for the comic book fan boys. I was thinking how much fun this would be for a 10-12 year old, and how my mind might have exploded if something like this existed in my childhood. Even comparing this to the Christoper Reeve Superman movies will help you realize just how far super heroes movies have come.",8,2,7,5 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Say it ain't so, Joe
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ridley Scott's original film was released in 1982 and based in 2019. The highly anticipated sequel from Denis Villenueve is being released in 2017 and based in 2049. So we have 35 years between films, and 30 years between story settings. Expect that to be the most complicated part of this review since we were mandated by the studio to follow many rules – write this, don't write that. Such rules would normally be frowned upon (and even ignored by many), but in fact, this film does such a masterful job of paying homage to the first, while enhancing the characters and story, that we are eager for every viewer to experience it with fresh eyes and clear mind ... no matter how tempting it is to talk about!Obviously, the massive fan base that has grown over the years (the original was not an initial box office hit) will be filling the theatres the first weekend – even those who are ambivalent towards, or adamantly against, the idea of a sequel. The big question was whether screenwriters Hampton Fancher (maybe every writer should begin as a flamenco dancer) and Michael Green would be able to create a script that would attract new viewers while honoring the original film and source Philip K Dick novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' The answer is not only a resounding yes, but it's likely even those who usually shy away from science-fiction may find themselves thoroughly enjoying the nearly 2 hours and 43 minute run time (it doesn't seem too long).The cast is deep and perfectly matched, and there are even a few surprises (no spoilers here). Ryan Gosling is fun to watch as the reserved K, an expert Blade Runner who tracks and 'retires' old model replicants – the Nexus 8's have been replaced by the more- controllable Nexus 9's. An early sequence has K in combat mode against a protein farmer named Morton (played by the massive Dave Bautista). With all that is going on in these few scenes, director Villenueve is training us to lock in and pay attention, lest we miss the key to the rest of the movie and K's motivation for most everything he does from this point on. Robin Wright plays K's icy Lieutenant Joshi, who administers 'baseline' tests to him after every successful mission – just to make certain he is still under her control.Jared Leto delivers an understated and mesmerizing performance as the God-like Wallace who not only managed to solve global hunger, but also is a genetic engineer creating new beings. Somehow, this is one of Leto's most normal roles (which makes quite a statement about his career) and yet his character is so intriguing, it could warrant a spin-off standalone film. Wallace's trusted assistant is the ruthless bulldog mis-named Luv, played by Sylvia Hoeks. Her scene with Robin Wright is one of the best on screen female duels we've seen in awhile. One of the more unusual characters (and that's saying a lot) is Joi (Ana de Armas), the Artificial Intelligence/hologram companion to K, whose presence is cued by Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf notes. Other support work to notice comes in brief but crucial roles by Hiam Abbas, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Barkhad Abdi and Lennie James. Who is not listed above? Of course it's Harrison Ford (as seen in the trailer), who reprises his Deckard role from the original. All these years later, he's a grizzled recluse who doesn't take kindly to home visitations. Mr. Ford offers up proof that he still possesses the acting ability that made him a movie star (even if his best piloting days have passed him by). It's such a thrill to see him flash the screen presence that's been missing for many years. And yes, fans of the first film will mourn the absence of the great Rutger Hauer, yet there is no need to dwell on one of the few negatives.The story leans heavily on philosophical and metaphysical questions  just like every great sci-fi film. What makes us human, or better yet, is there a difference between humans and machines that can think and feel? Can memories be trusted, or can they be implanted or influenced over time? These are some of the post-movie discussion points, which are surely to also include the cutting edge cinematography and use of lighting from the always-great Roger Deakins, and the production design from Dennis Gassner that somehow fits the tone, mood and texture of both the first film and this sequel. The set pieces are stunning and sometimes indistinguishable from the visual effects – a rarity these days. My theatre did feature the 'shaky seats' that work in conjunction with the sound design  a gimmick I found distracting and more in line with what kids might find appealing.There was some unwelcome drama a couple of months ago as noted composer Johann Johannsson dropped out and was replaced with Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. The resulting score complements the film without mimicking the original. Ridley Scott, who directed the original BLADE RUNNER (and its numerous versions over the years), was involved as Executive Producer, and to put things in perspective, the first film was released the same year as TOOTSIE and TRON. Denis Villenueve was Oscar nominated for directing ARRIVAL, and he has proved himself to be a superb and dependable filmmaker with SICARIO, PRISONERS, and INCENDIES. He deserves recognition and respect for his nods to the original (Pan Am, Atari) and ability to mold a sequel that stands on its own  and in my opinion, is better than the first. Hopefully stating that is not against the Warner Bros rules.",8,7,21,4 October 2017
Angels & Demons," Be Gentle Inside these Walls
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ron Howard is back jabbing at the catholics with help from Dan Brown's prequel to DaVinci Code. This time it is a full out action film and Tom Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon shares some attitude with Indiana Jones! Italy in general, and Vatican City in particular, make for stunning scenery for this assault on the senses. The to-scale set of St. Peter's is marvelous, as are the not open to the public areas of catacombs and Vatican archives. Can't help but enjoy seeing the historic sites as Hanks and Ayelet Zurer (Vantage Point) race through the city trying to stop the massacre of four cardinals.Supporting work from Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl is particularly effective, though Ewen McGregor is out of place here. Mueller-Stahl's recent history of playing bad guys certainly plays right into the hands of the filmmakers. Don't miss Ron Howard's dad, Rance, as one of the Cardinals. Sadly, brother Clint makes no appearance.My preference of this story would be more intrigue and insight into the secret society of the Illuminati, and I do wish more of the Roman sites could be on display ... but this is terrific popcorn fare and will be enjoyable for most. Don't miss the amazing music playing over the closing credits.",6,1,3,17 May 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An eye for an eye
","Greetings again from the darkness.  The most descriptive word I can come up with for Vol. 2 is DELICIOUS!  Although I am a big fan of Vol. 1, this one is far superior, stands on its own, and is mad creativity onscreen.  Vol. 2 provides us with much of the background and history of our key players, including their acceptance (or not) of spirituality.  What a pleasure to see David Carradine given such a wonderful role ... an evil role that reminds of his 'kung Fu' days (with flute) - only this is Caine's gleefully monsterous twin brother!  Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah offer nice supporting work and some very welcome humor.  The fight scene with Hannah and Uma in the trailer is incredible, given the limited space with which to work.  I would like to say that this scene proved the most claustrophobic for me, but it is not even close!  Despite the wonderful cast of characters, this is Uma's film all the way.  She delivers like no other female action star ever has. Humble, personal, beautiful and vicious.  Her physicality is remarkable and enthralling to watch.  Tarantino delivers again.  His creativity and love of film is beyond question.  I take this as much more of a tribute to the old chop-socky movies than a spoof.  He is the master at interjecting humor just when the audience needs it.  The use of music is pure genius and helps create this terrific masterpiece.  Thanks QT for casting Michael Parks in 2 roles - the sheriff in Vol. 1 and the old man at the whore house in Vol. 2. Nothing to say but tremendous filmmaking and a joy to watch.",9,0,2,18 April 2004
First Man," quietly heroic
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.' Every junior high student learns that Neil Armstrong spoke those words when he became the first person to walk on the moon's surface in 1969. So while his words are etched into our minds and the televised visuals of the historic event are seared into our corneas, most of us know little of the man who is renowned as an American hero. Director Damien Chazelle (LA LA LAND, WHIPLASH) finds a way to personalize a man's story without sacrificing the corresponding grandiose theatre and immense danger. Kicking off with one of the most intense cinematic sequences ever, the film puts us inside the LLRV (Lunar Landing Research Vehicle) with Armstrong in 1961 as he bounces off the atmosphere and rockets towards near certain death. This opening makes the statement that this is no ordinary man, and this is no ordinary movie ... and we are now prepared to hold on tight! Based on James R Hansen's book, the only biography Armstrong authorized, the script from Oscar winner Josh Singer (SPOTLIGHT) expertly balances the test pilot/astronaut portion with the character study/personality of the man. Intensity is on display throughout - whether in a capsule or during family time.
Ryan Gosling stars as Neil Armstrong, and the story tracks him from 1961 through that famous moment in 1969. What we see is a man who was first an engineer, and then a pilot. A man whose intellect and nerve allowed him to be part of the second group of pilots selected for NASA's astronaut program in 1962. The first group was the Mercury Seven. He was also a man emotionally devastated by the death of his young daughter Karen (from a brain tumor) and the numerous deaths of friends and associates in the space program. The film clearly shows how he was impacted.Proving true JFK's proclamation that the driving force wasn't that it was easy, but rather that it was quite hard (and dangerous), we glimpse some of the inner workings of NASA, and what becomes clear that the space program was high stakes gambling filled with huge risks - all for a space race against the Russians that was motivated by ego and national pride. Daily danger was part of the job, as was the claustrophobia that comes with sitting in tin can space capsules being monitored by computers far less powerful than the cell phone you are likely using to read this. Armstrong's claustrophobia somehow seemed less apparent during his flights than during press conferences or sitting at the kitchen table with his family - providing even more insight into the man.Claire Foy ('The Crown') plays Janet Armstrong, the strong-for-the-kids while suffering-in- (mostly) silence homemaker wife. Ms. Foy does a nice job of conveying the emotional turmoil that goes with being an astronaut's wife, and having no one to share the uncertainty and worry with. Jason Clarke plays Ed White, the first American to walk in space (Gemini 4) and Armstrong's neighbor and close friend. Olivia Hamilton plays his wife Janet, while Kyle Chandler plays Deke Slayton, and Corey Stoll offers up a not so complimentary portrayal of Buzz Aldrin. Other familiar faces in the cast include Shea Whigham as Gus Grissom, Christopher Abbott as Dave Scott, Pablo Schreiber as Jim Lovell (played by Tom Hanks in APOLLO 13), Ethan Embry, Ciaran Hinds, Patrick Fugit, Lukas Haas, Cory Michael Smith, Brian D'Arcy James, and Leon Bridges.Meticulous attention to details of the era include kids that actually ask to go play outdoors (and aren't overly impressed with astronaut dads). The sound design and set designs are phenomenal and complement the outstanding cinematography of Linus Sandgren (Oscar winner for LA LA LAND). The abundance of close-ups allow for an intimacy that makes the awe-inspiring space sequences even more breath-taking. Actual historic space audio is used whenever possible, and director Chazelle doesn't shy away from showing us the 'other side' of the space program: Gil Scott-Heron's 'Whitey's on the Moon', writer Kurt Vonnegut publically questioning the program, and many citizens wondering why so much money is being spent on rockets while there were so many other areas (including Vietnam) in need of attention.The humor is often quite sly, including a scene where his competitive applicants shrug off Armstrong as only a 'Civilian', unaware of his remarkable service and record in the Korean War as a Navy Fighter Pilot. Gosling's quietly intense portrayal of Armstrong could be termed constrained, but it's quite fitting given his subject. Composer Justin Hurwitz (Oscar winner for LA LA LAND) delivers and unusual but fitting score, and we can't help but realize this would make a terrific trilogy bookended by THE RIGHT STUFF (1983) and APOLLO 13 (1995). Chazelle presents a fitting bio of a true American hero (and yes, we can see the flag on the moon), while also giving us a look at the harrowing process of putting folks into space. It's on us to decide if it's worth it, but leaves no doubt that President Kennedy was right ... it is hard.",8,2,7,12 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Hanging Tree
","Greetings again from the darkness. I'm now even further removed from the target demographics than for the first two Hunger Games movies. Regardless, I have read Suzanne Collins' trilogy and have now seen the 3 movies based on her books. Oh, wait. There will be FOUR movies, not three, from her source material. By definition, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is a warm-up act ... it's setting the stage for the finale which will be released in one year.So for this one we get a Hunger Games movie with no Hunger Games. In fact, there is very little combat action at all. Instead, we are witness to the strategic planning and 'selling' of a war (think Wag the Dog), replete with short promo videos featuring Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) as the Mockingjay ... the rallying symbol of the rebels. There is a terrific scene featuring four great actors: Jennifer Lawrence, Julianne Moore (as President Coin), Jeffrey Wright (as Beetee) and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Plutarch). Four great actors in harmony elevating a movie based on YA novels. Pretty cool.With no Hunger Games, the color palette of the film is almost entirely grays and browns. Even Julianne Moore's famous red tresses are toned down to a streaked gray. The bleak look reminds of the Metropolis set, and also makes President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) vivid white wardrobe and beard stand in contrast to rest. Mr. Sutherland has another juicy scene flashing his devilish grin and twinkle. He's another example of the perfect casting, which extends to Elizabeth Banks (Effie), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), Stanley Tucci, and Mahershala Ali (as Boggs). You should expect much less Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) this time, but a little more Gale (Liam Hemsworth).Jennifer Lawrence proves again that her recurring role as Katniss is underrated from an acting perspective. She is now best known as an Oscar winner, but that doesn't affect the sincerity, emotion and tenacity that she exhibits here.This ending of Part 1 feels a bit awkward, but the break comes at the right time considering how the book is written. If you are a fan of the franchise, just accept that you will be buying a ticket for this move as well as next year's finale.",6,4,20,27 November 2014
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Sappy Southern Stuff
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Missed this one at the theatre, so watched it on video.  Redford's mushy direction and Matt Damon's lack of acting ability make this nothing more than a cute, feel good movie.  Will Smith has most of the one-liners, but the real interest in the movie is from newcomer J. Michael Moncrief as the bright-eyed kid.  Gorgeous Charlize Theron is perfectly cast as the tough, stubborn, southern belle, but the script prevents this movie from taking the next step.  Also got tired of Matt Damon making the Redford poses (especially from Great Gatsby days). Note to directors of sport films: we hate poor mechanics on screen from actors playing roles of experts.  Matt Damon's swing looks like a weekend duffer.",5,1,3,1 May 2001
Black Swan," Done to Death, With Bite
","Greetings again from the darkness. Normally, I watch a movie, organize my thoughts and write my comments. Not surprisingly, this film has me all tangled up in thoughts, opinions and analysis. Though I won't, I could easily write 10 pages on this mesmerizing work from visionary director Darren Aronofsky. It's best if this film is allowed to work it's (black) magic on each individual viewer.What I can tell you is that similar to Christopher Nolan's 'Inception', there will be a definite line of demarcation between those who like and those who don't. And just like with Nolan's exceptional film, among those who 'like' this one, there will still be much debate and discussion about themes, meanings, presentation, performances and message. In my opinion, that's a pretty good report card for both films.Be forewarned ... this is a very dark, risky and edgy film. Know that it steps even farther out than Mr. Aronofsky's previous work in The Wrestler, The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream and Pi. In other words, he works very hard on the presentation so that the viewer can be whisked away in many different directions emotionally.The multi-faceted story has many angles, any of which could be construed as the lead. Natalie Portman (Nina) stars as a mid-20's member of a struggling New York ballet company. Barbara Hershey is Nina's smothering mother, who gives all dance mom's a bad name with her attempts to live vicariously through her daughter, while also stifling her growth into adulthood (the pink bedroom looks as if an 8 year old girl would be in heaven). Wynona Ryder (Beth) plays the 'aging' prima ballerina who is forced into retirement, and Mila Kundis (Lily) is the mysterious newcomer who may or may not have an agenda. The fabulous Vincent Cassel (Thomas) is the company director and plays the role full bore.Thomas announces that the company will be performing 'Swan Lake' and, almost knowing the dancers will hiss at the re-tread, he quickly adds that it's never been done his way ... the same dancer playing both the White and Black Swan. He knows that Nina is the perfect choice as the White Swan but isn't sure she can dig deep enough for the dark side. Lily is her polar opposite ... mirror image ... as the emotionally free and with a comfortable level of darkness and evil. I mention mirrors because they play a key role throughout the film.When Nina is chosen for the role, a twisted friendship with Lily emerges. This draws Nina further inside herself exposing thoughts and actions she never before imagined. On top of this, Thomas is the predatory authoritarian who constantly challenges her, leading to even more self-doubt.As Nina slowly transforms from little girl into womanhood, we witness what looks like a slow slide towards madness. Has she gone too far? Will she snap out? Much of what we see is a clash between reality and her delusional mind. The viewer must decipher where the line is ... often multiple times within a single scene! We are left wondering if Lily is stealing Nina's identity or is it the other way around? The other topic we cover is the constant battle that dancers face. The cutthroat competition, backstage battles, increasing pain and injuries, the fear of failure - both physically and emotionally, and the immense dedication and skill required for this short-lived profession. There is a drive for perfection in these dancers, just like in the best athletes, musicians, actors, etc. Of course, perfection as a goal leads to disappointment in result.I can't rave enough about the script from Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin. Breathtaking is the best word I can use to describe the camera work. We are literally onstage and whirling through the dancers. The musical score combined with the familiar songs topped with amazingly subtle (and some not so subtle) effects makes this best described as an artsy horror film meshed with a crackling psychological thriller held together by nightmarish melodrama. If that leaves you intrigued, then this one is 'perfect' for you!",9,3,13,4 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Pirate's Life for Me
","Greetings again from the darkness. I will make no apology for being a fan of the 'Pirates' series. This is the fourth film and the best since the first. Though I liked them enough, I felt the second and third depended too much on special effects and the need to overwhelm, whereas this one concentrates more on the colorful characters. This latest entry is also directed by Rob Marshall ('Chicago') rather than Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three.Of course, what really matters is that Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow. And in fine form, I might add. He comes across more clever, witty and less buffoonish than in the previous two. His character is much better as a worthy adversary than a clown prince. In this one, he alternates between matching wits and swords with no less than three characters. First, Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa. Only this time, he seems to have gone legit with the King's navy. Next we have Sparrow's long-lost love from Seville played by Penelope Cruz. They also match wits and swords (and facial hair). Lastly, we have the legendary pirate Blackbeard, played with full force by Ian McShane. Were it not a Disney movie, McShane could have made his Blackbeard one of the most frightening characters ever seen on screen. Even with the limitations, he performs exceedingly well.The 'plot' of the film involves the search for Ponce de Leon's ship and the much desired Fountain of Youth. The race is on between Sparrow, Blackbeard, the Spainiards and Barbossa who is acting on behalf of King George (a wonderful Richard Griffiths). As always, it's not always easy to tell which characters are partners and which are adversaries. That's half the fun! An interesting twist is that in order to have the desired results from the infamous fountain, one must drink from a specific chalice and include a single mermaid tear. Of course, everlasting youth shouldn't be too easy to achieve. The mermaid sequences are fascinating, though we really only get to know one of them - Syrena played with soulful eyes by Astrid Berges-Frisbey.Thankfully, two long time characters are absent from this film - Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Both were dead-weight that caused major drag in the two most recent Pirates films. Cruz and McShane are infinitely more interesting and entertaining and play off of Captain Jack much better.Speaking of Depp's Jack Sparrow, I would make the argument that this character has entered the rarefied air of film comedy icon. I would put him at or near the level of the all-time best recurring comic characters: Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers, NOT Steve Martin), Austin Powers (Mike Myers) and the Little Tramp (Charlie Chaplin). Of course, there are loads of others that have made a name for themselves but are a step below: Ernest (Jim Varney), Fletch (Chevy Chase), Wayne and Garth (Wayne's World), Riggs and Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon), etc. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.As I have stated many times, comedy is such a personal choice that it's always difficult to review. What sets the Pirate's films apart (especially one and four) are the characters combined with action and witty banter. No, it's not for everyone, but if you like this style, it's difficult to beat.",8,6,7,21 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Pictures of Matchstick Men
","Greetings again from the darkness. Uninspired sequels often prove quite annoying for a true movie fan. However, dedicated followers of a franchise often overlook the flaws and are just happy to see their familiar heroes back on screen. Back for a third time in 15 years, Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) show they can do this in their sleep ... Mr. Jones may have actually dozed off a couple of times.Fortunately there are a couple of things that make this one entertaining enough. Josh Brolin's spot on imitation of Tommy Lee Jones may be better than the real thing. Brolin seems to be enjoying himself and realizes he is the featured attraction here. There is also a very creative segment that takes place at Andy Warhol's Factory ... with Bill Hader pulling off the Warhol look and voice quite well.Obviously with the Warhol segment, time travel is involved. That's the real disappointment here. Outside of the Apollo 11 segment and listening to Status Quo play 'Pictures of Matchstick Men', the trip to 1969 is really a wasted opportunity for plot and humor. Also scarce is the use of aliens that were so prevalent in the first two. This time around, we get an overdose of Boris the Animal played by the always interesting Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords).Also back is Emma Thompson in a couple of brief scenes as Agent O. In addition to Brolin, we get new life from Alice Eve (a young Agen O) and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin ... a less annoying version of Joe Pesci from the Lethal Weapon series. Director Barry Sonnenfeld has stuck with this franchise for all three entries. Let's hope it's now allowed to rest in peace.",5,3,9,2 June 2012
Scarface," The eyes never lie
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Had not seen this since its theatrical release in 1983.  Now 20 years later, I couldn't resist the theatrical re-release. Bigger screen and better sound only enhance the experience of Pacino's most dynamic screen performance.  20 years ago I found this to be a frightening film - almost overwhelming.  The periodic laughter from the audience was the telling sign of how times have changed.  We have become numb to the violence and drug abuse.  However, PLEASE note, this is NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS.  There were at least 6 kids under 10 years old in the theatre.  Yes, times have changed, but not that much!  Michelle Pfeiffer's performance looks even better now as the lonely ice queen of the drug lords. Watching Stephen Bauer reminds me that I predicted stardoom for him 20 years ago.  Oh well, can't always be right.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is excellent and for the most part, this is DePalma's best direction.  However, in usual DePalma fashion, he goes over the top every time he wants to emphasize Pacino's anger.  The close-ups of the eyes and the increased volume would be necessary for a lessor actor, but not Pacino in his prime. Overall, the film captures the gluttony and larceny and desperation and danger of the drug underworld.  Maybe the players have changed in 20 years, but it remains a problem.  This film has turned into a very entertaining (yet violent) expose on drug traffiking.",8,0,1,21 September 2003
Frost_Nixon," No Holds Barred
","Greetings again from the darkness. Film interpretation of the play starring the same two leads, standout director Ron Howard evidently demanded Mr. Langella and Mr. Sheen be cast in their stage roles. What a simple and brilliant decision ... these two are captivating.Peter Morgan is the playwright and also wrote the screenplay, so the key players were intimately familiar and engaged in the material. Nowhere is that more evident than the ferocious performance of Frank Langella as former President Nixon. Langella's performance reminds of Forrest Whitaker as Idi Amin in 'Last King of Scotland' (not coincidentally penned by Mr. Morgan). The nuances of his performance are fascinating and can only be appreciated through multiple viewings. His gait, mannerisms, voice and expressions capture the ego, power and vulnerability of this man.Overshadowed by Langella's performance, Michael Sheen does an outstanding job as David Frost, the performer/interviewer that really just jumped into this thing for ratings. The importance of the event did not hit him until much later. Sheen is best known for his stellar work as Tony Blair in 'The Queen' (also written by Peter Morgan), but I believe this may even be better.Strong support work from the cast of Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Mattew McFayden, Toby Jones as super-agent Swifty Lazar and Rebecca Hall (most recent of 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona'). Nice to see Mr. Howard cast his brother Clint and father Rance again. Something cool about the family togetherness.While the film really makes me want to re-visit the original interviews from 1977, it makes me a bit sad that Gen X and Gen Y'ers probably don't understand the lasting impact Nixon and Watergate and the interviews have had on political reporting in general and politicians in general. Here we get a glimpse of the megalomania that goes along with a lifelong dream of becoming President of the United States. While there is certainly differences in perception of each of the men who have held office, there is unquestionably a driving force of power that motivates them. Howard and his fellow project players do a nice job of capturing that.",7,1,3,3 January 2009
Walk the Line," Steady like a Train, Sharp like a Razor
","Greetings again from the darkness. Although I am not sure Johnny Cash gets due credit for his impact in the music world, I was very pleased when I heard that this film was going to be made. Supposedly Cash and his wife, the talented June Carter, hand picked Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon to star. Whether true or a bit of legend, the two leads are nothing short of fantastic. Phoenix reminds of Gary Busey's turn as Buddy Holly more than 25 years ago.Writer/Director James Mangold ('Identity' 'Girl Interrupted') does a really nice job balancing the personal and musical development of Cash the man, with a love story for the ages between John and June. Many films struggle to have one decent story line and this one manages to do justice to two. Phoenix and Witherspoon do all their own singing and it seems as if Phoenix is gaining most of the publicity for his vocals and acting, while Witherspoon seems to be getting lost in the shuffle. This is a shame because her energy onstage and strength during other scenes are really at the heart of the movie, much as I suspect June's strength was at the heart of the real life marriage. Nevertheless, both are outstanding performances and a joy to behold. The scenes of the Folsom Prison concert are raw and heartfelt.Make no mistake, the film does show warts and all. June's (2) marriage failures, and John's marital problems and addiction to pills that nearly ruined his life and career. Watching Cash's struggle to please his father (played chillingly by 'T-2''s Robert Patrick) will make you uncomfortable, as will his scenes with first wife Vivian (played well by Ginnifer Goodwin).My only criticisms of the film stems from the fact that it really glosses over all the issues with the children and that the Sun Record tour members are generally miscast ... the exception being Waylon Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis.The supporting cast was solid overall. Country Singer Shelby Lynne has little to do as Cash's mother; in a nice touch Waylon Jennings' real life son Scooter plays him; James Keach produces and plays the Folsum warden; and Sandra Ellis Lafferty is spot on as Mother Maybelle Carter.The amazingly talented T Bone Burnett handles the music in the film and does a nice job with the selections as well as the pace. The film probably will appeal to those over 40, but younger viewers should go to get a better understanding of the roots of country, folk and rock music. At the same time, they will be treated to a very real and touching love story.",8,1,4,19 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Baywatch and Bitterness
","Greetings again from the darkness. I realize I am in the vast minority here, but I found little to laugh about in this vile, mean spirited glamorized SNL skit. Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat character is on the surface a wonderful vision, but rather than tap new comedic ground and push the political humor boundaries, it instead slams us with mean-spirited pranks and jackass style segments.Of course, I understand why Gen X and Gen Y will think it cool to jump on the bandwagon, but I see no genius or brilliance as displayed by Mel Brooks, Kevin Smith or even Jon Stewart. This one trick pony runs out of gas once he finishes his tour of his hometown.I will not be surprised if one day Mr. Cohen does in fact break new comedic boundaries, but 'Borat' will not be the project and will be soon forgotten in the world of political comedies. Just another wonderful premise gone awry, which is a shame since the great Larry Charles ('Seinfeld' 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' 'Entourage') is featured as the director. Always hate to see another Seinfeld alum fail.",2,8,17,7 November 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Careful what you Fish for
","Greetings again from the darkness. Normally if a sequel shows up a mere two years after the original, we would have good reason for low expectations. However, director Guy Ritchie is back and just as importantly, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Sticking to the successful template provided by the original, the team delivers one that is sure to keep the fans happy.The reason so many Sir Arthur Conan Doyle loyalists dismissed the first film is that the frenetic pace and towering action sequences seem to go against what made the original stories so great. So what does Mr. Ritchie do? He goes BIGGER and FASTER! There are three extended action sequences that are mind-boggling to watch. They work because the plot is so elementary, my dear. Professor Moriarty is out to cause a war from which he can personally profit. His plan involves guns, bombs and assassinations. Only our heroes can possibly stop him.Much of the odd-ball bromance from the first movie has been toned down here, and we get not only the return of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), Watson's wife (Kelly Reilly), but also the introduction of third female character - a gypsy fortune teller, Madame Simza (played by the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Noomi Rapace). Of course, McAdams character doesn't last long, Reilly gets tossed from a moving train, and Rapace is given only a few running scenes. There may be more women, but this is still a man's world.The vision for this franchise is an updated version that encourages discovery of Holmes by a new generation. And while Downey is excellent, it's difficult not to notice the similarities to Captain Jack Sparrow. Also, Professor Moriarty is very much a Bond-type villain. None of that matters too much as the rapid-fire dialogue between Holmes and Watson, and the crackling chemistry between Downey and Law, make this a fun time at a huge holiday movie.It seems odd that the release date for this one is so close to that of the new Mission:Impossible, but they both deliver what the fans want and hopefully find their audience. Even if you aren't a fan, the fabulous sets and various world filming locations will keep you interested, even as you dodge giant explosions.",7,39,78,16 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Not the Purple Pants
","Greetings again from the darkness. Kind of a return to roots for the big green guy. The action scenes are grittier, louder and bigger than in Ang Lee's version ... all with a scaled back, more believable Hulk. This time Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner and Liv Tyler is Betty Ross, his scientific partner and love interest.An unlikely casting decision puts Tim Roth as Hulk's nemesis, Blonsky, and finally as The Abomination. And a very creepy looking Willliam Hurt is the military guy attempting to cover up his mis-deeds. Somehow, Hurt's character has access to every military weapon known to man ... and the authority to use it on a college campus and in the middle of NYC. Hurt looks a bit too much like the new Burt Reynolds. I guess that adds to the list of mutants in the film.Actually, I was impressed with the action scenes ... they were what I had hoped for. Plenty of fighting and chasing and 'smashing'. The dialogue in the non-action scenes was pretty lame, but that's not really what anyone comes to see.A couple other points of interest: creator Stan Lee gets temporarily juiced off the Hulk's blood, Lou Ferrigno shows up twice - once as a pizza chomping security guard and also as the voice of Hulk, Ironman Tony Stark (Robert Downey, jr) shows up for a scene that sets the stage for 'The Avengers' and the late, great Bill Bixby (TV's Hulk) has a creative cameo via TV and 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father'. Speaking of setting the stage ... watch out for Tim Blake Nelson's character in the sequel.",7,3,5,23 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Fuhrer Museum? Nein!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Movies based on real life are often some of my favorites, but that doesn't let them off the hook in needing to be well made. The real life story of the Monuments Men provides both pride and heartbreak. This Allied group tracked down and rescued so much Nazi-stolen artwork, while at the same time being so short-staffed that they resorted to picking and choosing what parts of history and culture to save.For much of 2013, this movie was mentioned as a possible Oscar contender. When the release date was delayed and Clooney admitted he was struggling with the film's tone - a balance of comedic and dramatic and historic elements - all the warning flags shot up. The final version would certainly have benefited from script improvement, though the cast is so strong and the mission so true, that the film is still enjoyable enough. Director George Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov have adapted the source material from Robert M Edsel, but Clooney can't resist stamping the movie with his smirk appeal.The actual Monument Men spend very little time together, so it's tough to call this an ensemble piece. Bill Murray and Bob Balaban have their own subtle comedy routine going, while John Goodman and Jean Dujardin enjoy a jeep ride. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett add a dose of gratuitous love interest where it's not needed, and Hugh Bonneville strikes the heroic pose of redemption. Director Clooney ensures that actor Clooney and his buddy Damon get the most screen time and close-ups, detracting from what the real story should be ... the men who saved art and culture.Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges and Hubert van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece are supposedly the centerpieces of this group's mission, but the film really is just an amalgam of individual scenes that leave the viewer working frantically to tie all the pieces together. Shouldn't that be the filmmaker's job? The question gets asked a couple of times, 'Is art worth a human life?'. That critical theme could have been the core of a far superior movie ... one not in desperate need of suspense rather than more punchlines.Very few war projects have successfully blended comedy and drama. A few that come to mind are Kelly's Heroes, The Dirty Dozen and TV's 'Hogan's Heroes'. It's a tricky line to walk, even with a great cast. So while this one has sufficient entertainment value for a February release, I would rather recommend two others that deal with this same subject matter: The Rape of Europa (2007, documentary) and The Train (1964, directed by John Frankenheimer, starring Burt Lancaster).",4,3,5,11 February 2014
Miracle," We hit a moose
","Greetings again from the darkness.  So many sports movies fail because the sport action is unrealistic or is simply a series of close-ups.  'Miracle' works on so many levels, but the biggest surprise is the quality of the hockey action.  Many real hockey players were used in order to maintain the realism of the practices and games, and the young men are also wonderfully effective as characters within the film.  The key roles of Eruzione and Craig were perfectly captured and I dare you to guess which has an acting background!  Remarkably, this film works also from a historical basis and as a personal interest story AND, maybe most effectively, as a biographical sketch of the late Herb Brooks.  I have been a Kurt Russell fan for years, but have always ripped him for his selection of roles.  With a few exceptions ('Backdraft' 'Tombstone' are a couple) his choices have prevented him from reaching the same level as a Mel Gibson.  Somehow even Kevin Costner has had had greater box office success.  What a joke.  Russell appeals to men and women, is very charismatic on screen and is more athletic than most movie stars.  Too bad he hasn't had better judgement all these years.  The good news is, Russell BECOMES Herb Brooks in 'Miracle'.  I forgot it was Russell and watched as if this was all happening for the first time!  I do hope a year from now, he is remembered for an Oscar nomination. When you see this, please note what a terrific actress Patricia Clarkson is ('The Station Agent' 'Pieces of April')  She is so subtle in her mannerisms, yet so expressive.  Just a joy to watch.  So go see this one a couple of times ... it will leave you filled with emotion as you catch a glimpse of one of the biggest moments in U.S. history.  If you think that is an overstatement, you are too young to remember!",8,1,2,8 February 2004
Mission: Impossible III," A Trilogy ... hopefully
","Greetings again from the darkness. The biggest star, the best actor, a cool theme song, great cast, hot director, high tech gadgets, a $300,000 Lamborghini and some great shots of Rome and Shanghai. All of this should lead to a killer action thriller. Instead we get little more than a two hour TV episode. The dialogue and story are elementary at best.Super freak Tom Cruise reprises his Ethan Hunt role in what we can only hope will be the final installment in the MI series. Cruise, of course, puts on his best Tom Cruise impersonation as he struts, sprints, scowls, stares and smiles through the whole film.The Cruise circus is not the surprise. What is surprising, and near criminal, is the total wasting of the sterling cast. Ving Rhames has a couple of one-liners, Lawrence Fishburne is in a couple of scenes, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are just eye candy. The rarely seen Billy Crudup (in awful pink lipgloss) is just plain awful as he bows down to Cruise in their shared scenes. Up and coming megastar Michelle Monaghan gets to do little more than smile, cry and smooch on Cruise. The biggest waste of all is the use of Philip Seymour Hoffman who flashes his brilliance in his too few scenes as evil incarnate. This had the chance to be one of the all time great film baddies, but the part is so short and poorly written that even the magnificence of Hoffman can't quite get it there.Turning this over to TV boy wonder ('Lost') JJ Abrams may have been the biggest mistake. He was obviously not ready for this project. It disappoints throughout and Abrams does not have the chops (of DePalma in the first one) to improve the script and provide some flow to a weak story. His direction is muddled and sloppy and even out of focus at times. The big scene on the bridge with the drone and helicopter is just a mess. And what is with the lack of use for the classic theme song? Such a disappointment!",5,5,10,5 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Kansas City Shuffle
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'Pulp Fiction', 'Snatch', 'The Usual Suspects', 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Four of those movies were my favorite of their year and they are all movies that 'Slevin' is being compared to. Sorry to say, but it is nowhere near that level and, at times, it is downright annoying how hard it tries to be clever. If you are paying attention at all, the mystery of the film is over within the first 10 minutes. At that point the only fun lies in putting the pieces together.A tremendous cast of veterans such as Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis and Sir Ben Kingsley do an admirable job of creating the underworld tension necessary for the story. Lucy Liu plays, for the first time, an appealing character who actually laughs, smiles and speaks coherently. Josh Hartnett is well cast as the supposed down on his luck, you got the wrong guy, placed in a no win situation. The problem lies with Hartnett's (Slevin's) dialogue. No one in his situation would wise crack like this. The Boss (Freeman) and The Rabbi (Kingsley) call him on it, but never take the next step. This was the biggest obstacle I couldn't overcome. If this guy can't fool me, how does he fool mob kingpins? This movie tries so hard to be in the class of the aforementioned, but that makes Hartnett's lines even more painful to listen to. On the plus side, the set decoration is outstanding. It is a cross between 'Laugh-in' and 'The Brady Bunch'. The wallpaper looks like something from a mid-60's Peter Sellers comedy.It does have some fun moments, including the scenes with Freeman and Willis, plus Kingsley realizing at the end what all has occurred right before his eyes. Overall, it appears many are overrating the film, just because it wants to be better than it really is.",6,5,14,8 April 2006
Captain Phillips," Fighting Irish
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Paul Greengrass seems to thrive on finding the line for unbearable tension and hectic, claustrophobic action. He gained fame for helming The Bourne Supremacy and The Borne Ultimatum, but this one has more in common with his excellent United 93. Somehow he keeps us gripping the armrests despite knowing full well how the story ends. That is a talented filmmaker.What adds to the stressed-filled fun here is that the world's greatest everyman, Tom Hanks, meets his match with fire-eyed Somalian pirate Muse, played by first time actor Barkhad Abdi. The scenes pitting these two against each other are fascinating studies and the perfect example of vastly different worlds colliding. Hanks plays Captain Phillips, who is charged with guiding the cargo ship Maersk Alabama through the pirate filled waters. Phillips is not the warmest of guys, but seems to be a competent captain with respect from the crew.Most of us remember watching on TV in 2009 as the 5 day sequence ended thanks to yet another perfectly executed Navy SEALs rescue mission. Greengrass does a terrific job of reenacting this moment. The other two moments that are sure to leave an impression both involve Mr. Hanks. The initial scene on the bridge as the pirates assume control of the ship ... when Muse tells Phillips that he is now the captain, we see a flash of surrender in Phillips' face. A stunning scene for both Hanks and Abdi (and congrats to Abdi for going toe to toe with the acting legend). The other scene worthy of discussion occurs after the rescue as Captain Phillips is escorted to sick bay to be checked out. His 'in shock' actions are startling and very brave for an actor. Some may argue that Hanks took it too far, but I would encourage you to put yourself in that lifeboat and determine just how courageous you would be. Abdi also has a scene where he first discovers this is an American ship. He reacts as if he has won the lottery.Some scandal surrounds this story as there is a lawsuit against Maersk and Phillips brought by members of the crew. The contention being that Phillips knowingly steered the ship too close to the pirate waters in order to save time and money. Phillips went on to write a best selling book recounting the ordeal and he also returned to his job as ship captain. Hanks was the perfect choice to play Phillips as the story is more about a regular guy being thrust into an extraordinary situation. Phillips is no superhero ... he doesn't disarm four pirates. Instead, he uses guts and a will to live ... things we all hope we would exhibit should we ever find ourselves in such an awful situation.",7,1,7,12 October 2013
Sucker Punch," Oh, and one more thing ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. I am actually a fan of Zack Snyder's two most recent films: 300 and Watchmen. Because of those films, I was really looking forward to what he would do with his first original piece. Two things are now very clear. First, Mr. Snyder is a visual virtuoso with film. Secondly, he is not much of a writer.I'll start with the bad news. I was stunned at how lousy the story and script were. Some of the dialogue is so bad it comes across as purposefully dumbed down. If that is the intention, then I must ask WHY? It's clearly not a movie for little kids, so most over aged 13 are quite capable of following a story. Therein lies the biggest problem. This isn't even a story! The ending makes absolutely no sense and the road to that ending just makes you happy it's over ... no matter the dumb ending.The good news is that Mr. Snyder's visual effects do not disappoint. There are some terrific battle scenes and one of the coolest on screen dragons you'll ever see. The film is very dark and muted in colors (think Sin City) but that works for the dream sequences and the asylum interiors. Very little color is present other than just before the dance sequences. Speaking of, what's with the dance sequences? If Baby Doll's dancing is the key to the film, shouldn't we get more than just a head-bob? The premise is that Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is cast away to an asylum by her step-father. She has five days to escape or she faces a lobotomy. Yes, really. She quickly discovers that her dancing has a mesmerizing effect on all those watching and she can escape into her fantasy world. While there, she meets a Wise Man played by Scott Glenn in a role that would have been perfect for the late David Carradine. The Wise Man tells her what to do to gain her freedom and she quickly enlists the help of some other inmates: Sweat Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens)and Amber (Jamie Chung).The asylum has an even darker side as run by Blue (Oscar Isaac). He forces Dr Vera Gorski (Carla Gugin) to teach the girls to dance so as to entertain 'high rollers' who pay big bucks to Blue to spend time with the girls. Gugino plays her character like a rip-off of Natasha Fatale from the old Bullwinkle cartoons. Blue is just a weaselly bad guy who brings nothing to the film ... and this film needed a top notch bad guy.The actresses all seem like they got into their roles and enjoy the physicality required for the fighting and action scenes. Cornish especially comes off well. Browning in the lead as Baby Doll brings no real baggage to the role as most won't recognize her. Jena Malone has been an indie film favorite for years and Ms. Hudgens is trying to find a new audience after the High School musical films.This movie was pitched as 'Alice in Wonderland with machine guns'. I believe that is a slap to the face of Lewis Carroll. Watching this movie is like watching someone else play a video game that you aren't familiar with ... or a two hour music video of a terrible song. So if you must see it, enjoy the visual effects and don't think too much about what the characters say or why they do what they do. And let's all hope that Mr. Snyder's visuals payoff for next year's Superman movie ... and be glad that Christopher Nolan is working on that script!",4,11,26,29 March 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," We are infinite
","Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating Q&A with writer/director Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a well-made film can be. A well written script is so refreshing, and an exceptional script can be truly breath-taking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel (a 1999 bestseller), and he left me stunned and enthralled.The popularity of the novel would typically make the film version a disappointment for its fans. Not so this time. Mr. Chbosky remains true to the spirit despite the need to edit for the sake of continuity and brevity. The key characters spring to life thanks to the efforts of four strong performances from young actors: Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson, The Three Muskateers) plays Charlie, Emma Watson (Harry Potter films) is Sam, Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin, City Island) is Patrick, and Mae Whitman (Arrested Development) is Mary Elizabeth.If you have read the book, you know the story ... you know the characters ... you know the themes. If you haven't read the book, I will spoil nothing. The brilliance is recognized only as you get to know these characters and slowly uncover their stories. What we discover is that, regardless of our age, we recognize these characters from our high school days. We know the introverted, observant Charlie who so desperately needs a support system. We surely recognize the attention-starved, lacking in self-esteem Sam who is the epitome of 'We accept the love we think we deserve'. And we all knew a Patrick ... the flamboyant one who sheaths his pain with an over-the-top act of public confidence. What Chbosky does is shine the spotlight on these characters to ensure that we really SEE them this time.The themes reminded me a bit of a darker John Hughes film (that's a compliment). There were also pieces of two other really good films: Stand By Me and Almost Famous. The formative years of a writer determine the depths to which his or her work will reach later in life. Admittedly, the film is substantially autobiographical, so when Mr. Chbosky says it's a personal story, we begin to understand the foundation of his remarkable writing style.'Welcome to the island of misfit toys.' When this line is spoken, we realize that most every high school kid has thought the same thing at some point. These are painful and difficult times and as Mr. Chbosky stated, we should encourage kids to fight through this stage and get on to the next ... then able to find their true self. Clearly, the film made a strong impact on me. My favorite reaction to a movie is profound thought, and this one caused this in waves. The decision to release as PG-13 was wise. There is no excess of profanity or nudity to divert attention from what really matters ... the characters. I can think of no finer compliment to a writer and filmmaker than to cite them as the cause of my internal discussions related to their film. My hope is that you have the same reaction.

The Finest Hours," real life Disney heroes
","Greetings again from the darkness. The U.S. Coast Guard has played a role in many movies over the years, but only a few have placed this service branch directly in the heart of the story  most recently The Guardian (2006), which was little more than a cheesy, too-talkative water-based rip-off of Top Gun. Director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl, 2007) takes a much different approach as he presents a look at one of the most legendary and heroic real-life rescues in Coast Guard history.The Oscar-nominated writing team behind The Fighter (2010): Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson have collaborated on the screenplay based on the book from Casey Sherman and Michael J Touglas. It's a worthy tribute (and clearly Disney-influenced) to what is described as the greatest Coast Guard small-boat rescue. It combines a boat-load (sorry) of tension-filled ocean-based sequences with some pretty interesting character-based sub-plots within a Massachusetts community that has become all too familiar with storm-based catastrophes.Chris Pine stars as Bernie Webber, an awkwardly shy and obsessive rule-follower, who has lived under a cloud of doubt ever since a previous rescue mission failed, resulting in the death of a local fisherman/husband/father. We first meet Bernie as he bungles through a first date with Miriam (Holliday Grainger, a young Gretchen Mol lookalike). The film then jumps ahead to 1952 when they become engaged and Bernie is ordered into a questionable mission by his 'not-from-around-here' commanding officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana). See, a huge storm has literally ripped apart not one, but two giant tankers, leaving crew members battling for survival. It should be noted that Bana the Australian, tosses out a laughable southern accent that is a joke within the movie and within the theatre (for different reasons).Bernie and his crew: Richard Livesay (Ben Foster), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner), and Ervin Maske (John Magaro), take off against all odds in a too-small boat against too-big waves in a desperate attempt to rescue the tanker crew that includes brilliant engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) and characters played by John Ortiz and Graham McTavish. Affleck excels as what can be termed a quiet leader. Of course, we know how the story ends, but the heroic efforts against a very powerful Mother Nature show-of-force make for compelling movie watching.The special effects are stout, though not be as spectacular as The Perfect Storm (2010) or In the Heart of the Sea (2015), and it's the human-factor that provides more than enough thrills, excitement, and tension. In fact, the biggest issue I had was that I saw a 3-D version which is an absolute disservice to the film. Most of the story takes place at night and at sea, so the 3-D consequence of dimmed light and muted colors results in a far too dark and dull look to the film. I spent much of the movie sliding the 3-D glasses down my nose in a simple attempt to enjoy a bit more brightness. The recommendation would be to skip the higher-priced (money grabbing) 3-D version and take in the more pleasing 'standard' version.Disney makes feel-good movies. Their target market is not cynics or the overly critical among us. The romance pushes the 'corny' meter, but keeps with tradition of other Disney movies based on true stories like The Rookie (2002) and Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story (2005). Keep this in mind you'll likely find this one pretty entertaining. Stick around for the closing credits as a slew of real photographs from the actual 1952 event are displayed, as are photos of the real heroes from that night.",6,49,77,28 January 2016
3:10 to Yuma," They Were Shooting Bullets
","Greetings again from the darkness. (Sept 3, 2007) Remakes always cause me to pause, especially when they are of films I enjoyed ... such as the 1957 '3:10 to Yuma', which was probably Glenn Ford's best screen performance. Still, having only seen the preview twice (remarkable in this day), I was instantaneously curious to see Batman and Gladiator in the lead roles!! This is a fantastic traditional western film with good guys and bad guys and muddled minds, when the time comes to decide what is morally right and what might actually be an easy way out. As we have seen in 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'High Noon', choosing the easy way out is rarely heroic and certainly doesn't create the high intensity story line played out in '3:10 to Yuma'. The old west is the perfect playground for writers who enjoy showing the complexity involved in manhood, especially when fatherhood is involved.The two leads are exceptional. Russell Crowe exudes badness and coolness and brilliance as the legendary outlaw, Ben Wade. Watching his psychological games with his captors is creepy, yet humorous and at times, downright frightening. Good guy Christian Bale captures the desperation of a man continually wronged by his country, politicians, and even his God. He struggles to maintain his character for his sons and wife, but this is no ordinary man. He is possessed by character.Supporting standouts include Ben Foster as Crowe's right-hand man, Charlie Prince. Think Michael Biehn in 'Tombstone'. Foster is a scary guy, but also has a couple of the film's funniest lines. Gretchen Mol plays Bale's wife, and though she is given little to do, I must ask again ... 'Why doesn't this woman work more often?'. She is excellent in every role she takes, but she needs more screen time. If you doubt Ms. Mol's talent, please see 'The Notorious Bettie Page'. Also of note is Alan Tudyk who plays Doc. Tudyk gives another fine performance on the heels of his zany role in the excellent 'Death at a Funeral'. Also, I would be remiss to not mention Peter Fonda's all too brief role as the bounty hunter. Fonda spews his lines at the camera.What makes this updated version slightly better than the original is the gritty, dusty approach taken by up ('Walk the Line') and down ('Kate and Leopold') director James Mangold. We FEEL the gunshots, stampedes, chase scenes and dirt in the wounds. This realism helps build the tension of the final few minutes. Also, a tip of the hat to Mangold for not beating us over the head with shots of watches and clocks. There are enough for effect, but no so many as to ruin the moment.This is a must see and probably one of the best of the year. Can't often say that about August/September releases, but I assume it was released so as to not conflict with the upcoming Crowe/Denzel Washington film. Regardless, this is a film to see.",8,0,1,26 October 2010
The Equalizer," The Fish gotta be the Fish
","Greetings again from the darkness. While you are likely familiar with slapstick comedy, this latest from director Antoine Fuqua could be described as slapstick action. This fits because the implements of destruction include barbed wire, a power drill, a book (hardcover, of course), a nail gun, and even a corkscrew. Such an unusual assortment takes a bit of edge off the the extremely graphic violence. If the kills weren't so gruesome, we might be tempted to chuckle.Writer Richard Wenk adapts the story from the terrific TV series which ran from 1985-89. It starred the late, great Edward Woodward as a classy, sophisticated guy who believed in justice for those who needed help against the odds. For the movie, Denzel Washington takes over for Mr. Woodward as Robert 'Bob' McCall ... the seemingly normal guy with extraordinary skills used to balance the scales.McCall lives a quiet life with OCD tendencies. He is a friendly guy liked by his co-workers at the home improvement box store (imagine Clark Kent working at Home Depot), and even mentors an overweight hispanic young man in his quest to pass the security guard test. McCall is also an insomniac who hangs out after hours reading Hemingway at a local diner, passing along words of hope and wisdom to an underage prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz). None of these people have any idea of McCall's previous career with 'the company'. Our only glimpse of this is a quick visit to the home of characters from his past, played by Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman.Our villains here are the Russian mob, and it's tough to beat that accent for a juicy villain. David Meunier (Johnny Crowder of 'Justified' fame) is our first goon, followed up by the slick and menacing Marton Csokas (The Debt) who has an impressive resume of his own. It would have been interesting to have more screen time together for Csokas and Denzel, but we understand why that's not practical.Similar to the Bourne movies, the good guy always seems to be a step ahead of the bad, but that has little impact on our ability to find fun in the action. Director Fuqua provides four or five really stylistic shots (including super slo-mo), but also relies on Michael Bay-splosions for one laughable scene at the loading docks. Another missed opportunity is the score. We are slammed with a thumping bass line through much of the movie, rather than utilizing the Stuart Copeland theme from the TV series. Expect McCall to arrange the flatware just so, and continue to dish out justice in at least one sequel.",6,2,7,28 September 2014
The Expendables 2," Rip it Up
","Greetings again from the darkness. As we get older, we expect to learn from our experiences. That's exactly what happened here. It's been almost two years to the day since The Expendables hit theatres. That first entry was directed, produced, written by, and starred Sylvester Stallone. This time around Sly sticks to acting and a script credit. Con Air director Simon West is now at the helm and the film clearly benefits from better action, improved characters and especially MUCH more humor ... the key reason it works.Most of the familiar faces are back. Stallone as Barney, the leader of this pack of mercenaries; Jason Statham as Christmas; Dolph Lundgren as Gunner; Terry Crews as Hale Caesar; Randy Couture as Toll Road; and Jet Li as Yin Yang, though he is unfortunately only in the pre-opening credits sequence. Also back, after brief but funny cameos in the first, are Bruce Willis as Church, and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench. If somehow that's not enough testosterone for you, the second installment also provides Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Villain (pronounced vi-LANE, get it?), martial arts expert Scott Adkins, and 72 year old Chuck Norris as Booker ... the 'Lone Wolf' soldier.For sake of balance, the female lead is played by Nan Yu as Maggie. She is a brilliant fighter, speaks multiple languages, yet dumb enough to fall for Barney (guessing that was Stallone's contribution to the script). While the story is necessarily simple, her role is vital in that she softens some scenes, while at the same time holding her own with the sea of steroid and botox stars.This version is extremely likable and filled with tongue-in-cheek humor, sarcasm and wit. The guys are not hesitant about poking fun at themselves or each other ... all the while surrounded by nearly non-stop action, gun play, missile firing and other forms of over-the-top violence and action. In other words, it's exactly what we hoped it would be! (www.moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com)",7,4,11,18 August 2012
Source Code," I'll Never Forget Our 8 Minutes
","Greetings again from the darkness. Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie) was the writer/director for a terrific 2009 film called 'Moon' (highly recommended). Here he stays in the sci-fi realm with a thrilling and brainy script from Ben Ripley. The best, most accessible sci-fi films not only don't require the viewer to hold a Ph.d, but they also don't talk down to us. This is a fast-moving script with a smart (though a bit preposterous) premise, and plenty of reality to keep us glued to the screen ... and hanging on every word spoken.It's impossible to write much about the film and not give away some of the stuff that makes it fun, so I will be very brief. Trying to figure out what's happening, how it's happening, and whether they can stop it from happening again ... well, that's just about all a movie lover can hope for! So I won't give away any more than what the trailer sets up.Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens and he is involved in a remarkable project that allows 'time travel' to a parallel universe so that a military contractor can discover the terrorist who bombed a train. The first time he wakes up on the train across from Christina (Michelle Monaghan) he has no idea who she is or where he is. 8 minutes later he is face to face with Captain Goodwin's face (Vera Farmiga) on a monitor and her voice telling him to calm down. Her boss (Jeffrey Wright) is some type of ambitious genius trying to make a name and a buck for himself.The story evolves by Gyllenhaal being sent back and forth between 'then and now' on numerous occasions with the mission of uncovering the identity of the bomber. Of course, Gyllenhaal is a good soldier and wants to go above and beyond the call of duty. That's where the film gets tricky and brilliant.Director Jones works wonders with the camera and we are treated to some fascinating images - both large (Chicago) and small (Gyllenhaal in a train restroom). Great stuff here. That's about all I will say on this one. It should be obvious how much I like it. Also, a fun note ... the phone voice of Gyllenhall's father is that of Scott Bakula, who is known for his role in the TV series 'Quantum Leap', also a time travel premise.",8,1,5,2 April 2011
Skyfall," And This Time it's Personal
","Greetings again from the darkness. Celebrating 50 years on film for Ian Fleming's creation, we get the 23rd official James Bond movie. Many critics are hailing it as the best one yet, though having seen all in the series, it is difficult to understand a proper form of comparison. The Connery run varies significantly from the Roger Moore period, and though Pierce Brosnan brought a touch of seriousness back to the role, it wasn't until Daniel Craig that the character and series took on an ultra-intense structure. Clear influences are seen in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, as well as the Bourne series.This latest entry has some distinct advantages. Most importantly, Sam Mendes in the director's chair brings a love and understanding of the Bond template, but the skills to deliver both top notch action sequences as well as realistic human drama. His background includes such fine films as American Beauty and Road To Perdition. Mendes brought on famed Director of Photography Roger Deakins (9 Oscar nominations) who delivers a look and feel superior to any previous Bond film. Also, the villain plays a key role in determining the strength of all Bond films. Here, Javier Bardem offers up a megalomaniac bent on revenge, and his unusual approach immediately vaults his Silva into one of the top 5 all time Bond villains.Of course, none of that matters without a strong Bond, and it is quite clear that Daniel Craig has made the role his own. This particular script from series vets Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan demands some real acting as Bond faces his mortality as well as his childhood roots. These issues combined with the physical demands of the action and the ability to toss in a few zingers, make Mr. Craig a nice fit for the tailored suits ... and the classic Aston Martin.It wouldn't be Bond without the Bond 'women', and while there isn't much familiarity of Berenice Marlohe, her Severine is interesting enough to capture our attention ... even with Komodo Dragons hovering nearby. We also get Naomie Harris as Field Agent Eve, and the argument can be made that she is weakest link in the film. Surprisingly, the real Bond woman this time is M, played once again by the great Judi Dench. Much of the story revolves around her and there is quite a bit of ageism involved. Experience does matter ... unless you are speaking of the new Q. Played with fascinating geekery by Ben Whishaw, the museum scene with Q and Bond is one for the ages.The usual global jet-setting is on full display with Istanbul, London, Macau, Shanghai and the Scottish Highlands. The traditional opening action sequence finds Bond racing across Turkish rooftops on a motorcycle, while wearing a beautifully tailored suit. These are the same rooftops on display in Taken 2, but it's much more fun here. Then, as if motorcycles on the roof and through the Grand Bazaar of Turkey aren't enough, we find Bond fighting atop a fast moving train ... well, until M makes a business decision that quickly changes the arc of the story.When Bond finally meets Silva (Bardem), it is on the deserted Hashima Island. We quickly learn that Silva is no ordinary criminal and definitely not one to just sit and chat. His quest for revenge adds a personal touch. His personality and demeanor and background add elements previously missing from Bond films. It's no surprise that the film's best sequence involves Bond and Silva together and the tradition of the villain explaining what's ruffled his feathers.The climax of the film occurs on the hardscape of Scotland and forces Bond to come to terms with his past. There are also plenty of parental issues thanks to M and the caretaker played by Albert Finney. The personal forces at work in the script are more developed than in other Bond films, but we definitely don't get cheated on explosions, gun play and hand to hand combat.As always, music plays a vital role. Adele sings the opening title track and it plays over an unusual opening credits graphical sequence - somewhat bleaker than we are accustomed to, but no less dramatic. Also, Thomas Newman's score is excellent and incorporates Monty Norman's iconic Bond themes (though not often enough for my tastes).This latest Bond film is a fine bounce back after the disappointing Quantum of Solace, and it may be the best made of all films. The idea of cyber-terrorism is very timely and a reminder that not all bad guys are trying to take over the world. Some just need revenge. Determining if it is the 'best' Bond ever will be your call.",8,1,7,11 November 2012
The Young Victoria," Victorian Rebel without a Cause, but a Crown
","Greetings again from the darkness. Emily Blunt would have stolen The Devil Wears Prada if not for the queen of screen, Meryl Streep. Here she competes with no one and does a nice job of carrying the film based on the early years of Queen Victoria. If you are rusty on your British sovereign history, she ruled from 1837-1901.For 20 of these years, she was married to her true love, Prince Albert (played well by Rupert Friend). While the two meet as youngsters, the bond between them comes from their letters ... an early precursor to eHarmony?? We know Victoria mostly from royal portraits, so it's nice to see her as a rebellious youngster trying to learn the tricks of the trade, even while being manipulated like a pawn by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and her lover (Mark Strong). We get to see her tenacity blossom as she matures and literally grows into the monarchy.While Ms. Blunt's performance is strong, Julian Fellowes' writing is not at the level of his previous work in Gosford Park. We do get some of the same power plays, but it is missing the nuances of that much better film.",6,20,24,8 February 2010
Catch Me If You Can," Dragnet meets The Fugitive
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Spielberg delivers a very entertaining romp through the life of Frank Abagnale,jr.  I have not read the book yet, so am a little unsure what is fact and what is Hollywood, but it did seem strange that he was captured 3 times.  Interesting performance by a New England accented Tom Hanks, who seems to be giving us his best Jack Webb impersonation.  Leo is solid as the con on the run and was a nice selection with his natural charm.  However, nowhere near as dynamic a performance as he gives in 'Gangs of New York'.  Stealing every scene was Christopher Walken.  Known mostly over the last 20 years for his goofing as frequent host of Saturday Night Live, Walken reminds of why he was thought to be a real up and comer in 'The Deer Hunter'.  I got chills as Walken swells with pride in his son as he realizes Frank has the establishment on the run. Really thought many of the scenes with his fiance and her family were idealized and were there to show how Frank missed being part of a family unit.  Again, I don't know the facts of the case, this is just a perception. Spielberg gets some nice supporting performances out of Mr. Barbra Streisand (James Brolin), Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner.  Mostly this is an entertaining film that the masses will enjoy and there is nothing wrong with that.",7,0,1,2 January 2003
The Hangover," Vegas, Baby, Vegas
","Greetings again from the darkness. Old School director Todd Phillips takes us to Vegas. Justin Bartha (National Treasure) is getting married in a couple of days and his friends Ed Helms (The Office) and Bradley Cooper (Wedding Crashers) decide a road trip bachelor party to sin city is a good call. Justin's off kilter, soon to be brother in law, the incredible Zach Galifianakis, joins them as well.The next morning the three of them wake up in a trashed hotel suite with a chicken, tiger and no sign of Justin. Comedy ensues as they try to re-create the events of the previous evening through various clues ... such as a stolen police car being brought up from valet.Ed Helms is very good, but much of the comedy comes from Zach G. He has a bit of early John Belushi to him, thanks to the heft and delivery. More importantly, he is not predictable in the least.Mike Tyson, who shows up for his tiger, adds quite the offbeat element, especially while singing Phil Collins ... wow. Rachael Harris is perfect as the bossy girlfriend to Helms and their showdown near the end is a winning moment. Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong and Heather Graham all have their moments, but unlike the previews, I won't give anything else away.If you like Old School, this comedy is in your wheelhouse.",7,2,5,14 June 2009
Iron Man 3," The Prodigal Returns
","Greetings again from the darkness. My initial reaction upon seeing this opening day was that some fan boys are not going to be happy. Of course, this happens every time Hollywood makes changes to the original comic book material in hopes of attracting massive box office numbers. While I recognize many of the 'flaws', I found this to be an interesting turn on the Tony Stark/Iron Man series.Shane Black was brought in to direct and help write the script. Mr. Black is best known for his crackling buddy dialogue in movies like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (also with Robert Downey Jr), but doesn't have significant directorial experience (his most recent effort was KKBB 5 years ago). My belief has always been that what sets this franchise apart is Robert Downey Jr's take on Tony Stark. A wise-cracking billionaire playboy technology and mechanical genius searching for his true identity. Mr. Black re-focuses the story on Stark. In fact, he basically takes everything away and has him start over.Regardless of the story, many line up for these movies to see the special effects and the bad guys. The special effects are everywhere ... and loud ... and massive. The trailer shows a clip of Stark's Malibu mansion being destroyed, but the entire segment is quite impressive. The number of Iron Man suits seems unlimited at times and the big finale gave me the same feeling of a 4th of July fireworks display when it ends with so many clumps of fireworks being fired at once, that the impact is dulled. As for the bad guys, The Mandarin is one of the most fierce opponents faced by Iron Man in the comics. His portrayal here by Ben Kingsley is a blast to watch, but will undoubtedly upset the true fanboys. Guy Pearce plays Aldrich Killian, a demented mastermind, once snubbed by Stark - in a scene we witness in flashback.My preference here is to focus on the fun elements since that's clearly what Marvel and Black are shooting for. Jon Favreau directed the first two entries in the franchise and here takes on a slightly bigger role as head of security for the Stark corporation ... and he provides some comic relief. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) finally gets to do more than roll her eyes, but she still has her damsel in distress moments. Don Cheadle returns as Col. Rhodes ... or War Machine ... now known as Iron Patriot, but mostly he is just waiting for his own movie. Rebecca Hall has some screen time as a smart woman who is not so wise in her choosing of partners. No comment. Ty Simpkins plays Harley, a country boy who helps Stark in his time of need. James Badge Dale, Miguel Ferrer, William Sadler, and Dale Dickey all have strong moments, but therein lies what may be the film's biggest weakness.It's an incredibly impressive film to watch ... giant visuals, really good actors and quick, witty dialogue. But there seems to be an overload of each of these things. Guy Pearce's character is woefully underdeveloped. I so wanted more of his backstory and motivation. Same with Harley, the boy. Much could have been done with that. Miguel Ferrer, always a worthy opponent, must have had his best scenes left in editing. The scene with Ben Kingsley, Don Cheadle and Robert Downey Jr, may have been the best in the movie simply because we got a real peak at each of these character's personality. That's way more fun that another explosion! The film pummels us with action, probably has too much Tony Stark and too little Iron Man for the fanboys, throws in a hard-to-swallow sub-plot regarding Anxiety issues for Stark, and underutilizes Guy Pearce in what could have been a world class evil doer. Still, despite all of that, it's fun to watch and Robert Downey Jr will always be Iron Man!",7,1,7,5 May 2013
Marie Antoinette," All the French Dogs you want
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sophie Coppola has two brilliant films to her credit already: 'Lost in Translation' and 'The Virgin Suicides'. Beginning one's directing career with those two can only lead to unrealistic expectations. So, yes I will admit to a bit of anticipation for 'Marie Antoinette', and yes I now feel truly disappointed.Ms. Coppola again shows her remarkable eye with a visual feast of sets, costumes, make-up and poses. What makes this one so tough to take is that she totally forgets to give us a story or make us care about anyone in the film. I will even use the word BORING. The slow pacing works beautifully at first as we are forced to endure the endless string of passionless nights and daytime distance that the two newlyweds go through. However, once Marie gets over that hurdle and decides to live her life, the film should have taken off with fun, frivolity and festiveness. Even the parties seem slow! Kirsten Dunst does an admirable job as the young queen who is so naive and alone and in pain. Watching the film leaves us with the feeling that much of the guts of the film were left on the editing room floor. Jason Schwartzman (so fine in 'Shopgirl' and 'Rushmore') is perfectly cast and he does a nice job of underplaying his character. The wonderful Judy Davis is downright frightening in her scenes with Dunst - is she wearing a neck prosthesis or are those really her neck ligaments? Marianne Faithful (still alive after the Jagger years), Shirley Henderson, Steve Coogan and Rip Torn are all fine in their roles, although Molly Shannon is totally out of place in Versailles.Ms. Coppola again shows her knack for perfect music selections for mood and scene, but it is just not enough to save this one.

The Ring," Rip offs and Hodgepodge
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Ahhh, 'word of mouth'!  The best advertising campaign a movie can have.  Just ask 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'. Positive word of mouth had me anxious to see 'The Ring'.  Not many clever horror/suspense/thrillers come around these days.  It appears the moviegoing public is so starved for this genre, that we can turn mish-mash into success at the box office.  Don't kid yourself.  This is a stupid, poorly made, well conceived milkshake of a movie.  It blatantly steals from the best - 'Poltergeist', 'Psycho', 'Rear Window', 'Rosemary's Baby', and 'The Sixth Sense'.  Even the lead actors appear to be rip-offs:  Naomi Watts (excellent in 'Mulholland Drive') mimics Rebecca DeMorney and Theresa Russell, Martin Henderson takes on Viggo Mortenson and Elias Koteas, and little David Dorfman does his best Haley Joel Osment and Adam Hann-Byrd ('Little Man Tate'). actually have talent.  Director Gore Verbinski ('The Mexican') seems to be a big fan of horror movies and by golly, was going to get every idea he ever had into this one. And I think he had Brian Cox use one electrical appliance for every one of his ideas.  Nice premise with the video tape and 7 days, just poor execution.  The film does offer up some wonderful visuals in dream sequences and video.  The past is much more interesting than the present for these characters.  And I want to nominate Naomi Watts character for the absolute WORST MOTHER OF THE YEAR.  So ridiculous.",6,0,2,28 October 2002
Deja Vu," Don't Worry Baby
","Greetings again from the darkness. Explosions, Noise, Helicopters, Car Chases and guns ... all staples from a Tony Scott/Jerry Bruckheimer production. All of these are most certainly abundant and at the usual sensory overload level. What is a little surprising about this one is the somewhat complex, if almost impossible to believe, story line. Sure time travel and parallel universes are common in film, but the whole criminal element is a nice little twist to the theme.Denzel does his customary strutting through with his favorite partner ... his enormous ego, but it somehow works here. Val Kilmer is drastically underused as Mr. FBI and Adam Goldberg somehow only gets to fire off a couple of wise cracks during his scenes. The spark for the film actually comes from Paula Patton as the victim-or-is-she? and Jesus (Jim Caviezel) as a really bad guy 'patriot' Sure, the film is pure malarkey as far as being reasonable, but as escapism, it is actually much better than anticipated. The best news ... no Jon Bon Jovi or Bryan Adams songs on the soundtrack!",7,19,37,6 December 2006
It," beep beep
","Greetings again from the darkness. There are two clown schools: Funny clowns (Bozo, Ronald McDonald), and Terrifying clowns (the one in POLTERGEIST, Pennywise the Dancing Clown). Stephen King first introduced Pennywise in the 1986 novel, and the great Tim Curry brought him to life (and our nightmares) in the 1990 TV mini-series (2 episodes). So, that's 27 years since the TV version. How fitting that director Andy Muschietti (MAMA) introduces a new generation 27 years later, since that's how often the supernaturally evil clown visits Derry, Maine to frighten and feast on kids. It's a terrific update.Horror films are similar to comedy films in that it often comes down to one's own personality quirks  what makes you laugh, and what scares you. This new version covers the first half of King's novel, focusing on 'The Losers Club' – the seven kids who band together to fight their fears. Director Muschietti sets the story in 1989 (rather than the 50's) and the obvious comparisons are to THE GOONIES, STAND BY ME (another King story), and the recent hit 'Stranger Things'. The opening sequence gets us off to a great start. You've probably seen it in the trailer. Young Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) is joyfully splashing through the rain puddles following his paper boat as it disappears into the storm drain. It's there that he meets, and we get our first look at, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard, son of Stellan and brother of Alexander). Giving us an early peek at what we came to see creates time for the development of a long list of characters. Of course the mini-series and the novel didn't have the time restrictions of a feature film, so it's impressive how quickly we connect with the kids.Georgie's older brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberther, MIDNIGHT SPECIAL) is the leader of The Losers despite his propensity to stutter, and his belief that little Georgie may still be alive. Motormouth Richie (Finn Wolfhard, 'Stranger Things') is the bespectacled wiseass, while Beverly (Sophia Lillis, an Amy Adams lookalike and star in the making) is the tough-on-the-outside female who deals with the rumors that accompany being a teenager. Hypochondriac Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), straight-laced son of the Rabbi Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), chubby brainiac new kid Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), and home-schooled Mike (Chosen Jacobs) round out this group of outsiders who are all frequently the target of bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), creepy parents, and of course, Pennywise.A couple of the set pieces are outstanding. Beverly's bathroom (especially the sink), the creek for the rock fight, and the rickety old house and its corresponding clown lair all contribute to the overall level of menace. Rising star composer Benjamin Wallfisch produces a score that guides us through the thrills and spills, as well as the quieter moments. As for Pennywise, even though the dancing clown had more screen time in the mini-series, Skarsgard is memorable, although the modern day special effects (those teeth!) often diminish the humanistic feel of Curry's clown and escalate things to an other-worldly level. Expect more of the Halloween Haunted House type of scary rather than the emotionally crippling stuff of horror films like THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. The sudden bursts of sinister are surprisingly balanced with the humorous one-liners from the kids, and the actualization of the infamous 'you'll float too' is a stunning effect. The nostalgic feel complements the best part of the story  the power of friendship and connected groups. Watching these kids face their biggest fears certainly provides a bit of a chill to the upcoming fall season  and as a bonus, it's a fun time for viewers.",8,2,11,7 September 2017
Hereditary," clever storytelling for a horror film
","Greetings again from the darkness. I will forever carry this flame of hope for quality horror films since they were such a part of my childhood movie watching. It's such an odd genre because the really good ones are quite rare, but the category in general is quite profitable. We enjoy being frightened and stressed ... in the safety of a dark movie theatre with a few dozen fellow movie goers. This debut feature film from writer/director Ari Aster is filled with foreboding and dread - key elements to a successful horror film.The clever filmmaker spends the first portion of the movie tricking/manipulating us into thinking this is going to be a 'normal' ghost story - one we've seen before, albeit with a stronger than usual cast. Time and again I found myself thinking 'this poor family'. Toni Collette plays Annie, mother of son Peter (Alex Wolff, brother to Nat and son of Polly Draper) and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and wife of Steve (Gabriel Byrne). Some scenes are loaded with realistic family banter - the kind that's a bit passive-aggressive and judgmental in tone. This adds to the unsettling mood of dread that cloaks most of the characters and most every scene.Annie is an artist who creates miniature settings, and once she unloads her family history on an unsuspecting group therapy session, we are provided a big clue, as well as confirmation that the bad times aren't over. When tragedy strikes again, the family seems beyond repair, as do the individuals. Peter is a seemingly normal teenage boy who likes to smoke weed, and dutifully lets his little (and slightly disturbed) sister Charlie tag along to a party since his mother asked. Ms. Shapiro is a revolution in the role - somehow simultaneously both creepy and sympathetic. Father and husband Steve is very patient, a trait that rarely pays off in horror films. The family house makes for a terrific setting, especially considering the impressive treehouse that seems to always require a space heater. Ms. Collette fully commits to the role with all its grief and terror. It's really her performance combined with a creative story that harkens back to THE EXORCIST and ROSEMARY'S BABY, that allow the film to click. By the end, this family only wishes they were in a 'normal' ghost story. And as a reminder, if you are born into a family where one member has a sleep-walking incident similar to what's described here, you have every right to lock your door before going to sleep - that is, assuming you could ever sleep again.",7,1,2,2 July 2018
Minority Report," High-Tech LA Confidential
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I have waited a few days to write so as to make sure I write fairly. The highly anticipated Speilberg/Cruise collaboration is extradorinarily entertaining and fascinating.  I would love to give this a 9 or 10, but the overall lack of character development prevented perfection.  Speilbergs absolute best always offered full characters - if you doubt me, go see 'Jaws' again.  My only negative for the film is the HUGE cast with only one real character (Cruise) and some brief insight provided by Tim Blake Nelson ('O Brother, Where Art Thou') and veteran Jessica Harper as Anne Lively.  The high-tech gadgetry is eye candy and very well utilized for the story.  If anything, Speilberg held the reins on what could have been done in order to make us believe this is 50 years forward.  The opening sequence is unlike anything ever done on film. Watching Cruise and his faceless army pursue Arye Gross BEFORE he commits the murder (his wife is played by Ashley Crow - the mom in 'Little Big League') made me nervous and uncomfortable.  Wonderful cinematography by Speilberg regular Janusz Kaminski and a subtle and powerful score by the incomparable John Williams add more dimension to the movie.  Be sure to stay for the credits and enjoy the Williams piece playing over the first half of the credits.  It is outstanding!  Overall a wonderful movie experience, I just wish there was a more human element to the script.  By the way, does anyone see the similarities to the general story structure with 'LA Confidential'?",8,0,1,27 June 2002
Finding Neverland," Each page of your imagination
","Greetings again from the darkness. This one caught me a bit off guard. Not exactly sure how it is being marketed, but this is an adult story presented in dramatic fashion by director Marc Forster ('Monster's Ball'). Johnny Depp continues his stellar run of spellbinding performances as Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie, who penned the fantastical 'Peter Pan'. Although the film glosses over many of the details of the enigmatic Barrie's life, it does a wonderful job of capturing his fascination with Andrew and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies' kids and their hunger for playtime and childhood. Freddie Highmore as Peter had more than a few moms in the audience reaching for Kleenex. He will next be seen (again alongside Johnny Depp) in Tim Burton's 'Charlie and Chocolate Factory' (a reinterpretation by Burton of 'Willy Wonka'). A slimmed down Kate Winslet and still striking Julie Christie play well against Depp and the kids. Dustin Hoffman (miles from his lead in Spielberg's 'Hook') offers up another nice turn in a supporting role as the theatre owner. Hopefully Hoffman continues embracing these roles as his acting ability really is amazing even though his leading man days are long past. My only concern is that this film will fail to find an audience. It is not a remake of 'Peter Pan' and most kids will probably be bored. Adults, on the other hand, will be enthralled and hopefully recommend to all their friends.",8,0,0,28 November 2004
Training Day," Over the top, all the way around
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Not much to say about this except it is not much fun to watch from any perspective.  Everything is over the top ... the acting, the directing, the story, the music.  It is nice to see Mr. Prima Donna, Denzel, in a bad guy role, but I would much rather see him play a smart/cool bad guy than this loose cannon who would have been shot much earlier in his police career.  Ethan Hawke flops through his role like a fish out of water, and what is the deal with the '3 wise men'?  Looked to be some type of X-files rip off.  Anyway, just a waste of time.",6,24,50,27 March 2002
In Bruges," Plenty of Alcoves in Bruges
","Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.Colin Farrell delivers by far his best performance to date. He is funny, dangerous, sexy and emotional throughout. This is exceptional acting from a guy who tends to disappoint. Of course, it helps to have magnificent writing and this one most certainly delivers on that front. The dialogue is quirky and quick ... so tune in early.Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from 'Gangs of New York' and the Harry Potter series. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. The third piece of the puzzle is Ralph Fiennes as the mastermind bad guy. The supporting work is fine from Jordan Prentice as the dwarf actor (sadly Mr. Prentice is most famous for playing Howard the Duck) and a very cute Clemence Poesy as Farrell's odd love interest.Very few writers can write dialogue like this and even fewer can juggle as many layers without making a film seem busy, crowded or forced. Hopefully Mr. McDonagh will bring more of his work to the big screen ... he certainly adds a touch of class!",9,198,263,9 February 2008
Rocketman," trippy musical biopic
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's billed as a musical fantasy. If you are familiar with Elton John's discography and history, you'll want to keep that in mind as the film unfolds. The reward is a colorful spectacle worthy of one of pop music's most successful songwriters and greatest showmen. Director Dexter Fletcher (EDDIE THE EAGLE, 2015) and writer Lee Hall (BILLY ELLIOT, 2000) make frequent use of Elton's music within the fabric of the storytelling. It's no traditional biopic, nor should it be, given the wild ride of the man whose story is being told.Taron Egerton tears into playing Elton John like it's the role of a lifetime. And he succeeds in a way that makes it seem that could be true. Most of us first recognized Taron's talent as 'Eggsy' in KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE (2014), though I'm not sure we expected such a dynamic step up so soon. This is not some actor merely mimicking the movements of a celebrity. This is an actor taking possession of a role. Without the costumes, Taron doesn't look much like Elton John. He certainly doesn't sound like Elton John ... though his voice does justice to the classic songs. Despite those things, he is captivating on screen, both in the dramatic moments and the musical mania.Elton's childhood and the strained relationship he had with his parents (played here by Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Macintosh) are given much attention, as is the support and love of his grandmother (Gemma Jones). With two self-centered parents wishing he didn't exist, the child piano prodigy might never have attended the Royal Academy of Music if not for grandmother Ivy. Of course, the professional relationship that meant the most to Elton's career was his songwriting collaboration with lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), and much of the film is devoted to this prolific partnership - in fact, one of the most spine-tingling moments occurs as Bernie hands Elton the words to 'Your Song' and Elton proceeds to set it to music right in front of us and Bernie. Whether that's historically accurate or not, it provides a thrilling moment on screen for the creative duo.Elton John in rehab is used as a framing device for the film. This allows him to walk us through his life ... after admitting to having issues with drugs, alcohol, sex, shopping and anger. In other words, one of the most successful musicians of all time was a mess. And we get to sit front row as he details his early sexual confusion, his desire to be loved, his early professional frustration, and finally a career that exploded - covering him with money, adoration, stress, and more frustration. We see the warts and all.Supporting roles are filled by Richard Madden as John Reid, Elton's lover and manager; Tate Donovan as Doug Weston, owner of Sunset Blvd's Troubadour; Rachel Muldoon as Kiki Dee, Elton's collaborator on their big hit 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart'; and Stephen Graham as Dick James, the famous music publisher who first signed Elton.As someone whose favorite Elton albums are 'Tumbleweed Connection', 'Madman Across the Water', and 'Honky Chateau', it's easy for me to appreciate the time period covered here (roughly 1970-1983), and also to recognize the 'artistic license' taken with the timelines and events. His 1970 gig at Troubadour features a rowdy version of 'Crocodile Rock', which wasn't even written yet ... although the scene makes for great cinema. Many of the songs that advance the story are used out of sequence, but it's quite effective to see and hear them in context. His marriage to Renate Blauel and the rehab stint featured both occurred after 1983, which we can assume is the story's stopping point given the use of the 'I'm Still Standing' video as a finale. Even the use of John Lennon over Long John Baldry doesn't really matter since this is all about the spectacle, and for spectacle, you've likely never seen costumes (including eyeglasses and headdresses) used to such startling effect ... and so frequently. The baseball 'uniform' Elton wore during his 1975 Dodger Stadium gig has always made me a bit uncomfortable, but it's recreated beautifully for the film.Given that comparisons to the recent BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY are inevitable, it should be noted that director Dexter Fletcher rescued the final production of that film before finishing this one. Freddie Mercury and Elton John are two of the most fascinating figures in music history, and while both films are enjoyable, it's ROCKETMAN that is willing to take the riskier path by highlighting the flaws of a creative genius. So criticize if you must, but you'll probably still be singing in your seat.",8,3,6,30 May 2019
A Star Is Born," the circle of stardom
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is the 4th iteration I've seen of A STAR IS BORN. First there was writer/director William Wellman's original version in 1937 which won the Oscar for Best Original Story, had 6 other Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), and starred Janet Gaynor and Frederic March (he playing a veteran actor and she a starlet). Next came the 1954 remake with James Mason and the fabulous Judy Garland (he playing a veteran actor, she an upcoming singer/actress). Both were nominated for Oscars, and the film was directed by George Cukor (10 years later would win an Oscar for MY FAIR LADY). 1976 brought the second remake (third version), this one starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. It won a Best Song Oscar for Paul Williams, and was directed by Frank Pierson, known best for writing the oft quoted line 'What we've got here, is a failure to communicate' from COOL HAND LUKE (he also won a Best Screenplay Oscar for DOG DAY AFTERNOON). So perhaps it's understandable that 81 years after the original, Bradley Cooper chooses this familiar story for a generational update and his directorial debut.When it's announced that a new version of this story is being made, the obvious first question anyone asks is 'Who did they cast?' Many were surprised when it was learned that Bradley Cooper had cast himself, and that Lady Gaga would take on the female lead. Sure, we all know Bradley Cooper as an Oscar nominated actor from SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012), AMERICAN HUSTLE (2013), and AMERICAN SNIPER (2014) ... but can he SING? And yes, many had seen Lady Gaga in TV's 'American Horror Story', but could she possibly carry a major film - sans heavy make-up and gimmicky stage gadgetry?The audience reactions are in. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga blow away the 1976 version, and where they rank versus the other two versions, comes down to personal preference. Mr. Cooper delivers an odd, yet effective, performance as the boozy, aimless rocker Jackson Maine. Not only does he mimic Sam Elliott's speaking voice and cadence, his performance seems purposefully close to that of Kristofferson from 42 years ago. The great Sam Elliott does play Cooper's (much) older brother, so the oratory choice makes some sense ... it's just a bit off-putting at first. Cooper is believable as the rocker thanks to his stage presence and charm. We never doubt Jackson Maine is a rock star.The most stunning and pleasant surprise here is Lady Gaga as Ally. For anyone who still thinks of her in terms of raw meat fashion at industry events, prepare yourself for astonishment. Her beautiful and powerful voice is on full display throughout the film. In fact, her songs and singing are the highlights of what is a terrific film that should have wide appeal. The first song she sings, 'La Vie en Rose' (made famous by Edit Piaf) is quite simply jaw-dropping in its beauty.
Ally is a pretty grounded woman from humble means. She works as a waitress and sings whenever she can ... having been held back from pursuing her dreams by a well-meaning father (Andrew Dice Clay) who says she doesn't have the looks to be a star. Ally has a Carole King 'Tapestry' poster on her bedroom wall, and we soon learn she could probably sing most any song from that classic album and make it her own. When Jackson and Ally meet, a complex romance and professional partnership forms. We know those rarely end well. As Jackson shuns his protective brother, battles an ever-worsening hearing issue and a self-destructive drinking problem, Ally tries to remain loyal to the man she loves ... even as her own career explodes down a path Jackson barely recognizes.In addition to the aforementioned Dice Clay (surprisingly subtle here), there is a musical duet with Marlon Williams (in the Roy Orbison tribute) and Presley Cash, and surprising supporting characters played by Dave Chappelle and Eddie Griffin. Probably not as surprising, Jon Peters is listed as a Producer on the film. If you are unfamiliar with Mr. Peters, he was once a hairstylist to celebrities and in the early 1970's fell in love with Barbra Streisand. His first credit as Producer was for her film ... you got it ... A STAR IS BORN (1976).Mr. Cooper does a nice job tackling such a large scale and familiar project for his first directing gig, and we are certainly appreciative of his avoiding inclusion of Streisand's 'Evergreen', and instead showcasing the talents of Lady Gaga. It's likely Lady Gaga will receive a bit more credit for her acting than is probably deserved (an Oscar nom is possible), but her impact on the movie cannot be understated. Bradley Cooper's next project as actor/director has been announced as BERNSTEIN, where he will play the great composer Leonard Bernstein. Kudos to Cooper for dreaming big!",8,24,55,3 October 2018
Gravity," Pale Blue Dot
","Greetings again from the darkness. Hopefully you aren't expecting yet another in the seemingly endless stream of unadulterated praise fests for Alfonso Cuaron's critically beloved and audience pleasing Gravity. While the mass appeal is certainly understandable, I've never been one to sit back and accept the surface value.There are two elements for discussion here: the visually stunning and technical marvel from a filmmaking perspective, and the emotionally-manipulating and somewhat emptiness of the narrative story-telling and characters. On the technical front, one would be hard-pressed to come up with a more impressive film. It is simply breath-taking, especially when seen in the format it should be seen ... 3D IMAX. Rarely, if ever, has space seemed more real, more beautiful and more ominous. From the extended opening take (Cuaron is known for his long takes), to the numerous shots of Planet Earth (from dominating the screen, to reflections in helmet shields), we are drawn in to the space walking and perils of Kowalski (George Clooney) and Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock).From an entertainment viewpoint, the film works as high-stress, thrilling space mission gone bad and ultimate survival story. What left me feeling a bit distracted and hence, quite annoyed, was the often eye-rolling dialogue seemingly designed to force our connection with the Clooney and, especially, Bullock characters. I prefer to experience my own emotions in both real life and in movies ... obvious cues and manipulating tugs through weak character development drives me away from, rather than towards the desired connectivity. My issues with the film are not related to the numerous scientific issues identified by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. This is all explained away by Mr. Cuaron's statement that the film is 'not a documentary'. If we can be cool with Forrest Gump creating the smiley face, we can accept that Sandra Bullock can navigate her way between space stations with a fire extinguisher.Despite this, it's tough to argue against the technical marvel and thrilling experience created here. The 3D adds depth of field and adds a touch of realism, rather than the gimmicky tricks we often see with the format. With only a couple of jarring exceptions, Steven Price's score is minimal and complimentary to the quietness of space. Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men) re-teams with Cuaron for the extraordinary look. Some of the symbolism was a bit overdone - recurring umbilical imagery for the re-birth, but it's done to ensure no viewer misses the point. Finally, I got a kick out of Ed Harris' voice coming from Mission Control (think back to The Right Stuff and Apollo 13).",7,2,5,8 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Never Out of the Fight
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is one of those times where, in order to analyze a movie, one must separate from the emotion of the subject matter. In the traditional sense, this is not a great movie. However, in terms of practicality, the true story and characters and their actions, leave us emotionally exhausted and questioning whether any war actually makes sense. The other thing it does is bring to light just what impressive beings these brave soldiers really are.The story is taken from the book (co-written by Patrick Robinson) and real experience of Marcus Luttrell. A Texan and member of Navy SEAL Team 10, Luttrell was one of four chosen for the June 2005 Operation Red Wings ... the capture or kill of al Qaeda bad guy Ahmad Shahd. Dropped into the Afghanistan Hindu Kush mountains, the mission goes horribly wrong once the group is stumbled upon by goat herders. The Rules of Engagement provide guidance that is supported by CNN concerns ... and the decision is made to release them and call off the mission.To say all hell breaks loose after that is simply an understatement. The four SEALs face insurmountable odds that end according to the spoiler title. If you have seen Blackhawk Down or the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, then you have some idea of what to expect on screen as these elite soldiers fight for their lives and their country. The intensity and visceral violence is impossible to describe here. The bullets rip flesh and bone, while desperate re-grouping efforts lead to horrendous tumbles down rocky cliffs.The movie begins with a glimpse at SEAL training, followed by a few minutes of base life ... the competitiveness, the bonding, the breeding of fighting machines. Director Peter Berg does allow for a peek at humanity and personality, but the Band of Brothers culture is unmistakable. When one of them states 'moderation is for cowards', we never doubt for a second that this is part of their psyche.The four Seals are played by Mark Wahlberg (Marcus Luttrell), Taylor Kitsch (Michael Murphy), Emile Hirsch (Danny Dietz), and Ben Foster (Matt 'Axe' Axelson). While they are all believable, this is not an actor's seminar. Neither is it a geopolitical editorial. Partisanship is non-existent here. Rather, we are reminded of the sacrifice that comes with war, and left to decide for ourselves if this approach is the best we can do.The real Marcus Luttrell makes an appearance in the movie ... he is the SEAL that spills coffee and tells the rookie to clean it up. Finally, as director Berg was meeting with the families prior to filming, this quote came from Danny Dietz's father after reading the obituary: 'That's who my son was. That's how hard he fought. Make sure you get that right'.",7,2,9,21 January 2014
Wind River," good, bad and snow
","Greetings again from the darkness. With his two most recent screenplays, Sicario (2015) and the Oscar nominated Hell or High Water (2016), Taylor Sheridan seemed acutely attuned to the fine line between right and wrong, and the twisted complexity of new age American values when contrasted with 'old school'. This time out, he both writes and directs. The themes remain familiar while the landscape shifts to the frozen tundra of Wyoming.We first meet Fish & Wildlife Service tracker/hunter Cory (Jeremy Renner) as he picks off (with a long range rifle) a pack of wolves that is methodically encircling goats on a ranch. A very similar type situation plays out later in the film  only with humans in place of wolves and sheep. Not long after dispensing with the wolves, Cory stumbles upon the barefoot corpse of a young girl he recognizes as the former best friend of his daughter. Her frost-bitten bare feet visible, face buried in the snow, bleeding from an apparent assault, and miles from the nearest house or dwelling, the girl's corpse is telling a story that Cory knows requires the immediate attention of law enforcement.Ben, the Native American Reservation Police Chief (Graham Greene) has jurisdiction unless the Medical Examiner rules it a homicide. In the meantime, FBI Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) shows up dressed more for winter in her native Florida than the brutally cold Wyoming plains. Jane quickly proves she is no ordinary 'fish out of water' (even if she lacks experience for such a case), and commissions Cory to help her out with the local people and land.The film has many ties to the fine TV series 'Longmire', and though Mr. Renner and Ms. Olsen are well known in the Marvel Universe as Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, there are no superheroes present here – just a convoluted society within a seemingly forgotten (or at least) ignored part of the country. It's a police procedural blanketed in the always-falling snow, an underground drug culture, and the quiet animosity between the outside world and the Reservation (where many have given up hope).These aren't people that talk much, although they say plenty. Sometimes the dialogue is a bit too obvious in Mr. Sheridan's goal of leaving no viewer behind, especially when combined with overly detailed flashback that will have the amateur sleuths in the audience feeling a bit letdown in receiving a full explanation. However, when cinematographer Ben Richardson (Beasts of the Southern Wild, The Fault in Our Stars) loses the shaky-cam from indoors, and beautifully lays out the vastness of the snow vistas, forest and mountains, the remoteness and stunning landscape becomes a character as important as any other.The supporting cast is stellar and features Julia Jones, Gil Birmingham (Jeff Bridges' partner in Hell or High Water), Jon Bernthal, Kelsey Asbille, and a crazed James Jordan. Mr. Greene adds a touch of deadpan humor and resignation to his plight, while Ms. Olsen is effective as the 'green' agent dealing with an unfamiliar white-out. Mr. Renner truly excels as the throwback cowboy carrying out his duties while bearing a burden exacerbated by this case. The crunching snow, predatory lions, and high-speed snowmobiling never cause us (or Cory) to lose sight of how important it is to know the land and the people  and walk that line between right and wrong.",7,3,9,14 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," not the sharpest satire
","Greetings again from the darkness. Having previously lampooned the political landscape of England (IN THE LOOP, 'The Thick of it') and the United States ('Veep'), writer/director Armando Iannucci turns his skewering pen and clear eye to a bygone era in Russia. Based on the graphic novel by Fabien Nury, the film takes place in 1953 Moscow at the height (and the end) of Josef Stalin's reign.Stalin's NKVD Security Forces (think 'Secret Police') ruled by force and terror for 20 years, and most citizens lived with the daily goal of staying off 'the list' - a place which likely resulted in imprisonment, if not death. An opening sequence featuring the live performance of an orchestra drives home the outright fear that hovered over every part of that society. To be clear, Iannucci's approach is less ominous and more Mel Brooks. It's slapstick satire with profanity. Following the death of Stalin (it's not a spoiler if it's in the title!), what follows is a Keystone Cops medley of jockeying for power amongst the members of Stalin's cabinet. Closed-door plotting abounds - though sometimes in full view of others - and alliances come and go in the blink of an eye. It plays out on screen as more spoof than satire, so brace for over-the-top performances from Steve Buscemi (as Nikita Khrushchev), Simon Russell Beale (as Lavrenti Beria), Jeffrey Tambor as dimwitted doofus Malenkov, and Monty Python alum Michael Palin as Molotov. Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough play Stalin's (Adrian McLoughlin) offspring, and other supporting work comes from Olga Kurylenko, Paddy Considine, Tom Brooke, and Jason Isaacs.I watched this film the day after watching RED SPARROW, and the two films provide an interesting and oddball comparison to different eras of Russian history. Iannucci's film is nothing short of a full bore attack on Kremlin activities, as well as the self-interested actions of politicians that seems to remain prevalent in modern days. It's also a reminder that being 'better as a committee' has as many flaws as the rein of a tyrant. There is a terrific final shot in a concert hall, where seated behind Khrushchev and his wife is a leering Leonid Brezhnev ... foreshadowing future events. And if that's not enough, the closing credits are as nuts as the film itself.",6,1,5,9 March 2018
Meet the Parents," Trailer Overload
","Greetings again from the darkness.  This is a cute movie with some great comedy, ruined for me by the Hollywood brass that decided to spend 2 months promoting the movie by blowing every punch line and sight gag in the movie, save one (the 'drag racing' scene).  I do think there should be a law or rule, that only allows ONE Ben Stiller movie per year.  He is good in small doses.  DeNiro is his usual scene-chewing greatness as the over-bearing dad, Gwyneth's mom (Blythe Danner) is wasted (and looks out of sync) as the too-quiet mom.  Owen Wilson has a nice turn and should consider specializing in the character actor role.  If you have not seen more than 3 previews to this movie, you should go.  I BEG you Hollywood, give us credit ... we will go see your movie if it is well written and well acted.  Don't ruin it for us before we arrive!  My special note on this one is that one of the producers is the former goofy stand-up comedian, Emo Phillips.  Also, kudos to Jay Roach for his direction.  This is a giant step from the underrated 'Blown Away'.",7,0,1,21 October 2000
I'm Not There," Just Like a Woman
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Todd Haynes won me over with his indie hit 'Far From Heaven'. Here he blows me away with his avant-garde Dylan inspired web of song and real-life influenced vignettes held together by six different aspects of the legend, who, as per the title, is not actually present.The six spirits of Dylan are played by Ben Whishaw (Arthur Rimbaud influence), Christian Bale (as he converts to Christianity), Marcus Carl Franklin (as a young bluesman using the name of the legendary Woody Guthrie) Richard Gere (as western recluse modeled on the legend of Billy the Kid), Heath Ledger (as an actor from the mod 60's era), and the most stunning performance of all, Cate Blanchett, in an all-out spot-on impersonation of Mr. Dylan.The stories are not told chronologically, instead Mr. Haynes opts to mix 'em up and toss them at us as if they were pieces of a puzzle to assemble, or better yet, the lyrics to a Dylan song! Additionally, we get clips of real life, in fact much of the Christian Bale segment is done documentary style. We gets bits of MLK, JFK, LBJ and the Black Panthers with Hewey Newton and Bobby Seale. That's in addition to the Beatles, Allen Ginsburg and Coco, a nod to Edie Sedgewick (played well by Michelle Williams).In the Heath Ledger story, we are presented with his wife Claire, who apparently is a mixture of Dylan women and lyrics, complete with painful relationship goodies. Claire is played perfectly by Charlotte Gainsbourg as she shows us how even those closest to him, never really know him. Bruce Greenwood has a couple of roles as a very persistent British interviewer and as old man Garrett (as in Pat) in the Gere story. One of the coolest parts is seeing the great Richie Havens pick his guitar on the porch in the Woody Guthrie story.This is just an amazing blend of eras and personalities and super-creativity from all involved. I was mesmerized and engaged as I tried to pick out real quotes, real clothes, real moments and those that were based on lyrics and myths (Pete Seeger axing the cable in Newport).I worry that this won't find the audience it deserves. One need not be a Dylan freak to 'get' this film. You just have to love multi-layered story telling and some of the most influential music of the modern era. This is wonderful movie making and pure joy to behold.",8,4,11,25 November 2007
The Big Lebowski," Dude, let's go logjammin'
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I have fought this for quite some time, but must now give it up for the greatness that is ... the Coen Brothers. Bad pub made me stay away from Lebowski on its theatrical release, and am just now getting around to it.  What a gem! Truly brilliant casting and the Coen's now customary bizarre dialog make this one something special.  Who, but the Coens, would cast Steve Buscemi as a former surfer or Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) as a nihilist?  Yes, we expect perfection from Jeff Bridges every time - here he delivers.  Is he a slacker or just a decent guy who doesn't wish his rug soiled?  Bridges perfectly captures the spirit of the dude.  Goodman is his usual over-the-top self, only moreso.  His dialog seems at time pulled straight from 'Casino', if you f** know what I f** mean.  The beautiful Julianne Moore seems a bit disinterested in her role until her wonderful scene for improving conception.  Philip Seymour Hoffman again shows why he is absolutely the best young character actor working today.  Tara Reid ('Cruel Intentions' and 'American Pie') has a brief yet effective role as teh trophy wife with confusing intentions.  David Huddleston steals his scenes for the first time since 'Blazing Saddles' and Coen regular, John Turturro is terrifically offbeat as Jesus the wonder bowler.  Sam Elliot lends a touch of class as the stranger, and don't miss Aimee Mann ('til Tuesday) and Ben Gazarra.  Another aspect that we have come to expect in Coen movies is a wonderful soundtrack.  Lebowski provides us with Dylan and Costello along with the wonderful work of Carter Burwell. This movie begs for repeat viewings, but do brace yourself for the boundary pushing.",8,1,2,28 August 2001
Unbreakable," Comic Book Villain
","Greetings once again from the darkness.  Hopefully you are reading this and any other review AFTER seeing this movie.  Too much information will rob you of much of the moviegoing joy during this one.  Understated performance by Bruce Willis vs. Flamboyant Samuel L. Jackson help deliver the remarkable story in true mystery fashion (not SLOW as some say).  Unique and cutting edge camera work, a brief scene with the director (becoming a Shyamalan signature) and unparalled symbolism make this a truly fun experience for a movie lover. Shyamalan has hooked us with his feel for the supernatural and things that we dream about.  Shyamalan understands and presents children in rarely seen, realistic fashion as seen in 'Sixth Sense' 'Stuart Little' screenplay and Spencer Clark in 'Unbreakable').  My tidbit on this one is that The music is written by James Newton Howard who has become amazingly prolific with 25 film scores in the past 5 years.  The DVD director's cut of this movie will be a blast!",8,1,2,27 November 2000
Star Trek," Dammit Jim!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Full disclosure: I am not a Trekie and I have a personal rule - any film with Bruce Greenwood sucks. So imagine my pleasant surprise when I actually enjoyed JJ Abrams newest reincarnation of the franchise AND Mr. Greenwood plays a pivotal role! No doubt serious Star Trek fans will be disappointed in the content. Sci-fi details play a minuscule role in this wide-eyed, special effects feast. This film is closer to being 'Spider-man' than it is to being a science fiction lesson. As a matter of fact, the black hole creations are a bit humorous to even a science dope like me. Still for two hours you can't take your eyes off the screen ... except when the idiot behind you keeps kicking your seat.Casting is stellar and really helps the film work. Chris Pine (so excellent in Bottle Shock as the goofy son) and Zachary Quinto (Heroes) are terrific as Jim Kirk and Spock, the early years. We see the early head-butting and foundation for the friendship. An unrecognizable Eric Bana plays bad guy Nero and Karl Urban is very good as the serious Bones McCoy. Beautiful Zoe Saldana seems to overact a bit as Uhura and Simon Pegg livens up the film, even though he seems misplaced, as Scotty.Don't miss Winona Ryder as Spock's mom, Jennifer Morrison (House) as Kirk's mom in intergalactic labor and ultra-rich Tyler Perry as the Admiral in charge of the hearing for a cheating Jim Kirk. All nice touches by TV guru, Abrams. Still, by far the most fun, is Leonard Nimoy's time on screen. He brings a majestic presence and a touch of class and history to his role. Very cool.Music is fine, but you have to wait for the end credits to hear the original theme song (written by creator Gene Roddenberry). JJ Abrams has delivered a very watchable and exciting chapter to the Star Trek franchise ... not a simple thing to do in light of some of the past attempts.",7,2,11,10 May 2009
Fury," Killin' Nazis
","Greetings again from the darkness. When a filmmaker takes on WWII, he better have something new to say or a new way to show it. Director David Ayer (highly recommend his End of Watch, 2012) literally takes us inside a Sherman tank with its crew of 5 men, including their leader played by Brad Pitt.Having the tank as a centerpiece brings a level of claustrophobia to the treacherous German war front. The battle scenes are excruciatingly tense, and actually beautifully filmed. This may seem an odd description for a war movie, but bouncing from inside the tank to the German countryside is done with such style that it provides contrast to the brutality and violence of war.Pitt's crew is made up of Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal (especially good). They are forced to take on a rookie with no tank training ... but he can type 60 words per minute. Logan Lerman plays the rookie and he brings the natural sensitivity we've come to expect from his roles in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Noah. We buy off on the difficult transition since the others have fought campaigns together in Africa, Belgium and France.What works here are the battle sequences. What doesn't really work are the numerous moments of personal drama injected to help us understand how war can change a man ... no matter how hard he tries to hold on to his humanity. The sequence with the two German women, a piano and fried eggs seems especially drawn out and unbelievable. We understand the point pretty quickly, but the extended sequence becomes quite awkward.The most interesting question the movie asks is whether a soldier can be so disgusted and sick of war, yet somehow addicted to the action. Mr. Ayers previously wrote U-571 (2000), so he is clearly interested in the mentality of soldiers in a claustrophobic setting. More of this approach would have been welcome here.",6,4,13,18 October 2014
Darkest Hour," a turning point
","Greetings again from the darkness. Cinematic historical dramas, by definition, face the challenge of overcoming a known and documented outcome. Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) and writer Anthony McCarten (Oscar nominated for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING) attempt to re-create the tension-packed few days that literally changed the course of history and the free world.It's May 9, 1940 and the film takes us through the next 3 weeks of political wrangling that begins with Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) being named Prime Minister almost by default, as he's the only candidate acceptable to both parties to replace an ill and weak war time leader Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup). Even King George VI (Ben Mendolsohn) is skeptical of Churchill and prefers Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane), his friend who is likely better suited as Churchill's adversary and a contrarian than as the actual decision- maker in this crucial time. Uncertainty abounds within the government and the top priority of debate is whether to negotiate a peace treaty with Hitler and Nazi Germany, or fight on against seemingly impossible odds in hope of maintaining the nation's freedom. Perspective is required here, as at this point, Germany was viewed as an unstoppable military force with Hitler as the leader. The war atrocities and his despicable vision were not yet fully understood. FDR and the United States declined to help and Churchill had few allies inside or outside his country.We can talk all you'd like about history, but more than anything, this is a showcase for the best working actor who has never won an Oscar, Gary Oldman. This is an actor who has played Lee Harvey Oswald and Sid Vicious, and probably should have won the award in 2012 for TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. Earlier this year, I was impressed with Brian Cox as the lead in CHURCHILL (which was set four years later), but Oldman's Churchill looks, sounds and moves like the real thing. We see the familiar profile and silhouette in numerous shots, and it's actually kind of thrilling.The always great Kristin Scott Thomas plays wife Clementine, and she shines in her too few scenes. Lily James plays Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's bright-eyed secretary and confidant, and she has a couple of nice exchanges with Winston – especially the one explaining the 'V' hand gesture. Another favorite line has a character state, 'I love to listen to him. He has 100 ideas every day  4 of which are good  96 of which are dangerous.' It's this type of writing that emphasizes the opposite approaches between this film and Christopher Nolan's DUNKIRK, which utilized minimal dialogue as opposed to the emphasis on words taken by Mr. Wright's film.We go inside the House of Commons to experience real political gamesmanship, and see the hectic activities inside the war room as typewriters are being pounded while strategies and alliances are being formed. It's an example of politics driven by a fear of action (by most) while there is a touch of hero worship as Churchill stands alone for much of the film. Some creative license is taken as Churchill rides the Underground (subway) in order to connect with citizens and take their pulse on war  despite most having no clue just how desperate things are. We see tremendous and tragic shots of Calais, and the wide range of camera work really stands out thanks to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who also masters the indoor lighting and shading.Operation Dynamo at Dunkirk is discussed briefly (this would be the perfect companion piece to Christopher Nolan's masterpiece from earlier this year), but mostly this is the personalization of those who politicize war. The good and bad of history is made up of people, good and bad. Yes, there are a few too many Hollywood moments here, but Oldman does capture the pressure, isolation and belief of the historical figure who helped save a country, and perhaps the world. We hear two of Churchill's most famous speeches: the 'Never Surrender' speech to Parliament and 'We shall fight them on the beaches ' prompted by the red glow of the 'on air' radio light. There are many published books that provide more detail, but Oldman's performance does guide us through what the Prime Minister must have gone through  and that's worth a ticket and a gold statue.",7,2,10,7 December 2017
Monster," Crimson, Clover and Creepy
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Tough docudrama on convicted serial killer Aileen Wournos.  Director Patty Jenkins aims to present a character study on one of the few female serial killers in US history.  This is a well-known story without much mystery, just plenty of anguish.  'Lee' had a miserable childhood that just developed into prostitution for survival. Shows what can happen when you have no love or compassion.  We get a glimpse of her teen years when she so desperately wanted someone to take a liking to her, but she simply lacked the social skills to allow this to happen. Charlize Theron is mesmerizing and unrecognizable as Wournos.  The combination of weight gain, make-up and mannerisms bring Wournos to life - she becomes this messed up human being longing for companionship.  Her relationship with the coniving 'Shelby' (Christina Ricci) is almost as painful to watch as the killings.  This film is not easy to watch, but Theron's performance makes it a must for film lovers.  Check out the nice supporting roles from Pruitt Taylor Vince, Scott Wilson and veteran (and rarely seen) Bruce Dern.",7,1,2,11 January 2004
Inglourious Basterds," Business is a-Boomin'
","Greetings again from the darkness. Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers are whom I depend to always deliver something never previously seen on screen. Creativity of itself is not sufficient ... but when combined with a love and mastery of film-making, more often than not we are treated to something special. QT certainly delivers that with the Basterds.I found Chapter One (of Five) to be a mini-spaghetti western film short replete with perfect music, anticipation, stare downs, word play, a shoot-out and ultimate escape. Christoph Waltz immediately seizes his role as Col Landa and never lets go. He envisions himself, not as the 'Jew Hunter' (a moniker he relishes, nonetheless) but rather as a super sleuth in line with Sherlock Holmes (hence the pipe!).Chapter Two introduces us to the titular Basterds led by Lt Aldo Raine with Brad Pitt as the hillbilly ring leader of the Dirty Dozen-type band of Nah-Zee killers. Pitt's exaggerated jaw and outlandish accent, coupled with his QT-penned dialogue, makes for one frightening cartoon character on a singular mission. And at the same time, it is a real hoot! The multiple story lines begin to intermingle in a fabulously intricate tavern scene. The dialgoue and approach to this remind a bit of Reservoir Dogs, but with the subtle facial gestures and multi-lingual word play, it goes to a whole different level. While many thought this scene dragged, I was fascinated.The finale in the Cinema Paradiso (not really, but it was the first thing I thought of) is well paced and delivers a fabulous ending of dramatic violent intimacy in the projector room and flamboyant special effects in the main theatre. Let's just say Lincoln's last night at the theatre ended better than Hitler's and Goebbel's.So many movie references in the 2 and a half hours that you can't help but tip your cap to Mr. Tarantino. For us movie lovers, he really is our leader. He is living out our fantasy and delivering just often enough to keep us fed. As an example, the lead up to the Cinderella scene is just pure torture as QT works in his foot fetish. Having previously mentioned the work of Pitt and the fantastic turn by Christoph Waltz, I must also say that Melanie Laurent in her red dress, helped capture the feel of 40's and 50's femme fatales. She was absolutely perfect.While this one is not quite at the level of Pulp Fiction, it is purely a cinematic marvel. Though not the most accurate of history lessons, there is still a bit of message that sneaks in. But more importantly, the message of cinematic adoration can't be missed. Bravo Mr. Tarantino. And thank you again.",8,21,44,25 August 2009
Captain Marvel," origin story with 90's retro
","Greetings again from the darkness. Girl Power! Not only does this serve as an origin story for Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, but Anna Boden becomes the first female director of a Marvel movie (she co-directed with Ryan Fleck, and they previously collaborated on IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY, SUGAR, and HALF NELSON). It's Marvel's first solo female superhero movie, and even though it's actually a prequel to what we've previously seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it clearly sets the table for AVENGERS: ENDGAME and the showdown with Thanos later this year.Oscar winner Brie Larson (ROOM) stars as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, and the film opens with her as Vers, a human-Kree hybrid and a soldier of Starforce being trained by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) for a role in the Kree-Skrulls war. Part of the training includes regular reminders to keep her emotions under control ... see, not only is Vers a woman but she also shoots sonic blasts from her fists. The filmmakers have not presented her story in chronological order, but have instead utilized flashbacks and memories to let us (and Carol) in on how she obtained her immense powers.In Marvel tradition, the film uses much humor as it progresses. Proving that the action takes place in the 1990's, the roof literally comes down on a Blockbuster video store (foreshadowing future financial events), as Vers crashes to earth. Soon she has met young agents Fury and Coulson, played by digitally de-aged Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg, respectively. This is of course pre-eye patch Fury, though we do get that origin story a bit later in the film. As Vers peruses the Blockbuster shelves, we get a tip of the cap to THE RIGHT STUFF and TRUE LIES, and soon thereafter, a nod to Radio Shack, pay phones, pinball machines, pagers, and 90's era internet speed. The retro bits may be a bit overdone, but the millennial target audience will surely enjoy.The always interesting Ben Mendelsohn plays Talos, the leader of the shape-shifting Krulls - who also sport the best make-up as they transform from pointy-eared green aliens into exact replicas of humans. Lee Pace returns as Ronan the Accuser, while Djimon Hounsou is Korath and Gemma Chan is Minn-Erva, both part of Starforce. Annette Bening plays the AI Supreme Intelligence, while Mckenna Grace appears as young Carol in flashbacks.The glimpses of Carol Danvers as a US Air Force fighter pilot lead to the best dramatic scenes of the film - her reuniting with fellow pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and Maria's daughter Monica (Akira Akbar). At first I was taken aback that Marvel dared cast a black actress in the role of stereotypical supportive sidekick, but then Ms. Lynch got her own impressive action chase sequence (similar to STAR WARS) and kicked some serious alien tail. Those familiar with the comics know that Maria Rambeau is the mother of Photon, a character likely to appear deeper in the universe.The co-directors also co-wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve contributed to the story. The strong female presence is impressive both on camera and off, as Pinar Toprak's score complemented the heavy 1990's rock music soundtrack. Again, nostalgia seems ever-present, as does the humor (Goose the cat/flerken) and good fun that existed in THOR: RAGNAROK and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. Carol Danvers and her backstory also seem a bit more relatable than that of WONDER WOMAN.Marvel offered up a nice tribute to the late Stan Lee by providing a new opening featuring his many cameos over the years. And yes, he was able to film his cameo for this one prior to his death in November 2018. So we have an origin story not just of Captain Marvel, but also of the Fury eye patch, the Avengers Initiative, and a prequel to all Marvel movies we've seen in the past few years. Two post-film stingers are included: one expected and necessary, while the other is good for a laugh. It's an inspiring story of a young girl who repeatedly fell down and got up and brushed herself off every time - even before her fists and eye balls could shoot energy streams. It's fitting and about time that young girls now have their own superhero to emulate.",6,24,49,6 March 2019
Iron Man 2," It's good to be back
","Greetings again from the darkness. No secret that I really enjoyed the first Iron Man movie a couple of years ago. For 2, we get the return of key players: Robert Downey, jr as Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and Jon Favreau as the director. We also get an onslaught of new players: Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Scarlett Johansson as Natalie/Natasha/Black Widow, Garry Shandling as Senator Stern and Don Cheadle (replacing Terence Howard) as War Machine.Onslaught may be the best word I can use to describe the film. It is an onslaught to the senses. There are so many characters - both good and bad. There are so many explosions, fights and booms that we resist the urge to blink. There is so much overlapping and oddly paced dialogue that we strain to fill in the blanks. And what of the inside jokes and 'advertising' for future Avengers fun? OK, maybe 'Fun' is the key word, not onslaught. These characters are a blast (pun, slightly intended). Watching a creepy Mickey Rourke plot revenge in the Russian darkness is terrific. Sam Rockwell chewing scenery is not to be missed. Garry Shandling's snarky senator is a hoot, especially at the end. And I have been surfing the net all night searching for a suitcase sized Iron Man suit. OK, not really ... but that was super cool.The best I can offer here is that this is an onslaught of fun. The great and talented Justin Theroux was brought in to script the multitude of players and story lines ... he must be a master juggler as none get cheated in their screen time. Even Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is given a much heavier workload than in part one - setting the stage for his NINE scheduled film appearances as Mr. Fury.The film is huge and spectacular, but falls just short of the first one for a single reason. The wow of discovery can only be had once. That's not a knock on this one, but timing is crucial. Must also mention the brilliance of Robert Downey, Jr who seems born to play Tony Stark. Of course, the brilliance of Mr. Downey is that he always seems born to play his roles. He is a great actor ... check his ability to spout wise cracking one-liners and then mix in a couple of actually tender moments with Paltrow's Pepper Potts. Not many actors could do that effectively. He pulls it off seamlessly.What really matters is that it's a fun trip to theatre. Don't expect this year's Best Picture winner. Expect to laugh and be visually wowed. I certainly was.",6,0,1,9 May 2010
Two for the Money," Chaucer's flip of the coin
","Greetings again from the darkness. Was very happy to catch an early screening of this after seeing the trailer. The one definite that the film (and filmmaker) knows is that the camera loves Matthew McConaughey. His dimples, blinding white teethy smile and beefcake body are all on full display here. MM does have a southern silkiness and charm on screen, but we just never believe the river runs very deep.Director D.J. Caruso ('Taking Lives' and a bunch of TV stuff) never quite captures the pure sleaze of behind the scenes sports betting. There are so many stereotypical moments, characters and scenes that this viewer experienced more than a couple of eye rolls, not the least of which was the ridiculously sappy ending. Al Pacino is at his over-the-top usual. Somewhere along the way, Pacino stopped acting and just started yelling his lines. He is no longer the brooding, cool guy of 'Bobby Deerfield' or 'The Godfather', but now seems eternally stuck in his 'Scarface' and 'The Insider' roles as a screaming madman. Rene Russo provides steady duty as Pacino's muse and wife, as does the wonderful Jeremy Piven. Armand Assante also shines as a very scary rich client whom I would not want upset at me.The treatment of addiction - alcohol, betting, drugs, etc. is touched upon, but we are not given any real insight into the struggles these individuals face on a daily basis. The film is watchable purely as a star vehicle for McConaughey and Pacino and just a sampling of the sleaze that compiles this huge industry.",5,16,37,8 September 2005
World War Z," Be Very Quiet, We're Hunting Zombies
","Greetings again from the darkness. Max Brooks' hugely successful novel was put through the proverbial wringer on it's road to the big screen. Numerous script re-writes, many scenes re-shot, a re-worked third act, an all new ending, and a 6 month delay in release date. The final product is something that fans of TV's 'The Walking Dead' will probably appreciate and many others will find it entertaining enough.Brad Pitt gives an earnest effort as a former United Nations investigator who now enjoys his new role as house-husband. In fact, director Marc Foster (Quantum of Solace, Monster's Ball) zaps us with the first zombie action just after Pitt serves up pancakes to his two daughters and wife Karin (Mireille Enos, 'The Killing'). It turns out Pitt is more than just an expert at flapjacks. His expertise is needed in this global zombie crisis brought on by a virus ...or bacteria, that started in India ... or Israel ... or Asia. See, those details don't really matter because the infection has spread to every corner of the globe.I actually enjoyed Pitt more in the 'quiet' moments than in the big CGI action sequences. He is quite believable as a doting husband and father, less so as the world's savior. Still, the issues with this movie are not on Mr. Pitt. Four writers (in addition to the novelist) rarely deliver a coherent script' however, since it's an apocalyptic zombie thriller, they almost get away with it! If you haven't visited the zombie genre in a few decades, be prepared ... these aren't the sluggish zombies made famous by George Romero. Instead, these are blazingly fast and able to leap tall buildings, flying helicopters ... and the great wall of Jerusalem. Yes, Jerusalem. In one of the more unusual movie features, this one plays like 'Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?'. Pitt globe trots more than James Bond or Jason Bourne.For many, the zombie sequences and global apocalyptic theme will provide sufficient cinematic entertainment. For the rest of us, it's fine, but will forgotten as quickly as I am Legend.",5,19,40,23 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Don't Fear the Reaping
","Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read the Young Adult novels of Suzanne Collins, my comments will be limited to the movie only and not a comparison to the books. The screenplay was a joint affair from Ms. Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross (Seabiscuit). Whether or not you read the books, you surely know that this has been an anticipated film version in the vein of Twilight and Harry Potter. My analysis is that it falls short of Harry and is superior to the vamps.What this film definitely is ... proof that Jennifer Lawrence is for real. She burst onto the scene in her Oscar nominated turn in Winter's Bone and once again, her squirrel recipes come in handy. Lawrence plays Katniss Everdeen, a tough as nails and very resourceful resident of the dirt poor District 12. She provides for her little sis and their emotionally vacant mother, and does so by honing her bow and arrow skills hunting in the vast woodlands.Without going into too much detail, the dystopian world of Panem is divided into 12 districts and a Capitol. As a combination entertainment and price for a previous rebellion, an annual lottery is held to select a boy and girl from each district ... 'tributes' to their community. Those drawing the proverbial short straw are entered into brutal fight to the death, where 23 are to be killed and one left standing. In the 74th annual Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take the place of her little sister. So she and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, The Kids are All Right) are whisked away to the Capitol to meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a one time winner who celebrates daily by downing as much alcohol as possible.In stark contrast to the hopeless community from which they arrive, the Capitol is a gleaming, bright-colored land of enchantment filled with wildly costumed residents seemingly bored by the atrocity of the annual event. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, American Beauty) is the man in charge of staging and manipulating the event for the highest possible ratings and entertainment value. He carries out his duties while sporting a very unique satanic beard, unlike you have seen before.After prepping, the tributes appear in front of a futuristic Ryan Seacrest played by the flamboyant Stanley Tucci. His Caesar Flickerman is charged with interviewing so as to help the audience make a connection. Lenny Kravitz plays Cinna, a futuristic Tom Ford clone whose duties are to make Katniss and Peeta 'presentable'.It takes a full hour, but the actual Hunger Games finally begins. Quickly the faceless characters disappear and the game of brutality and brains begins. Lawrence is truly a standout here since she has tremendous ability as an actress, and sells her athletic ability quite well. I can't say I was as taken by Mr. Hutcherson, who spends most of the film looking like a wounded puppy.While the PG-13 rating keeps it from becoming a gore fest, I found the action sequences to be quite entertaining. More interesting to me was how the story and characters are posed so that a viewer might interpret meaning in just about any manner one cares to twist. There are political views and human nature traits and commentary on the Reality TV world that are primed for claiming ... regardless of one's opinion. To me, that's a weakness. I would rather the story take a stand and make a statement. But then I remind myself that this is the first in a trilogy of Young Adult stories. It's not designed for deep thought. The movie succeeds in reaching the goal of producing a strong young female character in a world run amok.",7,0,9,3 April 2012
The Impossible," Cry Me a Tsunami
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio C Sanchez reunite for their follow-up to The Orphanage (2007). What separates this from the long list of disaster films is that it's exceedingly well made, it's based on a true story, and it puts a young actor in a role vital to the connection with audience.The real life Belon family from Spain have for some reason been presented here (by Spanish filmmakers) as the British Bennett's with Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts (as Henry and Maria). They are on vacation at a beach resort with their three boys Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). In the beginning the resort plays like paradise. Unfortunately, this is Thailand in 2004 when one of the worst natural disasters of all-time hits ... a Tsunami with enormous force and monstrous waves.Filmed with remarkable intensity, we see Maria and Lucas (separated from the others) struggle mightily to survive and stay together. This 10 minute sequence leaves the audience spent and gasping for air. Rarely do we witness such realistic near-drownings on screen. The film soon breaks into two simultaneous acts: the fight for survival by Maria and Lucas; and the quest to find them by Henry, Thomas and Simon.The first half of the film is the strongest portion and it deals with the storm and it's aftermath. The second half is very emotional and focuses on the courage of Lucas and the strength of Maria. It's one of the most unique combination tales of survival and family love that we've seen. The filmmakers wisely choose to let the story follow the family and not throw in cheap parlor tricks like TV newscasts. We all remember those reports, and the actual film does a terrific job of recreating those images.Acting by the leads take this to elite status. Ewan McGregor turns in what is his best performance in quite some time. His phone call home scene is excruciating to watch. Naomi Watts delivers what is likely an Oscar nominated performance, despite being almost unrecognizable while laying in a hospital bed during much of the film. The real star and soul of the film is Tom Holland as the youngest son. His performance recalls that of Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit and Shailene Woodley in The Descendants ... two of the best ever child performances.Be forewarned. This one is a true tearjerker ... especially if you are a parent or grandparent. Keeping in mind that it's the true story of one family's ordeal makes a few scenes almost impossible to watch clear-eyed. The film ends with a photo of the Belon family ... perfect.",7,4,6,5 January 2013
42," A Number on the Back
","Greetings again from the darkness. After some soul searching, I have decided to turn off the critical side of my brain and concentrate on what is good about this movie. As a baseball and movie fanatic, a bit of trepidation creeps in when the two come together. However, this really isn't a baseball movie, though the story focuses on what may be the most critical turning point in baseball history. In fact, this turning point was much bigger than the American Pasttime ... it was also key to the Civil Rights Movement. The movie is a reminder of how different things could have been with the wrong man rather than the right one ... Jackie Robinson.Writer/Director Brian Helgeland (s/p for L.A. Confidential and Mystic River) takes a look at what occurred in 1945-47, when Brooklyn Dodgers President and GM Branch Rickey (played by Harrison Ford) made the business decision to integrate baseball. We see his selection process ... Roy Campanella 'too nice', Satchel Paige 'too old'. He settles on Jackie Robinson after their infamous 3 hour meetings where Rickey confronts Robinson with his need for a black player 'with the guts NOT to fight back'.Chadwick Boseman portrays Jackie Robinson as a man thoroughly in love with his wife Rachel (played by Nicole Beharie), and one who says he just wants to 'be a ballplayer', while at the same time taking pride in his world-changing role. We see his evolution from his stint as shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs of Negro Leagues to his time with the Dodgers' AAA minor league team in Montreal and finally to his introduction to the Major Leagues in 1947.This is an earnest and sincere movie that removes the complexities of the times and the main characters. Much of it is portrayed as good guys versus bad guys. The good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. Alan Tudyk has the unenviable task of portraying Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who famously unleashed a verbal assault of vile racism on Robinson. Mr. Rickey credited Chapman's small-mindedness as the single biggest factor in unifying the Dodger team around Robinson. The other famous moment given time in the movie is when beloved shortstop Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) put his arm around Robinson, shushing the Cincinnati fans. Of course as a baseball fan, I enjoyed the all too brief antics of Brooklyn manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) whose place in the Robinson story would have been much more profound had he not succumbed to the weakness of the flesh (so to speak).Filmmaker Helgeland provides a tale of morality and social change, and provides a glimpse at the character and strength required by those involved. The story has much more to do with demonstrating how the times began to change than it does with how Jackie Robinson, an unpolished ballplayer but superior athlete, transformed himself into a perennial all-star and league MVP. And that's as it should be. As Rickey stated, acceptance will only occur if the world is convinced Robinson is a fine gentleman and a great baseball player. That burden must have weighed heavily at times, but it's very clear that Robinson was the right man at the right time.",7,73,85,13 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Ayyy, The Rum Too
","Greetings again from the darkness. Must admit that the first POTC was one my favorite films of 2003. Filled with action, humor and freshness, it brought a unique approach to the screen. Of course, sequels are always challenging and usually a let down. Although, I hesitate to call Dead Man's Chest a let down, it does lack the spontaneity and spark of the first. That said, it is still an extremely enjoyable movie-going experience and one not to be missed.Director Gore Verbinski returns with a bit darker, less tongue-in-cheek approach as Captain Jack Sparrow (the amazing Johnny Depp) searches for the key to regain his soul. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also return with a lame love story that luckily gets very little play after the first 15 minutes. The darker approach this time includes a fascinating pirate character named Davy Jones, who may be the most eye-catching creature ever captured on film. You simply can't take your eyes off of him! Jones is played by the totally unrecognizable Bill Nighy (who everyone remembers from 'Love Actually'). Watching Davy Jones play the organ is itself worth the price of admission.Also new to the cast is Stellan Skarsgard ('Good Will Hunting') as Bootstrap Bill, Bill Turner's (Bloom) lost soul father forever banished to serve Davy Jones. The scenes with Skarsgard and Bloom lacked the punch one would have expected. Actually most of the scenes with Bloom lack punch. Maybe we have grown a bit tired of his simple eye-batting method acting.Depp, of course, is the real star. His Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the more popular screen characters of all time. Kids and Adults love him. He is not quite wicked and not quite a good man. We can tell Depp has fun with the character, but it is easy to take his performance for granted the second time around. Try not to. It is a real pleasure to watch.Yes, the story is pretty weak and very little character development occurs. But that's not what this series is about, is it? The new sea creatures are remarkable (putting the first of the new round of 'Star Wars' to shame). This is a visual (not an intellectual feast), so enjoy it for what it is ... and try not to have tentacle nightmares afterwards.",7,2,7,8 July 2006
Argo," Best Bad Idea
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'Based on a true story' is always a bit unsettling to see at the beginning of a movie. There are so many degrees to truth, that we are never really sure how big the dosage might be. With this film, we get the inside track on the all-too-familiar Iranian hostage situation that began on November 4, 1979 and ended 444 days later with the release of 52 U.S. Embassy workers. The story within that story is the focus ... six escaped as the Embassy was being seized.The film begins with a Cliff's Note history lesson on the fall of the U.S. backed Shah of Iran and the assumption of power by Ayatollah Khomeini. The six who escaped were welcomed into the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (played with grace by Victor Garber). Of course, this had to be kept secret or a terrible situation could have taken a turn for the even-worse.This story really takes off when the CIA gets involved and drums up a scheme to extricate the six in hiding. Ben Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, the real life CIA Agent, who uses the international fascination with movies to create a plan that involves making a fake Star Wars rip-off with the help of award winning make-up artist John Chambers (Planet of the Apes) and a long-time and old school Hollywood producer named Lester Spiegel. These two inject the film with humor and positive energy as played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Their levity is much appreciated given the unrelenting tension delivered by the rest of the story.This is extraordinary filmmaking thanks to the script from Chris Terrio, realistic camera work from Rodrigo Prieto and top-notch directing by Ben Affleck ... yes, the same Ben Affleck who stars in the film. The team creates a period piece that has not just the look and feel of 1979-80, but some of the most gut-wrenching on screen tension since Three Days of the Condor or Munich. Many thrillers utilize car chases and gunfire. Here, we get personal tension thanks to politics and real life unknowns.The film is perfectly cast and strong support work is provided by Bryan Cranston as the CIA chief, Kyle Chandler as Hamilton Jordan, Bob Gunton as Cyrus Vance, as well as Chris Messina, Zeljko Ivanek, Richard Kind, Clea DuVall and Tate Donovan. There are also brief appearances by Philip Baker Hall, Adrienne Barbeau and the great Michael Parks.There are only two negatives to the film. First, Ben Affleck is miscast as Tony Mendez. The closing credits show what a perfect job they did in the rest of the cast, but to have a superhero looking American walking around Iran is certain to draw attention where it's not wanted. Plus, as director, Affleck suffers from Warren Beatty syndrome. He LOVES seeing his face on screen. The number of Alleck close-ups has to push 20. It's too much too often. Secondly, the final escape scene at the airport is just a bit too Hollywood and really stands out from the rest of the movie. There was no shortage of tension and the Armageddon style chase just looked cheesy.Those two things noted, this is Oscar material for sure. If you remember this era, the yellow ribbons and news clips featuring Cronkite, Koppel and Brokaw will bring back a frustrating time in U.S. history. If you are too young to remember, this acts as a reminder of just how powerful and quiet the CIA can be when it is doing its job properly.Don't miss the final credits as we hear Jimmy Carter narrate his memories as President, and we see real life photos of the six escapees.

Last Flag Flying," no need for the Shore Patrol
","Greetings again from the darkness. Apprehension and trepidation are the emotions that strike whenever anyone compares a movie to the classic 1973 Hal Ashby/ Jack Nicholson film THE LAST DETAIL. That holds true even if the novel the film is based on was written by the same author (Darryl Ponicson) who wrote 'The Last Detail' (1970), and even if the new film is directed by one of the finest directors working today – Richard Linklater. This latest doesn't play like a true sequel, but the reuniting of three men who served together in Vietnam does hammer home a couple of interesting statements while also delivering the type of dramedy that 2017 audiences tend to connect with.Larry 'Doc' Shepherd (Steve Carell), a former Navy medic, has had the type of year that no one deserves. It's 2003 and he has just been notified that his Marine son was killed in action while on duty in the war in Iraq. This comes only a few months after Doc lost his beloved wife to breast cancer. It's too much for him to handle on his own, so he embarks on a mission to ask his Vietnam buddies from three decades prior to accompany him to claim his son's body at Arlington National Cemetery. His two buddies are former Marines Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishbourne). Sal is a washed out dive bar owner and Mueller is now the Reverend at a small church. The three men share the burden of a war secret that each has tried to forget, and they begin what's basically a road trip movie of middle aged men bonding during what is the absolute low point in life for one of them. Simultaneously, it also seems like an opportunity for all three to rejoin the living.Lost idealism is the shared trait now among the three men, though their levels of cynicism vary. Edwin Starr sang it, and the characters in this movie openly question: War  What is it good for? Doc, Sal and Mueller have separated themselves from memories of war in three distinct ways – family, booze, and God. It's only by reconnecting with each other that they begin the long overdue process of reflection. TV's are tuned to the capture of Saddam Hussein from the spider-hole, and the similarities of the Vietnam and Iraq wars are contemplated. These are patriotic men who once trusted the government, but are now so disenchanted they ask 'what's the point?'Mr. Cranston has the showiest role, but it's Mr. Carell who shines as the still-in-shock father. J Quinton Johnson also excels as the young Marine charged with accompanying the gentlemen, and the best scene of the film features Cicely Tyson as the mother of a long ago fallen soldier who crossed paths with the three leads. As you might expect in a Linklater movie, the musical choices are unusual and spot on. Bob Dylan ('Not Dark Yet'), Neil Young ('Old Man'), Eminem ('Without Me'), and Levon Helm ('Wide River to Cross') are all included.The film is certainly an unusual blend of comedy, tragic drama, and contemporary political commentary. Unfortunately, the contrivances are too many and too frequent to allow the film and characters to breathe and achieve the greatness of a true message movie. It teases us with flashes us brilliance and then pokes us in the ribs with another goofy sidebar as if to say 'just kidding'. It seems this would have been better served as an intimate portrayal of these three aging men who were willing to die for their country than as a giant political anti-war statement and an accusation of how evil the government is. The ultimate message Linklater drills home: be a good friend, and be a good person. We can never have enough of those.",7,20,37,8 November 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Moonlight Serenade
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Gore Verbinski ('The Mexican' 'The Ring') finally delivers with this instant Disney classic.  Wonderful casting, crackling humor and terrific special effects make this one a gem. Johnny Depp is perfect as the strange, funny, smart, slightly off center pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow.  Geoffrey Rush is his equal as Sparrow's enemy Barbossa.  Brilliant casting with the up and coming stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly ('Bend it like Beckham') give this film very wide appeal to the mass audience - not an easy task for a swashbuckling pirate movie - ask Geena Davis and Renny Harlin.  Although some of the dialog is bit over the top, the basic story line is pretty interesting and actually works on a couple of levels.  This is fine movie making and a joy to watch and recommend.  Doubt the sequel will be as well done, but enjoy this one.",8,0,2,18 July 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," The Friends and Family Plan
","Greetings again from the darkness. There is always a bit of uncertainty when discussing or reviewing anything Star Trek related. So many rabid fans are more knowledgeable and keyed in to all the details. I am not. While I enjoyed the Gene Rodenberry TV series, and the subsequent movie versions, obsession never hit me. Because of this, my views will vary from those Trekkies and sci-fi experts.Director JJ Abrams re-invented the franchise in 2009 with stunning results. That 'new' Enterprise crew returns here: Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as Bones, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty. The new addition is Alice Eve as Carol, daughter of Admiral Marcus (played by RoboCop Peter Weller). Abrams is wise enough to know that this story needed a great villain so he revisits Khan and casts a spectacular Benedict Cumberbatch (the sleazy dude from Atonement).This movie works because of the crew's chemistry. We believe they like and respect each other ... even while breaking orders. The film works even better thanks to a villain that establishes a believable threat. Cumberbatch plays a super-human force with a mixture of Shakespeare and Hannibal Lecter. He delivers lines in a way that you have no cause to doubt his intent. This is a nice contrast to the warm fuzzies coming from the crew members.It can't go without mention that there is a shocking display of crystal blue eyes on display. Chris Pine, Peter Weller, Benedict Cumberbatch and Alice Eve all flash baby blues that jump off the screen in 3D. The only reason the sea blue peepers weren't more distracting is because of what I refer to as FXOD ... a special effects overdose. It seems as though each summer blockbuster feels the obligation to go bigger on the visual effects to get noticed. As often happens, the effects are just too much. Luckily, the characters and story are strong enough that it stayed on track.If you are a casual Star Trek fan, this is one that will entertain you. If you are a Trekkie, you have no doubt already seen it twice and have blogged about all the errors. Next up: 2016 for the third entry in the Abrams franchise.",7,1,5,31 May 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Ray Harryhausen 40 years later
","Greetings again from the darkness. How wonderful to see a family action/adventure that makes sense to those of us who have not contributed to J.K. Rowling's enormous fortune. Director Andrew Adamson (of 'Shrek' and 'Shrek 2' fame) brings to life the enormously popular stories of C.S. Lewis. 'Narnia' is a thrilling ride with a story, a message and some amazing characters and action.From a technical standpoint the battle scene challenges most anything accomplished in the 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Harry Potter' movies. The effects make me believe this is what legendary effects specialist Ray Harryhausen envisioned as he worked his magic in the 'Sinbad' movies and later in 'Clash of the Titans'.Lewis did little to hide the biblical allegory, going as far as calling the 4 children of the prophecy the children of Adam. Good versus evil, sacrifice for the good of others and the confused doubter all play a part in the story. It is, however, initially a bit off-setting to experience talking beavers and wolves and a sly, deceitful fox. The impact is that we care very much for the characters and their desire and reluctance to do the right (and courageous) things.The four children are all pretty much unknown to American audiences and newcomer Georgie Henley is marvelous as bright-eyed Lucy Pevensie. She is the heart of the film and of the family. Tilda Swinton is perfect as the White Witch. She is a real life Cruella Deville on steroids. She has the icy stare and cut features that Adamson's first choice Michelle Pfeiffer lacks. We really dislike her ... and that's a good thing!! Liam Neeson was brought in to replace Brian Cox as the voice of the majestic Aslan, and a better choice is difficult to imagine. Other voices that stand out are Dawn French and Ray Winstone as Mrs. and Mr. Beaver and Rupert Everett as the fox.Parents be warned that the battle scene is very intense and some of the visuals will frighten the youngest viewers. On the bright side, most adults will enjoy the film every bit as much as the kids in the audience. Now will someone please figure out a way to make C.S. Lewis' 'The Screwtape Letters' into a film?",8,10,18,10 December 2005
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Creme Brulee or a Divorce?
","Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.The intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.After moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.The polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood - these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that's just the stuff I can tell you! Cal's first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual, Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton, but it's interesting to note (in real life) she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).All of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey). Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that, it's on to the new Spider-Man for her.Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman, who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.No question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men will relate to what's going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie.",7,71,98,31 July 2011
Public Enemies," Bye, Bye Blackbird
","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on Bryan Burrough's book, 'Heat' director surprisingly takes a straight-on approach to the story of Public Enemy Number One, John Dillinger. There is none of Mann's usual MTV approach, though some of the texture and look of the film seemed inconsistent and even distracting.Personally I appreciate the mostly no-frills method here as Johnny Depp brings Dillinger to life as a serious, dangerous man when he's working, and a bit of a charmer when dealing with the press or the ladies. The sets, costumes, accents and cast are all spot on. I especially enjoyed the look and feel of the train station and the Biograph Theatre.If anything, too many characters are thrown at us, but the cast is so strong, that even that is no real negative. Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd, Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette and Stephen Lang as Agent Winsted all add a nice touch. And don't miss Diana Krall (Mrs. Elvis Costello) as a lounge singer. Christian Bale actually plays Melvin Purvis close to the vest and some of the best stuff is thrown down by Billy Crudup in a wonderful spin on the ambitious J Edgar Hoover. He is excellent and creepy.Depp and Cotillard have some strong scenes together, but I actually thought the gun fights were a bit over done and unrealistic - though efforts were taken to make it seem very real. Just a slight disconnect there for me.Overall a pretty decent and straightforward bio-pic with minimal Hollywood fluff. Dillinger's story is plenty strong enough without the dramatic license we usually get. Also loved the soundtrack.",7,2,3,2 July 2009
The Babadook," You can't get rid of The Babadook
","Greetings again from the darkness. There is nothing more frightening than the thoughts that occur within the recesses of our own mind. And therein lies the problem with so many 'horror' movies. We may squirm and cover our eyes while watching the latest slasher film, but to stick with us as real horror, a film must tap into those internal, psychological fears that we each carry. This first feature film from writer/director Jennifer Kent does that so effectively that I am hesitant to write much more than  go see this one (but of course, I will).Ms. Kent has fully developed her award winning short film Monster from 2005. With a limited budget of around $2 million, she has figured out a way to utilize many horror staples: a misfit child, the family dog, an old house with creaky floors and doors, a musty basement, old reliables like under the bed and in the closet, open windows, and the always effective knocks on the door. Combine these touches with an incredibly creepy and dramatically graphically illustrated children's book, and terrific characters in the mom and her young son, and all the elements are in place for a suspenseful and terrifying film that is a throwback to the good old days.It's easy to spot the influences of such classics as William Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973), Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), and Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), but Ms. Kent has her own style with the camera and expertly creates an atmosphere of widely disparate mood swings grounded in believable characters. Essie Davis (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) delivers an extraordinary performance as Amelia, whose husband died en route to the hospital as she gave birth to their son. Noah Wiseman plays Samuel, the now 7 year old boy who has behavioral issues, fears the monster under his bed, and recognizes the resentment his mom feels towards him as a constant reminder of the death that occurred on the day of his birth. Wiseman looks like a cross between Elijah Wood in Witness and Danny in The Shining  only he is much more energetic and animated than either of those characters.The suspense builds as Amelia's lack of sleep progressively wears her down, as her job and parenting responsibilities rob her of any down time or relaxation. She can't even get through a solo release in bed without her frightened son barging in for security. The dynamic between mother, son and dead husband/father elevate this to a level of psychological thrills that we don't often get on screen. There are so many superb moments to 'enjoy'. The amount of blood present is minimal, especially in comparison to modern day slashers. It's much more about how grief and stress can affect us in sinister ways. In addition to the influences already listed, there is also a tip of the cap to pioneer Georges Mêlées and his use of magic in the early days of film. Babadook may be an anagram for 'a bad book', but it's also now synonymous with a really good horror movie!",8,8,19,7 December 2014
Us," Peele is 2 for 2
","Greetings again from the darkness. Jordan Peele first got noticed on 'MADtv,' and then for his impersonation of Barack Obama. His career got a boost with 'Key and Peele' with Keegan-Michael Key, and then it simply exploded in 2018 with GET OUT. For that film, he won his first Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and was also nominated for Best Director (his directorial debut) and for Best Picture (as a Producer). With his follow-up to that breakout film, Mr. Peele has squashed any talk of being a one-hit wonder, and has actually elevated his work with this latest.The film opens in 1986 as a family is on vacation at Santa Cruz, California. While taking in the amusement park along the boardwalk, their young daughter Adelaide wanders off into a house of mirrors where she comes face to face with her doppelgänger - her exact lookalike. It's the film's first creepy moment, but certainly not the last. The story then jumps forward to present day where Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o, Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), her husband Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke, BLACK PANTHER), and their teenage daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and young son Jason (Evan Alex) are on a getaway to a lake house ... one located near their friends Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss), and their in sync twin daughters (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). Adelaide is not thrilled when husband Gabe suggests they head over to Santa Cruz beach.Part of the brilliance of the film is that it works as a straight-forward horror film with some very funny moments (often thanks to Mr. Duke), but its real purpose is to inspire multiple theories along with the corresponding debate. Alternate meanings, metaphors and clues are dropped in most every scene. A toy ambulance, a JAWS shirt, a 'Thriller' shirt, a TV commercial for the 'Hands Across America' event, and the corresponding VHS tapes next to the family TV only hint at the numerous nods Peele serves up to other films, especially some horror classics. You'll note the director chooses an aerial shot not dissimilar to that of Kubrick's THE SHINING as the family drives towards their vacation spot. Also present (in a couple of scenes) is the reference to bible verse Jeremiah 11:11, and sharp-eyed viewers will spot other references to the double 11.While the Wilson and Tyler families are visiting on the sandy beach, young Jason wanders off sending mother Adelaide into a near-frenzy with recollections of her night on that same beach so many years ago. Later that evening, the true horror begins. A terrific shot of 4 figures all clad in red at the end of the Wilson's driveway kicks the film into high gear. More doppelgangers appear and lead us to a subterranean community living in tunnels, and sharing the space with bunnies. We learn of 'the tethered'; those who are (mostly) identical to those living above. Those of identical likeness square off in the ongoing battle for survival, and that's really all you should know before seeing for yourself.The cast is terrific, especially Ms. Nyong'o, who like the other actors seems to relish playing the dual roles. She also nails the final shot with a smile that will chill you to the marrow. Madison Curry makes a strong impression as young Adelaide, and as much fun as we have with the characters, the true joy lies in trying to 'catch' all that filmmaker Peele throws at us. That final wall of folks in red is pretty easy to decipher, but some of the little clues and prods require a second viewing. It's fascinating and historic that Jordan Peele's follow up movie could possibly make this yet another horror movie contending at Oscar time. If you are up for a fun little horror movie that's also a mind-bending societal commentary on those who are born into privilege and those who aren't, then Mr. Peele has just the flick for you.",8,4,12,2 April 2019
The Danish Girl," He said/She said
","Greetings again from the darkness. There was a time when movies were cultural trendsetters in such areas as speech, style and behavior. Somewhere along the way, a transition occurred, and these days movies are more a reflection of the times – showing us who we are and focusing mostly on what society focuses on. Oscar winning director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) capitalizes on the current movement to mainstream the LGBT community by telling the story of Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe, a transgender from more than 40 years before Dr. Renee Richards, and 75 years before Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner.Lucida Coxon has adapted the 2000 novel from David Ebershoff, which is a fictionalized version of the 1933 'Man Into Woman'  the personal letters and diaries of Einar/Lili (edited by Niels Hoyer). The film opens in 1926 Copenhagen as successful landscape artist Einar Wegener and his struggling-to-gain-respect portrait artist wife Gerda appear to be happily married and quite attracted to each other. During this segment, Hooper and cinematographer Danny Cohen utilize a somewhat distracting quasi-fisheye lens that distorts most every shot  presumably making the point that this couple's life is itself distorted. There is no shortage of foreshadowing despite the bohemian artist lifestyle. Einar doesn't miss a chance to caress the silks and frills as he visits his ballet dancing friend Ulla (Amber Heard), and things escalate quickly once he poses in stockings for one of Gerda's portraits.The best and most interesting segment of the film is the middle as Einar begins to explore his Lili persona, and Gerda is diligent in her support  going as far as to encourage her husband to attend a party as Lili (introduced as Einar's visiting cousin). The public interactions with their friends and acquaintances are a little difficult to accept, though the scenes with her initial male suitor Henrik (Ben Whishaw) make it clear this is a point of no return. Despite this, the times are such that Einar willingly attempts to repress the Lili side, and even visits multiple medical and psychological specialists. It's this segment that reminds us how quickly the medical profession of the era overreacted by prescribing radiation, electrotherapy, and even by institutionalizing those who were so inclined.Gerda and Einar/Lili 'escape' to Paris, where it becomes obvious that it's Lily who has been masquerading as Einar, rather than the other way. The duality of Einar/Lily soon dissolves and daily life is filled with lessons  such as a Paris peep show where hand and body movements become part of the transition. Eddie Redmayne (last year's Oscar winner for The Theory of Everything) gives an extraordinary performance, and is at his best when exploring the subtle nuances of Lili. It's crucial to note that while Redmayne's performance is a physical marvel, it's Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair, Ex Machina) as Gerda who provides the real heart and soul of the story. Though the film glosses over some traits of the real life Gerda, Ms. Vikander is stunning in more than a few scenes, which in the hands of a lesser actress, could have proved cringe-inducing.Adding some depth in limited roles are Matthias Schoenaerts (Rust and Bone) as Hans, Einar's childhood friend all grown up, and Sebastian Koch (The Lives of Others) as the pioneering doctor who performs the sex reassignment surgeries that physically transition Einar into Lili. Even with the strong supporting cast, there is no mistaking this as anything other than a film that belongs to Mr. Redmayne and Ms. Vikander.Director Hooper takes a very conventional approach to an unconventional story, and this 'safe' direction seems designed to make the uncomfortable story more palatable for mainstream audiences (similar to how Brokeback Mountain handled homosexuality). However, don't mistake this for Tootsie or Mrs. Doubtfire. There are two serious stories here: the struggles of one person's identity, and the corresponding challenges of a married couple. Hooper's style is by no means cutting edge, but does feature one of the best lines of the year  'I've only liked a handful of people in my life, and you've been two of them.' This story has bounced around the movie world for awhile, and for many years was rumored to have Nicole Kidman in the Einar/Lili role. Your imagination can determine if that would have made for a better fit.",6,6,17,16 December 2015
Ted," Tigers play too rough, but not as rough as Ted
","Greetings again from the darkness. Upon watching the trailer, it would be easy and understandable to simply write off this movie as a ridiculous piece of junk produced merely to capitalize on the popularity of Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy creator). That would be a mistake. While much of what Ted has to say will burn your ears, the insight that goes into his lines is often unmistakeably brilliant.The movie opens with terrific narration from Patrick Stewart. It's done in A Christmas Story style, only with a caustic and deadpan irreverence that will jolt you before the opening credits have even rolled. We learn the story of 9 year old John Bennett, a social outcast who receives a teddy bear for Christmas. First, what parent buys their 9 year old a teddy bear??? Anyway, that night, under the covers, young John wishes that he and Ted could be lifelong friends. In the morning, he awakes to find a sweet, lively teddy who startles everyone.The talking bear becomes an instant celebrity and is even booked on the Johnny Carson show ... the first of many 1980's pop culture references. As in the case of Corey Feldman (pointed out by the narrator), celebrity often fades. Flash forward 25 years and John and Ted are living together with John's girlfriend (Mila Kunis). The boys spend most of their time smoking pot and watching TV re-runs and worshiping the 1980 Flash Gordon cult movie. It's a typical man-child existence except that one of them is a vile, 4 letter-word spewing teddy bear, and there is no logical reason that the beautiful Kunis hasn't walked away from the four year relationship with the hapless loser John.Mr. MacFarlane's true talent lies in laughing at our societal norms and encouraging us to laugh at ourselves. He does this through Stewie, the pet dog on Family Guy, and now here with a talking teddy bear. He holds little back in ripping our obsession with celebrity or our clinical anxiety towards all things Politically Correct. Luckily the same rules don't apply for talking teddies, so we hear things that we aren't even allowed to think. Because he can, MacFarlane mixes in his love of the 80's with numerous references and we even get odd cameos from Tom Skerritt, Nora Jones and Ryan Reynolds. The most bizarre reference takes up a substantial part of the movie ... Sam Jones, the star of Flash Gordon, appears as an aged party animal, teaching the boys some new tricks. Most of this will be dead time to those unfamiliar with the 1980 movie ... and evidently none of us have been impacted by it like MacFarlane.The movie is a mash-up of John Waters, Bad Santa, Jackass and just about every stereotypical slacker-buddy movie from the past 25 years. It's all of that and none of that at the same time. Depending on your viewpoint, Ted is either a crass, irreverent, totally inappropriate waste of movie time, or it's a comical, insightful observation on where we are as a society right now. Only you can decide ... just please don't take your kids.",6,1,7,1 July 2012
Knives Out," wheel of knives
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'I suspect 'fow-uhl' play.' So states the renowned and poetically named private detective, Benoit Blanc. Of course when mega-wealthy, best-selling author Harlan Thrombey supposedly commits suicide after his 85th birthday party by slashing his own throat with a knife, something more sinister (you know, like ... murder) must be considered. The violin playing over the opening shots of the palatial Thrombey manor teases us with thoughts of most any year from the past 75. These nostalgic thoughts fade quickly as we begin to meet the players.Detective Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (a quite funny Noah Segan) seem merely to be crossing their T's in the suicide investigation as they dutifully meet with each family member for a statement. It's this progression of questioning that introduces us to the year's most colorful ensemble cast. Patriarch Thrombey's (Christopher Plummer) scheming heirs-in-waiting include: his daughter Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), happy to remind you of her success as a self-made businessperson; Linda's smarmy husband Richard (Don Johnson); their renegade son Ransom (Chris Evans) who arrives a bit later; Harlan's son Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon) who 'runs' the family publishing business; Harlan's ex-daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette), a self-help guru who has a secret side gig; grandkids Meg (Katherine Langford), preppy social media troll Jacob (Jaeden Martell), and Donna (Riki Lindhome of 'Garfunkel and Oates'); and Harlan's mother Greatnana (Dallas' own K Callan). Two key non-family members are the housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) who finds Harlan's body, and nurse Marta (Ana de Armas), Harlan's friend and only real confidante.Writer-director Rian Johnson has put together a diverse career with such films as indie breakout BRICK (2005), science fiction hit LOOPER (2012) and of course, STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII - THE LAST JEDI (2018). With this latest, he shows a real flair with a rare comedic whodunit, and manages to perfectly execute his twisted script of twisted personalities. Think of this as Agatha Christie meets CLUE via THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. The overall mangled morality of this entitled family becomes crystal clear as we get to know each. Johnson presents many familiar elements for fans of the mystery genre (the dark mansion, the creepy line-up of hangers-on, the red-herring clues and missteps), and most impressively, he blends those with many creative and surprising moments ... some that will have you believing you have it figured out. But even if you do, the long and winding road is an utter blast.Even with that deep and talented cast, it's Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas as Marta who stand out. They have the most screen time and neither waste a moment. Mr. Craig's purposefully comedic southern drawl completes the film's most memorable character, in fact, one of the year's most memorable characters. Ms. de Armas finally finds a role to take advantage of her skill. Nurse Marta has a lie-detecting reflux gag that is not just valuable to the case, but also vital to the loudest audience reaction during the film. Mr. Craig and Ms. de Armas will also appear together in the upcoming Bond film NO TIME TO DIE.During the reading of the will, director Johnson brings in STAR WARS stalwart Frank Oz (best known as Yoda) to play the family attorney, while another scene features one of the all-time great character actors (and Roger Ebert favorite) M. Emmet Walsh (BLOOD SIMPLE). Mr. Johnson also offers a unique spin on classism and the 1%, including a running gag about Marta's nation of origin.Johnson's regular team is in top form here: Cinematographer Steve Yedlin, Film Editor Bob Ducsay, and composer Nathan Johnson (Rian's cousin). Another deserving of mention is Costume Designer Jenny Eagan, who matches threads with personality about as effectively as we've seen, and Production Designer David Crank who creates the ideal mansion of secrets. This film is wickedly clever and barrels of fun. There may not have been a more purely entertaining movie this year ... and it's been a terrific year for movies. Just remember: 'My house. My rules. My coffee.'",8,6,21,26 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," Spidey 2 Good
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Everyone's complaints on the first were pretty much the same.  Weak special effects and poor character development left us with a bit of a hollow feeling.  This sequel is far superior on both fronts. Tobey Maguire has made Peter Parker/Spiderman HIS role.  His turn as Parker is more impressive than that of the masked hero.  Dr. Ock played by the surprisingly cast (always excellent)Alfred Molina is a terrific villain and this is where the special effects really shine.  The only real weakness in this one was the strength of the first: Kirstin Dunst just doesn't bring her usual sparkle.  As a matter of fact, she looks a tad under the weather in most scenes with her bad hair and bad make-up.  I have often said she could be the next Julia Roberts, but this one is a step in the wrong direction.  Of course, we have the mile wide opening for the next sequel and it will be interesting to see if all the key players re-sign.  This is one not to be missed if you want to see a comic hero done right.",7,0,2,18 July 2004
The Secret in Their Eyes," Eyes with Passion
","Greetings again from the darkness. I was a bit miffed when this film beat out both A Prophet and The White Ribbon for the Best Foreign Language Film at this year's Academy Awards. Since then, I have been anxious to see this 'upset' winner. It is with great pleasure that I state my faith in the Academy voters is restored. This is a staggeringly wonderful film! Based on the novel by Eduardo Sachesi, it is written and directed by Juan Jose Campanella, who also directed Argentina's 2001 Oscar entry 'Son of the Bride'. Mr. Campanella also has quite a resume of U.S. television in addition to his film work. What really stands out here is the multitude of story lines and character development, none of which are cheated ... yet each which could have stood on their own as a film. This is terrific film-making with rare balance between comedic dialogue, a full fledged crime drama, unrequited love and nasty politics.The excellent script is helped along with fine acting by the key players: Ricardo Darin as Esposito, Soledad Villamil as Irene, Guillermo Francella as Sandoval, Pablo Rago as Morales, and Javier Godino as Gomez. Each actor has physical features that play well with the film's title.I certainly don't wish to give away much of the substance of the film, but it mostly revolves around the investigation by Esposito and Sandoval into the brutal rape and murder of Morales' young, beautiful wife. Esposito works for Irene and they have 'eyes' for each other, and Gomez is the key suspect despite all the political maneuvering designed to throw the investigators off track.There are a few outstanding scenes and my two favorite were an incredibly intense elevator ride, and a fascinating crowd scene at a soccer/futbol game. As you might guess, there are innumerable close-ups for a clear eye-level shot and the film bounces back and forth between 1974 and 2000, so we must adjust to the weak make-up.For anyone who enjoys fine film-making and isn't afraid of 2 plus hours of subtitles, you will surely be satisfied and impressed at the quality of this film.",8,3,5,29 May 2010
The Irishman," a holiday gift for cinephiles
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Copacabana tracking shot in GOODFELLAS in etched not only in my brain, but in cinema lore. Filmmaker Martin Scorsese teases us with a similar shot as the opening sequence in his latest. The camera snakes through the dank halls and rooms of an assisted-living center before settling on the well-worn face of wheelchair-bound octogenarian Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro). Mr. Sheeran is the titular Irishman, and he narrates the story of his life, at least as he recalls it. His is a life story that connects the mob to history and politics in a no frills manner surely to provoke thought, skepticism, and a knot in the tummy.Oscar winning writer Steve Zaillian (SCHINDLER'S LIST, also GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN) adapted Charles Brandt's book 'I Heard You Paint Houses' for the film. Mr. Brandt was Sheeran's attorney and worked with Sheeran on his memoir. The book title is highlighted by Scorsese at both the beginning and end of the film, as well as through a line of dialogue in the first phone conversation between Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Mr. Sheeran was a WWII veteran turned truck driver turned mob hit man (and good soldier). He tells his story with little fanfare and in a way that we understand no glamour is associated with this lifestyle.For those looking for the next GOODFELLAS or CASINO, you'll likely be disappointed. This one is not as flashy or stylish as those two classics, and instead is a 3 and a half hour introspective look at the men who are efficiency experts in power. Violence is merely one of the tools in their box. The presentation is contemplative, not action-centric. The hits are abrupt and jerky and realistic, not the stylistic choreography of shootouts in films like JOHN WICK. There is a skewed theme of friendship and male bonding ... even mentorship. It's unlike what we've seen before from mob movies.After a chance meeting over a timing belt on a delivery truck, Sheeran is taken under the wing of Philadelphia mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). This is Pesci's first onscreen appearance since 2010, and he is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of 'the quiet Don.' His performance is 180 degrees from his comedy in LETHAL WEAPON (2.3.4) or HOME ALONE, and 180 degrees the opposite direction from his roles in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, where he was a bombastic man (not a clown) on the edge of violence at all times. Mr. Pesci has spent the last decade playing jazz under the name Joe Doggs. It's such a joy to have him back on screen, especially as the father figure-friend-ruthless businessman. His Russell is always calm and calculating, whether plotting the next kill or putting up with his wife's frequent smoke breaks on a road trip.It's Russell who directs Sheeran to connect with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Pacino flashes his blustery best as Hoffa in a couple of scenes, but is also terrific while spewing one of his countless 'c***suckers', or savoring one of his beloved ice cream sundaes - a simple pleasure in a complicated life. Sheeran and Hoffa develop an unusual friendship in their many years together, and Hoffa's real life unsolved disappearance in 1975 is the basis for Sheeran's recollections.We learn that Sheeran's time in WWII taught him to kill ... there is a scene involving POW's digging their own grave while his rifle is pointed at them. In fact, most of the story is told in flashbacks that bounce between different eras. Scorsese, as has been reported ad nauseam, has utilized the de-aging process from Industrial Light & Magic to show DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino and others over the years. The effect is a bit distracting at first, but the story and these characters are so intriguing that we simply roll with after the initial jolt. It's also obvious how Scorsese worked to make DeNiro look like the hulking presence Sheeran was in real life (think Tom Cruise in the Jack Reacher movies). Camera angles, should pads, and shoe lifts are used to make us think DeNiro towers over the others the way Sheeran really did. DeNiro is excellent in portraying Sheeran as a good soldier, reserved in mannerisms - even flashing a slight stutter at times. He's a proud man who simply looks at the mob work as his job.In addition to the three stars who each excel in their roles, Scorsese has assembled a huge and talented cast. Harvey Keitel is chilling in a couple of scenes as Angelo Bruno, Ray Romano plays mob lawyer Bill Bufalino, Bobby Cannavale is steak-loving Skinny Razor, Jesse Plemons is Hoffa's adopted son Chuckie O'Brien, Domenick Lombardozzi is Fat Tony Salerno, comedian Sebastian Maniscalco is 'Crazy Joe' Gallo, Louis Cancelmi is bespectacled Sally Bugs, Jack Huston plays Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, and even Steven Van Zandt plays crooner Jerry Vale.You are probably wondering, 'Where are the women?'. While there is no Lorraine Bracco (GOODFELLAS) or Sharon Stone (CASINO), Scorsese makes the point that with Sheeran, and these other mobsters, it's all business and real family relationships are non-existent. Stephanie Kurtzuba plays Irene Sheeran (Frank's second wife) and Katherine Narducci is Carrie Bufalino (Russell's cig-loving wife). They have some brief but entertaining moments on the road trip, and Marin Ireland has an effective scene late in the movie as Carrie, one of Frank's daughters, while Welker White plays Jo Hoffa. But it's Sheeran's daughter Peggy who is the quiet moral center of the story and his life. Played as a youngster by Lucy Gallina and later by Anna Paquin, Peggy is a mostly silent observer of her father, and whatever conscience he has, is impacted by her glances. Ms. Paquin is especially good with one question ... 'Why?'Worthy of special mention is Stephen Graham who plays Anthony 'Tony Pro' Provenzano, a friend-turned-rival of Hoffa. Graham and Pacino share two standout scenes - one in prison, while Hoffa scoops his sundae, and a later meeting where Hoffa takes offense to Tony Pro's late arrival and attire. Both scenes are remarkable in that there is underlying humor balancing the surface anger. In fact, the film is filled with memorable scenes. Hoffa's guidance on self-defense in guns vs. knives, and most every scene between DeNiro's Sheeran and Pesci's Russell. DeNiro and Pesci have a chemistry few actors share. It dates back to RAGING BULL (1980), and I believe this is their 7th film together.The film reminds me of the 1970's movies that fueled my movie obsession: THE GODFATHER I and II, THE CONVERSATION, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, CHINATOWN, and even THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Sheeran may or may not be a reliable narrator, but these are real people - even if we don't know the specifics on every hit. Captions are periodically included to inform of us how a particular mobster met his maker - again providing some dark humor. What is a bit surprising is the male bonding, even friendship, between guys in such a brutal profession. And watching how the story weaves in and out of history with the Bay of Pigs, Cuba casinos, and the Kennedy assassination -'If they can whack a President ...' is a bit unsettling.Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (SILENCE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) is a good fit for Scorsese's vision, and you can catch the varying camera styles for each character - and don't miss the stunning shot of the illicit guns in the river. Composer Robbie Robertson (The Band) delivers Scorsese trademark musical riffs, and 3-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmacker is in peak form editing this epic. This is the 8th film collaboration for Scorsese and DeNiro, but the first in 25 years (CASINO).I'm a little concerned. In fact, I'm a little more than concerned. This feels like the end of an era. It's not the end of Scorsese films, but it's the final chapter of his mob films. No other filmmaker comes close in this genre. With the bookends of Sheeran reminiscing in the assisted-living home, this is quite the holiday gift for cinephiles ... and a last one (providing Netflix survives).",9,10,21,1 December 2019
Black Book," Garbo Got it in the End
","Greetings again from the darkness. Just a wonderful film with enormous amounts of energy, suspense and intrigue. Director Paul Verhoeven has had his career ups and downs - 'Basic Instinct', 'RoboCop', 'Showgirls' - but here he is at his absolute best in creating tension in so many scenes.The script is brilliant (supposedly based on actual events) and takes us on a wild ride and proof again that power is dangerous, causes strange bedfellows and most of all, breeds distrust ... even amongst those on the same side.Set at the end of WWII, the film feels real and the sets and props are outstanding. Even the violence and scenes of torture are painful to watch. Carice van Houten is brilliant as Rachel/Ellis, the Dutch lady who joins the resistance in order to seek revenge on those responsible for her family's brutal massacre. Ms. van Houten has a real spirit and fully captures the intricacies of the role. Sebastian Koch (Muntze) and Thom Hoffman (Akkermans) are both excellent ... the latter reminds of the intensity of the 'old' Russell Crowe.It is a rare film that combines an emotional roller coaster with a spy thriller. 'Black Book' succeeds on many levels and is truly superb film-making.",8,6,9,28 April 2007
127 Hours," Between a Rock and the Other Place
","Greetings again from the darkness. Spoilers are strictly avoided in my comments on movies. I completely understand that not everyone rushes out to see new releases the way that I do. For this movie, there can be no spoilers. We are all painfully aware of the real life ordeal suffered by Aron Ralston in 2003. This taut film succeeds at bringing to life the visuals our minds can only imagine.Danny Boyle is a terrific director and has three (now four) outstanding and diverse movies to his name (Slumdog Millionaire, Millions, Trainspotting). Here he re-teams with Slumdog writer Simon Beaufoy to bring us the screen version of Aron Ralston's book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place'. It's the story of an adventurous young man who is forced to take drastic measures when his arm is pinned after a fall while rock climbing.What the film really explores is Ralston's personality. A cocky, adventurous, fun-loving guy whose 'oops' moment consisted of not telling anyone where he was headed. A cardinal sin for hikers. Five days later he stumbles back to life, minus one arm. Ralston faces one of those moments when he must decide just how important life is. He must be a courageous man because his choice leads to life ... through excruciating pain.Boyle does an amazing job in capturing the moment and the setting. In what could be a hopeless situation, Ralston clings to life. James Franco delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Ralston. His range here is remarkable. Watching his hallucinations, flashbacks and persistence makes this an extremely watchable film despite the topic.Support work is minimal but decent from Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, Treat Williams, Kate Burton and Clemence Poesy. Franco and Boyle are the real stars as they capture Ralston's spirit. As a viewer, this taps into our inner most fear. What if this were us? What if we were him? Could we do it? Would we do it?",7,0,2,18 November 2010
Pirate Radio," A Boat of Honey
","Greetings again from the darkness. A rollicking good time with a bunch of music loving rebels, this film is mostly fiction, yet provides a nice glimpse into the mid-1960's British Rock music scene. Don't expect Citizen Kane and you won't be disappointed.Philip Seymour Hoffman (as The Count) leads the band of merry rock DJ's as they skirt the law and broadcast from sea onboard and trashed out ship owned by by the fabulous Bill Nighy. This troupe includes the likes of (proud and chubby) Nick Frost and Rhys Darby (from Flight of the Conchords). However, when DJ legend Gavin (in a flamboyant role by Rhys Ifans) steps on the ship, it goes to an entirely new level of wackiness.Being a true devotee of this period of music, I do wish a bit more attention had been paid to struggles to achieve acceptance ... rather than the odd personalities and sexual hijinks of the group, but with more than 60 songs touched, it is difficult to complain.Lest I forget, January Jones and Emma Thompson have brief, yet significant roles in the human side of the story. Still, the real star here is the music. Writer/Director Richard Curtis does a wonderful thing with some of the clips of British youths stealing a few moments with their radio. The faces often just show a look of total bliss. And that perfectly captures the magic of music - how it just captures our spirit and allows us to escape.Fast approaching 50 years now, in the words of the great Neil Young, Rock and Roll will never die.",7,6,10,15 November 2009
"I Love You, Man"," Lucky Leprechaun
","Greetings again from the darkness. Directed by John Hamburg (Along Came Polly) and starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segal, there really isn't much doubt what type of comedy we are in for. What I like about this one is the twist on the old comedy rule that the humor must come from the guy's struggle to understand women. Here it is regular guy Paul Rudd struggling in the male bonding department ... actually he has no male friends.While seemingly the perfect boyfriend and prize catch for Rashida Jones (real life daughter of Quincy Jones and Julie Lipton), Mr Rudd has no one to be his best man. The real fun begins when carefree Jason Segal shows up at Realtor Rudd's open house ... the listing is Lou Ferrigno's mansion - replete with Hulk statue in the backyard. Rudd and Segal commence to bonding at the man-cave while belting out songs from supergroup Rush.Rashida Jones is the typical girl who spews all secrets to her friends, one of which is played by Jaime Pressly, whose awfully loud marriage to jerk Jon Favreau provides some ongoing side humor. Predictably, Rudd and Segal's bonding begins to drive a wedge between Rudd and Rashida, which of course leads to the real awakening in their relationship. No matter ... the jokes are funny and situations are real and believable, which generates most of the laughter. Funny stuff ... with harsh language. Gotta give any movie a chance when it features 1970's icons like Ferrigno and Rush.",7,2,6,22 March 2009
Creed," A familiar and welcome mix of nostalgia and contemporary
","Greetings again from the darkness. Tis the season for the revival of two extremely successful and popular film franchises, each nearly 40 years old. Both stay true to their roots. For Star Wars that means big budget and ground-breaking special effects, while for Rocky, that means a personal mission and Sly. Writer/director Ryan Coogler and his Fruitvale Station (2013) star Michael B Jordan unite with the Italian Stallion himself, Sylvester Stallone, to add another chapter to a story we all thought concluded with Rocky Balboa (2006).Thirteen year old Adonis Johnson is an angry boy who doesn't shy away from fights. While being held in a juvenile detention center, he is visited by a woman named Mary Ann (Phylicia Rashad); she adopts him and fills in the gaps of his family tree. Adonis is the illegitimate son fathered by Apollo Creed, the champion boxer who died during Rocky IV. Mary Ann is Apollo's widow and she plops Adonis into her world of affluence, and sets him up for a career in finance. Of course, thanks to YouTube, Adonis studies his dad's old fights and promptly sneaks off to Tijuana to test out his own boxing skills.It's a foregone conclusion that Adonis will persuade his father's old adversary/friend to train and mentor him, and just like that, the owner of Adrian's Restaurant slips into a similar role made famous by Burgess Meredith. That's right; Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) becomes the Mickey to Adonis  right down to the (slower) chickens. Sure, it's a bit formulaic, but that's the idea behind a franchise. We have a history with Rocky, and know that he is basically a sweet guy who thrives on competition. Here, he has to tame a wild, self-trained young boxer who is connected to him through history.The film does so many things right that it's easy to forgive the missteps. Adonis' love interest is a young singer named Bianca (Tessa Thompson), who easily could have had a more substantive role in the story – in fact, it's a bit disappointing when she disappears for long segments. Also, there is a medical/health sub-plot that comes across a bit contrived and serves only the purpose of putting Stallone's role on more equal footing with Jordan's. Minor qualms, but annoyances just the same.What the film does right is create a terrific synergy between Rocky and Adonis. It's a bond both men need, though for different reasons. Stallone is so good as the aging Rocky that it's reason to forgive and forget his many cinematic foibles over the years. Also, the boxing cinematography from Maryse Alberti (The Wrestler, 2008) is stunning  especially her extended long take in the ring during Adonis' first professional fight. For the final fight, Adonis dons a special pair of trunks and takes on the nasty, thunderous punches of 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (played by boxer Tony 'Bomber' Bellew), providing some of the most realistic cinematic boxing scenes (right there with Southpaw from earlier this year).It's a relief that Mr. Coogler and his co-writer Aaron Covington avoided the expected cheesiness, and instead focused on the intimate personal stories while also paying tribute to the legacy of the franchise  Bill Conlon's original score is heard at least once, the Philadelphia MOA steps have their moment, as does the Rocky statue that draws fans and selfies. Heck, there is even a disclosure of who won the Rocky III fight between Rocky and Apollo. It's that kind of nostalgia that complements this modern story and contemporary character.",7,0,3,23 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Mutant Mess
","Greetings again from the darkness. While a logical attempt to capitalize on the highly entertaining and profitable X Men series, this prequel just doesn't have much to offer other than a couple of fun fight scenes.Hugh Jackman is in full glory and seems to be having fun playing Logan/Wolverine, but his 'brother' Liev Schreiber is totally miscast and would have been better as Stryker ... though Danny Huston handles it just fine. Will i am, Tayor Kitsch (as Gambit) and Ryan Reynolds provide the only real characters of interest outside of the shiny the apparatus for wolverine.I guess it is a credit to the film series that we have come to expect more. Though it will be fine with true fans, this won't bring in many new ones.",5,9,22,3 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," The Greater Good
","Greetings again from the darkness. Brilliant comedy/spoof/homage co-written by rising star director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg ... yes, the team from 'Shaun of the Dead'. There are so many well written and deftly delivered punchlines here, one can hardly keep up.Supercop Pegg (named Nick Angel ... same as the film's music director) is 'promoted' off the London police squad and into a quaint little country village with no history of murder, but the world's highest 'accident' rate. Pegg partners up with stereotypical pudgy cop played perfectly by Nick Frost, who also happens to be the police chief's (Jim Broadbent) son. While every town death is casually explained away by the latest 'accident' report, Pegg continues to pursue the notion that evil retailer Timothy Dalton is behind it all. Not to give anything away, but Pegg's theories lead to some hilarious dialogue between all parties.Suffice to say, the film combines 'The Stepford Wives' with 'The Wicker Man' and then proceeds to throw in numerous references to Mr. Wright's favorite U.S. cop film 'Bad Boys II'. Working equally well as an homage or a spoof, the film does a terrific job of jabbing U.S. buddy films and action films. The shoot-outs are a hoot and it is so amazing to see so few wounded with so many rounds fired at close range.Other support work is provided by Paddy Considine, Bill Nighy and numerous other Wright favs. Don't miss a quick shot of LOTR director Peter Jackson as the slashing Santa or a masked Cate Blanchett as Pigg's ex.Two other notes of interest: look for a quick scene involving a lost goose with Stephen Marchant (one of the masterminds behind 'The Office'); and Mr. Wright also directed the best of the fake trailers, 'Don't', in the recent Tarantino/Rodriguez release 'Grindhouse'.",8,1,2,22 April 2007
The Others," Unlike the others, 'The Others has a story'
","Greetings again from the darkness.  2001 YTD has been a dreadful moviegoing experience.  I am not sure if this movie is really good, or just good compared to 'the others'.  Anyway, I did enjoy it, although the surprises were not really surprises.  In fact, I would have enjoyed a few more twists, which easily could have been written in.  The two kids were fascinating, although I am not sure what future the young boy has, except maybe playing an alien.  Definitely worth a peek, if you enjoy supernatural stuff.",8,0,0,11 September 2001
Brokeback Mountain," One Curve on the Road
","Greetings again from the darkness. One of the most anticipated films of the year, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a beautiful trip down a painful road. Based on the short story of Annie Proulx, the great Larry McMurtry has provided a screenplay that is both effective and affective. Director Ang Lee ('Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') does the rest.The two lead characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are very solid - Ledger is even exceptional in parts with his marble-mouth manner of speech. However, the two things that take this film to greatness are the painful story and the stunning photography. Although postcards play a role in the story, numerous shots in the film are as beautiful as any postcard or painting ever seen. Lee proves again that his eye for nature is without equal.If one can view this as a forsaken love story rather than a gay cowboy movie, the impact proves much greater - even powerful. While Gylenhaal's Jack 'f'n' Twist finds an easy way to cope, Ledger's Ennis continues his lifelong struggle with merely existing. His attempts at relationships are always missing something and we have no problem believing this is due to his very rough childhood. His marriage to Michelle Williams (Ledger's real life squeeze) is torturous to watch and she is marvelous in her discovering the truth about her husband. Randy Quaid has a nice turn as the boss who first hires Gylenhaal and Ledger, and Anne Hathaway is fine as Mrs. Twist.The real credit for this masterpiece goes to Lee, McMurtry and Proulx. A haunting guitar theme compliments a monumental piece of film story telling that covers two decades of forbidden and stolen love. Not always easy to watch, but definitely worth it.",8,17,19,18 December 2005
Spotlight," Faith
","Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith  the core of this 'based on actual events' story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by 'The Church'.It's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story  we even know how it snow-balled globally  but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all  All The President's Men (1976).The opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass.Flash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called 'Spotlight'. It's led by editor Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book 'The Curse of the Bambino', just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people.What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects – just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together – and how fluid the process was  the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to 'get' the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism  right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite – he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle – settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law – the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican.The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few 'best scenes'. Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions – we either need to hit something or throw up – and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers.The story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, 'It takes a village to raise a kid  or abuse one.' In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that.",9,96,184,12 November 2015
Terminator Salvation," Better than 3 day old Coyote
","Greetings again from the darkness. Can't quite put my finger on it. Amazing action and terrific special effects, stunning sound and a decent story that compliments the previous installments ... but still something is missing.First off, the casting is very odd throughout - Christian Bale as John Connor, Sam Worthington (in place of first choice Josh Brolin), bland Bryce Dallas Howard (replacing Claire Danes), Helena Bonham Carter (seriously??), Jane Alexander (in an action film??), and Common (with a competent scowl). Best choice is Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. Mr. Yelchin is having a nice summer with Terminator and Star Trek (where he is even better).Next, director McG is an odd choice. Which of the Charlie's Angels films qualified him for this? Actually, most of his work is decent, but his work with the actors left much to be desired.Thirdly, why the heck is Sam Worthington on screen more than Christian Bale? Just a wild guess, but I suppose there was quite a disparity in their paychecks!Can't help but get a kick out the tie-ins to previous installment - Linda Hamilton's voice on tape, re-treads of famous lines and even CGI Arnold making an appearance. The machinery and effects continue to amaze, but this time the humans just don't hold up.",6,0,2,30 May 2009
Aquaman," a swim through comic book mythology
","Greetings again from the darkness. Were the TV series 'Entourage' still on the air, they would now need a new recurring punchline. The AQUAMAN movie is real! At the helm, we are surprised to find the master of horror, James Wan, in the director's seat. Mr. Wan is known for such genre flicks as SAW, INSIDIOUS, and THE CONJURING, and his talent for visuals transfers well to the comic book style. In fact, with a run time of almost 2 ½ hours, the visual effects are both exhilarating and exhausting.Sure, we've seen short bursts of Jason Momoa as Aquaman in a couple of previous DC movies, but this time he owns the pool. Momoa plays Arthur Curry as a hunky beer-chugging rock and roll party dude who just happens to talk to fish and breathe underwater. Since it's the first Aquaman movie, writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (ORPHAN) and Will Beall (GANGSTER SQUAD) provide us the backstory.On the coast of Maine in 1985, a lighthouse attendant named Tom Curry (played by Temuera Morrison) discovers Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washed ashore. What follows is a whirlwind romance, the birth of their son Arthur, Nicole snacking on a goldfish, as well as her first kick-ass action fight scene. To protect her son, she agrees to head back to Atlantis where she faces the consequences of birthing a half-breed with a landlubber.When we first see a grown Arthur - with a classic hair flip - he is thwarting the hijacking of a Russian submarine by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father (Michael Beach, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK). Manta is one of the two main villains - the other being Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's war-mongering, power-thirsty half-brother. Sharing a common enemy, Orm enlists Manta and provides a highly-advanced weapon that, for some unfathomable reason, Manta begins (via montage) to 'Iron-Man' it to another level - one much less stable. It's Orm who gets much more screen time as he plots a massive attack on surface dwellers (humans) who have been destroying the sea for years. You didn't think Hollywood would miss a chance to tell us how despicable we are, did you?The basic story is that Orm must defeat Aquaman to claim the throne and become Master of the Sea. Of course, Arthur is reluctant to get involved and only does so at the urging of his old mentor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard), both of whom wish to avoid a war with humans. The first battle of the would-be kings takes place in The Ring of Fire, a royal battleground missing only the accompaniment of Johnny Cash. The duel ends prematurely, so that an epic battle can later serve as the film's epic climax.Although director Wan may throw a bit too much 'plot' and action at the proverbial wall, it is interesting to note the history/mythology associated with Atlantis, the ruling class, and the missing trident. The legends are fascinating and the journey takes us to all ends (and depths) of the globe ... from the deepest seas to the middle of the Sahara Desert (itself once a sea) to the incredible core of the Earth. We see the ancient ruins, as well as the high-tech futurama Atlantis ... and it's all stunning to watch.Don't tell Marvel, but the film is somewhat a blend of BLACK PANTHER and THOR, and Momoa is every bit the Aquaman that Chris Hemsworth is Thor (quite a compliment). Yes, we find out that Atlantis, like our dry land world, is burdened with politics and power-hungry types, but the underwater world and the visual effects keep us mesmerized. We see terrific dragon-like sea horses, a drumming octopus, and a Kraken-like creature supposedly voiced by Julie Andrews (fact or fiction?). There is an early sequence that takes swimming with dolphins to a level you didn't experience on your vacation, and the lighting effects at times recall TRON and can be a bit disorienting.This is probably the largest scale DC movie to date, and director Wan chooses to make a splash with every element - character, mythology, setting, and effects. We also get appearances from Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as a TV talking head/oceanographer making the case that Atlantis is real and a threat. We even get Roy Orbison singing 'She's a Mystery to Me', and the IMAX aspect ratio makes the first ever over-the-top underwater spectacle. And what a spectacle it is.",7,4,7,14 December 2018
500 Days of Summer," This is Not a Love Story
","Greetings again from the darkness. The narrator warns us upfront ... this is not a love story. Still, we are so preconditioned by Hollywood, that directive merely floated around in my head until near the end of the film when I realized it was perfectly accurate.Joseph Gordon-Levit and Zooey Deschanel are the leads and each bring a certain quirkiness and sensitivity to their roles. Watching them grow as a couple just never quite clicks for the viewer the way it does for JGL's character. He buys in hook, line and sinker and believes his destiny for love is being fulfilled by Summer (Zooey).Director Marc Webb throws a bit of everything at us - just to prove this is not a traditional love story. We get the fun of memory blender - flashbacks like Day 488, Day 2, Day 159 - well you get the point. That is how most of us remember anyway: non-linear. We also get a funny musical number in the park, a b & w Bergmanesque dramatization, and a leading man whose poetic musings are limited to his writing quips for a greeting card company. Oh, he also takes love advice from his 11 year old soccer-playing sister (Chloe Moretz), but wisely declines most of it from his best friend played by sexist, drunken (and funny) co-worker, Geoffrey Arend.What I really like about the film is that it is different, yet very realistic. So often our 'dream' girl is just not quite a fit in this world, yet she and the next guy are just right. Doesn't seem fair, but in reality, it is not only fair, but perfectly just. And remember, there is always another season ... maybe Autumn?",8,211,306,20 July 2009
Juno," All The Young Dudes
","Greetings again from the darkness. Much ado about screenwriter Diablo Cody's stripper past. If this script is any indication, maybe stripping should be mandatory for all Hollywood writers. It is funny, touching and moving ... all with a major dose of reality and social commentary. Director Jason Reitman ('Thank You For Smoking') has a definite feel for human angst when life delivers one of its many blows. Cody and Reitman deliver a fascinating story and an entertaining film at the highest level.Ellen Page (kinda creepy in 'Hard Candy') plays Juno, a spirited 16 yr old who winds up pregnant after seducing her best friend. Because of her age, Page's performance will probably not receive the notice it should. It is among the year's finest. Her sharp with and telling eyes and deadpan delivery make Juno someone we instantly care about, but not in a sappy way. Anyone with this much soul and spirit warrants our interest. Michael Cera ('Superbad') plays the track star-unlikely lover-boy, who maintains a sense of cool despite everything. Cera is fine casting, but the whole track star thing was impossible to buy for any guy who has ever run at all. Still that one minor quibble doesn't drag the film down at all. Some of the best scenes in the film are Cera and Page together, battling through teenager emotions.What takes this film to a whole other level is the peak behind the suburban utopia with Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. Unable to conceive on their own, they take out an ad and end up in the middle of Juno's world, and part of her hard life lesson. Garner flashes NONE of her usual annoying perkiness and is actually quite serious and focused on her somewhat unlikeable character. Bateman plays the guy who got forced into playing grown-up and is now looking for a way to escape. Pretty good stuff without going over the top.Juno's parents are played well by Allison Janney and JK Simmons, and her friend and confidant is played by the up and coming Olivia Thirlby. Thirlby and Page will team up (literally) again in next year's 'Jack and Diana'. Rainn Wilson, from 'The Office', has a couple of hilarious lines ... also seen in the previews ... but doesn't show up again.Yes, any film whose soundtrack includes Mott the Hoople and Velvet Underground gets points for coolness. This film has to be put in with the 'small' films that dedicated film lovers live for, but the masses rarely even hear about. Of course, due to the subject matter, it isn't for everyone ... but it is extremely high level story telling, with terrific acting and direction. One of the year's best for sure.",9,4,16,15 December 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," Holy Wooly Mammoth, Batman!
","Greetings again from the darkness.  This could have been titled 'The Poseidon Adventure's Towering Inferno on the Day after Independence Day'. Cliched special effects with lousy script and mostly lousy characters from director Roland Emmerich who delivered the same with 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla'.  Dennis Quaid is totally miscast as a super scientist dad to wunderkind Jake Gyllenhaal.  Best performance comes from Emmy Rossum (Sean Penn's daughter in 'Mystic River'). Did enjoy the tribute to 'Planet of the Apes' (Statue of Liberty), but most of the special effects were beyond belief and not all that special.  As with most mediocre movies, the real problem lies in the weak script.  I kept waiting for Gene Hackman to show up and yell 'If you want to live, follow me up this giant upside down Christmas tree'.  In the mode of the movie, I have very little else to say.",6,0,1,8 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Aye Calypso
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sure, the movie is probably 45 minutes longer than it should have been. And yes, there are a multitude of details that don't add up or are just left dangling. And granted, the franchise drifted away from the stellar humor on display in the classic first installment. But, if you see a lot of movies, you have to admit that the visual feast provided here by director Gore Verbinski is a fitting send off (hopefully) for these beloved Pirates! The usual suspects are all back ... Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann and Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. For some reason, Depp's screen time is again limited and Knightley's is expanded. She doesn't have the chops to pull off 'King of the Pirates', but Verbinski obviously enjoys seeing her face (and weak voice) on screen. Rush sparkles as Barbossa and Bill Nighy actually gets to show a glimpse of the face behind the tentacles! Naomie Harris has much more to do in this one as the pivotal Calypso character ... with some spectacular powers. And the always excellent Stellan Skaarsgard provides a touch of class as Bootstrap Bill. Joining the cast are Chow Yun-Fat as a powerful Singapore pirate and, of course, the much anticipated appearance of Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's dad.The story itself is a bit messy and convoluted, but again, this is about the visuals. The battle scenes are overwhelming and the ships are very impressive. For special effects, few, if any, have ever been better. The disappointment stems from what is a near waste of one of the most interesting and entertaining characters in film history, Jack Sparrow. The second and third films just didn't allow Depp to do much with Sparrow. When he does have screen time, the theatre comes alive with anticipation. Sparrow is who most of us have come to see. It could have been so much more.",6,0,2,28 May 2007
Don Jon," a Jersey dime
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's been a few months since I saw a screening, and I'm a bit surprised it's getting a wide release. On one hand, it's the directorial debut of the very talented and popular Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On the other hand, the subject matter is not exactly mainstream ... he plays a compulsive type who is addicted to online porn.There is a lot to like here. It's a front line observation of some things going on in society right now. Technology has quickly sucked away much of our face to face social interaction. Jon (JGL) has a compulsive personality. He is obsessed with cleaning his apartment, showing off his muscle car, perfecting his body at the gym, continuing his string of one-night stands with hot girls, and last but not least ... online porn. He sees nothing wrong with his addiction but readily admits his real life conquests don't meet his standards - no matter how pretty or personable they might be. Still, he goes through the motions of dance club pursuits to keep up his image with his buddies.Even when he heads home for dinner with his family, communication is a mess. His sister (the great Brie Larson) never puts down her phone. His parents (Glenne Hedley and Tony Danza) are bombastic and emotional. When Jon meets a 'dime' (translated to a perfect 10 ... why didn't Blake Edwards think of that?), his mother talks only of grandkids and his dad congratulates him on 'a nice piece of ___' (you get the point).See, this 'dime' is Barbara, played by Scarlett Johansson. She has the look Jon so values and since he has no concept of how a relationship works, she easily manipulates him to transition into her ideal man (rom-com movies, college courses, etc). In a very telling scene, Barbara and Jon take in a Rom-Com spoof 'based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks' and starring Anne Hathaway and Channing Tatum. Barbara's perfect man is a fictionalized knight in shining armor, while Jon's perfect woman is the latest porn star. Though the issues are identical, neither sees their own flaws ... only that of the other.The story takes a dramatic turn when Jon meets Esther (Julianne Moore) in a somewhat embarrassing incident (for him). The budding relationship between the older mentor and her student of life could have made a much more interesting movie and she guides him down a path of self-discovery.JGL, Scarlett and Ms. Moore are all very good in their roles, as is the entire supporting cast (Danza especially humorous as the perfectly cast dad). Although there are some very humorous scenes and lines in the film, I found it somewhat dis-spiriting due to the observations it makes on the young adult generation. The final act seemed a bit too clean for real life, but that doesn't take away from what is really a nice first outing for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a filmmaker. Stay tuned as I expect even better from him in the future.",6,8,18,25 September 2013
Deadpool 2," snarky and irreverent redux
","Greetings again from the darkness. We couldn't help but ask 'why?' when the sequel was announced, even though we knew the answer was money. There was little hope in improving on the first DEADPOOL (2016), and since that film's director, Tim Miller, was tied up with upcoming projects for X-Men and Terminator, there was understandable concern that changing the recipe could result in huge disappointment. While it may not be an improvement on the first, only those with unrealistic expectations are likely to be disappointed ... the rest of us will spend most of two hours laughing and enjoying the spectacle.Director David Leitch exploded onto the scene with last year's surprise action hit ATOMIC BLONDE, and his stuntman experience is once again on display with even more frenzied action and fight sequences this time out. As you might expect, there is no easing into the comedy routine here. The Opening Credits are laugh out loud funny and the only thing better may be the closing credits sequence, which is an instant classic.No punchlines will be spoiled here, and it's an obvious statement, but clearly no topic or subject, or at least very few, are off-limits. Targets of barbs include LinkedIn, YENTL, FROZEN, Fox & Friends, and well, the list goes on and on. You'll likely miss 20 percent of the dialogue whilst laughing. The 'Merc with a Mouth' breaks the 4th wall in atypical fashion - blurring the line through dialogue incorporated into the story. The self-awareness is comical in its own right.Some familiar faces are back. Wade's main squeeze Vanessa (Marina Baccarin) kicks off the 'kids' discussion (Yikes!) and the couple seems to have settled into cohabitant bliss - never a good sign in a superhero movie. TJ Miller (despite his recent headlines) is back running Sister Margaret's Bar, though his minimal presence is noted. Also back is Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic), and his expanded role finds him turning Deadpool into an X-Men trainee at Professor Xavier's School for the gifted. This occurs after tragedy strikes and we are introduced to some new players. Julian Dennison (so good in HUNT FOR THE WILDERBEAST) plays FireFist, and of course, the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin) shows us what happens when a time-travelling Terminator type is out for revenge. Snarking, mocking and irreverence remain in full force throughout, but if you happen to pay attention to the story, you'll notice a (not-so) subtle transition taking place. The renegade superhero shifts from loner to team player, and even picks up some life lessons along the way - mostly related to loss and collaboration. Deadpool even forms his own team called X-Force, and one of the more interesting members is Domino (Zazie Beetz), whose superpower is luck (yep). We do get a surprise cameo, and there's even a shot of Deadpool with no pants ... and it's markedly unsexy. The music selections are inspired, however, if you are unsure whether this movie is for you ... it probably isn't.",7,1,5,16 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," Mr. Sandman, Bring Me a Dream
","Greetings again from the darkness. Being a fan of the first one and disappointed in the second, I had high hopes for this one ... especially knowing Venom and Sandman would be battling Spidey! Director Sam Raimi (responsible for all three and possibly a fourth Spider-Man movie) turns this one into every bit the mess that Sandman is as he is washed out through the sewer system. Too bad the movie can't resurrect itself. Three good things: the black suit, the first few scenes of Sandman and the great Bruce Campbell. The bad things: pretty much everything else ... except a couple of scenes with Elizabeth Banks and an almost unrecognizable Theresa Russell (as Sandman's wife).Tobey Maguire just doesn't have the chops to pull off 'tough guy' Spider-Man. Raimi knew this and tried to instill much slapstick. Instead, we just get a failed SNL skit. Maguire has the nerdy Peter Parker down, but his Wes Bentley look flops big time. Kirsten Dunst continues to flaunt the worst hair of any female movie star and is in jeopardy of having her potentially huge career as a real actress pass her right by. James Franco is his usual bland 'little Goblin'.New bad guys include Thomas Haden Church ('Sideways') as Sandman and Topher Grace ('That 70's Show') as Venom. Church is very good, Grace is horrible. Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard is one of several excesses in the film, but it is nice to catch a quick glimpse of Willem Dafoe and an actual speaking role for creator Stan Lee.By far the funniest part of the film is Bruce Campbell as the French Maitre d' trying so hard to make the evening romantic for Parker and Mary Jane. The best special effects are the first few scenes of Sandman. Most of the other special effects are way over the top and lose their effectiveness.My absolute biggest complaint is the fact that every major character weeps like a baby at some point. Super heroes and villains shouldn't be weeping!! The amount of emotional junk included in the script is boring, poorly written and horribly executed. This gives the film a dragged out feeling and easily adds 25 unnecessary minutes to the film. Is it fun to watch? The action scenes definitely are. Is it a classic. Absolutely not. Please, Mr. Raimi, let the franchise rest in peace.",5,3,6,4 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Zeppelin, Cate, Goldblum
","Greetings again from the darkness. The ultimate cinematic dilemma  how to make the next comic book movie stand out from the (many, many) others? The brilliant answer comes from director Taika Waititi and co-writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost – a screwball superhero action film that delivers not only the required alien war scenes, but also a campy villain for the ages in a movie that may be the funniest of the year.For those who prefer their superheroes dark and brooding, this one will be a shock. Prepare for Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster – the most polite villain we've seen in awhile, and one who looks to be straight out of the 1960's 'Batman' series. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is one of many returning actors/characters, only this time he really gets to flash his comic timing on top of his Thunder God biceps. His love- hate, trust-no trust, see-saw relationship with brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in full force, as is the Bruce Banner banter with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). It's certainly more in line with GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY than the previous movies for Avengers. As much fun as Goldblum brings to the party, this is really Cate Blanchett's show. She is the frightening (with a dash of camp) Goddess of Death, and long-lost sister of Thor and Loki, and daughter of Odin (Anthony Hopkins). With a headdress that puts everyone at the Kentucky Derby to shame, Hela's enormous powers are such that she crumbles Thor's mighty hammer with little effort – just to remind everyone that big sisters are renowned for messing up younger brother's toys.Of course, with that title, we know that the story revolves around what could be the end of Asgard. Joining in the fun are: Idris Elba who is back as Heimdall, Tessa Thompson as a master of one-liners Valkyrie, Karl Urban as Skurge - rewarded with a wonderful exit scene, Ray Stevenson returns as Volstagg, and rocky alien Korg who is voiced by director Waititi. Fans of the series will be happy to know other familiar faces pop up periodically – one especially magical sequence teaches Loki a quick lesson.In addition to the main rescue story line, the powerful villains, and crazy aliens, there are numerous nods and tributes to previous versions (notably Planet Hulk, and Fantastic Four), and a hilarious early stage play with three cameos that make it clear, big time laughter is here to stay. It's fun to catch the reunions from such previous projects as Star Trek, JURASSIC Park and Westworld. Special acknowledgment goes to director Taika Waititi for hilariously taking the comic book film world down a different path. He's known for his comedic projects like HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (one of my favs from 2016), WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and his work on the brilliant but short-lived 'Flight of the Conchords'. It's still very much a Marvel movie, with visible fingerprints of Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. It's also a fantastic adventure film that sets the stage for next year's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, while also featuring the best use ever of Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song'. So get ready to rock, roll and rollick in a film that is just about as much fun as you can have in a theatre.",7,32,55,30 October 2017
Match Point," Luck and Deceit
","Greetings again from the darkness. Despite his lack of box office pop, Woody Allen has always been a terrific writer of relationship chaos. He also has recorded his love of New York City on film for the past 30 years. In what is his best work since 'Crimes and Misdemeanors', and belonging in the same high class as 'Manhattan' and 'Annie Hall', 'Match Point' has Mr. Allen exploring these same relationship topics within his newly discovered Britain setting.With the recurring theme of luck (the word is used at least 11 times in the script), the film takes Chris, a former Irish tennis pro ('Bend it Like Beckham' coach Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and tosses him into the upper crust of the British elite. Surprisingly enough, he fits right in. Not so surprisingly, he falls in love with wealth and its privileges. An Allen staple, the twists and turns of relationships and family life develop into quite a mess for our tennis boy. Married to, and adored by, rich girl Chloe (played exceedingly well by Emily Mortimer), Chris also falls hard under the spell of sultry, struggling American actress and seductress Nola, slightly overplayed by Scarlet Johansson. Some of the best scenes are the ones exhibiting the entire family, including Chris' in-laws played by Brian Cox (who is the new Gene Hackman - seemingly in half the movies released) and Penelope Wilton ('Pride and Prejudice' 'Calendar Girls') and a self-indulgent Matthew Goode (the chasing agent in 'Chasing Liberty'). Quite often these scenes occur right before and right after a passionate (way beyond the norm for Allen) tryst between Chris and Nola creating quite the tension for the viewers.The canvas of London is surprisingly similar to Manhattan as seen through the eye of Allen and this is quite a compliment. Another Allen trademark is his use of music, and opera is the call here. The blending of opera both visually and through the soundtrack provide the tempo and feel that Allen wants us to experience. An interesting side note is that Chris' driver is played by John Fortune, a British TV star.For those of us who love multi-layered stories and watching people attempt to dig themselves out of their own mess, 'Match Point' is a gem. For those looking for any old fashioned Woody humor, head to the video store. This is a grown-up story with twists and turns and is very dark in nature, and I consider myself 'lucky' to have seen it.",9,10,16,7 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," Library of Dreams
","Greetings again from the darkness. Not so many years ago, Woody Allen was thought of as the quintessential New York City filmmaker (along with Martin Scorcese). He understood that and even poked fun at himself in his most popular film Annie Hall. At age 75, Mr. Allen remains an incredibly prolific filmmaker cranking out a new script and film every year. With his recent work, he has ventured outside of NYC and into England, Spain and now France. Clearly these new locales have re-energized his creativity.The script for Midnight in Paris is some of his best writing in years, and he explores our love of nostalgia without sacrificing the customary relationship struggles. While I hold steadfast to my rule of providing no spoilers, a quick glance at the character names gives you all the clues you need to put the basic idea in place.Owen Wilson plays Gil, a financially successful Hollywood screenwriter who longs to be a serious novelist in the vein of his literary heroes from 1920's Paris. Gil goes on vacation to Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). Of course the parents don't like Gil and it doesn't take long (maybe one scene) for us to figure out that Gil and Inez are misfits as a couple.In an attempt to escape the yammering of Inez's know-it-all friend played by Michael Sheen, Gil goes wandering the nighttime streets of Paris. What happens next is either science-fiction or the culmination of Gil's dreams. The bell tolls midnight and Gil is whisked away via a classic Peugeot to the world of literary giants he so worships.Half the fun as a viewer in this one is staying alert to pick up the clues to the references: Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Juan Belmonte, Alice B Toklas, Djuna Barnes, TS Eliot, Matisse, Leo Stein, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin, Degas, Cole Porter and Picasso. Kathy Bates spikes the film with her lively turn as Gertrude Stein. Corey Stoll makes a ferociously direct Ernest Hemingway. Adrien Brody offers up a slightly off-center Salvador Dali - good for a laugh.This movie plays kind of like an all-star game. A chance to see all the names and players that you have heard about ... all under one roof. For film lovers, there is a great little exchange between Owen Wilson's character and Luis Bunuel. Woody has created a 90 minute tribute to all of us (like Gil) who have yearned to work with and live among the artistic giants. I would love to see Mr. Allen's notes as he put this idea together. We can only imagine what didn't make the film! Despite all the fun of inside jokes, the romantic idea of nostalgia and wishing for a better time is discussed and analyzed. Mr. Allen tells us that EVERYONE, no matter their era, has a romantic vision of some previous time which they believe would better suit their style and creative force. The story is balanced by having Gil's novel based in a nostalgia store, and he ends up meeting an intriguing young lady (Lea Seydoux) at a Paris store that sells old records and books.As always, Mr. Allen has beautiful music accompanying his words and scenes. This time we are also treated to some breathtaking images of Paris, the Seine, and wonderful works of art (Rodin, Picasso, etc). Of course casting Carla Bruni, wife to the President of France (Nicolas Sarkozy) might have entitled him to film in settings we don't often see in movies. One gets the impression that this one was quite a bit of fun for Woody to assemble. If you enjoy art or literary history, you too will find this to be one jolly easter egg hunt!",7,2,5,7 June 2011
Youth," Youth is in the eye of the beholder
","Greetings again from the darkness. With a Best Foreign Language Oscar for his previous film The Great Beauty (La grande bellezza), expectations were sky high for this one from writer/director Paolo Sorrentino. Cinematographer Luca Bigazzi is also back and the two create yet another artistic entrée that is a visual extravaganza, worthy of the admission price even if no dialogue existed. Combine the visual artistry with a commentary on age and emotions, and the result is a film that will either enchant or stultify  with probably no middle ground.Michael Caine stars as Fred Ballinger, a renowned Orchestra conductor, who is vacationing at a stunning Swiss Alps spa with his daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) and his long-time best friend, screenwriter Mick Boyd (Harvey Keitel). Fred, a self-professed retiree, is being pursued by Queen Elizabeth's representative to perform one last concert. Fred is adamant in his refusal  for personal reasons we later learn are due to his nostalgic belief that his wife (no longer able to sing) is the only one who will sing his 'simple' songs as long as he is alive. In the meantime, Mick is working with a group of ambitious young writers in an attempt to leave a legacy with his most important film ever. So you can already see that both men are working through their golden years in different ways.Lena is devastated when her husband dumps her for a young pop singer (played by the real pop singer, Paloma Faith). Oh, one other detail  Lena's husband is also Mick's son (Ed Stoppard). This makes for some awkward (but entertaining) moments, and also leads to one of the film's best scenes – Lena spilling her emotional guts to Fred while they are both covered in a mud bath. Director Sorrentino is a master at twisting these poignant moments with dashes of levity or irony. Another example is when Miss Universe (Romanian model Madalina Diana Ghenea) puts a condescending movie actor (Paul Dano) in his place with a devastating shift in tone and a comeback for the ages.Sorrentino executes a couple of bizarre dream or fantasy sequences – one with Fred conducting a cow pasture (replete with cows and other bits of nature), and another with Mick being haunted in a meadow by all the female stars from his films (each in costume of their character). Suffice to say, this is not a conventional look at aging. What's also clear is that Sorrentino believes our emotions drive our actions. The most jarring example is the aftermath when Mick's long-time leading lady Brenda Morel (played by Jane Fonda) declines to appear in his latest film.Even the most bizarre segments are presented with a visual artistry that forces our brains to process overtime. How about an obese Diego Maradona (played by Roly Serrano) repeatedly kicking tennis balls into the air? Or big time actor Jimmy Tree (Dano) struggling with his decision to sellout by appearing in a popular robot movie instead of pursuing his desire to be taken seriously as an actor? Or Lena bouncing back with a socially awkward mountain man? Or the seemingly minor role of a young masseuse (played by Luna Zimic Mijovic) who has us yearning for more? In addition to how each of these segments is startling to look at, Jane Fonda's role has so many nuances that an entire movie could be made about her.As with The Great Beauty, the film will have the most profound impact on those of us old enough to be looking through the binoculars and noticing how far away the past looks  and wondering just how long until 'Life's Last Day'.",7,48,58,16 December 2015
Zodiac," The Most Dangerous Game
","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the true story of the 25 year search for the Zodiac killer ... a serial killer who's multiple homicide's (somewhere between 13-51) remain unsolved. The source material for the film is the book 'Zodiac Unmasked' by Robert Graysmith portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal.Despite common knowledge that the case remains unsolved, director David Fincher ('Fight Club', 'Seven') creates a good deal of suspense and captures the frustration of those who spent years chasing this monster. The lead detectives are played by Anthony Edwards and Mark Ruffalo. Other key law enforcement officials are played by Donal Logue, Elias Koteas and Dermot Mulroney. Brian Cox and Philip Baker Hall have key support roles and the great Chloe Sevigny is cast as Gyllenhaal's wife. I must mention the single scene featuring Clea Duvall as an inmate with some insight. Always nice to see her work. In a very interesting selection, the main suspect (Arthur Lee Allen) is played by John Carroll Lynch, the gentle husband in 'Fargo'.The film has a couple of confusing moments or loose ends ... such as the entire sequence when Gyllenhaal interviews the former movie theatre manager. However, I would compare the film to 'All The President's Men' in its structure of presenting the investigation of the mystery. Robert Downey, Jr. is once again remarkable, this time as the lead San Francisco Chronicle reporter who is threatened by Zodiac. Downey's subsequent breakdown is realistic and painful.Although not much humor exists in the film, I couldn't help but chuckle as Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo are trading ideas in a late night café. You couldn't find two actors with bigger puppy dog eyes than these two! Still, it doesn't ruin the intensity and Fincher does a great job at capturing the desperation of Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal throughout the film ... as each of their lives begin to crumble.Justice can be a very complicated manner, but I believe Graysmith feels that his final connection with the main suspect was all he needed to complete his story and put his mind at ease. The man was not locked up, but the mystery was now unlocked. For those who enjoy the investigative side of crime, this one is definitely worth seeing. Two interesting notes ... the soundtrack contains an almost overwhelming number of period songs, and don't miss the cameo from Ione Skye, who's father Donovan's 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' has a key role on the soundtrack.",8,2,7,3 March 2007
Milk," Gotta Give 'em Hope
","Greetings again from the darkness. Bio-Drama based on the political rise of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to office, is much more than that. It is a reminder of just how ridiculous and closed minded the establishment was just 30 short years ago. Seeing Anita Bryant brought back some scary memories and reminds us just how important it is to understand an issue PRIOR to passing judgment.Sean Penn turns in yet another of his seemingly endless top-notch performances. However, this time he is not the brooding, mumbling type ... he is the action-oriented, quick thinking, charismatic leader of the gay movement in the 70's, and he is spot on as Harvey Milk. The film does not portray Milk as a perfect man, but does spend most of the time on his mission to be elected in order to provide a voice for the gay movement.Excellent support work by Emile Hirsch and James Franco, and Josh Brolin takes on the tough role of Dan Brown, a good man who just couldn't understand why people listened to Milk instead of him. I can't comment on Diego Luna's performance, because it is extremely flamboyant. My guess is that is probably an accurate portrayal of Milk's lover.Director Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy) does a masterful job of capturing the feel of the times through sets and a mixture of news footage and other actual video. We get a feel for the cause without dwelling on the discrimination and outright abuse that this group absorbed. While not a documentary, it is a strong recollection of a very explosive time in U.S. history.",8,13,26,30 November 2008
The Prestige," Not Today, Double Fantasy
","Greetings again from the darkness. Comparisons with 'The Illusionist' will abound as both are 19th century pieces centering on England's fascination with magicians and illusionists during that period. Although the settings are similar, it is important to note that 'The Illusionist' is at its core a love story, while 'The Prestige' is the tale of dueling illusionists and their fierce, even deadly, competition to be known as the BEST.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are the competing masters of illusion and after an onstage accident caused by Bale causes the death of Jackman's true love, the quest for best takes off on tangents that few could predict. To help confuse the issue, another master of illusion directs the film! Christopher Nolan brings his warped 'Memento' twists and turns to us so that we, as viewers, are left floundering at what the next trick will be.The cast includes Michael Caine in a pretty strong role and Scarlett Johansson, who is given little to do other than squeeze into an assistant's costume and wear gobs of lipstick. There are nice turns from Piper Perabo ('Coyote Ugly'), Andy Serkis ('LOTR', 'King Kong') and David Bowie (yes, THAT David Bowie) as world renowned scientist Tesla, who himself is in a competition with Thomas Edison.Although many of the plots twists are pretty easy to see coming, it is nonetheless a joyous ride for those of us who enjoy a wild screenplay. And it must be noted that Bale is just outstanding as his brooding and near mystical presence adds a great deal to the film. So chalk up another victory for Mr. Nolan, and please don't give away any of the fun to those who have not seen the film.",8,0,0,22 October 2006
Cloverfield," I'll Document
","Greetings again from the darkness. Have been trying to find something good to say about the film and all I can come up with is that it's unconventional. I am a fan of unconventional, but prefer it mixed with a dose of substance. This is nothing more than a bunch of second tier TV actors running around being filmed in the dark by some hand held cameras. Blair Witch Project blended with Godzilla on September 11 just as the War of the Worlds begins.The only suspense here is whether anyone in your audience will barf from motion sickness. OK, it is loud. And unconventional. Oh, another positive ... there are no opening credits and no need to stick around for the closing credits. The best of the actors is Lizzy Caplan, who gives her best (but not good enough) Zooey Deschanel impersonation.Oh, and there is a monster who changes shapes and experiences no apparent side effects from the mightiest military weapons. That is unconventional. Director Matt Reeves ('Felicity' is his main claim) doesn't give us too many real shots of the monster, which is probably a good thing.Pretty sure most of this was filmed on a sound stage and I assume there were numerous camera operators ... one's arms would get awfully tired jiggling a camera around non-stop. Not sure who the target audience is since we never really get a chance to know any characters, but I will say the film is unconventional ... and lacking substance.",3,30,92,19 January 2008
Silent Hill," Radha in cuffs!
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have no idea if you have to be familiar with the video game to appreciate this mess of a movie, but I do know it was a major disappointment. A horror film cannot be plodding, boring and void of chills, thrills and frights.Some individual scenes had a touch of coolness and the premise of a sleepwalking kid saying the name of a ghost town has plenty of potential. The problems start and never end once the mom (played well enough by the talented Radha Mitchell) and kid arrive in the foggy, dusty, zombie-religious freak filled town. The normally solid Laurie Holden ('X-Files') is just plain terrible as an over the top, oh-so-caring motorcycle cop. She may be the creepiest thing in the film. Uber-cool Sean Bean is just plain wasted in his limited role. On top of everything else, the music and score are not up to the task and make a dull film even slower.Wasted potential is always a shame and I realize fans of the video game are loving this movie, but most any fan of horror films will be very disappointed and will probably find themselves chuckling quite often. The only time you will jump out of your seat will be when the movie finally ends.",4,1,5,26 April 2006
Hotel Rwanda," There's always room
","Greetings again from the darkness. Don Cheadle's Academy Award nomination for Hotel Rwanda is a well deserved and a wonderful thing. Hopefully it will encourage even more to see director Terry George's incredibly moving tale of the 1994 Rwanda crisis between the Tutsis and the Hutu. As with Schindler's List, nothing is more powerful than a real life hero. Paul Rusesabagina is a real life hero. With the slaughter of nearly a million right outside his front gate, Paul R gave refuge to nearly 1000 who surely would have died. The tour de force by Cheadle is with his divergent performance from the elegant Hotel manager to the smooth negotiator to the passionate husband, parent and humanist. This man cares about people and what is right. Although, Nick Nolte's performance was slightly askew, the movie is well paced and heartfelt and should be seen by many. Very powerful.",9,2,2,29 January 2005
Once," When Your Mind's Made Up
","Greetings again from the darkness. Very disappointing movie offering little more than 90 minutes of music videos wrapped around a very weak story of attraction and chasing one's dreams. It has all been done much better numerous times.Glen Hansard sings his way through the film and I personally enjoy his music very much. Marketa Irglova, as his muse, is truly enchanting and a pleasure to look at and listen to. But I never bought the sparks between the two and certainly never saw any real bond other than the music.Cool music and a hand held camera make for a nice little home movie but should not be considered fine film making. A story and a script would go a long way in improving this one from musician/director John Carney.",6,7,14,17 June 2007
Ready Player One," Easter egg hunt with goggles
","Greetings again from the darkness. While there is a massive target audience for Steven Spielberg's return to fantasy adventure filmmaking, I am most certainly not part of that esteemed group. Although I very much enjoy throwbacks and tributes, I haven't touched a video game controller in 3 decades, and of course have not read Ernest Cline's popular novel - the source material that inspired Mr. Spielberg to veer from his recent heavy dramas (the exception being THE BFG). Still, being a movie lover, I couldn't help but be intrigued by the project.
Seemingly a match made in Virtual Reality heaven, we get one of the premier fantasy filmmakers joining forces with a screenwriter (Zak Penn) who has had success with comic book adaptions, and a bestselling first novel from a geeky author. Fascinating to watch, the film plays like Mr. Spielberg's $175 million personal toy box. There is a story, though one could argue it exists solely for the purpose of pushing the visual FX envelope. A Steve Jobs-type guru named Halliday (Mark Rylance) designed a 3-part contest of skill and strategy with the grand prize being full control over OASIS - a virtual world that allows the players to be anyone or anything they desire. Since Halliday's death, most people in this dystopian future of the year 2045 spend their waking hours immersed in OASIS. Some use it as an escape from their bleak lives, while others are attempting to solve the mysteries of the 3 keys.Set in Columbus, Ohio, which we are informed is the fastest growing city in the world (why??), there are two factions vying for the grand prize: true gamers/gunters and megacorporation IOI being run by corporate villain Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). Tye Sheridan (MUD) stars as Wade Watts, whose avatar is Parzival, one of the more thoughtful characters. Olivia Cooke (THOROUGHBREDS) plays Ar3mis, a rebel gunter (egg hunter) out more for revenge than victory. They are part of a group of misfits who label themselves 'High-Five', even though Parzival gets left hanging every time. Near non-stop action and relentless pacing result in a whirlwind of lights and colors and visuals that are mixed with more 1980's pop culture references than anyone could possibly catch in one viewing. As a primer, you should brace yourself for a key role from THE IRON GIANT (1999), as well as various appearances and nods to TRON, BACK TO THE FUTURE, Freddie Krueger, Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY, the Holy hand grenade (Monty Python), the infamous Big Foot monster truck, a speeding DeLorean, the 1960's era Batmobile, that hideous A-Team van, Christine from CHRISTINE (1983), John Hughes, King Kong, BEETLEJUICE, and a personal favorite, Buckaroo Bonzai. It's also a kick to see the Rubik renamed Zemeckis Cube. The most stunning sequence for this old geezer was the virtual recreation of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING (1980), especially the focus on Room 237. It's these kind of nostalgic injections that prevent it from coming across as an overblown CGI spectacle with VR goggles.Others in the cast (more time as voices than real people) include Lena Waithe ('Master of None'), TJ Miller as a bounty hunter with some of the film's best one-liners, Simon Pegg as Halliday's former business partner, and Phillip Zhao as Sho. Surely you've figured out that this one isn't about the cast. OASIS is where your imagination rules and Easter eggs are driving plot lines. Alan Silvestri takes over the music from usual Spielberg collaborator John Williams, and delivers one of my favorite references (and one of the oldest) in the film - Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971). Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski must have been exhausted by the time filming was complete, though we can't always tell what was filmed and what was created in the lab. Spielberg is a master manipulator when it comes to nostalgia, though we can't help but wonder if he is making a statement with this being the next evolution as our society becomes ever-more-involved with their phones and personal devices. At least maybe some kid will leave this film with a greater appreciation of research.",6,1,3,5 April 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Circus Mole
","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the best-selling 1974 John LeCarre' spy novel, opinions on this movie will cover the full spectrum. Many will find it painfully slow and impossible to follow. Others will be thrilled with the subtle clues and reality-based exchanges between British spies in the early 70's. This is no James Bond thriller with exploding yachts, world class fist fights and bikini-clad women. Rather, it's a peek at what real life spies do ... huddle in soundproof rooms and exchange information through stunted conversation where just shy of enough is said.John LeCarre' actually worked for the British Secret Service prior to becoming an author (also wrote 'The Constant Gardener' and 'The Russia House'). He based the story around when a traitor was uncovered during the biggest scandal in the history of British intelligence. This story covers some of that and even more. We see how trust and loyalty are so crucial, yet none of these men ever fully trusts the fellow agent sitting next to him. Very little is spoken, but much is communicated through a nod, raised eye brow, a slight cock of the head, or even the adjustment of one's spectacles. Cigarettes and scotch are the common ground from which discussions spring.Director Tomas Alfredson is from Sweden and delivered the exceptional vampire drama 'Let the Right One In' a couple of years ago. Mr. Alfredson has a distinctive feel for the look of a film, and atmospheric is a word that fits this movie, as well as his earlier one. The tone, color and texture is key to this world and we are immersed in blues and grays. His camera work is unique and wondrous as he massages the small, confined spaces and allow us to pick up the gestures of all involved.The cast is a group of wonderfully talented (mostly) men: Mark Strong, John Hurt (Control), Toby Jones (Tinker), Colin Firth (Tailor), Ciaran Hinds (Soldier), David Dencik (Poor Man)and Stephen Graham. Especially enjoyable are Tom Hardy as a rogue agent who breaks the 'mole' theory wide open, Benedict Cumberbatch as the youngest agent, and of course, Gary Oldman as George Smiley. Oldman's performance will awe many and bore a few. This is a man trained to say only what must be said. You can see the resolve in his eyes. These still waters run VERY deep. Some will compare him to the performance of Sir Alec Guiness in the BBC production, and both terrific and strong.While a rousing recommendation would be nice, it's just not in the cards. This movie will have a very specific audience ... those who thrive on mental jigsaw puzzles and are inspired by juggling an endless stream of characters and possible plots. If that describes you, then get in line on opening day.",7,2,3,20 December 2011
The Hateful Eight," Dead or Alive
","Greetings again from the darkness. If one is to believe Quentin Tarantino, the leaked script scandal nearly turned this into a novel, rather than what it clearly needed to be  a Quentin Tarantino movie (his 8th). It could even be considered a companion piece to Django Unchained (though this takes place in snowy Wyoming, as opposed to the balmy Deep South). It's set soon after the Civil War and there still exists a palpable uneasiness between Confederate and Union types, creating a constantly teetering milieu between violence and progress.Tarantino's obsession with classic film led him to utilize the same Ultra Panavision 70 lenses used for Ben-Hur (1959), which required the retrofitting of 50 theaters across the country for the 'road show'. This presentation includes an opening musical Overture, a midpoint Intermission, and approximately 6 minutes of footage that highlight this rarely used format  stunning snow-filled vistas and wide shots of the frontier. When the film opens nationwide, the digital version will be straight-forward (though still nearly 3 hours in run time). The 'road show' features are bonuses for us film geeks, and will have no impact on whether one enjoys the film or not.Rather than follow in John Ford's majestic Western footsteps, QT has the vast majority of the story take place within a one-room set called Minnie's Haberdashery. Thanks to a record blizzard, the general store/saloon turns into a human snake pit filled with nefarious types who are quick with a quip and a trigger. The diabolical assemblage is made up of John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell, featuring world class whiskers), a bounty hunter who is handcuffed to his latest prize Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh); another bounty hunter (Union) Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson); British fancy boy Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) who says he's the hangman for Red Rock; the self-professed new Sheriff of Red Rock Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins); General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), a former Confederate officer; quiet cowpoke Joe Gage (Michael Madsen); and Senor Bob (Demian Bichir), whom Minnie left tending the store in her absence.Now as you might expect, some of the above descriptions may be true, while others could be considered 'conveniences'. What you also might expect is a steady rain of Tarantino dialogue delivered by the perfectly chosen cast. Each of these players grasps the cadence required to make this work  they have the rhythm of a stage play – a new direction that Tarantino has hinted at. And have no fear, over-the-top violence fills the second half of the story as the confined space and contradictory missions begin to clash.No more need be said about the characters or the story. Russell, Jackson, Goggins and Ms. Leigh are especially effective at enlivening their scenes, and they are joined by supporting actors such as Dave Parks (son of the great Michael Parks), Gene Jones (who didn't wish to call the coin flip in No Country for Old Men), Dana Gourrier (as Minnie), QT favorite Zoe Bell (as Six-horse Judy), and even Channing Tatum.Legendary composer Ennio Morricone delivers his first western score in about 40 years, which is important since he's the man behind the iconic music of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. On the topic of music, Morricone's score is complimented by only a smattering of other songs (including a Roy Orbison gem and a solo from Jennifer Jason Leigh), which is unusual in the Tarantino canon. Three-time Oscar winner Robert Richardson re-teams with Tarantino and seems to have a blast with the challenges presented by the one-room set  he plays with focus and depth to create some fantastic shots. It should also be noted that the Sound is spectacular – everything from gunshots, to swirling wind, to boots and spurs, to galloping stage coach horses, and even the pouring out of coffee.All of the above results in a stunning movie experience with the anticipated QT humor, violence, and anti-racism sentiment (though the N-word usage is once again tough to take)  yet somehow the final product doesn't equal the individual moments of genius. It comes across as a blend of Agatha Christie, (Tarantino's own) Reservoir Dogs, and John Carpenter's The Thing minus the cohesiveness required for a great movie. So enjoy the characters, the technical achievements, and the terrific dialogue, but know that it's unlikely to be one of those that cause you to stop down while surfing cable channels in a couple years.",7,9,32,27 December 2015
"I, Tonya"," a perfect landing
","Greetings again from the darkness. Your recollection of Tonya Harding is likely not that she was the 1991 U.S. Champion figure skater and a two-time Olympian. And rather than honoring her as the first female skater to land a triple axel in competition, you likely remember 'the incident' in 1994 where she whacked her on-ice rival Nancy Kerrigan on the knee with a club. Only Ms. Harding wasn't the one who attacked Ms. Kerrigan ... and that's only the beginning to what director Craig Gillespie (LARS AND THE REAL GIRL) and writer Steven Rogers (P.S. I LOVE YOU, and a bunch of other mushy stuff) detail in this madcap look at a reality infinitely stranger than most fiction.Margot Robbie (THE WOLF OF WALL STREET) stars as Tonya Harding, and it's a career-defining performance ... funny, tragic, physical and emotionally charged. This isn't the expected bleak biopic, but rather it's a brilliant blend of parody, docudrama, and dark comedy focused on some real life folks that will surely make you grateful for your life. Harding's abusive, profane and icy mother LaVona is played with aplomb by Allison Janney, who manages to bring some humor to the role of a woman whose approach went far beyond the realm of tough love and straight into cruelty. Sebastian Stan plays Tonya's husband Jeff Gillooly and Paul Walter Hauser is Shawn Eckhardt, his friend and co-conspirator. In regards to these last two gents, we spend most of the film trying to decide if they are goofy, ignorant or downright dangerous (or all of the above).Director Gillespie expertly weaves together the domestic scenes, ice skating scenes, and 'current' interviews with the main characters. The domestic scenes include Tonya and Jeff, Tonya and her mother, Eckhardt with Tonya and Jeff, and Eckhardt with his own parents. The ice skating scenes emphasize how hard Tonya worked and her relationship with Coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson), while the interviews (recreated from actual interviews) provide contradictory details from the memories of Tonya, Jeff, Eckhardt and LaVona. The film tries not to make fun of them, but they kind of do it to themselves.Bobby Cannavale appears as a 'Hard Copy' reporter who provides some story structure by walking us through the timeline as reported by the media at the time. McKenna Grace plays a young Tonya, while Caitlin Carver is Nancy Kerrigan. Tonya has long been labeled as the most 'notorious' figure skater, and a failed boxing career was the closest she came to capitalizing on her notoriety after the scandal. Her life and the incident have been the basis for songs, books, news specials, documentaries, TV parodies, and even a Brooklyn-based museum. The film reminds us that truth and recollections are open to interpretation, and that there is much more to the story than what was reported. Respect is too much for Tonya to hope for, but this excellent and entertaining film might deliver a dose of compassion or empathy (along with incredulity and some laughs).",8,8,16,20 December 2017
Molly's Game," Molly and X and FBI
","Greetings again from the darkness. Aaron Sorkin's dialogue is like a rap battle with proper grammar and no down-beat. He must have been abused by pregnant pauses and moments of silence as a kid, as his screen banter gives new meaning to 'the fast and the furious'. This latest is his directorial debut, but his loquacious diatribes have previously tested our attention spans in such films as STEVE JOBS, MONEYBALL, and of course, THE SOCIAL NETWORK (for which he won an Oscar).Molly Bloom's memoir is the adapted source material, and though her story might be a bit challenging to show, there is certainly much to tell ... which is right in Mr. Sorkin's wheelhouse. The verbal sparring amongst characters rarely pauses, and when it does, we have Molly immediately jumping in as narrator and guide. The ultra-talented Jessica Chastain (ZERO DARK THIRTY) takes on the Molly role, and narrates her back story at break-neck speed (there is a pun in there). We learn her psychologist father (Kevin Costner) pushed her hard as a kid and she became off-the-charts intelligent while also being a world-class downhill skier. A freak accident ended her athletic career, and after deciding to delay law school, Molly found herself working for a real estate agent in Los Angeles. Soon he got her involved with hosting the high-stakes underground poker games he ran for local celebrities, and being a quick study, she was soon running and managing her own games. When Molly was forced to take her game to New York, the players transformed from movie stars and professional athletes to business magnates, hedge-fund managers and, unbeknownst to her, the Russian mob.Don't mistake this for a poker movie. Cards and chips are everywhere, but this is Molly's story, and Sorkin wisely simplifies the poker details and focuses more on Molly's brilliant strategy to build her business. Of course, there wouldn't be much to this were it just rich people playing poker. Less than a decade in, Molly is arrested in an overblown FBI sting featuring 17 armed agents at her pre-dawn door. The charges ranged from money-laundering to hedge-fund fraud to dealings with the Russian mob. The criminal charges lead Molly into the offices of defense attorney Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), who is reticent to take what appears to be an unwinnable case. The Sorkin back-and-forth kicks into full gear as Molly and Jaffey expertly verbally spar until she convinces him that she is adamant in not wanting anyone else to get hurt - even if it might save her proverbial rear-end.Although Sorkin doesn't name names, it takes very little research effort to determine some of the featured players in Molly's games. Hints are provided such as 'green screen', New York Yankee player, and Oscar winner. Michael Cera is identified only as Player X, but it's quite obvious he is playing the noted green screen actor, and he does a nice job in a small, but vital role. The rest of the cast offers up colorful work: Jeremy Strong as Molly's first boss, a very funny Chris O'Dowd, Brian d'Arcy as 'Bad Brad', Justin Kirk as a rock star, Angela Gots as the wise table dealer, and the always great Bill Camp as Harlan, whose story highlights the true risk in this supposed game of skill. Graham Greene has a nice moment as the judge hearing Molly's case, and it's likely the first time he and Kevin Costner have appeared in the same film since DANCES WITH WOLVES.At times the film and story bear a slight resemblance to THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, but mostly it's one woman's journey through entrepreneurship and a web of legalities. Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible' is used as a comparable for protecting one's own name, as well as a life lesson for Jaffey's young daughter. Writer Sorkin predictably surpasses first time director Sorkin, and never is that more obvious than a cringe-inducing father/daughter scene on a park bench near the end of the film. It's designed to wrap up Molly's inspiration and influence, but plays like a cheap Hollywood ploy to mop up loose ends. Molly deserved better, and fortunately most of the movie delivers.",7,1,6,24 December 2017
The Adventures of Tintin," Planes, Trains, Automobiles, Ships, ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Not that I am hoping for marital strife, but I like it when Steven Spielberg wants to get out of the house. This year he has delivered awards contender 'War Horse' and this crowd pleasing motion-capture animation film (also) for the whole family. If you are unfamiliar with Tintin, it is a long-running, extremely popular European comic series by Herge', who passed away in 1983.Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) is an investigative newspaper reporter who looks 12, but clearly isn't. He lives on his own, travels the world and is treated like an adult by those with whom he crosses paths. There is an early scene where Tintin is sitting for a local artist and the resulting portrait is the exact simple look of the comic series. Tintin has a trusty sidekick ... his genius little dog, Snowy. Together they go on adventures that Indiana Jones can only dream about! This particular story focuses on the hunt for the lost Haddock family treasure. Tintin literally stumbles into the drunken sea Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) who is more concerned with his next swig of whiskey than the the fact that he has been kidnapped by the bad guy Rackham/Sakharine (Daniel Craig). This bad guy has unlocked the mystery location of all the clues to the lost treasure and needs Captain Haddock for the final step. Unfortunately for him, Tintin and Snowy get in the way and try their darndest to stop him.The action sequences are amongst the most exciting and thrill-packed that you will ever see. They look like 'Jonny Quest' on steroids. The story is quite convoluted and complicated and small kids will be totally lost on exactly WHY the characters do what they do. But it won't much matter, because the visuals of each scene are captivating. There are even a couple of Interpol agents on the trail ... Thompson and Thomson (voiced by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, respectively).Spielberg has always done nice work when he can go after a kid's imagination - even big kids like me. The look of this movie is pretty amazing, especially when compared to the 2004 'The Polar Express'. If you doubt how far technology has come, look at these two side by side. Herge' creation is given script work here by Steven Moffatt, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. The great John Williams provides the score. This is one you can bring the kids to and all will enjoy.",7,1,5,23 December 2011
Ocean's Twelve," Looking for Col Tom Parker
","Greetings again from the darkness. Best to walk into the theatre knowing that this is Hollywood fluff and meant to be nothing but a light movie watching experience. Think Elvis movies from the 60's with hot shot director Soderberg behind the camera. Preening and posing are the norm and style over substance is required for camera time (count how many times Brad Pitt smirks). Wonderkind Soderberg uses a bit more of his 'Traffic' style this time around with our desperate band of thieves. The hand held shots and strange angles are an attempt to provide interest to an otherwise boring project. I firmly believe Soderberg makes these movies to keep his friendships and power so that he can make the films he really wants to make. At least I hope that is why. Twelve tosses in a few more cute cameos than Eleven with Topher Grace, Albert Finney, Bruce Willis and even Jerry Weintraub making appearances. However, watching Julia Roberts play Julia Roberts is more painful than silly. The only interesting character is Vincent Cassel as Toulour, who wants to be known as the best thief. The scene in the museum is a Hip-Hop version of Catherine Zeta-Jones from 'Entrapment'. This is our second story line behind Andy Garcia seeking payback and revenge for the gang's successful hit on his casino in Eleven. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the new addition, but provides little more than another perfect face and wardrobe. Otherwise same old, same old and if you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy this one. Just remember, Elvis would have fit right in.",6,0,3,12 December 2004
Crash," Missed the touch
","Greetings again from the darkness. Within the first 5 minutes, I was shifting in my seat and realized the dialog was making me extremely uncomfortable. My first reaction was that writer/director Paul Haggis (writer of 'Million Dollar Baby', TV's 'L.A. Law' 'Thirtysomething' and 'Walker, Texas Ranger') was using simple shock value to manipulate the audience on the topic of racism. The words and scenarios were almost cartoonish. As the movie went on, I realized this was very much an expose on the stereotypes and paranoia we all carry. Bigotry and intolerance and fear are widespread. Of course, very few of us wear it on our sleeves or are as indignant about it as most of the characters in the film, but Haggis is right in that this is not a subtle topic. Bust it open and examine it and MAYBE something good will happen.The cast is huge and talented. Sandra Bullock, shaking off her 'Miss Congeniality' persona, does great work in her limited screen time as the eternally angry princess who has refused to reflect. Don Cheadle turns in another of his sterling roles as the moralistic protector of all things good, only this time he has some demons of his own. Matt Dillon, in her first good performance since 'Drugstore Cowboy', is terrific and steals most every scene. His character is the most complex, hated, misunderstood tough guy you have seen in awhile. The rest of the cast is filled out wonderfully by Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard (Gossie in 'Ray'), Larenz Tate (Quincy Jones in 'Ray'), Tony Danza, Keith David, Ryan Phillipe and Thandie Newton. Ludicrous deserves special mention for stepping up and playing the absolute most extreme racist (with a touch of humor) since Peter Boyle in 'Monster's Ball'.There will be many comparisons to PT Anderson's great film 'Magnolia' due to the overlapping story lines and criss-crossing of characters and I feel the spiritualism of the film can also be related to Kasdan's 'Grand Canyon'.",8,2,11,8 May 2005
Snatch," Stealing On and Off Screen
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Madonna's hubby is no dummy.  He steals from the best.  The influence of Tarantino is obvious, but in 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' I see a great deal of Scorcese as well.  When you learn from these two and throw in a twisted, darkly comical screenplay and amazing acting from the ensemble cast, Guy Ritchie provides us with this years best guilty pleasure!  I found myself alterately laughing and squirming with the unique mix of violence and a remarkably high number of scenes where at least one character is asking himself, 'What am I doing here?'.  Alan Ford steals his scenes as Brick Top - a perfect name for such a charming guy.  Brad Pitt turns in a beautiful performance as a character right out of the Paul Bunyon school of Tall Tales.  Although brief in screen time, Benicio Del Toro again shows why he is well on his way to stardom.  I just hope he continues to be very selective on his roles and doesn't turn in to Kevin Bacon, god forbid.  No real tidbit on this other than make sure to enjoy the dialogue.  It is, for the most part, easily understood if one concentrates.  I did not find it to be a distraction, and I am from TEXAS! Looking forward to more from Guy Ritchie, but I do hope he learns to minimize the visual distractions (clever camera work) to the point that it does not interfere with the story.",8,0,0,22 January 2001
BlacKkKlansman," a good one from Spike
","Greetings again from the darkness. Adam Driver impersonating John David Washington or vice versa ... either way is comical, except that it's also based on a true story where their characters existed and this chain of events actually occurred. The source material is the memoir by Ron Stallworth and it's possible, given today's social climate, that only director Spike Lee could pull off a film that so blatantly uses racism for comedic effect, yet also reminds us of its inherent danger. Mr. Washington (Denzel's son) plays Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first black rookie police officer. His job interview is quite awkward and, of course, features a reference to Jackie Robinson. Quickly growing tired of his records room duty, Stallworth's first field assignment is to infiltrate a local black activist group and report back on a Stokely Carmichael/Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) event. This leads to a much bigger and riskier plan of going after the KKK. Yes that's right, no need to re-read the part about him being the first black police officer. This is the incredible story of how an African-American (with the help of his white partner) worked his way into the KKK, even speaking with David Duke on a few occasions, and ultimately prevented an attack on local black activists.The adapted screenplay was a collaborative effort from Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, and director Spike Lee. The film is simultaneously laugh outloud funny and provocative. The outlandish plan involves Ron Stallworth (and his white voice) being the telephone connection, and partner (and non-practicing Jew) Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) being the 'white face' of Ron Stallworth at KKK meetings. There is extreme tension during Zimmerman's undercover scenes, and much of the humor occurs during Stallworth's phone conversations. Topher Grace is extremely effective as David Duke, a thankless role to say the least.Superb support work is widespread in this film that runs 2 hour and 15 minutes. Robert John Burke plays a no-nonsense Chief Bridges; Frederick Weller is racist jackass patrolman Andy Landers; Laura Harrier is Patrice, the Angela Davis lookalike activist and love interest; Jasper Paakkonen plays skeptical and high-strung Klansman Felix; Paul Walter Hauser (I, TONYA) is the comical and unnerving Ivanhoe; and even Harry Belafonte makes a surprise big screen appearance. Other notables include Alec Baldwin (in an opening that sets the stage), Nicholas Turturro, Damaris Lewis, Ryan Eggold, Isiah Whitlock Jr, and Arthur J Nascarella. It's a terrific and deep cast and they walk the fine line between entertainment and enlightenment. There is no shortage of Hollywood family genes and blending thanks to: Washington, Baldwin, Turturro, Buscemi, and Weller (it plays like 2 degrees of separation).A low-budget look to the film gives it an authenticity and 1970's vibe, and cinematographer Chayse Irvin works wonders with the camera in a multitude of situations where our attention should be on the dialogue of the characters rather than the colorfulness of set pieces. Black Ron running the show from a telephone (and a white voice) and White Ron face-first in the muck both have their burdens to bear, and much of the time, Zimmerman's is the more interesting of the two - although as a whole, it's an astonishing story.Perhaps Spike Lee set out to make the polar opposite of D.W. Griffith's 1915 most controversial film THE BIRTH OF A NATION, and he has certainly crafted one of the most effective films of his oeuvre. He also nails a few jabs at Trump and the current political climate, while the music from Terrence Blanchard perfectly complements the tone. Mr. Lee interjects some historic moments as well as some fictional ones - none more powerful than the back and forth chants of 'White Power' 'Black Power'. At the conclusion, Lee serves up footage of Charlottesville, reminding us that the racism that caused us chuckles over the past couple of hours, remains prevalent today ... only that's not the least bit funny.",8,24,50,10 August 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Grain Alcohol and Rainwater
","Greetings again from the darkness. Difficult to decide if it's more shocking that this film is almost 50 years old, or that it ever got released in the first place. No other black comedy satire on such a sensitive political issue has ever had its theatrical release right smack dab in the middle of the ongoing issue. The cold war between Russia and the US was in high gear and the Cuban Missile crisis had just occurred. In fact, President Kennedy's assassination caused the film's opening to be delayed.Stanley Kubrick only directed eleven feature length films, and ten of them can be considered classics (A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, to name a few). Dr. Strangelove is regarded as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, though it's difficult to imagine anyone under 30 really 'getting' much of the humor - unless they happen to be a history buff. The movie could come across as one big 'inside joke' to those unfamiliar with the times.Loosely based on Peter George's 'Red Alert' novel, Kubrick decided to take the source material and turn it into satire. He brought in Terry Southern (The Magic Christian) to help with the script, and then he turned the incomparable Peter Sellers loose in 3 roles (originally 4, but he broke his leg and gave up the Commander King Kong role). Stories abound with Sellers causing multiple takes and significant editing due to his ad-libbing cracking up other cast members (and even Kubrick).The structure of the film involved three separate, yet intertwined sequences. We see Burpelson Air Force Base Commander General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) issuing the order to Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) to lock down the base. It turns out, Ripper has gone a bit loony and somehow issued the strike first command against Russia. Mandrake spends much of this segment trying to calmly obtain the Recall Codes from Ripper. We also meet the crew of one of the multiple B-52 bombers in route to Russia. Led by Commander 'King' Kong (Slim Pickins), they are on the way to deliver two nuclear bombs. One of his crew is played by James Earl Jones in his screen debut. Lastly we go inside the War Room where President Merkin Muffley (Sellers) is meeting with his Joint Chiefs of Staff and advisors. A key player here is General Buck Turgidson (George C Scott) in full kill and be killed mode.There are so many interesting bits to discuss, but let's limit to just a few. Watch the camera angles that Kubrick uses to film Hayden. He is made to look both powerful and nuts. Hayden (so great in Kubrick's The Killing) has the voice and tough guy stance to make us believe he could start a war due to a Russian plot to pollute the 'precious body fluids' of Americans. Sellers plays two roles in the War Room, but his straight man performance as the President allows George C Scott to really shine in one of his few comedic turns as an actor. Scott's performance is somehow over the top AND right on the button (so to speak). When watching Slim Pickins in the iconic final image, keep in mind that he was a real life rodeo cowboy prior to breaking into acting.Obviously the character names are outlandish (Keenan Wynn plays Col. Bat Guano), but it should be noted that the character of the President was based on real life politician and Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. The General Turgidson character is based on real life General Curtis LeMay who was infamous for his kill 'em first attitude. Also, General Ripper was based on General Thomas S Power, who was LeMay's protégé and ultimate replacement as Joint Chief of the Air Force. It should also be noted that Tracy Reed is the only female character who appears ... and yes, that is her in the Playboy magazine that Commander Kong is perusing.There are so many classic lines and sight gags in the film that it's challenging to keep up on the first viewing. Also, it's been a few years since a pay phone and coke machine played such vital roles. When Kubrick killed the original pie fight ending, he added more frightening images and the poignant closing song - 'We'll Meet Again' by Vera Lynn. The last note is that director Sidney Lumet did a film version of this same basic story told in a straight-forward and thrilling manner. His 'Fail-Safe' was released less than a year after Dr. Strangelove.",9,2,5,2 November 2012
The Expendables," My Friend loves playing in the Jungle
","Greetings again from the darkness. The most difficult movies to comment on are those in which even the filmmakers don't take themselves seriously. Here, Stallone creates a movie with his tongue firmly planted in his plastic surgery enhanced cheek. It is a bit goofy and meant to be so. The good stuff is actually pretty good, but the stuff that misses the mark is a bit painful to watch.The good stuff includes the already infamous cameo scene with Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It has the single best line (maybe two) in the movie and it's just great to see Arnie back on screen. The other funny thing is the character names: Barney, Christmas, Ying Yang, Gunner, James Munroe, Toll Road, Paine, Hale Caeser, and of course, Tool. More work went into the character names than the balance of the script.The parts that don't work include the lame one-liners that Jason Statham is forced to recite throughout. Also, Stallone remains in love with his own face after all these years. I believe he is off screen for a total of 3 minutes. And enough with the Jet Li short jokes. One was plenty. We could have really used more of Terry Crews. He lights up the screen when he starts his trail of destruction.Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin, Eric Roberts, Randy Couture and David Zayas all have their moments. But therein lies the problem. Just can't do justice to so many characters ... or is it caricatures? This one is exactly what it was meant to be. Don't expect the world's greatest action film. Think of it as more of a Tribute Film with non-stop stunts. Oh and a blasting version of Mississippi Queen by Mountain with Leslie West.",6,2,8,19 August 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Fairies, A Faun, A Frog and a Fussy Dandy
","Greetings again from the darkness. From the creatively warped mind of writer/director Guillermo del Toro ('Cronos','Mimic','Hellboy') comes a for-adults-fantasy that resembles 'Alice in Wonderland' on steroids.The strong point of the film is when young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) explores the fantastical underground world that the fairies lead her to. The effects are somewhat comical at times, but also chilling in their realism. Two other nice performances are by Sergi Lopez as the quite merciless Captain and Maribel Verdu (so wonderful in 'Y tu Mama Tambien') as Mercedes.What prevents this from being the masterpiece so many are intent on it becoming is, of course, the story itself. The underground world segments are fascinating and unique and spell-binding. Where the film lags is in the real world with the guerrillas in the forest and the odd military post that the evil Captain rules. While having a touch of 'Cinderella' and 'Alice in Wonderland', parents should be aware that it is in no way intended for young children.The visual strength of the mystical fantasy world make this one worth seeing, but it definitely doesn't reach the level of classic or masterpiece.",9,0,1,14 January 2007
Knocked Up," Just Do It Already
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'Freaks and Geeks' lives on through multiple tie-ins - not the least of which is writer/director and producer Judd Apatow (best known for his smash hit '40 Year Old Virgin'). This is a sharp comedy and cutting insight thanks to a terrific script, excellent comedic timing from Seth Rogen and Apatow's feel for a scene.Rogen plays Ben Stone, a slacker who spends all his time smoking pot with his friends and conceptualizing an 'informational' web site. One evening, while hanging with his buds in a club, he stumbles onto a ridiculously beautiful and ripe for the taking Katherine Heigl (Izzie from Grey's Anatomy). One thing leads to another and the next thing we know Heigl's character, Alison, is knocked up.It would be easy to classify this as a slapstick comedy in the mode of 'Wedding Crashers', but in fact, Apatow's script offers up some insightful commentary on marriage, family and relationships of all types. Apatow's real life wife, Leslie Mann, plays Heigl's sister who dreams of the perfect marriage, but is crushed when she discovers her husband's secret (not what you think). Mann's 'cheating' husband is played brilliantly by Paul Rudd ... who flashes a very nice DeNiro impersonation.The only weaknesses of the film are the shortage of scenes between Heigl and Rogen, and the fact that the film probably lasts 15 minutes too long. The whole Las Vegas sequence could have been cut. Still, this is not your typical comedy and please be prepared for some harsh (and loud) language and some very graphic visuals ... it is rated R for more than one reason! Apatow is creating his own look and feel and shows flashes of brilliant comedy writing. He could challenge the Cohen Brothers in the near future for the throne of off-beat comedy. Don't miss the fine songs from Loudon Wainwright III - especially the one playing over the closing credits.",8,110,197,25 April 2007
The Book Thief," People Being People
","Greetings again from the darkness. You may be familiar with the source material - the huge best selling novel from Markus Zusak. If not, you may be surprised at the 'through the eyes' of an illiterate, orphaned child's perspective of the German home front during WWII. You may be more surprised to learn that it's narrated by The Grim Reaper (British actor Roger Allam), and includes a Nazi rally, book-burning, bomb shelters, a look at the anti-Jew and anti-Communist movements, the German conscription/military draft and the dangers associated with hiding a Jew in one's basement.There is no denying the melodramatic nature of the story, but this one avoids schmaltz thanks to the remarkable performances of the great Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, and especially Sophie Nelisse as the incredibly perceptive Liesel who provides the innocence and powers of observation that prove to us (and Death) that good people will do extraordinary things no matter the atrocious conditions.As Liesel's foster parents, Rush plays a warm-hearted WWI veteran and Watson plays a cantankerous, grounded woman hiding the emotion she carries for her husband and new daughter. The biggest piece of hiding involves Max, a young Jewish man who is the son of a soldier who once saved the life of Rush's character. Max and Liesel have a wonderful bond as he teaches her to speak through her eyes and she nurses him back to health by sharing her new found joy of reading.The ghost of the boy who lived in the shadows ... from H.G. Wells 'The Invisible Man' plays a key role as Liesel tries to make sense of a world that delivers a daily dose of relentless danger. As she develops her love and dependence on the written word, it's clear that to survive in these times, one must have something that provides hope. The unusual story structure with the odd narrator, and a mix of wry humor, keep us connected with the characters and allow the humanity to shine through. Still, I challenge you to watch this without a lump in your throat. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com",7,8,18,30 November 2013
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," There's a Hole in the World
","Greetings again from the darkness. Upfront admission ... I am a huge Tim Burton fan. I think he is a film genius. Unlike many, however, I don't believe this is his best work. Still, it is incredibly creative and stylish. It's just missing something.For a musical, the lead voices are mediocre at best. Rickman is barely passable. Young Ed Sanders who plays Toby had far and away the most impressive voice, while newcomer Jayne Wisener (Johanna) has such a high pitch that it made me wish for her parakeet to chirp instead. Depp and Bonham Carter are OK, but one expects stronger vocals for a Stephen Sondheim production.Be prepared for an overdose of spurting blood, but there is enough comic distraction to offset. Sacha Baron Cohen has a funny bit as a con man/ competing barber and Timothy Spall is just so funny looking that you can't help but chuckle whenever his ugly mug hits the screen.Still not sure what was missing here, but I felt it falls short of greatness despite the amazing visual feast of Bonham Carter's dream. Of course it goes without saying that the great Sondheim songs are pure brilliance. His talent is so unique when compared to most Broadway production numbers.",7,0,4,23 December 2007
Black Mass," Cops and Robbers, Southie Style
","Greetings again from the darkness. Movie goers tend to fall into one of two groups when it comes to Johnny Depp – big fans or denigrators. Whichever side of the line you fall, there are few actors who can claim such a diverse career of on screen characters ranging from Edward Scissorhands to Gilbert Grape; from Donnie Brasco to Captain Jack Sparrow; from Willy Wonka to Sweeney Todd; and from John Dillinger to Tonto. Depp now turns his talents towards one of the most unsympathetic real life characters imaginable  South Boston's infamous crime lord James 'Whitey' Bulger.Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) proves yet again that he is an actor's director, rather than a visual technician or story addict. In this adaptation of the book from 'Boston Globe' reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, Cooper has Depp and Joel Edgerton as his two leads, and an incredibly deep supporting cast that provide the look and feel for this period piece dramatizing the crime and corruption during Bulger's reign.When one thinks of the memorable kingpins of crime/gangster movies, those that come to mind include Michael Corleone (The Godfather movies), Tony Montana (Scarface), Jimmy Conway (Goodfellas), and Frank Costello (The Departed). The Costello character was supposedly partially inspired by Bulger. What made each of these characters fascinating to watch was the insight we were given into the psychological make-up of each and the inner-workings of their organization. And that's the disappointment of Cooper's film.For the Whitey Bulger story, there are two distinct directions to explore: the building of Bulger's criminal empire, or the motivation of the FBI Agent John Connolly (Edgerton) as he juggled his job and relationship with Bulger. Unfortunately, the approach here is to show a hand full of cold-blooded murders to prove Bulger's management style, and a few FBI meetings that show the obvious uncertainty within the agency. Rather than a muddled mash-up, a more interesting movie would have chosen a path and dug in deeply.Despite the story issues, it is fun to watch how Depp and Edgerton tackle their roles. Under heavy make-up (wrinkles, receding hairline, hillbilly teeth, and crazy contact lenses), Depp becomes the intimidating force of Whitey Bulger. Just as impressive is Edgerton as Agent Connolly, as we witness the Southie neighborhood boys all grown up, but still playing cops and robbers  and it remains difficult to tell who the good guys from the bad. Edgerton's cockiness and strutting capture the ego and ambition necessary for a federal agent to bend so many rules. In fact, despite the vastly different approaches, it's not entirely clear which of these two fellows possesses the greatest ambition.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother who became a State Senator. We get very few scenes featuring the brothers, and in fact, Cumberbath's best scenes are instead shared with Edgerton. It's difficult not to chuckle at their first meeting in a restaurant as we watch a Brit and Aussie talk it out with south Boston accents. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott play Edgerton's fellow FBI agents, while Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane (especially good) and W Earl Brown make terrific Bulger crew members. Peter Sarsgaard leaves quite the impression as a doped-up associate, while Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple provide the film's minimal female presence. Corey Stoll storms onto the screen as a Federal Prosecutor who is not amused by the relationship between Connolly and Bulger, but this movie belongs to Depp and Edgerton.The concern is that any viewer not already familiar with the Whitey Bulger story may find the story not overly interesting, despite the terrific performances. Fortunately, this viewer was mesmerized by last year's exceptional documentary entitled Whitey: United States of America v James J Bulger  a must see for anyone who wants full details into the Bulger reign of crime and terror, as well as his 20 years on the lam.",7,9,16,19 September 2015
Nacho Libre," A Man of Science
","Greetings again from the darkness. The husband and wife Hess team's follow-up to the smash cult hit 'Napoleon Dynamite' is a free fall to mediocrity. Lacking the multitude of funny/interesting characters, 'Nacho Libre' is little more than a comic vehicle for the very talented Jack Black to spout his poorly written lines with a fake Spanish accent and run around shirtless in the world's worst wrestling costume (with stretchy pants).Since it is written purely as a comedy, no mention should be made of the political incorrectness ... astral, that is what comedy is based on. The sad thing is, the Hess team and the usually great Mike White have tried to pass off the script as first rate comedy, when actually it is for the most part, just plain boring.Relative newcomer Ana de la Reguera is beautiful and pulls off the angelic nun role with ease, but Peter Stormare is woefully miscast as some sort of mystical guru. No other characters are even worth mentioning. Weak writing and casting make for a way-too-few-laughs comedy.",5,1,2,18 June 2006
The Ottoman Lieutenant," romance and revisionist history
","Greetings again from the darkness. A story of romance smack dab in the middle of war is always a bit risky and sometimes difficult to sell. Make it a love triangle and toss in distinct religious differences, and if it's not a mess, it'll do till the mess gets here (a sentiment borrowed from the Coen Brothers).This is director Joseph Ruben's first feature since The Forgotten (2004), and he's also known for Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), the breakout dramatic role for Julia Roberts after Pretty Woman. The film is written by Jeff Stockwell, who is best known for Bridge to Terabithia (2007), and the script leans heavily on melodrama while also sprinkling in some acts of war.Hera Hilmar (who favors Abbie Cornish) stars as Lillie Rowe, a head-strong free-thinking nurse living a life of privilege in 1914 Philadelphia, but committed to an ideal of justice for all. She meets a handsome and equally idealistic Dr Jude Gresham (Josh Hartnett) who is fundraising for his hospital located in the remote hills of Turkey. Circumstances are such that a Turkish officer is assigned to escort Lillie to Gresham's hospital. As if enough sparks haven't already flown between Jude and Lillie, it's pretty clear that the attraction between her and Ismail (an excellent Michiel Huisman, 'Game of Thrones') is even stronger. The fourth key character here is Jude's partner, Dr. Woodruff (Sir Ben Kingsley), whose immediate dislike of Lillie is quickly dispensed once she exhibits her medical competency.Lillie is warned  war is coming. It's WWI and it's the Muslim Ottoman Empire vs the Christian Armenians. To label this revisionist history is an understatement. The 1915 Armenian Genocide is only alluded to with passing mention that the Ottomans 'took steps' to control the Armenians. Even in such a lightweight and hokey melodrama, an omission like that jumps out. Whether it's selective memory or outright propaganda, it seems obvious that the Turkish financiers were hoping to make a political/historical statement hidden behind a romantic triangle wrapped in war. The sweeping score by Geoff Zanelli and the beautiful cinematography of Daniel Aranyo both emphasize the romance aspects, while minimizing the fighting and cultural clashes.",4,84,219,10 March 2017
The Town," Monster of Green
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ben Affleck proved himself to be a talented director with 'Gone Baby Gone'. Here, he once again shows he is best suited behind the camera. He has a real feel for setting, scenery, actors and camera angles. Unfortunately, this story based on the Chuck Hogan novel 'Prince of Thieves' is just a bit too formulaic to stand out from the crowd.We are told upfront that the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown has more bank robbers than any other ... in fact, in some families it is a proud tradition, passed on to the next generation. Ben Affleck got the guide book from his dad - an incarcerated Chris Cooper who has only one scene, though it's very dramatic. Affleck's lifelong pal and crime partner is played by Jeremy Renner. Renner's character, Jem, is downright psychotic to Affleck's Mr. Sensitive. If after 'Hurt Locker' you have a difficult time imagining Renner as a bad guy, you should check out 'North Country'. That's a very bad man.As seen in the preview, Affleck's merry band of bank robbers take a hostage played by Rebecca Hall ('Vicky Cristina Barcelona'). Affleck, in the course of duty, falls for Hall. She is the light that shows him the way to a better life. Unfortunately, that story line leads us right back to more crime ... with FBI mad man Jon Hamm hot on the heals of the local bad boys.The neighborhood crime lord, played superbly by Pete Postlethwaite, controls the every move of the gang and takes his 'fair' share while leading through intimidation - all while trimming roses! Renner's sister and Affleck's previous squeeze is played alarmingly (and surprisingly) well by Blake Lively. She appears to have a nice little career ahead of her.The frustrating thing with this film is that we have seen it all before, just without the heavy bean-town accents. Tons of automatic weaponry lead to very few actual injuries or deaths - always the sign of a cheesy shootout. The finale for Renner, Hall and Affleck are all advertised well in advance of the actual occurrence, which pretty much ends the suspense. On the bright side, the film is well made and entertaining enough. For a much better film on the culture of local/family crime check out 'Animal Kingdom'.",6,12,24,19 September 2010
Closer," We're Happy ... Aren't we?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Surprisingly little good to be said about the horrible film from highly acclaimed director Mike Nichols ('The Graduate' HBO's 'Angels in America', 'Working Girl'). Known for his ability to capture human nature, often with comic overtures, Nichols fails to deliver either in this psychotic, twisted film that watches like a play and conjures up memories of the unlikable folks from Nichols 'Carnal Knowledge'.The topic is sex and love and the talk is more than frank ... it is presented to shock. This is not your normal Julia Roberts movie, which should be a good thing, but isn't. Jude Law plays a sniveling little wimp and Clive Owen ('King Arthur') is a conniving 'cave man' (his character's words). The only actor who delivers any substance at all is Natalie Portman in her scene at the airport hotel towards the end. Trust me when I tell you, don't see this one with your mom or your kids ... and best to avoid it altogether.",3,2,4,4 December 2004

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Jon Favreau (the greatness of 'Swingers', also the doctor in 'Elf') provides the seasons first touch of holiday spirit.  Will Ferrell is perfect as the wanna-be/thought-I-was six foot three elf.  This film works because it has a nice little story (actually a couple of them) that provide the framework for some classic comedy scenes.  The VERY attractive and talented Zooey Deschanel ('the Good Girl' 'Mumford') is very good as Buddy's co-worker and friend.  I am looking forward to seeing just how good of an actress she will become.  She has the look to play a love interest or the bad guy/girl role.  A wonderful supporting cast helps make this one work.  James Caan as the Scrooge character and Ed Asner as Santa are both perfect, as is Bob Newhart as Ferrell's adopted elf father.  The key role of Caan's son/Ferrell's brother Michael is played well by Daniel Tay (played Harvey Pekar as a kid in one of this year's best films 'American Splendor').  Also nice to see Peter Dinklage (from another of this year's best films 'The Station Agent') in a bizarre, yet brief role as an angry, children's writer for hire.  This is definitely one you can take the whole family to.  There were kids in the audience from ages 2 to 80.  Go with the Christmas spirit, as this is not Shakespeare!",8,0,2,9 November 2003
Shutter Island," Rat in a Maze
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh yes, the psychological thriller is my favorite movie genre. Not sure what that says about me. There are so few good ones, at least since Alfred Hitchcock passed on. Director Martin Scorsese often includes some psychological warfare in his films, but with 'Shutter Island', he leaps feet first into the world of the criminally insane.This is a very difficult film to comment on because it is crucial that the viewer watch with a clean slate ... in other words, don't let someone toss out some spoilers if you plan to see the film. All I will say regarding the story is that it's fun to watch and my brain was working non-stop the whole time (that's a good thing!). Scorcese uses many different camera angles, close-ups and bright red to go with the island storm. The film has some of the style of his Cape Fear, but even more darkness to the story, as here, EVERY character is a bit off center.Scorsese has, as usual, assembled an excellent cast. Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead as Teddy. His partner is played by Mark Ruffalo and they 'investigate' the disappearance of a patient from Shutter Island - a treatment center for the criminally insane. This is no vacation island and at the center is a civil war fort that houses the worst of the worst. The creepy place is run by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, who could both make afternoon English Tea seem downright ominous.The cast is so strong that Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are basically limited to one scene each and Jackie Earle Haley continues his resurgence with a wicked one on one scene with Leo. Michelle Williams makes her appearances via flashbacks, visions and sweaty, late night dreams. By the end of the film, her ugly yellow dress was itself a frightening prop.To cap off the mental and emotional turmoil, Scorsese adds an unusual score that at first seems overbearing at odd times, but later reveals itself to have been 'right' all along. My favorite shot of the film is at the very beginning when the ferry first breaks through the fog. Funny enough, it was ME in a fog for the next 2 hours!",8,3,6,20 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Shall We Play a Game?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Many were unimpressed with the first Captain America movie, though I have always had a soft spot for the most heroic and genuinely pure of the superheroes. This sequel opens with Steve Rogers trying to acclimate after a 70 year sleep ... he thinks the internet is pretty cool. It is a bit surprising that the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe, known for You, Me and Dupree) are the ones who load up on plot lines within a Marvel movie.Starting off with big time action sequences, the movie then morphs into a geopolitical weave of intrigue between SHIELD and HYDRA. New to this maze of distrust is Robert Redford ... proving once again that Hollywood doesn't trust guys wearing suits in fancy offices. In a twist, Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves the target of a manhunt by those they work for. Then they drag The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) into this ... his flight suit is a nice effect. All of this happens after an unexpected action-packed sequence featuring Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson).The multiple plot lines and emphasis on trust issues all correlate pretty well to some of the things going on in the world today. That adds an enjoyable element that really brings relevance to the Captain America character. Because of this the repartee between Cap and Natasha is limited ... we get some, but much less than what we have come to expect from other Avengers-related films. And it's probably a good idea to go a different direction with the Avenger who really is different from the others. Don't miss the extra scene in the closing credits ... it's the lead in to The Avengers movie coming in 2015.",7,0,2,20 April 2014
Capote," The Book I was Always Meant to Write
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is a powerful, mesmerizing, disquieting film. It is the fascinating story of a fascinating story. For those of us old enough to remember Truman Capote, it is chilling to see his reincarnation through Phillip Seymour Hoffman. For those of us who have read Capote's book 'In Cold Blood', it is gut-wrenching to witness some of what brought the book to life. For lovers of film, this one is a must see.Hoffman has spent years building an impressive resume in Hollywood, ranging from exceptional support work ('Scent of a Woman' 'Twister') to underrated indie leads ('Owning Mahoney' 'Love Liza'). He is a craftsman and artist, an actor's actor. His turn as Capote transcends anything he has ever done. This is no impersonation. While watching the movie, we forget he is an actor. He is Capote as we become lost in the story.The essence of the film is Capote's bizarre attraction to one of the two men accused of the brutal slaying of a rural Kansas family. Much speculation has occurred over Capote's relationship with Perry Smith, but make no mistake, it led to his most important work and probably his lost soul.Director Bennett Miller does a nice job of letting the character and story speak. No fancy camera stuff. Capote poses and alternates between the torn character visiting Smith in prison and the master celebrity holding court with the 'in' New York crowd.Catherine Keener turns in some fine support work as Nelle Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend and the writer of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Ms. Lee's story could make a fine film as her life as a recluse rivals that of J.D. Salinger. One must wonder of the collaborative efforts of Lee and Capote.Not a film for everyone, but it is definitely for those who enjoy the highest quality acting within a remarkable story line.",9,2,5,20 October 2005
Life of Pi," Big Tiger, Small Boat
","Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we are reminded of just how stunning movies can be. Periodically a filmmaker proves to us that pushing the envelope of creativity still drives some auteurs. James Cameron brought us Avatar, which demonstrated that 3D technology could be beautiful and breath-taking. As beautiful and new as Cameron's breakthrough was, it lacked a story worthy of it advancements. Now, we get director Ang Lee's vision of Yann Martel's worldwide bestseller, and we are left gasping at what happens when you combine a fantastical story with technological advances and perfection.Ang Lee has provided us with a varied selection of films including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain; and Sense and Sensibility. He refuses to be limited by genre and takes a global and philosophical view of filmmaking. He wants us to think and discuss and think some more. His Life of Pi film purposefully leaves many scenes, events and thoughts open to interpretation. You can see as much or as little of humanity in this story as you like.The brilliant opening shows real animals in the real zoo located in Pondicherry, India. The colors, sights and sounds are dazzling and give us an immediate feel for the area. We meet young Pi and his family. Pi is inquisitive and ingenious from an early age. His father imparts such wisdom as 'If you believe in everything, you believe in nothing'. This comes as Pi is absorbing multiple religions and considers himself Hindu/Muslim/Christian. At an early age, he seeks answers and meaning. Soon enough, Pi and his family take their most valued animals on a ship to Canada. Disaster strikes when a storm capsizes the ship and Pi is the lone human survivor. He finds himself in a small lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, and a huge Bengal tiger.The developments need not be discussed here, but rather the focus of the story is the spirit of survival that Pi possesses. His ingenious methods of learning to coexist with the ferocious tiger force us to consider what the human race has done to nature in too many regards to count. Pi's religious spirit and insightful ways, coupled with a very specific survival guide, lead him to maneuver 227 days adrift in the Pacific. In the process, we are treated to some of the most spectacular visuals ever seen on screen. At times the sea, and its sea life and sky, are phosphorescent. The story is so amazing that we find ourselves not caring how much is real and how much is caused by Pi's hunger and thirst. Some of the visual effects are tranquil, while others are quite violent. A sequence featuring flying silver fish is something to behold.The structure of the story is such that an adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) is re-telling the tale of survival to a Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). While this is a traditional story-telling device, it takes nothing away from the anything but traditional story of Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's name). We are told 'This is a story that will make you believe in God'. Whether it does or it doesn't, it certainly makes us believe in the magic of movies.Some will compare to Castaway, while others will think of 127 Hours. My best advice is to let go and give yourself to the story and the film. There is always time afterwards for debate and discussion. Instead, enjoy the moment and be thankful that a movie like this can get made ... it will lead the industry to even more creative productions down the road. So, just this once, forget what I have said many times, and go see this one in 3D. Allow it to take you away.",8,4,8,26 November 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," You can Bank on it
","Greetings again from the darkness. Every bit as good as the first one, and far superior to 12 ... the only thing missing is the excitement of a new franchise. Director Steven Soderbergh and all the familiar smirking faces are back, as is the colorful wardrobe.With a look and feel very similar to the ultra-cool first one with Sinatra and Martin, Thirteen is back at home in Vegas where the franchise belongs. This time the revenge is aimed at mega-sleaze ball Al Pacino, who screws over Ellott Gould for his share of the hottest new casino in Vegas. The boys aren't happy about this and, of course, what comes next is an elaborate plan that only someone as genius as George Clooney and Brad Pitt could truly comprehend. Anyway, it is fun to watch Pacino do what he loves ... chew his scenes with vigor.The other new face is that of Ellen Barkin, in her return to the big screen after her billionaire divorce. I for one, enjoyed having her sit and home counting money and cringed to hear she would be back on screen. Luckily she is given little to do other than wear a tight dress and act drugged around Matt Damon.The smarm is on full display as Pitt and Clooney continue to finish each other's sentences and the best scenes utilize Soderbegh's quick edits to capture the fine timing of all boys and their assignments. Even Andy Garcia is back and joins in the revenge plot with a twist of his own. As is customary, each of the boys gets their own little moment of spotlight, some to more success than others. It is nice to see Vincent Cassell (the only good thing about 12) back, if only for a brief visit.Overall, this hits what it swings at, and is nothing more or nothing less than we would expect from these pros who show up every three years to have some fun and get paid. Undoubtedly, there will be another in the series, as they have the process down to a science and they receive a nice pay day. Small price to pay for a fun popcorn flick.",7,1,4,10 June 2007
Lost in Translation," A Visual Masterpiece
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Sofia Coppola has created a true piece of visual art.  She has a gift of telling a story with very dialog.  Her shots of Scarlett Johannsen (who is outstanding) looking over the Tokyo skyline from her hotel window are wonderful, as are the 'peeping tom' shots of her exploring this fascinating world.  Of course, what really makes this film work is the hound dog look and mannerisms of Bill Murray. He has the ability to appear ALMOST beaten by life, but still have a gleam of hope in his eyes and on his face.  The scenes between the two lead have very little dialog, yet speak volumes for many in the audience.  So many looking for who they are or what they are meant to be.  The lifelong quest we all face.  Did think maybe the marriage between Giovanni Ribisi and Scarlett could have been handled a little differently, but we do understand her pain.  On the other hand, we never see Bill Murray's wife, but have a total understanding of his desire for more.  Coppola uses windows and television to great effect as the two leads are always looking for something to connect with.  This is real life touched with humor and sadness. Johannsen has 4 films coming out over the next year and I anxiously await each to see how she progresses as an actress.  And Sofia Coppola has won my admiration for her talent and I will be first in line with her next project. Last thing, I know it is difficult to watch Bill Murray sing karoake without flashing back to his SNL days, but these are poignant moments and should not be spoiled by his baggage.",8,0,1,22 September 2003
Interstellar," Rave at Close of Day
","Greetings again from the darkness. There are probably three distinct groups that view this as a 'must see' movie. First, there are the hardcore science lovers – especially those dedicated to space and time. Next would be the core group of Sci-Fi aficionados (those who quote and debate the specifics of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, The Matrix, etc). And finally, those cinephiles who anxiously await the next ground-breaking film of director Christopher Nolan, whose experimental and pioneering methods are quite unique in today's Hollywood.Given that I would be laughed out of the first two groups – exposed as less than a neophyte, you may assume that my discussion of this film will not be steeped in scientific or astrophysical theorem. Instead, this will provide my reaction to what has been one of my two most anticipated films of the year (Birdman being the other).Simply stated, the look of this film is stunning and breath-taking. Its theatrical release comes in many formats, and I chose 70mm. This made for an incredibly rich look with probably the best sound mix I have ever heard. The physical sets were remarkable and as varied as the scene settings: a farm house, a NASA bunker, multiple spacecrafts, and numerous planets. Beyond that, we experienced the effects of blackholes, wormholes and the tesseract. Mr. Nolan's long time cinematographer and collaborator Wally Pfister was off directing his own film (Transcendence), so the very talented Hoyt Van Hoytema joined the team and contributed sterling camera work, including the first ever hand-held IMAX shots. Top this off with Hans Zimmer's complimentary (though sometimes manipulative) score, and Mr. Nolan has produced a technical marvel of which known adjectives lack justice.Take note of the exceptional cast led by the reigning Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyer's Club), and other Oscar winners and nominees Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, and Ellen Burstyn. Beyond these, we also have David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, William Devane, Topher Grace, David Gyasi, Collette Wolfe, Timothy Chalamet, and an exceptionally fine performance from Mackenzie Foy (who will forever be remembered as the Twilight child of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson).On the downside, I found myself shocked at some of the dubious and distracting dialogue. At times, the conversations were contradictory and even seemed out of place for the situation, character and movie. In particular, the entire Matt Damon sequence and the Anne Hathaway monologue on 'love' both struck me as disjointed and awkward. These and other minor annoyances can't be discussed here without noting key plot points, so that's where we will leave it. However, it must be mentioned that the words of Dylan Thomas are so oft repeated, that the phrase 'Do not go gently into that good night' can now be officially considered fighting words.The works of noted Theoretical Physicist Kip Thorne were the inspiration for the story, and even Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has come out in support of much of the science in the film. Be prepared for brain strain on topics such as space-time continuum (Einstein's Relative Study of Time), gravity, and the aforementioned wormholes, blackholes and tesseracts. The blight depicted in the first hour draws its look and even some closed circuit interviews directly from Ken Burns' documentary The Dust Bowl (2012). Beyond all of the science and lessons of human arrogance and survival, I found the story to be focused on loss  loss of home, loss of loved ones, loss of hope  and balanced by the remarkable human survival instinct. Christopher Nolan deserves much respect for addressing these human emotions and desires with the overwhelming vastness of space, and doing so in a time when Hollywood producers would much rather financially back the next superhero or even a sequel to a 20 year old comedy.",7,8,16,16 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," another McDonagh classic
","Greetings again from the darkness. Once out of our teen years (though some take a bit longer), the vast majority of us accept the obvious truth to the adage 'life is not fair'. Despite this, we never outgrow our desire for justice when we feel wronged. Uber- talented playwright/screenwriter/director Martin McDonagh delivers a superb drama blended with a type of dark comedy that allows us to deal with some pretty heavy, and often unpleasant small town happenings.Oscar winner Frances McDormand plays Mildred, a grieving mother whose daughter was abducted and violently murdered. With the case having gone cold, Mildred is beyond frustrated and now desperate to prevent her daughter from being forgotten. To light the proverbial fire and motivate the local police department to show some urgency in solving her daughter's case, Mildred uses the titular billboards to make her point and target the Police Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). The billboards cause quite the ruckus as the media brings extra attention, which in turn creates conflict between Mildred and the police department, the town citizens, and even her own son (Lucas Hedges). The film could have been titled 'The Wrath of Mildred' if not for so many other facets to the story and characters with their own layers. Her anger is certainly understandable, though some of her actions are impossible to defend. Things can never again be square in the life of a parent who has lost a child, yet vengeance is itself a lost cause.Mr. McDonagh's exceptional script utilizes twisted comedy to deal with the full spectrum of dark human emotions: managing the deepest grief, anger, guilt, and need for revenge. As in his Oscar winning script for the contemporary classic IN BRUGES (2008), his dialogue plays as a strange type of poetry, delivering some of the most harsh and profane lines in melodic fashion. In addition to his nonpareil wordsmithing, Mr. McDonagh and casting director Sarah Finn have done a remarkable job at matching many talented performers with the characters – both large roles and small. Following up her Emmy winning performance in 'Olive Kitteridge', Ms. McDormand is yet again a force of nature on screen. She would likely have dominated the film if not for the effectively understated portrayal by Mr. Harrelson, and especially the best supporting performance of the year courtesy of Sam Rockwell. His Officer Dixon is a racist with out-of-control anger issues who still lives with his mom (a brilliant Sandy Martin, who was also the grandma in NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE). Caleb Landry Jones once again shows his uncanny ability to turn a minor role into a character we can't take our eyes off (you'll remember his screen debut as one of the bike riding boys near the end of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Here he plays Red, the owner of the billboards with an inner desire to carry some clout. Rounding out the absurdly deep cast are Zeljko Ivanek, Kerry Condon, Lucas Hedges (MANCHESTER BY THE SEA), Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Abbie Cornish, and Clarke Peters (the epitome of a new Sheriff in town). Every actor has at least one moment (and monologue) to shine, and one of the best scenes (of the year) involves Nick Searcy as a Priest getting schooled on 'culpability' by Mildred.Cinematographer Ben Davis has a nice blend of 'big' movies (AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON) and small (TAMARA DREWE) in his career, and here he really captures the feel of the small town and interactions of the characters. Also adding to the film's excellence is the folksy, western score (with a touch of dueling gunfighters) by Carter Burwell. And keeping the streak alive  it's yet another worth-watching film featuring a Townes Van Zandt song.Not many films dare tackle the list of topics and issues that are touched on here: church arrogance, police violence, racism, cancer, domestic violence, questioning the existence of God, parental grief with a desire for revenge, the weight of a guilty conscience, and the influence of parents in a rural setting. The film is superbly directed by Mr. McDonagh, who now has delivered two true classics in less than a decade. It's the uncomfortable laughs that make life in Ebbing tolerable, but it's the pain and emotions that stick with us long after the credits roll. Sometimes we need a reminder that fairness in the world should not be expected, and likely does not exist. If that's true, what do we do with our anger? McDonagh offers no easy answers, because there are none. But he does want us to carefully consider our responses.",9,4,11,15 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," the end of the saga
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ending the final trilogy of trilogies that covers 42 years of storytelling, was never going to be easy. And, given the rabid fan base's backlash from the penultimate episode, the ending was unlikely to appease all (or even most?). Keeping respectful of the sensitivity associated with this franchise, no spoilers are included here, certainly nothing that hasn't already been dissected and debated after the trailers were released.As I approached the theatre, it was impossible not to chuckle at the irony of seeing the life-sized marketing prop for KNIVES OUT in the lobby. Of course, that current release is directed by Rian Johnson, who caused such an uproar with the aforementioned STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (Episode VIII), a franchise entry that happens to be one of my personal favorites. But we are here for Episode IX, the wrap-up of George Lucas' masterful vision. JJ Abrams (STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS) is back in the director's chair, and knowing what a fanboy he is, it's not surprising to see the familiarity and tributes to the franchise interjected throughout.In fact, this finale leans heavily on nostalgia and humor, while tying up most loose ends - as well as some that weren't even all that loose. Writers Derek Connolly, Colin Trevorrow (originally slated to direct), Chris Terrio, and Abrams seemed intent on giving each beloved character their moment, as a sign of appreciation for their contributions to a legacy that covers a period longer than the lifespan of some of the biggest Star Wars fans. As one who stood in line in 1977, it's an approach that I respect and have no problems with - knowing full well that some will.Any attempt to tie up previous threads must focus on the odd, mystical relationship between Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). Both are still conflicted and attempting to come to grips with who they are. Rey especially is struggling with her identity and roots. One of my favorite elements from The Last Jedi was inner-head conversations blended with cross-dimensional physical interactions between Kylo and Rey, and it's used beautifully here.So, the biggest complaint from me is that despite its nearly two-and-a-half hour run time, there is simply too much crammed in. Too much story and too many characters and too many things that get a glimpse or mention, but no real development. This movie is jam-packed, and 'convoluted' would not be too strong of a word to describe. There are times we aren't sure where the characters are or what they are doing or why they are doing it. We do know that everything good is dependent on 'this mission', a mission that seems to change direction about every 12 minutes. In fact, the 'new' players - Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) - spend very little time together on screen. And really, Finn is given almost nothing to do except look worried most of the time. On the bright side for characters, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C3PO both get their own sub-plots. Anthony Daniels (as C3PO) becomes the only actor to appear in all 9 episodes, although R2D2 joins C3PO as characters appearing in all.There are many old familiar faces, both good and evil. Some of these play key roles, while others are brief cameos. Much has been speculated about how Carrie Fisher's role as Leia will be handled. Archival footage, combined with special effects and camera angles, allows her to be present throughout, and yes, she gets the send-off she deserves. There are even some new characters/creatures introduced, including a cute new droid (never underestimate or under-market a droid) that is already for sale in Disney stores.No matter one's feelings or expectations, an area that surely will not disappoint is the visual effects. Somehow, this one is even more impressive and awe-inspiring than the others. In particular, a couple of scenes filmed in and around an angry sea left me dumbfounded, mouth-agape. However, what's most amazing is the consistency of the visuals throughout. It's just a stunning film to look at. Some of the story may be a bit confusing or cheesy, but some parts of the film are truly great. Cinematographer and Special Effects guru Dan Mindel deserves special mention, as do Production Designers Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins. Of course the visual effects team is without peer - and take up about 5 minutes in the closing credits.Lastly, composer John Williams gets to add his well-deserved personal stamp on this final chapter with new work added to the already iconic score. Very few moments compare to the opening notes blasting away on the theatre sound system as a Star Wars film begins. And as much as we'd like to treat this as the end, we all know Disney will find a way to keep us interested in a galaxy, far far away.",7,108,254,19 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Yes, That's Loud Enough
","Greetings again from the darkness. Plain and simple ... this is not my kind of movie. I fully understand there exists movie-goers who are thrilled that director Guillermo del Toro's latest finally hit theatres, but I really struggled with this mash-up of Transformers, Battleship and Godzilla, as well as what I believe to be a new world record for noise level. That being said, I do have some positive comments to make.The technological aspects of the movie are exceptional. It has a unique look with some of the best CGI ever seen. There is no shortage of action, which is typically good for an action movie ... but here, it seemed that one monster vs robot fight led right into the next one. The cast is very talented and represent some of the most entertaining shows on TV: Sons of Anarchy, True Blood, Homeland, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Justified. The downside is many of them don't seem overly excited to be here just to spout some of the worst dialogue of the year.The basic story is a war between mankind and the Kaiju - monsters from another world. World leaders work together to develop the Jaeger program ... robots co-piloted by two people who are drift compatible (a kind of mind meld that let's them fight as one). After years of struggling against the Kaiju, the world leaders decide instead to build a security wall around the main cities. Clearly they had not seen World War Z or read any of the 'fence' stories from the US/Mexico border. No surprise, but the robots have to be reactivated for the climactic battle scene.Iris Elba runs the Jaeger program and commands the pilots that include Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi, Max Martini, and Robert Kazinski. Hunnam is battling inner demons after the death of his brother (Diego Klattenhoff). For some reason, Hunnam plays his part with an overdose of bland. He seems to have been cast for his effectiveness in his shirtless scenes. Martini and Kazinski stand out here, probably because competition is so uninspired, oh and they have a dog. Ms. Kikuchi seems to be under the impression that her scenes were rehearsals as she can't quite hash out a consistent approach (translated: she is painful to watch). The usually great Elba alternates between a mumbled whisper and a full-out yell ... neither working too well. His 'canceling the apocalypse' speech seems to be right out of Independence Day.The comedy relief is provided by the shared scenes of Charlie Day and del Toro favorite Ron Perlman. Day is at his screechiest and Perlman at his most flamboyant, but it's not enough of the story to salvage much hope. Instead we get an endless number of hand-to-hand combat scenes between Jaeger and Kaiju. And they mostly all look the same: waist deep in water while its dark and rainy. Unless they happen to be completely underwater, where it's even darker.For all the negatives tossed out here, it must be ended with the reminder that the movie is a technical marvel to look at. I much prefer del Toro in the Pan's Labyrinth mode, and I would even prefer the old Japanese Godzilla monster-fests to this, but he has raised the bar for robotic and monster CGI. Maybe that's enough for your eyes and ears.",5,2,10,15 July 2013
American Sniper," A Compulsion to Serve
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown'. Shakespeare wrote those words for Henry IV, but director Clint Eastwood's latest film depicts the sentiment for Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL sharpshooter known as 'Legend'. Screenwriter Jason Hall adapted the story from Kyle's memoir (co-written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice).You may not be aware of the sniper's role during a war. In an early scene (used in the trailer) we experience the incredibly stressful moment of decision that Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) faces as a mother and young child enter the street  are they a threat to the platoon or not? The decision means killing a woman and child or risking the death of many U.S. soldiers. If he is wrong, he faces a jury and military shame. Most of us lack the capacity for such decision-making. As a flashback to Kyle's childhood shows, most of us are either sheep or wolves. Only a very few are sheepdogs with the aggressiveness to protect the flock. Chris Kyle: sheepdog.The story takes us through Chris' aimless young adult years on the cowboy circuit. He's a tough guy who likes to drink and party with his friends. September 11 acts as a call to action, a call to service. SEAL training is shown and the point is made that Chris is the old man in the group, but he displays a quiet leadership trait. We then witness his flirting with a snippy Taya (Sienna Miller) at a bar counter as his SEAL buddies throw darts at each other's bare backs (don't try that at home, kids). Soon enough Chris and Taya are married, and Chris is called to the front.Back and forth we go through Chris Kyle's four tours. His expertise in war is offset by his inability to adjust to family life. He has a compulsion to serve and to protect his fellow soldiers, but he is unable to fit into the suburban life of cell phones and grilled hamburgers. Not surprisingly, Taya struggles with his struggles. Bradley Cooper gets to be the legend, while Sienna Miller is the emotional mother who has seemingly lost her husband – not to death, but to an obsession to serve.The film does little to explain why Chris Kyle is exponentially more productive than other snipers, and even less to explore his PTSD and mental anguish outside of the front. It's Bradley Cooper's acting that provides us what insight we do get, and he does a remarkable job capturing the hulking, uncommunicative giant who doesn't really understand the 'legend' title  he's just doing his job and following his nature.The tragic end is handled with grace by Eastwood, and it left my full-capacity movie theatre as quiet as a church during prayer. It's possible to be a legend, but not a hero, and the movie makes no political statements regarding war or foreign policy. What it does show is that most of us are not sheepdogs.",7,17,41,16 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Clackers
","Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read Lauren Weisberger's best selling novel, I am not sure whom to credit with the terrific dialogue and sparkling one liners throughout the film. There are some doilies! As if there were any doubts, this movie belongs to Meryl Streep (how can there be any debate that she is the greatest working actress of our time?). If one was not familiar with her staggering resume, recognizing that this is the same woman singing into a microphone in the recently released 'A Prairie Home Companion' would be impossible. Ms. Streep is the master of her craft and is simply mesmerizing on screen. Studying the details of her performances should be where every actor wannabe starts their training. Streep complements her stream of non-stop dialogue with facial gestures and body language that convince you she is Miranda Priestly. By the way, her character is a cross between Cruella DeVille and Gordon Gekko - not the most likable or accessible personality one could design.The rest of the cast is fine, although doe-eyed Anne Hathaway gets pretty much chewed up and spit out in her scenes with Streep. Probably what the casting director had in mind. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt (as the real Emily, not the new Emily) really add some punch to their roles and Simon Baker (L.A. Confidential) and Adrian Grenier (Entourage) add eye candy for the ladies - as if the shoes, clothes and accessories aren't enough.What keeps the film from reaching the next level is simply the direction of David Frankel. His TV background is obvious as most every scene as the feel of a 'Sex and the City' episode and not a full blown Hollywood movie. The same material in a true movie director's hands would have been a step up.Can't help but mention, from a guy's perspective, that there is more lipstick in this movie than in the movie 'Lipstick'. Make-up, hair, jewelry and clothes are overdone to the point of being laughable. Again, it's all part of the show, but it does help to point out what a joke the fashion industry plays on women every year.",7,1,1,2 July 2006
Corpse Bride," Dearly Beloved and Deceased
","Greetings again from the darkness. Tim Burton reminds me of a 'Seinfeld' episode when Kramer tells Jerry he is going to a fantasy camp and Jerry says 'Kramer's whole life is a fantasy camp'. Burton has earned his place in Hollywood and is now in a position to create what he wants, when he wants it. Best known for his films such as 'Batman', 'Beetlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Big Fish' and this year's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', Burton never fails to deliver a creative piece of film-making that brings something new to the screen.'Corpse Bride' is no exception with its stunning artistry and animation accompanied by a solid story line, terrific music and star power voice acting from the likes of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson and Albert Finney. Check out some of the details of the animation - wood rot on the Bride's casket and intricacy in the costumes. The great Danny Elfman shines once again with amazing music and work as Bonejangles. The entire saloon musical fantasy is unlike anything ever seen on film.All the voice acting is excellent, but special notice goes to Helena Bonham Carter as the Corpse Bride, Jane Horracks as the Black Widow and the legend, Christopher Lee as the Pastor. Probably not for very small kids, but otherwise most kids, teens and adults should enjoy and appreciate this excellent, though short film. One cool bit of nostalgia is that the brand of piano in the mansion is Harryhausen, a Burton tip of the cap to the original master of stop action special effects seen in the old dinosaur and Sinbad movies.",8,1,3,9 October 2005
Lion," finding roots on google earth
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes the real life story is enough. The story of Saroo Brierley is proof. A 5 year old boy from rural India gets stranded at a train station and inadvertently takes a train trip that strands him in Calcutta, thousands of miles from home. He is adopted by a Tasmanian couple and later uses Google Earth to systematically track down his village, family, and ultimately his self.Saroo's story would be interesting enough had a writer fabricated it; but in fact, Luke Davis adapted the screenplay directly from Mr. Brierley's book 'A Long Way Home'. Director Garth Davis and an exceptional cast bring this incredible and inspirational and touching story to the big screen in a wonderfully entertaining manner.The first part of the film introduces us to 5 year old Saroo (a bright-eyed and energetic Sunny Pawar) and his beloved and protective older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate). The two boys are nearly inseparable and seem oblivious to the hard life provided by the small village they live in - where their mother literally carries rocks all day. A fluke of circumstance causes the train station separation for the brothers, and young Saroo finds himself on a train ride that will forever change his life.Very little dialogue is found in this first part, but we immediately connect with the young boy, and we feel his frantic desire to return home as a tightness in our chest as he falls into the quagmire of homeless kids in Calcutta. When Saroo first meets Sue and John Brierley (Nicole Kidman, David Wenham), he isn't sure how to react. His assimilation into this unrecognizable new world might just as well have been on another planet as a home in Tasmania.Once the film jumps ahead, Dev Patel takes over as Saroo and the film turns into a journey for the universal need to understand our identity  where we come from, and who we really are. Rooney Mara has a small but important role as Saroo's girlfriend Lucy (a composite character), as does Divian Ladwa as Mantosh, another boy adopted by the Brierleys. It's here where Google Earth enjoys its biggest plug as the tool Saroo utilizes to solve the mystery of his origin. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Greig Fraser, and he perfectly captures the harshness of young Saroo's home village, the frenzied pace of Calcutta and the beauty of Tasmania  all without losing the emotions of any given moment. To cap it off and to prove the filmmakers never stooped to any 'trickery', the film ends with actual footage of Saroo reuniting with his mother, and then the magical moment when his two mothers embrace. Good luck maintaining composure during this part!",7,3,7,12 January 2017
The Passion of Joan of Arc," silent masterpiece
","Oak Cliff Film Festival 2018
Greetings again from the darkness. It's a rare treat to watch a 90 year old silent movie. Especially in a remastered format. Especially on the big screen. Especially at a historic theatre. Especially with a nearly packed house. And especially with a live score! The 7th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival, held at the Texas Theatre (opened 1931), afforded just such a treat with its Friday evening screening.Most know the story of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), a teenage heroine of France for her role in the Hundred Year War. She claimed that she received spiritual and religious guidance through voices and visions. Once she was captured by English allies, she was charged with heresy and burned at the stake in Rouen in 1431. A quarter century later, the Pope declared her a martyr and she became a symbol of France - canonized as a saint in 1920. Of course, here the story is as much about the film as it is the martyr and historical figure.The eyes are what first grab our attention. The eyes of actress Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. It was Falconetti's only screen appearance, and though she spent the rest of her career on stage, this role cemented her place in cinematic history. Without the benefit of sound and voice, the silent era performer had to emote through eyes, facial expression and body movement. Few ever did it better than Falconetti. It's gut-wrenching to watch the church counsel attempt to break her resolve. Our minds hear the intensity of their voices though we only read the subtitles. Renowned Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer directs the script from writer Joseph Delteil (taken mostly from the transcripts of the trial), and the cinematography is through the eye of 5 time Oscar nominee Rudolph Mate' (FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES). It's impossible not to notice a style so different from modern day filmmaking. The harsh lighting and almost exclusive use of close-ups and medium shots bring an immediacy of which we aren't accustomed. The single piece set is quite unusual and provides a stage aura. Another thing that stands out is the editing style. Continuity of scene wasn't important here. What mattered was the sense of frantic pacing and over-bearing stress brought on by the rapid-fire questioning. We share the claustrophobic feeling with Joan, though of course, we know where this is all headed.As part of this special showing, the Oak Cliff Film Festival arranged for a live score performed by composer George Sarah, a 4 piece chamber orchestra, and a vocal group accompanying the music. Perhaps this meant even more to me since I visited Rouen last year, and the lasting legacy (almost 600 years) of this courageous young woman is evident throughout much of France. The re-mastered film is stunning to look at, and even more historically important knowing that the film had long thought to be lost to a fire. The story and the film are quite something to experience.",8,2,3,20 June 2018
Gone Baby Gone," Small enough not to matter
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ben Affleck loves cameras. Doesn't seem to matter to him if he is front or behind. As a director, he still tries to be the star. The heavy handed camera work throughout the film really detracts from a decent story that could have benefited from a more seasoned filmmaker. Enough already with the swooping shots from the helicopter, and the grainy night shots showing the tough street types. Nice work from a film a student.On the other hand, brother Casey does a very admirable job as the lead in this multi-layered story that really doesn't hold surprises, but is fun to watch unfold. Casey's deadpan delivery, stoic stares, monotone mutterings and baby face features combine to give a unique look to our hero. This plays well against the liveliness of the stunningly talented Michelle Monaghan and the heavy screen presence of Morgan Freeman and the manic frenzy of Ed Harris. Young Casey is the calm in the eye of the storm.Other nice supporting turns are from Amy Ryan, who shows us how not to win mommy of the year; Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver. Additionally, director Ben flashes some of the ugliest humans this side of the Springer show or a Michael Moore documentary. Some would be right at home in the State Fair freak show. That part was more gruesome than the actual violence.Most certainly this is not at the level of 'Mystic River', 'Good Will Hunting' or any Scorcese film, but the screenplay is interesting and worthy of film ... and lacking only a pro's touch behind the camera.",6,2,6,3 December 2007
The Lost City of Z," 3 trips
","Greetings again from the darkness. We aren't likely to watch a more beautiful or expertly photographed film this year. Director James Gray's project looks and feels like a throwback to days of epic filmmaking, and cinematographer Darius Khandji (Se7en, Evita, The Immigrant) fills the screen with green and gold hues (similar to Out of Africa) that deliver both a sense of realism and a touch of romanticism. The minor quibble here is with the emphasis on the biographical rather than the more interesting and compelling and adventuresome expeditions to the 'new' world.Our true to life hero (and the film's portrayal provides no other description) is military man and explorer Percy Fawcett played by Charlie Hunnam. Based on the book by David Grann, the film divides focus into three areas: the stuffy, poorly lit backrooms of London power moguls; the 1916 WWI front line where Fawcett proves his mettle; the jungles of Amazonia wherein lies Fawcett's hope for glory and redemption. It's the latter of these that are by far the most engaging, and also the segments that leave us pining for more detail.The three Fawcett expeditions form the structure for the quite long run time (2 hours, 21 minutes). In 1906 the Royal Geographic Society enlisted Fawcett for a 'mapping' journey to distinguish boundaries around Bolivia in what had become a commercially important area due to the black gold known as rubber. Fawcett was not just a manly-man, he was also obsessed with overcoming his 'poor choice in ancestors' and gaining a position of status within society. Using his military training and personal mission, that first expedition (with help from a powerful character played by the great Franco Nero) was enough to light Fawcett's lifelong fixation on proving the existence of Z (Zed) and the earlier advanced society.Back home, Fawcett's wife Nina (Sienna Miller) shows flashes of turn-of-the-century feminism, though lacking in judgment when she suggests a ridealong with her husband on his next expedition. Although the couple spends little time together, given the years-long trips, they do manage to produce a hefty brood of kids, the eldest played by Tom Holland (the new Spider-Man).1912 brings the second Amazonia expedition, the one in which renowned Antarctic explorer James Murray (a snarly Angus Macfayden) joins Fawcett and his by now loyal and expert travel companion Henry Costin (a terrific Robert Pattison). The trip proceeds as one might expect when an ego-driven, unqualified yet wealthy passenger is along for only the glory. Murray's history is well documented and here receives the treatment he earned.It's the third trip in 1925 that Fawcett makes with his son that will be his last, and the one that dealt the unanswered questions inspiring Mr. Grann to research and write his book. It's also the segment of the film that leaves us wanting more details  more time in the jungle. With the overabundance of information and data available to us these days, the staggering courage and spirit of those willing to jump in a wooden canoe on unchartered waters and trek through lands with no known back story, offer more than enough foundation for compelling filmmaking. It's this possibility of historical discovery that is the real story, not one man's lust for medals and confirmation. More jungle could have elevated this from very good to monumental filmmaking.",8,7,14,20 April 2017
Southpaw," Tap Tap
","Greetings again from the darkness. Is it possible to have a boxing movie without a crusty old trainer? Or a cute kid? Or a stubborn macho lead who makes poor personal choices? It doesn't seem to matter much as this latest from director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) checks off most of the expected cliché's, and still slides easily into the canon of boxing movies that now covers nine decades.This one packs a satisfactory punch both inside the ring and out. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Billy Hope (the name courtesy of first time screenwriter Kurt Sutter, known for 'Sons of Anarchy'). Mr. Hope follows the expected arc: 1. On top of the World! 2. A nasty crash landing 3. Redemption and comeback. However, just because we are familiar with the trail, doesn't mean we can't enjoy the hike.Gyllenhaal continues his impressive string of performances that include End of Watch, Prisoners, and Nightcrawler. In the latter, he transformed his body by losing 40 pounds. This time, he packs on the muscle to become convincing as a boxer. The recent trend of actors getting fat, skinny, ripped or ugly to attract awards attention is nothing new to Gyllenhaal, who has made a career of melding into his roles.The supporting cast includes Rachel McAdams as Hope's wife. The two share a background as orphans in Hell's Kitchen and have a strong relationship with each other and their young daughter played by Oona Laurence. Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson plays Hope's long-time manager who telegraphs his true colors much too early (and no, this doesn't refer to the recent news involving Mr. Jackson). Naomie Harris is a bit underutilized as the social worker, but the film is at its best once Forest Whitaker enters as Hope's last hope (sorry). Mr. Whitaker always elevates a film with his presence, and his character here would have provided a boost with even more screen time.A few topics are touched upon, though none very deeply. The father-daughter story line was pretty effective, but the anger management issue could have been explored more effectively since it was so crucial to the story and Hope's personality.Eminem provides some new music for the film, and it should be noted that this was the final score composed by the great James Horner, who only recently passed away. Sure the film 'borrows' from Rocky and Raging Bull and many other boxing classics, but at least it doesn't go full 'Champ' on us.",6,0,1,26 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Follow the Pinata
","Greetings again from the darkness. The original 1987-91 TV series 'jump' started Johnny Depp's mega-superstardom career, and yes, he is a generous enough to appear in a brief cameo in this updated film from co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. The script from co-writers Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill makes little effort to stay true to the source material and that works in the film's favor.We first meet Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as polar opposites at the same high school. One of them is a pudgy, nerdy looking guy trying hard to throw down an Eminem look, while the other is the ultra-cool jock who is skating by academically. Guess which is which? Flash forward seven years and these two are still misfits ... this time at the police academy where one aces the physical fitness tests and bombs academically and the other is just the opposite. Guess which is which? So these two decide to become buddies and help each other live the dream as badass cops.Cut to the next scene where they are patrolling a park on bicycles visualizing their first big bust. When things go wrong ... SURPRISE! ... they are assigned to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), an angry man who runs the Jump Street undercover unit out of a Korean church. Since neither Hill nor Tatum look anything like high schoolers, the absurdity is written into the script. They become the most mis-matched brothers since Schwarzenegger and Devito in Twins.Their mission is to discover the dealers and source for a new drug making its way through a local high school. The drug has already killed one student and it takes these two 'brothers' about 5 minutes to uncover the dealers. The supplier is a bit slower to come and the process involves numerous comedy skits involving Tatum as a science geek and Hill as Peter Pan.The comedy skits involve nice work from Elle Kemper, Nick Offerman, Rob Riggle and Chris Parnell. The cool kids are played by Dave Franco (James' brother) and Brie Larson. Car chases, a keg party, science experiments and the prom all play a role, as do white tuxedos and one of the oddest shootouts ever filmed. What seems like 1200 rounds are fired in a hotel room before someone is actually hit.In addition to Depp's pretty cool cameo, there's also an appearance from Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson Peete, both from the TV series. Of course the story is ridiculous and the film never really takes itself seriously, but I was actually somewhat impressed with Channing Tatum's ability to play deadpan to Jonah Hill's slapstick. The two worked pretty well together and there are enough laughs to make this one worth seeing.",6,3,7,18 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Star Spangled Man with a Plan
","Greetings again from the darkness. If it seems to you as if the past three years have provided an overload of superhero and comic-based movies, you are absolutely correct. There have been too many. There are a few I would be willing to toss out, but Captain America is not one of them. This ranks right with the first Iron Man as the closest to a real movie ... one with a story to go with the action and CGI.This one begins with the present day discovery of an exposed plane wing jutting from the frozen Arctic tundra. The search team quickly finds the Captain America shield visible beneath the ice. Flash back to WWII and we are introduced to a scrawny Steve Rogers who wants nothing more than to fight for his country. Unfortunately, this 90-pound weakling might as well have 4-F stamped on his forehead.His tenacity at trying to enlist is noticed by a powerful scientist named Erskine (played with sheer smirking joy by Stanley Tucci). Erskine happens to be working with Col. Phillips (a grumpy Tommy Lee Jones) on a secret plan to develop super-soldiers with the injectable cocktail Erskine has invented. As you might guess, the plan is thwarted immediately after scrawny Steve Rogers is transformed into a super soldier yanked from the pages of Men's Fitness.Working with Col Phillips and Erskine is Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). Her main purpose seems to be testing the brightest red lipstick and flashing her legs in front of the soldiers. She falls for Rogers and spends most of her scenes staring somewhat scarily into his eyes. Actually, their scenes together are pretty good and her character helps us remember that Captain America is still just a regular guy ... not a Norse God.Personally, I thought the movie lagged just a bit in the fight scenes between good and evil. But that doesn't mean I didn't find Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) to be a terrific bad guy. Nazi's still make for the perfect adversary. Although, I found myself laughing on occasion as Weaving's German accent reminded me of Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds.What makes this movie work is the fact that Captain America remains Steve Rogers. He is always a good guy wanting to do the right things. He is deeply affected when he thinks his actions may have caused the death of his best friend Bucky. But he also manages to keep his ego in check and his patriotic duty in the forefront. Also, the film is directed by Joe Johnston. If you are unfamiliar with his work, let me recommend two of his underrated earlier films: The Rocketeer and Hidalgo. You are probably familiar with his Jumanji and October Sky. He is a director that creates a specific look and feel to his films, and the texture helps make this one work.Since this is entitled Captain America: The First Avenger, it is obviously another step towards The Avengers movie slated for 2012. So don't miss Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark/Iron Man). And don't miss Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the odd ending to this film ... and the obligatory 'extra' after closing credits.",7,2,16,23 July 2011
American Hustle," Dirty Work
","Greetings again from the darkness. Over the years, there have been some very entertaining con artist films, and they range from outright comedy (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) to cheeky (The Sting) to dramatic (The Grifters). My personal favorite is David Mamet's House of Games, a very quiet and subtle look at the con. The stylistic opposite of Mamet's gem is the latest from director David O Russell. It's like comparing Duke Ellington to Donna Summer - both of which are featured on this soundtrack.For the past few months, I have said that this film's trailer is one of the best I have ever seen. The energy and visuals were enthralling and have had me anxiously awaiting a chance to see the film. So please understand when I say that the movie does not quite match the expectations, it's not really a criticism ... more of a tip of the cap to the marketing efforts. This is one showy, flamboyant, often frenetic wild ride that is also a bit messy and sometimes even clunky.Hair, clothes, cars, music ... the best and worst of the 1970's ... are on full display. Christian Bale sets a new standard for worst (and most elaborate and labor-intensive) comb-over in film history. Bradley Cooper's perm wins the contest for tightest curls over Emma Thompson in Saving Mr Banks. Jeremy Renner's pompadour would make any rockabilly performer envious. And let's not forget the women. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence provide a steady stream of flowing and floppy locks that would keep any shampoo or blow dryer company in business. The soundtrack, usually coordinated to story events, also includes Steely Dan, Jeff Lynne, Elton John and many others.Director Russell's most recent films include The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. He is obviously infatuated with odd characters who are slightly off from society. What better topic than con artists so desperate to be liked that they spend all effort trying to rip off the gullible types? Now mix that trait with the ambitious persona of Bradley Cooper's FBI Agent and the US Attorney played by Alessandro Nivola, and you have a collision of worlds that results in a fictionalized account of the ABSCAM events of the late 70's and early 80's. I say fictionalized because the film starts with a banner that states 'Some of this actually happened'. What did or what didn't really doesn't matter here.Who is playing whom? What is real and what is part of the con? Those are the questions that we as viewers ask, and oddly enough, these are the same questions the key characters ask. If they can't tell, we certainly have no chance.This one is all about the characters. Mr. Bale (40 lbs heavier) bears no resemblance to Batman. He embodies the falsely confident con man. Cooper is a bit over-hyped in his role, while Adams is at her best in a role that is the film's most diverse. The real explosion comes every time Jennifer Lawrence is on screen. Not only do things blow up in her kitchen, but she jolts the film in each of her scenes. Some may be tired of Ms. Lawrence's recent success, but as a film lover, I put her screen presence very near that of Marilyn Monroe. She grabs our attention and holds it. That's talent that very few possess.Supporting work that should be noted includes Louis CK as Cooper's reluctant supervisor, Michael Pena as a fake sheik (can they do that?), Jack Huston and Shea Whigaham (both from Boardwalk Empire), and the great and rarely seen Anthony Zerbe (one of the all time TV villains). There is also a high profile cameo that seems right in line with Russell's adoration of Scorcese's Goodfellas.If you are looking for a film to analyze and dissect, you will be most disappointed in this one. If you are looking for a fun, wildly visual and very entertaining retro film, this one should fit the bill. Just keep your hand on your wallet and don't be one of the suckers.",8,2,10,21 December 2013
The Godfather: Part II," This is the business we have chosen
","Six weeks ago was The Godfather in a theatre setting. This time it was the sequel, which generated an equal amount of movie bliss. Experiencing these two classic movies on the big screen almost 40 years after release reinforces what great films they are  and how few truly great films get made. We are reminded that a powerful well-written story, world class cast, visionary director, brilliant photographer and stunning composer are all necessary components for movie greatness.This sequel explores three time periods: the journey of 9 year old Vito to the U.S., his rise to power in Little Italy, and Corleone life after Vito's death. Some find the cuts to varying timelines to be distracting. Personally, I find it fascinating and a very effective way to tell the entire story. Watching an almost mute 9 year old Vito land on Ellis Island and transform into a twenty-something community 'leader' is one of the more powerful and unlikely events ever seen on screen. Mix that with Al Pacino holding little back as a power-mongering Michael is downright frightening. If you doubt this, look at it from the perspective of Diane Keaton's May, or John Cazale's Fredo.The film received 11 Oscar nominations and won 6, including Best Picture. Robert DeNiro won for his tremendous turn as young Vito. This is early DeNiro  the Mean Streets, Taxi Driver era. DeNiro and Marlon Brando remain the only two actors to have won Oscars for playing the same character. Two other acting nominations went to Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V Gazzo as Pentangeli. Mr. Strasberg was the famed acting teacher whose prized pupils included none other than Al Pacino (who talked him into taking this role). Strasberg was also bequeathed 75% of the Marilyn Monroe estate and there was much scandal after his death when his widow auctioned off most of it.A couple of other interesting points were that most of this script was original for the film, though the background story of Vito was drawn from Mario Puzo's novel. Director Francis Ford Coppola considered casting Joe Pesci as the young Clemenza, but ultimately decided on Bruno Kirby. Dominic Chianese plays Hyman Roth's right hand man Johnny Ola. Chianese has been recently seen in both The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. B-Movie mogul Roger Corman plays one of the Senators on the committee interrogating Michael and Pentangeli. Harry Dean Stanton plays one of the FBI bodyguards, and former heartthrob Troy Donahue plays Connie's (Talia Shire) goofy boyfriend Merle. One of my favorite characters in the film is Don Fanucci, robustly played by Gastone Moschin. His strutting and preening always creeps me out and makes me laugh.Besides being the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar, The Godfather II is simply one of the finest films ever made. At 200 minutes, it requires both a time and mental commitment, but along with The Godfather, Coppola and Puzo have provided us exemplary story telling through expert filmmaking.",10,1,3,20 April 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Sir, He drove off the roof
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is absolutely one of the best and exciting action films ever. Nothing really new from the story side, but director Paul Greengrass (back at the helm after 'Bourne Supremacy') is a master of chase scenes and tight space action. And as I have said before, Matt Damon is Jason Bourne ... it is that rare perfect blend of character and actor.New faces include some terrific acting from David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine and the always great Albert Finney. The regular ladies are back as Julia Stiles and Joan Allen remain the weak links in the series.What makes the Ludlum franchise so wonderful is that you can't always immediately tell the good guys from the bad guys. The perfect example is Jason Bourne. After the first two films, we know the guys has some darkness in his past, but we are pulling for him all the time. Should we be? This third installment provides some answers, but make no mistake, what sets this one apart is the action. Director and star are in prime form and it is quite a rush!",8,0,2,4 August 2007
Rush," The Closer You are to Death
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan are back in their wheelhouse with a film based on real people. Their previous collaboration was Frost/Nixon, and they also had separate 'true stories': Howard with Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, and Morgan with The Queen and Last King of Scotland. Here they tackle personality opposites and fierce Formula One competitors James Hunt and Niki Lauda.The two lead actors are perfectly cast. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) slips seamlessly into the swashbuckling, rebellious playboy that was Great Britain's James Hunt. Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds, Goodbye Lenin!) becomes the focused, determined, meticulous Spanish-German Niki Lauda. You might think of Hunt as an X-Games type who thrives on publicity and fun, while Lauda is more scientist or engineer driven by the quest for perfection. Both were World Champions and their rivalry brought out the best in each.Do not think for a second that you need be a Formula One expert or even know the backstory of Hunt and Lauda to enjoy this movie. It is extremely entertaining and exciting. Morgan's script might hover a bit more on the oh-so-photogenic Hunt/Hemsworth character, but it also does a nice job of preventing the not-so-likable Lauda from being a bad guy. In fact, it demonstrates that champions are not all alike.The look of the film is exemplary. Beautifully photographed by DP Anthony Dod Mantle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire), the colors and grainy texture make this look like it was filmed in the 1970's, not just based then. While the racing scenes are stunning, it is actually an intimate look at this world and the men of this era. Without dwelling on it, we get a realistic feel for the fiery crash that caused Lauda's horrific injuries and his extraordinary fight to recovery while in the hospital.We also get a peek at the very different marriages of these two men. Hunt's short lived bond with model Suzy Miller (played by Olivia Wilde)ended when her affair with Richard Burton caused the final split between Burton and Liz Taylor. Lauda's relationship with his wife (Alexandria Maria Lara) occurred without the whirlwind, but in a very real and organic manner. Both are an additional touch of realism to a quite real story.There have been no shortage of racing movies over the years. Some good: Le Mans (Steve McQueen) and Grand Prix (James Garner). Some not so good: Days of Thunder (Tom Cruise) and Driven (Sylvester Stallone). Ron Howard's latest clearly finishes near the top at the finish line.",8,4,6,28 September 2013
Nightcrawler," A Real Opportunity
","Greetings again from the darkness. Many of us still catch ourselves asking 'Why is this news?' while watching the local newscasts. We ask this despite knowing sensationalist journalism is the way of the world, and writer/director Dan Gilroy reminds us ... if it bleeds, it leads.Jake Gyllenhaal continues his progression as one of the most fascinating actors working today. Here he plays Lou Bloom, a fast-talking, self-help studying, ultra-charming sociopath, with creepy bug eyes (thanks to a 20-25 lb weight loss) and an even creepier grin. Mr Gyllenhaal nails the role in a way that reminds of Travis Bickle of Taxi Driver (Robert DeNiro was 33 at the time - the same age as Jake now).Three other movies came to mind while watching this: Network (the lack of a conscience approach to ratings), Drive (the stylistic camera work and loner lead character), and Body Double (a fascinating Brian DePalma film from years ago). Rene Russo is the veteran news woman who encourages and enables the Bloom character to use his 'good eye' to pursue the money shots ... defined as anything that strikes fear into the suburban world.Gyllenhaal is all in for his role as Bloom. Nightcrawling is the label given to stringers (private cameramen) who compete for the video that will lead the newscasts. Bloom's google-based training has turned him into a Tony Robbins type who blows through dialogue at a speed every bit as fast as he drives his red Dodge Challenger to the next tragedy. Bloom is the epitome of charm in the wrong hands. Think Ted Bundy with a camera. While Bundy actually committed the murders, Bloom blurs the line between recorder of history and influencing the criminal action. He also delivers one of the first on screen 'chasing a car chase' scenes.This is Dan Gilroy's directorial debut, though he has written over films, including The Bourne Legacy, which was directed by his brother Tony. Dan also wrote my of my favorite rarely seen films entitled The Fall (2006). Dan Gilroy is married to Rene Russo, and her calm, yet equally sleazy, presence works well with the quirky, in-your-face Gyllenhaal character. Cinematographer Robert Elswit (known for his work with Paul Thomas Anderson) beautifully captures the nighttime energy of Los Angeles, as well as the brutal and savage crime scenes.Gyllenhaal is the real deal here, and somehow makes this frightening monster believable as a guy who could walk amongst us every day (or night). Early on in the film, his character is asking for a job and spouts off a line that includes a bit about being 'raised in the self-esteem movement so popular in schools'.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Having read quite a bit about Howard Hughes and having some of my most memorable movie experiences be from the eye of Martin Scorcese, I was most anxious for the release of the film. This may however be one of the few times when Mr. Scorcese actually underplays the importance and legend of a character. The movie is wonderful (typcially breath-taking Scorcese visuals), but falls short of being great, in part because Leonardo DiCaprio is not able to capture the presence of Hughes the man. The look and mannerisms are fine, but we never experience that feeling of greatness that so many talk about when discussing what it was like to be around the man. Some artistic license was taken with Hughes' withdrawal after the near fatal plane crash. Scorcese draws on what he became later to show that the head injury was the beginning of the fall for this very brilliant, tormented man. As usual, Scorcese provides a stellar supporting cast including Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Riley, Jude Law and Gwen Stefani. Baldwin's 'meeting' with Hughes held with a door between them is a riveting Baldwin performance similar to 'Glengarry Glen Ross'. John C. Riley perfectly captures the puppy dog loyalty of Noah Dietrich, but the performance that jumps off the screen is Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. I truly believe these two were soul mates who understood each other, but were misunderstood by most everyone else. Hepburn's independent boldness was way ahead of her time. Overall, the movie captures Hughes at the most creative point in his life and does an admirable job, just not great.",8,1,3,1 January 2005
Oblivion," Another Day in Paradise
","Greetings again from the darkness. Here we have Exhibit Number One in proving the theory that no quantity or quality of movie special effects can overcome the lack a good story. Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) directs his own graphic novel, and the result is a beautiful and impressive looking film that lacks any substance and fails to develop any characters for us to care about.This almost plays as a sci-fi tribute with tips of the cap to at least the following: The Matrix, Moon, Total Recall, Inception, Planet of the Apes, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 2001: A Space Odyssey ... and even Top Gun! Unfortunately, it falls short of all of those except for the stunning visual effects of the patrol drones (George Lucas would be proud) and the beautiful photography of Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi).The most obvious comparison is with Wall-E. This time, Tom Cruise plays the 'mop-up crew' along with his assigned spouse played by Andrea Riseborough (very good as Wallis Simpson in W.E., and recently seen in Disconnect). We learn from the initial voice-over (by Cruise, not Morgan Freeman) that Earth was left in ruins after a long battle with aliens. Now the last bit of Earth's resources are being harvested before it is deserted forever.The cast is pretty deep with an extremely upbeat Melissa Leo showing up in the 'Hal' role on a low-res video screen, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as leaders of the underground surviving humans, Olga Kurylenko (a Bond girl in Quantum of Solace, and currently in To The Wonder), and even stunt-woman extraordinare Zoe Bell making an appearance.All the wonderful toys are present, the look and feel are really something to see, the Jetsons-style home is kinda cool, and we get the ever-present Cruise sprint ... this time in a space suit! Despite all the goodies, this one just seems to fall flat in the ability to draw us in. If you are a sci-fi visual type, you'll get a kick out of it. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an effective team.",6,0,1,27 April 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," That VOICE!
","Greetings again from the darkness. That VOICE! During my life, I've been fortunate enough to see many of rock's greatest bands live in concert, including: The Who, The Rolling Stones, Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC. Each of these bands are amazing, but no other concert combined the energy, showmanship and musicianship as Queen (two different tours). And certainly no other lead singer donned a Harlequin leotard ... only Freddie Mercury could make that look seem natural.This is such an odd movie, and one that is somewhat difficult to discuss. It's billed as an 'inspiring story', though one wonders how self-destructive living, an acrimonious band break-up, and dying young of AIDS could be considered inspiring. It's not supposed to be a biopic, but the vast majority of the screen time is devoted to Freddie Mercury. And to really confound us, the film kind of drags (pun possibly intended) during the personal story times ... and then explodes with greatness during the band and live performance segments.Rami Malek plays Freddie Mercury, and he perfectly captures the swagger and strut of one of rock's greatest theatrical showmen. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsari in Zanzibar, and the film shows us his conservative family and time spent working as a baggage handler at Heathrow. Of course, things change quickly once he joins up with guitarist Brian May (played here by Gwylim Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy, MARY SHELLEY). When bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) is added, Queen is born.With a story and script from two Oscar nominated writers, Peter Morgan (THE QUEEN, ironically) and Anthony McCarten (THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), it's surprising that much of the film is downright slow - especially the bits with frenemy Paul (Allen Leach). Perhaps this is more a factor of the issues with the director's chair, where Bryan Singer is credited despite being fired during production. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel filled in until Dexter Fletcher (next year's Elton John biopic ROCKETMAN) was hired to complete the film. Lucy Boynton (so good in SING STREET) holds her own as Mercury's wife and friend Mary Austin, and Mike Myers plays producer Ray Foster (with a tip of the cap to WAYNE'S WORLD). Other supporting work comes courtesy of Dickie Beau as influential DJ Kenny Everett, Aiden Gillen, Tom Hollander and Aaron McCusker.The 20th Century Fox opening fanfare has its own Queen version, and is not to be missed as the film begins. Of course, it's the infamous 1985 Live Aid performance that is the film's highlight and one that will leave every audience member pumped up, smiling, and singing along. It's a stunning sequence on a custom built Wembley Stadium stage, and it helps erase much of the tedium of the film's non-band scenes. Erasing any doubt as to whether the film is worth the price of addition ... hearing that VOICE at full volume on today's theatrical sound systems. Killer Queen.",6,12,24,26 October 2018
Burn After Reading," ebullient
","Greetings again from the darkness. As usual, high expectations often lead to disappointment when it comes to movies. Being a huge Coen Brothers fan, I can happily re-watch just about any of their films at just about any moment (exceptions would by The LadyKillers and Intolerable Cruelty). Despite a tremendous cast, 'Burn After Reading' just seems to go nowhere, I didn't have much fun getting there! The two best characters in this one are Brad Pitt as a perky, dim-witted personal trainer (replete with Vanilla Ice/Eraserhead hair) and John Malkovich as former CIA agent Osbourne Cox. In A-typical Coen Brothers fashion, most of the other characters pretty much fall flat ... in an over-the-top kind of way.The amazing cast is completed by Tilda Swinton playing Malkovich's bitchy wife who is sleeping with/dominating George Clooney's character, who is a paranoid sleazeball and seems to have no real purpose other than to also be sleeping with Frances McDormand, who is partnering with goof-ball Brad Pitt to blackmail Malkovich out of $50,000. Richard Jenkins is the fitness center manager who has a quiet crush on McDormand and is fed up with Pitt.There are some funny moments and certainly a couple of pure Coen Brothers scenes, but the story and the characters just don't seem complete, which is the biggest surprise and disappointment. I can only assume that Ethan and Joel felt the same way, and that the J.K. Simmons character speaks for them when he speaks lines such as 'Well we really don't have much, do we?'.",6,5,12,13 September 2008
Watchmen," You're in here with ME!
","Greetings again from the darkness. While not a rabid, obsessed fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel, I certainly enjoyed the read and was anxious for the film (for about 15 years now!) Director Zach Snyder ('300') stays very close to script with a product that should please all but the most persnickety fans.The film is a hard 'R' rating and I just couldn't believe how many under 10 year olds were in the theatre. Why so many idiot parents? The violence and gore is brutal and graphic. The film unquestionably sets the cinematic record for most screen time for a blue penis. This is not Bugs Bunny folks, this is an adult presentation of a graphic novel ... and a very good and unique one, at that.Overall I was pretty pleased with the casting. Billy Crudup (Almost Famous) as Dr Manhattan (voice and head) was plenty mystical, Malin Akerman (27 Dresses) surprises as Silk Spectre II, while Carla Gugino was a bit over the top as her mom. Jeffrey Dean Morgan's too brief Comedian turn was excellent and Patrick Wilson was fine as the soulful Nite Owl and slightly wimpy Dan Dreiberg ... complete with the Clark Griswald eyeglasses. While the weak link was unfortunately Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, the unquestionable strength of the cast was Jackie Earle Haley as the hardened Rorschach. His scenes are fascinating ... as is that terrific ink blot mask! Snyder does a good job with the soundtrack, though it easily qualifies as the oddest placement for the great Leonard Cohen's song 'Hallelujah'. Stay for the credits to catch Leonard's 'First we take Manhattan'. The absolute best sequence of the film is the historical montage featuring highlights of the heroes' early years played over Dylan's 'The Times They are a'Changin''. Sure the ending was changed out of necessity and it is a bit long in running time, but Snyder has done a wonderful job with the outstanding source material and this one can be watched and enjoyed a few times.",7,1,5,7 March 2009
The Italian Job," Forget the Coopers, I want a Charlize
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Today's giant movie screens and earth rumbling sound systems make action films an exhilarating experience.  Throw in a nice story and some eye candy and it is truly a blast.  OK the story is just a reshaping of the original with Michael Caine, but the added humor - mostly supplied by Seth Green ('Austin Powers' and 'Knockaround Guys') and the super cool guys - Jason Statham, Marky Mark and veteran Donald Sutherland add a punch to this one.  Who am I kidding?  The big difference here is the eye candy!  The mini-Coopers and Charlize Theron add a touch of Bond.  Whether the stunner is driving the fun cars or cracking a safe in her hotel room, she is captivating.  The films weak link is the usually dependable Edward Norton who seems to be sleep walking through his role. Maybe he has reached the point where he feels he deserves more screen time. His role is important, but his lackluster performance doesn't ruin the film at all.  Would have enjoyed seeing what a meatier performance could have added to the film, though.  Anyway, enjoy the ride and the view!",7,1,2,5 June 2003
Baby Driver," You make wrong things right
","Greetings again from the darkness. If his movies are any indication, writer/director Edgar Wright would be fun to hang out with. He thrives on action and humor, and seems committed to making movies that are entertaining, rather than philosophical life statements. Many know his work from Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End), while others are fans of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. High concept, high energy and a creative use of music are identifiable traits within Mr. Wright's films, all of which are crucial to the success of his latest.Ansel Elgort (excellent in The Fault in Our Stars) stars as Baby, a freakishly talented getaway driver paying off a debt to a no-nonsense crime boss Doc played by Kevin Spacey. Baby has an unusual movie affliction – a childhood accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus. He compensates for the constant ringing in his ear by listening to music through ear buds attached to one of his many iPods (depending on his mood). In fact, his insistence on finding just the right song for the moment adds a colorful element to each escape route.The film opens with what may be its best car chase scene and the hyper-kinetic approach sets the stage for something a bit different than what we usually see. There are no car drops from airplanes or train-jumping (I'm looking at you Fast and Furious franchise). Instead these are old school chases in the mode of Bullitt, or more precisely, Walter Hill's 1978 The Driver (Mr. Hill appears briefly here as a courtroom reporter). A heist-romance-chase film with a diverse and truly remarkable selection of songs, high energy, more than a few comedic moments (the Mike Myers mask sequence is brilliant) and a recurring Monsters, Inc quote requires a strong lead, and young Mr. Elgort aces the test. Baby is the DJ to his own life, and possesses a moral compass that others on his jobs can't comprehend. It's a heart of gold in a bad spot.Spacey plays Doc with his chilling dead-eyed stare, and even has his own moment of action sporting an automatic weapon during a violent shootout. Spacey's various crime teams (he varies the pairings) include psycho-lovebirds Buddy (Jon Hamm in his continuing effort to distance from Don Draper) and Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), Jon Bernthal, Flea, and an aptly named Bats (Jamie Foxx), who is not the clearest thinker of the bunch. Other supporting work comes courtesy of the rarely seen songwriter/actor Paul Williams, musician Sky Ferreira (as Baby's beloved mother), young Brogan Hall as Doc's talented nephew, and CJ Jones as Baby's foster father. Mr. Jones is one of the few deaf movie actors and he adds much to Baby's life outside of crime.The crucial role of Baby's love interest goes to the very talented and likable Lily James (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) as singing waitress Debora, who introduces him to Carla Thomas' 'B-A-B-Y' song, while he plays 'Debora' from T.Rex for her. She and Baby share the not overly ambitious life plan: 'to head west in a car I can't afford and a plan I don't have'. They are good together and that helps make up for the always cringe-inducing red flag of 'one last job' prior to the lovers running away together.Buried in the Miscellaneous Crew is Choreographer Ryan Heffington, who deserves at least some of the credit for the most unique and creative aspect of the presentation. This appears to be a movie fit to the music, rather than music fit to the movie. There are some astounding sequences where the drum/bass beats are right on cue with the action – gunfire, driving, and character movements. 'Harlem Shuffle' plays as Baby playfully dances past graffiti and sidewalk obstacles that perfectly match the beat and lyrics. We see what is likely the best ever movie use of 'Bellbottoms', and without question, the most creatively brilliant use of 'Hocus Pocus' by Focus. At times exhilarating to the senses, the infusion of comedy shots and new love help offset the tension of crime jobs and the thrill of the chase.",8,26,51,25 June 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," Bizarro Neo
","Greetings again from the darkness.  OK, the trilogy is over.  Neither of the sequels stand up to the fascinating and ground breaking first, but despite the script flaws and oft-lacking dialog, all three stand as tremendous action/special effects movies.  Revolutions tries to tie up the loose ends regarding purpose and especially death.  Keanu and Carrie-Ann are off screen for way too long during the battle to save the dock.  Hugo Weaving, as Mr. Smith, is again both entertaining and frightening, but he also is off screen for extended periods.  Jada Pinkett Smith looks great, but could have probably pulled off her role in the last 2 without the hours of training. She gets to flaunt very little of her powered-up body.  The best movies rely on the story and characters.  The Matrix trilogy began with an interesting story and screwed it up.  Its best characters were there til the end, but somehow we are left unfulfilled.  The action, on the other hand, is probably beyond compare up to this point in cinema.",6,0,1,9 November 2003
Man of Steel," You're the Answer, Son
","Greetings again from the darkness. 75 years ago, the first Superman comic book was published. It would be quite challenging to name very many kids who have not imagined themselves as Superman at some point during that time. Numerous Superman re-boots have occurred in various media: comics, TV, movies, video games, toys, etc., and the bigger the fan, the more etched in mind what the Man of Steel should look and act like. Woe to the filmmaker who doesn't share that fan's vision.Enter director Zack Snyder, writer David S Goyer, and writer/producer Christopher Nolan. This triumvirate has been responsible for such comic based movie material as The Dark Knight franchise, 300, Watchmen, and Blade. Some of the criticisms of this most recent Superman presentation include a lack of fun, the absence of humor, no love story, too much backstory, an overabundance of action and CGI, and a hero that is much too serious ... and that's a list ignoring the outcry over the redesigned suit sans red briefs. As with anything, the closer to the heart, the less amenable to change folks become. At least no one is complaining about the lack of phone booths!This movie has quite the balance of visual effects and backstory. It's clearly designed to be the first in a series, and because of that, we get the foundation of Superman: the rare natural born baby on the planet Krypton - a planet speeding towards destruction. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) executes his plan to save his newborn son Kal-El by rocketing him off to Earth. While that's happening, General Zod (Michael Shannon) stages one of the most ill-timed coups ever ... he tries to seize control of the dying planet. This opening sequence is filled with some of the biggest, loudest effects of the whole movie. It's a jolting start that I wasn't particularly fond of, but it's obviously well done and with purpose. Kal-El lands on earth and becomes known as Clark Kent, adopted son of Kansas farmers played by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner. Most of Clark's childhood is glimpsed through flashbacks of specific events, and serves the purpose of giving us a taste, while not delaying the appearance of Superman ... though that name is only heard once (maybe twice). In an attempt to hide his powers, Clark becomes a drifter. However, it's impossible to keep your superhero powers secret when you rescue a group of oil rig workers by using your super strength. Enter Daily Planet super-reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). She's good at her job and easily figures out the big secret. But rather than contact TMZ for a giant pay day, Lois understands that this may be something the world just isn't ready to hear. Wise lady. The relationship between Lois and Clark is rudely interrupted by the reappearance of General Zod and his right hand lady-warrior (Antje Traue). See, Zod thinks he can takeover Earth and re-establish his Krypton roots ... and Superman holds the key to his plan.If you are a Superman fan, all of this makes perfect sense. If not, I suspect this movie will not hold much interest for you. If you are a fan of the 1978 version with Christopher Reeve, I would encourage you to keep an open mind. While that version wallowed in frivolous whimsy, this one is a bit darker and more philosophical ... what you might expect from an alien with super powers. Still, the subtle humor abounds here if you keep your eyes open. LexCorp references appear along with little touches that can bring a smile (12th ranked Kansas Jayhawks football??). The acting is superb throughout. Henry Cavill was the runner-up to Daniel Craig for the James Bond role, but he immediately stakes his claim to the Man of Steel. His overall look and amazing physique leave little doubt that he is Superman, and as a bonus, he is plenty of reason for the ladies to purchase a ticket. Hans Zimmer makes no attempt to one-up John Williams' iconic score from the 1978 film, yet he makes his mark, especially during the action sequences. Be prepared as this one is heavy on the Sci-Fi angle, and there is also an interesting Jesus comparison that can be made (he is 33 years on Earth).Do the right thing has always been the recurring theme for Superman and this movie version helps us understand where the moral fiber was born ... the hint is in the Royals shirt Clark wears. In addition to a terrific Smallville set, we get Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, a role which will surely be expanded in the sequel. It's very interesting to see the Snyder, Goyer, Nolan vision, and if you are still clinging to 1978, you might ask yourself ... Why so serious?",7,1,5,19 June 2013
The Caine Mutiny," The Strawberries ... that's where I had them!
","Greetings again from the darkness. This film was nominated for seven Academy Awards (no wins), including Best Picture. Watching it today, it seems clear that the courtroom scene with Humphrey Bogart in the chair as Lt. Cmdr. Queeg drove this film to the heights it reached. That few minutes is as powerful as anything Bogart ever did on screen. Unfortunately, he would pass away (esophagal cancer) less than three years later.The first part of the film is solid enough as we meet newly graduated Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis). His first Navy assignment is aboard a minesweeper (junkyard Navy) and the veteran officers quickly note his disappointment at not being assigned to a more prestigious carrier. Those veteran officers are played by quite a list of actors: Van Johnson plays no-nonsense Lt. Steve Maryk, Fred MacMurray plays the cynical wannabe novelist Lt. Tom Keefer, and Tom Tully plays Cmdr DeVriess, who irritates young Willie with his laid back approach to command. We also see Lee Marvin and Claude Akins as part of the ship's rag-tag crew.A shift occurs once Queeg replaces DeVriess. Queeg brings a tough old school Navy approach to the ship and is easily thrown by the sight of an untucked shirt. Over a short amount of time, the officers begin taking note of the odd behavior of Queeg. MacMurray's character acts as an armchair psychologist, and more importantly, an instigator for the other officers. He is sure Queeg is unstable and unfit for duty. The climax occurs during a typhoon and Lt Maryk (Johnson) takes the abrupt step of relieving Queeg of his duties ... an action that's never actually occurred aboard a Naval ship.Soon Maryk and Willie are brought up on charges of mutiny. At about the 90 minute mark, their attorney makes his first appearance. Jose Ferrer plays Lt. Greenwald, the only naval attorney who would take the case against the highly decorated Commander. Watching Queeg (Bogart) on the stand is just about as good as acting gets. Ferrer is exceptional as well.This film is about the character of men and their reactions to situations in which they are trained to act otherwise. It's based on the WWII novel by Herman Wouk, and the screenplay is by Stanley Roberts. The film is directed by Edward Dmytryk, who you may know as one of the 'Hollywood Ten'. Dmytryk spent time in prison for his lack of cooperation with HUAC, and his previous involvement with the communist party. The score is outstanding and was composed by the famous Max Steiner, who was also responsible for a couple of other films you may have seen: Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. It should also be noted that this was the second of five total films made by Robert Francis (Ens Willie Keith). The 25 year old up and coming actor was killed in a plane crash the year after this film was made.",7,2,3,16 January 2012
Cast Away," Absolutely, positively ho-hum
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I feel cheated.  A great actor, first rate director, monster budget, the Dreamworks production team and a tropical island, and all that results is a two and a half hour commercial for FedEx. Is this where our movies are headed?  Tom Hanks should feel cheated too.  He takes a year off to lose weight and grow hair, and he gets to throw a spear and lay on a wooden raft.  Please.  On a positive note, Zemekis does provide us with a wonderfully executed plane crash sequence.  I felt like I was THERE as Hanks struggles for air.  Hanks has developed into a remarkable actor.  In the few scenes with other people, his skills overwhelm every one of them - including Helen Hunt.  Why the need to skip FOUR years?  The cheap stunt to make us feel Hanks' desperation from the previous year could easily have been a remarkable scene in the movie.  My tidbit on this one involves Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx playing himself in one scene.  Was this his price to have his company's brand stamped all over this film?  Or did he receive endorsement funds and have his ego stroked?  Overall, this is a very mediocre movie, that proves with enough money, even mediocrity can be slickly filmed.",6,0,2,26 December 2000
The Village," What color is your poncho?
","Greetings again from the darkness.  We can always count on director M. Night Shyamalan for two things: a twist and a cameo.  Regretably, 'The Village' has a much more interesting cameo than twist.  Similar to 'The Sixth Sense', Night once again flashes his fetish for the color RED.  I must admit the best use of red in the movie is Bryce Dallas Howard's beautiful head of hair.  She has a very unique look, but does a wonderful job of carrying this film.  Shyamalan favorite Joaquin Phoenix (the artist formerly known as Leaf) does a decent job of playing the sensitive guy amongst a bunch of goofy self-imposed castaways.  However, this is no 3 hour tour gone awry. These idiots actually designed the village and the twist will leave you scratching your head as if to say both 'Why?' and 'Is that it?'.  As usual, some nice camera work, but the dialogue borders on hoakey most of the time. Oscar winner Adrien Brody is downright creepy in his role and I am still not sure what to make of veterans William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.  Anyway, not much of a thriller and at times comical, though not purposefully so. Great violin work throughout.",6,0,1,19 August 2004
21," No Chicken Dinner For You
","Greetings again from the darkness. Fascinating real life story based on the book by Ben Mezrich gets slick, polished Hollywood treatment from well known fluff director Robert Luketic ('Legally Blonde', 'Mother-In-Law').For some reason the MIT students racial mix is much different than the real life stuff. Wait, I believe that reason would be Box Office appeal/money!! Kevin Spacey is a fine choice for the ego-maniacal professor who is the brains behind the brainy operation that takes Vegas for a ride. Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth are the eye candy inserted to make this tolerable for a wider audience.The actual guy whose Sturgess' character is based on, Jeffrey Ma, has a quick role as a Planet Hollywood dealer. Throw in Laurence Fishbourne as an old school security muscle man, mix it with some slow-mo and fast edits and loud music and you have Hollywood's idea of high-tech Gen Y thriller. My advice ... read the book.",6,4,7,30 March 2008
The Revenant," Leo and Snow and Bears, Oh My!
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'Keep breathing.' A flashback in the opening sequence has Hugh Glass whispering the phrase as advice to his young son Hawk, the product of Glass and his beloved Pawnee bride. The phrase has a recurring role throughout the film  possibly serving as a courtesy reminder from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu to the moviegoers mesmerized (and nearly traumatized) by the incredible brutality of what is on screen.It's a master class in filmmaking by those at the top of their game. Inarritu is the reigning Oscar winning director for Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), and he has re-teamed with the reigning Oscar winning cinematographer from that movie, Emmanuel Lubezki. Two of the finest actors of their generation, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, strip away any semblance of pampered movie stardom to deliver ultra-realistic performances in a story 'based in part' on the true to life novel by Michael Punke.An early action sequence is startling in its ferocity as Arikara surround and attack a group of hunters and trappers, and the whoosh of arrows – many of which find their mark – abruptly drag us into a world that we are unfamiliar with and certainly unprepared for. It's early 19th century U.S. frontier, and just about everyone and everything can kill you. Providing just enough time for us to pry our fingers off the armrests, Inarritu stuns us with what is undoubtedly the most fantastic grizzly bear attack on a movie star ever filmed. In what appears to be a single take (which also happens to be the number of breaths I took), Mama Grizzly treats Leonardo the way a young puppy treats its first chew toy. Scratched, chewed, tossed and stomped. This scene is savage and brutal, and sets the stage for the true, yet still unbelievable odyssey of survival by frontiersman Hugh Glass.Tom Hardy excels as the calmly psychotic villain Fitzgerald, though some of his early hillbilly-tinged dialogue is difficult to catch. His hulking presence fits with our imagined look of the frontiersman of the era  tough and unforgiving nearly beyond belief. His bullying of youngster Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter) and power struggles with Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) are at frightening levels of intensity. Fans of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds will smile as they recognize the name of mountain man Jim Bridger  though that's one of the few smiles offered by this 156 minute gut-wrenching ordeal. It would not be surprising if DiCaprio's mantel sports an Oscar in a few months. He is that superb in a role that has nothing to do with good looks or charm.A tale of survival. A quest for revenge. It's both of those, as well as a reminder that nature can be both beautiful and brutal. Some of the photography is almost poetic, and often reminds of the work of director Terrence Malick. And in the blink of an eye, that moment is shattered by the torrential force of river rapids carrying Glass over the waterfall, or his taking a horseback ride off a steep cliff (one of the most dramatic shots of the film). The journey of Glass is unknown in distance or time in the movie, but there is no question as to the numerous struggles with the elements and the raw physicality required to persevere. If you can avoid diverting your eyes, there are visuals here that will be sincerely appreciated – even as you squirm, cringe and moan throughout.From a technical standpoint, the film was shot on location in Canada and Argentina using only natural lighting, and emphasizing aspects of nature that often are overlooked. The sound of arrows, bears, and even DiCaprio's breathing are profound and crucial to the overall effect, as are the animal skin garments and other costumes. It's impossible to tell where CGI meets reality, but the visceral experience will be quite unique for most viewers  and not soon forgotten.",9,14,34,23 December 2015
Trouble with the Curve," Peanuts, PC's, and Seven
","Greetings again from the darkness. Combining my two favorite things in life (excluding family), baseball movies always give me pause. It is impossible for me to watch without analyzing the baseball (which rarely comes across well on screen) and often looking away in disgust. Fortunately, this one is as much about clogging as it is baseball. Baseball is merely the setting for this otherwise quite conventional family drama.Clint Eastwood plays Gus, an aging old-time baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. Gus has his way of scouting and it doesn't include computers or any other aspect of 'Moneyball'. He believes in what he sees. Therein lies his biggest problem. His eyesight is failing at a time when scouting newcomers are leaning on sabermetrics. It's Gus' last chance to scout a hotshot prospect before the team offers him retirement.Gus' boss is played by John Goodman, who guilts Gus' estranged daughter into making the final scouting trip with her father. The problem is that Mickey (Amy Adams) is a rising star attorney with a shot at firm partnership. Predictably she makes the trip. Matthew Lillard plays the new wave scout who believes only in what the computer metrics tell him. It's a clash of old vs new.On the trip, we meet Johnny 'Flame' played by Justin Timberlake. He's a former phenom scouted by Gus, who later blew out his arm. Johnny is now working as a scout and hoping for a broadcasting career. Adams and Timberlake have the necessary cuteness to offset the gruffness of Clint. See, everybody learns life lessons and baseball from everybody else. For those wondering, Gus named his daughter after Mickey Mantle. She should just be glad her name isn't Seven (that's for Seinfeld fans).Clint had previously announced that Gran Torino would be his final acting job. We can only presume that this is a favor for his long time producer, and first time director Robert Lorenz. Lorenz runs Malpaso, Eastwood's film production company. Eastwood plays a similar role this time out, as he is grumpy and lonely and growls a lot. He also tosses out a few funny quips and doesn't shy away from displaying the many downsides to aging.You have probably figured out that this is a corny, predictable, mainstream film. You should also know that it is entertaining enough and easily accessible, though I presume the baseball theme will keep many away. My only real issue is that the lead characters are just 'too'. Clint is too gruff. Amy Adams is too earnest. Timberlake is too eager. Lillard is too dastardly. This makes for a pretty simple movie with no twists you won't see coming way ahead of time. That is, unless you have the same vision problems as Gus.OK, I'll finish with this ... Clint obviously respects empty chairs more than coffee tables. One he simply argues with. The other he gets violent. (an early scene) www.moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com",6,5,15,22 September 2012
Bridge of Spies," Would it help?
","Greetings again from the darkness. For a director, true power in the movie industry means you can obtain the financing and assemble the cast and crew you need to make the films that have meaning to you. With his 40 year career of unmatched combined box office and critical success, Steven Spielberg is the epitome of film power and the master of bringing us dramatized versions of historical characters and events. In his fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, Spielberg tells the story of James B Donovan.You say you aren't familiar with Mr. Donovan? In the late 1950's and early 1960's, the CIA (Allen Dulles was director at the time) persuaded James Donovan to provide a bit of Cold War legal service. Mr. Donovan was by trade an Insurance attorney, but after others in his profession passed on the 'opportunity', his commitment to justice and human rights drove him to accept the challenge of defending suspected Russian spy named Rudolph Abel. In the face of an angry populace and government, Donovan took the case all the way to the Supreme Court – and his exact words are spoken in the movie by Hanks.Not long after, Francis Powers (played by Austin Stowell) was piloting a CIA U-2 spy plane when he was shot down over Russia and taken captive. This sequence in the film is breathtaking to watch. Enter James Donovan again  this time to negotiate an exchange of prisoners: Rudolph Abel for Francis Powers. It's these negotiations that provide the element of suspense in the story. Mr. Donovan was a family man, but he was also very confident in his ability to negotiate on the biggest stage and under the brightest spotlight (or darkest backroom).The movie is exactly what you would expect from a master filmmaker. Spielberg re-creates the era through sets, locations, and costumes. He utilizes his remarkable eye behind the camera, an interesting use of lighting, and the score from Thomas Newman. Nope, that's not a misprint. It's the first Spielberg movie in 30 years not scored by John Williams (who was unable to work on the project). Of course, the cast is stellar and it all starts with Tom Hanks. He just makes everything look so darn easy! Whether he is talking to his wife (Amy Ryan), his kids (including Bono's daughter Eve Hewson), his law partner (Alan Alda), or agents from the U.S. or Russia  Hanks manages to make each scene real and believable.It's the scenes between Donovan and Rudolph Abel that are the most fascinating to watch. Mark Rylance plays Abel, and to see these two men grow to respect each other for 'doing their job' is a true acting and screen writing clinic. We find ourselves anxious for the next Rudolph Abel scene during an extended span where the focus is on Donovan's negotiations. When the two finally reunite, it's a quietly affecting moment where much is said with few words.Spielberg utilized many of the locations where the actual events took place, and this includes Berlin and the Glienicke Bridge where the real exchange took place in 1962. While missing the labyrinth of twists and turns of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, it's knowing that these are real people in real situations that make this historic drama so thrilling and riveting to watch. Film lovers will also get a kick out of the fact that the script was co-written by the Coen Brothers, and history lovers will enjoy seeing some of the details provided by the written words of those involved, as well as their surviving family members. It's an era that seems so long ago, yet the topics are so pertinent to what's happening in the world today. Beyond all of that, it's a story of a man standing up for what's right at a time when that was not the easy or popular way.",8,4,10,16 October 2015
Split," the return of M Night
","Greetings again from the darkness. As a filmmaker, the public's expectations become a burden rather than a blessing once you write and director back-to-back movies like The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000). M Night Shyamalan has never been able to replicate the box office or critical success that he enjoyed with those two films  but, oh how he has tried. It's this latest that finally makes us believe he is at least having fun again.James McAvoy plays Dennis and Patricia and Hedwig and  well  he plays a guy with 23 distinct personalities. As you might imagine, some of these personalities are nicer than others, while some are stronger in their fight for the spotlight. As Dennis, a button-upped neat freak, he captures 3 teenage girls and holds them captive. At first, the purpose is a bit murky, but the delay does allow the girls to meet some of the personalities.The girls are Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who was so good in The Witch), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson from The Bronze), and Marcia (Jessica Sula). Claire and Marcia are the popular girls who react with typical teenage emotions, while Casey pushes for patience and observation. It's Casey who may be the film's most interesting character as childhood flashbacks occur that are first thought to explain her survival skills, but soon enough disclose a darker, more unfortunate past. The younger Casey is coolly played by newcomer Izzie Coffey, and holds her own with Sebastian Arcelus (her dad) and Brad William Henke (her Uncle John).The always terrific Betty Buckley is outstanding as Dr Fletcher, the psychologist treating McAvoy's character(s). Ms. Buckley adds class and a connection to the real world that gives us hope for the future of the girls being held. McAvoy really seems to be enjoying the acting challenge and shape-shifting that accompanies this mental disorder, and he will likely creep you out a few times. Cinematographer Mike Gioukakis was a key to the look and mood of It Follows, and his camera work here is superb in mostly confined areas. Sure, the whole thing is preposterous, but it's fun and wicked  and with this director, you can expect a surprise or twist – even after all these years.",7,2,12,27 January 2017
Cold Mountain," Awright Then ... a rooster, a goat, a fiddle and Zeger
","Greetings again from the darkness.  My first movie of 2004 has already shown up on most critic's top 10 list for last year so my expectations were high, yet tempered with the knowledge that director Anthony Minghella was responsible for 'The English Patient' (the focus of one of the funniest 'Seinfeld' episodes).  What an unbelievable cast Minghella assembled.  Every scene brought a recognizable star.  However, as feared, the story is excruciatingly predictable throughout.  The wonderful performances make the movie quite watchable, but never should such a predictable story land on a best movie list of any respectable film lover.  Surprisingly, Renee' Zellweger is most impressive in her quite less-than-glamourous role while firing off one liners to pick up the pace in the painfully slow dialogue. The stellar cast includes the leads, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman and the celebrity baggage associated.  Young stars such as Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Giovanni Ribisi and Charlie Hunnam ('Nicolas Nickelby') are joined by screen vets such as Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson and the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Especially effective and creepy is Hunnam.  Biggest question I have is, why so many foreign actors in a civil war picture?  The battle scenes are filmed wonderfully and the countryside alternates between beautiful and stark and with hope and desperation.  Law and Kidman are fine in the leads, but really have little to do other than look longingly into the lens.  While Minghella knows how to craft a beautiful film, he has yet to figure out how to write a unique screenplay.",7,0,1,3 January 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Super Freak
","Greetings again from the darkness. For some reason I have anticipated this one since the first trailer. Funny, charming and heartfelt, it is written by Michael Arndt with amazing depth. As bizarre as the characters are, we never once doubt that they are a family and belong together.Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are excellent as Olive's parents and Alan Arkin is electric as the grandpa who teaches Olive 'the moves' for her big dance. Steve Carell ('The Office' and 'The Forty Year Old Virgin') is perfectly creepy as the uncle/brother who is thrust into this community after his failed suicide attempt. His explanation of that at the dinner table is sharply written and brilliantly delivered. Paul Dano ('Taking Lives' and 'The Emperor's Club') would steal most movies with his performance. He perfectly captures the tortured soul of most teenage boys. The reason he doesn't walk away with the film is Abigail Breslin who plays Olive. Most remember her aluminum foil headgear in 'Signs', and here she is simply magnificent as the ever-optimistic girl who is so looking forward to the pageant.There is a line in the film about life being a series of never ending beauty pageants. Sadly there is a great deal of truth in that. Watching this family travel together and grow together is painful and rewarding; however, trust me when I say it will not motivate you to buy a VW van and travel cross-country with your family! One of the better films of the year so far, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is what happens on film when a wonderful script and talented cast come together. It's not about the special effects, it's about real people and real life.",8,0,3,13 August 2006
North by Northwest," Dustin' Crops where there ain't no Crops
","Greetings again from the darkness. It seems apropos that Hollywood's first stylish thriller with tongue planted firmly in cheek should come from director Alfred Hitchcock. We get two of the most iconic scenes in one film: Cary Grant being targeted by a crop duster, and the chase across the faces of Mt Rushmore. That combined with the stellar writing of famed screenwriter Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, The Sound of Music) provide one the all-time most entertaining and beloved thrillers.Cary Grant plays Roger O Thornhill (the O stands for nothing), a Madison Avenue Advertising hotshot who gets mixed up in a wild case of mistaken identity that involves the CIA and an unnamed foreign intelligence agency. Spies who nab the wrong guy ... there's something funny about that, as long as you aren't 'the guy'. The story is tied into the Cold War, but really the fun part of the film involves watching Thornhill maneuver his way through the maze with very little assistance. Well Eve Kendall (played by Eva Marie Saint) says she is helping, but it doesn't take long to figure out that she's no innocent bystander ... what blonde ever is innocent in a Hitchcock film? The bad guy is Vandamm, played with true menace by James Mason (whose wonderfully creepy voice always made him a terrific villain). His henchman is a young Martin Landau, whose mannerisms will have you raising an eyebrow throughout. While many rave about the scenes with Grant and Ms. Saint, my favorites involve Grant and Mason. Two suave masters going at each other with verbal sparring that stands up more than 50 years later.This was Hitchcock's only film for MGM, and I would argue it is his most visually stylish ... clothing, set decorations and the beautiful scenery and camera work. Of course, one can't help notice the poor gray suit that Grant wears through most of the film. It looks fabulous on him, even after he crawls out of the corn fields. Mr. Grant may be the most elegant actor to ever grace the silver screen. He moves like a dancer and has the face of model. This is a true movie star. I have often stated that he mastered the confounded grimace and the quick, sly smile and he built a career.Bernard Herrmann delivered yet another perfect score and Lehman's risqué' (for the times) dialogue is especially fun in the train's dining car. Finally getting to see this one on the big screen gave me a whole new appreciation for the crop dusting scene and Mt Rushmore. The scale of both segments is pure Hitchcock art. On a final note, there are so many character actors whom you will recognize throughout the film. Many went on to long careers in the 60's and 70's and even beyond. A true classic from the master.",9,0,0,19 July 2012
Hugo," Through the Eyes behind the Face
","Greetings again from the darkness. This latest from Martin Scorsese can be fitted with multiple labels and each would be correct: a tribute to the birth of movies, a case for film preservation, a children's fable, a special effects/3D extravaganza, a family movie with touches of Dickens. Very few directors would tackle such an ambitious project and succeed in producing such a magical experience.Based on Brian Selznick's (relative to the film giant David O. Selznick)children's book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', this is a story of redemption and fulfillment. Asa Butterfield plays Hugo, made an orphan when his watchmaker father (Jude Law) dies in a fire. Hugo gathers up the project he and his dad had been working on, and he moves in with his drunkard Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone). They live in the walls of a 1930's Paris train station and maintain all the clocks, ensuring accurate time. When his uncle disappears, Hugo carries on the daily mission unseen by passengers and station staff. He steals the occasional croissant and milk to survive, all while continuing the mission of repairing the automaton his dad salvaged. Hugo is convinced there is a hidden message from his father that will be revealed when the automaton is fully functioning.Hugo gets cross-ways with a station toy vendor named Georges, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. Georges is a bitter old man and has no time for Hugo the urchin. Chloe Moretz plays Isabelle, a ward unto Georges, and she and Hugo strike up a friendship. Hugo introduces Isabelle to the world of cinema ... previously off-limits to her thanks to Georges. She returns the favor by awakening Hugo to the power of books in a store run by the mysterious, and always great, Christopher Lee. All this is happening while Hugo tries to evade the grasp of the oddly dedicated and slightly twisted station inspector played by Sacha Baron Cohen.The kids' research and automaton revealed hint lead them to a film history book written by Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg). It's here that they discover Georges is really George Melies, the famous pioneer of film who developed the first special effects and studio system. If you know much of film history, then you recognize Melies as the one who brought us the 1902 'A Trip to the Moon'. It is here that Scorsese delivers a quick recap of the origination of film, including the Lumiere Brothers, the famous clock stunt by Harold Lloyd and other silent film classics like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. The best portion is dedicated to recreating the system used by Melies to produce films in his make-shift studio.It is here that we are allowed to remember just how magical movies can be and how the best ones fill us with a sense of wonderment. The lines between what we feel and what Scorsese is showing us becomes so blurred it no longer matters. As Isabelle is overwhelmed in the theatre, that same feeling sweeps over us. How interesting that Scorsese's first special effects film features the man who originated film special effects. We even get a re-creation of the famous oncoming locomotive clip that caused audiences to jump. We get it in 3D in Hugo's own station! I have been extremely critical of 3D and its misuse in movies these past couple of years. It rarely adds to the movie and always dims the colors and brightness. Scorsese is a firm believer in the technology and set out to show what can be done and how it can compliment the story. While more impressive than any 3D since Avatar, I still have my doubts about the benefits. What I do know is that if you can overlook the story that drags a bit and the unnecessary 3D effects, you will probably find the film to be quite entertaining and fun to watch. Howard Shore's score plays a vital role and supporting work comes from Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths, and Helen McCrory. It's not for the youngest kids, but it will make you feel like a kid ... while reminding you that movies are the stuff that dreams are made of.",8,6,9,28 November 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Hope that red light is out for good
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I absolutely loved the first Terminator and thought the sequel was one of the best sequels ever made (outside of 'Godfather II').  Arnold was born to play this role and seems to enjoy it. However, the act is a bit tired now - and Arnold is looking a little wrinkled for a robot.  Anyway, decent story with Nick Stahl ('In the Bedroom') as a 20 something John Conner and the always wonderful Claire Danes as the female fill in for the not present Linda Hamilton.  I am really glad Danes is acting full time again.  Although it has been almost 10 years since her TV breakout, she is just now coming in to her own as an actress. 'The Hours' and 'Igby Goes Down', along with this performance show she is trying to find her niche.  Very skilled and not bad to look at, the next few roles are crucial to her career as either a star or character actress.  I just hope she continues to produce quality turns.  Model Kristanna Loken is the T-X, or Terminatrix (get it?) who is after John Conner.  A far more powerful and efficient killing machine than Arnold, but somehow she continually falls just short.  Not sure how director Johnathan Mostow ('U-571') lucked into this gig, but at least he doesn't muck it up.  This is just a story that has had its day and should be appreciated for what it gave us.  Let Arnold run for office and let Hollywood move on.",6,0,1,18 July 2003
The Orphanage," Paradise by the Lighthouse Light
","Greetings again from the darkness. We are blessed with so few horror movies for grown-ups because it is a nearly impossible genre to succeed in. There is such a fine line between suspense and stupidity, and to succeed there must be an air of believability. This film manages to walk the high wire and maintain the balance ... to the point of a few good scares and more than enough suspense! Produced by the great Guillermo del Toro and directed by Spain's new hot shot director, Juan Antonio Bayona, the film has some very basic, even cliché, story lines and premises. Still the quality is so high and the acting so strong that it does suck the viewer right into this world. The simplistic approach is what makes it work. The house creaks, clanks and other noises are extraordinarily creepy and not over the top. The best moments are the 'little' things and I really enjoyed Geraldine Chaplin's time as the medium.OK, it is a horror movie, but this is a very good performance from Bolen Rueda, who was so memorable in 'The Sea Inside'. Ms. Rueda is Laura, who wants to set up a house for a few needy kids in the same house in which she lived as an orphan when she was a kid. Guess what? There is more to the story than that! Laura's own adopted son is played by the extraordinarily cute Roger Princep as Simon. Big eyes and bushy hair, he is like a living (or maybe not) doll.It is so difficult for these films to find an audience, especially when released in the U.S. with sub-titles, but this one deserves attention to anyone who enjoys a little suspense and a few good darkened theatre jumps in the seat!",7,6,11,12 January 2008
The Alamo," not just fiddlin' around
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Having grown up in San Antonio and lived in Texas most of my life, I was quite anxious and apprehensive about this movie.  When news first broke a few years ago regarding this project, Ron Howard was listed as the director and I could not have been more relieved. His treatment of 'Apollo 13' was nothing short of outstanding.  A few months ago, when the delay in release was announced, I found out Howard was no longer directing and the reins had been turned over to Hancock.  It was then I began to worry.  Sure enough, the obvious weakness in this film is the inconsistent direction and chopiness of the story.  On the other hand, the lead actors are all fantastic!  Patrick Wilson as Travis is just how the stories were told.  Jason Patric brings Jim Bowie (and is extremely impressive knife) to life.  Dennis Quaid does an OK job as Sam Houston, although maybe a bit heavy handed in his approach.  No question, though, that the movie and story belong to Billy Bob Thornton as Davy (he prefers David) Crockett and Emilio Echevarria as Santa Ana.  The arrogance of Santa Ana is chillingly portrayed and Billy Bob continues to prove that he is one of the best actors in the world.  He becomes his characters.  The crucial battle scene (portrayed accurately as being in the dark) is done fairly well, but the bravery and destiny of those involved is heart-breaking.  I would have loved to have seen Ron Howard's version, but am impressed with the accuracy of the storyline of Hancock's film.",7,19,31,16 April 2004
Wanted," What have you done lately?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Combine 'Sin City' and the 'Bourne' series, toss in some humor and add a significant amount of violence and action and you get director Timur Bekmambetov's film version of Mark Millar's comic book.Suspension of belief is a requirement for enjoying this movie, but if you can do that, it is actually a good bit of fun. James McAvoy in his first action hero role, while Angelina Jolie is utilized to perfection. By that I mean, she smirks a lot and prowls around like a panther flashing that very unique face and body of hers. Think of her in 'Gone in 60 Seconds' and 'Mr and Mrs Smith' ... not a lot of dialogue, but plenty of fast action. McAvoy proves to be a good mix of ultimate slacker in the beginning and transformed assassin by the mid point.The basis of the story is actually very creative. McAvoy is the lone offspring of the world's deadliest assassin, but he is stuck in a office cubicle being bullied by his fat, female boss at work and humiliated by his not-impressed girlfriend at home. The rest of the film features him trying to find out who he really is. Well, actually he spends the rest of the film learning to unleash the assassin buried inside! The action scenes are stellar and push the envelope. The opening sequence featuring David O'Hare ('The Departed') is one of the coolest scenes you will find. Also impressive is the longest train wreck ever presented on film. Lending a hand in all of this is Morgan Freeman as the leader of the Fraternity, rapper Common as an assassin, Terence Stamp in a brief, but crucial role, and the under-appreciated Thomas Kretschmann ('King Kong', 'U-571') as the rogue assassin everyone is out to kill. All of this is capped off with an excellent Danny Elfman score and some Nine Inch Nails headbanging.",6,2,6,28 June 2008
Warrior," Rock 'em Sock 'em Brothers
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's always a bit thrilling when a movie catches us off-guard and is much more than expected. Walking in, I was all set for a testosterone fueled fight fest featuring BS bravado and mounds of machismo. While that element is abundantly present, writer/director Gavin O'Connor wraps the fighting around a pretty interesting story about family, bravery, desperation, pride and forgiveness.The story begins with the convergence of a broken family - two brothers and their father. The split occurred many years ago, and without the details, we are able to piece together that dad (Nick Nolte) was a violent drunken ex-Marine and the mother planned to take the two boys and run. One of the brothers (Joel Edgerton) had fallen in love and decided to stay with dad. The other brother (Tom Hardy) went with mom and even nursed her through her final days of cancer prior to his joining the Marines. The three men have been incommunicado for years, until one day Tommy (Hardy) shows up on Nolte's doorstep.What sets this one apart is the details of each of the brother's stories, very little of which I will discuss here. There is a terrific scene on the Atlantic City beach where their demons confront each other and we see that so much pain and bitterness exists despite their having been teenagers at the time of the split. They each felt abandoned by the other. Now one is an angry ex-Marine and the other is a desperate physics teacher with a family. This story couldn't possibly end any place other than smack in the middle of an MMA cage fight! Their Dad (Nolte) had trained the boys as youth wrestlers and now a giant $5 million tournament is being held. Both brothers are carrying secrets and need money to solve their problems. Their secrets drive them to risk life and limb in the cage of this most brutal activity. To best describe these characters, Tom Hardy has the presence and physique of the guy you would never consider confronting in a bar fight. Joel Edgerton is the kind that your buddies would egg you on thinking you could probably take him. Instead you would end up in the back of an ambulance.As expected, and shown in the trailer, the MMA tournament ends with the two brothers facing off and guilt-riddled dad watching from the crowd. Despite the rowdiness and violence of the fighting, very little blood is shown. That's not what this movie is about. Instead we get many adrenaline-rushes from the spectacle of the fights, plus a montage of the training leading up to the big moment. This is a crowd-pleaser in the vein of 'The Fighter', but not quite as mainstream given the MMA element.The two leads were each on my list of favorite movies last year. Joel Edgerton was in the excellent and under-the-radar 'Animal Kingdom', while Tom Brady was in the mega-hit 'Inception' and will play Bane in the upcoming Batman film. In this film, Edgerton has more freedom with his character, but Brady does a wonderful job of capturing the quiet intensity followed by roid rage in the ring. Most surprising is the fine job turned in by Nick Nolte. He really showed up for this one. Other support work comes from Jennifer Morrison, Kevin Dunn and Frank Grillo. We also see former Olympic wrester Kurt Angle as the terrifying Russian MMA machine Yoba, and writer/director Gavin O'Connor as JJ Riley, the millionaire sponsoring the tournament.There will be comparisons made to both 'Rocky' and 'The Fighter' and both make sense. It is not quite at that level, but don't mistake this as some dumb fight movie made for teenage boys. There is a story and it provides further proof that men, no matter how hard they try, manage to screw up the whole family thing more often than not ... but in the end, they do try their best to make things better!",8,3,8,12 September 2011
Salt," The Russians are Coming!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Remember the Alamo! Remember the Cold War! OK, the Alamo has nothing to do with this, but if you can remember Russia as a superpower and the bad guy whom the U.S. spent years and billions trying to out-spy and out-defend, then this story might makes some sense to you. Of course, the story matters little here. What matters is the action and it is actually pretty intense and well done.Angelina Jolie has always reminded me of the scene in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' when Strother Martin is testing out Sundance's shooting skills. When Sundance misses the first target, he asks 'Can I move?'. He then proves he is much better when he moves. Angelina is the same. In her films that let her 'move', she is amazing. Think 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' vs. 'Changeling'. The first she seems a natural. The second she came across as miscast. In this film, she does things no human being could do, but does these things with such commitment, that we actually believe she is capable. Her actions often border on parkour ... especially when in an elevator shaft or a freeway, and we accept these stunts because it's Angelina.Support work is provided by Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, both who spend much of the movie trying to figure out how Angelina does the things she does ... surrounded by their teams of weapons experts. Most of the time, the way she is outnumbered leaves you thinking that if she gets out of this jam, this movie is just stupid. But once she has escaped, you just feel a little more pumped up! That's a sign of a good action movie.Sure, the story is ridiculous at most points and the plot holes are more canyons than holes, but it's kind of nice to re-visit the double or triple spy days, especially when it's placed within daring stunts and chases that work.The director of this is Phillip Noyce, who is best known for a couple of the Tom Clancy adaptations - 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger'. Mr. Noyce got me hooked 20 years ago on a little film called 'Dead Calm', starring a very young Nicole Kidman. That is a taut little thriller that takes place mostly on a sail boat in the middle of the ocean. If you've never seen it, you should.So in regards to 'Salt', I will say that it's a fun action-thriller in a twisty little cold war spy setting. Don't get caught up in the plot details and just enjoy the action sequences by Angelina Jolie. Not very often I recommend ignoring a faulty script, but I actually enjoyed this one.",6,5,12,24 July 2010
Duck Soup," A Gal A Day
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 20-25 years since I last watched this one, so catching it on the big screen was a real treat. I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman.Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of.The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous 'mirror' scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious 'hat scene' with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement.The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being 'Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free'.Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the 'comedy straight man'. How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending.The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!",9,1,2,9 August 2012
Disturbia," Tower of Twinkies
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director DJ Caruso lapses into the same thing here that prevented his 'Two For the Money' from being better. The interaction between characters, including the exchange of dialogue, just doesn't flow naturally. We never escape the feeling that these are actors reading their lines.That said, this was a better film than expected. Sure, it is a blatant rip-off of Hitchcock's classic 'Rear Window'. The only things missing are a wheelchair (an electronic ankle monitor instead) and the fabulous wardrobe of Grace Kelly (replaced here by the tight jeans of Sarah Roemer). Of course, Jimmy Stewart's telephoto lens from the original has been given a high-tech face lift utilizing computers and digital movie cameras. Regardless of the changes, the story remains the same. Shia LaBeouf is a teenager under house arrest for slugging a teacher who asked for it. To prevent boredom, LaBeouf 'observes' his neighbors and stumbles on what appears to be a very bad guy next door played by the eternally (and wrongfully) stereotyped David Morse. LaBeouf manages to draw a couple of others into his web, most notably his beautiful new neighbor (Roemer), who reads on the roof, dips in the pool and yogas in front of her open windows. In other words, a peepers best friend!Nothing to give away here because there are no real surprises. That is what's missing! How about a twist? Instead, every one in the movie is exactly as first presented to us. Where is the filmmaker sleight-of-hand? Where is the blind side? Those are the things that make a successful thriller. Still, LaBeouf shows some acting potential and could develop into a star if the vehicle is ever just right. Playing his mom here is the terrific Carrie-Anne Moss ('The Matrix'), but she is really given little to do. What I really wish is that someone would cast Mr. Morse in a role where he can really stretch a bit. The guy is a good actor but these days is relegated to playing the strong, silent bad guys. Whatever happened to 'St. Elsewhere'?",6,6,18,14 April 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," Excelsior Strategy
","Greetings again from the darkness. The film is exactly what you would expect from a screwball romantic comedy steeped in drama based on bipolar disorder, depression, OCD, Philadelphia Eagles fanatics, a ballroom dancing contest, adultery, Hemingway, and a lead character who jogs while wearing a trash bag. Maybe not exactly what you would expect, but more likely much more.If you were told instead that the story is based on two damaged souls who help heal each other through dancing, you would have every reason to skip this one. However, as written and directed by David O Russell (The Fighter) and based on Matthew Quick's novel, this story is a frenetic, emotional roller coaster ride that provides a glimmer of hope for the two damaged lead characters, while reminding that each of us may be a bit off-center in some way. Now add in the best young actress working today (Jennifer Lawrence just turned 22), a rare performance from Robert DeNiro where he seems fully engaged, a pulling back the curtain on Bradley Cooper as much more than a pretty face, and one of the best and most precise soundtracks in recent history ... now you have one of the best films of the year.What you notice very early on is that what could be considered a trite story line, is instead pounding you with sharp, witty dialogue that pulls no punches in directness. The many aspects of family and emotional support are given time thanks to Pat (Bradley Cooper) being released after 8 months in a mental institution. He was sent there when he snapped after finding his wife in a compromising position with another man. Perfectly understandable if you ask me, but clearly he is the explosive one despite his claims to the contrary. An uncomfortable dinner party introduces him to Tiffany (Ms. Lawrence) whose husband has recently died and her coping skills have been shared with most of those in her workplace. This odd couple spark immediately and the wild ride begins.Pat's wife Nikki (Brea Bee) has issued a restraining order and Pat's strategy to win her back involves a positive attitude and maintaining control of his emotions. His supporters include his mother (Jacki Weaver, who was so great in Animal Kingdom), his OCD father (DeNiro) who so wants to re-connect with his son, his friend (John Ortiz) whose own marriage (to icy Julia Stiles) is a messy mess, his buddy from the asylum (a funny and not over the top Chris Tucker), and of course, Tiffany. The only real problem is that each of these supporters are teetering in their own way just like Pat.The brilliance of this movie is the balance struck between the near violent emotional outbursts and the sharp, exacting words spouted by each of the characters. Director Russell once again shows his flair for working class northeasterners. He understands these tough as nails people who wear their emotions on their sleeves. These people are as likely to punch you as hug you ... and both are acts of love.The soundtrack deserves special mention. It is very unique and varied, with each song serving an exact purpose. Especially keen are Stevie Wonder's 'My Cherie Amour', Led Zeppelin's 'What is and What Should Be', and 'The Girl from the North Country' a Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash duet. When the music strikes a harmony with the scene, the movie is all the stronger. Rarely do we get the perfect storm of script, direction, acting, music and relevance.",8,217,310,24 November 2012
The White Ribbon," No Simple Who-Dunnit
","Greetings again from the darkness. There have been many films with troubled communities: 'The Village', 'Wicker Man', 'Children of the Corn', and 'Stepford Wives' to name a few. None of these compare to the pre-World War I rural German village that director Michael Haneke plops us into.Haneke is the master of keeping the viewer guessing and never really allowing us a clean solution to the mysteries he presents. Did you figure out what motivated the cruelty from the boys in 'Funny Games'? Did you ever really figure out who or why the family was being videotaped in 'Cache'? The same holds true here.The story is told by the voice-over from the school teacher many years later. We only see the village and the residents as 'things' happen - through the recollections of the teacher. Haneke presents many suspects, but no answers to all of the 'accidents' and foul play that occurs. We witness only the aftermath and the distrust of the close community.The film is up for Best Foreign Film and the stark, bleak, black & white look will put you on edge and create a feeling of discomfort, even in the somewhat happiest moments of the film. No doubt it will frustrate those who need a clean wrap-up, but those who enjoy discussion and debate will need an extra cup of coffee afterward to go through all the what-ifs.",8,1,5,20 February 2010
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Sibling Assassins
","Greetings again from the darkness. The movie begins with a tip of the cap to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale and then spins off into what would be just another episode of TV's 'Once Upon a Time', were it a cable rather than a network show.The original fairy tale is a nightmare for most kids (probably explains why it's one of my favorites). Hansel and Gretel are deserted in the forest by their parents, and end up at a scrumptious house of candy owned by a witch who eats children. The movie puts an interesting spin on why the parents got rid of the kids, but mostly this story begins after Hansel and Gretel outsmart the candy house witch. This leads them into a joint career of bounty-hunting for witches.Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Avengers) plays Hansel and Gemma Arterton (Tamara Drewe, Bond Girl in Casino Royale) plays Gretel. They have some pretty nifty weapons given that it's the middle ages. Mostly they take turns getting the stuffing kicked out of them by witches and jealous sheriffs.There is a good witch and bad witch element as well as a discovery of their childhood roots. That said, the plot and story are secondary thanks to writer/director Tommy Wickola who seems to find the most joy in exploding witch heads and bodies. The 3D seems pretty sloppy and forced with no added benefit. A couple of humorous additions involve Hansel's struggle with diabetes (thanks to the candy house), the missing kid notices on milk bottles, and the multi-dimensional troll Edward ... he's no Shrek, but it doesn't take much personality to stand out here.Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are listed as producers and that explains the attempts at humor throughout. It's too bad the overkill on gore and profanity prevent this from being an intelligent spin off from one of the best ever fairy tales.",5,3,9,27 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Comes forth with the Thaw
","Greetings again from the darkness. The character of Lisbeth Salander absolutely fascinates me. That's true whether we are discussing Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy novels, the Swedish film versions, or this latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from Steve Zaillian. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara. She is a brilliant character hiding in plain sight from a world that has fiercely mistreated her, and now misjudges and underestimates her. She is the oddest heroine I can recall ... and I can't get enough of her.Let's start with the source material. Stieg Larsson's books are far from perfect, but addictive just the same. The first book (on which this film is based) is, at its core, a simple who-dunnit presented in a manner that is claustrophobic, paranoid and eerie. Moving on to this particular film, we find the director and screenplay holding the basic tone while making a few changes ... some minor, others more substantial. These changes may irk those fans who are a bit more loyal to the books, but Fincher surely wanted to offer more than a simple re-telling of the story.Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist hired to solve the 40 year old mystery of the disappearance/murder of Harriet Vanger, niece to Swedish millionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). To research, Blomkvist must dig into the Vanger's rotten family tree of Nazis, anti-Semites, sexual predators, anti-social fanatics, and a few just plain loony birds. You can imagine how excited this rich and once powerful family is to have someone uncovering long buried secrets. Circumstances allow for Lisbeth to assist Blomkvist in researching this.Unlike many mysteries where assembling the clues is the most fun, the real heart of this story is the odd, somewhat uncomfortable developing relationship between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. This latest version allows this to develop relatively smoothly, but it nonetheless rattles our senses. We see the subtle changes in Lisbeth as she slowly opens up to the idea of a real friendship based on trust. Fear not mystery fans, the Vanger clan still provides more than enough juice to keep any film sleuth happy.It's truly impossible to avoid comparisons between the two movie versions and the respective casts. It's quite obvious Mr. Fincher was working with a substantially greater budget than Niels Arden Opler had for the first Swedish film. While they are both enthralling, I actually lean a bit towards the rawer original. That takes nothing away from this latest version. Same with Noomi Rapace vs. Rooney Mara. Ms. Mara is excellent in her performance and I was fully satisfied, but Ms. Rapace brought a rougher edge to the role ... one that made it even tougher to crack that shell. The biggest difference in the casts is Daniel Craig against Michael Nyqvist. Mr. Craig is just a bit too cool for the role, while Nyqvist captured the insecurity and vulnerability that Larsson wrote about.All of that is nit-picking. Both film versions are sterling entertainment and hopefully the Fincher version will bring the story to a much wider audience. I would encourage those that are interested to check out the Swedish version, as well as the Larsson books. Maybe that will explain my fascination with this creature known as Lisbeth Salander.",7,166,248,20 December 2011
Dreamgirls," Hot Tub! Burn My Toe ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Despite this being a massive hunk of Hollywood cheese and mostly fictitious re-telling of the Motown backroom, this one is a bit of fun with a couple of outstanding vocal performances along the way.The basic story revolves around the beginning of group similar to the Supremes and the slick production of Berry Gordy's Motown and the packaging of this mainstream black girl band so that white audiences would buy in. Part of this packaging involved the promotion to front and center of the more beautiful, charismatic (and whiter) Beyonce (Deean) over the more talented Jennifer Hudson (Effe). Not too subtle in the similarities to the real Supremes, but it is fun to watch Beyonce evolve into the diva (even though the excess of Diana Ross is downplayed). Jamie Foxx doesn't really capture the charm and sleaze necessary for his role ... we never really see why these artists trust him in the first place.Eddie Murphy steals his scenes as James 'Thunder' Early (a slightly toned down James Brown) and he brings some much needed levity to the film when it gets a little too self-indulgent. Other nice supporting work by Danny Glover, Keith Robinson and the 'Boston Public' duo of Sharon Leal and Loretta Devine.Make no mistake, this is Jennifer Hudson's film. She has two blow-the-doors-off songs, especially 'And I'M Telling You I'm Not Going'. Should be nominated for best song. Ms. Hudson is an amazing singer, but has a ways to go in the acting dept. Luckily the quasi-musical approach makes it easier on her.The film probably has a couple too many musical numbers and some run a bit long. Because of this, the story suffers a bit. It is, however, definitely worth seeing for the Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce vocals.",6,1,5,1 January 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Let the Sun Shine In
","Greetings again from the darkness. Although Steve Carell has shown flashes of comedic genius in 'Anchorman' and on TV in 'The Office' and 'The Daily Show', my expectations for this one were very low, given the subject matter.Pleasantly surprised at how Carell (as writer and lead actor) and Judd Apatow (as writer and director) delicately handle the topic and the situations that Carell's character finds himself, I found myself smiling, more than laughing. Much of the movie is downright sweet and charming.Don't get me wrong. There is much raunch and uncomfortable content when the boys are in full planning mood. It is interesting that two of Carell's three buddies on a mission both appeared in 'Anchorman' with him (Paul Rudd and the very funny Seth Rogen). Scene stealers include an almost predatory Jane Lynch and an insatiable Elizabeth Banks (Spider-Man movies).The 'Aquarius' segment at the end of brilliant and a vast improvement over a similar type ending to 'There's Something About Mary'With all of the nice supporting work, there is no mistake that this movie belongs to Carell and a truly terrific Catherine Keener. Keener displays none of the harshness that has made her famous, but instead is full of grace and charm and vulnerability. We like her and find ourselves pulling for them to make it (pun intended) Is the storyline built in? Yes. Is it executed well? Yes. This is usually a pretty good foundation for a comedy. Apatow and Carell turn a one trick pony into a pretty nice film that is definitely worth seeing.",7,1,4,22 August 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Optimum Trajectory
","Greetings again from the darkness. The best I can do here is give this one credit for trying to be a little different. From the opening credits when we are told ''You wouldn't believe how much of this is true', the quasi-farcical approach works sometimes and falls flat at other time.George Clooney begins the film at his deadpan best, but the story is so convoluted, that even he doesn't know what to do with it after that. Can't even tell you why Ewan McGregor would take his role unless he owed actor-turned-director Grant Heslov a favor. Kevin Spacey sleepwalks through another performance, though Jeff Bridges does have some fun in a 1960's style montage.Mostly all I can say is I am confused how a film with so much seemingly going on, could actually be so boring. The story needed to take a real direction instead of bouncing around between is it a real secret spy program, or is it a film of self-discovery, or is it a parody, or is it a commentary? Some filmmakers can mesh different styles, but rather than meshed, this one was just messy.",5,21,41,8 November 2009
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Ilsa in Casablanca II
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's been almost 20 years since the beginning of the MI movie franchise, and in that time, Tom Cruise has aged at least 3 months. Perhaps the prank is on us and Mr Cruise actually filmed his scenes for all 5 Mission: Impossible movies in 1995. Of course that didn't happen, yet somehow each entry of the series manages to get bigger and louder and wilder, so that we may continually marvel at the fountain of youth and physical prowess of the actor seemingly born to play Ethan Hunt.Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) becomes the fifth different director to helm a film in the franchise, and he kicks things off with the stunning pre-credit action sequence you have probably already heard about  Cruise tackles an Airbus A400M (aka a huge cargo plane). It's a short, but incredibly impressive stunt sequence that sets the stage for a movie filled with action, fighting, stunts, comedy, and intrigue – all with minimal CGI.Alec Baldwin appears as the head of the CIA and the guy trying to permanently shut down the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), while Jeremy Renner does his best to prevent this from happening – without officially confirming or denying any specific action of Ethan Hunt's team. When Baldwin wins, Cruise goes rogue in an attempt to track down Soloman Lane (played by Sean Harris), the sinister leader of the terrorist group known as The Syndicate (mentioned briefly at the end of the last MI movie).As spectacular as Cruise is, the real flavor of the movie comes courtesy of Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa – a spy, double spy, or something else. Ilsa is smart and exceedingly well trained, and the perfect partner/adversary for Hunt  depending on the moment. Admittedly, this viewer knew nothing of Ms. Ferguson prior to the film, as her best known work as come on TV's 'The White Queen'. While I couldn't help but chuckle as Ilsa made her way through Casablanca, it seemed apropos since fellow Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman made cinematic history there some 73 years prior.Simon Pegg returns and as a bigger role this time alongside Cruise. Pegg plays gadget-dude Benji Dunn, and as you would expect adds a welcome dose of comical dialogue along the way. Joining Cruise as the only actors to appear in all five MI movies is Ving Rhames as Luther. He is given little to do this time, and it's pretty clear Mr. Rhames has not adhered to the same workout program as Mr Cruise over the years. Alec Baldwin seems to be parodying Alec Baldwin these days, and he has become a real on screen distraction – seriously in need of a change-of-pace role. Sean Harris uses his voice to generate an unusual coldness to his role as villain, and Simon McBurney and Tom Hollander deliver the expected steady turns.With a nod to Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, there is a wonderful sequence at the Venice Austria Opera House  in the background to Puccini's Turandot. In addition to the Opera and the opening aviation-based fun, we also have an exhilarating motorcycle chase, some new and tricky high-tech gadgetry, an unusual car chase through the hairpin turns of Morocco, the patented MI 'mask' trick, and plenty of fight scenes involving Cruise and Ferguson.If you are a fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, you will undoubtedly find this to be a welcome and fun addition. And since Cruise has already signed on for another, the most impossible mission may be in determining whether he gets any older prior to its release.",8,1,3,16 August 2015
Spider-Man," skip the high tech, how bout dunst in the rain
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Disagreeing with the masses ($114 million opening weekend), I say this was quite the disappointment.  It is a little confusing to note that there is a decided lack of action in a movie that also has way too many CGI graphics.  Goblin's costume looked like it was directly off the Haloween shelf at Toys 'R Us.  The bulk of the action was spidey swinging through the streets of the city like a kid on a jungle gym.  Sam Raimi directs this to the best of his abilities, which seem to be quite limited.  He is no master of storytelling.  Enough bagging, let's talk positive.  Kirsten Dunst may be on her way to becoming the next Julia Roberts.  She has a wonderfully likeability about her and is plenty cute - just needs a touch more maturity and she should become highly sought after by movie-makers at the next level.  The rain proved to be quite complimentary to Miss Dunst during one particular scene.  Overall, very mediocre and I hope lessons are learned for the filming of spider-man 2.",7,0,1,6 May 2002
Jarhead," They Said Field Fun!
","Greetings again from the darkness. The kiss of death for a movie is walking into the theater expecting to see a great film. Director Sam Mendes is putting together a good resume with the solid 'The Road to Perdition' and the great 'American Beauty'. What he has is an eye for is the shot. What he is missing is the gift of storytelling.Based around Desert Shield/Storm, 'Jarhead' focuses on Marine Swofford played to the fullest by Jake Gyllenhaal. The frustration, isolation and periodic bouts of lost sanity are explored as soldiers are trained and then shipped off to sit around in the blazing desert. 'When do we get to kill somebody?' is a recurring theme and is one of many political left wing propaganda statements attempted by the film (others include faulty equipment, protection drugs, staged interviews, etc). Sadly, the film is neither a true anti-war picture or a real psycho-probe of soldiers. It toys with both and fails with both.Peter Sarsgaard is the most effective of the actors although his relationship with Gyllenhaal is a pinball that is impossible to follow. Are they friends or rivals? I would like to know when and how they supposedly got so close.The true magic in this film is at the hand of the marvelous cinematographer, Roger Deakins ('A Beautiful Mind', 'Shawshank Redemption' and most every Cohen Brothers film). The visuals in the battlefields and desert as well as the claustrophobia of cramped quarters and protective suits are the only reasons the film works at all. We can feel the heat from the burning oil wells and smell the nastiness of latrine duty as well as the sliminess of crude oil rain on the face. Masterful.Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert are all effective in their roles, but overall the film just is missing a soul. Very disappointing that there is no clear direction or story or plot so the film never reaches the great level it obviously aspires to.",6,3,6,8 November 2005
Collateral," I Keep on Dancin'
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Michael Mann became famous for his work on 'Miami Vice' in the 80's and has had his ups ('The Insider' 'Manhunter' 'Thief') and downs ('Heat' 'Ali') as a feature film director. 'Colateral' is a mixed bag of both.  Casting usually good guy Tom Cruise as the souless hit man is what provides the initial interest in this film and Cruise does a fine job in this new territory.  Couldn't help but mentally write the script with this Vince as a grown-up Vince from 'The Color of Money'.  Of course, the playfulness has been replaced by ice water in the veins.  As with many movies these days, the script comes up short and prevents this from being what it hinted at being.  The best scene is the taxi cab banter between Jamie Foxx and Mrs. Will Smith.  You sense that they could really help each other learn to live life.  Foxx does an admirable job as the whipped, day-dreaming, somewhat scared of life part-time for 12 years cab driver.  He has the gift of gab for the fares and really risks nothing in his everyday life.  Everything changes one night when he accepts Cruise as a passenger and accidently discovers (with a bang) the mission this real estate professional is really on.  The most absurd scene is the nightclub scene where guns are blaring, fights are everywhere and the dancers keep dancing.  What kind of capture and rescue plan was this anyway?  Was it possible to put any more civilians at risk?  Anyway, the screenplay is way too loose and is just plain awful towards the end.  Despite the flaws, it is a very watchable film and interesting because of the Cruise character.",7,0,4,11 August 2004
Dunkirk," Masterpiece triptych
","Greetings again from the darkness. Even for us frequent movie-goers, a truly great film is a rare and emotional experience. Leave it to Christopher Nolan, one of the finest film makers working today, to deliver a World War II masterpiece centered on a remarkable and historic evacuation, rather than one of the epic battles that more directly led to an Allied victory. The result is a spectacular, stunning and relentlessly intense assault on our eyes, ears and emotions  it's a horrific thing of artistic beauty.Mr. Nolan chooses a triptych approach to tell the May/June 1940 Dunkirk story from three distinctly different perspectives: The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. The Mole (term for protective sea walls) is the 'by land' segment, and it shows nearly 400,000 soldiers lined up on the beach – nervously waiting to be either rescued or massacred. The Sea puts us not on the deck of the Navy destroyers, but rather alongside the citizen volunteers who answered the call to ferry men off the beach with own pleasure vessels. The Air plops us inside the Spitfire cockpits of two Royal Air Force pilots battling low fuel as they attempt to protect their fellow soldiers below. This 3-part film harmony expertly captures the disorientation of war by shuffling between the three segments, and varying the timelines and sequence of each.This all happened pretty early in the war, as Winston Churchill had only become Prime Minister a few weeks prior. It should be noted that Mr. Nolan purposefully avoids the usual war room blustery (we see neither Churchill nor Hitler, and there is no mention of the infamous Halt Order) and allows the action to tell the story. Instead, his focus on the (very) young men being sent to battle makes a clear political statement on the absurdity of war. One of 'The Sea' volunteers (an excellent Mark Rylance) delivers the message when he states it's the old men running the war, so he can't be expected to just sit back as young sons are sent to fight and die.Despite the epic look, feel and sound of the film and the massive scale of the event, this film is surprisingly at its best in the small moments of heroism and the dogged determination of individuals to survive. Minimal dialogue allows the horrors of war to take center screen. Danger and death are at every turn – bombings, torpedoes, drowning, gunfire, and most any imaginable peril is ever-present. We witness PTSD (shell-shock) in the form of Cillian Murphy's shivering rescued soldier, and are reminded that every young man present will be either dead or scarred for life. No one escapes war unscathed.The opening sequence finds young Fionn Whitehead and his squad being targeted with gunfire as German leaflets fall from the sky. The leaflets are maps outlining the hopelessness as German forces have them surrounded. The film is meticulously researched and historically based, though the few characters we get to know are fictionalized accounts. The practical effects throughout are breath-taking and much of it was filmed on location at the Dunkirk beach. There will likely be some complaints regarding the scarcity of female characters and those of color, but the technical aspects of the film are beyond reproach – although the French might have preferred their military receive a bit more attention. Hans Zimmer's score is unique and searing as it perfectly captures the intensity of the film. His use of a ticking watch only perpetuates the constant feeling of running out of time. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and Editor Lee Smith prove why they are among the best at their profession.Given the spectacle of the action (if possible, see it in IMAX or 70mm), it's remarkable how we still manage to get to know some of the characters. From The Mole segment, Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard and Harry Styles represent the young soldiers, while Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy play officers. Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden are piloting the Spitfires, while Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan, Tom Glynn-Carney, and Cillian Murphy are aboard the rescue yacht. Nolan regular and good luck charm Michael Caine can be recognized as the voice on Air Force radio. There is a 1958 film with the same title, and it stars John Mills and Richard Attenborough. The connection (other than the Dunkirk title) is Sir Attenborough's grandson Will appears in this current film.The horrors and impact of World War II continue to be an abundant garden – ripe for the picking when it comes to movies. Over the past 70 years there have been numerous approaches to telling part of the story that redefined the world: Judgment at Nuremberg (legal aftermath), Casablanca (romance), I Was a Male War Bride (comedy), Tora! Tora! Tora! and From Here to Eternity (Pearl Harbor), Shoah (documentary), Schindler's List and Son of Saul (holocaust), Downfall (Hitler), The Great Escape (entertainment), Patton (bio), The Pianist (personal), Saving Private Ryan (Normandy), Das Boot (U-boat), The Thin Red Line (Guadalcanal), and Letter From Iwo Jima (two opposing perspectives). Each of these, and many others, have their place in War movie history, and now Christopher Nolan's film belongs among the best.",9,6,18,19 July 2017
The Intouchables," Let's Dance
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes acting elevates material to a level far beyond what a film might have otherwise deserved. Such is the case with this based-on-a-true-story effort from co-writers and co-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Despite the elements of truth, the core material here is a sentimental tale that we have seen before. Francois Cluzet (Tell No One) as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss turn it into an extremely entertaining story with characters we quickly connect with.Philippe is a wealthy quadriplegic widower who is interviewing candidates for a caregiver. Driss is a recently released from jail street hustler who is just trying to qualify for state benefits by going on the required interviews. Philippe is struck by Driss' direct approach and energy level, and chooses Driss over the room full of more qualified types.The rest of the movie is really a buddy flick where the polar opposites bring much to the other. Philippe slyly gets Driss to use his sharp mind a bit more effectively, and Driss taps into Philippe's hidden lust for life. Though the supporting cast is fine, the film's best scenes are those featuring Philippe and Driss.This is a film from France and much as been made of the filmmakers' decision to change the caregiver from the real life Arab to a more cinema-friendly Black man. The Earth, Wind & Fire dance may be a bit too much, but I choose to believe the casting of Omar Sy was the deciding factor, not his race. He lights up the screen and draws us right into his world and his choices - some of which are better than others.The film shares much with The Sea Inside, Scent of a Woman, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, but this one has much more humor and bonding than any of those. It doesn't shy away from the melodramatic moments and isn't above trying to generate tears in viewers. There will be a US re-make of this one, but the two lead actors here (especially Mr. Sy) make this one worth seeing.",8,4,7,4 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," One Guy in a Unitard
","Greetings again from the darkness. The big debate seems to be whether it is too soon for the Spider-Man franchise to be re-booted. It was just 10 years ago when Tobey Maguire first appeared as Spidey and a mere 5 years ago when director Sam Raimi delivered the last leg in his trilogy. Obviously the reason to re-boot starts with 'doll' and ends with 'ars'. It is more interesting to decide if this is an improvement over the previous series.We must first look at Spider-man himself. Played here by Andrew Garfield, we get a more thoughtful Peter Parker and a more athletic Spidey version than we had with Maguire. As usual, my pet peeve is that Garfield is a 28 year old man cast as an 18 year old high school science nerd. Looking past that, Garfield manages to pull off the stunts without looking too much like a real super hero. So that's a plus. Luckily for him, his scenes with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) work because Ms. Stone is such a super talent. She makes everything she is in, just a little bit better.Next we look at the villain. Rhys Ifans plays scientist Dr Curt Connors, who transforms into Lizard in the quest to regenerate growth of his lost right arm. He was once partners with Peter's dad in their research into reptilian genetics. While Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite villain in the series, it's clear that Lizard is certainly capable of frightening the younger viewers, so parents beware. It should also be noted that Dr Curt Connors was played by Dylan Baker in the Sam Raimi trilogy.Lastly, we look at the story. This take is much more personal and provides detail to the backstory of Peter Parker. We learn how (but not exactly why) he lost his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) and see how he came to be raised by Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). We see how he and Gwen Stacy come together and learn that she is every bit his equal intellectually, if not a notch above. Casting Dennis Leary as Gwen's Police Chief dad works as Leary and Garfield exchange barbs at the table. Peter is still a photographer, but this time for the school instead of The Daily Bugle ... whose logo makes an appearance on TV.Director Marc Webb was somehow selected for this despite his only feature film being (500) Days of Summer ... not exactly a film known for its CGI. Admittedly, the CGI used here is less rush and cluttered than in previous Spidey films and many of the stunts look to be real stunts instead of the fake stuff. The closing credit cookie clearly sets up the sequel, though I can only guess that the shadowy figure is Norman Osborn. That's still up for debate.",7,6,12,7 July 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," I like Your Style
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not unusual for an actor or actress to alter their physical appearance for a movie role. Sometimes those changes become the story: Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Christian Bale in The Machinist are two that come to mind. Regardless of the transformation or make-up, what really matters is the performance and the character. Just ask Eddie Murphy (Norbit) or Gwyneth Paltrow (Shallow Hal). In The Dallas Buyers Club, we actually get two incredible transformations that lead to two stunning performances.Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto each lost approximately 40 pounds for their respective roles as Ron Woodroof, the redneck, three-way loving, alcoholic, drug-addicted electrician/rodeo cowboy; and Rayon, the sensitive, street-savvy, would-be transsexual so desperate for a kind word. Their physical appearance will startle you more than once, but is quite effective in getting across the struggles of those infected with HIV virus in the 1980's. The numbers impacted exploded and the medical profession was ill-equipped to properly treat the patients.This is based on a true story and a real life guy (Woodroof) who became a most unlikely beacon of hope for AIDS patients. Woodroof fought the medical industry, Pharmaceutical companies and the government (FDA, DEA, IRS). It's impossible to miss the message and accusations that most of these had a single goal of increasing profits, rather than curing the disease. And that's where the story lags a bit. Michael O'Neill and Dennis O'Hare are the faces of greed and bureaucracy, while Jennifer Garner, Leto, and Griffin Dunne represent the side with a heart. Woodroof seems to be a guy who just doesn't want to die, sees a business opportunity, and even learns a little bit about humanity along the way.There have been numerous other projects that deal with AIDS, including: Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and the recent documentary How to Survive a Plague. This may be the first with a protagonist who is simply unlikeable, despite his passion and strong survival instincts. McConaughey doesn't shy away from the homophobic personality and cruel manner of speech that Woodroof possesses. We never doubt his frustration at those controlling the big picture, but we never really see him connect with those his brash tactics help.McConaughey is on a dream run as an actor right now, and it certainly wouldn't be surprising to see him garner an Oscar nomination. But it would be a mistake to chalk that up to his losing so much weight - he really delivers a character that we won't soon forget. And let's not overlook Mr. Leto, who has been away from acting for 4 years touring with his band. He is a remarkable talent and a true screen presence. Compare this role to his Mark David Chapman in Chapter 27. It's not just the range of weight, but moreso the range in acting that so impresses.Also worth noting here is the outstanding cinematography of Yves Belanger. This movie is shot in a way that brings out the intimacy of the moments, while not losing the big picture. Director Jean-Marc Vallee (The Young Victoria) and co-writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack work together for a solid foundation, but it's McConaughey and Leto that we will most remember ... and of course, the pics of the great Marc Bolan on the wall. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com",7,178,210,11 November 2013
The Exorcist," Be Gone ... to the theatre
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Back in the theatre 27 years after the initial release, and everyone with any interest should spend the $7.00 and check this out the way it was meant to be seen.  This was William Friedkin's third consecutive, and last, great film (after 'Boys in the Band' and 'French Connection'.  Anyone under 35 years old can't understand the controversy and impact of this film on its original release. The giggles and laughter in the theatres are typically from those movie-goers who historically jump and scream everytime some clown in a hockey mask reappears to hack someone to death. If this is not your first time, pay special attention to Jack Nitzche's musical score.  Nitzche, who died this year, composed music for some wonderful films including 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'An Officer and a Gentleman', 'Stand By Me', 'Starman', and 'The Hot Spot' (one of personal favs).He had an uncanny ability to capture the essence of the film in his music.  Also admire Jason Miller's marvelously understated performance as Father Karras.  He is now known as Coach Ara Parseghian in 'Rudy'. It is also fun to watch for some 'set bloopers' (items misplaced or moved between scenes).  A couple of tidbits from this one: the writer, William Peter Blatty also co-wrote 'A Shot in the Dark', the first Inspector Clouseau flick; and the composer, Jack Nitzche also co-wrote the 60's hit 'Needles and Pins'.",8,2,4,23 October 2000
Now You See Me," The Closer You Look ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Come on ... who wouldn't get excited about a movie that mixes magic with the heist genre, and fills the cast with stars old and new? Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) is clearly engaged with the material, and maybe his vision of 'just one more twist' is what keeps it from reaching the next level.Magic is inherently a very difficult subject for movies. Why? Because with magic, human nature is such that we are always trying to 'catch' the sleight of hand. With movies, we have come to accept the fact that any special effect is possible. We rarely ask 'how'. That kind of takes away the mystery, eh? Maybe the best magic movie to date is The Prestige, but even that movie was made stronger by the story of its characters ... something this latest lacks.Heist movies, on the other hand, have historically produced some of the most fun and thrilling times on screen. Everyone loves a clever caper ... so long as we aren't on the wrong end. What doesn't work in either genre, and especially when they are blended, is a story that defies logic. We don't mind being tricked. In fact, it's kind of fun getting to the end and realizing you are part of the 'gotcha'. What we don't like is being cheated.The premise is terrific. An unknown benefactor secretly assembles The Four Horsemen - a hand-picked (by a hoodie dude) group consisting of Jessie Eisenberg, the smug super-illusionist; Woody Harrelson, the wise-cracking mentalist; tart escape artist (think Houdini with piranha) Isla Fisher; and street-hustler pickpocket (Artful Dodger type) Dave Franco. The group is bank rolled by industrial tycoon Michael Caine, and is soon enough headlining a giant Las Vegas extravaganza. Their trick is to rob a French bank vault by transporting an audience member, video streaming the job, and showering the audience with the stolen cash. They do this under the watchful eye of magic naysayer Morgan Freeman, a huckster who earns a buck exposing the tricks of magicians.Soon enough, an FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) are working together trying to stop the next job, which Morgan Freeman has warned them is really a set-up for a huge finale. The movie has some really fun moments, but with all of Morgan Freeman's warnings that we (and Ruffalo) are always a step behind, we can't help but think ahead ... and there is only one super twist that makes all of this click.In fact, I would argue that there are too many twists here. The basic story was enough and would have benefited from us getting to know the main characters. Instead, they are merely chess pieces who spout one-liners in order. In particular, the characters of Woody Harrelson and Melanie Laurent could have gone much deeper. But that clashes with what the filmmakers were after ... big, fast, wild, glitzy, cute, clever, and twisty. So don't be tricked into thinking. Turn off your brain and take in the wild, twisty ride ... even if it does defy logic, and we know 'it's all part of the show'.",5,4,10,2 June 2013
Saw III," Pork, the other white meat
","Greetings again from the darkness. Third in the Saw series developed by James Wan, this one is significantly better than the second, but falls short of the first, due mostly to the lack of freshness. Three is (as Two was)directed by Darren Lynn Bousman who benefits from a much more complex script and less complicated gadgets and contraptions.This story centers around Jigsaw (the eerily great Tobin Bell) playing one of his infamous games with a brilliant, yet detached doctor (played well by Bahan Soomekh) who is charged with keeping Jigsaw alive during his last test(s) on his protégé Amanda (played horribly in her third turn by Shawnee Smith). The twists are minimal in this story, but as opposed to Saw II, the twists and turns make sense.Be prepared for even more gore than the first two, but again we have no character that we really care about or pull for. Amanda may be one of the least sympathetic film characters ever. The flashback scenes are not very effective ... the exception being Donnie Wahlberg and his poor foot. As always, the best scenes include Tobin Bell and his lessons of life for the misguided souls who end up on the wrong end of his 'fair' tests.",5,1,3,21 November 2006
Pearl Harbor," How 'bout a movie with that close-up?
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I have anxiously awaited 'Pearl Harbor' due to lack of interesting films released over the past couple of months. After the first 45 minutes, I was ready to walk out.  A relentless string of close-ups on our 3 beautiful young stars made me dizzy.  However, once the real action began, this became a film to appreciate.  Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) again proves a master at huge special effects.  I felt sadness and sickness during the attack, as well as pride in the actions of the soldiers.  I bought Jon Voigt as FDR and thought Alec Baldwin was fine as the hardass flight instructor.  Veteran actor Mako had the necessary screen presence to pull off the portrayal of Admiral Yamamota, and I thought Dan Aykroyd provided nice work in his limited role.  My tidbit on this one is to check out Toru Tanaka, Jr (son of the 60's and 70's professional wrestler)as the bouncer in the bar.  Overall, breathtaking war scenes and 3rd rate love scenes.",6,0,2,29 May 2001
Jackie," behind Camelot
","Greetings again from the darkness. There will be two distinct groups that erroneously presume this is a traditional biopic of the glamorous former first lady: those who wave it off as Lifetime Channel fare, and those who excitedly walk in thinking they are going to be swept away in the pink Chanel suit from that fateful day in November 1963. Instead, the first English language feature from director Pablo Larrain (No, 2012) offers up a what-might-have-been look behind the scenes and takes a stab at the psychological make-up of the often underestimated and complex woman known even today as simply Jackie.The opening scene provides the first of countless close-ups of Natalie Portman as Jackie. Different than the usual movie close-ups, these are somehow closer – more intimate and more intrusive. The shots make us uncomfortable, as if we are intruding on her personal space. This is by design, as the film takes us to a surreal place where we see Jackie the person, rather than Jackie the icon. The framing device used is an interview she granted to Life Magazine reporter Thomas H White (Billy Crudup billed only as 'the journalist') at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, merely a week after the assassination.To grasp the concept here from director Larrain and writer Noah Oppenheim (in a big stretch from The Maze Runner), it's imperative to understand that, at the time, Jackie was the personification of a nation's grief and the ultimate example of dignity and grace (yes, Seinfeld fans, she had grace). We quickly witness the power and control she wielded. 'Don't think for a second I'm going to allow you to publish that'  she states after exposing her most vulnerable and personal thoughts. Later, she puffs on a cigarette and tells the reporter, 'I don't smoke'. It's in these moments that we begin to realize the point – Jackie was a master at generating the 'proper' public perception from even the harshest personal realities (many of which the film politely ignores).Much of the film deals with her dogged pursuit of creating a lasting legacy for her husband. The idea of Camelot was meant to provide hope and idealism to the public who so wanted to idolize and romanticize the first couple. The symmetry with Lincoln – the portrait, the bedroom and the meticulously planned elaborate funeral procession – were meant to establish heft and substance for an all-too-brief administration that even had brother Robert (Peter Sarsgaard) lamenting how little was accomplished. These were the calculated strategies of a woman who was much more than the charming and slightly nervous host who took America on a televised tour of The White House on CBS in 1962.The film utilizes flashbacks to the Lincoln Continental with the Texas Schoolbook Depository in the background, as well as detailed recreations of The White House, Parkland Hospital, Air Force One, St. Matthew's Cathedral, and of course, the pink Chanel dress. That said, this is certainly not a movie designed to solve the case or disprove one of the conspiracy theories  it remains steadfast as a close-up of Jackie.Others in supporting roles include a nearly unrecognizable (and minus her usual ticks) Greta Gerwig as Nancy Tuckerman (Jackie's social secretary and friend), John Carroll Lynch and Beth Grant as LBJ and Lady Bird, Max Casella as Jack Valenti, stunning lookalike Caspar Phillipson as JFK, and a remarkable John Hurt as the Priest helping Jackie through her spiritual crisis. But of course this is Natalie Portman's movie. She captures the breathy vocals and the contrasting strong directness when dealing with Bobby and Lyndon. Her movements mirror those from the actual footage of the White House tour  it's really a performance to behold.Many original images, videos, and clips are blended/spliced into the re-enactments to add a touch of sentimentality and prove how close to reality the film holds. One thing to brace for is the most unique score you'll likely hear in a film this year. Mica Levi's unusual sound brilliantly complements the many moods of Jackie, and even manages to remain strong around Richard Burton's blasting of 'Camelot'. Ms. Portman's performance and the behind-the-curtain approach work well in reminding us that these were real people  not just Kennedys.",8,3,10,10 December 2016
No Strings Attached," Text Me if You Need Some
","Greetings again from the darkness. If you have read even a few of my reviews, you know I am not typically a fan of the Hollywood Rom-Com. I find most of them lazy, lame, predictable and irritating. But when legendary comedy director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Dave, Stripes) gets involved, I will at least pay attention. Here Mr. Reitman directs a script that on the surface will examine the Friends with Benefits phenomenon.The leads are played by Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman, and the twist here is that Portman's Emma is the driving force behind the agreement with Kutcher's Adam to not have a relationship ... only relations. Even Adam's friends point out to him that he is living every male's fantasy. So does anyone think this will really work? Of course not.First, they are both just so darn cute! And Adam is oh-so-adorable as the sly one hoping to break through and convince Emma that he is worthy of her love. All the physical stuff continues as Adam works his job on the set of a Glee knock-off, battles with his dad (Kevin Kline) who is sleeping with Adam's ex-girlfriend (a wonderful Opehlia Lovibond), and Emma slaves away saving lives in her job as a brilliant doctor. Oh, and one of Adam's co-workers (a manic Lake Bell) has a mega crush on him, and Emma's little sister (Olivia Thirlby) finds true love as does Emma's friend Patrice (Greta Gerwig from Greenberg), who falls for Adam's best friend. Wow. All that love and our two heroes just have to keep things between the sheets.On the plus side, the side stories are enough fun that the film is easily watchable despite the predictable nature of the premise. Even the Portman/Kutcher story is tolerable thanks to the gender-bending nature of their roles. I would have preferred to see the Friends with Benefits pact extended and examined (it worked in the Stieg Larsson books!). This is easily Mr. Reitman's best comedy since 1993's 'Dave', which also featured Kevin Kline. It's nice to see Ms. Portman do something lightweight after her fabulous 'Black Swan' performance, but I am really hoping Mr. Kutcher understands that someday he may really have to act and not just smile on cue.",6,2,7,23 January 2011
Tropic Thunder," You People ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Viewed as a spoof on Big Hollywood, this is pretty darn funny! Of course, we live in the time of political correctness when Eddie Murphy and Tyler Perry and Wayan brothers can make fun of people all day, but let Ben Stiller try, and we are subjected to outrage and protests from multiple self-interest groups. By age seven, most of us can tell the difference between a funny movie or comedian and the President or a Senator saying or doing something tasteless. If you can remember that this is only a movie ... you will probably laugh out loud a few times! Writer/Director/Actor Ben Stiller delivers his best work to date. The screenplay was co-written with the amazingly underrated Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. Starring as actors in a movie that ends up being a movie about a movie that almost got made, we have Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Brandon T Jackson (as Alpa Chino ... say it fast) and Jay Baruchel. These guys are all terrific and funny and are joined in support by Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan and Matthew McConaughey.As good as the overall comedic performances are, I must point out the two standouts. Robert Downey Jr is truly amazing as the high profile actor who undergoes a medical procedure to turn himself from an Australian into an African-American. Always a talented actor, Downey reaches an entirely new level with this flawless performance ... effortlessly bounding between a take-off on Russell Crowe to his tribute to Jim Brown. Just great stuff and worth the price of admission. Also a surprising treat is offered up by Tom Cruise, who leaves nothing in his bag of tricks playing an eccentric, plump, foul-mouthed, soulless, big shot studio executive. He does everything from scream obscenities to lay down some very uncomfortable dance steps! A real hoot!!! Sure, the story is a bit lame, but as in many outrageous comedies, the story is merely a backdrop for the jokes ... and there are MANY here. It will probably require a second viewing to pick up all the punchlines and visual effects, but don't miss the early 'trailers', especially featuring Christine Taylor (Stiller's real life wife) and one of the most memorable ads that you'll wish you could forget ... complete with jingle by Brandon T Jackson.",7,2,5,16 August 2008
Enchanted," Forever and Ever
","Greetings again from the darkness. A Disney fairy tale like the old classics ... only this time brought to life! Beautiful princess to be, charming, handsome (though somewhat daft) Prince, evil witch/step-mother, bumbling henchman, lovable little creatures, all wrapped up in a fantastical love story.Amy Adams (so wonderful in 'Junebug') is magic on screen as the pure-hearted fairy tale princess-to-be who comes to life ... oddly enough in Times Square! Ms. Adams has the bright-eyed, innocence to capture the wonderment and excitement of the damsel in distress who just wants someone to be nice to her. I would love to see the Academy recognize her performance because it is worthy. Her movements and hand gestures and sparkling eyes and upbeat voice are just perfect for the role. Of course, a nomination couldn't possibly happen because this is a sweet film aimed at kids.FINALLY ... Susan Sarandon is perfectly cast! She is not believable as a loyal wife or loving mother or love interest or fact finding reporter. As an evil witch/step-mother she has found her niche. I absolutely love her scenes as she first arrives in real life. James Marsden ('Hairspray') is also very good as the slightly goofy, but well-meaning Prince come to save the poor damsel. Patrick Dempsey is along for the ride as the single dad who befriends (and maybe more!) the lost princess. Watching his face during the Central Park musical scene is pretty funny.This is one that kids and parents and grandparents of all ages can enjoy. Certainly it is corny, but it is also good natured and warm-hearted ... two things we could all use a little more of.",7,0,3,2 December 2007
Inside Out," Yet another Pixar masterpiece
","Greetings again from the darkness. Once upon a time  in 1995 to be exact  Pixar revitalized and revolutionized the world of animated movies with the release of the first Toy Story. In the process, they sent our expectations soaring for each of their subsequent movies. Despite the pressure of such high standards, the creative geniuses at the studio have regularly thrilled and delighted us over the years with classics such as Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), Wall-E (2008), and Brave (2012). And beyond these, there have been a few true cinematic masterpieces – transcendent films: Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Up (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010). This most recent release unquestionably belongs in the latter group  it's one for the ages (and all ages).Genius and brilliance could be used to describe all aspects of this movie. It's a technical marvel, a visual kaleidoscope of bright colors across the full screen, and most amazingly, it packs an emotional wallop with real life moments for adolescents and parents alike.My comments will be brief because this is one you should experience for yourself – and probably more than once. Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is an 11 year old girl who lives in Minnesota and loves her parents, her friends, and hockey. She is happy and well-adjusted. When the family relocates to San Francisco, broccoli on the pizza is only one of the challenges Riley must face. This change affects everything for her – no more friends, no more hockey, and a strained relationship with her parents. At this point, you are probably saying 'So what? That's nothing we haven't seen before.' And you are correct, except we have never seen it explained the way Pixar does.We literally go behind-the-scenes of Riley's brain and see the control panel of her emotions. There is a constant battle between Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black), and the ring-leader Joy (Amy Poehler). This is an exploration of emotions and memories, and the explanation has some scientific merit. Memories are depicted as marbles, and Riley's favorite things are shown as islands (Sports Island, Friendship Island, etc). How emotions affect memories is the key point here, and especially how sadness is necessary and vital to our joy. Have you wondered why we forget our imaginary childhood friends (Riley's is Bing Bong, voiced by Richard Kind)? Have you wondered why our memories change over time, and are impacted by our emotional state in any given moment? This animated gem will help you understand.Director Pete Docter (the genius behind Up) has a daughter of his own, and he clearly 'gets' the emotional changes brought on during the pre-teen years. His research, and that of co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen, takes us on an adventure that should inspire much conversation between parents and kids. And even if it somehow doesn't break the ice in every family, it will at a minimum help youngsters and parents better understand the link between emotions and memories  plus, they will probably share a good cry and a bunch of laughs along the way. Hats off (again) to the Pixar geniuses. I dare you to top this one!***NOTE: you should also look forward to another Pixar tradition – the pre-movie short film. This one is a very unique short entitled Lava.",9,13,39,18 June 2015
The Duchess," Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz
","Greetings again from the darkness. The film fascination with Royalty continues thanks to the coolness of costumes and the grand scale of palaces. Of course, a thread-thin relation to Princess Diana doesn't hurt at all either.Somehow the man's world of the Duke of Devonshire, played by Ralph Fiennes, allowed for multiple affairs even to the extreme of having one's favorite side dish just move right on in to the main house ... including meals with the Royal couple!! It would be quite funny, if not so sad.Keira Knightley plays the Duchess with fortitude and the proper amount of reservation. She has become quite adept at the period piece. Fiennes, on the other hand, plays the Duke as if he has a constant stomach ache and is in need of Alka-Seltzer. He totally lacks charisma or even many human traits, save lust for those other than his wife. The third wheel who is promoted to second is played well by Hayley Atwell, a desperate and alternatingly cold and warm mother and friend. Rounding out the cast are Dominic Cooper (Mamma Mia) who plays future Prime Minister Charles Grey, and the true love of The Duchess' life; and Charlotte Rampling as the too proud mother to Knightley, who dispenses very weak advice with a stiff upper lip.The film is well done and the similarities to Princess Diana's marriage are inescapable, but there is just not quite enough substance here. Easy enough to watch, but lacking in historical details ... more of a soap opera approach.",6,9,16,12 October 2008
Yesterday," Imagine
","2019 Oak Cliff Film Festival
Greetings again from the darkness. A world without music from The Beatles? It's hard to 'imagine'. It's not as simple as never having their classics played on the radio, as the number of musicians influenced by their work is roughly the size of the list of every musician who has ever written or sang a song over the past 60 years. Of course, that's a bit too much to tackle in a movie, so director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for SLUMBDOG MILLIONAIRE) simplifies things by serving up a 12 second global power outage.Jack Malik (Himesh Patel, 'EastEnders') is the epitome of a struggling musician. He plays kids' parties and pubs where the only applause is from his small group of friends who enjoy busting his chops over his 'summer' song. His lifelong friend Ellie (Lily James, BABY DRIVER, MAMMA MIA!, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES) is also his manager and roadie ... his only true supporter. There is an unrequited attraction between the two, and since the script comes from Richard Curtis (LOVE ACTUALLY), we know where this is headed.When the global power outage hits, Jack is on his bicycle and a collision with a bus puts him in the hospital. During recovery, he stumbles on to the fact that he is the only person who remembers music from John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Quickly capitalizing on the opportunity, Jack frantically tries to recall the lyrics to the songs, and in short time is replacing his playlist post-it notes with the familiar (to us) song titles, and blowing people away with 'his' formidable songwriting and incredible music.Fortune shines on Jack and his new songs, and soon Ed Sheeran (playing himself) is helping Jack's career, while at the same time being humbled by these songs. It's at this point where Kate McKinnon joins in as the money-grubbing talent agent who recognizes a gold mine when she hears it. Additional comedy is provided by Joel Fry as Rocky, Jack's new roadie; and a trip to Liverpool follows, as does a world tour and album recording session.Danny Boyle is known best for his likeable, easy to digest films that are typically crowd-pleasers, but leave me wanting more depth and substance. This one fits right in. It's funny ('Hey Dude', Abbey Road is just a road) and has amazing music (of course). However, where Lily James plays her role perfectly, Himesh Patel - despite a fine singing voice - simply lacks the charisma and screen presence to carry the film. We rarely feel his inner turmoil in living this whopper of a lie, and the film never really clicks as a Rom-Com. In fact, the only thing we should be loving here is the Beatles music. The film plays a bit like Rod Serling decided to take 'The Twilight Zone' into comedy. The real impact would be lost, but it would still likely draw a crowd.",6,50,110,10 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," when over the top is just right
","Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled 'Avengers: Infinity War Part 2', we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos?
What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play?
Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life?
Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space?
Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic 'Dear Mr. Fantasy' and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's 'we hear you' statement. Much of what we see is 'inevitable', but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'.",8,7,20,24 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," The Garden Spot of Bolivia
","Greetings again from the darkness. After 'Casino Royale', the re-birth of the Bond franchise, I have been extremely anxious for the first Bond sequel. Now after seeing it, I can only hope that the next installment will bring an entirely new approach than what director Marc Forster has delivered. This is little more than an all-out action movie with some moments of meandering tossed in. Of course, the wrapping is pure Bond ... car chase, fights, babes, tuxedos, multiple locations, etc. But the let down is immense.On the bright side, Daniel Craig proves again that his casting was terrific. Next time, he just needs more to work with. I believe Judi Dench as M has more lines of dialogue than D Craig. In a normal film, that would not be unusual ... she is a terrific actress. But this is James Bond - where are the quips and double entendres? Mathieu Amalric was truly amazing in 'The Diving Bell and Butterfly'. Here he proves to be among the weakest of all Bond villains. What a waste. What happened to world domination? Now the prize is the water supply in Bolivia? Why Bolivia? Didn't they learn anything from Butch and Sundance? Olga Kurylenko (a famous model) and Gemma Atherton are our Bond girls. The stunning Kurylenko is so miscast that I laughed on more than a couple of occasions. At least Ms. Atherton has a real Bond girl name ... Strawberry Fields (though we only hear her referred to as 'Fields').Supporting cast is strong with return performances by Jeffrey Wright, Giancarlo Giannini and Jesper Christensen (Mr White). Also of note is Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter Oona Chaplin, who has a brief role as a receptionist. There is also a nice tribute to 'Goldfinger' with a shot of Fields on the bed.Director Forster is building a remarkable resume with the likes of 'Monster's Ball', 'Finding Neverland', 'Stranger Than Fiction' and 'Kite Runner'. What he doesn't have is a feel for action. The close-ups and rapid fire editing are just atrocious. See the Bourne movies or the two most recent Batman films for much better action. And where is the stunning SCENERY? Parts of 'Casino Royale' were right out of a travel guide. This film is bleak in each of the many locations.Two last things: is there a POINT to the opening car chase scene?; and why (in movies) do so few people every actually get shot with automatic weaponry, but Clint Eastwood can put out a cigarette from 50 yds with a 357 magnum? The film grades out low as an action film and even lower as a Bond film. The class of Craig and Dench prevent it from being a major flop but here's hoping the next installment is turned over to someone with an appreciation of what the Bond series has meant.",6,1,3,15 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Not your father's nose bleed
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Admittedly, psychological thrillers are my favorite film genre.  First time co-directors (and co-writers from 'Final Destination 2') Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber deliver some effective suspense and a few thrills and chills ... especially in the first 20 minutes.  The film does lose a bit of momentum in the second half and there were some missed opportunities for more twists and turns, but overall 'The Butterfly Effect' will keep your attention and make you squirm a time or two.  Today's Mr. Overexposed, Ashton Kutcher ('Dude, Where's My Car') flashes some dramatic promise, especially when called upon for the deer in the headlights look.  He effectively sneers his way through the college boy moments, but doesn't really pull off the prison time.  Amy Smart (from the underappreciated mini-classic 'Outside Providence') is remarkable in her many roles within a role. Hopefully this will boost her career and she will continue to be pushed artistically.  Melora Walters (fresh from her spot-on performance in the over-hyped 'Cold Mountain') delivers as Ashton's frightened Mom who just can't make the right move to save her boy.  The story takes time travel to an entirely new dimension - it's definitely NOT 'Back to the Future'.  It does have a touch of 'Seven', which not coincidently, plays a role in the film.  The child actors are all very well cast, but I would have liked to see a bit more of the story line on Ashton's dad.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Far and away my most anticipated film of the year, 'No Country ...' does not disappoint. So many are complaining about the ending. Personally, I couldn't care less. The journey made this one fulfilling and extraordinarily satisfying. It is remarkable film making from the Coen Brothers, who stay faithful to the source material while injecting their own style and fiendish touches.In the mode of 'Blood Simple' this film moves along at a torcherous pace and offers up some of the most gut-wrenching, tense scenes ever filmed. The visual aspects of the desolate Texas countryside (actually New Mexico) compliments the isolation of each of the three main characters: Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Additionally, one must enjoy the amazing sound production here from the smallest of details (coin flip) to the surround sound overload of Bardem's air gun.The acting is among the best we will ever see on film. Tommy Lee Jones' hang dog face is so perfect as the dry and sly witted sheriff. Even the way he seems defeated by good news is purely a pro in action. Javier Bardem is not as well known to American film audiences, but to understand his greatness, check out 'The Sea Inside'. His Beatles haircut and stoic evilness are chilling to watch as he holds true to his code and his mission. He defines relentless, even through the final scene. Although the film is filled with terrific performances, Josh Brolin really stands out. This man is certainly on a career roll right now thanks to 'Grindhouse' and 'American Gangster'. Here he is just an everyday guy who stumbles on a drug deal gone way bad. His own personal code ends up creating havoc in an otherwise bland world. Just the way he moves is tells us all we need to know about his thoughts.Each of these very different men stay true to their own code. They are true blue men who lead very different lives but in their heart know there is one right way to be a man. Just great stuff from great filmmakers. I haven't even mentioned the supporting cast with Barry Corbin, Tess Harper, Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald. We just couldn't ask for anymore for the cast or the filmmakers. So whine about the ending if you must ... me, I am just thankful for this work of art.",9,1,8,14 November 2007
Mamma Mia!," Dot ... Dot ... Dot
","Greetings again from the darkness. In the interest of full disclosure, I was not fortunate enough to have seen the Broadway version and I know the stage aficionados are not necessarily pleased with the screen version. Judging it strictly as a film musical, I will say it had me laughing out loud, tapping my toes, singing along (in my head) and most importantly ... fully engaged in the story. This is pure entertainment that most adults will really get a kick out of it.The best place to begin is with the incomparable Meryl Streep. Besides being the best actor and singer in the film, she just knows when to push it and when to let the others have their moment. She is a marvel to behold.The story is simple (and inherently funny) ... 20 yr old daughter reads mom's diary and discovers she has 3 possible fathers and, without her mother's knowledge, invites all 3 to her wedding in hopes of solving the mystery. The three forced-amigos are all well played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard (very much against his type!). None can sing very well, though Brosnan gives it his all ... twice!.To balance the influx of men, we are also treated to Streep's two best friends in brilliant performances by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Sure, you can accuse both of over-acting, by I contend the entertainment value is even higher thanks to their willingness to push the envelope.Streep's daughter is played with extreme bright eyes by Amanda Seyfried, who is just terrific whether singing on the beach or scheming against her unknowing mom. Seyfried's fiancé is played by up and comer Dominic Cooper.Of course, the ABBA music dominates ... it is after all a full fledged MUSICAL. Don't miss Bjorn Ulraeus as the beach piano player! The sing-along songs are just a blast in this setting. If you go in expecting to have fun, you too will find yourself dancing in your seats and humming 'Take A Chance on Me', 'Dancing Queen' or about 6 others.",7,1,2,20 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Zen of Celebrity
","Greetings again from the darkness. The star of this film is Super-Cinematographer Roger Deakins. This guy is a true artist with a camera and thanks to the excruciatingly slow pace here, we get plenty of opportunities to admire his craft. I am not just talking about the stunning snow scenery, but pay attention to the way Mr. Deakins photographs faces and the movements of the actors. It is truly a technical marvel of film-making.As you might guess, when the best thing about the film is the cinematography, it may not deliver the goods from a dramatic standpoint. I won't call this a snoozer, but if the pace were any slower it could have been just as effective as an old fashioned slide show.The film is really not about Jesse James and it really isn't too much about the coward Bob Ford. It really is about one desperate attempt to get famous ... to reach celebrity status. As the old saying goes, be careful what you ask for. Brad Pitt does a nice job capturing the existential side of the famed bank robber, but the film really belongs to Casey Affleck, in his first true lead role. I must admit, Affleck's mumbling and fake naivety wear thin very quickly. Sure he may be the best actor among the Affleck brothers, but is that really saying much? New Zealand director Andrew Dominik put together quite a supporting cast but really doesn't now what to do with it. There is so much wasted talent ... in particular, Sam Shepard and Zooey Deschanel, whose roles appeared to be thrown in at the last minute. Faring better are James Carville in a surprisingly effective role as the Governor, Paul Schneider as a creepy Wood, Nick Cave in a weird scene as a saloon singer, Sam Rockwell as Ford's older brother and the always effective and interesting Michael Parks, who is to 'GD' what Samuel L. Jackson is to 'MF'.As a work of art, this is definitely one to see. From a dramatic standpoint, it is quite a let down.",6,6,13,7 October 2007
Remember the Titans," Racial Tension, Hut, Hut
","Greetings again from the dark!  'Remember the Titans' caught me a little by surprise.  The Disney name and previews did not prepare me for the predominant theme of racism throughout the story.  Because of this, I cannot proclaim this movie to be the first really great 'football movie'.  However, it is a well-made movie loosely based on 1971 racial tension at a high school campus.  Denzel, as usual, dominates his scenes with an in-your-face, holier-than-thou acting style.  The role seems to have been written for him. Only in a Disney movie could you deal with school integration and not once hear the N-word. There are scenes that bring a touch of reality to this film, but most attempts are pretty lame.  The movie is very well paced and beautifully filmed.  Director Boaz Yakin shows flashes of being the real thing.  I am looking forward to his next outing.  Will Patton again shows that he is truly one of the best character actors working in Hollywood today.  Three other actors jumped off the screen.  Ryan Hurst, as Bertier, has the look and presence of a young Russell Crowe.  Child Soap Opera star, Hayden Panettiere, steals her scenes as the young football expert.  A little polishing and she could develop into a true film star.  Kip Pardue, as Sunshine, may be the prettiest actor since Robert Redford in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.  Hopefully he will accept roles that don't alienate us male viewers.  Translated: be a good actor that happens to look great. Overall, I think this movie could be a nice, low-key introduction for kids into what the struggles of racism entailed, as the message is delivered within the confines of feel-good football story.",7,0,2,8 October 2000
Toy Story 4," yet another Pixar classic
","Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, it's another instant classic from Pixar. No, we shouldn't be surprised. Their track record is beyond compare. But I can't help it. How the heck do they do it time after time, movie after movie? We have known (most of) the characters for 25 years now, and this fourth entry seems every bit as fresh and creative as the first one. We like these characters, and it doesn't matter that they are animated. We laugh and cry and worry about them as if they are our friends.Tom Hanks returns as our favorite cowboy Woody (yes, he still has a snake in his boot), and Tim Allen is back as Buzz Lightyear (still unable to grasp that he's not a real space ranger). Also returning is Annie Potts as Bo Peep, now a strong, independent 'lost' toy with excellent survival and scavenging skills. Some new toys and voices inject real pizazz to the adventures. Christina Hendricks charms as Gabby Gabby, a doll quite desperate for her own kid; Keanu Reeves shines as Duke Caboom, a showboating motorcycle stunt rider who may not be as daring as his big talk; and Tony Hale turns Forky into a lovable little cockeyed spork-toy. Also bringing fun and a new comedic element are the hilarious team of Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key as Bunny and Ducky, respectively.The opening sequence takes place 9 years ago, and we see how Bo Peep became separated from the others, and how the toys transitioned to Bonnie and how Bonnie transitioned to Kindergarten, and how Forky transitioned from trash to toy. And fear not, the old favorite toys are all here: Wallace Shawn as Rex, Joan Cusack as Jessie (I expected a bigger role for her), Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants, Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, and courtesy of archival recordings, two posthumous appearances by Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and Bud Luckey as Chuckles the Clown.With his first feature film as director, Josh Cooley follows up his screenplay for the brilliant INSIDE OUT with a touching and superbly funny film. The screenplay comes from Andrew Stanton (2 time Oscar winner, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E) and Stephany Folsom, while the original story credits are many, including John Lasseter in his last project with Pixar. Even though the film is Rated G, it should be noted that it's a pretty complex story for youngsters, and the Charlie McCarthy dolls are kind of terrifying - at least to me and Forky. TOY STORY (1995), TOY STORY 2 (1998), TOY STORY 3 (2010) get the send-off they deserve, so 'move your plush' and go see it! Randy Newman is back with a new song, as well as the familiar melody and lyrics from his Oscar nominated 'You've Got a Friend in Me' ... a friend indeed.",9,35,87,17 June 2019
Batman Begins," It's all very technical
","Greetings again from the darkness. Fans of the Dark Knight (like me) have been waiting anxiously for this project. Anticipation built when Christopher Nolan ('Memento') was named director and suspense grew as many young bucks pursued the lead. 'American Psycho' created many cries of 'WHO?', but those in the know, were pleased and the anticipation grew. Slowly the supporting cast was put in place: Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, the great Rutger Hauer and even Michael Caine! Then began the year long wait.Although the final product disappoints on some fronts: Katie Holmes is bloody AWFUL, there is never a good clear shot of the batsuit and Bruce Wayne lacks the elegance that we would expect, we leave the theatre pretty satisfied. Christian Bale is a terrific Batman (even though he never gets Bruce quite right), the fight scenes are above average, the Gotham City set is truly impressive, seeing the progression from child to young adult is interesting and the film's sound is top notch.What really sets this one apart is the multitude of film locations. Nolan took the show on the road to capture the right feel for Neeson's tutoring of Bale and the city shots are often spectacular. The biggest thing this one lacks is the colorful villain that the Batman comics were known for. Cillian Murphy is bone-chilliing as The Scarecrow, but we know immediately he is not THE bad guy. Many will complain that the film is too dark - both visually and emotionally. Visually speaking, this is Gotham at its absolute low point. Emotionally ... hey, at least its not 'Batman and Robin'",8,2,4,19 June 2005
The Fault in Our Stars," Grace
","Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read John Green's book, and missing his targeted demographics by gender and a few decades, the narrator's very early criticism of my favorite teen movie 'Say Anything ...' had me quickly questioning whether I was going to make it through this one. The greatness of Shailene Woodley soon won me over and I was all in.The story revolves around a teenage girl named Hazel(Woodley) who was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, and has remained alive and active thanks to an experimental drug. She is an exceptionally perceptive girl and carries the burden of worrying about how (or if) her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell) will carry on after her death. She attends a teenage support group to keep her parents happy, and bumps into a friendship with a spirited young man named Gus (Ansel Elgort) ... a self-labeled one-legged 18 year old virgin cancer survivor.You guessed it ... this is a tear-jerker. But it's even more of a love story. Specifically, it's a story about the joy in finding someone to love. While the cancer is ever-present, it's the love story that captures our interest. When the story veers from that, it suffers. The trip to Amsterdam and the segment with Willem Dafoe seems out of place until it's eclipsed by the final scene at the Anne Frank house. I understand the point, but it struck me as forced emotions ... in a movie that was not lacking emotion.Regardless of all of that, the reason to see this is the genius of Shailene Woodley. Neither she nor Elgort are teenagers, but they perfectly capture the adorable balance between awkward and witty. Woodley's range is staggering (The Descendants, The Spectacular Now, Divergent) and she and Jennifer Lawrence should be blessing us with their talent for many many years to come.The screenplay was co-written by Scott Neustadler and Michael H Weber who also co-wrote both (500) Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now. Their feel for dialogue and budding relationships is spot on, delivering a level of respect to both sexes. This film is very sweet and filled with grace, and tainted only by the saccharine musical choices and the Amsterdam sequence.",7,2,7,8 June 2014
Climax," hypnotic or horrific depending on your taste
","Greetings again from the darkness. A wounded, bleeding, hysterical woman is seen crawling through the snow. She's not dressed appropriately for the weather, and it's apparent she's suffered some type of trauma. This opening shot is from a bird's eye view, and it's the way provocative filmmaker Gaspar Noe (LOVE, ENTER THE VOID) opens his latest film. This vivid visual sticks with us as we flashback to the progression of events that led to this woman's unfortunate circumstance ... her situation being the conclusion to what we are about to watch.The initial dance sequence is shown in full and it is quite stunning in its energy and physicality and athleticism. As best I could tell, it was a single long take with dancers writhing and music thumping, both in frenetic mode. Much of each dancer's personality is depicted in their movements, and the video interviews we see as part of their audition reveal a culturally diverse group of young adults unsure of where this is headed. We are watching a troupe of mid-1990's French dancers rehearsing in a large, otherwise empty facility on a snowy night, and we too are unprepared for what's about to unfold.After that initial performance, the dancers begin mingling as the camera takes us inside the various conversations. Lust, jealousy, and insecurities fill the air as the choreographed energy we first watched in awe slowly disintegrates into a bizarre type of hand-to-hand combat ... some psychological, some more physical/violent in nature. The dancers are slipping from sanity, unsure if it's temporary or possibly deadly. One of them traces their spinning head (not literal) and unexplained sensations to the Sangria punch - leading to some angry confrontations and outrageous behavior.While none of the individual performances really stand out ... this is not a film about certain interesting characters ... it should be noted that Sofia Boutella (HOTEL ARTEMIS) plays Selva, the dance company's choreographer, and Kiddy Smile plays Daddy, the DJ who keeps the music pumping. Watching the movie is truly like observing a group acid trip through the eyes of someone on an acid trip. The camera is sometimes invading intimate moments, while other times hovering or wildly spinning above or below. Sometimes it felt like a GoPro was strapped to a frantic parakeet that had just been set free from its cage.Combining the camera work with the constant thundering of music, some might describe the film as hypnotic and hallucinatory (I prefer horrific).
While most of the dancers seem to lose all sense of reality, some react more violently than others. Hysterics run rampant, especially in a sequence where a young boy is locked in a utility closet by his mother. Whether the scene was for shock value or merely in keeping with the filmmaker's demented approach is unclear - either way, this came across as too much on top of too much. Simply put, the film is a relentless assault on the eyes and ears and all sense of decency ... just as Gaspar Noe likely intended.",5,1,2,15 March 2019
To Rome With Love," Ozymandias Melancholy
","Greetings again from the darkness. I certainly consider myself a fan of Woody Allen's films and am in awe of his prolific ability to write and direct a new movie most every year since 1969. With so many films to his credit, it's expected that a few will be clunkers. After a pretty nice run of non-New York based films, his love letter to Rome falls short ... not from lack of ambition, but rather from a feeling that these stories have been on his 'to do' list for too many years. They feel mostly stale and dated.With one of the world's most beautiful and interesting cities as a backdrop, Mr. Allen delivers four stories - none of which intersect with the others. There are some similar shared themes, but mostly what the four stories have in common is mass overacting by all involved. Surprisingly, the one exception might be Alec Baldwin, whose wise-cracking lines are played pretty close to the vest. Unfortunately, all of the other key actors seem to think they are onstage at a dinner theatre and that hyper-activity and bellowing lines are lines required.In one story, Woody Allen (his first acting gig since Scoop) and Judy Davis head to Rome to meet their daughter's (Alison Pill) fiancé (Flavio Parenti). Allen overhears the father singing in the shower and works out a scheme to get him an audition that leads to a career. The father is played by famed Opera tenor Fabio Armiliato and this story is so goofy, it could easily fit into Allen's 'early funny ones'.Another story has newlyweds played by Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandro Mastronardi in a series of innocent happenstance that leads to some not so innocent events that include her favorite actor (Antonio Albanes) and high-priced call girl (Penelope Cruz). Most of this has the feel of a Benny Hill skit.Jesse Eisenberg and his girlfriend Greta Gerwig share time with her visiting friend played by Ellen Page. This is the Alec Baldwin sequence and he is a near-ghost-like entity who pops in to provide obvious advice or warning to the players so they don't make the same mistakes he made as a younger man. This sequence had potential, but never amounted to much.The fourth story is just an absurd commentary on reality TV and instant fame. Roberto Begnini plays a normal Italian citizen and family man who one day gets thrust into the world of celebrity for no apparent reason. See, that's the joke. Probably ten years past the time when this was relevant.Bashing Woody Allen is not my intent here. Simply pointing out that there are four stories and numerous actors and none of it struck a chord with me. Not to say there weren't a few well written lines and a couple of terrific shots of Rome ... just not enough to keep me going for two hours.",5,2,5,21 July 2012
Bridesmaids," Hold On
","Greetings again from the darkness. Kristen Wiig is everywhere these days. If you don't know the name, you certainly know her face. She is credited with 26 projects since 2009 - and that doesn't even count her weekly work on Saturday Night Live. She is the new Tina Faye ... even though the old Tina Faye is still going very strong.While I have little doubt that the success of The Hangover was a driving force behind the creation of this film, Ms. Wiig's writing and acting talent elevate this mixture of chick-flick and comedy into one of the finest female film comedies in quite awhile. That's probably not strong enough praise since that category is a bit sparse, but as a guy who gets really tired of the formulaic chick-flick rom-coms and sappy dramas, I found the film to be quite refreshing.Sure, there are many similarities between this and The Hangover, but the key difference is that the element of female friendship is never far away from the often raunchy comedy we are witnessing. Women so value their BFF's and Ms. Wiig and her writing partner Annie Mumolo (seen as a nervous plane passenger) never lose sight of this.Also key to any group of female activity is the competitive nature and envious mutterings. They try so hard to appear happy for their friends, when often they are blinded by the current funk in which they find their own life. And look out when a beautiful, rich 'new' friend enters the picture. The real fireworks begin ... even in the battle for the last word on the mic at the engagement party! I am not going to give away any of the punchlines or set-ups, but I will highlight the cast. Maya Rudolph is Lillian, the bride to be and lifelong friend of Annie (Wiig); Ellie Kemper (The Office) is Becca, the goody-two shoes newlywed; Wendi McLendon-Covey (Reno 911) is Rita, the bitter, frustrated long-time mother and wife looking for inspiration; Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly, Gilmore Girls) is Megan, the slapstick, gross-out comedy relief; Rose Byrne is Helen, the aforementioned seemingly perfect 'new' friend; Chris O'Dowd (Blind Swordsman in Dinner for Schmucks) is Officer Rhodes, the nice guy who has a crush on Annie; Jon Hamm (Mad Men) as Annie's Porsche driving bootie call; and Jill Clayburgh (her final film role) as Annie's mom.Here is hoping Ms. Wiig continues to push the boundaries of creative comedy for women. I for one look forward to seeing women on screen as more than just love interests and femme fatales.",7,1,4,29 May 2011
Non-Stop," Free Flights for Everyone!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Hollywood is a true believer in the theory that imitation is the greatest form of flattery. The constant attempts to capture the same lightning bolt in the same bottle would be kind of funny, if not so frustrating for us movie-goers. Liam Neeson's surprise hit with 2008's Taken spawned not just a Taken sequel, but now two movies from director Jaume Collet-Serra - this one and the disappointing Unknown. Oh well, it's easy money for Neeson and it's not the worst early year release.It's been 20 years since Liam Neeson's Oscar nominated performance in Schindler's List. Rather than a great actor, he might best be described as a familiar screen presence ... a guy we can somehow relate to most of the time. Well, at least until he unleashes his particular set of skills ... this time in an airplane lavatory! The set up for this thriller is quite promising. Neeson plays an alcoholic US Air Marshal looking and sounding quite beaten down by life in the first few minutes. Once on his flight, he receives a text informing him that someone onboard will be killed every 20 minutes until $150 million is transferred into his account. It's a combination hijacking, extortion, whodunnit murder mystery and blackmail story. Unfortunately the three first time screenwriters (one of whom 'wrote' for the WWE) botch every possible twist and turn. With a plane full of suspects, we play right along with Neeson as he begins the process. We've enjoyed the claustrophobic approach to movie thrillers before in such movies as Flight, Air Force One, Flightplan and even Phone Booth.For whatever reason, this plane never feels cramped and the tight spaces only come into play with the aforementioned lavatory fight scene, and even that seems like the most spacious airplane restroom of all-time. Even the multiple drop-dead deadlines aren't really played for full effect, and the decent supporting cast isn't given much to do, save for looking suspiciously at Neeson.Julianne Moore co-stars, but mostly her role consists of disbelieving stares and a tilt of the head. Corey Stoll (House of Cards) gets a few juicy scenes, as does the always interesting Scoot McNairy. Unfortunately, Oscar nominee Lupita Nyong'o, Shea Whigham, Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey), and Nate Parker have little to do, and the absolute wasting of Anson Mount is a crime.If you are skittish about flying, there is no reason to see this one, though the convoluted motive and lackluster reveal might help you forget the story takes place on an international flight. The one thing we do learn is that Liam Neeson can take a fire extinguisher to the head and bounce right back up without a mark. Let's add that to his particular set of skills, while we less than anxiously await yet another collaboration between Neeson and this director coming in 2015.",5,4,10,2 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Not a Zero
","Greetings again from the darkness. Some of the finer things in life are an acquired taste. The exception to that is writer/director Wes Anderson's films. You either 'get' it or you don't. Which side of the line you fall is much more a matter of style and taste than intellect.This latest from Anderson may be his most visually distinct and stylistic presentation yet. He even tosses in a bit of a plot so that we have reason to follow the outlandish antics of master concierge (and murder suspect) M Gustave - played with comic verve by Ralph Fiennes. Yes, the Ralph Fiennes known for such comedy classics as Schindler's List, The English Patient and The Hurt Locker. Admit it, when you need a laugh, you fire up the Ralph Fiennes stand-up routine. OK, so he did have a role in the terrific In Bruges, but nothing has prepared us for seeing him in this witty, fast-talking role at the center of Anderson's wildest ride yet.As any follower of Anderson films will tell you, there is always fun to be had in picking out the members of his supporting cast. Assisting Mr. Fiennes with this one are Edward Norton, Jude Law, F Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton (oddly cast after Angela Lansbury dropped out), Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Lea Seydoux, Mathieu Amalric, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. Of course, there is also Bill Murray, in his seventh collaboration with Anderson. The most impressive new face is that of Tony Revolori, who plays the teenage Lobby Boy in training ... a role that turns vital when he is befriended by Gustave.None of that really matters though, as the best description I give this is spectacle. It's a whimsical romp with nostalgic tributes throughout. It's a movie for movie lovers from a true movie lover. You will notice the three distinct aspect ratios used to depict the different time periods, and the music is perfect ... from Vivaldi's Concerto for Lute and Plucked Strings to Alexandre Desplat's fantastic composition over the closing credits. If you are up for some hyper-stylistic eye candy, this one is tough to beat (especially this time of year).",8,2,10,16 March 2014
The Favourite," Yorgos and 3 great actresses
","Greetings again from the darkness. Our biggest fear was that Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos would one day soften the twisted edge he blessed us with in THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017), THE LOBSTER (2015), and DOGTOOTH (2009). That day may yet arrive, but not today and not with his latest. It's his first time to direct a screenplay he didn't write, which likely explains this being his most accessible film - though labeling it 'mainstream' would be a huge stretch. So brace yourself for an unusual and odd costume period piece unlike anything you've seen before.Co-writers Deborah Davis (her first screenplay) and Tony McNamara (TV background) deliver biting dialogue and treacherous situations, and benefit from three staggeringly terrific lead actress performances. Olivia Colman stars as Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah Churchill, and Emma Stone is Abigail. The three combine for one of the strangest and most convoluted love triangles and power struggles in history.It's very early 18th century and Britain is at war with France. Queen Anne is frail and in ill health due to severe gout and who knows how many other ailments. Her erratic behavior and quick temper convey childlike behavior from an adult body with a crown. Lady Sarah (Winston's great-great grandmother, if I've calculated correctly) has strategically become the Queen's trusted political advisor and often governs in her stead, while also sharing moments of intimacy. Sarah pulls no punches and certainly doesn't subscribe to the 'kill 'em with kindness' approach, and instead frequently insults the Queen to her face. When Sarah's cousin Abigail appears after her family's fall from grace (her father lost her in a card game), Sarah takes pity on her due to Sarah's fondness of Abigail's father during her childhood.Abigail's naivety and kindness soon win over the Queen's affections. Is her sweetness an act? Is it due to ambition or desperation ... is there even a difference here? We soon learn Abigail treats conniving as a profession - she views it as her only path back to respectability, and she's willing to take on many acts lacking in respectability to charm her way into the inner sanctum. We are plopped into the wicked fun, delicious cat-fighting, strategic backstabbing and crafty political and personal maneuverings ... right up until the story turns to vicious bleak darkness in the final act.It's fascinating to watch three women hold the power during this era, as the noblemen are relegated to constantly playing catch-up (kind of like the real world) and struggling to figure out the rules of the game. Power struggles abound, as do director Lanthimos stylistic touches. Noblemen played by Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn are frequently dressed in frilly costumes, giant wigs and heavy make-up - quite the contrast to what we typically see in these period pieces. Other Lanthimos touches include royal duck races, pet bunnies representing deceased children, and fisheye lenses used from every conceivable angle.Ms. Colman and Ms. Weisz were both in THE LOBSTER, and both have a knack for the Lanthimos style, and Ms. Stone surprisingly is also a natural with the twisted, vicious material. Each of the actresses have an extended close-up allowing them to show-off their immense and subtle talent ... Ms. Colman's is especially impactful. Extreme profanity (numerous c-words and f-words) is at times startling and effective, and the music is unique and diverse - as we would expect. As an added bonus, it requires little imagination to connect the dots to our contemporary political state, although that approach would likely stifle one's enjoyment of the film. Mr. Lanthimos has quickly reached the 'must-see' list of directors, with a guarantee that we are going to see something unusual and interesting. It's one of the year's best, even if it's not for everyone.",8,6,14,30 November 2018
Seabiscuit," Not the book, but very good by Hollywood standards
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Yes I am one of those who love Laura Hillenbrand's book, but I will not bash the movie.  It is impossible for a 2 hour movie to get all the details accurate for a 10 year story.  I was a little disappointed that the filmmakers chose to go the route of a feel-good, rah-rah film and totally ignore some of the darker aspects of this fascinating story ... but I do understand.  Terrific acting by Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard, Jeff Bridges as Mr. Howard, Chris Cooper as Tom Smith and Elizabeth Banks (Spider-Man) as Mrs. Howard.  Really thought Bridges captured the spirit of Mr. Howard in both pain and happiness.  He is a tremendous talent, and quite underrated.  Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens as George Woolf was nice casting, but again the emphasis on the 'nice' part of the relationship left me a bit empty.  Some of the race scenes were breathtaking, but a bit too much slow-motion and way too many cut-aways.  I am no horse expert, but it appeared they used a few horses for Seabiscuit and the bobbing head did not match any of them.  Overall, a nice movie going experience, but I suggest everyone read the book!",8,0,0,28 July 2003
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Accomplished
","Greetings again from the darkness. You should know that as serious as I am about movies, I am perfectly comfortable accepting the Mission Impossible franchise for what it is ... a thrilling roller coaster ride of breathtaking stunts, outlandish missions, stunning visuals, bone-jarring fights, and above all else, Tom Cruise. Mr. Cruise is back in his element as Agent Ethan Hunt ... equal parts sleuth, cage fighter and super hero.This is the fourth installment of the re-boot which began in 1996. Cruise was in his mid-30's then, and is pushing 50 now. In remarkable physical condition, he seems to take great pride in his ability to pull off these fantastic stunts. However, he tops them all here as he hangs from the world's tallest building - Burj Khalifa in Dubai. This is one of the most impressive action stunt sequences ever seen, with multiple camera angles that will definitely jar your senses if you are the least bit sensitive to heights. This alone is worth the price of admission.No need to go into much detail as the plot/mission is as ridiculous as the others in the franchise. Ethan's team is made up of computer geek and walking one-liner Simon Pegg as Benji; Paula Patton (Precious) as Jane (must have a pretty woman); and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) as Brandt, the world's most dangerous 'analyst'. This team is chasing after Michael Nyqvist (Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), who plays Hendricks ... a European loony trying to nuke the world for no apparent reason. To get to Hendricks, the team must go through a filthy rich playboy played by Amil Kapoor (Slumdog Millionaire) and a trained assassin played by Lea Seydoux (Midnight in Paris).This latest installment is directed by Brad Bird, straight from Pixar via Ratatouille and The Incredibles, both of which prepared him for this first live action thriller. With an eye for action sequences and a feel for lapses in dialogue, Mr. Bird's first live action outing is quite impressive. Plus, he included an endless stream of gadgets, technology, fight scenes and crazy stunts. My only real complaint is that the iconic Lalo Schifrin theme song never really cuts loose like it should. Still, if you liked the first three, you will like this one.",7,5,11,15 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," The Wheelers aren't so special
","Greetings again from the darkness. Evidently I am one of the few who didn't like the movie, and just to be clear, that doesn't bother me one iota. This is a depressing, non-message movie stuck in an unrealistic setting with characters who we don't care the least bit about. The fact that the American Beauty and Road to Perdition director assembled such a strong cast doesn't override the fact that it is just not a good film.Basically we get a chance meeting at a party between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Love at first sight seems to happen because he is a longshoreman and she is an actress-wannabe who has never been anywhere or done anything. When she says he is the most interesting man she has ever met, we can only assume that he must also be the first. Besides that ... what does he see in her? Flashforward a few years to a miserable life in early 60's suburbia and a couple of kids and we are then subjected to 90 minutes of screaming and bickering and crying and depression and anger. You know there is an entire segment of the law (and a Tammy Wynette song) just for these situations ... it is called D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Just do it folks. The whole thing is just ridiculous. And where are the KIDS?? They are only in a couple of scenes. Not sure how that happens. I know my kids were around the house most of their childhood.The most interesting character in the movie is the white-jacket worthy son of Kathy Bates played by Michael Shannon (the mysterious marine seen in World Trade Center). His twisted and vile psychoanalysis of Leo and Kate is spot on, though ridiculous in itself.Director Sam Mendes (Kate's real life husband) is blessed to have Winslet and DiCaprio cast or this film would die a quick death at the box office and most assuredly would not end up on any best of lists for this year. Based on Richard Yates' novel, the only explanation I have for the terrific reviews is that they are a product of the reputation of the novel and the high profile parties involved, and not for the finished project of this film. For a significantly better film with similar material, see Todd Haynes' 'Far From Heaven'.",4,10,19,4 January 2009
Foxcatcher," The Eagle has Crash Landed
","Greetings again from the darkness. The 1996 newscast remains vivid in my mind. It was captivating due to the bizarre circumstances and the tragedy involving an athlete whose Olympic career I had followed closely. Initially, I had trouble reconciling the story of this popular world class athlete and the mentally troubled billionaire who was part of one of America's richest and most iconic families. This movie fills in some of the gaps.Director Bennett Miller (Capote, Moneyball) is a meticulous filmmaker and is never in a hurry as a story teller. He allows the characters to develop on screen at their own pace ... and this time the pace is excruciatingly slow - in a brilliant, yet painful to watch manner. The lead characters are a diverse trio of men. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) won Olympic Gold in 1984, but he is shy and withdrawn to the point of being socially awkward and unable to capitalize on his victory. His older brother Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) also won a Gold Medal in 1984, and is very engaging family man who helped raise Mark, while building endorsements and job opportunities for himself. The triumvirate is completed by the incredibly odd billionaire John DuPont (Steve Carell), who proclaims himself a wrestling coach after building a state of the art training facility on his family estate. The ultra rich can do such things.John DuPont was never able to live up to his mother's (Vanessa Redgrave) standards. She even paid the chauffeur's son to be John's friend as they were growing up. With Mark always in the shadow of his more popular brother, DuPont seizes the opportunity to capitalize on Mark's vulnerability and invite him to lead his Foxcatcher wrestling team (named after the estate which is near Valley Forge). DuPont's ultimate goal is to also have Dave join them, but it's a tougher sell for various reasons.The mommy issues and brother issues drive the need for validation and are at the core of story here, as are ego, 'patriotism', and ultimately delusion. Steve Carell sports a nose apparatus that captures the reason DuPont nicknamed himself the 'eagle'. He also kicks his head back, while slumping his shoulders, in physically capturing DuPont's unorthodox movements. But that's nothing compared to the eerie aura he puts off whenever he must deal with another person. He sends up red flags to anyone even minimally aware of their surroundings, but to a lost soul like Mark, he becomes a father figure and 'coach'.A wrestling movie would figure to be male dominated, but even with that, Sienna Miller (as Dave's wife) and Vanessa Redgrave (as Jean DuPont) are almost non-existent as the only female characters. Anthony Michael Hall has a brief supporting role, and it's nice to see Guy Boyd back on screen as well. However, most every scene is some mixture of Carell, Tatum and Ruffalo, and they each deliver. It's a side of Carell we have never before seen (many of the greatest comics have a dark side), and Tatum is spot on as the hulking, sulking Mark, while Ruffalo captures the easy charm and sensitivity of Dave.The story offers further proof that life can be stranger than fiction ... especially when it involves an insecure and mentally unstable billionaire who envisions himself as a leader of men.",7,2,8,30 November 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," We can't all be lion tamers
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's been over 50 years since the film's initial release and more than 20 since I last viewed it on the big screen. When Cinemark announced it as part of the Classic Film Series, I circled the date on my calendar. While most movies are best viewed in a theatre setting, no other film absolutely demands such a setting.There are many elements that contribute to the well deserved 'classic' label: David Lean's direction, Freddie Young's photography, the star-studded support cast, the historical significance, Maurice Jarre's iconic score, and of course, Peter O'Toole's standout and unusual performance. This is an action-adventure film with up close battle scenes filmed with no CGI aid. The famous shot of Omar Sharif's Sheriff Ali slowly making his initial appearance on the desert horizon is breathtaking on a 60 foot screen. Watching Lawrence's victory dance on top of the train is majestic in the theatre, and the big screen provides the necessary ominous feeling as the Arabs slowly navigate the blowing sands of the Nefud Desert.T.E. Lawrence was a fascinating man, though there has been much debate about the film and his legend. Lawrence's own writings in 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom' provided many details used by screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, as well as the writings of American photo-journalist Lowell Thomas ... depicted in the film as Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). The real life Thomas was looking for a hero and likely sensationalized his story of Lawrence, but most believe the foundation is fairly accurate.While the story of T.E. Lawrence is incredibly interesting, the story in the film is somehow just part of the experience. Director David Lean's movie is a true experience for movie lovers. This was Mr. Lean's middle film of an incredible streak of three ... The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) being the others. Lean insisted on filming on location, rather than in studio despite the nearly four hour run time. This decision drove the cost up, but allowed for the stunning visuals that set it apart.In addition to O'Toole's performance, it is quite exciting to see the dynamic Omar Sharif, the powerful Anthony Quinn (as Auda abu Tayi), the classy Alec Guiness (as Prince Faisal), the kinda creepy Jose Ferrer, the familiar Jack Hawkins and the slightly slimy Claude Rains. Missing from this list is any actress. The movie features exactly zero speaking roles for women.Maybe the only two actors of the era who could have competed with this fabulous landscape were Peter O'Toole and Marlon Brando. Brando was actually first cast as Lawrence, but soon dropped out to star in Mutiny on the Bounty. O'Toole's blue eyes and white robe created quite the contrast to the sandy desert. Speaking of contrast, the two times he admires his reflection in his knife are visual keys to his evolution from God complex to broken man. After attending the premiere, writer Noel Coward told O'Toole, 'If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia.' The movie received 10 Oscar nominations. It walked away with 7 wins including Best Picture, Director, Cinematogapher, and Score. O'Toole lost out to Gregory Peck (To Kill a Mockingbird). Mr. O'Toole has received 8 Best Actor nominations without ever winning. Watching this film (more than once) is a must for any movie lover. The opportunities to view it in a theatre setting are quite rare, so please seize the chance should it present itself. Your four hour commitment will be rewarded with a movie memory you'll never lose.",10,1,3,27 March 2013
It Follows," Tag, You're it
","Greetings again from the darkness. Known for an endless stream of copycats and re-treads, the horror genre periodically surprises us with a dose of originality. Heck, we don't even ask horror filmmakers for anything too revolutionary  just give us something we haven't seen a few dozen times before. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell 'gets it' and delivers a game of psycho-sexual-tag-you're-it featuring the most sinister STD ever.A definite departure from the all-too-common teen slasher films, the slow-drip terror of this one has more in common with dread and eventuality than scream-inducing terror and 'made you jump' scares. When we first meet Jay (Maika Monroe), she is a typical pushing-twenty student who enjoys leisurely swims in her suburban backyard pool, hanging out with friends, and a healthy dating scene. Well, healthy until one evening of back seat passion with Hugh (Jake Weary) sets off the above-mentioned sinistry. See Jake has purposefully 'passed on' some kind of affliction that attracts a death-seeking entity who slowly, but purposefully pursues its target. Supposedly the only options are to be killed or pass it on through more passion  the worst kind of 'pay it forward'.Jay is supported in her ongoing attempts to avoid the entity by her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe), her neighbor and classmate Greg (Daniel Zovatto), and Paul (Keir Gilchrist) her not-so-secret admirer who would do anything to protect her. The big catch is that only Jay can see the entity  making heroism quite elusive for her support group.Lest there be any doubt of the dire situation, director Mitchell begins the movie with a very vivid example of the likely result in being 'caught' by the entity, and adds the score from composer Disasterpeace  an ominous throwback techno-sound that would be distracting if not so fitting. This has all the makings of a breakout role for Maika Monroe, with similarities to Jamie Lee Curtis in the original Halloween movie (1978).The low budget caused some obvious production limitations – in particular an awkward bounce from day to night and back again, and some iffy effects. However, the suburban Detroit setting provides a nice backdrop, and of special note are the Redford Theatre (est 1928) replete with its beautiful pipe organ, and the indoor swimming pool put to spectacular use in the film's climax. As long as the audience is not expecting the typical teen slasher, this creative horror film should gain an audience while putting director David Robert Mitchell on the fast track to bigger budget films.",7,76,146,9 February 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," It's a Madhouse! A Madhouse!
","Greetings again from the darkness. As a young kid I saw the original Planet of the Apes at a drive-in with my parents. At the time, I mostly just thought the talking apes were cool and enjoyed the surprise ending, despite having no ability to really process the statement that Pierre Boulle (novel) and Rod Serling (screenplay) were making. Since then, I have had a soft spot for the series, including the Tim Burton version 10 years ago.As you can tell by the title, this latest version is truly a pre-quel. It is meant to explain the beginnings of how the Apes gained intelligence and created a powerful society that would one day rule humans. It begins in a genetic engineering lab run by James Franco and his team. They are using chimps to test an experimental drug that will hopefully be used to treat and cure Alzheimer's. In fact, Mr. Franco's father is played by John Lithgow, a once renowned musician and teacher, who is now suffering the effects of this horrible disease.When things go wrong at the lab, Franco breaks most every known law and tests the drug on dear old dad. Of course, it works miracles. The accident in the lab, leads Franco to adopt a baby chimp born to one of the chimps used to test the drug. This chimp quickly becomes the smartest one in the house, neighborhood and city. Named Caesar, his learning curve is off the charts. And yes, after a couple of years, his strength and temper are as well.After yet another accident, Caesar is put away in a chimp camp run by greedy Brian Cox and sadistic Tom Felton (Draco of Harry Potter fame). Caesar uses his intelligence and the unsuspecting and unobservant nature of the humans to organize a coup. This part is really something to behold.By far the best acting in the film is delivered by Andy Serkis. Don't recognize the name? You might know him better as King Kong or Gollum in Lord of the Rings. Mr. Serkis is a motion-capture actor-extraordinare. It is sometimes difficult to tell where these effects stop and the CGI begins, but overall the look of the chimps is pretty good and the action sequences are downright amazing.What hurts the film is the weakness of the human stories. Franco as a genius scientist? Doesn't work for me. Freida Pinto as a primate specialist? The script gives her nothing to work with. Lithgow and Cox are excellent actors, but mere pawns in this story.Director Rupert Wyatt tips a cap to the original film a few times: tribute names such as Bright Eyes and Dodge Landon, an orange orangutan named Maurice (in honor of Maurice Evans), a quick glimpse of a Statue of Liberty puzzle, horse-back riding, Charlton Heston on TV (as Moses), and a couple of classic lines including 'stinking paws'.In what was supposed to be a transition story, this one really belongs to the apes ... and it's teed up beautifully for a sequel just across the Golden Gate.",6,8,17,12 August 2011
City of God," What was purgatory is now Hell
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Oscar nominated director Fernando Meireilos' film is based on a true story from the slums outside of Rio. This compelling drama literally takes us inside the ultra violent drug world run by the rawest form of machismo.  From an early age, kids are drawn to the power and elite status (so-called respect) that this sick world offers. No one really escapes.  This world is just a giant circle of blood and death where the parts are continously replaced by someone more violent.  Failure comes to those who try to walk away or run away.  This world provides only one way out.  The story is told from the perspective of Rocket, a boy who manages to escape joining a gang since he is seen as pretty harmless and is the younger brother of one of the early trio of thugs.  Rocket finds his redemption through a camera and actually capitalizes on this brutal underworld to crack the door to a life as a journalistic photographer.  The real story here is the lack of hope and the total desperation from such an early age.  Many scenes are so graphic as to cause this viewer to cringe and even look away from the screen.  Such a powerful, yet sad message delivered by the some of the finest film art one could hope for.",8,0,2,15 February 2004
The Little Mermaid," What's that word ... Excellence
","Greetings again from the darkness. The first of three true classics from the 'middle era' of Disney animation ... along with Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) ... this 1989 version of Hans Christian Anderson's 1837 story brought musical theatre to an animated children's fairy tale. It was also the 28th Disney film, and the final to utilize hand-painted cel animation.The Blu-Ray release to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary is truly stunning in color, brightness, clarity and sound. An explosion of sight and sound occurs during the incredible cacophony of joy and cheer better known as the Best Song Oscar winner 'Under the Sea'. The calypso style was a very creative choice by musical directors Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.Of course, the star of the show is Ariel, the rebellious 16 year old mermaid who dreams of walking on the beach and dancing with the Prince. Ariel's remarkable vocals ('Part of Your World') are provided by Jodi Benson, who beautifully captures the innocence and longing necessary for the character. Samuel E Wright is the smooth voiced Jamaican crab Sebastian, who not only takes lead on 'Under the Sea', but also on 'Kiss the Girl'. The other standout is Pat Carroll as Ursula the Sea Witch. She is the perfect villain vs Ariel, and is quite a commentary on the actions of those who are power hungry.Written and directed by John Clements and Ron Musker, the film was a bit different for its time because of the depth of Ariel's character. This was a typical teenager going against her strict parent and dreaming of a better life. Ariel has a mind of her own and is willing to chase her dreams ... even if it's a boy from the proverbial 'other side of the tracks' and with a Faustian negotiation. From a technical perspective, the artwork is spectacular and movements are full and fluid (sorry for the pun). This came 5 years after Ron Howard's live action Splash with Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah. If you ever doubt the power that expert animation can possess, just compare the emotion and charm in those two.This latest Blu-Ray release has some very interesting special features. We are treated to interviews with the film's animators as well as a peek inside the Disney Animation studios, now on its third generation of animators. Much reverence is provided to The Nine Old Men ... the original group of animators hand picked by Walt Disney. The last of the nine men died in 2008, and their trainees are now mentoring the most excited new group that is kicking out some new classics like Frozen and Wreck-it Ralph. What's that word ... circle of life.",10,4,4,23 January 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," big
","Greetings again from the darkness. We are at the 10 year mark of the new Marvel cinematic universe that began with the revolutionary IRON MAN (2008). This 19th movie in the franchise is actually Part 1 of 2 films that will (supposedly) be the lasting legacy of The Avengers. The second 'half', much of which was filmed simultaneously with this one, is set for 2019. Co-directing brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were responsible for the two most recent Captain America movies (and also one of my all-time least favorites: YOU, ME AND DUPREE), and have now taken on the biggest budget, biggest cast, and longest run time yet of any Marvel movie. In fact, it's so big, it could only be named 'Infinity'. Being that the fan base for this movie is highly sensitive to anything resembling a hint, much less a spoiler, this review will tread very lightly, and instead function as an overview with very general observations. There are a few key points, most of which are quite obvious from either the trailers or the previous movies in the series. First thing to realize is that this is a Thanos movie. He's the first big (I told you everything was big), bad, nearly omnipotent villain. It should be noted that Thanos sees himself as misunderstood, which leads to the second key point: melodrama abounds - moreso than any previous comic book movie. It seems to be reminding us that Superheroes are people too (but are they really?). The third point is that if every character with a speaking part simply said 'I am Spartacus', it would still likely be the longest ever comic book movie. There are at least 28 characters with 'key' roles - and that's not counting the end credit stinger, or the missing characters we thought we would see, or the one that gets a logo tease as a coming attraction for part 2. Co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus had their hands full in working to come up with a coherent story, while allowing so many familiar characters to have at least one moment in the spotlight, if not a few. The fact that AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR divided the group actually allows for multiple segments to play out concurrently. Though we never doubt these fragmented cliques and isolated individuals will fight to save the galaxy, that doesn't necessarily mean they get the band back together. In fact, it's the Guardians of the Galaxy who are a much more cohesive group than our beloved Avengers. But fear not ... there is plenty of fighting and action to go around.Thanos claims he is saving many interplanetary civilizations and restoring balance with his plan to eliminate half of all living beings. While there might be some scientific evidence to back up his plan, it doesn't sit well with the good guys. More focus is given to his cravings for ultimate control and power provided by tracking down all six Infinity Stones (Tesseract/Space, Mind, Time, Power, Reality, and Soul) to complete his Infinity Gauntlet. Many of these stones are in quite inconvenient locations and require some ingenuity and brute force from Thanos.Perhaps the travel agent had the biggest challenge as portions of the film take place in New York City, Knowhere, and Wakanda (good luck finding a brochure on those last two). We also get a budding romance from Vision and Scarlet Witch, as well as annoying quasi-romantic banter between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. And while we are on the 'TMZ' portion of the review, it should be noted that both Black Widow and Captain America (introducing himself as Steve Rogers) both have new hair styles - though only one of them sports a beard. In the realm of comic book movies, this would be considered an epic. It has stunning action sequences, remarkable special effects and some terrific comedy mixed in. Of course, you'll have to accept the melodramatic emotions and fear that we haven't been previously subjected, and know that the final finality doesn't arrive for another year. It's very long (more than 2 ½ hours) but it seems to go pretty quickly. The filmmakers have mostly succeeded in the monumental task of remaining true to the history in order to keep comic book fans satisfied, while also creating something that most should be entertained by. Despite lacking the upbeat, feel-good ending we've grown accustomed to, there is a welcome Stan Lee cameo, a post credit stinger (after about 10 minutes of rolling credits). And to top it off, we get 'Rubberband Man' from The Spinners. Now that's big!",7,6,22,25 April 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Fantasy art with a story
","Greetings again from the darkness.  This film has been analyzed enough, so I'll keep my comments brief.  Stunning locales, terrific acting, riveting action, deceit and love, Yo Yo Ma's heart-wrenching cello, and the finest dying scene in recent memory make this a must see.  Remember it is a fairy tale fantasy of mythical proportions.  It is not a documentary, so sit back and enjoy.  As most of us know, Chow Yun Fat has tremendous screen presence, and this picture is no exception.  My question is, when (PLEASE) will some Hollywood producer step up and allow Michelle Yeoh to become the major star she should be.  My tidbit on this one involves the beautiful (young) Ziyi Zhang.  She is cast with Jackie Chan in Rush Hour 2, due for release later in 2001.",9,0,0,15 January 2001
JFK," Mystery, Riddle, Enigma
","Greetings again from the darkness. Fifty years to the day after the tragic assassination of President Kennedy seems like the best time for me to finally write something about Oliver Stone's controversial 1991 film. As a Dallas resident, the hallmark event has never been far removed, either mentally or geographically. I periodically see movies at the Texas Theatre where Oswald was captured. It's impossible to drive downtown and not regularly pass the Texas School Book Depository and Dealey Plaza. The reminders are always present and maybe that's a good thing.When this movie was released, it shook the dust off the story and brought much attention back to the crime that had once seemed so quickly solved. The conspiracy theorists embraced Mr. Stone's work and even those who knew little of the Warren Report were swept up in the details and accusations. It was so easily accepted as an investigative presentation, and it was a way for the people to finally get what they wanted ... the answer to what happened and why.Viewing the film this week again for the first time since 1991, it's understandable why so many were swept up in the frenzy. This is an expert presentation of a staggering number of theories and details and characters. With a run time well over three hours, the only opportunities for an exhale come during the somewhat lame interactions between New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Sissy Spacek). Othewise, it's a very well written parade of movie stars that is exceptionally photographed and expertly edited. Newsreel footage, reenactments, and dramatizations of events successfully create a mind puzzle. The film grabs you and does not let go ... and this is 22 years after release and 50 years after the assassination.Now don't mistake that praise for believability. While Stone's approach has been attacked from all sides, he did publish an annotated script 'proving' his details. Still, his blending of theories is staggering: the military, the CIA, the FBI, LBJ, the Mafia, the pro- and anti-Castro types, the Russians, and even a likely corrupt businessman. The latter is Clay Shaw, played with evil enjoyment by Tommy Lee Jones in a role worthy of a movie unto itself.In Stone's version, Garrison is the voice of truth. He's the guy that doesn't buy off on the Warren Report. In fact, this movie version of Garrison represents us as the viewer ... the citizens who want to believe our government, but are too rational to accept things spoon fed to us. This isn't so much a courtroom drama or investigative report, it's more like a data dump. Stone is delivering all of the little doubts in one fell swoop. In other words, with all of these possibilities and unexplained events, how could it not be a conspiracy? Was it a coup d'etat with LBJ waiting in the wings? That makes sense if you believe defense contractors were unwilling to sit quietly as JFK pulled out of Vietnam. Was Oswald a patsy as he claimed? That argument can certainly be supported. More than one gunman? 5.6 seconds, a tree in the eye line, and smoke from the grassy knoll can lead to that conclusion. The movie serves as our emotional outburst at not knowing why this happened and who was responsible. We like our mysteries solved and this one apparently never will be.Roger Ebert once said that facts are for print and emotions are for film. Oliver Stone seems to excel at the latter. He gives us permission to be paranoid. He takes extreme dramatic license with two extended soliloquies: Donald Sutherland as 'X' (Fletcher Prouty) and Kevin Costner as Garrison in the courtroom. Neither of these events are probable, in fact the courtroom scene is borne from numerous Garrison speeches, quotes and book passages over the years.This 50th anniversary has brought at least three new JFK inspired films: Parkland, Killing Kennedy, and Letters To Jackie. Three very different approaches to the man and the event that changed the world ... it changed our perceptions and our expectations. Oliver Stone's film gave us permission to do so out loud.",7,2,9,22 November 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," QT9 - a Hollywood fairy tale
","Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled 'Bounty Law'. Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent 'Fosse/Verdon' or 'The Leftovers', and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder ('Lancer'). 90 year old Clu Gulager ('The Virginian', THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan ('Lancer'). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to 'catch' everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone.",8,561,938,25 July 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Mr Showmanship ... and Scott
","Greetings again from the darkness. According to director Steven Soderbergh, this is his farewell to film. He is taking his eye and camera and will concentrate on specialty projects ... at least until he figures out that movie directors make more money (yes, I'm skeptical). This one has been 'in the works' for years and is based on Scott Thorson's autobiography.If you don't recognize the name Scott Thorson, you surely recognize his opponent in his 1982 palimony suit ... Liberace. The story recounts how a 17 year old Scott fell under the spell of Mr Showmanship, and didn't leave until 1982. To understand what occurred during those years requires an understanding of the times. The gay culture had not worked its way into mainstream America. Despite his over-the-top flamboyance (on and off stage), Liberace's fans refused to believe he was gay ... or more accurately, refused to even entertain the idea.Although their actual ages are way out of whack for the story, Matt Damon and Michael Douglas are both exceptional as Scott and Liberace, respectively. Much of this story focuses on Scott, but Douglas' performance is what makes this work. He walks the fine line between predator and protector, lover and louse. When he tells a young Scott that he wants to be his 'Brother, Father, Lover, Friend', we are nauseated as viewers, while Scott is captivated.Supporting work comes from Dan Akyroyd as Seymour Heller, Liberace's fixer and handler; an exceptional Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon Dr. Startz; Scott Bakula as one of Scott's first and the one who introduces him to LL; Paul Reiser; Nicky Katt; and Debbie Reynolds ... yes THAT Debbie Reynolds ... who plays Liberace's controlling and creepy mother.Scott Thorson is really not a very interesting character, though there is no doubt that he and Liberace were exceptionally close for almost six years. The movies have shown us many 'kept' women over the years, so it's a twist to see a studly young man in the role. The slow spiral into drug addiction and paranoia is not fun to watch, and luckily the movie ends with Liberace's passing due to complications from AIDS. Since then, Mr. Thorson testified against gangster Eddie Nash in the Wonderland murders, and was placed in the Federal Witness Protection program. Of course, his taste of fame would not allow him to live a quiet life and he has since been shot and arrested ... even giving interviews from the Reno jail just one month before the premiere of this movie.Definitely worth watching thanks to the Michael Douglas performance, but also as a reminder of just how much innocence society has lost in the last thirty years. Soderbergh says that no studio would distribute the film because it was 'too gay'. Maybe we haven't progressed so much after all. Luckily HBO picked it up, though that prevents Douglas from being an Oscar contender. Brace yourself for the 'creep factor'. Liberace even tried to legally adopt Scott ... a move that eclipses the wildness of even his costumes, pianos and cars.",6,2,6,31 May 2013
Beasts of No Nation," Not like a baby, like an old man
","Greetings again from the darkness. Cary Joji Fukunaga has quickly established himself as an expert storyteller with his previous writing and directing of SIN NOMBRE (2009), JANE EYRE (2011) and the fascinating and conversation-sparking first season of 'True Detective' (he did not direct the much-maligned Season Two). He goes even deeper and darker this time by adapting Uzodinma Iweala's novel about a child soldier.When first we meet Agu, he is but an enterprising and fun-loving kid who thrives on mischief such as trying to sell 'Imagination TV' – the empty shell of a console TV, complete with Agu and his buddies acting out scenes for those who peer through the picture tube opening. Agu describes himself as 'a good boy from a good family', and we believe him.Somewhere in Africa is all we know about the location, and soon enough Agu's village is under siege and he is separated from his mother, and forced to stay behind with the men – including his father and big brother. More terror forces Agu alone into the forest until he is brought into a mostly young group of rebel forces led by the Commandant (Idris Elba). It's around this time that Agu begins 'talking' to God through voice over narration that allows viewers to understand what's going on inside Agu's head – often quite contrary to what is happening on the outside as he transforms from mischievous kid to dead-eyed child soldier. When Agu stops speaking to God, we understand that he believes he no longer deserves to be heard, but his words to the universe (directed to his mother) let us know, this boy has not yet lost his soul.Though we never understand the war, or even who is fighting whom, this uncertainty is designed to help us better relate to Agu. He may be a tough-minded soldier, but we also never forget that he is mostly a little boy hoping to re-connect with his mother. Idris Elba plays the Commandant as part father-figure, part war lord, and part cult leader. He is a menacing presence one moment and a soothing voice of reason the next. When we (and Agu) learn the full story of his multiple sides, we are both sickened and disheartened. It's the performances of both Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah (as Agu) that make this such a devastating and fascinating movie to watch, and it's the filmmaking of Fukunaga that keeps our eyes glued to the screen when we would just as soon turn away.",8,37,45,15 October 2015
Gone Girl," Trust Me in the Morning
","Greetings again from the darkness. One of the benefits of seeing so many movies is the ability to readily ascertain whether the appeal is to specific movie-goers (teens, romantics, et al), to mass audiences, or perhaps only to film critics and cinephiles. The downside is that when one of the rare mass appeal thrillers hits theatres, my enjoyment of the twists and surprises tends to suffer. Such is the case with director David Fincher's version of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel.Whether or not you are a devotee of Ms. Flynn's novel, you are likely to find guilty pleasure in this pulpy, neo-noir thriller featuring Ben Affleck as the man who may or may not have killed his missing wife (Rosamund Pike). This is less 'whodunit' and more 'did he do it?'. When Nick (Affleck) returns home to discover his wife (Pike) is missing, we hear Amy's voice guiding us through her journal as we go from blossoming romance to crumbling marriage. Nick's perspective is derived from his work with the detectives (Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit).This story-telling structure is beautifully executed, and when combined with director Fincher's fascination with the dark side of people (The Social Network, Zodiac, Se7en, Fight Club), and the terrific camera work and lighting elevate this from a technical filmmaking standpoint. Watch how Fincher uses lighting and shadows to change the tone of the film as the noose tightens on Affleck's character.Much has been made of the performances of Affleck and Pike, so I'd prefer to focus on a couple of others. Carrie Coon steals every scene as Nick's twin sister Margot. She is the moral compass of the film, and gives the absolute best performance. Kim Dickens provides the necessary screen presence and wry humor to prevent the stereotypical detective role from emerging. This is a real person working a complicated case. Also of note, is Missi Pyle's obnoxious Nancy Grace style TV reporter clearly attempting to build ratings by guiding the sheep. Lastly, and most surprising, Tyler Perry's slick and slimy headline-grabbing defense attorney provides a punch when the film needs it.The second half of the film transitions from mystery to anatomy of a scheme, and features one of the most brutal and bloody on screen murders you will ever see. It also provides more excellent support work from Lola Kirke and Brad Holbrook as a couple of trailer park opportunists, and Scoot McNairy and Neil Patrick Harris (against type) as Amy's former lovers.The wicked fun in this movie is derived mostly from the misdirection and personalities of Nick and Amy. It's nice to see a female lead character with some real scene-chewing, even though I believe many actresses would have been better picks. When I hear talk that it could be best movie of the year, I certainly hope that's off base. This one is at the level of other mainstream thrillers as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct, and it's not difficult to imagine Michael Douglas in the lead, were this 1988. Adding to the fun is the satire and social commentary ... especially on the current trend of media speculation. So enjoy the twists and ask yourself just how much you really know about your spouse.",7,1,25,5 October 2014
Django Unchained," Adult Supervision is Required
","Greetings again from the darkness. Well, after two viewings and endless analyzing, it's time to commit thoughts to the page. Over the years, it has become very clear that a Tarantino movie generates a first reaction, and then proceeds to slither through your mind and morph into something else entirely. It would be very easy to accept this latest as an outrageous peek at slavery disguised as a spaghetti western. For most filmmakers, that would be plenty. The 'whole' here is exceedingly impressive, but the real joy for cinephiles is in the bits and pieces.One need not be a Quentin Tarantino expert to enjoy his movies, but there are a couple of things that help. First, he is at heart, a true lover of cinema and quite the film historian, showing sincere respect to the pioneers of this art form. Second, he loves to bring visibility to issues (large and small) by poking a bit of fun at the evil doers who wield unnecessary influence and control over weaker parties. Morality, vengeance, revenge and come-uppance invariably play a role in his story-telling ... a bonus this time is the inclusion of the Brunhilde/Siegfried legend from Norse mythology and the Wagner operas.In his two most recent films, QT has been on a kick for revisionist history. Inglourious Basterds made a strong statement against the Nazi's, while this latest goes hard after slave owners. As you might expect, historical accuracy is less important to him than are the characters involved and tales they weave. And to that point, it seems quite obvious that where in the past, Tarantino would center his attention on crackling dialogue and searing one-liners, he now offers up much more complete characterizations ... these are people we understand, even if we don't much like them.The obvious love he has for Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Leone, the driving forces behind spaghetti westerns is plastered on the screen. We even get the beautiful camera work through the snow as a tribute to Corbucci's The Great Silence (1968). While this is not a remake or sequel or prequel, Franco Nero's 'I know' response to 'The D is silent' generates a laugh and memories of a 25 year old Nero in the titular role of 'Django' (1966). The Blaxploitation genre plays a significant role here as well since Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave who buddies up with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter, so that Django can get revenge on those responsible for the torture and mistreatment of his wife.The details of the stories will not be exposed here, however, I would encourage you to pay close attention to the moments of film brilliance. There is a running gag with townspeople and slaves alike struggling to accept the sight of Django on a horse. You'll laugh again when Django is offered the opportunity to pick out his own clothes and we see Foxx in a velvet Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit straight out of The Blue Boy painting from Gainsborough. There is hilarious banter between Big Daddy (Don Johnson) and Betina as he tries to give guidance on how to give Django a tour of the plantation.Some of the best moments occur when we recognize the actors in the vital foundation scenes. Don't miss: bad guy Bruce Dern, Don Stroud (the drummer in The Buddy Holly Story) as the sheriff, Tom Wopat (Dukes of Hazzard), father and daughter Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Jonah Hill who struggles with the eye holes in his 'bag', the eyes of Zoe Bell, Ted Neeley (Jesus Christ Superstar), 'Dexter' dad James Remar has two roles, Walton Goggins as a gunslinger, Michael Parks (multiple roles in Kill Bill and Grindhouse), and of course, Mr Tarantino himself (as an explosive cowpoke from down under).While each of these provide wonderful moments, it's the main performances of Jamie Foxx (Django), Christoph Waltz (Dr King Schultz, bounty hunter), Leonardo DiCaprio (Calvin Candie, plantation owner), and Samuel L Jackson (Stephen, Candyland house slave). Any combination of these characters in any scene could be considered a highlight. It's especially enjoyable to see DiCaprio cut loose after so many uptight characters recently. Samuel L Jackson has long been a Tarantino favorite, and his delivery as the diabolical Uncle Tom house slave who has some secrets of his own, will bring the house down when he first sees Django and, in a much different way, when his suspicions are confirmed. Power is big player in the story, and even as a slave, Stephen knows what to do with power when he has it. Mr. Waltz won an Oscar for his Inglourious Basterds performance, and his dialogue here is every bit as rich. It's obvious how much Tarantino enjoys hearing his words spoken by Waltz. Foxx' performance could be easily overlooked, but it's actually the guts of the film. He is quiet when necessary and bold when required.We must also discuss the soundtrack. Franco Migiacci's original 'Django' theme is featured, as are classics and a new song from the great Ennio Morricone. If you doubt the originality of the soundtrack, can you name another western that utilizes a mash-up of James Brown and Tupac Shakur? How about a spot-on use of Jim Croce's 'I've Got a Name'? The film is beautifully shot by Robert Richardson, and Fred Riskin takes over for Tarantino's long-time editor Sally Menke, who sadly passed away in 2010.It should also be noted that the script puts hip-hop to shame by using the 'N-word' more than 100 times. It is a bit disconcerting, and you can google Spike Lee's comments if you care to read more on the topic. Otherwise, dig in to the latest gem from Tarantino and appreciate his approach and genius ... either that, or stay away!",9,4,14,2 January 2013
Drive," A 5 Minute Window
","Greetings again from the darkness. An art-house crime drama. That's the best description I can come up with. Danish film auteur Nicolas Winding Refn takes the James Sallis novel and presents it like an art gallery opening ... with operatic tendencies ... and electronic music thumping straight out of the 80's. Confused yet? My apologies, but I am trying my best to make the point that this one is different. No wonder it got such a strong reception at Cannes, where creativity has always been rewarded.Ryan Gosling stars as the nameless driver. He is a movie stunt driver by day and hired lead foot in his spare time. He partners with hustler Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) for the odd-jobs and they both dream of going straight by entering the racing world. To do that, they need a capital infusion from bad guy Albert Brooks. Yep, I said BAD GUY Albert Brooks. We all know Mr. Brooks as the wry comedian who makes us laugh at the world. However, trust me when I say he plays a bad man. If you have seen 'Out of Sight', you have seen this side before. If not, you will be shocked.Gosling's character is quite the loner, but he falls for his neighbor played by Carey Mulligan, who also has a cute young son. Gosling's dream of normal include not only racing, but also a domestic home life with these two. Small obstacle: Mulligan's husband (Oscar Isaac) is getting out of prison in a week. When he arrives, Gosling agrees to help him square a debt with some bad guys. Things don't go so well and Gosling's dream of domestic bliss goes straight to Hades. Well, actually not all that straight.Somehow the bad guys run a double cross and things get really messy. The middle 60% of this movie is as intense and thrilling as you could ever ask. Some terrific driving stunts as you would expect, but also some very nice 'little' scenes as these most interesting characters try to make sense of many horrible loose ends.My mind was racing as I watched this oddly paced, minimal dialogue, intense story unfold. A few films flashed in my mind and I have decided there are elements of each: Bullitt (1968, Peter Yates), The Driver (1978 Walter Hill), Thief (1981 Michael Mann), To Live and Die in LA (1985 William Friedkin), and Heat (1995 Michael Mann). Additionally, Gosling's character shares some traits with Clint Eastwood's 'Man with No Name' trilogy. Now I am sure you are confused. How about one more: Gosling wears a jacket similar to Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike in Death Proof, only this one has a scorpion and sure enough, we get the scorpion and frog story.Gosling gives a very solid strong, silent type leading man performance, and Mulligan has very little to do. Albert Brooks will probably get some well deserved attention at Oscar time. There are a couple of scenes that more and make this one worth seeing. One is the fantastic chase scene after the pawn shop robbery and the other is the most beautiful and violent elevator scene ever filmed with mood lighting.This one will be loved or hated by those that see it. Hard to imagine it falling in the gray area. If you are up for a twist on the traditional approach to crime dramas, and can handle some brutal violence, I would encourage you to check it out.",8,1,10,16 September 2011
Aladdin," on a magic carpet ride, well
","Greetings again from the darkness. Aladdin ... come on down! You are the next participant in Disney's ongoing mission for live-action remakes of their classic films. And rest easy fans, this time the mega-studio has done right by the original. Now that doesn't mean there aren't surprises. How about Guy Ritchie as director? How about a cast of mostly unknowns? How about modernized songs and even a new one sung by Jasmine? And it probably goes without asking, but how about a lot of CGI?Mena Massoud ('Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan') stars as Aladdin, and he gets to showboat early in the film and flash some parkour skills in the familiar and high-octane chase through the village. Aladdin, of course, is labeled a 'street rat' and 'riff-raff', but he's also charming, handsome, talented as a thief, and quite warm-hearted. He and his pet monkey Abu - or more accurately, partner in crime - are streetwise and work quite well together, both for theft and love.Naomi Scott (slated to star in the CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie coming out later this year) is a beautiful and ambitious Princess Jasmine, who wants to succeed her father as Sultan of Agrabah, but is instead forced to choose between a steady stream of suitors - each a Prince, as required by law. Ms. Scott has a terrific singing voice and really gets to cut loose on the new woman power song 'Speechless'.The blue Genie is played by Will Smith, and this is what has fans of the beloved 1992 animated film so flustered. No, Will Smith is not Robin Williams, and few if any, could match the late great comedian for his energy and comedic flair. But Mr. Smith does a marvelous job of staying true to the original, while also adding his own style ... a style that works very well for comedy, music, and dramatic moments. He is not likely to disappoint anyone who has an open mind.So let's talk about the villain. Marwan Kenzari is Jafar, the man so dissatisfied with being number 2. Personally, I would have preferred a more intimidating bad guy, but given the tone of the film (more on that below), he's a solid fit. His sidekick and smart-aleck parrot Iago is voiced by Alan Tudyk (it was the distinctive Gilbert Gottfried in the 1992 version). Two other key supporting roles include Nasim Padrad ('Saturday Night Live') as Dalla, Jasmine's handmaiden; and Navid Negahban (Abu Nazir in 'Homeland') as the Sultan and Jasmine's father.It's been 27 years since Robin Williams' Genie entertained so many, and the comparisons to that version are inevitable. It's a relief that Disney opted to keep the film family friendly (Rated PG) and avoid the dark tone that had their recent projects aimed more at adults than kids, rather than the balance they've been known for more than 6 decades. Yes, this is the same director that made SNATCH (2000) and SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), neither of which any decent parent would allow their young kids to watch. But, Mr. Ritchie has delivered a film which entertained (and didn't overly frighten) kids as young as 5 in the screening I attended.Director Ritchie co-wrote the script with John August, who is best known for his work with Tim Burton (BIG FISH, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, CORPSE BRIDE, DARK SHADOWS, FRANKENWEENIE). The film runs 2 hours and 8 minutes, 38 longer than the 1992 film ... though it doesn't feel too long. Gemma Jackson's set design of Agrabah, the Palace, and the Cave of Wonders are all stunning, and then of course, there is the music. Alan Menken won an Oscar for ALADDIN (1992) and his music is back and modernized, and sounds wonderful ... especially 'A Whole New World' and Jasmine's new song.
With a talented cast of Arab/Middle Eastern/Central Asian/Southern Asian actors, there should be no cries of 'foul', and there really is something special about a movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed by all ages. The Bollywood-type closing number provides a kaleidoscope of color, texture and dancing ... and is a nice twist to 'You've Never Had a Friend Like Me'. And I'll leave you with this final offer: you can have the monkey, if I can have the magic carpet.",7,93,217,22 May 2019
Insidious," Behind the Red Door
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh, the lost art of horror films. I don't mean slasher films or gore-fests. I mean real horror films. The 'Saw' series falls into gore-fest and its collaborators, director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannel, team up again for a more traditional horror film ... one designed to scare the viewer, rather than just gross out society.The film opens as Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne move into a beautiful old house with their two young sons and infant daughter. By beautiful house, of course I mean terribly creepy with nooks and crannies, creaking floorboards, squeaky doors and an attic designed by Satan. The mom (Byrne) quickly realizes things aren't just right with this house, and as is customary in horror films, the dad finds some lame excuse to work late so the mom and kids can be haunted without him.There are some bits and pieces from classic horror films like 'The Exorcist', 'Poltergeist', 'Amityville Horror' and, yes, 'Saw' (but not the gory stuff). Remarkably, this film is rated PG-13 which means the filmmakers really have to tell a story ... and they do.The mom gets so desperate, she begs to move. They do. Guess what? Things aren't better. So mother-in-law Barbara Hershey says she knows someone. Next thing you know, two goof-balls that look like they should have their own cable show are in the house confirming something is definitely amiss. So they call in their boss. Unfortunately, the great Zelda Rubinstein (Poltergeist) passed away, so our expert is played by Lin Shayle. She does an effective job explaining astral projection and the next thing you know all hell has broken loose. Nice work lady.What makes the film work are the characters, the setting, the atmosphere and the really nice build-up of suspense and drama. Sure I think there were some details that could have been handled much better. For instance, the 'other' brother looks like he is going to be a factor, but instead all of the attention goes to Ty Simpkins as Dalton. Simpkins was seen recently with Russell Crowe in 'The Next 3 Days'. Also, more of the backstory with Hershey and Wilson's childhood could have proved very interesting.Still, I will say if you are a fan of horror films, this one is worth seeing. If nothing else, you will absolutely love the opening credits with their haunted images and smoky font. It's a bit of a fun challenge to find the 'image' in each of the opening sequences. Just make sure to finish your popcorn before the movie starts. That stuff is too expensive to be tossing across the aisle when you JUMP!!",6,3,6,9 April 2011
The Theory of Everything," Turning the Tide
","Greetings again from the darkness. Stephen Hawking would most certainly make anyone's list of the most fascinating people to have overcome severe obstacles in life to achieve greatness. Even today, at age 72, Hawking remains one of the foremost physicists and cosmologists. His extraordinary mind now 50+ years trapped inside a body that failed him, and as we learn, should have killed him by the time he was 23.Director James Marsh is known for his work on two documentaries: Project Nim, and Man On Wire. His flair with reality in those two films is mostly kept in check with this conventional biopic. Based on Jane Hawking's book 'Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen', the film does a nice job of showing us the stages of his motor neuron disease, while never digging too deep into the resulting hardships for Stephen or Jane (his wife).Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserable, My Week with Marilyn) delivers the type of performance that often results in awards. His physical contortions capture the Hawking we have all seen, yet he also emotes the charm and wry humor that accompanies his genius. Jane is played by Felicity Jones (so terrific in Like Crazy) and since it's based on her book, we are provided a glimpse into her strength and tenacity as she refuses to give up on Hawking or their relationship.Some basic science is touched upon here - mostly through beer foam on a table or the glowing embers from a fireplace, but it's highly recommended that you read Hawking's best selling book 'A Brief History of Time' if you have not already done so. It's written using language so clear and concise, that even I almost understood it! Much more than science, this film is about the tenacity of Jane and her ability to keep Stephen moving forward while still pursuing her own studies and raising their three kids.The evolution of their relationship is deftly handled, even as they each drift away towards others. When the break eventually occurs, it is the one moment in the film where heartfelt emotion is on full display. Oddly enough, it's more relief for both parties than disappointment. In light of the doctor's original estimate of two years to live, this moment is quite poignant.Excellent support work comes courtesy of David Thewlis as Hawking's professor and mentor, Emily Watson as Jane's mother, Simon McBurney as Stephen's dad, Charlie Cox as Jonathan (Jane's second husband), and Maxine Peake as Elaine (Stephen's second wife). Also of note, Harry Lloyd plays Stephen's classmate and friend Brian. Mr. Lloyd is the great, great, great grandson of Charles Dickens.You can see this one without being intimidated by the science, and instead get a glimpse at Hawking's challenges and the strength of Jane.",6,3,7,16 November 2014
The Number 23," Honey, You Aren't Helping
","Greetings again from the darkness. I was so looking forward to this. A nice cast, an intriguing premise and a director with something to prove. All the ingredients, but in the end we have no cake.Fascinating facts and creepy images and coincidences involving the number 23 are just skimmed over. Instead we are given what feels like 80% set-up and 20% explanation. What's missing? The guts of the story, that's what! The set-up drags on so long it actually becomes boring. There is so little suspense and so few thrills and so little drama, I am not even sure what to label the film ... other than disappointing.I usually enjoy Jim Carrey in his serious roles, you know ... 'The Truman Show' and 'The Majestic'. However, in this film he doesn't even seem like a real guy. Plus I couldn't help but think of 'Ace Ventura' when we first realize he works for animal control. This film is just too dark and bland to allow his charisma to come through. Virginia Madsen is stuck in another thankless role. Can't someone please cast this charming, talented lady in a real movie? Support work by Danny Huston, Ed Lauter, Rhona Mitra (ex-'Boston Legal) and don't miss Bob Zmuda in a brief role. Zmuda is Andy Kaufman's former sidekick.Really don't have much good to say about the execution of this one. Had high hopes and just feel let down. Not unusual for a Joel Schumacher film.",4,6,21,23 February 2007
Ghost Rider," Hunka' Burnin' Love
","Greetings again from the darkness. Film versions of comic book characters are usually either very well done or not worth watching. This is the odd one that falls somewhere in between. Any adult or older teen will probably consider it a big waste of time. Some younger kids (11-14) will undoubtedly find a hand full of 'cool' moments. Of course, overall it has very little entertainment value and is definitely not on the level of the Batman or Spider-Man series.Nicolas Cage, whose hair manages to look worse than ever ... it is actually a relief when his skull bursts into flames, is downright awful as motorcycle stunt rider Johnny Blaze who sells his soul to the devil. By looking at his career, Cage seems to want to be taken seriously as an actor while still playing like he is a kid. That attitude combined with a poor script and amateurish direction lead to mediocre messes like this. And enough with the Elvis obsession. Your impersonation stinks!Supporting work is provided by the eternally untalented Eva Mendes, who was probably not the first choice, but the only actress who would take this dead-end role. Wes Bentley (from 'American Beauty' fame) actually looks the part of the devil's son and Peter Fonda as the devil (nice to see him around motorcycles again) has little to do but tap his cane and let his eyes glow. Sam Elliott brings a touch of class to the story as the caretaker with a link to the 'mystery'.The director of this garbled project is Mark Steven Johnson, who also has 'Daredevil' to his credit. That should really tell you all you need to know about what to expect. This one scores as high as a 5 only because it will provide some enjoyment to a small age group of young boys who will think it cool when the head and bike are flaming. For even more torture, stay till the credits and listen to the worst ever version of 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' by Spiderbait. Definitely not Johnny Cash or Vaughn Monroe!",5,0,3,17 February 2007
The Lives of Others," It's For Me
","Greetings again from the darkness. This won the Best Foreign Film Oscar and deservedly so. A very gripping story with interesting characters and powerful, yet subtle performances.The three lead characters are each fascinating in such differing ways. Georg is a playwright/poet who does and says all the right things but ends up having his every move 'watched' because a powerful politician lusts after his girlfriend. Georg is played wonderfully by Sebastian Koch, who was also excellent in this years' 'Black Book' ... a must see for those who enjoyed this film.Georg's girlfriend, Christa, is played by Martina Gedeck (terrific in 2001 'Mostly Martha'). The subtleties of this performance can probably only be truly appreciated upon numerous viewings.The most interesting of all the characters is HGW, played convincingly and chillingly by Ulrich Muhe. A no-nonsense, black and white loyalist who slowly and ironically comes to appreciate life by spying on those who are a threat to liberty.This story is so complex, yet so easy to follow ... it is an example of brilliant writing and direction. These days when so many films strive for intelligence and fall short at the end, here is a film that actually gets better for 2 hours until an almost excruciating final 10 minutes and stunning final scene. Top notch film making.",9,1,3,27 May 2007
P.S. I Love You," Not So Heavy Thinking in My Fort
","Greetings again from the darkness. Richard LaGravenese is a very talented writer and director. His credits include 'Freedom Writers' (also with Hilary Swank), 'Paris, je t'aime', and the documentary 'A Decade Under the Influence' (about the impact of 70's films). He also wrote the terrific story for 'The Fisher King' (wrongly forgotten). Here he takes on Cecilia Ahern's novel and his first real chick flick.The premise for this one is very intriguing and with Gerard Butler (so great in '300') in a leading role, my expectations were pretty high. The good news is that Butler delivers the goods. He is remarkably charming and likable and proves to have a flair for quick wit and a boyish smile. Two other male actors deserve mention. Harry Connick, jr delivers his best performance since 'Little Man Tate'. Connick is usually so pompous on screen that he has become somewhat of a caricature. In the film, he is mildly afflicted with say-what-you're-thinking-aloud syndrome and has some of the best scenes in the film. Also, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (slow dying Denny from 'Grey's Anatomy') is pretty believable as Butler's oh-so-charming best friend and replacement.The bad news: for this film to work, we need to understand Butler's adoration of Hilary Swank. Maybe the best way for me to describe this is to say that Lisa Kudrow is not the most annoying woman in this film ... Hilary Swank is. Why did this great guy stick for 9 years with this ungrateful, narcissistic, loud, hateful, demeaning woman? Swank's character needed to be somewhat likable, not just aware that she loved him AFTER he's dead. The 'true love bond' was just not on display, so it just doesn't work.I score the film so high (6) only in deference to director LaGravenese, Mr. Butler, music from the Pogues and a chick flick premise that could and should have delivered. At least it offered my mind the opportunity to re-write scenes and recast the lead with someone who I wouldn't hope would get tossed off the roof.",5,8,17,1 January 2008
Room," Normal is not so easy
","Greetings again from the darkness. Tragically, stories of women being held captive have become all too common in this sometimes frightening world in which we live. Emma Donoghue had the high profile, real life situations of Jaycee Dugard, Elisabeth Fritzl and Amanda Berry (Ariel Castro) to draw from for her terrific novel upon which this film is based. While not easy for anyone (especially parents) to watch, it's a well made movie with outstanding performances  including a career-changer from Brie Larson.Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, a critical favorite from last year) takes us inside the world – or more accurately – the walls where Ma (Brie Larson) and her just turning 5 year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live. Seven years ago, Larson's character was abducted while walking home from school, and since then she has given birth to Jack, and the two have been held captive in a small shed with only a skylight connecting to the outer spaces of life. The captor  known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers)  periodically brings them supplies, while also regularly visiting to satisfy his more base needs with Ma.For the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time, we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the reports on real life ordeals.The second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world. We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen), her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to stomach than others.Providing any more details would soften the impact of the film, and this is one that is meant to be felt – even if it's a true kick in the gut. The film is well cast and well acted, and young Jacob Tremblay captures our hearts quickly and joins the short list of child actors who go far beyond 'cute' and into profound. Brie Larson exploded onto the acting scene in Short Term 12, one of my favorite movies of 2013; but it's here where she steps into the elite level of actresses. She brings a tenacity and emotional strength that leaves us never doubting whether she has 'her strong'.",7,4,15,23 October 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Zoned Out at Life
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes the line between reality and fantasy is blurred. In the moment, daydreams can feel like real life. Such is the existence of Walter Mitty, the milquetoast main character of James Thurber's 1939 'New Yorker' short story. This is no remake of Danny Kaye's 1947 movie, and thank goodness for that ... no one wants to see Ben Stiller singing and dancing. Mr. Stiller not only takes on the role of the zoned out Mitty, but he also directs (quite effectively).Walter is a quiet, photo lab geek at Life Magazine, the long time publication that is closing its doors. Of course, in real life, those doors closed years ago, but the magazine name makes for the perfect contradiction to Mitty's existence. The transition team is in place led by the snide, bearded corporate presence of Adam Scott. Photographer extraordinaire Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn) has delivered the perfect shot for the final cover. Only one problem: Walter has misplaced it.This gaffe leads Walter to cross paths with a co-worker played by Kristen Wiig, whom he has secretly admired both across the office and by staring at her eHarmony profile online. Their investigative work leads Walter on the first real journey of his life. He even breaks free of the family bond of his mom (Shirley MacLaine) and sister (Kathryn Hahn) and gets a pep talk and well timed boost from Patton Oswalt.Walter's expedition leads him to Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas, and Afghanistan by way of Yemen. He also encounters a wild helicopter pilot and ride, sharks, an erupting volcano, drinking beer from giant glass boots, a sad and aggressive Karoke singer, and takes a speedy ride via skateboard. Rather than changing Walter, these experiences just bring out a lust for life that was previously only flashed through his periods of fantasy zone outs.The acting is very strong in this one, and that comes from a guy who is not much of a Stiller fan. His beaten down demeanor and stone-faced expressions are spot on for the Mitty role. Ms. MacLaine, Ms. Hahn, Mr. Oswalt and Mr. Scott all add very nice comedic touches and Sean Penn captures the rugged fearlessness of a world weary photographer who recognizes the depth of Mitty.If you are a fan of Thurber's short story then you must know artistic license is taken to turn it in to full length feature. Screenwriter Steven Conrad provides Life magazine as a foundation, and some of the most beautiful places on earth during the journey. He even gives us a poetry falcon (my first) and a parody of Benjamin Button (a bit out of place). Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh delivers these locations to us in stunning fashion. The film is beautiful to look, and thanks to the score from Theodore Shapiro, it's complimented by well fitting music.This is one of those crowd-pleasing movies filled with sentimentality and charm. Critics will bash it, but most of us can relate to the underdog lead and his delusions of grandeur. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com",6,3,7,14 December 2013
Across the Universe," Love is All You Need
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have shied away from this movie for weeks presuming I would be disappointed. What a wonderful experience director Julie Taymor ('Frida') has created ... regardless if one is a Beatles fan or not. The music and visuals and stories are extraordinary and her vision comes through in that the parts create a whole.Jim Sturgess stars as Jude, a dock worker from Liverpool who sneaks into the U.S. and stumbles into Max (played energetically by Joe Anderson). As one might imagine, there is a scene where Max(well) is utilizing a silver hammer. There are so many small details and tributes throughout that I can't wait for the DVD to tell me what all I missed. Terrific, as always, is Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy. This amazing actress just turned 20 years old and is assembling a remarkable resume. Her talent is exceptional and was on full display in 'Thirteen' and has grown as she has matured. She has the ability to look angelic and soulfully wounded in the same film. This young lady will be fun to watch as her career continues. While Sturgess and Anderson are passable in their singing, Ms. Wood's singing here is top notch, especially 'If I Fell'.Also strong is Dana Fuchs as Sadie, a Janis Joplin like singer whose throaty voice and bourbon swilling are a hoot! Capping the support group are Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo (Hendrix tribute), Joe Cocker in a couple of roles recreating his 'Get by with a little help from my friends', Salma Hayak as multiple singing nurses, Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite and a hilarious Bono (yes THAT Bono) as Dr. Robert in a tribute to Ken Kesey and the electric Kool-Aid.There are too many cool moments to recap here and the film plays like unwrapping mounds of presents at Christmas. It offers a bit of 'Moulin Rouge', 'Jesus Christ Superstar' and 'Tommy', while staying true to the music and the unique vision of Ms. Taymor. There are numerous real life moments recognized in the anti-war stories. I loved the rooftop concert (as in the Beatles final public appearance) and mostly enjoyed the shots inside The Cavern Club in Liverpool where The Quarrymen got their start. Good stuff.",8,0,2,28 October 2007
The Lion King," next gen King
","Greetings again from the darkness. If you have come here to read yet another take on how this next-gen remake of a beloved film doesn't bring anything new to the story, you've come to the wrong place. I love cinema as an art form, and when analyzing a movie, I typically look for the good and enjoyable, rather than focusing on every element I might be able to criticize ... never forgetting that the on screen presentation is the culmination of work performed by many dedicated people so that I might sit back in a comfy seat within the confines of an air-conditioned theatre and be entertained for a couple of hours. And entertained I was.It only takes a few moments for the awe to set in. The look is at times so realistic that kids may actually believe animals can talk. More than once the fur of an animal or the splash of the river reminded of a National Geographic program with ultra-High Definition photography. So let's clear up something right now. This has been labeled as a 'live action' remake of the animated classic from 1994. You should know, even if your eyes tell you otherwise, that there is nothing 'live' in the film. Instead, everything you see on screen is computer-animated/generated. No, the lions and elephants aren't real and neither are the trees or distant mountains. The look of the film is as revolutionary as when the first TOY STORY stunned us in 1995. We had never seen animation like that then, and we've never before seen computer effects like this. What is familiar are two early songs, 'The Circle of Life' and 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'.Of course, neo-realism can be admired only as a technical achievement when we are discussing a movie in which lions talk and warthogs sing. So while we marvel at the technical achievement, let's not lose sight of the story ... what made the original so popular and beloved 25 years ago. Although it's approximately a half-hour longer than the original, this one is exceedingly close to a scene-for-scene remake. Only minor tweaks will be noticed, mostly in the demeanor of Scar and the banter between Pumbaa and Timon - each actually improving on the first film. What remains is the coming-of-age story that will now touch many new hearts and minds.Kids will be immediately entranced with the cubs, Simba and Nala, voiced by JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph (the daughter in Jordan Peele's US), and with Zazu (voiced by John Oliver), the goofy and comical bird tasked with keeping an eye on the two adventurous youngsters as they get themselves into trouble. James Earl Jones (now 88 years old) reprises his iconic voice role as the wise Mufasa, and Alfre Woodward voices Sarabi, the pride's leading female. Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent as the bitter Shakespearian villain Scar, but I couldn't help but wish Jeremy Irons had returned for this interpretation of the jealous and power-hungry brother of Mufasa.The energy level jumps once Simba meets Pumbaa the warthog and Timba the meerkat. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner take the comedy routine to a new place, and we can only assume much of their banter is off-script. Kids may not get every joke, but they are sure to respond to this odd couple. Donald Glover and Beyonce voice the grown Simba and Nala, and both are outstanding - especially with their singing (no surprise there). Nala's role is expanded a bit ... as expected when you cast Queen Bey. Her original song 'Spirit' is included but it's her duet with Glover on 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' that is a real musical standout.Director Jon Favreau has been in the chair for such hits as IRON MAN 2 (2010), IRON MAN (2008), and ELF (2003), and he was also behind Disney's live-action remake of THE JUNGLE BOOK (2016). The writing credits belong to Jeff Nathansan (CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, 2002) for the screenplay, Oscar winner Brenda Chapman (BRAVE, 2012) for the story, and Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton for the characters. The latter three were among the 28 writers credited for the 1994 version. Also back is composer Hans Zimmer, who won an Oscar for his 1994 score, and songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, also Oscar winners for their 1994 song, 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?'.The beloved 1994 version didn't win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature film because the award didn't exist until 2002; however, it did spawn the 1997 Broadway smash musical. This more realistic version is rightly rated PG rather than G, as some of the scenes are likely to be a bit intense for younger viewers. And it's important to remember that this version is meant to bring Simba's story to a whole new generation - it's not meant to replace the 1994 version for those who were kids when it came out so many years ago. The story and characters, while familiar to those age 30 and up, will be a whole new viewing experience for today's kids. So while we may prefer the 1994 animated version, kids today will likely be enthralled by this updated look. And we all better get used to it, because Disney has 18 more 'live action' remakes in the works (some of which will actually be 'live' action).",7,9,40,15 July 2019
The Incredibles," Totally Wicked, Pixar
","Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so I felt a little foolish walking into an animated feature without any kids. However, the embarrassment turned into fascination as soon as the short, 'Boundin'' started. Nice little parable to start the day. 'The Incredibles' is the latest offering from Pixar (and the director of 'The Iron Giant') and is bit like 'Toy Story' on steroids. Everyone from age 5 and up will enjoy this and some will be shocked at the realism, action sequences and drama of the story. Craig T. Nelson (TV's 'Coach' and the 'Poltergeist' dad) and Holly Hunter ('Thirteen' and 'The Piano') are the lead voices as Mr. Incredible and his wife, ElastiGirl. They are Superheroes forced into hiding and feeble attempts at normalcy with their kids, who were of course also blessed with superhero traits. The action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking and the mix of parental struggles, teen angst, sibling rivalry and hero worship make for a story strong enough to keep one's interest for 2 hours. Pixar continues to flirt with reality in their animation and we get the feeling that at anytime they will trick us with the blurred line between reality and fantasy. Samuel L Jackson and Jason Lee turn in nice voice acting, but little Dash pretty much steals every scene he is in. So, hold your head up high and go see this one. You don't even have to borrow any nieces or nephews!! Also, make sure to stay for the closing credits - they are a delight with the visuals and the score, which blends James Bond, The Avengers, The Pink Panther and Looney Toons all into one sound!",8,0,0,27 November 2004
The Mist," I've got plenty of Peas
","Greetings again from the darkness. With the greatness of 'Shawshank Redemption' on his resume, writer/director Frank Darabont's name will forever be associated with film greatness. Hooking up again with a Stephen King ('The Green Mile') story, Darabont takes aim at the monster/creature/sci-fi films of the 50's and 60's (think 'The Blob' not 'The Fog'). While this one has significant human nature editorializing, the actual frights are few and far between because mostly what we see are some stupid looking bugs that can be killed with a mop handle.The hero is Thomas Jane ('The Punisher') and a couple of his nemesis are played here by Andre Braugher ('Homicide') and a scene-chewing Marcia Gay Harden as the religious fanatic, who seizes her moment on the mountain top. Also joining in the food store fun is Laurie Holden, who spends most of the film taking care of Jane's wimpy son, William Sadler as a total buffoon, and Alexa Davalos (very good in 'Feast of Love') who demonstrates what the bugs are capable of.The two best performances are from Toby Jones ('Infamous') as the sharp tongued, sharp-shooting grocery clerk and the great Frances Sternhagen, whose character could make a fine little film unto herself. Of course, this film is not about the acting ... it is about the frightening monsters in the mist. Exploring the fear of the unknown, the effects of trauma and stress and expediency at which the religious fanatics seize on weakness. And yes, this is 2007, so there is a story line that bashes the military. I believe a similar type story line exists in 83% of films released this year.While not the best work from King or Darabont, it is a satisfactory monster movie that pretends to look deeper, but is actually pretty shallow.",6,3,9,24 November 2007
Stardust," Shop Boy, fetch me that Star
","Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to 'The Princess Bride' and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning Claire Danes. Not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our 'star' is wearing. Lots of bad chasing the good.Along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the Carribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn's ('Layer Cake') effort deserves an audience. Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. My guess it will find big success on video.",7,14,18,26 August 2007
Driven," Cars aren't the only thing crashing and burning
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Stallone proves again for the upteenth time that he is, and always will be, a one hit wonder.  He wrote one terrific screenplay 25 years ago, and has never recaptured the magic either on paper or on screen.  Yes he has made loads of money, but he has created no real piece of work since Rocky.  The Bad news is that Stallone may be the best thing in this sorry movie except for the spectacular race scenes.  I feel certain, Burt Reynolds is working the day after having the bandages removed from his most recent face-lift.  He looks like a horror film star IN FULL MAKE-UP.  Kip Pardue recreates his almost too pretty boy character from Remember the Titans.  Robert Sean Leonard continues his fall from the promise shown in Dead Poets Society.  Renny Harlin has directed exactly ONE watchable film - Die Hard 2 ... and he copied the first one for that success.  My only hope from this one is that newcomer Estella Warren moves on to roles that push her skills.  I don't know if Planet of the Apes will tell us much.  Bottom line is I found myself wishing one of the spectacular crashes would take out the camera, and we could all drive home!",4,1,2,30 April 2001
I Am Legend," Light Up the Darkness
","Greetings again from the darkness. Huge disappointment with no intelligence and only a modicum of style. Director Frances Lawrence has provided such previous gems as 'Constantine' and a Britney Spears video, so I probably had unrealistic expectations.Will Smith stars as Dr. Robert Neville who believes he is the last survivor and only hope for a cure of the massive virus that has either killed off or infected all of mankind. These aren't your father's zombies ... they have super strength, speed and agility ... and be careful (Mr. Neville) not to underestimate their aptitude.Really can't come up with much good to say here as the film is all over the place and doesn't provide much of a study of solitude or genius ... and even the clashes are pretty mild (but loud). Alice Braga (niece of the great Sonia Braga) has a key role, but even that is anti-climatic.There are many better zombie movies, numerous more creative special effects movies, and for better solitude, check out 'The Omega Man' or 'Cast Away'.",4,2,5,16 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," Run Away! Run Away!
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Bourne series has often been viewed as the American version of James Bond ... more serious and with more action. Doug Liman directed the first, which was taken directly from the Robert Ludlum novel. Paul Greengrass then assumed control over the next two and added hyper-kinetic speed to the action sequences and focused on the conspiracy theories, with a fascinating hero looking to take down a corrupt system. Involved in all three as a writer, Tony Gilroy takes over as director in this fourth entry. Unfortunately, the Bourne series is not similar to Bond, in that the directors and lead actors are not so easily replaced.With Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) present only on computer screens, Jeremy Renner takes over the lead as the next super-spy-weapon. When Pam Landy (Joan Allen) blows the lid off Treadstone in a Congressional hearing, the shady back office meetings lead to the decision to shut down the program. We all understand what that means ... destroy the assets and lose the records. This decision is made by Edward Norton and Stacy Keach, both new to the series.The decision leads to a vicious scene featuring the always dependable character actor Zeljko Ivanek who almost completes his assignment, but misses out on Rachel Weisz (playing Dr Marta Shearing). Dr. Shearing is involved in the manufacturing of the 'meds' that keep our super-spies and super strength and super intellect. Yes folks, our superheroes are roided-up! You have to hand it to Dr. Shearing - for a lab rat, she has a remarkable ability to stay alive despite being the target of many highly trained assassins. Of course, she does have a bit of help from Aaron Cross (Renner).Here is the real issue with the film. Instead of Bourne trying to bring down the corrupt system, this is really two hours of survival mode for Aaron Cross. It reminded me of the Monty Python bit as they face opposition on their castle storm 'Run Away!, Run Away!'. Most of the first half of the film is spent with him in search of meds, like any common drug addict, and the second half is spent on a motorcycle chase that goes on forever.As an action film, this one works just fine. The limited fighting and expanded chase scenes are well filmed and intense, it's just that as a viewer, it really isn't as much fun to cheer for someone who is running away as it is for someone (Bourne) looking to bring down a corrupt system. In addition to those I've mentioned, we get brief appearances from series' regulars Albert Finney, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, and Paddy Considine.The hope is that this is just a placeholder in the series. It's been five years since The Bourne Ultimatum, and hopefully, if the series continues, we will get Paul Greengrass back in the director's seat and Matt Damon teaming up with Jeremy Renner to wreak havoc on the true enemies of the state. Otherwise, the American Bond ends up as nothing more than an action film with no real purpose.",6,3,12,12 August 2012
22 Jump Street," Best/Worst Nightmare
","Greetings again from the darkness. In this day of 3 minute trailers that give away the best gags, if one can walk out of a comedy having laughed a few times, it must be deemed a success. Such is the case with this sequel to 21 Jump Street (2012), which was borne from the 1980's TV show of the same name.A couple of years ago, officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) went undercover at a high school to bring down drug dealers. This time, they head to a local college for the same purpose. If that sounds like a re-tread, at least the film acknowledges such. In a scene with Nick Offerman, a few minutes of self-parody are devoted to the mis-givings of re-do's ... even with double the budget! Co-directors (back from the first) make this film the butt of its own joke, and for the most part, that approach works.The best buddy comedies work because of two things: the script and the rapport of the leads. The pairing of Jonah and Tatum works very well, even when we get the predictable split into liberal arts and sports (take a stab which actor gets which assignment). There are a couple of actresses who play vital supporting roles - Amber Stevens as Schmidt's love interest, and Jillian Bell in an offbeat and quite funny take as the nemesis. Oddly enough, Jenko's relationship is a bro-mance on the football team with the QB played by Wyatt Russell (Kurt and Goldie's son). One of the poor decisions was to quadruple the screen time for Ice Cube ... his antics are funny in limited doses. Very limited.There are some terrific 'old man' jokes, as well as references to Maya Angelou and Tracy Morgan ... both who have been in the news for less-than-uplifting reasons lately. Most will find the best sequence to be after the movie ends and before the credits begin. The mock sequels (23 Jump Street, 24 ...) appear in rapid fire mode with a couple of cameos and some creative 'schools'. While the movie wobbles between spot on and over-the-top, it delivers what we expect ... a funny enough sequel to a funny enough tribute movie.",6,0,4,14 June 2014
School of Rock," Jumpin' Jack Black, It's a Gas, Gas, Gas
","Greetings again from the darkness.  With so few good comedies these days, it was pure joy to laugh out loud a few times during this Jack Black showcase. Is he over the top? Absolutely.  Is his humor and delivery similar to the great John Belushi?  Yes, down to the arching eyebrows.  And I say SO WHAT? Jack Black is hilarious in this movie and director Richard Linklater (the underappreciated gem 'Dazed and Confused') uses his spot-on observations of Rock music and school days to deliver a wonderful film going experience. Writer Mike White ('The Good Girl') also plays Black's wimpy friend and former bandmate.  Although his acting is fine, it is White's writing that will make him rich in Hollywood.  The kids in the band are wonderfully cast and appear to be very talented musically as well.  Special recognition to Joan Cusack, who just nails the role of the uptight private school principal who is just itching to be unleashed.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the Rock History tossed in for the sake of today's youngsters, but the tributes to Pete Townsend, Jimi Hendrix, Zeppelin and the Ramones are much appreciated.  Look for Nikki Katt in a brief role, but mostly just sit back and enjoy a pure comedy that truly ROCKS!!",8,77,84,7 October 2003
Kick-Ass," Kick-Ass. It most certainly does.
","Greetings again from the darkness. Just when you are convinced the comic book movie thing has been overdone, in swoops director Matthew Vaughn (the excellent 'Layer Cake') to reach an entirely new level through a unique, unconventional and twisted approach. It does't take but a few minutes to realize that clichés mixed with shocks will mess with your movie-processing mind! Somehow we are treated to teen angst,superhero-ism and most every human emotion and type between the two. WARNING: this movie is rated R and it is a strong R ... IT IS NOT FOR KIDS! The film slam-dances between ultra violence and uber-geekdom and satire driven slapstick. We get a 12 year old Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl, wielding weapons even more deadly than her shockingly adult tongue. Moretz was also a standout in last year's '500 Days of Summer'. We get her revenge-driven ex-clean cop Big Daddy father (Nicolas Cage) in Batman costume mentoring her to the ways of a world class assassin. I busted out laughing when I realized that Mr. Cage's voice mannerism mimic that of the great Adam West while donning the black cape. A very nice touch. Our other home grown, would be superheros are Aaron Johnson as Kick-ass (replete with green scuba suit) and McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as Red Mist. Most of these characters are one step removed from 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.Of course a comic book story must have a top notch villain and these days there are few better than Mark Strong. He delivers another terrific dead-pan performance as a drug lord and father to Red Mist. Strong's character is the driving force behind Big Daddy's quest for revenge.Aaron Johnson's Kick-ass is an example of the clunky teenager who has a good heart and is desperate for attention from the girls. He even accepts being labeled as gay by the hot chick he adores just so he can spend time with her. He hangs at the comic book store with his equally geeky friends and then 'transforms' into Kick-ass, a superhero with no powers other than a desire to do what's right and help those in need.Mark Millar's script balances many cultural and societal observations while delivering a visual parade of images and sounds (wondeful music and score ... including ELVIS) and moments that will keep the viewer unsettled. You might think it odd that an early scene lingers on a giant advertisement featuring Claudia Schiffer. Ms. Schiffer is married to the director and becomes one of many tributes and satires throughout the film. It is quite a different experience and one that not all will enjoy ... but it is to be admired for reaching for new levels.",7,2,10,17 April 2010
Call Me by Your Name," an artistic lustful romance
","Greetings again from the darkness. Although confusing the two is understandable, there is a difference between a story of romance and a story of love. That's not to say that the two can't overlap; in fact, they often do. In movies, romance is the dish most often served because it's usually more interesting. Watching the flirtatious dance and often awkward exploratory stage of what was once called the rituals of courting offers a writer, actor and director infinitely more possibilities than what we associate with the years of deep connection labeled as love. Andre Aciman's novel is adapted by James Ivory (of Merchant-Ivory fame, and 3 times Oscar nominated for Best Director) and the script leans heavily on romance ... lustful romance, to be specific.Director Luca Guadagnino (A BIGGER SPLASH, I AM LOVE) is an expert at making movies that engage our senses. His movies delicately tease us - they slowly absorb us into the emotions and feelings of the characters. Very few filmmakers have the skill to subtly seduce the viewer, and draw us into the story so that we are no longer merely observing. It's nuanced story-telling at the highest level. Elio's (Timothee Chalamet) family spends the summer at their estate in northern Italy. You've likely never met a more cultured family. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a renowned professor, his mother (Amira Casar) a recognized translator, and Elio himself is a musical prodigy who whiles away the days by transcribing classical music and reading every book he can get his hands on. Oh, he also flirts with the local girls because he is, after all, a 17 year old boy. His intelligence and corresponding wit is of a much older person, standing in stark contrast to his innocence and childlike maturity level with all other pieces of life's puzzle.Elio's world is rocked when his father's newest research assistant, Oliver (Armie Hammer), shows up. An 'Americano' who offsets his extreme politeness with an unrefined 'Later' when departing any encounter, Oliver explodes on the scene like a Greek God. He and Elio have an initial passive-aggressiveness towards each other as they test the boundaries for weakness, and more importantly, interest. Things move very slowly as the passion and curiosity brews during their bike rides, walks through the apricot orchards (forbidden fruit), swimming in every watering hole, and competitive banters on intellectual topics. There is a sensuality to most every scene, though those same scenes are filled with unspoken tension.The sunlit beauty as each summer day passes initially masks the emotions, and the stunning setting, people, colors, and music is accentuated by the camera work of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom. Nature is on display in its full glory; not just through trees, sunlight, and water, but in that elusive and unexplained connection between two people so strongly drawn to one another. Director Guadagnino's film easily slides into the romantic sub-genre of such films as BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, and CAROL, and the artistic approach provides a gentleness that even the peach scene can't undo. Michael Stuhlbarg (who seems to be everywhere these days) has an extraordinary father/son scene near the end which reminds us that each one of us has a story on how life may or may not have turned out as planned. The gut-wrenching pain with sharing that story usually means it remains untold; however, the invaluable lesson is not lost on Elio. First love and first heartbreak bring both emotional ecstasy and emotional devastation, and whether you believe the film's statement 'We have less to give each new person', you'll likely agree that the use of Psychedelic Furs 'Love My Way' is spot on.",7,3,10,20 December 2017
Gran Torino," You Don't Wanna Know
","Greetings again from the darkness. I was caught off guard by the political incorrectness and comedy and depth of Clint's latest. Say what you will, but this man has turned into one of the finest and most dependable filmmakers working. He is an expert director with a real feel for guiding the viewer.Now the hard part. What to say about his character, Walt Kowalski. Equal parts Archie Bunker, Dirty Harry and Buford Pusser. Walt spews racial epithets like a sports announcer spews superlatives. It will be very uncomfortable at first until you can adjust to his nasty temperament. But guess what? There is a heart of gold beneath the rugged body armour. Sure it stretches the boundary of believability at times and certainly his pet project, 'Toad', could have used a stronger actor or better character development. Still, there is quite a dose of social commentary on the developments occurring in neighborhoods across the country ... both racially and politically.Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torina bears a resemblance to its owner. A relic of the past that still has a bit to offer. A couple of my favorite scenes involve Clint and John Carroll Lynch (Fargo) in the barber shop. These guys go at each other hard and with no holds barred. It is laugh out loud guilty pleasure. Also, don't miss Clint's real life son (and the film's music director), Scott Eastwood, as Trey ... the anglo-tough-guy-wanna-be who gets humiliated by both a group of blacks and Walt.So while the viewer is expected to make a few leaps in understanding, and this is not perfection, it is in fact, still very good film making and worth watching. Supposedly this is Clint's final acting gig and I hope that's not true. Sure, the patented grunts and moans are a bit over the top, but the man can still carry a scene and a film. Either way, let's be thankful for his amazing ability to produce quality films.",8,2,7,27 December 2008
The Hurt Locker," Real Life Boomtown
","Greetings again from the darkness. Add another to the list of jobs I hope to never have ... Bomb Tech. Sure Keanu Reeves made it look like fun while drooling over Sandra Bullock, but here director Kathryn Bigelow shows us a closer look at what really goes on with these guys - deep inside the war.Jeremy Renner is stunning as the 'show no fear' bomb tech who understands his job, thrives on his job, and ultimately needs his job. Renner's talent was obvious when he played the sleazy rapist in North Country, but here you just can't take your eyes off of him.Bigelow (yes, the same who directed Keanu and Swayze in Point Break) delivers excruciatingly intense drama. There were times I wanted to look away, but I couldn't blink. I was frozen and glued to the action.Not many movies kill off the likes of Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes, but duty is the star of the film. And while that is the strength, it is also the film's weakness. Character development and story lines are pretty much non-existent other than the obvious thrill seeker, dedicated soldier, dumb white trash, etc. Those are more stereotypes than characters, but it doesn't prevent this from being a very intense film to watch.",8,2,5,6 September 2009
K-19: The Widowmaker," Decent Drama
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Missed this one during its theatrical run, so caught it on video.  Much better than expected submarine drama aided immensely by the real life facts and wonderful cast.  Director Kathryn Bigelow is quite the paradox.  Before this she had directed 2 terrible films ('Blue Steel' 'Point Break') and two interesting films ('Strange Days' 'The Weight of Water').  I guess right now she is one up!  By no means a classic, 'K-19' does hold one's attention and creates a bit of caring for a few characters.  Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson create the strength and empathy necessary for the leads, while rarely letting the script take them too far. Sub scenes are at times breathtaking and the sound can be deafening.  The fear of reactor failure is real, but not overdone.  Very watchable drama, even if it is not 'Das Boot'.",6,0,1,23 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Not your mother's Paris
","Greetings again from the darkness.  OK, take out your movie blender.  Start with a base of 'Fantasia', now add a dose of 'Tommy', a bit of 'Jesus Christ Superstar', a pinch of 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' and top it off with 'Shakespeare in Love'.  You get the idea.  This is a fun filmgoing experience that takes you for a wild ride and keeps your eyes moving all over the screen.  Some good performances ... Nicole Kidman really shines in a totally different role for her.  I get the idea they set out to make a cult classic.  Probably will not work because the teenagers aren't going to flock to it.  Maybe a touch overdirected, but still a must see.",8,0,2,9 June 2001
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Down Came the Rain
","Greetings again from the darkness. This follow-up to The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) seems to have the mission of throwing as much onto the screen as possible. There are not one, but three key villains, a teenage love story, a deathbed scene, numerous moments of soul-searching, a stream of wise cracks and puns, the most outrageous laboratory setting, a cartoonish evil doctor accent, the furrowed brow of Aunt Mary (Sally Field), flashbacks and video of the mysterious father, teasers for future movies, and of course, enough action and special effects to ward off any thoughts of peace.Personally, I find Andrew Garfield to be a nice fit as Spidey, but I just can't buy him as ultimate science geek Peter Parker. He bumbles about and bats his eyes too much for my tastes, and can't stand toe to toe with Gwen Stacy (real life squeeze Emma Stone) in scientific banter. Still, the original story is interesting enough that any minor issues are easily overlooked.At its core, this entry is a story of revenge. The foundation for Peter Parket's troubles all stem from Oscorp, so we are treated to some behind the facade sets that will keep viewers on their toes. After an initial face-off with bad guy Aleksei Sytsevich (a maniacal Paul Giamatti), we see the transformation of goofy Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) into the shocking (get it?) Electro. If that's not enough, childhood buddies Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) are reunited to set the stage for more good vs evil.The story would have benefited from more concentration on any of these three stories, while dropping one altogether. The viewer would have benefited from a slower jolt (one more!) in the transformation of Max to Electro. We needed to find the humanity, rather than just desperation. The same goes for Peter and Harry. The dots are a bit too far apart for connection, though DeHaan (so good in Lawless and Chronicle) is a striking contrast to the doe-eyed, beautifully coiffed Garfield.It's nice to see Stone's Gwen portrayed as a smart, ambitious young woman who also understands how demanding a relationship is, and the responsibility that goes with dating a superhero. Speaking of responsibility, the lack of Uncle Ben's influence here is disturbing, though probably necessary given the exploration of backstory on Peter's parents (Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz).When Paul Giamatti reappears near the end as Rhino, it's a bit difficult to not think 'enough is enough'. And oddly, this fight sequence ends abruptly, evidently setting the stage for future Spidey. And speaking of the future, the end credits scene plays as nothing more than a teaser trailer for the next X-Men movie, while robbing us of any details to the Sinister Six.Admittedly, I feel somewhat overdosed on Superhero and Comic book adaptations, yet the action and effects are still quite fun to watch, even if director Marc Webb (Ok, that pun is too easy) seems to jumble up too many story lines.",6,5,13,11 May 2014
La Grande Illusion," It's War, be a Gentleman
","Greetings again from the darkness. Often cited as one of the all-time great films, I was fortunate enough to catch this one again in a limited theatrical release ... a staggeringly beautiful and crisp print. The look of the film is so clear it looks new, and the updated subtitles make sense and are easy to read. As amazing as it looks, the real value is in the film itself.Directed by the great Jean Renoir, the story takes place during WWI and shows a much different viewpoint than what we would normally expect from a war movie. But then, this is not really a war movie ... or a POW movie ... or a Political statement. The real core of this story is the respect and gentlemanly nature exhibited by the men from opposing sides of the war. It is a reminder that war itself is the grand illusion. We also see the results of class differences. When German pilot von Rauffenstein shoots down a couple of French planes, he tells the recovery team to 'invite them to lunch' if they are officers. And then we see the similarities of the aristocratic officers as von Rauffenstein and Captain de Boeldieu discover their common bonds.The influence of this film is quite obvious in two scenes. The digging of the escape tunnel and subsequent emptying of pockets on the prison grounds were 'borrowed' in The Great Escape. Also, the singing of 'La Marseilles' to annoy the Germans was used quite effectively in Casablanca. We also see a quite daring bedside death scene with the pure admiration between opposing officers who decide dying in war is 'a good way out' for their types. Powerful stuff. There is also much commentary on differences: aristocrats, working class, Jewish, Germans, and career soldiers. We even see cross-dressing (with a purpose) in a couple of scenes, one of which provides an unforgettable visual as the soldiers sing 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary'.As great as the movie is, the backstory is almost as fascinating. Released as WWII was brewing, it was one of the first things Goebbels seized when the Germans took France. The original negative was shipped to Berlin and presumed destroyed. However, it ended up in Russian archives and was re-discovered in the 1990's. This was after Renoir attempted restoration from numerous copies in the 1960's. Unfortunately, he did not live to see this most recent restoration that brought the film back to it's original glory. Renoir's camera work is something to behold - subtle movements for extended shots. By the way, Jean Renoir is the son of the famous French Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. I believe they call that good genes.Silent film director Erich von Stroheim's iconic turn as von Rauffenstein is truly movie magic. You will recognize von Stroheim as the man servant in Sunset Boulevard. Boeldieu is played by Pierre Fresnay, Marechal is played by Jean Gabin, and Rosenthal by Marcel Dalio. Marechal and Rosenthal have a remarkable segment at Elsa's farm house. Elsa is played by the stunning Dita Parlo. This sequence provides a nice contrast to the POW portions of the film.This work of art is now 75 years old. It is highly recommended that you see it at least once. Also, check out Renoir's other masterpiece The Rules of the Game.",9,2,2,14 June 2012
The Illusionist," Make Us Disappear
","Greetings again from the darkness. The trailer and two male leads for this one made it a must see. What we get is an incredibly stylish, cool work of art ... and a decent (not great) film. Director Neil Burger, whom I know nothing about, has obviously studied Hitchcock and some of the great period pieces in Hollywood history. His lighting and shot selection are beautiful.What is missing here is a captivating, suspenseful story line. Really only two half-developed sub-plots exist. The first one is, will the Police Inspector (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti) 'catch' Eisenheim (a mesmerizing performance by Edward Norton) in the tricks of his illusions? The second, and much less interesting, is the odd love story between the long ago adolescent friends (Norton and Jessica Biel). This second story is borderline preposterous as we are supposed to believe some unbreakable bond occurred between these two at age 14 that even 15 years apart (and maturity and life lessons) could not break.Missing suspense aside, this is a very entertaining film thanks to the style of the film and the joy of watching two of our best working actors - Norton and Giamatti. We actually sense Norton's pain throughout and Giamatti again wreaks eternal resignation to his plight. Also adding to the fun is popcorn evil bad guy, The Crown Prince, played well enough by Jude Law lookalike Rufus Sewell. Luckily, Biel's contribution is limited to big hair, big lips, a big smile and very few lines of dialogue.The spiritualism of this era in Venice is touched upon, but actually very little historical significance is given to the Illusionists of the time, who were worshiped by the masses until they were exposed and then deposed.Definitely worth seeing, but disappointing due to its lack of story breadth and substance.",7,18,33,27 August 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Let's Go Surfing
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tim Story and the entire gang are back from the first film only this time the Silver Surfer adds a touch of class. The initial chase scene with Johnny Storm and the Surfer makes the film worth the price of admission.Yes, there is a bit too much relationship mush and scientific mumbo-jumbo, but this group was never meant to be an overly charismatic group except when they are saving the world. I will say, Jessica Alba seems a bit more annoying this time around, both in her fake tan looks and her whiny-bride act. Still, it is fun when they go into full 'fantastic' mode.Laurence Fishburne is the voice of the Silver Surfer and all scenes involving this fascinating character are a bit more exciting than the rest. Ion Gruffudd, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis fill out the rest of the FOUR, and Julian McMahon is back from the dead as Victor Von Doom. It is set up for yet another sequel, and who can blame them as long as there is an interest from the fans. Don't expect classic film-making, just go for the light hearted fun and special effects.",6,6,12,17 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," What's Coming for You
","Greetings again from the darkness. No doubt headed into this one with inflated expectations of greatness. While the basic theme fascinates me, the execution of the storyline just didn't quite keep my interest. Mostly I just kept asking why. Why do so few people realize what is happening? Why is BB attracted to Cate Blanchett's character (most guys would have run away)? Why is Cate's character attracted to BB (he seems quite dull)? David Fincher is a stud director with a resume that includes Zodiac, Fight Club and Seven. He seems to do what he can with Eric Roth's adaptation of Fitzgerald's short story ... I just felt it needed more detail and more happenings. Our only real glimpse of BB's travels are on the tug boat and those are probably the highlight of the film, next to the uniqueness of the make-up and special effects. Contrast this to the far superior Forrest Gump, also penned by Mr. Roth.Brad Pitt plays the role in a disarmingly quiet mode, while Cate Blanchett and Tarij P Henson go overboard. The New Orleans setting and other set design were outstanding. The flashback scene from the hospital death bed is given a nice twist with Katrina bearing down. Seems to be a movie many would enjoy, I had just hoped for a bit more.",7,5,10,27 December 2008
Pawn Sacrifice," Is it Paranoia if they are after you?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Being such a fan of the expert documentary film BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD (2011), I found it a bit challenging to clear my head and accept a dramatized approach to the story. This was after all, one of the most fascinating reluctant public figure during one of the most energizing signature events of the Cold War between Russia and the United States  it was even described as World War III on a chess board.Director Edward Zwick (Glory, Blood Diamond) and writer Steven Knight (Locke, 'Peaky Blinders') wisely focus the story on the infamous World Chess Championship match in 1972 between American Bobby Fischer and Russian Boris Spassky. This was 8 years prior to the 'Miracle on Ice' when the USA Olympic hockey team upset the powerhouse Russian hockey team, but this chess match caused every bit as much media frenzy and national pride as that day in Lake Placid. This international attention is as important to the story as the psychological state of Bobby Fischer and his genius-level chess skill. And it's the media and citizenry reactions that provide the contemporary comparison to what we see too often these days thanks to social media  icons are born, chewed up, and forgotten.Tobey Maguire plays Fischer, and despite lacking the height and physical presence of the real chess champion, he expertly conveys the paranoia, fear, and arrogance that burdened the man and created even more suspense for those of us keeping a watchful eye at the time. Liev Schreiber ('Ray Donovan') plays Boris Spassky, and even speaks his lines in Russian. Schreiber captures the iciness for which the Russians were known, but also interjects subtle personality and insight in a story where his adversary is constantly over-the-top. Chess strategy isn't so much the story here, as are these two men from different worlds forced together on a stage in Iceland – with the full attention of the world.Supporting work is varied, but exceptionally strong. Robin Weigert plays Bobby's mother, and we get glimpses of why he later suffered from Mommy issues – in no small part to her intimate gatherings of Communist friends. Lily Rabe is touching as Bobby's sister and possibly the only person who ever had his best interest at heart. However, the real intrigue comes in the form of Peter Sarsgaard as Father Bill Lombardy, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Paul Marshall. Lombardy was Fischer's coach and confidant, and seemed to be the only one who grasped the severity of Bobby's mental state. Marshall, a well known attorney in the Music industry, is a shady fellow who seems connected to the government, and is really the driving force behind getting Fischer to play Spassky. More background and the motivation for these two gentlemen would have been welcome and filled a gap.The story of the tortured genius always makes entertaining fodder – think Van Gogh, Mozart, and John Nash. Bobby Fischer certainly fits that description, but his story is frustrating because we just don't understand the mental issues that caused him to evolve from teenage chess prodigy to World Champion to literal anti-social outcast spewing hateful words (watch the end credit film clips). This film is a worthy primer for the man and the times, and a reminder that we are always searching for the next hero  the next person to hoist up on the pedestal, only to be replaced soon after with another, and then another. Perhaps the film says as much as about us as a people, as it does about Bobby Fischer as a person.",7,14,29,17 September 2015
Hidden Figures," Another story that needs to be told
","Greetings again from the darkness. The space program has created many iconic images over the years: rhesus monkeys in space suits, the Mercury 7 Astronauts press conference, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin erecting a flag on the moon, and numerous Space Shuttle missions – some successful, others quite tragic. We've even been privy to cameras inside the space station and the NASA control center. Despite all of that, director Theodore Melfi's (St Vincent, 2014) latest film uncovers a part of history to which most of us knew nothing of.Adapted from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film stuns us with the story of the 'Colored Computers'  the African-American female mathematicians who manually checked and cross-checked the endless calculations, formulas and theories required to launch a rocket into space and bring it (and the astronaut) back home. It's a crowd-pleasing history lesson and an overdue tribute to, and celebration of, three intelligent women of color who played crucial roles in the success of the American space program We first meet a young Katherine Johnson as a child math prodigy whose school can't provide her the challenge she needs. Next we see her as a bespectacled adult (Taraji P Henson) on the side of the road beside a broken down car with her friends and co-workers Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (musician Janelle Monea). They are on their way to work at Langley in the computing department. Dorothy is the ad hoc supervisor of the group and is in a non-stop battle for the title and increased pay that comes with the job. Mary is the razor-tongued one who is striving to overcome all of the obstacles on her way to becoming the first female African American Engineer at NASA. These are good friends and smart women caught up in the racism and sexism of the times and of the organization for which they work.Soon, Katherine is promoted to the Space Task Group run by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). This is a group of true rocket scientists, and Katherine is charged with checking and confirming their work  a thankless job for anyone, but especially for a black woman in the early 1960's. Her supervisor (Jim Parsons) refuses to give her the necessary security clearance – huge portions of the work are redacted, making it increasingly difficult for Katherine to run the numbers. This is a seemingly accurate and grounded portrayal of racism in the workplace. At the time, racism and sexism were mostly woven into the fabric of society  it's 'just the way things are'. It's almost a passive-aggressive environment with separate coffee pots and restrooms clear across campus.There are numerous sub-plots – probably too many. We even get an underdeveloped romance between Katherine and a soldier named Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali, so great in this year's Moonlight). We follow Mary as she goes to court in pursuit of the right to attend the college that offers the engineering courses required for her certification. We see Dorothy with her kids, as well as her ongoing head-butting with her condescending supervisor (Kristen Dunst), who claims to have nothing against 'you people'. Dorothy's response is clever, crowd-pleasing and a reminder that this is an air-brushed version of reality  but also a view that we rarely see. As the Mercury Project progresses, we see how Harrison (Costner) is so focused on getting the job done, that he is oblivious to the extra challenges faced by Katherine – that is until her emotions erupt in a scene that will have Henson under Oscar consideration.The slow implementation of the first IBM mainframe is important not just to NASA, but also to Dorothy and her team. They see the future and immediately start self-training on Fortran so that they are positioned for the new world, rather than being left behind. Eye-opening sequences like this are contrasted with slick mainstream aspects like no slide-rules (not very camera friendly, I guess), stylish and expensive clothing for the underpaid women, and a steady parade of sparkling classic cars in vibrant colors – no mud or dents in sight. Sure, these are minor qualms, but it's these types of details that distract from the important stories and messages.The film does a nice job of capturing the national pride inspired by the Mercury project, and astronauts such as John Glenn (played here by Glen Powell, Everybody Wants Some!!). It even works in some actual clips and captures the pressure brought on by the race to space versus the Russians. There is an interesting blend of Hans Zimmer's score and the music of Pharrell Williams that gives the film a somewhat contemporary feel despite being firmly planted in the 60's. This mostly unknown story of these women is clearly about heroes fighting the daily battles while maintaining exemplary self-control. It offers a positive, upbeat and inspirational message  believe in yourself, and don't pre-judge others. Don't miss the photos over the closing credits, and don't hesitate to take the family to the theatre over the holidays.",7,20,62,26 December 2016
Coco," yet another Pixar instant classic
","Greetings again from the darkness. Despite my two-decades long worshipping at the animated alter of Pixar, the trailer for this one just never struck a chord with me. Thank goodness there was a late night showing aboard my recent Disney cruise, or I might still not have caught this gem that ranks among Pixar's best ... and this is the studio that has gifted us the TOY STORY franchise, THE INCREDIBLES, UP, and INSIDE OUT - instant classics, each and every one.Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina team up as co-writers and co-directors for the 19th feature film from Pixar Studios. It's the second Pixar film this year (CARS 3), but the first original (non-sequel) since 2015 (THE GOOD DINOSAUR, INSIDE OUT). This latest not only offers the most advanced visuals to date, it also features a complex story that touches on numerous topics: Mexican culture, family legacy, religious traditions, loyalty, following one's own path, respect for the elderly, and remembrance of those deceased. If all of that sounds a bit too heavy-handed and deep for kids, keep in mind that Pixar charmed us with UP, the story of a man whose wife dies - yet, they kept us laughing with one word ...'squirrel!'The story focuses on young Miguel and his desire to sing and play guitar despite his long-standing family ban on music. Miguel is convinced he is related to the most famous Mexican performer in history, Ernesto de la Cruz, and he concocts a plan that corresponds to Dia de Muertos to convince his family that he must be allowed to play music. The film is respectful to this tradition as the living pay tribute to those who have passed. The deceased are invited back for this one night with beautiful flowers guiding them from the Land of the Dead to that of the living.Miguel's adventure is quite a wild ride as he navigates the path between the living and the dead. Somehow the film is even a visual step up from the colorful beauty of UP and INSIDE OUT, with the city and the unique flying creature being exceptionally stunning. The Pixar charm and personality are evident throughout - even in Dante, the ever-present dog. Many Mexican celebrities and historical figures (including Frida Kahlo) are noted, but at its core, this is the story of a boy pursuing his dream, no matter the obstacles.Pixar fans will be relieved to know that the Pizza Planet truck makes an appearance, as does A113, and numerous other Easter eggs. John Ratzenberger keeps his Pixar streak alive, and though Anthony Gonzalez (Miguel), Gael Garcia Bernal (Hector) and Benjamin Bratt (Ernesto de la Cruz) all do fine work, this one is not so much about the voice acting as it is about the tremendous story and art work. Remarkably, Pixar has done it again ... an animated masterpiece that is among its finest yet. Parents should note that the film is rated PG, rather than G. There are talking skeletons and a couple of scenes that could frighten young kids.",8,1,5,27 December 2017
1917," hold on tight
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's now been over 100 years since World War I ended. The Great War garners barely a mention in high school history books these days, and Hollywood has devoted much more time and energy to WWII. Filmmaker Peter Jackson did his part with last year's stunning documentary THEY SHALL NOT GROW OLD, a video and photographic look at the actual people involved in the First World War. And now, Oscar winning director Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY) delivers another glimpse ... and another technical marvel.Mr. Mendes, working with Oscar winning Cinematographer Roger Deakins (BLADE RUNNER 2049) and Oscar winning Film Editor Lee Smith (DUNKIRK), has shot and edited the film to give the look of one continuous take in real time. Although used previously in such films as Hitchcock's ROPE and Inarritu's BIRDMAN, the single take approach is certainly no gimmick here. We open on two young British soldiers lounging in a prairie as they are summoned to report to the commander. Their mission is described as critical, as a British battalion is preparing to walk into a deadly trap set by the Germans. More than 1600 lives are at stake and the phone lines are down. It's up to Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield to work their way across No Man's Land to the front line and hand-deliver an order stopping the attack. Oh, and one more detail: Blake's older brother is in the battalion he is tasked with warning.The real time approach serves the purpose of allowing viewers to take on the urgency of Blake and Schofield. We experience the tension and horrors of war. Barbed wire, booby traps, slushy trenches, snipers, rats, dead bodies, dogfights (the aerial type) and towns under siege all play a part here as the men rush towards their goal of saving fellow soldiers lives, including a beloved family member. Dean-Charles Chapman ('Game of Thrones') plays Blake, and George MacKay (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC) plays Schofield. We spot the personality differences between them. Blake is super focused and determined to save his brother, while Schofield doesn't welcome the assignment, but is a dutiful soldier and loyal friend.It's really the Schofield character with whom the viewer mostly relates. He's no super soldier or Jason Bourne-type, but rather a young man trying to stay alive and fulfill his orders. With the relentless pacing of the film, we feel the fear and admire the courage. There is an especially touching scene in a bombed-out town where paths are crossed with a French woman (Claire Duburcq) caring for an orphaned infant. It's a reminder that humanity still exists, even within the bounds of war.There is no clock ticking in the corner of the screen, but we know time is of the essence, and quite limited. The camera seems to be always moving forward, rarely allowing for us or the characters to exhale. As you might expect, running is done frequently - sometimes towards something, sometimes from it. Roger Deakins is in prime form here with his camera, and there are too many remarkable moments to mention them all; however, the river rapids and waterfall, and the town under siege at night, are two of the most incredible sequences I've seen on screen.Along the journey, some familiar faces pop up as military men: Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth. Although each appears only briefly, it's a testament to their acting prowess that each is memorable. The chaos and relentless terror of war is on display, more often than not. But this isn't a film designed to create deep thoughts or serious debates on the merits of war. Instead, it's meant to focus on one of the countless personal stories that occur during war. War is fought by people, not faceless countries, and each person has their own story.Non-linear story telling has been a movie-thing since even before MEMENTO, but director Mendes (and co-writer Kristy Wilson-Cairns, 'Penny Dreadful') show us the true presentation of linear ... in the moment and by the moment. GALLIPOLI and PATHS OF GLORY are about the closest comparisons I can come up with, and the weight of the film is felt physically and emotionally as we are drawn in. The exceptional score from Thomas Newman (14 time Oscar nominee) serves to accentuate the chaos and relentless terror. It's a work of art and a unique viewing experience.",8,12,21,23 December 2019
Lincoln," Equally Before the Law
","Greetings again from the darkness. The movie lover in me has been anxiously awaiting this one for months. On the other hand, as a citizen, the recent Presidential campaign antics put me in quite the political funk. Tired of the rhetoric and disenchanted with the current leadership, I was concerned my thoughts might poison the outlook on director Steven Spielberg's latest. Fortunately, both Lincoln and 'Lincoln' allowed me to forget those in charge today, and instead witness the look and feel of true leadership and greatness.Despite the title, this is not simply a biographical sketch of our 16th President. Rather, it's an essay on back room politics ... the key to Washington and democracy. Deal-cutting, horse-trading, arm-twisting are just some of the strategies involved in reaching compromise. When the stakes are history ... abolishing slavery ... the passion of those unseen actions is intensified. We see a man at the height of his power willing to do what is necessary to reach a goal in which he fervently believes - even though his views are not shared by a great many others.Some of the most fun in the film occurs during the House floor debates between Republicans and Democrats. These scenes serve as a reminder that the two parties are often at philosophical odds and, just as designed, debate and discussion lead to compromise and advancement. At least that's the general idea and purpose. Next to Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, err, embodiment of Lincoln, the script is what really jumped out at me. Loosely based on 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln' by Doris Kearns Goodwin, Tony Kushner's screenplay serves up dialogue that is sharp, crisp, entertaining, thought-provoking and filled with message. This is a very talky film, not a Civil War film. We only get a couple of brief battlefield scenes, but the conversations never allow us to forget that the brutal war is always on the mind of the politicians and citizens.Having always been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln, and familiar with the legend, the icon, the monuments, the statues, it was with true awe that I recognize what Daniel Day-Lewis delivers. His presence is so powerful that I found it all but impossible to look at anything else when he was on screen. That will certainly mandate a second viewing, but I have no hesitancy in recommending a film that brings to life what a great man can be ... what true leadership can be. This is a man who carries his burdens in his soul. He may have been self-educated, but in addition to Shakespeare and Euclid, Mr. Lincoln understood people. That knowledge allowed him to maintain his high principles through patience and reasoning and even (sometimes) humorous story-telling.We are never allowed to forget that this is a Spielberg movie. The scenes with Lincoln and Mary Todd (Sally Field) are somewhat distracting to the greater stories, but perhaps that's the point. These discussions were distractions to him as well. In fact, Spielberg is quite kind to Mary Todd Lincoln. Other tales have not been. Either way, Ms. Field is effective, though I wish she had less screen time.The supporting cast is a who's who of character actors. Most won't be named here but Tommy Lee Jones is a key player as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, a radical abolitionist; David Strathairn as Sec of State William Steward has Lincoln's trust; Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Lincoln's son; and Jackie Earle Haley plays the Confederate VP Alexander Stevens. There is also a tribunal of political lobbyists or fixers that add quite the element of dirty-politics: James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson. There is a quick scene at Appomattox showing General Robert E Lee, and we get a couple of scenes with General Ulysses S Grant (Jared Harris).Lastly, the score from the great John Williams excels and compliments the mood and pace of the story ... he is careful to never overwhelm. Williams is probably in line for his 48th Oscar nomination (second only to Walt Disney). This is a film about process and the people who made that process work - even at a time when everyone thought the choice had to be made between ending the war and abolishing slavery. Choose one, you can't have both. Abraham Lincoln proved that sometimes the right man is in the right place at the right time. Unfortunately, those times come around very rarely.

Sing Street," London Calling
","Greetings again from the darkness. The vast majority of 1980's music usually inspires nothing but groans and an immediate change of the radio channel from me. Yet writer/director John Carney masterfully captured and held my attention with this crowd-pleasing story that leans heavily on the tunes from that era.Mr. Carney was also responsible for two previous music-centric movies, Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). He is an exceptional story teller who puts music at the center, but avoids the label of 'musical' by making it about people, rather than notes.It's 1985 in economically depressed Dublin, and a strong opening sequence introduces us to Connor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) as his ever-arguing parents (Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy) inform him of the economic necessity of pulling him out of prep school and enrolling him into a much tougher environment Â… one that comes with bullies and hard-nosed teachers/clergy.Soon enough Connor is hanging with the misfits and inviting an enchanting 'older' girl to star in his band's video. She agrees, and wide-eyed Connor quickly sets out to form a band that didn't previously exist.There are two interesting and fully realized relationships that make this movie click: Connor and the enchanting Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and Connor and his older brother Brendon (Jack Reynor). Brendan is Connor's life mentor and music guru. They are quick to jump on the new world of music videos, and it's a real hoot to watch Connor emulate the style and fashion of Duran, Duran, The Cure, etc.It's fascinating to note that Connor, while a pretty talented lyricist and singer, doesn't really seem to be in love with the music except as a means to an end Â… a way to get the girl. That said, the real message here is that while teenagers often feel like they can't fix the outside world (parents, teachers, bullies), they can fix themselves by finding a passion in life (the movie uses the term vocation).It's hard not to notice the influence of such filmmakers as John Hughes and Cameron Crowe, and Carney certainly brings his touch of romanticism. Plus, one must appreciate any movie that delivers an original song as catchy as 'Drive it like you Stole it', while also taking a shot at Phil Collins. It's a funny and sweet movie that should really catch on through positive word of mouth.",8,30,48,20 April 2016
Children of Men," Strawberries, Bazooka and King Crimson
","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on P.D. James' novel, stud-director Alfonso Cuaron (Y tu mama tambien, last Harry Potter movie) delivers a stunningly bleak and intense version of the future and the human fight for survival.If you have seen the preview or read the book, you know the premise. Claire-Hope Ashitey plays Kee, the first woman to get pregnant in almost two decades. With non-stop warring between multiple factions (that we never quite understand), a smaller though equally intense battle is on to save and control Kee's new baby. Getting involved with the mission are Julianne Moore, Clive Owen, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Owen and Moore are former spouses who lost their kid and Ejiofor has ulterior motives.Caine is a hoot as Owen's friend and guru and Owen himself probably offers up his best film performance to date. Make no mistake, this is a bleak and extremely intense chase movie. Mother-to-be Kee is a bit 'wicked', but we can't help but root for her to make it through to the good guys ... the mysterious 'Human Project'. Yes, I know all of this sounds a bit ridiculous, but it is such a well crafted movie and story that it somehow not only works, but sucks you in. Also take note of the excellent use of current events and music to make points and counterpoints regarding political issues. Kinda cool.",8,8,14,30 December 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Lemon Pie and Yeats
","Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise this gem of a film is! I had to force myself to go after the nominations because the trailer was SO BAD. Hilary Swank is totally believable as the trailer park trash dreamer who wants so much to be a professional boxer. The great Morgan Freeman brings elegance to his role as a former boxer / now wise janitor and Clint's gym. Freeman again proves he is the best movie voice over working today (see 'Shawshank Redemption'). As wonderful as Hilary and Morgan are, there is no doubt that this is Clint's (multi) million dollar baby. He directs and stars and writes the music. At almost 75 years old, he can still carry a picture, while not stealing scenes. Yes, the twist in this one smells a bit like a Hollywood chick-flick, but the talented director (Eastwood) never lets it sink to that level. This is a terrific film by a top-notch filmmaker. The story is interesting, funny, dramatic and heart-warming and the acting is truly first rate. Don't let the trailer or the thought of a boxing movie keep you away.",9,6,9,25 January 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," The Pumpkin King
","Greetings again from the darkness. Somehow it's been a full 20 years since this groundbreaking film was released. It's a rare combination of cult and holiday, and even all these years later, it's incredibly entertaining. It shouldn't surprise anyone that the lead character is a societal misfit who means well. After all, the story is based on a Tim Burton poem.While watching the film, what strikes me is that this was a totally unique and creative world designed by Burton and director Henry Selick. Mr. Selick is a stop-motion expert known also for Coraline (Oscar nominated) and James and the Giant Peach. Complimenting the fantastical look and characters are the witty songs penned by Danny Elfman. Mr. Elfman is now one of the most prolific and successful composers working in the movie industry. At the time, he was better known as the front man for the party band Oingo Boingo (his Batman score changed that!).Since Pixar took over the animated world, we have come to expect major stars as voice actors. In Halloween Town, we instead get Danny Elfman (singing) and Chris Sarandon (speaking) teaming up for Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Catherine O'Hara is effective as Sally, Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman) stands out as Lock (of Lock, Shock and Barrel). The two most outstanding voice performances come from the late William Hickey as Dr Finkelstein (mad scientist), and Broadway star Ken Page as bad guy (and worm-infested) Oogie Boogie.There has been debate on whether this is best served as a Halloween movie or Christmas movie. The desire and hope to bring positive change to the world seems to fit the Christmas spirit, but the goblins and ghouls are sure to provide a nice scare for young kids. Especially fun are the 'new toys' created by the work crews in Halloween Town as they prepare for a good will holiday they don't quite understand.Whatever your preferred time of year, this one is to be appreciated for it's creative look and imaginative story and songs. Rather than being created to sell toys, this 3 year production changed the standards for animation films ... that's the gift that keeps giving every year!",8,1,1,20 December 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," An Untrainable Dragon
","Greetings again from the darkness. What usually sets apart a great mystery thriller from an average one is the story. In part one of the Millennium trilogy based on Stieg Larsson's books, the story is really good, but the point of difference comes in the titular performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth. American audiences are rarely treated to this type of raw, gritty performance from an actress. She alone makes the film worth seeing.Please don't get me wrong ... I really like the film. A murder mystery who-dunnit that on the surface appears like an Agathy Christie story, it quickly proves to us how looks can be deceiving - both in story line and in characters. Though the story wraps up a bit too neatly, the long winding road (over a fortuitous bridge) gives us a wild ride of hints, suspects and research that is a blast for those who enjoy such things.Michael Nyqvist stars as Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative writer who gets set up on charges of libel against a powerful businessman. While awaiting his jail time, Blomkvist is hired by an 80 year old uncle of a girl gone missing some 40 years ago. Oh yes, she is part of the Vanger family who live on a private island and who have multiple members with a history of Nazi loyalties. As Blomkvist investigates the ancient mystery, it turns out he is being followed via super-hacker Lisbeth. After a few twists, these two turn into a highly unlikely, but very interesting and effective mystery-solving couple.Besides the performance of Rapace, what really sets this one apart is that the villains really aren't the most interesting characters - Blomkvist and Lisbeth are. We are treated to a great deal of character development for both, and trust me when I say, Lisbeth's story is not pleasant.I hear this will be Americanized in the remake and that makes me sad. The edgy undercurrent of sex, abuse, politics and religious racism will undoubtedly be softened and surely the lead actress will bring little of the fascination that Noomi Rapace delivers.",8,2,5,18 April 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The Terror is in this Room
","Greetings again from the darkness. What a thrill it must be for George Clooney to see his pet project come to life in such a meaningful and impressive manner. Many have seen the interview where Clooney beams when re-telling the story of his dad's review of the film, 'You got it right'.The film opens with an Edward Murrow speech given the week before I was born. His words are just as powerful now as they were then. TV can, and does, manipulate the viewer. Of all the changes of the past 40 years, few mention the dramatic changes in TV news. Today's broadcasts are dominated by two things: the impressive looking anchor who reads the teleprompter and the investigative reporter who tries to blow the lid off some new scandal (we have Watergate to thank for this). As Murrow says numerous times during the film, dialog on the issues is key. Sadly, this is a lost art.From that opening speech, David Strathairn is Edward Murrow. He so fully captures the drive, integrity and quest for truth. Just as powerful is his near-disgust at having to provide the 'person-to-person' pieces that CBS demands as balance for the hard pieces he lives for. As terrific as Strathairn's performance is, I would not label this as a bio film. It is much more an expose on a period of our history that was downright frightening and how lucky we are that someone was courageous enough to stand up and point out the injustice of the accusations from Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his committee. McCarthy's actions so went against the foundation of our country that normal, everyday people were intimidated to the point of being paranoid and afraid to discuss the topic of communism. How amazing that this was only 50 years ago.Writer/Director/Actor Clooney assembled a very strong supporting cast including Robert Downey, jr., Patricia Clarkson, Ray Wise, Jeff Daniels, Frank Langella as William Paley, and Grant Heslov as Don Hewitt (future backbone of '60 Minutes'). Clooney made two decisions that really add to the authenticity of the film. First, he filmed in Black and White. Second, he used actual clips of McCarthy. Nothing is scarier than reality.This film would make for great classroom discussion in High School civics or government classes and could be a great tool for future and current journalists. Kudos to Clooney for bringing this uncomfortable time in history back to the forefront to ensure history does not repeat itself.",8,5,9,10 November 2005
Guardians of the Galaxy," Dance like Kevin Bacon
","Greetings again from the darkness. Get ready for a new brand of Marvel movie heroes. You surely know Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk, but it's high time you are introduced to Peter Quill, Rocket Raccoon, Gamora, Groot and Drax. Instead of dark, gloomy and super-serious, these guys aren't just funny ... they are actually FUN! The plot is admittedly a bit simple. Everyone involved is basically chasing a ball (the orb) around the galaxy. Instead of good guys vs bad guys, it's actually kinda bad guys vs really bad guys. See, the heroes of our story are for the most part criminals themselves. The main difference is, they aren't after intergalactic super power and mega destruction like Ronan (Lee Pace). Ronan makes for a pretty menacing villain, especially with a voice that shook the theatre! The band of misfits thrown together by circumstance actually provide much entertainment. Chris Pratt ('Parks and Recreation') is the self-nicknamed Star-Lord, better known as Peter Quill. The film begins in 1988 as Quill's mother dies and he is abducted by aliens. His criminal activity has him crossing paths with Gamora, a green assassin played by Zoe Saldana; Rocket, a brilliant, wise-cracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper; Rocket's bodyguard Groot, an unusually mobile and talented tree voiced by Vin Diesel; and the hulking, knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer who is bent on revenge, and played by WWE star Dave 'The Animal' Bautista. It's a rag-tag group of heroes unlike anything you have seen before.Despite the lack of familiarity with these characters most viewers will bring, writer/director James Gunn (Slither) works wonders in having us quickly connect and even groot ... err, I mean ... root for these guys. Quill's possession of a Sony Walkman to play his mother's mix tape from the 1970's and 80's gives the film a very different flavor, as the familiar songs pop up at just the right time.Pratt does an admirable job in the lead, and though compared to the GQ Tony Stark/Iron Man he is more Mad Magazine, his Quill is funny and easy to like. The best comparison I have for Quill is Han Solo, and for the film I would say it hearkens back to 1978's Superman ... both very high compliments. It's also the first time I have been completely caught off guard and laughed outloud at a Jackson Pollock reference.",7,2,6,2 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Thinking Differently
","Greetings again from the darkness. This year's holiday movie season has presented us with three very different war-based films - each a potential Oscar contender, and each with its own life lesson. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum (the excellent Headhunters, 2011) brings Andrew Hodges' biographical book to the screen in the form of the remarkable and true story of Alan Turing, the man credited by many (including Winston Churchill) for helping win WWII.Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician and cryptoanalyst. He was also homosexual. Celebrated for his work in helping Great Britain crack the German's 'Enigma' messages, he was also persecuted (through chemical castration) for his homosexuality. His suicide at age 41 (1954) was the likely result of his 'treatment' during an era when such 'unacceptable' behavior overshadowed any and all mental genius.The film utilizes Turing's 1951 police interrogation by a sympathetic and curious detective (Rory Kinnear) as a framing device for the three significant time periods of his life. We see Turing as a bullied schoolboy (played by Alex Lawther) discovering the early signs of his own brilliance, as well as his first love. Most significantly, we witness Turing's work with the Hut 8 team at Bletchley Park as they worked on complex code-breaking; and finally we see the remnants of a broken man, bathed in solitude and work, who has no real place in society.Benedict Cumberbatch gives an astounding performance as Alan Turing. We cannot take our eyes off of him, despite his Asperger's-type social awkwardness. Cumberbatch manages to expertly capture each extreme emotion that befalls Turing, not the least of which is the frustration of the genius, when lesser minds are unable to follow his vision. Some of the best scenes are of Turing's confrontations with a Royal Navy Commander (perfectly played by Charles Dance), and of course, the critical moments with the other members of his code-breaking team (including Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley).There are so many aspects to Turing's story: his impact on ending the war, how society treats true genius, his isolated childhood and final years, the extreme lack of civil rights for homosexuals of the time, and how his work on 'Christopher' led to the development of computers. The second half of the film certainly presents the moral quandary, and the performance of Cumberbatch as a tortured genius overpowers any clichés that might creep in. Alexandre Desplat's piano and strings score is a nice compliment without ever becoming overbearing, and the use of actual war newsreels adds just enough reminder of what the mission was for this group of geeks (today's terminology).",7,6,14,26 December 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Nobody, Nobody But ... QT
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Tarantino has done it again.  The creator of the incomparable 'Pulp Fiction' has given us a gift of unique creativity on the big screen.  In part, this is a tribute of the old 'chop-sockey' movies, but is is SOOOOOOOO much more!  Casting Uma Thurman (who would have thought?) as the Kung Fu expert assasin is pure genius.  Her fight scenes are remarkable.  The touches of QT humor throughout are quite the contrast to the ongoing bloodbaths and severed limbs.  His use of black & white and cuts make the violence tolerable and some of the shots are pure magic.  The flashback scenes provide most of the story line for us and the Death List 5 are all given glimpses, while a couple are featured in this most entertaining part one.  We have come to depend upon Tarantino to deliver something new to us - this is tremendous pressure, yet he continues to deliver.  His long list of outlandish characters is added to with Lucy Liu's bodyguard, GOGO.  She is right up there with Samuel L. Jackson from 'Pulp Fiction'.  I must advise all to pay special attention to QT's use of music throughout.  The opening credits are remarkable with the haunting voice of Nancy Sinatra, but hold on for the musical roller coaster after that!  Count me in for part 2 in February - and at least one more viewing of part one before then!",9,0,1,11 October 2003
Saw II," Safe and Sound
","Greetings again from the darkness. The second in 'Saw' series has many more victims involved - this time some outside the game. First time director (and co-writer) Darren Lynn Bousman teams up with Leigh Whannell (from the first one) to try and take the series to the next level of evil.Returning are (the always juicy) Tobin Bell as John/Jigsaw, Dina Meyer as the detective (Dina - time to take your career out of horror films)and Shawnee Smith who returns as Amanda. Adding some punch to this one is Donnie Wahlberg who is always solid as the almost normal, quietly off-center cop. Also among those added to the mix are Glenn Plummer (the guy with the dog in 'The Day After Tomorrow') and Beverly Mitchell (from the recently canceled '7th Heaven').The same formula is used, but we have more desperate types in this one. Time, again, plays a crucial role and as you would expect, things are not always as they seem. I do tend to enjoy the evil cat and mouse game, but be prepared for a gore fest.You know what to expect and 'Saw II' delivers.",6,1,2,15 November 2005
Clash of the Titans," Perseus, Let's get Kraken
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have a weakness for the 1981 version and still get a kick out of Ray Harryhausen's stop-action art in that film, as well as the Sinbad films. One of my favorite trivia questions is 'What film starred both Harry Hamlin and Laurence Olivier?'. That cracks me up, and stumps most people ... even though most have seen the original.Director Louis Leterrier provides a remake that is very much a film project of current day despite the mythology involved. Here, Liam Neesom as Zeus and Ralph Finnes as Hades are (not so close) brothers supposedly battling for the same thing - getting those pesky humans back in line. This comes after the army of Argos gets fed up with the whims of the Gods and makes a move toward independence. You either know the story or not, but either way shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the movie.Sam Worthington, fresh off his 'Avatar' fame makes for a solid Perseus, the half-son of Zeus (thanks to an earlier trick, that most would call rape). However, I never could make sense of his perfectly barbered look of facial and scalp stubble, while those around him all sport the late-60's Hell's Angels look. Gemma Atherton (former Bond girl) plays the quasi-God who is to protect Persues, and Mads Mikkelson (former Bond villain) fights alongside him. However, this is not an actor's film.The special effects are bountiful. Hades comes and goes as a cloud of thick black smoke and is quite comfortable splitting himself off into a flock of evil-spirited flying dragon things. Pegasus, the flying horse is back, as are the giant scorpions, who are much bigger and badder than before. Still don't understand how they went from mean to sweet between scenes. Of course, the coolest thing is Medusa and her hairdo of creepy, crawly snakes. That's one bad chick. The most impressive special effect is the Kraken, Hade's underworld pet who is 'released' to destroy mankind (unless Perseus can stop him).There is one humorous tip of the cap to the original, but most of the other shots at humor fall extremely flat. This is not a movie to see for the dialogue. The mythology and wonderment of the Gods have a certain appeal, though this one certainly falls short in providing us any real insight into the daily tasks of the lucky few on Olympus. So enjoy this one for what it is ... and stump your friends with that trivia question!",6,3,6,4 April 2010
Jurassic World," Chaos Theory
","Greetings again from the darkness. I'm guessing that most anyone who enjoys movies and is at least 30 years old, has vivid recollections of Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park from1993. The iconic theme from John Williams, that initial awe-inspiring look at the dinosaurs grazing in the valley, the reminder that 'objects are closer than they appear' in side mirrors, and the late Sir Richard Attenborough stating that he 'spared no expense' in creating the park  all merged to became part of an incredibly moving and huge new movie theatre experience. This latest (and fourth in the franchise) offers us 'big', but very little 'new', and unfortunately nothing very 'moving' in its presentation.Set two decades after the tragic and messy park trial run of that original movie, we find Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help) managing the financially-challenged theme park owned by Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi). Chris Pratt is training Velociraptors, while BD Wong is cooking up hybrid and genetically modified monsters such as Indominus Rex – designed to excite the audiences who have become bored with an old-fashioned T-Rex.Even though this is technically a sequel, there are numerous similarities to the original film, and a fun parlor game consists of spotting all the homage's and tributes sprinkled throughout. Two of my favorites are the 'Winston's' shop in the park, and the ViewMaster shot early on. These two are tips of the cap to Stan Winston and Ray Harryhausen  two giants in the world of special effects.In what has become the Hollywood 'go to' for evil-doers, the secret plan to militarize the dinosaurs is being carried out by Vincent D'Onofrio. Of course, this clashes with Pratt's ideal life for 'his' trainees. The mandatory kids-in-peril are played by Ty Simpkins (Insidious) and Nick Robinson. Much has been made of the absurdity of Ms. Howard's numerous scenes of sprinting in high heels, and I found her overall demeanor to be every bit as exaggerated and unbelievable as her actions in heels. Jake Johnson (TV's 'New Girl) and Omar Sy (so wonderful in The Intouchables) were the most 'real' characters, though neither was given much to do.Much of what is written here is 'in comparison' to the original. While this may not be fair, it is inescapable when dealing with such a respected and iconic film. Youngsters unfamiliar with the original film, are likely to find this one exciting – even terrifying at times – and that's an important distinction to make. The Mosasaurus alone is worth the price of admission  and good for a few nightmares! And who among us wouldn't pay up for a Baby Triceratops ride in the Petting Zoo? For the Jurassic Park stalwarts, the inconsistent (sometimes great, sometimes fake-looking) CGI will be as tough to overlook as Ms. Howard's cartoon character. And yes, composer Michael Giacchino is new to the Jurassic series, and he is wise enough to work in the terrific and familiar John Williams theme in more than one scene. However, none of the downsides will keep the true fans away, and there is an entire generation of kids who should have the chance to marvel at lifelike dinosaurs on the big screen courtesy of director Colin Trevorrow (previously known for his work on the indie gem Safety Not Guaranteed).",6,5,14,21 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Smile, You're on Candid Camera
","Greetings again from the darkness. With an all out frontal assault on our fears of what happens while we sleep, writer/director Oren Peli, takes a page from Blair Witch Project and presents this as actual footage. Instead of a bunch of nausea-inducing, running through the woods holding a camera ... Peli gives us a slightly more controlled video package from our lead players, Micah and Katie.Neither Micah nor Katie have any real acting ability, and I believe were cast because they come across as believable. Actually, as the movie went on, I found both a bit annoying and found myself rooting for the demon after awhile. Seriously, there are some very creepy moments which I won't give away and I did enjoy the approach of the stalking demon, instead of a possessed house.As for a fright factor, I still rank The Shining and Poltergeist as far superior but these days, any horror film that doesn't involve major slashers has to be commended. And congratulations to the team for creating a huge film phenomena with very little money.",6,2,4,26 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Stop your Mumbling
","Greetings again from the darkness. With Tim Burton ('Edward Scissorhands' 'Big Fish', the underrated 'Beetlejuice' and the underviewed 'Frankenweenie') at the helm, there was little doubt that this version would follow the novel much closer than the original kiddie film with Gene Wilder and the torturous Sammy Davis, Jr song.What was not anticipated was the eeriness Johnny Depp would bring to his portrayal of Wily Wonka. He is downright freaky and creepy!! It is amazing and captivating to watch Burton and Depp craft the story of the isolated man-child and his disgust with all things impure. Depp's performance drives the film to depths it would have otherwise not reached.The sets are great, although the CGI are mediocre at best. Deep Roy as ALL of the Oompa Loompas is excellent although the difficulty in catching all lines of 'their' musical numbers was disappointing. What we could hear was very funny. The great Danny Elfman produced another terrific score and also recaptured his Oingo Boingo days by writing and performing the Loompa numbers.Overall, this is not an actor's film. However, in addition to Depp, young Freddie Highmore (captivating as Peter in 'Finding Neverland') delivers a nice, hug-able performance as Charlie. Fine in supporting roles are David Kelly ('Waking Ned Devine'), Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor (frighteningly real as Hitler in 'Max') and the great Christopher Lee (veteran of over 200 films). The biggest disappointment was in the casting of the 'other' kids and their parents. Surprised Burton couldn't do better.This film is funny, touching and often surreal. As with the novel, it carries a message and is not meant for young children. Some of the dialog is difficult to hear (especially the songs) but there are plenty of laughs and WOW's!!",7,1,3,21 July 2005
The Adjustment Bureau," The Chairman's Door
","Greetings again from the darkness. Philip K Dick was one of the more prolific sci-fi writers and his works include Blade Runner, Minority Report and Total Recall. He also wrote The Adjustment Team, the short story upon which this film is based. The premise is fascinating: the 'bureau' is a team who influence/adjust the timing of events so as to lead mankind toward a predetermined future.Matt Damon plays David Norris, the rising young star in New York politics ... that is until a college prank is revealed and scandal ensues. On election night, prior to his concession speech, he meets Elise (Emily Blunt), the girl of his dreams in the men's room. I was struck with just how few times a man meets his dream woman in the men's restroom. Their charming banter and immediate connection lead Norris to make a heartfelt speech that thrusts him right back into the hearts of the voters.When David and Elise meet by chance on a bus, a mysterious force begins to reveal itself. David is exposed to The Adjustment Bureau and told to stay away from Elise, lest he ruin both his dreams and hers. Of course, this isn't really a sci-fi thriller in the traditional sense. It's much more a love story ... a love story for two people who seem pre-destined to be together. And that's the conflict.The story is really a debate between fate and free will. Does destiny lead us down the path or do we make our own way? The Chairman of the Bureau is clearly a reference to a God-like power, but his 'angels' have powers limited to shortcut door portals, slight adjustments to thinking patterns, and looking good in hats.While writer/director George Nolfi creates a pretty interesting to look at cityscape and an usually smart romantic film, it actually falls a bit short on overall effectiveness when it devotes so much running time to the explanation of how the bureau works. I would have much preferred more debate and examples of how adjustments affect free will and maintain the path to destiny. Instead we get a crash course on the inner-workings of this odd team. That said, there aren't very many better faces and voices than that of Terence Stamp, who plays The Hammer for the bureau. He is a fixer who uses less than forthright tactics in his moments of influencing David.I am probably being a bit harsh on this one considering that it is quite a bit more clever than the average studio release, but I can't help but believe it was capable of so much more.",6,1,4,6 March 2011
World Trade Center," Jesus had a bottled water
","Greetings again from the darkness. There is a bit of NASCAR appeal to Oliver Stone movies. With the car races, there is always a certain segment of viewers who kind of hope for a massive pile-up featuring fire balls. With Stone's movies, many can't wait to see his political agenda or twisting of facts to 'prove' the newest conspiracy theory. It is with both relief and dismay that I report 'WTC' is a right down the fairway presentation of one sub-plot of the tragic 9/11 events.Port Authority Police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno were two of the twenty people rescued from the tower rubble after the collapses. Knowing that much going in prevents any real dramatic suspense from being generated. That said, watching human pain and suffering is never easy and with excellent directing and acting, it can still be fascinating to behold. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena are effective as McLoughlin and Jimeno. The dynamic of their near hopeless state is staged very well. However, the real story here is the families endurance and dealings with the not knowing the status of their loved ones. Playing the buried officer's wives are the wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. Both bring as much heart and emotion to these women's actions as possible. Yes, it borders on heavy-handed melodrama at times, but don't forget these are tragically real events.As with most Stone films, the supporting cast is very good. Included are Nicky Katt, Stephen Dorff, Frank Whaley, Jay Hernandez, Patti D'Arbanville and Harmonica Sunshine (playing a hooker, but I just love that name!). Don't miss the cameos by the real life McLoughlin and Jimeno and brace yourself for the entire sequence of the disaster and shock of those in the middle of it. This is no Michael Bay schlock action movie, this is a combination of amazing sets that we are all too familiar with.The little human story of this horrible time in our history can provide hope to all in regards to the strength of the soul and spirit of so many.",8,7,16,12 August 2006
Cold War," star-crossed lovers
","Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good love story? The wonderfully talented filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski proves to us the massive difference between a story of 'good love' and a 'good story' of love. With two lead characters based (somewhat) on his own parents (and named after them), we witness how two people can be simultaneously meant for each other AND not meant to be together. It's the story of a man and woman forever connected, yet painfully mismatched.Director Pawlikowski's extraordinary last film, IDA (2013) won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film, and this time he starts us off with a curious montage of Polish folk musicians (including bagpipes and violins) performing their songs ... each in stark and static close-ups. This strange opening only makes sense to us much later, as we realize what a key element music plays in the numerous shifts in tone - the chapters - of the story.Former lovers Wiktor (Polish star Tomasz Kot) and Irena (Agata Kulesza, IDA) are co-directors of a Polish song and dance performance team, and as they are conducting auditions, Wiktor is immediately drawn to Zula (Joanna Kulig), one who has a pure singing voice but a questionable past to go with no previous dancing experience. Irena recognizes lust when she sees it, but Wiktor stands firm that he perceives Zula's stage presence as something special. The film covers the period of 1949 through 1964, and in that time we watch as Wiktor and Irena are both proven right. Mr. Kot and especially Ms. Kulig deliver extraordinary performances ... truly captivating.Director Pawlikowski offers up a love story unlike anything we've ever seen on the big screen. Wiktor and Zula experience the most tumultuous and romantic ride through Poland (the company first performs in Warsaw), East Berlin, Paris, Yugoslavia, back to Paris, and back to Poland. There were likely some other stops along the way, but those are the ones I made note of. Sometimes they are together, other times they are separated. It's 1952 East Berlin where they formulate a plan to defect ... only Zula is a no show, and they don't meet up again for a couple of years. In one Paris rendezvous a few years later, Zula explains to Wiktor that she married another man 'for us'. Somehow this makes sense.It's best to know no other specifics of this relationship. Star-crossed lovers is not a phrase used much these days, and perhaps even that description falls short. What causes someone to sell their soul for another - or sacrifice so much? How can so much pain and humiliation be accompanied by so much longing and yearning? What's fascinating is that the film's music styles shift in tone right along with their relationship. Sometimes the music is political (with a Stalin poster) - as that is the wall between them, and then later Zula is dancing totally free to 'Rock Around the Clock'.There are no wasted words here. The black and white images of cinematographer Lukasz Zal complements each segment with the appropriate softness or harshness depending on the characters' emotions of the moment. Certainly at the heart of this story is the role of memories ... how snapshots in time can impact our feelings, at times causing us to be oblivious to rational thought. As viewers, we experience a constant feeling of impending doom - even during the good times for Wiktor and Zula. The unusual editing style of extended cuts to black signal shifts in time ... the blackness held for an extra beat or two, allowing us to brace for the next chapter. Polish jazz pianist Marcin Masecki scored the film - a crucial element not just because our two main characters are musicians, but because the music guides us through the lives we see. The film recalls the crown jewel of mismatched lovers in CASABLANCA as two lovers apparently meant to be together, but real life circumstances prove too much. Yet another excellent film from Pawel Pawlikowski.",9,1,5,3 January 2019
Black Snake Moan," Unchained Medley of Blues
","Greetings again from the darkness. What to make of the latest from 'Hustle and Flow' writer/director Craig Brewer. Hopefully, this one was designed as camp. I see it living on as a cult favorite for midnight movies. I kept waiting for Angie Dickinson to pop up as the town bordello matron! Christina Ricci spends two hours writhing around in her underwear trying to fight off the built-in urges that don't seem to be cured by the cough syrup Samuel L. Jackson borrowed from the pharmacy lady who has a crush on him. Oh, sorry ... forgot to mention much of her writhing occurs while sporting the heavy 50 ft. chain that Mr. Jackson locked around her waist and his radiator as he sets about trying to cure her.All of this happens while Ricci's true love goes off to join the military. Except he comes back a week later because he gets frightened by loud noises. For that reason alone, one would think he would stay away from Ricci! Sorry again, forgot to mention that the sensitive military failure is played by ultra-sensitive, tough guy wannabe, Justin Timberlake ... who may be the only one who doesn't sing in the film.Watching and listening to Mr. Jackson play the blues is funny enough in itself, but when he hits the stage to a packed house who view him as the second coming of Robert Johnson ... again, I laughed! Did I mention a preacher shows up a couple of times? First to counsel Ricci about breaking the chains of her evil ways and again for couples counseling after a tearful and shaking Timberlake fails (yet again) to kill Jackson.This one is definitely not for everyone, as you might guess from the drugs, cursing, boozing, wild sex, assault, kidnapping, bondage, nearly naked people, frequent underwear moments, blues club dance moves and an overabundance of fringe religious bellowing. If you are a bit twisted, you will definitely see the humorous and campy moments and please don't take any of it too seriously. It is just a slight step up from Mr. Jackson's horrible 'Snakes on a Plane' ... but the music is much better (except for the singing).",4,9,19,4 March 2007
The Hangover Part II," It' Happened Again ... And Again
","Greetings again from the darkness. Two years ago, director Todd Phillips presented a highly creative, hilarious, raunchy, unique film comedy called The Hangover. And now, he does it again. He presents that SAME film again. I am unsure whether this is a sequel or remake. The only substantial change is the setting ... Bangkok instead of Vegas.Now I fully understand WHY most sequels follow the formula created by the successful original film. Filmmakers want to keep their audience satisfied. If it worked once, it will work again. Especially when the first film grosses a half-billion dollars! So the chances are very good that if you liked the first one, you will also enjoy this one. But for me, I get excited for creative filmmakers ... not re-treads.The key characters are all back and played by the same guys: Bradley Cooper (Phil), Ed Helms (Stu), Zach Galifianakis (Alan), Justin Bartha (Doug), and Ken Leong (Mr. Chow). All of these guys have worked constantly since the first film, but it makes perfect sense to return to the scene that put them on the Hollywood map.This time around, Stu (Ed Helms) draws the long straw and has the storyline based on his pending marriage to Jamie Chung (Sucker Punch). Stu's 'wolfpack' buddies agree to a one-beer bonfire beach bachelor party, but of course, something goes very wrong. The next morning finds our boys staggering to regain consciousness in a sleazy Bangkok hotel with no recollection of the previous night's events. The only clues are a monkey, a severed finger, a facial tat and international criminal Mr. Chow.No need for me to go into any details or spoil any moments. You know the drill if you have seen the first. What follows is nearly two hours of debauchery and moments of varying levels of discomfort, gross-out and comedic skits.Supporting work is provided by Paul Giamatti, Jeffrey Tambor, and Mason Lee (Ang Lee's son). There is also a cameo by Nick Cassavetes as a tattoo artist. This role was originally meant for Mel Gibson, and later Liam Neeson. Cast and crew protests kept Gibson out and Neeson's scenes were cut when re-shoots were necessary.I feel tricked by Mr. Phillips. The first Hangover had me excited that a new comedic genius had entered Hollywood and would quickly blow away the Judd Apatow recycle jobs and copycats. Instead, we get Todd Phillips copying Todd Phillips.This is certainly an above-average comedy and there are plenty of laughs from the characters we kind of feel like we know - though, wish we didn't. Just know going in that are witnessing a clear attempt at cashing in, not a desire to wow.",6,108,149,29 May 2011
Prisoners," Be Prepared ... or Seek Vengeance
","Greetings again from the darkness. This film is one of those goldmines for discussion and debate. Each successive scene begs the viewer to judge the actions of those involved, but even beyond that, the movie is screaming to be picked apart by those of us prone to do so. It's actually the best of both worlds for film lovers ... it challenges us on a personal and moral basis, and also as one who analyzes scripts, acting choices, and filmmaking techniques.Having seen the trailer, I was very much aware of the foundation of the film ... two young girls are kidnapped and, frustrated with the lack of progress by the police, one of the dads seeks his own form of justice. So I couldn't help but cringe with the obvious metaphor opening scene where Hugh Jackman's character (Keller Dover) experiences one of those life-bonding moments with his teenage son Ralph (played by Dylan Minnette). Once past that, the set-up is expertly handled ... two middle class families sharing friendship and Thanksgiving dinner. Keller and his wife Holly (Maria Bello) have two kids: Dylan and their young daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimokovich). Their neighborhood friends Franklin and Nancy are played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, who have a teenage daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) and young daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Perfect families and perfect friends shattered by a horrific ordeal when the young girls go missing. The main suspect is a simplistic man-child who drives a ratty RV. Alex Jones is played by Paul Dano in the most uncompromising manner possible.Enter Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). Loki is an odd bird who never lets a case go unsolved. His quirky personality and facial ticks and buttoned-up shirt provide us with enough backstory that we understand his dogged pursuit and need to work alone. As the story unfolds, we are overwhelmed with an abundance of terrific story lines. In fact, there are so many that we feel downright cheated at all the deadends and dropped-cold sub-plots.As a father, I certainly could relate to Keller's relentless, stop-at-nothing pursuit of the first and only lead. Exactly where would I draw the line for my own actions? I can't answer that other than to say that I totally understood his approach. That's not to say I condone such actions, only that I fully empathize. Holly's reaction to the ordeal is to curl up in bed with meds. That too is understandable. Loki's frustration with his own department and the false leads is also understandable. So while each character's actions make sense, the viewer's frustration is palpable, not just because of these things, but in the mis-use of such fine actors as Mr. Howard, Ms. Davis, and Ms. Leo. Jackman, Gyllenhaal and Dano dominate through much different methods, yet we viewers constantly find ourselves wanting to know more about the teenage kids, the priest played by Len Cariou, and of course, the Howard and Davis characters.The film's message is not vague. It's quite clear, even overly obvious. Keller is a survivalist ... the kind of guy who is prepared for any disaster. No matter how prepared one is, the loss of a child will test your morals, faith and inner-strength. What would you do? How far would you go? Is there a line you won't cross to protect your family? Those questions are much simpler until real life forces you to answer.One thing you will quickly notice is just how stunningly beautiful this film is. The credits provide the answer in Director of Cinematographer Roger Deakins, probably the best in the business. French-Canadian Director Denis Villenueve gave us the exceptional Incendies, and while this one has plenty to offer, I believe some fine-tuning with writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) could have elevated this one to Oscar worthy material. So take your friends and be prepared for post-movie discussion. Everyone will have their own thoughts and opinions. That doesn't make this a great movie, but it serves the purpose of getting us to question our faith and beliefs.",7,1,2,22 September 2013
Silence," a discomforting masterpiece
","Greetings again from the darkness. Martin Luther King said 'Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase'. Martin Scorcese's esteemed film career could be described as unveiling that staircase, one step/film at a time. Religion, spirituality and yes, faith, have played a key role in his life and his films – most notably, Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ, but also most of his other projects.A high-ranking priest (Ciaran Hinds) is meeting with two younger Portuguese priests and informing them of the rumor that their mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has reportedly renounced his faith and is now living as a Japanese Buddhist in Nagasaki. The two young Jesuit priests, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) refuse to believe this and request to be allowed to track down Ferreira and bring him home. It could be termed a rescue mission, and the two men could be called missionaries, but what follows is an excruciating test of their own faith. Martin Scorcese has been working on this passion project for more than two decades – ever since he read the Shusaku Endo novel (published in 1966). Cast members have changed through the various iterations of the project, but after the box office success of The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorcese received the financial backing to bring his vision to the screen. He co-wrote the screenplay with Jay Cocks (Gangs of New York) and the result is the visual and emotional epic that you might expect from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. 17th century Christianity in Japan might be a difficult subject to sell to the general movie-going public, and Scorcese goes out of his way to leave unanswered the multitude of questions the film raises. Rather than wrapping it up with a clean ending, he leaves viewers craving further discussions, clarity and explanations. In other words, it lacks mass appeal and shouldn't be confused with light-hearted entertainment.Rodrigues is resolute in his belief that God is the answer  even when the film's title is at the forefront. As Rodrigues and Garupe minister to the village of secret Christians (led by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto) at night and hide during the day, we learn of the Japanese state's commitment to eradicating Christians and Christianity to ensure the power and isolation of the country. The oddest character in the film is that of Kichijiro (an excellent Yosuke Kubozuka). He is both guide to the priests and a constant challenge to their faith, while also providing moments of comic relief in a film with very few. Were this a Kurosawa film, this role would have been a perfect fit for the great Tishiro Mifune.The most obvious adversary for the priests is the Japanese elder known as The Inquisitor. Issei Ogata excels in the role as a wily, half-smiling, quite knowledgeable wartime (a war on Christianity) leader intent on creating the most painful and public extermination of Christian believers and those priests who dare to infect his country (Japan's 1614 Edict of Expulsion). The torture and persecution is too much to detail here, but it portrays how even the most ardent believers could choose life over faith.The film blends fiction with some true-to-life aspects, and is most effective at asking questions and spurring thought. Which is more crucial – public or private faith? Is doubt allowable and even understandable? Is Rodrigues so committed to faith or is there also an element of martyrdom present? How about the 'Judas' sub-plots? Is it betrayal if it saves one's own life? Just where is that line? Is Ferreira a disgraced priest or simply a man valuing survival? The film is beautiful to look at (superb work from cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and editor Thelma Schoonmaker) while being exceedingly tough to watch (and quite long). Be prepared to set aside time for reflection and discussion  you may even discover some surprises in your views and beliefs.",8,4,12,5 January 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," No Strings on Me
","Greetings again from the darkness. Joss Whedon returns as writer/director for the sequel to his 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, and this time he juggles an exceptionally large and talented group of characters and actors who are not only involved in good versus evil, but also in the battle for screen time.There is no shortage of write-ups from film critics and fanboys who have analyzed every aspect of the movie from every possible angle, and while I admit to taking that same approach to most movies, there is something about the Marvel movies that cause me to flip off the film critic part of my brain and just sit back and enjoy. And enjoy I do. The characters are fun and interesting and the action is at time breath-taking.Since there are, by my count, at least 23 actors who deserve mention, it makes little sense for me to list them here. It is worth noting that the key actors all reprise their roles as Avengers, and many of those in supporting roles are back as well. This time there are also many significant newcomers, and those include 'The Twins' – Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch. Other newbies include Linda Cardellini ('Mad Men',' Bloodline') as Hawkeye's wife, Claudia Kim as Dr Helen Cho, Thomas Kretschmann as Strucker, and Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. Though each is a nice addition, it's the stellar voice work of James Spader as Ultron that really makes this movie click. Somehow Mr. Spader manages to convey a powerful presence despite maintaining a (mostly) even keel throughout. It's masterful voice acting.Missing this time out are Pepper Potts and Loki, though we hardly notice thanks to the first look at Vision (Paul Bettany) and Thanos (Josh Brolin)  plus the unveiling of Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor. If you thought the first Avengers movie made it difficult to keep up with the characters, this one will have your head spinning. It's probably the only quibble I have with it  character overload at the expense of character development. The Hawkeye family farm represents a meager attempt to have this group of superheroes set in a 'normal' environment, but it just doesn't quite work. The Avengers are at their best while snipping at each other or saving the planet  fortunately the movie offers plenty of the latter.",7,5,12,17 May 2015
Big Fish," Big Fish, Twice The Man
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Macabre director-extraordinare Tim Burton delivers his most mainstream, warm-hearted film to date.  Based on the Daniel Wallace novel, 'Big Fish' is a wonderful double-edged story of the tall tales told by Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor and his relationship with his son played by Billy Crudup ('Almost Famous').  The film features a tremendous cast including Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman as the wife of Finney/McGregor, Burton's real life wife, Helena Bonham Carter (also in a dual role), Danny DeVito, (an overacting) Steve Buscemi and Loudon Wainwright III (of 'Dead Skunk' fame).  I do not wish to give anything away but the story is a mixture of 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Forrest Gump' and 'The Princess Bride'.  Burton's remarkable direction, mostly top notch acting, and an extremely entertaining story make this a 'must see' for film goers ages 13 and up.  Younger kids would probably have a difficult time keeping up with the pace of the story.  I keep patiently waiting for Billy Crudup to become the star he should be.  Why must we be inundated with Ben Affleck films when Crudup is much more talented?  Also, Alison Lohman continues to put together an impressive resume, building upon her success in 'Matchstick Men' and 'White Oleander'.  It is a pleasure to watch her development as an actress.",9,0,0,27 December 2003
Hotel Mumbai," true and frightening
","Greetings again from the darkness. A group of quiet and focused young men with backpacks arrive by boat and then split into taxis. We hear the calm voice being fed into their ear buds. The voice assures them that 'God is with you' and 'Paradise awaits.' Of course, since this is based on true events from 2008, we know the horror that is about to be unleashed by these terrorists (more than 170 killed).This is the first feature film from writer-director Anthony Maras, and with his co-writer John Collee (MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, 2003), we are taken to CST, the train station which is one of the 12 terrorist targets. Actual footage is mixed in, leaving no doubt as to the panic and violence that unfolded. As the individuals in the group divide into their well-orchestrated terrorist teams, we flash to the morning routine at a nearby home. Arjun (Dev Patel) is frantically getting prepared for work before heading to his pregnant wife's place of work. He is dropping off their young child since the sitter was a no-show.Arjun is part of the staff at the prestigious Taj Mahal Hotel Palace, affectionately referred to as 'The Taj'. The service is impeccable ... to the point of checking the temperature of bath water for one of the guests. Those who stay here are accustomed to and demanding of the very finest. However, on this stay, they will experience the sharp contrast of ultimate luxury and raw terror. As viewers, our guts sense the feeling of dread, even as the hotel managers and staff are welcoming arriving guests such as a retired Russian Special Forces officer turned wealthy playboy (Jason Isaacs) and newlyweds David (Armie Hammer) and Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi, 'Homeland'), along with their newborn baby and nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham-Hervey).As the cold-blooded attack is carried out by the terrorists at The Taj, we witness so many innocent people mowed down with precision - some execution style. Many hotel guests find hiding spots, including an exclusive club in the heart of the hotel. The staff, including Arjun and renowned Chef Hermant Oberoi (Anupam Kher), courageously try to survive while also protecting the guests. David and Zahra get separated from each other and from their baby, leaving the nanny desperately trying to keep the oft-crying infant from being heard.We also witness the local police - undermanned, under-armed, under-trained - try their best to defuse the situation, knowing that Special Forces are 'hours away'. Courage is on display throughout the film, but this is no Jason Bourne or John McClane scenario. These are cooks and waiters and hotel guests caught in one of the most frightening situations imaginable.For cinematic effect, the attack seems to take place over the course of a single night, whereas the actual events were over 3 days, resulting in 31 deaths at The Taj. The level of tension is maintained throughout ... it's a well-made thriller centered on actual events and real people. The filmmakers seem to go out of their way to avoid any political, social or religious commentary or insight. We only know the terrorists are told to take American prisoners and 'Go and do Jihad'. It's described as 'indiscriminate terror' and that they are reclaiming what has been taken from them over the years. It is a difficult film to watch, though we understand there will always be bad people doing bad things for what they believe are the right reasons. Fortunately, there will also always be courageous and good people. More than once we hear the staff mention 'Guest is God' ... but not all of these guests were welcome.",6,31,86,29 March 2019
The Dark Knight," This is No Joke
","Greetings again from the darkness. Christopher Nolan can now stake his claim ... the Batman franchise is HIS! Taking 'Begins' to a whole new level of terror and psychology, 'The Dark Knight' is unlike any previous adaptation of a comic book, graphic novel or super hero. This redefines the category. We have Nolan, Christian Bale and the terrifying performance of the late Heath Ledger to thank for this.Nolan gives us wonderful visuals with Batman's effortless gliding through Gotham City, Bat Sonar and some pretty nice chase scenes ... including one with a stunning Lambo. His script delivers some classic lines from the Joker and multi-layers with Harvey Dent, Jim Gordon and even Luscious Fox. The fight scenes are not quite what we would hope, but the weapons are very cool ... by the way, who uses a School Bus as a get away vehicle (brilliant!!).Bale seems even more comfortable in the cowl this time, though the lines are much more blurred between the Dark Knight and billionaire Bruce Wayne. Seems like half the characters now know his identity (ok, that's a slight exaggeration). Though Maggie Gyllenhaal's Rachel Dawes is far superior to Katie Holmes', I must admit that I am glad to see the love story between the ADA and the Bat come to an end. This guy is most effective on his own ... leave the girls alone! Now to the real story. No matter what you have heard or what you expect, Heath Ledger's Joker is more chilling and terrifying than you can imagine. The make-up, the movements, the hair, the voice, the tongue flicker combined to give me chills more than once. The closest villains I can compare this to are: Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining', Malcom MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange', Anthony Hopkins in 'Silence of the Lambs', Billy Drago in 'The Untouchables' and Alan Rickman in 'Die Hard'. I believe Ledger is even more frightening. Though we get a few glimpses and a quick scene with the mobsters, Nolan teases us for the first half hour or so before we get our first extended Joker scene. Needless to say, this is the main reason I will see this film another three or four times in the theater. It is screen magic.Must offer a mention of Aaron Eckart's performance as Harvey Dent and subsequently Two-Face. He is exceptional in both ... as the White Knight of Gotham and then as the coin-flipping mad man. I am a bit worried that this may have been Two-Face's only appearance (though there is some hope). Michael Caine as Alfred, Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow, Gary Oldman as Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox are all back and this time joined by Julia's brother, Eric Roberts as the Italian mobster.There are a few items to nit-pick ... like how I miss the Bat Cave (under construction at Wayne Manor), the whole mayor story line was a bit weak, some of the high tech stuff was a bit of a stretch and the 18 wheeler chasing the police vans was difficult to follow. All of these are minor and in no way diminish what Nolan, and especially Ledger, have delivered.",9,3,7,20 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Crossing the Street
","Greetings again from the darkness. When Hollywood goes after a true story, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. With 'Titanic' and 'Apollo 13', there is no mystery to the viewer on how the story ends. What keeps us interested (or not) is the how-it-happened, or behind-the-scenes details.The 1913 U.S. Open is one of the most fascinating golf and sports stories of all time. But we know how it ends before we walk into the theatre. Where director Bill Paxton (yes, the 'Twister' actor) fails us is with the behind-the-scenes stories. He touches on the class warfare of the time and the family and personal demons that haunt both 20 year old Francis Ouimet (played right down the middle by Shia LaBeouf) and the great Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillone captures the quiet dignity of the champ). There is just very little depth or meat to the non-golf stories of the men. Toss in a pure Disney character in Ouimet's caddie, Eddie (played for all its worth by the interesting looking and full of rhymes Josh Flitter), and you have a mediocre, pleasant film that is going to please most audiences, but will be forgotten the next day.Just for fun, it should be noted that Bill Paxton's real life son plays young Harry Vardon at the beginning of the film and an almost unrecognizable Elias Kotsas plays Francis' father. Having not read Mark Frost's book, I am unable to comment on whether the source material provided more substance than the film delivers. I just know that the film is a quick high and very little else.",6,2,9,6 October 2005
Into the Wild," Join us, we have Hot Dogs!
","Greetings again from the darkness. On the road to self-discovery, Christopher McCandless meets many interesting people. The film is kind of a cross between 'Forrest Gump' and 'Harold and Maude'. Based on the true story of McCandless and his attempt to drop out of society, live as one with nature and discover his soul. He takes much of his guidance from the writings of Tolstoy, Thoreau and Jack London.The film grabs you, but you can't really be sure why. It must have something to do with all of us carrying that buried desire to really find ourselves. Problem is, we are too caught up in living life every day to do something so selfish.Emile Hirsch (the new 'next big thing') is outstanding in the lead role. We like him and find ourselves pulling for him. He is a positive influence on those he meets, although we can't be sure if the real Chris McC was this influential. Still it is fascinating to travel with him as he truly gets naked to the world.Supporting cast is fine, though Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt are given little to do. Always nice to see Jena Malone on screen (here as Chris' sister). Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker are a nice touch as the hippie couple who take Chris McC under their wing ... or is it vice versa? Vince Vaughn has a brief role as a 'great man'. Kristen Stewart plays a 16 yr old with a nice voice, short shorts and a crush on Chris. The best supporting role goes to the great Hal Holbrook as the lonely guy who teaches and learns in his stint with Chris.Director Sean Penn (yes, the greatest American actor) delivers wonderful visuals and plenty of opportunity for head scratching and soul searching. My only fault with the film is my serious doubt that this guy was such moral giant and life teacher at age 23. Heck with those skills, he could have been better than Dr. Phil!! Must mention the bevy of terrific Eddie Vedder ballads ... his best stuff in years.",8,1,5,29 September 2007
Green Street Hooligans," Blowing Bubbles
","Greetings again from the darkness. Not sure how I missed this the first time around, but it was recommended by a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fight scenes seem very realistic, but this film is more about man's need to be apart of something ... even something that might not necessarily make sense if one were to step back and analyze.The acting is surprisingly strong with Elijah Wood, Charlie Hunnam, Lee Gregory and Claire Forlani delivering performances usually only seen from the big boys. Much of the credit must go to director Lexi Alexander who shows a real flair for tension-filled scenes and getting the most out of an actor.It is a bit of a coming of age story for wimpy Wood as Matt, a journalist major at Harvard who gets expelled when he won't fight the drug charges that his roommate sent him up with. The rest of the film is Wood's search for his backbone. Hunnam proves to be an exciting and dynamic leader of men, who actually does have a soul ... even if it is a bit misguided. Forlani flashes her most expressive eyes and does a great deal with her limited role here. I expect bigger things from her over the next 10 years.Check this one out and spread the word on this hidden gem. The action is good, the dialogue is fast and fun and checking out the world of futbol firms is also very interesting.",7,0,0,30 June 2007
Blood Diamond," TIA ... This is Africa
","Greetings again from the darkness. Edward Zwick has spent the past 8 years concentrating mostly on producing with the exception of the ultra-Hollywood 'The Last Samurai'. Zwick has a strong resume that includes 'Legends of the Fall', 'Glory' and 'About Last Night'. With 'Blood Diamond' we get a very intense and interesting story that falls short of being great due to the Hollywood slickness applied.Leonardo DiCaprio follows up his Oscar-worthy performance in 'The Departed' with a wonderful portrayal of a diamond smuggler in South Africa. For his character, Archer, the film is his last shot at salvation and it results in self-discovery and soul redemption thanks to his 'partnership' with Djimon Hounsou (so great in 'In America' and 'Gladiator') and his connection to an American journalist played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. Connelly is the main misstep in the film because we just can't buy her as the 'in the thick of the action' type. Her character supposedly jumps from one world crisis to the next, but she comes across much more as the day spa treatment girl. Hounsou, on the other hand, is so real it frightened me at times. No one plays the angry man on a mission better than he.Much talk will be made of DiCaprio's accent, but it is pretty solid most of the time and only fades out in a few scenes. His accent should not make or break the film for anyone, as it is a terrific story with amazing scenery and a great deal of intensity throughout the two and a half hour running time. I may have never seen a movie with more people gunned down ... especially innocent villagers. It is a moving story based on the reality of the diamond importing business.",7,5,12,3 December 2006
Midsommar," a sunny nightmare
","Greetings again from the darkness. Summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. We are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker Ari Aster cares little for tradition. Well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. His feature film debut was last year's mega-hit HEREDITARY, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association Top 10 list for 2018.HEREDITARY was filled with darkness and dread, and Mr. Aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as Dani (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. During her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor, SING STREET) is a bit strained. The brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking Dani's family. Christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends.An awkward group conversation leads Dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to Sweden. The purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for Josh (William Jackson Harper, 'The Good Place') to work on his thesis. The other guys in the group are Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) whose family in Sweden is hosting the festival, and Mark (Will Poulter, THE REVENANT) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions.And with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. Try to picture a Folk Horror Comedy Fairy Tale Break-up Pagan Cult film, which at any given time reminds of MOTHER!, THE WICKER MAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE VILLAGE, SUSPIRIA, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. It is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. And that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. Most of it is filmed outside during Sweden's Midnight Sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for Woodstock). The daylight messes with your senses and expectations. Bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. Although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen.So without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to Sweden mushroom trip, a Waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a Powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. We also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the Queen of May. Of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late!Ms. Pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, Haley Lu Richardson) is terrific here. Her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. The excellent music from Bobby Krlic, better known as The Haxan Cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. I was so shell-shocked at the end, that I'm unable to confirm that the version of 'The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)' is that of The Walker Brothers (Scott Walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. Director Aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. The cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever.",7,12,21,3 July 2019
The Graduate," Completely Baked
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's the 45th anniversary of this film's release and it was awarded a limited theatrical re-release, which I took advantage of last evening. Unlike so many films, the big screen doesn't really bring anything special here, but then, it really doesn't require any assistance. I fall into the category of those who consider this one of the all-time best films. Not only is it off-the-charts entertaining, the dialogue is brilliant, the performances are pitch perfect, and the camera work and soundtrack are highly complimentary.As my number of viewings have increased over the years, I have become a true admirer of the performance of Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. It is heart-breaking and emotional. The first glimpse of her always makes me smile ... she is in the background as Ben (Dustin Hoffman) pinballs through the party trying to avoid the clutches of his parents' friends. Her scene in bed when she tells Ben about her college background in art and how her dreams came crashing down, her voice and facial features are filled with pain. Watch the movie from Mrs. Robinson's point of view and my guess is you too will have a renewed understanding.Of course, the age differences of the lead actors breaks all of my 'movie pet peeve' rules. Dustin Hoffman was 30 at the time and he is playing a soon to turn 21 year old Ben. Anne Bancroft has a line to Ben where she says she is 'twice your age'. Actually, she was only 36 at the time, and Katharine Ross (Elaine) was 27. Also, William Daniels who plays Ben's dad, was only 10 years older than Hoffman.The movie is based on the Charles Webb novel and the screenplay was written by Buck Henry, who also plays the hotel clerk with whom Ben has an ongoing dialogue. Calder Willingham is also credited thanks to a lawsuit brought after the fact. The director, Mike Nichols has had a terrific career, and was also a co-founder of Chicago's Second City Improv. He is also one of only 12 EGOT's: winners of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. One of Mr. Nichols' most famous collaborators is Elaine May, who plays the roommate who delivers the note to Ben ... and is the target of a most interesting camera angle.There are so many iconic moments and shots from the film. Everyone is aware of Mr. McGuire's 'Plastics' advice to Ben, and we see Norman Fell as Ben's landlord who has no appreciation for 'agitators'. It's also fun to note that we see a glimpse of a young Richard Dreyfuss who says he'll 'get the cops', and Mike Farrell (from MASH) makes his film debut as a bellhop at the hotel. It's also the final screen performance for Alice Ghostley, who many know from 'Bewitched'. One of the most famous film posters in history shows Dustin Hoffman photographed through the leg of Mrs. Robinson. Actually, that leg belongs to Linda Gray, who went on to fame as Sue Ellen Ewing in the 'Dallas' TV series. It should also be noted that the pivotal Taft Hotel in the film is actually the very famous Ambassador Hotel, which of course, is where Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. The hotel was later demolished in 2005.On a personal note, some of my favorite moments in the film include the shot of Mr Robinson reflected in the glass top table as she arrives for her first night with Ben. Also, director Nichols allows the camera to linger on a furious and disgusted Bancroft as Hoffman shows up for his date with Elaine. And yes, it should be mentioned that Katharine Ross became the 'dream girl' of the 1960's thanks to this role and her role in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. As for the Simon and Garfunkel music, the most interesting piece is the unfinished 'Mrs. Robinson' song that Nichols selected, even though Paul Simon presented it to him as 'Mrs. Roosevelt' (as in Eleanor). Singing only the chorus and relying on acoustic guitar and an endless supply of Di-di-di's, the unfinished version is a perfect fit for Ben's pursuit of Elaine. One of my guilty pleasures from the film is courtesy of Murray Hamilton who seems to just choke on his lines as he spits them out to Ben - in both of their key scenes together. Hamilton went on to be Mayor of Amity in Jaws, but his career peak was in not shaking hands with Ben.Though it's not technically the final shot, the faces of Elaine and Ben on the bus is one of the most memorable endings in movie history ... the cherry on top for one of my absolute favorite films.

Pride & Prejudice," Bewitched, Body and Soul
","Greetings again from the darkness. Get ready guys, the theater will be filled with fantastical women. The Cinderella story has always fascinated (tortured is probably more accurate) woman who think the handsome, rich prince will rescue them by falling in love at a glance and begging them to live in his giant castle. This is so much more romantic and efficient than actually getting to know someone! That said, Jane Austen was a master of creating the love story. Her dialog was light years ahead of its time. First, lovers of her books must understand that you will probably be disappointed by comparing the book to the movie. Two hours is a short time to cram in the details of subtlety of Ms. Austen's writing. Secondly, casting is key and this film surprises.Keira Knightley was selected (amidst protests from dedicates of the novel). Many know Knightley from her breakout role in 'Bend it like Beckham' and the few of us who saw her in this years' 'Domino' couldn't help be surprised at her ability to handle the demanding role of Miss Elizabeth Bennett. No question, she has the eyes and smile to handle the first half of the film, but her effectiveness for the second half could be debated.Relative unknown actor (at least in the U.S.) Matthew MacFadyen wins the lottery with his casting as Mr. Darcy. MM has the necessary ability to stand tall and not smile. He fails a bit in the romantic moments, but most women-viewers will have swallowed the hook and will not even notice.Screen veterans Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland (not really a Brit) are fine in their paternal roles and it is always nice to see the underused Jena Malone - even when cast as the slightly off center sister. And of course, no actor spews venom with the fierceness of Dame Judy Densch.Not sure how Joe Wright was selected for the director spot on this film, but he does an admirable job of filming the beauty of the countryside and capturing the pageantry of the parties. Those not familiar with the times, may be a bit surprised at the lack of color in the clothes, but Mr. Wright went for accuracy.Screen film versions of classical works will always disappoint those seeking perfection, but this one will definitely please the casual viewer and reader.",7,3,5,14 November 2005
Singin' in the Rain," Top Song & Dance
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Classic musical making its way through art houses with a remastered format that causes the colors to jump off the screen.  Never a much of a Gene Kelly fan, however, his pompous persona lends itself very well to screen star Don Lockwood.  Tremendous performances by Kelly, O'Connor, Reynolds, Hagen and Charisse drive this spectacle to heights no other song & dance film has ever reached.  I do not rate it as the best musical of all-time, because I think 'Sound of Music' and 'Music Man' are both slightly better, but only 'West Side Story' even comes close on the dancing.  O'Connor is nothing short of physically amazing on his 'Make 'em laugh' and the trio's performance during 'Good Mornin'' will leave you wanting more.  Jean Hagen is perfectly excrusciating as the screech-voiced Lina.  Truly, I think Reynolds and O'Connor should receive more credit for the success of the film.  Both are in supporting roles that nearly steal the film.  If you have never seen this on the big screen, hunt this down in your town - and take your friends and kids and parents!!",10,2,5,9 December 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'Nice' movie that proves the ride is what matters
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Writer Charlie Kaufman has a frightening brain and loves to share it.  While not at the level of 'Being John Malkovich' or 'Adaptation', this Kaufman script takes the film-goer on a ride to prove that's what it's all about.  The only thing that life in general and relationships specifically, offer are the memories and experiences.  Results matter little.  Jim Carrey bashers will surely crucify his dramatic turn, but most will see the depth he brings to the role.  He can act ... it is just difficult for many to get past the Carrey icon. Kirsten Dunst again proves she is so much more than a pretty face.  She leaps off the screen with pain and joy and eagerness.  Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson provide steady supporting roles, but the biggest disappointment is Kate Winslet.  Think knock-off of Madonna in 'Desperately Seeking Susan'. She does not have the edge necessary to pull off this role.  Her scenes come up empty when it is necessary for her to step up.  Many will liken the film to 'Total Recall', but thanks to the writing, it will take you much deeper in your feelings than Arnold ever has!  So enjoy the story (even if it a bit far-fetched) and the wonderful visuals and be thankful there are filmmakers willing to take risks.",8,0,1,20 March 2004
Elysium," Hippo as the Hero
","Greetings again from the darkness. Social commentary does not automatically make a movie 'smart'. In fact, commentary done poorly could be labeled the exact opposite. Writer/Director Neil Blomkamp's critically acclaimed sci-fi feature District 9 was creative in its approach to social issues. Unfortunately, his follow-up is a sloppy, big budget mess with too many writing shortcuts and what may be the worst performances of Jodie Foster's career.Earth in the year 2154 is an over-populated, polluted disaster that looks like what we saw in Wall-E, only with people. Earth is so bad, it has been evacuated by the ultra-rich ... an obvious statement on the 'one percenters'. The poor and downtrodden earthlings spend their lives dreaming of getting to Elysium, the space station paradise that houses the elite and is only a 19 minute shuttle ride away. On Elysium, the houses are stunning and the lawns perfectly manicured. Oh, and technology has re-imagined tanning booths into a medical marvel that can cure anything from zits to cancer. This advancement is the main reason earthlings risk everything to reach Elysium. See those poor folks have only shoddy hospitals ... an obvious statement on universal healthcare.After an industrial accident, Max (Matt Damon)is desperate to reach Elysium so he can save his own life. As expected, his selfishness evolves into focused heroism after he runs into his childhood crush Frey (Alice Braga) and her leukemia-stricken daughter. Getting yourself to Elysium is not so easy thanks to the protective nature of Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster). She is working with greedy businessman William Fichtner and earth-based mercenary Sharlto Copley to plot her political coup on Elysium ... just in case you forgot that the rich are really bad people.There is a data theft plot that, if re-directed, could open up the Elysium advantages to the entire population ... an obvious statement on open immigration. In between all of the political statements Blomkamp does throw in plenty of explosions, gun fights, aggressive robots and enough CGI effects to keep any sci-fi fan entertained. There is even a battle of exoskeleton suits between Copley and Damon. Where Arnold once said 'Get your a** to Mars', I can't in good faith say the same thing about Elysium.",4,17,33,11 August 2013
Taken," Retired, Not Dead
","Greetings again from the darkness. Was actually looking forward to seeing Liam Neeson in an action movie ... especially one written by Luc Besson. Unfortunately, just didn't find this very believable, though the basis for the story is frightening and fascinating.Curious as to why 25 yr old Maggie Grace was cast as 17 yr old Kim. Aren't there any actresses available who actually look that age? Did enjoy the hyper-energetic, thrill seeking character of Amanda, played by David Cassidy's daughter Katie Cassidy.One of my pet peeves in action movies is when the hero can scrunch his shoulders a bit and turn his head while successfully dodging automatic gunfire. Liam would have been killed a few times, especially in the car and on the yacht.I did find Liam's character interesting because of his simmering passion toward the captors and those in his way. Reminded a bit of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Still, for a dad digging into the underworld to rescue his daughter, I'll take Paul Schrader's 1979 'Hardcore' with George C Scott. While nowhere near the one-man demolition team that Neeson is, Scott really captures the disgust that a dad would feel.",7,1,4,1 February 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Displaying Muchness
","Greetings again from the darkness. A sequel?? How dare they? When I first heard that Tim Burton was taking on Lewis Carroll's story, I was very excited. What better director to take on this most peculiar work than the man who brought us Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice, Batman and others? The man is a visual genius. But a sequel?? Early in the film, we find an almost 20 year old Alice being proposed to in front of a large crowd of high society types. She spots a rabbit in the bushes and excuses herself, chases the rabbit, and quickly falls down the rabbit hole. The wild ride begins.Mr. Burton's visual feast takes Alice (Mia Wasikowska) through many of the situations we (and she) are familiar with. The main difference is this is her 'return' trip to Wonderland and she is no longer a little girl. She is told her destiny is to defeat the Jabberwocky so that the evil Red Queen's ruling power can be assumed by her sister, the good white queen. This destiny takes Alice through many sites and characters we don't often see.Johnny Depp is cast as her friend the Mad Hatter. His 'mad' look is achieved through a bird's nest of red hair, giant yellow saucer-sized eyes and make-up that would make Lady Gaga jealous. The Red Queen, who captures the Hatter, is played wonderfully by Mr. Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter. She has marvelous voice inflections and is as quick with an 'off with their heads' as she is a 'I need a pig'. Her sister, the White Queen, is played oddly but beautifully by Anne Hathaway. The sibling rivalry is a hoot.We are treated to voice work from three of the best ever: Christopher Lee, Michael Gough and Alan Rickman. Unfortunately, Mr. Lee and Mr. Gough have VERY limited lines, but it was nice of them to contribute. Also contributing are Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall and Matt Lucas.Once I adjusted to the fact that this was not a re-imagining of the original works, but rather more of a sequel or next step, the film worked fine for me. What I missed was the amazing word play of the great Lewis Carroll. Of course, anyone who actually understood his writings will probably be a bit bored with this version. Luckily, that affects very few! Mr. Burton's visuals are successful and will probably appeal to most ages. The 3-D seems to have been an after-thought and is most effective with the really cool Cheshire cat. The youngest kids will struggle to follow the Mad Hatter's accent-heavy dialogue, but the pictures and characters (Tweedle-Dee and Dumb) should be enough to keep them entertained.",7,1,5,6 March 2010
The Mummy Returns," Feels like Mummy Reruns
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Same old story for a sequel.  Make it a little bigger and a little louder, and people will flock to the theatres ... especially if it is released at a very slow time for movies!  Rachel Weisz gets much more physical in this one.  This along with a 'smart beyond his years' kid are two of the three changes from the original.  Still no story line to follow.  Just an incredible succession of special effects.  The early scenes with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, gave a flicker of hope for a real story; however, his screen time was disappointingly brief.  That is, except for the animated mess at the end.  You will not be able to stop shaking your head at his return.  Hopefully this was meant as a big joke by our 'director'.  Arnold Vosloo is the only one to put forth any acting effort, but the weak script prevents us from seeing what he's made of. Unless you have a high dollar home theatre, this will be a flop on video. Won't someone please cast Brendan Fraser in a daytime soap, so that we may be spared his moviemaking for a few years?",5,0,1,16 May 2001
The World's Fastest Indian," Tastes like Titanium
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Roger Donaldson has been very prolific in his Hollywood career creating mostly slick, ho-hum projects such as 'The Recruit', 'Thirteen Days', 'Dante's Peak' and 'Cocktail'. Although there is a touch of sap in this one, Donaldson turns on the charm for the fascinating tale of Burt Munro, the New Zealander who shocked the world with his speed records in the 1960's.Playing a bit like a motorized 'Hidalgo', the film captures your heart and imagination thanks in large part to the amazing journey of this spirited man and the terrific performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins. Making his way half way around the world with almost no money to his name, Munro realizes a life long dream of running his hand-built 1920 Indian 'motor-sickle' at the Salt Flats of Bonneville in Utah. his journey and openness introduce him to so many people along the way. His warm heart and courage just will these folks to help him out. Everyone wants ol' Burt to make it.While you may think to yourself this is just a light-hearted Hollywood feel-good film, just remember the man and the story are real. Donaldson and Hopkins worked together over 20 years ago in 'The Bounty' and have another very interesting project under way now with 'Papa' - a biopic on Ernest Hemingway. Three supporting performances really stand out: Diane Ladd, (comedian) Paul Rodriguez and Christopher Lawford (Peter's son) as Jim Moffit. Donaldson, in a nice touch, also spreads in a few appearances of the guys from the high speed world.This is one you can take the family to and almost everyone will enjoy the story, journey and spirit of Burt Munro. And believe me when I say, you will never look at Lemon trees the same again!!",8,86,97,12 January 2006
Avatar," Hey, Look at Me. I'm Doing Science!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Any lover of movies has been anxiously awaiting this 'next film' from James Cameron. If you have lost track of time, it's actually been 12 years since Cameron's 'Titanic' became the ultimate mega-box office champion. Finally, people can stop asking him what he's been up to! This is a very difficult movie to review or critique, so here is how I will describe it: it is a Film spectacle ... I mean that in a good way. 'Avatar' is an event similar to 'Star Wars' or even 'The Exorcist'. Much anticipation for seeing something we had never before seen on screen! And make no mistake, there are MANY things in this one we have never before seen. You will not find the list here because I believe this one should be viewed with as little upfront knowledge as possible.The star of the film is not the actors, and certainly not the script, but rather the technology and special effects. Be sure to see it in 3-D, the way Mr. Cameron meant for it to be seen. Some segments are breathtaking in beauty and creativity and splashes of color. I was fascinated by Pandora, the planet where most of the action takes place. The plant life, creatures and inhabitants are truly a new world from the mind of Cameron and crew. Wow.On the downside, the story is ho-hum at best and downright cheesy in more than a few scenes. Fans will easily pick out the influence of 'Aliens', 'The Abyss', the 'Terminator' series ... heck, even the song over the credits reminds of Celine Dion's claim to fame. Another negative is Sigourney Weaver's completely over the top and unbelievable scientist, and Giovanni Ribisi's mugging corporate puppet. Who would have even imagined the usual laconic Mr. Ribisi was capable of overacting? Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana are actually very good as the leads. Especially Ms. Saldana, who emotes a wide range of emotions despite heavy make-up (an understatement), and is really the best non-technical thing about the film.In a year of terrific, accessible sci-fi (Moon, Star Trek, Avatar), this one comes up short on story, but makes up for it with awe-inspiring imagery and visuals and sound.",7,4,10,20 December 2009
Frank," Inside the Head that's Inside the Head
","Greetings again from the darkness. Most movies fit pretty easily into a genre: drama, comedy, action, etc. This latest from film festival favorite Lenny Abrahamson is tough to classify. It begins with silly and funny inner-dialogue from an aspiring musician/songwriter (Domhnall Gleeson), transitions into a dark dramady with complex characters and dialogue, and finishes as a bleak statement on mental illness and the music business.That's more than I would typically disclose, but some have described the film as an outright comedy and I find that unconcsionable. If you are expecting a laugh riot, you will not only be disappointed, but are likely to miss the unique perspective provided.The screenplay is written by 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' collaborators Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. Clearly inspired by the late British comedian and musician Chris Sievey (and his character Frank Sidebottom), Mr. Ronson's work with Mr. Sievey is the driving force. It's also the reason Gleeson's character is emphasized over Michael Fassbender's titular character who dons the paper mache head for the bulk of the movie. This script decision probably keeps the film from being truly great.The exceptional and attention-grabbing first 15 minutes set up a movie that dissolves into an exploration of the creative process within mental illness ... Franks states numerous times that he has a certificate (certifiable). There is also an ongoing battle between art and commerce, as waged by Maggie Gyllenhaal's character and that of Gleeson. Social Media power is on full display as this avant-garde performance art band gathers a huge following prior to ever really producing any music.Without seeing Frank's facial expressions, we witness his transformation from mystic/guru to an unstable and socially uncomfortable dude striving for likability, but unsure what the term really means. Must artists suffer for their art? Why does society latch onto the newest social media gimmick? What is creative success and why are so many afraid of it? The film begs these and other unanswerable questions. Certainly interesting, but definitely not 90 minutes of laughter.",7,56,76,30 August 2014
Selma," Dreams
","Greetings again from the darkness. Historical dramatizations can be a tricky business, as delivering both truth and entertainment value is quite challenging. There is always an expert quick to point out any artistic license taken at the expense of historical accuracy. Of course, most movie lovers have come to accept that even the best-intentioned Hollywood looks at history will be at least as focused on selling tickets as educating the public. Because of this, the swirling controversies for this film are neither surprising nor overly distracting from its message.March 7, 1965 is known as Bloody Sunday and marks one of the most despicable moments in U.S. history. It was also a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement and can be viewed as shrewd strategy from Martin Luther King, Jr. and his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The movie makes it clear that MLK had a full understanding that Selma, Alabama and it's racist, redneck Sheriff Jim Clark provided the perfect opportunity for a violent reaction to King's demonstrations and protests. It also makes it very clear that there was boundless ignorance, hatred and racism on the part of many southern whites. If the subject matter is somehow not enough to grab your attention, the startling event that occurs 5 minutes in will surely leave you shaken.The film does an outstanding job of focusing on two pieces of this most complex puzzle: 1. the boots on the ground – the grass roots movement of the people, and 2. the ongoing political debates occurring between MLK and LBJ, between LBJ and his staff, and between MLK and his lieutenants.The Civil Rights Act had already been passed, so the efforts were in hopes of overcoming the obstacles faced by southern blacks who wished to vote. One of the film's best scenes has activist Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) trying yet again to have her voter registration processed, but being rebuffed by a county clerk through an impossible Q&A session. These intimate moments are where the film excels: Coretta questioning MLK on his love for her, MLK speaking with grandfather of Jimmie Lee Jackson outside the morgue, and MLK turning down the proposal of US Attorney John Doar (Alessandro Nivola).In an odd twist of casting, four of the leading characters are played by Brits: David Oyelowo as MLK, Tom Wilkinson as LBJ, Tim Roth as George Wallace and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King. All four are excellent, but it's Mr. Roth as the racist-beyond-belief Alabama Governor Wallace that is the most slitheringly evil, while Mr. Oyelowo gives what can only be described as a towering performance of the man many of us know only from history books and news reels (and a January holiday).The supporting cast is vast and talented, and because the story spends so much time on the individuals, many of these spend little time on screen. In addition to Andrew Young (Andre Holland), Reverend Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce), J Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and Lee C White (Giovanni Ribisi), we also see activist Diana Nash (Tessa Thompson), CT Vivian (Corey Reynolds), John Lewis (Stephen James), and Judge Johnson (Martin Sheen). The most bizarre moment has Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) in a quasi-Mr Rogers depiction as he discussed his new found approach with Coretta.The original King speeches are owned by another studio so those delivered here by Oyelowo have been re-written and revised, yet the words and Oyelowo's powerful oratory deliver the message loud and clear. While it can be argued that the film delivers only one point of view (the FBI was no friend to the movement), it can just as easily be argued that previous films have done the same thing – only from the 'other' perspective (Mississippi Burning, Ghosts of Mississippi).In what can be viewed as the first serious movie on Martin Luther King, director Ava DuVernay announces her presence with authority. She will have no need to return to her career as a movie publicist, and we will be watching to see what type of projects appeal to her after this. In a brilliant move, the story focuses on a period of just a few months in 1965, rather than tackling the MLK legacy. She presents him as a man with strengths, flaws, doubts, and determination. It's clear why so many followed him, and it's all the more painful to know that so many resisted.",7,10,21,7 January 2015
Grindhouse," Muscle Cars, Severed Limbs and Badass Cinema
","Greetings again from the darkness. The much anticipated quasi-collaboration between Tarantino and Rodriguez delivers everything we could have hoped for. The 'Double Feature' replete with shocking trailers for non-existent movie is almost as fun to watch as it probably was for the cinema bad boys to make. The best warning I can give is that some boys have toys like chemistry sets and toy trains. QT and RR have their movie cameras. This is a fantasy camp production for two lucky guys who get to live their dream in their own world.The first feature is the Rodriguez zombie flick. It is actually much better than expected and advertised. Rose McGowan is outstanding is the go-go dancer (not stripper - 'there's a difference') who loses a leg in a most unfortunate manner. Her boyfriend, played by the up and coming Freddy Rodriguez, sweetly provides her a new leg - a machine gun that later morphs into a Gatling gun. How's a guy supposed to compete with that? Sure the story is a bit weak, but who really cares? The action is non-stop and the mandatory gross out stuff is in abundance from the likes of Josh Brolin, Jeff Fahey, Marly Shelton, Stacy Ferguson (Black-Eyed Peas), Naveen Andrews ('Lost') and Michael Biehn. I would never give away anything here but will say, it is the most fun one can have in a zombie flick! Second feature belongs to Tarantino and includes everything you would expect delivered in ways you could never expect! Kurt Russell, as 'Stuntman Mike' plays the oddest bad boy in a muscle car that I have ever witnessed on screen. For extra enjoyment, remind yourself that this guy got his start in Disney films!! He has a knack for getting rid of obnoxious girls in the most violent of manners. The best filmed segment of the film is in the diner as four ladies loudly do the chick thing by yakking non-stop. The camera moves totally around the table getting views from every angle and occasionally catching Russell in the background. Brilliant. Real life stunt woman Zoe Bell is amazing in her role as a stunt woman who is always looking for that thrill in life ... this time in the form of a Dodge Challenger! The whole car chase sequence is unlike any we have seen before and QT adds a bit of humor and statement when the classic muscle cars go weaving in and out of traffic full of SUV's and 4 door sedans. Yesterday meets today ... and today looks pretty lame. The downside to this story is that Rosario Dawson is basically awful. Still not enough to take the edge or fun out of this Tarantino buffet of badass cinema.The faux-trailers are very well made and very funny by directors such as Eli Roth, Rob Zombie and Edgar Wright. Especially funny is Wright's 'Don't'. Interesting acting notes include double dipping roles (both films) for Rose McGowan, Marley Shelton, Michael Parks and Tarantino (who has extended screen time). Also Bruce Willis, Nicolas Cage and Danny Trejo make appearances, as does the great Sydney Poitier's daughter, Sydney Tamiia Poitier.Not in the classic film sense of 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Kill Bill', but hugely entertaining and funny. There are so many inside jokes here it may take 10 viewings to catch them all. One of the best is the 'missing reel' announcement just as the sex scenes get started. All of the stuttering, skipping, poor editing and black outs really did happen back in the day. We forget just how lucky we are ... both for film quality and to experience the madness of Tarantino and Rodriguez.",8,3,10,7 April 2007
The Artist," With Pleasure
","Greetings again from the darkness. Remember the last silent film that received this much adoration, acclaim and publicity? Of course you don't. It was 1927 and Clara Bow starred in 'Wings', the most recent silent film to be nominated for Best Picture (it won). My guess is, that streak is about to end thanks to French writer/director Michel Hazanavicius.No doubt many will avoid this one since it is a Black & White silent film. What a mistake that would be. It offers a wonderfully entertaining and captivating story, and two outstanding and expressive lead performances. Jean Dujardin is remarkable as George Valentin, one of the biggest movie stars in 1927 (when this story begins). It's around this time when the 'talkies' begin taking over. Valentin is a very likable character, but foolishly believes talking movies are a fad and his fans will remain loyal to him and his traditional silent films. Not only do talkies take off, but the Great Depression also hits. Valentin finds himself out of work and broke.The most fun in the film occurs when Valentin and Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) are together. Their characters have a chance meeting and there is an instant spark. Valentin gets her the first break of her career and before long, she is on the rise as fast as he free falls. Only Valentin's dog and driver (James Cromwell) remain loyal to him during the tough times, but Peppy refuses to let the bond die.It's impossible to watch this film and not notice the influence of 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'Sunset Blvd'. Also, Dujardin's Valentin looks to be a cross between Douglas Fairbanks and Gene Kelly, replete with the electric matinée idol smile. Both Dujrardin and Ms. Bejo (who is the director's real life girlfriend) have the elastic face and bright eyes necessary for silent film stardom. They really allow us as viewers to forget the silence and enjoy the characters.This is a fully realized story with excellent character development. You might wonder how this is possible with no dialogue, but that's why this is a must see film garnering an abundance of critical acclaim. It's very easy to access and is purely entertaining ... with both moments of happiness and sadness. It has everything a really good movie should have ... just with fewer lines of dialogue!",8,9,14,26 December 2011
Invictus," Political Football
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have said many times over the past few years that Clint Eastwood is the classiest filmmaker working today. We can always count on his films to be technically well made, interesting and entertaining. Invictus is no exception. What it's not is a classic film, or even one of Clint's best. Nonetheless, it is worth seeing from a historical standpoint as well as for Morgan Freeman's fine performance.The dialogue is sprinkled with many of Nelson Mandela's own words and the story is based on the book by John Carlin. Without a doubt, the best parts of the film are those showing Mr. Freeman portraying Mr. Mandela 'behind the scenes' ... whether in his office or spouting his amazing philosophy to his security crew. Whatever your politics, Mr. Mandela was a fascinating man who survived an excruciating ordeal (for almost 30 years). For his mind, body and spirit to survive is reason enough to learn more about him as a man (warts and all).The weakest part of the movie is the enormous amount of rugby time we are forced to watch. Most of the scenes/plays are staged and filmed in tight shots so as not to expose the weakness of the game or actors. Unfortunately, this makes up a huge portion of this overly long film. Obviously the rugby story line is historical and a story worth telling, but the film would have been more impactful with more Mandella musings and less fake Matt Damon rugby.As always, Clint's film score is perfect. The only shocking moment was the terrible song playing as Mandela's helicopter lands on the practice field. It was an inexcusable MTV moment from a master. Otherwise, a film to see, though not necessarily one to adore.",7,2,4,13 December 2009
La La Land," a gem with full spectrum of emotions
","Greetings again from the darkness. Is this a nostalgic throwback to the movie musicals of Stanley Donen and Fred Astaire, or is it a contemporary film designed to revitalize the movie musical genre in an era dominated by superheroes and sci-fi? However you might choose to label writer/director Damien Chazelle's follow-up to Whiplash (2014), it's clearly one of the best and most entertaining movies of the year.While the opening credits are still rolling ('Presented in CinemaScope' being the first gag), the film kicks off with its only large scale (think Busby Berkeley on a L.A. freeway rather than in a swimming pool) musical production, 'Another Day of Sun'. It's also the first of 3 less-than-warm-and-fuzzy 'meetings' between the two lead characters before they finally click.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling light up the screen with the same incredible chemistry they displayed in Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011). Mia (Ms. Stone) is a struggling actress-wannabe working behind the counter at the Warner Brothers studio coffee shop. Sebastian (Mr. Gosling) is a pianist committed to the traditions of jazz music  even as he toils in a club playing mainstream tunes for folks who aren't even listening.As their relationship develops, we get a tap dance number in the Mulholland Drive moonlight. Soon, Sebastian (kind of a brooding Gene Kelly or a dancing James Dean) is forced to make a choice between finding a way to open his own jazz club or compromising his integrity by making lots of money joining a 'hot' band (led by John Legend), while Mia is focusing on auditions and her writing (which leads to a disastrous one-woman show).Director Chazelle and cinematographer Linus Sandgren create a look in line with Singin' in the Rain, but a tone more suited to A Star is Born. There is no shortage of romance and music, but it's equally balanced with melancholy, foolish dreams, and shattered hopes. While it's an homage to old Hollywood, Los Angeles and movie musicals, it seems to gracefully swing between past and present – and reality and fantasy.Mia has a bedroom wall mural of Ingrid Bergman, while Sebastian treasures his piano stool that once belonged to Hoagy Carmichael  two more examples of past and present intertwined. Ms. Stone and Mr. Gosling possess solid (not exceptional) singing voices, which aids in having the songs tell their story. Ms. Stone is quite a talent, and especially stands out in her audition scenes  we feel her pouring her heart out to casting agents who may or may not even be paying attention. It's remarkable work from her.Supporting work is provided by Rosemarie DeWitt (as Sebastian's sister), JK Simmons (as a club owner and Sebastian's boss), Finn Wittrock (as Mia's boyfriend) and Damon Gupton. Also in supporting roles would be the Griffith Observatory (after a Rebel Without a Cause viewing), the Los Angeles scene, and the Warner Brothers lot.The 'What Could Have Been' ending sequence is top notch filmmaking in all aspects, and perfectly caps a movie that drips with nostalgia  while also being touching, funny, and downright fun. Watching this film is much like going through the ups and downs of a relationship, and it deserves to be seen on the big screen – enjoy the full palette of colors and the full spectrum of emotions (love and heartbreak, frustration, anger, and utter joy). This is one to tell your friends about  don't wait for them to tell you.",9,5,11,6 December 2016
Mama," Unless Mama's happy ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ever since The Blair Witch Project and the influence of 'found footage', which then transitioned into the endless sequels for Paranormal Activity, true creativity and ingenuity has been mostly lacking from the horror genre. One of those still devoted to creeping us out and generating seat jumping is Guillermo del Toro, who produced this film after seeing writer/director Andres Muschietti's three minute short film.Since the real joy in experiencing a horror film comes from the surprises and twists, very few details will be revealed here. Worth noting is the lead role of Annabel played by the incredibly talented Jessica Chastain. Yes, the same one who is currently nominated for her role in Zero Dark Thirty. This time out, Ms. Chastain is a tatted up bass player in a (lousy) punkish band and sporting a Joan Jett hairdo. Annabel is living a bohemian lifestyle (translation: nearly starving with no responsibilities) with her artist boyfriend Lucas, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, whom many will recognize from Game of Thrones, and who appeared in the superb Headhunters (one of my favorites of 2012).Many horror film clichés are presented here including a cabin in the woods, a portal to the afterlife, buzzing bugs, unexplained lullaby singing through the air vents, an untimely 'fall' down the stairs by a key character and ties to a long ago tragedy that holds the key to this current mess. Notable is the welcome absence of gross out and gore-out special effects. Despite the clichés, Muschietti and his co-writing sister Barbara, and Neil Cross provide us with some new touches (uncovering maternal instincts) and such a great looking movie that our attention is firmly held ... especially for the first 80%. As happens so frequently, the final act is a bit disappointing, but not enough to ruin the experience.Chastain is top notch here. Coaster-Waldau is underutilized. The two young girls are effectively portrayed by Megan Charpentier (Victoria) and Isabelle Nelisse (Lily). In fact, Lily scampering about on all fours may be as frightening as the spooky Mama, played by 7 foot actor Javier Botet. It's an unconventional horror film with an atypical ending, and certainly worth a look if you are a fan of the genre.",6,1,4,20 January 2013
Super 8," This is so Mint!
","Greetings again from the darkness. A nostalgic feeling generated by nostalgic filmmaking at the hands of JJ Abrams and classic Spielberg. Yes, I meant to use nostalgic twice ... the film has a familiar feel to it, but also entirely new twists and effects. That's what happens when the master (Spielberg) and the star pupil (Abrams) unite.Part of the nostalgia is that this is kind of a throwback to the blockbuster era that Spielberg helped create. There are bits and pieces of Jurassic Park, E.T., The Goonies, *Batteries not Included, and Jaws. Spielberg has always had a nice feel for kids and emotions, and in this film the genius of Abrams' script and special effects make for a spectacular combination.You know there is nothing more fun for these filmmakers than a story about smart, outcast kids obsessed with making a movie! Throw in the adolescent battle over the out-of-reach older girl, the somewhat demented kid who just loves explosions, the sensitive kid dealing with the death of his mother, the wise beyond her years girl who is a natural actress, and the chubby, driven boy with a camera ... mix it up with a couple of clueless parents and the evil, secretive Air Force, and you have quite the exciting small town Ohio drama with comedic elements and startling special effects.Not going to say anything about the 'surprise' that was hinted in the trailer, but what I will say is that the first hour of this movie was pure movie magic to me. Unfortunately, the second half was a slight let down, though not horrible at all. I just enjoyed the pure human elements on display before it became just another ...The film really rides on the shoulders of Elle Fanning (probably the last time I will reference her as Dakota's little sis). Ms. Fanning has proved again that she may be the most talented of the acting sisters. She really has a feel for her scenes and clearly melts the heart of young Joe Lamb, played by newcomer Joel Courtney. Also excellent are Riley Griffiths as Charles the movie maker, and Ryan Lee as Cary the demolition 'expert'. Joe's dad is played by Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights), but again, this film really belongs to the kids.The film is rated PG-13 for some pretty intense scenes and some language that many prefer not to hear coming from kids. It's too bad more films 'like' this aren't made, but that's probably a factor of not many filmmakers being in the class of Spielberg and Abrams (Lost, Star Trek).",7,4,11,12 June 2011
The Last Samurai," Neither the perfect bloom nor great conversation
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I believe this movie is getting such rave reviews because it has the look and feel of a great movie.  Definitely even 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.  The mysticism is missing.  I did see this in digital projection, rather than film, and the colors seemed to leap off the screen - especially the sky and landscape.  The one thing that prevented this from being a great movie is Tom Cruise.  He is the only out-of-place thing in the film.  Ken Watanabe is wonderful and the stunning Koyuki (as Taka) leaves the audience breathless in numerous scenes.  Even Tony Goldwyn smirks his way to the desired level of arrogance.  Cruise, on the other hand, is soul-less in his role as a drunken war hero/samurai-wannabe.  One of the most absurd moments I have ever seen on screen is when he appears in the doorway wearing the samurai armour.  Yes I understand the poignancy of the moment ... it just doesn't work.  Cruise's performance reminds me of another over-hyped performance from this season's crop of blockbusters.  Russell Crowe in 'Master and Commander' is equal to Cruise in his desire to be a movie star, rather than an actor.  The story and character should make the movie - not the celebrity.  I am not sure how much fault to lay on director Edward Zwick.  He seems to have peaked with 'About Last Night' and TV's 'thirtysomething', but this movie is just beautiful and might have worked, if not for Cruise.  Very interesting to see an almost unrecognizable Scott Wilson ('The Right Stuff') as a U.S. ambassador.  Anyway, I am always disappointed when a movie doesn't reach its potential, and 'The Last Samurai' left me feeling empty, not fulfilled.",6,1,2,14 December 2003
Up," It's Just a House
","Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.I am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along. You will be entertained, delighted and moved.",9,133,187,31 May 2009
Snowden," choose the doc
","Greetings again from the darkness. I've never really understood the artistic benefit to filming a biography after a spectacular documentary on that person has already been produced, made the rounds, and racked up awards. But then, I guess the point has little to do with art, and more to do with economics (documentaries are historically a money losing venture). Renowned director Oliver Stone brings us the story of Edward Snowden just two years after filmmaker Laura Poitrus won the Oscar for Best Documentary for her Citizenfour.Much of what Ms. Poitrus documented in real time at the Mira Hotel in Japan is re-enacted here as one of the three core story lines in Mr. Stone's film. To his credit, he fills in much of the backstory and Snowden's resume by starting with a failed attempt at joining Special Forces (tumbling off the top bunk is automatic disqualification if it shatters one's leg).Joseph Gordon-Levitt mimics Snowden's low key mannerism and measured vocals, while also fiddling with his eyeglasses during key moments. As a sought-after role for an actor, Snowden ranks a few rungs below, say Howard Hughes or Franklin Roosevelt or most any other person who has had an impact on America  just not much personality to work with – though his actions have created some of the most interesting discussions over the past few years.Joining Snowden in the hotel room are Melissa Leo as Ms. Poitrus, Zachary Quinto as journalist Glenn Greenwald, and Tom Wilkinson showing off a Scottish accent as journalist (from The Guardian) Ewen MacAskill. The second storyline takes us through the initial recruitment and subsequent rise through the CIA and NSA, as we see how Snowden continually uncovered more about how the government was spying on citizens. His interactions along the way – such as Rhys Ifans as his CIA mentor Corbin O'Brian and Nic Cage as disgruntled agent Hank Forrester – provide a spark of energy on screen. The third piece of the pie revolves around Snowden and his politically-polar-opposite girlfriend Lindsay Mills, played by Shailene Woodley.Since it's an Oliver Stone movie (he co-wrote the screenplay with Kiernan Fitzgerald), we fully expect his political views to be on full display. It's clear he is sympathetic and fully supportive of Snowden's actions, and does his best to paint him as a patriot who had no choice but to go public with his belief that the spying had nothing to do with terrorism, but was instead a form of social and economic control. Based on the books 'The Time of the Octopus' by Anatoly Kutcherena and 'The Snowden Files' by Luke Harding, the film portrays Snowden as increasingly disenchanted and disappointed, beginning in 2003 and moving through 2013.Stone's feel for visuals come into play as we track Snowden through Virginia, Geneva, Hawaii, Japan and finally Russia. Along the route, familiar faces pop up in almost every new scene - Timothy Olyphant, Scott Eastwood, Lakeith Stanfield (Short Term 10), Logan Marshall-Green, Ben Chaplin, Ben Schnetzer, and Joely Richardson. There are a couple of sequences in which Stone applies his stamp  a party with drones hovering overhead (until they aren't), and an impactful full wall Skype with Rhys Ifans' face looming larger than Snowden's entire body.Whistleblower or turncoat? Hero or traitor? Most people fall pretty clearly on one side of the debate, and there's no doubt where Stone stands. Just prior to the voice of Peter Gabriel over the closing credits and clips of the real Ed Snowden, there is a fancy edit where Stone shows him at his computer in his current home in Russia. Stone's movie makes a nice companion piece to Citizenfour, but if you are only going to see one, choose the documentary.",6,4,13,15 September 2016
A Clockwork Orange," A bit of the ol' ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Stanley Kubrick only made 11 feature films, and there have been arguments made for all 11 to be considered cinematic classics. This one must surely be included with Spartacus, Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and The Shining as films that are safe and secure in movie history. Based on the novella from Anthony Burgess, the focus on Alex makes this an extremely uncomfortable film to watch, even 41 years after original release.Malcolm McDowell is just terrific as Alex, the sadistic, remorseless, psychotic leader of a pack of hoodlums who terrorize innocents just for the sake of doing so. To emphasize Alex's distorted view of society, Kubrick utilizes a wide-angle lens to show us his Point of View. There is much commentary in the film and most of it is quite obvious. One of the least discussed is the interaction of Alex and his 'droogs'. When they tire of his relentless power-mongering and the lack of big scores from all of their criminal activity, we see how young thugs would handle such a situation.There is also much criticism directed at the British government and the world of psychiatry, especially mind-control. Kubrick obviously had extreme views on these topics as he went off-track from the source material to make his points. The idea of moral choice being the distinguishing factor of a man could be debated, but seems logical when contrasted with the anti-violence rehabilitation system favored by the minister.There are some fascinating visuals with the milk-plus bar, the artwork and wide-angle lens ... especially when focused on Patrick Magee's face during the rape scene. Also, the use of Ludwig van Beethoven to put Alex in the mood for 'ultra-violence', and then his subsequent song and dance to 'Singin in the Rain', show what the other side of music can mean to those not quite right in the head.The film received four Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, though sadly, McDowell was not recognized. While there is much in the film that is difficult to watch, the brilliance of the material, script, acting and directing are a treat for movie lovers. One bit of trivia: that is David Prowse who plays the writer's bodyguard. Mr. Prowse would go on to play Darth Vader in the Star Wars films.",9,1,3,12 July 2012
Woman in Gold," Blending art, history, justice, and identity
","Greetings again from the darkness. The responsibility of the filmmaker when the project is 'based on a true story' is elevated when the story has significant historical relevance and blends such elements as art, identity, justice and international law. Add to those the quest of a remarkable woman whose family was ripped apart by Nazi insurgents, and more than a history lesson, it becomes a poignant personal story.Helen Mirren portrays Maria Altmann, the woman who emigrated to the United States by fleeing her Austrian homeland during World War II, and leaving behind her beloved family and all possessions. After the death of her sister, Ms. Altmann becomes aware of the family artwork stolen by the Nazi's during the invasion. This is not just any artwork, but multiple pieces from famed Austrian artist Gustav Klimt  including 'Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer'. See, Adele was Maria's aunt, and the stunning piece (with gold leaf accents) has become 'the Mona Lisa of Austria', while hanging for decades in the state gallery.The story revolves around Maria's partnering with family friend and upstart attorney Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to take on the nation of Austria and reclaim the (extremely valuable) artwork that was seized illegally so many years ago. They are aided in their mission by an Austrian journalist (played by Daniel Bruhl) who is fighting his own demons. The seven-plus year legal saga is condensed for the big screen and we follow Maria and Randol as they meet with the Austrian art reclamation committee, a federal judge (played by the director's wife Elizabeth McGovern), the U.S. Supreme Court (Jonathan Pryce as Chief Justice), and finally a mediation committee back in Austria. But this is not really a courtroom drama  it's a personal quest for justice and search for identity. What role does family roots and history play in determining who we are today? It's the age old question of past vs. present, only this is seen through the eyes of a woman who has survived what most of us can only imagine.Director Simon Curtis (My Week with Marilyn) uses startling flashbacks (with Tatiana Maslany as the younger Maria) to provide glimpses of Maria's childhood through her marriage and subsequent escape. We get to know her family, including some scenes featuring Aunt Adele (Antje Traue), and Maria's father and uncle (Henry Goodman, Allan Corduner). We understand this family's place in society and just how dramatically they were impacted by the Nazi takeover.Helen Mirren delivers yet another exceptional performance and manages to pull off the snappy lines without an ounce of schmaltz, while also capturing the emotional turmoil Ms. Altmann endures. Director Curtis and writer Alexi Kaye Campbell round off some of the rough edges and inject enough humor to prevent this from being the gut-wrenching process it probably was in real life. This approach makes the film, the story and the characters more relatable for most movie goers  and it's quite an enjoyable look at a fascinating woman and a pretty remarkable underdog story.",7,83,101,31 March 2015
Invincible," Rocky in Pads
","Greetings again from the darkness. Disney throws us another inspirational true story ... this time about South Philly's Vince Papale, a local bartender who was a walk-on cult hero for the Philadelphia Eagles in the late 1970's. Think 'Rudy' in South Philly or 'Rocky' in football pads.Marky Mark does a passable job as local hero and good guy Vince, who is just one of the guys in this struggling town. First time film director Ericson Core does a passable Disney job of providing a bit of the feel of these hard nosed, blue collar people who struggle with life but always find a way to support their Eagles.The story picks up when Eagles owner Leonard Tose (played by Miohael Nouri, who is seen in the current 'Boynton Beach Club') hires UCLA hot shot coach Dick Vermeil (played well by underrated actor Greg Kinnear), following the Eagles miserable 1975 season. We get a few hints at the legendary brutal Philly sports fans and a small glimpse of home life for Vermeil, but most of the film centers on Papale and his personal struggles and his group of mostly supportive friends.Papale's love interest and future wife is played by the remarkable Elizabeth Banks (so wonderful in 'The Baxter' and '40 Year Old Virgin') who, even though a Giants fan, seems to fit right in with this group of tough guys and, of course, immediately spots and falls for Vince's soft heart.Don't miss Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly as a disgruntled Eagles fan and just see this one to enjoy the uplifting story and inspirational message it delivers. A soft PG-13 makes it OK for most kids who would have any interest in seeing it.",6,3,5,2 September 2006
Love & Mercy," God Only Knows
","Greetings again from the darkness. Beach Boys fans may struggle a bit with this one since the light-hearted, airy feel to the 'Fun, Fun, Fun' music of the band is mostly absent. Instead, director Bill Pohlad pulls back the curtain on the emotional and mental struggles of visionary songwriter Brian Wilson  the band's creative force.In an unusual artistic approach, Paul Dano plays Brian from the 1960's period that resulted in the revolutionary Pet Sounds album and the ongoing battle with his domineering father; while John Cusack plays Brian from the late 1980's - his most creatively bankrupt period and the subsequent debilitating influence of quackster psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti).The two periods are blended together as we (and Brian) bounce back and forth between the struggle of a budding musical genius working to release the sounds in his head, and a middle aged man so heavily medicated that speaking, eating and even getting out of bed are such overwhelming obstacles that music rarely registers. It's during the latter period that Brian is truly at the mercy of Dr. Eugene Landy. Giamatti sports a floppy wig and proceeds to rage at Brian while trying to charm Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), Brian's new romantic interest. Knowing this disgusting period was part of Brian's life only adds to the anger and frustration we feel  not just as fans, but as human beings.What sets this biopic apart is actually the performance of Dano and the peek inside the process of Brian's genius. Watching Brian work the musicians and mold the music on the fly is breath-taking, even though we see the challenges of his early mental issues. It's a joy to see a tribute to the studio session players known as 'The Wrecking Crew'  themselves the subject of a recent stellar documentary. It's during this period that the Wilson brothers' father (played by Bill Camp) constantly derides Brian and his 'new' music. There is also some insight into the Brian vs Mike Love battles – Brian exploring his creative music, while Mike just wants to keep cashing in with their expected 'fun' style.Some may find the two-headed approach to be distracting, but it drives home the point of what a different man he was in comparing the mid-1960's to the late 1980's. Mostly, I found the 1960's portion to be an insight into what we hear from so many geniuses, regardless of their specialty. Brian says it's like 'Someone is inside me. Not me.' His struggles are non-relatable to others – even his brothers, and especially his dad. What is mostly a look at the darkness behind the 'sunny' music, does come with real life redemption courtesy of Melinda's strength  and witnessed in the video shown over the closing credits.",7,36,49,20 April 2015
Limitless," Crystal Clear, Except when it's not
","Greetings again from the darkness. First, I absolutely love this premise. The idea that, by taking a pill, we can simultaneously access all parts of our brain and process information at hyper-speed is fascinating, and a terrific idea for a movie. As it turns out, that terrific premise loses much luster when the center of action is a egomaniacal, smirking doofus played by a strutting Bradley Cooper.The set-up portion of the film is fairly interesting. Cooper plays a stone-walled loser of a writer whose career-minded girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) wisely dumps him as he offers up very little in self-defense. A seemingly random street meet of his ex-brother in law leads Cooper to a whole new world brought on by the magic of NZT. He quickly realizes he can recall every detail he has ever seen or read and he process information quickly and clearly. He finishes his book and learns multiple languages, plays the piano, etc etc.The film takes a wrong turn when he realizes his ability comes in handy in the stock market, as well as blackjack. But obviously if you were in this situation, the first thing you would do is contact a Russian loan shark and take out a giant loan ... and then forget to pay it back. What? You wouldn't? Well then, don't expect to have a movie made about your life.Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) brings a wonderful visual touch to Cooper's mind and an awesome telescoping zoom rush through the streets of NYC. That was actually my favorite part of the film.The film misses quite a few opportunities to be as smart as Cooper's character is supposed to be. Either the Russian loan shark or the ultra-rich businessman played by Robert DeNiro could have led to Faustian themes that would have provided endless opportunities. Instead, we don't even get a real battle of wits between the parties. Quite a disappointment.Overall, the film is entertaining enough, but a letdown over what should have been. Watching Cooper strut and DeNiro sleepwalk are not enough for me as a movie goer.",5,57,111,20 March 2011
Beauty and the Beast," A bit dark, yet worthy
","Greetings again from the darkness. An entire generation still enjoys their childhood animated movie memories thanks to Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994). We are now a quarter-century later and Disney is looking to re-create the magic (and hopefully cash in) with Live Action versions of all three Â…as it did with Cinderella (2015) and last year's The Jungle Book (sensing a trend?). Up now is director Bill Condon's mixture of live action, CGI and music for Beauty and the Beast.The 18th century story (1740) by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve was re-written and shortened by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont after Barbot's death. Director Jean Cocteau's 1946 French film version looks to have been a key influence for this updated 'Beast', while the 2014 version with Vincent Cassel will probably now be rendered forgotten. Screenwriters Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) and Evan Spiliotopoulos (The Huntsman: Winter's War) team with Oscar winner Condon, whose musical movie resume includes Chicago and Dreamgirls, to inject some contemporary aspects to Belle's personality, as well as a bit more backstory for quite a few characters Â… all while staying true to the 1991 version.Emma Watson proves a nice choice for Belle as she has what it takes to be nice yet tough, while still being an oddball within her own community. Belle is a bookworm who dares to help other girls to read, while also being the brains behind her father's (Kevin Kline) work. She realizes her neighbors view her as a curiosity â€“ and there is even a song to prove it! Ms. Watson brings strength, independence, and courage to the role. These traits and others are on full display even before her first encounter with the beast.Dan Stevens ('Downton Abbey') is the beneficiary of an extended backstory for the Prince, which includes a large dance and musical production at the castle, leading to his being cursed for having no love in his heart. Most of the scenes with Beast utilize CGI for the face and head. This effect worked for me as I found the look fascinating and able to fulfill the necessary emotions, though the non-beast Prince would be considered the weakest link in this fairy tale chain.Since the comparisons to the 1991 version are inevitable, and certainly a matter of personal opinion, Luke Evans made a wonderfully pompous Gaston, while Josh Gad was quite humorous as LeFou, Gaston's loyal sidekick who is also the center of the misplaced controversy (not worthy of discussion here). The staff â€“ both live versions and special effects â€“ includes Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette. Each bring their own touch to the roles, with Ms. McDonald being a particular standout, and Ms. Thompson having the most thankless job as replacement for Angela Lansbury.While I found this version quite enjoyable and well done, it's a bit confusing why the decision was made to go so dark and foreboding. It's not young kid friendly at all, and seems as if the target audience is millennials who were raised on the 1991 version. This was done at the expense of inviting a new generation to explore the story and characters. Parents should probably avoid taking any kids under age 10 or 11, and the film easily could have received a PG-13 rating. 8-time Oscar winner Alan Menken returns to score the film (he did the 1991 version as well), plus he wrote new songs with Tim Rice and there are some original lyrics by Howard Ashman. With only one viewing, it's doubtful any of the new songs will be instant classics, but 'Be Our Guest' is a definite crowd-pleaser (again). Of course, it's an impossible task to please everyone when you mess with the classics, but overall, it's a nice twist for fans of the 1991 animated version. Likely a missed opportunity to bring new youngsters into the fantastical BATB world, it does show that the animated to live action transformation can be well done Â… and that's a relief with The Lion King and The Little Mermaid on the way. Dear Disney â€“ don't mess 'em up!",7,12,28,13 March 2017
Sicario," The Land of Wolves
","Greetings again from the darkness. Really good thrillers – the kind that make our palms sweat and cause us to forget to blink - are increasingly rare in the world of cinema these days. Writer Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't choose the good guys, but instead highlights the terror and lack of rules and morality that guide the border wars and drug cartels. It turns out the border isn't the only line being crossed. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) elevates Sheridan's excellent script further with a strong cast and some outstanding camera work from the best Director of Photography working today, Roger Deakins.The opening sequence is about as tense as anything we could ever hope for on screen, and it introduces us to FBI Agent Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt. We soon learn Kate is a focused and dedicated tactical expert, who also happens to be idealistic enough to believe the raids conducted by her team are making a difference  at least until this belief is later challenged.Kate quickly finds herself 'volunteering' for a special task force with muddled goals, uncertain tactics, and secretive leadership. Josh Brolin plays Matt, the leader of the team. He charms his way through answering Kate's questions without offering any substantive intel. When asked about the mission objective, Matt responds with 'to create chaos' and a smirk. Adding to her confusion and wariness is the mysterious 'consultant' Alejandro (the 'hitman' of the title) played by Benecio Del Toro. Part of the brilliance of the script is that everyone seems to know what's happening except Kate and us (the viewers)! Our understanding comes through the slow-drip method and keeps us fully engaged.Similarities to both Zero Dark Thirty and Apocalypse Now struck me as the film progressed, but the sheer number of stress-inducing sequences set this apart as something different. A family dinner with a drug lord is one of the more fascinating and tension-packed scenes of the year. The moral complexity is thought-provoking, and the abundance of corruption and politics in relation to the cartels and war on drugs, leave us wondering not just whether this war can be won, but through what methods is it being fought.'Welcome to Juarez', says Alejandro, as the SUV motorcade makes its way past the remnants of a brutal crime scene. Although there are some tremendous sequences of tactical raids (and the best traffic jam you've seen), this should not be labeled as an action film  it's so much more. Ms. Blunt's character is the conscience of the film, but it's Brolin's Matt that makes us curious as to his background and motivation. And as interesting as are those two characters, they pale in comparison to Benecio's man on a mission. Del Toro doesn't act frequently, but he possesses the gift that has him dominating the screen  forcing our eyes to follow his every movement. Rumors have a prequel in the works that will focus on Alejandro's roots. It's the 'land of wolves', and Alejandro is an alpha.Lastly, it must be stated that the film is a technical treat. The unique score from Johann Johannsson is never overbearing, and often mimics our pounding hearts. It's worth taking note. Best of all is the work of the great Roger Deakins. His photography is astounding and this could be his best work yet. The desert landscapes are just as crucial as the claustrophobic raids or the impromptu strategy sessions, and Deakins puts us right where we need to be. As a companion piece to this excellent film, I would recommend Matthew Heineman's extraordinary documentary from earlier this year, Cartel Land.",8,9,17,24 September 2015
The Descent," Good Start Gone Bad
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Neil Marshall has had some success in Great Britain, but he doesn't seem to have a feel yet for a mass audience. The set-up of the film is actually very good with a violent life-altering event and some subtle insight into our characters' personalities. Even the initial descent into the cavern is tense and kinda fun.The film really falls apart once the cave dwelling blind albino cannibals leap fast motion into the story. The critters dominate the second half of the film and really leave us feeling cheated out of a nice female update of 'Deliverance'. You will even see a touch of 'Carrie' in a couple of scenes, but I should be flogged for even mentioning those far superior films in this comment. The script, acting and direction here are not even close to that level.The best performances come from Shauna Macdonald, Natalie-Jane No one as Holly (she was great in 'The Magdalene Sisters') and Natalie Jackson Mendoza as Juno (a direct rip off of Lucy Liu).On top of all these negatives comes an ending that is just plain horrible. It leaves us feeling empty and cheated. Thrillers just can't let the audience down at the end ... especially after ruining a nice first 30 minutes.",5,0,2,21 August 2006
Some Like It Hot," Jell-O on Springs
","Greetings again from the darkness. Billy Wilder's classic was the latest in the comedy series sponsored by Dallas Film Society and Dallas Morning News. It is almost always ranked as one of the top comedy films of all-time, and often the best ever. While that's a bit higher than I would rank it, there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place in cinematic history. To fully understand the impact of the film, it helps to remind yourself of the times ... it was filmed more than 50 years ago. What we might call tame today, was incredibly risqué and daring for the times.What really stands out while watching the film is just what an incredible screen presence Marilyn Monroe possessed. It is quite challenging to take your eyes off her during any of her scenes. I am at a loss to come up with any other actor or actress who even comes close to this level of camera-cornering. Greta Garbo and Marlon Brando were great, but Marilyn is transcendent while on screen. Of course, the reports of her personal issues are legendary. Supposedly on this film, she was constantly 2-3 hours late, couldn't remember her lines and had to be coddled by all involved. Still, the final product is stunning and director Billy Wilder understood that no other actress could be substituted. Sadly, Marilyn only made two more films and was dead 3 years after this film was released.As wonderful as Marilyn is, this is really the story of Joe and Jerry, or Josephine and Daphne, or even Junior. Those five characters are all played with crackling comedy timing by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. Lemmon, as Daphne, is especially terrific as he tango's the night away with Osgood Fielding III (played by Joe E Brown). Curtis is at his best when courting Marilyn's Sugar Kane while sporting his Cary Grant impersonation and driving the boat backwards.There are so many classic comedy moments in this film, and though it is based on a 1935 French farce titled Fanfare d'Amour, Wilder and his co-writer and frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond made it their own by adding the gangster story line. Seeing notorious movie bad guy George Raft tied to the 1929 Chicago St Valentine's Day Massacre adds a dimension that many writers/directors would be unable to handle. Instead, Wilder adds his frenetic dialogue and mixes in some wild double-entendre's, a touch of Marx Brothers, and the sensuous singing of Marilyn to deliver a world class comedy.The Florida scenes were filmed at the historical Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, which remains a very popular resort location even today. Marilyn sings 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' and 'I'm Through With Love' in such a way that her character's naivety adds a dimension that breaks the heart of Joe (Curtis) and mesmerizes the viewer. Billy Wilder is certainly one of the Hollywood giants and delivered such classics as Sunset Blvd, The Apartment, Irma laDouce, and Witness for the Prosecution. His excellence spans numerous film genres, and we admire his patience and proficiency in juggling the issues required to pull off Some Like it Hot ... and avoid the fuzzy end of the lollipop.",8,3,3,12 October 2012
Inside Man," Therein Lies the Rub
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'Dog Day Afternoon' will forever be the film in which all bank heist/hostage negotiation movies will be compared. 'DDA' featured a brilliant and mesmerizing performance by Al Pacino as the bank robber. 'Inside Man' focuses less on the bank robber played by a mostly covered up Clive Owen, and more on the negotiator played by Denzel Washington.Although we see little of Clive's face (other than the opening and closing segment) he does a nice job of playing the cool as a cucumber thief with mostly his voice. Denzel plays the slightly erratic, career on the line cop, whose skills few have confidence in. Add to the mix an egotistical, intellectual mercenary played by Jodie Foster (who gets to flash her near perfect 43 year old legs), and a powerful Bank Chairman played by Christopher Plummer and director Spike Lee has quite a loaded gun with which to play.Overall the bank heist and hostage stuff is thrilling and full of suspense. The film loses a bit with the whole Christopher Plummer storyline that is really kind of hard to believe. Also, the obvious Spike Lee moments will make you cringe, but he still has a great eye for the city. The song that plays over the opening and closing credits is amazing, but most of the film score is flawed. Due to the painters uniforms and masks, very few in the supporting cast stand out, but as you can guess, Denzel is fine carrying the star power load.",6,3,4,24 March 2006
Jack Reacher," Drink from a Boot
","Greetings again from the darkness. Lee Child has written 17 Jack Reacher books since 1997, and it's a bit surprising that it took Hollywood this long to latch on to this enigmatic lone wolf drifter who doesn't so much care about laws as he does right and wrong. Fans of the books were outraged when it was announced Tom Cruise would play the 6'5 hulking Reacher, as much of the character's appeal stems from his ability to physically dominate a situation while using very few words.Unfortunately I can't ease the minds of those fans of the pulpy series, but rather to encourage them to give this a shot. Author Child was probably ecstatic when Mr. Cruise took an interest in the character, despite the obvious conflicts. Very few actors can command screen presence like Cruise, especially in action sequences. That's where this gets a bit dicey. This is not an action movie. It's an investigative mystery thriller that includes 3-4 action sequences.The film has a real 1970's feel to it along the lines of Billy Jack or Walking Tall mixed with Dirty Harry or numerous westerns with strong, silent types. See, Reacher is a former military investigator with a mind that is always a step or two ahead of everyone else. He looks at the obvious evidence and immediately notes a list of doubts where none previously existed.A seemingly random sniper attack is a bold way to begin a movie given recent real-life events, but the opening sequence is executed with methodical precision and daring so that we can quickly believe in Reacher's conspiracy theories. In the blink of an eye, Reacher has appeared out of nowhere (his usual address) and is in the middle of the investigation being conducted by the lawyer of the wrongly accused James Barr (Joseph Sikora). The defense lawyer is played by Rosamund Pike, whose character is the daughter of the District Attorney (Richard Jenkins). The police detective is played by David Oyelowo and it's easy to tell something isn't completely right with city hall.Reacher roams the beautiful city of Pittsburgh asking questions and piecing together the puzzle left behind by creepy villain The Zec (Werner Herzog) and his henchman Charlie (Jai Courtney). We get three Reacher fistfights, a 'Bullit' type car chase in a beautiful 1970 Chevelle, and some military sharp-shooting from the depths of a quarry. What we don't get is the Hollywood tradition of a Cruise sprint. Not once do we see his trademark all-out dash to or from something. In fact, he moves much like his Stacey Jaxx character from his recent musical Rock of Ages.Director Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar, and my ever-lasting respect, for his 'The Usual Suspects' screenplay. This story is infinitely less-complicated, but it does offer some fun moments thanks to the Reacher character. Maybe things would be a little better if a guy like Reacher really existed. Totally off the grid and taking down the bad guys that the cops can't quite catch. Sounds a bit like 'Dexter', only Reacher's code includes doling out physical pain and then moving on to the next town ... with a new set of Goodwill duds and a fresh toothbrush.Caleb Deschanel (Director of Photography) provides a really sharp look to the film and, thankfully, doesn't cheat on the action scenes. Herzog (a highly respected director) has a great look for a bad guy, but is painfully under-utilized here. Rosamund Pike may simply be my least favorite actress working today. Her limited range is cringe-worthy on multiple occasions and I was thankful that Reacher had no 'interest' in her. Robert DuVall makes a colorful appearance as the late-arriving character that breaks open the case, and he seems to relish the reunion with his 'Days of Thunder' co-star. The most interesting character to me was Jai Courtney, who will be seen next as Bruce Willis' son in 'A Good Day to Die Hard'.If you haven't read the Lee Child books, you will probably readily accept Cruise as Reacher. If you are a fan of the franchise, your eyes and brain will have massive conflicts for the first hour, but then acceptance creeps in, and you'll probably agree that it's a simple, effective piece of entertainment ... far superior to most Nicolas Cage movies these days!

"McFarland, USA"," This ain't Golf
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'A Disney movie' was once synonymous with good-hearted family fare. Even though the lure of big box office has caused the studio to expand their film boundaries a bit, no one does it better when the material is a heart-warming, inspiring story  especially if based on a true story. This latest has less in common with The Mighty Ducks, and more with Miracle, The Rookie, and Dreamer.Based on a true story that began in 1987, Kevin Costner plays high school coach Jim White, who after a couple of unfortunate incidents, finds himself with a not so desirable teaching/coaching gig in the San Joaquin Valley in central California – specifically the poverty stricken farming community of McFarland. To say that life is hard in McFarland is a bit of an understatement. The families are mostly Hispanic and heavily dependent on crop picking. Once the kids are age 10, they are put to work in the fields before and after school.Toting their prejudices, Coach White and his wife (Maria Bello) and two daughters arrive as outsiders, but quickly discover their neighbors are very proud people who value family and community. Coach also discovers that the area boys have developed a natural ability to run distances in the heat, so he forms a school cross country team, and the rest is literally history. The runners dominate the California state meet by winning 9 of the next 14 years, and many of the boys go off to college – something previously not even a remote dream for most.Since this is Disney, most of the jagged edges are rounded off. Crime, discrimination, politics, racism, and poverty are present, but do not receive much attention. Director Niko Caro (Whale Rider, North Country) does nice work in keeping the story grounded and focused on the individuals. We get a feel for the skepticism and family obstacles faced by this first group of runners. More importantly, we witness the pride and involvement as the boys begin to have some success, and the sense of belonging that sneaks up on White and his family.Costner does get a shot at a motivational speech, but it's small in scope and wonderfully centered on what the boys have accomplished, rather than some unrelatable shot at changing the world. Seeing him on a 'Barbie' bike brings a laugh, as does some of the high school boy chatter directed at their duck-out-of-water coach. We don't really get to know the individual boys too much (some are actors, some are actual McFarland students), but the end credit video recap of where they are now (27 years later) really hits home as to the importance of guidance and mentorship for youngsters.The film is extremely pleasant and the story's roots in the real world lend credence to the inspirational message and underdog-overcoming-obstacles story. It's also a reminder that opportunity to make a difference is all around us. Just look what Jim White and runners have accomplished!",6,37,66,18 February 2015
Les Misérables," Master of the House
","Greetings again from the darkness. One of the most anticipated films of the year is the first from director Tom Hooper since his Oscar winning 'The King's Speech'. It also happens to be based on one of the true literary classics by Victor Hugo (first published 1862). Oh yes, it is presented as a true musical ... the dialogue is sung and story advanced through forty-something songs. The latter feature gives it more of an opera feel than the stage version I saw more than 20 years ago.The biggest question and curiosity going in was whether the cast of top notch movie stars could hold their own vocally. Sure, Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean) is a Tony winner, Anne Hathaway (Fatine) has some Broadway chops of her own, Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) sang in 'Mamma Mia', and Russell Crowe (Javert) has toured with his own band. But this is a whole new challenge, as director Hooper decided to have the actors sing 'live' during filming, providing a more intimate feel to the film. Throw in two exceptionally strong vocal performances from Eddie Redmayne (Marius) and Samantha Barks (Eponine) and only the harshest critics will claim the singing disappoints.'Seinfeld' fans will enjoy the comic relief from thieving innkeepers Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as they take advantage of their customers while belting out 'Master of the House'. It's pure joy to hear Colin Wilkinson's voice as The Bishop who offers Valjean his chance for redemption. Mr. Wilkinson is legendary as the original Valjean in the London and New York stage versions from the mid-80's.There were a few things that distracted me at times. The most annoying being the incessant facial close-up on every song. This is typically a device to cover-up weak set design, but here the sets are spectacular and really capture the nastiness of 19th century France. And while I certainly enjoyed Ms. Hathaways' show-stopping 'I Dreamed a Dream', I found her overall acting to be quite distracting during her few scenes. Russell Crowe's physical presence perfectly captures the omnipresent Javert, though the lack of punch in his vocals prevented the boom needed in a couple of songs. Lastly, Mr. Jackman seemed to strain on the high notes in my favorite 'Bring him Home', though again, none of these things ruined the experience for me.As with most film musicals, the best approach is just to allow the story and songs to wash over you ... don't dwell on the minor issues. Keep in mind that this is a powerful and interesting production thanks to Victor Hugo's source material. It's a privilege to enjoy a first rate presentation seen through new eyes and heard through new vocalists.",7,0,1,30 December 2012
The Da Vinci Code," An Apple and the Rose
","Greetings again from the darkness. It does seem as if everyone has read Dan Brown's book and of course, rarely does a movie based on a quality novel ever measure up. Although there are exceptions, Ron Howard's version of 'The DaVinci Code' is not one of them. For fans of the book, there are wonderful moments of awe and recognition. However, there are more moments of mediocrity, even near boredom. In other words, the visual presentation offers nothing new, save for some wonderful shots inside and out of historic buildings and churches.The casting of Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou seemed perfect, but the execution is lackluster at best. Neither brings any energy to their part and the lines are spoken as if dress rehearsal is the NEXT step. Hanks in particular appears lackadaisical and really doesn't fit the Harvard professor role. Ian McKellen brings a much needed lift to the movie when his Teabing finally appears. Jean Reno is solid as Fache and Alfred Molina is fine as the Bishop. As in the novel, Silas (played well by Paul Bettany) is by far the most interesting character. The guy is definitely committed to his cause.Despite the beautiful scenery and historic shots, it is with regret that I report the film just doesn't do justice to a colorful and exciting novel. Yes, the book is an easy read and it seemed to move much faster than the movie. It will be interesting to see how those who have not read the book react to the presentation and if they are able to follow along. So many details are skipped and Howard evidently assumes the viewer will know what has already happened and why the story has jumped ahead.Howard's last outing, 'Cinderella Man' was sadly ignored by movie-goers, but I fear this one will be crucified. Let's hope his next outing, a remake of 'East of Eden' will be his breakout.",6,2,5,20 May 2006
Titanic," A Mathematical Certainty
","Greetings again from the darkness. Of course I saw this one a couple of times when it was first released in 1997. Having only watched it once since, I was happy to hear it would get a re-release on its 15th anniversary ... even if the marketing hook was the post-production 3D. My thought was with James Cameron working his technical magic, the 3D would be fine, and maybe even add to the spectacle of the sinking ship. After all, he was the mastermind behind Avatar, which with Hugo, are the only two films (in my opinion) that haven't been weakened with 3D technology.Unfortunately, I can't overstate my disappointment in the 3D for Titanic. The colors and lighting are destroyed. When we first see young Rose (Kate Winslet) arrive to board the majestic ocean liner, her lavender hat appears almost gray through the 3D glasses. And later, the crimson Renault, where Rose and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) get to 'know' each other, appears dull and darkened. Additionally so many face shots are darkened, rather than illuminated by the beautiful fixtures that adorn Titanic. I was so saddened to see such dullness on top of such greatness. Sure, there were a couple of times where the 3D gave a boost to a special effect, but the film is so beautifully made and such a technical marvel, that the impact is minimal to the positive.What I will say is that despite my frustration with the technology, I do hope a new generation is introduced to the film. Personally, I am no fan of the love story between Jack and Rose. However, it is such a delight to see the young, eager versions of Little Leo and Kate as they go about their antics. They were 22 and 21 respectively during filming, and we now know them as mature actors and major movie stars. That wasn't the case when Titanic first premiered.The real genius of this film is two fold: the story-telling and the technical achievement. Gloria Stuart stars as 101 yr old Rose and she is used to perfection in telling the personal story of Titanic. Her love story with Jack allows director Cameron to show off the amazing ship from all angles ... first class, third class, dining rooms and engine rooms. She also allows the viewer to connect with the characters on a personal level. The technical aspect is even more astounding. Sets, models, CGI, and documentary footage are all blended to form a cohesive presentation of one of the most dramatic events of the past 100 years.Here are a few notes of interest regarding the movie and those involved. The movie was number one at the box office for 15 consecutive weeks and grossed more than $1.8 billion ... a record that stood until Cameron's Avatar eclipsed it. Cameron was already an established sci-fi director with Terminator I & II and Aliens, but he almost had the plug pulled by the production company due to cost overruns. Matthew McConaughey was the producer's first choice for Jack, but Cameron held firm for DiCaprio. The elderly couple hugging each other in bed as the ship sinks were based on the Strauss' who owned the Macy's department store chain. And yes, there were Astor's and Guggenheim's onboard when it went down. If you have seen the movie before, pay particular attention to the secondary characters ... the wardrobes and acting are tremendous: Francis Fisher as Rose's mother, Karthy Bates as the 'Unsinkable' Molly Brown, Billy Zane as the fiancé, David Warner as his henchman, Bernard Hill as the Captain, Victor Garber as the architect, and Jonathan Hyde as the sleazy ship owner. Also catch Suzy Amis in one of her last acting jobs before becoming Mrs. James Cameron ... she plays the granddaughter to 'old' Rose.This is an historic film version of an historic event and should be seen by all movie lovers. Some of it is a bit hokey, but if you doubt the technical achievement, compare it to A Night to Remember, the 1958 version of the Titanic story.",8,2,4,7 April 2012
In Time," Hey Buddy, Can You Spare Some Time?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Now this is a terrific premise for a sci-fi story. You have surely heard the phrase: Time is Money. Well in this world, Time is not just money, it is Life itself. Time is everything ... and it's displayed for all to see via a neon green counter on everyone's forearm.The film has an odd look. Vehicles look like modernized versions of 1970's classics, but fashion and other technology seems basically unchanged. Society is divided more severely than today. but the commentary is clear.All people live until 25 at which time they stop aging and the clock starts. They are given ONE year and are free to earn, gamble or spend their time ... heck, some even gamble. When your clock hit Zero, you drop dead immediately. So, the working class is isolated in time zones, running from place to place and taking extra shifts at the plant to pay the rent. The rich live in Connecticut and try to find ways to leisurely spend their days that will never end.Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, one of the poor ones. In a scene that will have you scratching your head, Olivia Wilde plays his mom (remember, you stop aging at 25). Will has a chance meeting with Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who has lived more than 100 years and still has more than a century left. After a deep, philosophical conversation, Will ends up with Henry's time and is a suspect in his murder.Will runs off to Connecticut and is pursued by the Timekeeper Police led by Cillian Murphy. Will ends up in the lavish home of Philippe Weiss (Vincent Katheiser from Mad Men) and falls for his daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). They end up on the lam and turn into the ultimate Time Bandits ... Robin Hood who steals time from the rich and distributes to the poor.While the premise is promising, some of the best stuff is left untouched. Henry Hamilton would have been a fascinating character to get a little more backstory on. Cillian Murphy's character is obviously talented and a bit burned out. It's a bit disconcerting to see most of the people in a movie to look all about the same age, but that's a very cool product of this society. As is the 'big board' of time that looks eerily similar to the Stock Market boards we see that track movement every moment of the day. Time is precious and is of course watched over.Writer/director Andrew Niccol also brought us Gattaca and Lord of War. I would have liked this one to go a bit deeper, but it's fun to watch Timberlake and Seyfried playing Bonnie and Clyde. Thinking about this from a monetary standpoint is pretty interesting, but it also reminds us that there's never enough time!",6,4,10,30 October 2011
Thor," Hammertime
","Greetings again from the darkness. Upfront admission: I am not a Thor comic book expert. Many people are and I fully appreciate their take on this film will be much different from mine. I can only judge this movie on the basic background knowledge I have and the final product on the screen.Let's start with the good stuff. Chris Hemsworth makes a terrific Thor. If I had his looks and build, I would certainly consider myself a Nordic God. Heck, I might even carry around a hammer just for fun! Thor, son of Odin, is all set to be named King of Asgard until his quick-temper and love of battle cause a break in the peace accord with the Frost Giants. His dad, Odin, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins is none too pleased with his hot-headed son. Not only does he renege on the promise to name him King, but he strips his power and casts him down to Earth ... specifically New Mexico. For some reason, all alien portals lead to New Mexico. You can tell it's a been a bad day for Thor because he lands in the middle of nowhere and is promptly run over by a science lab van driven by Natalie Portman.Other good stuff: Idris Elba as Heimdall, the gatekeeper, is excellent; there is a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye - a teaser for The Avengers movie next year; Jamie Alexander shows some chops as Sif; Clark Gregg is back as Agent Coulson; some of the special effects are pretty cool ... the Frost Giants are very detailed and The Destroyer looks like Iron Man on metallic steroids; and lastly, Kat Dennings has a couple of sharp lines as Portman's assistant. Ms. Dennings was superb in 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist'.OK, the not so good stuff: I am beginning to despise 3-D (it adds nothing, while diminishing the brightness of colors); Jotunheim (land of the Frost Giants) is just plain, gray and boring; Natalie Portman, fresh off an Oscar is just terrible as an astro-physicist with a teenage crush on Thor; Tom Hiddleston as Loki is one of the weakest villains I have ever seen in a super-hero/comic book movie; Rene Russo must not have read the script prior to accepting her role - she has about 3 lines and is totally wasted.Despite the weaknesses, I found the movie to be entertaining enough thanks to the scenes with Thor and Odin. The ambitious son being shown tough love by his father is a missing element in much of society today. Guess it takes a Nordic God to show us how. The scenes with Portman are painful to watch, but I believe there is enough to keep the comic book fans and just about anyone else entertained.Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is best known for his Shakespeare and stage work, the movie does have a little different look and feel from the average superhero movie. Still, I wouldn't put it in the class of Batman, Spider-man, or Iron Man. We do get the expected Stan Lee cameo and the end-of-the-credits appearance of Samuel L Jackson. Up next, Captain America!",6,0,1,15 May 2011
The Happening," Try and Catch the Wind
","Greetings again from the darkness. Even in his less successful films, writer/director M Night Shyamalan usually delivers a thought-provoking, unique looking final product. This one, while not one of his better efforts, is no exception.Roger Ebert fell in love with the insight shown by the characters in the midst of a wake-up call from nature. I say it is a terrific premise, and one most of us have at least thought about, yet it falls way short of showing us the insight of people into their own lives. Granted the dialog is limited, but most of these people just seemed dazed and confused.None of the sub-plots are well developed and we are left to do most of the thinking and consideration ourselves. The talented director really just throws the idea out there. Actually, very little happens other than a few people are frozen in time until they walk backwards and harm themselves. The film does come alive briefly during the segments with Ft Worth's own Betty Buckley as Mrs. Jones, one of the most bizarre senior citizens whom could ever hope to encounter.With all the missed opportunities and 'inside jokes' like the nursery owner (Frank Collison) proclaiming his love of hot dogs, this one borders on boring rather than melancholy. Sadly Zooey Deschanel and Mark Wahlberg show little in their roles and John Leguizamo's sniveling role is an embarrassment for all men and his judgment is certainly outside the realm of reasonable. Don't miss Spencer Breslin's (Abigail's brother) brief, but fun role.All said, this would have made a better Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode since Night refused to work too hard on this one.",4,2,7,15 June 2008
The Shape of Water," beautiful film, creature, performances
","Greetings again from the darkness. Recent release THE JUSTICE LEAGUE is filled with superheroes, but filmmaker-extraordinaire Guillermo del Toro finds his league of misfits and outcasts to be much more interesting - as do I. The numerous possible descriptions of this movie are all accurate, yet alone, each falls short: a fairy tale, fable, monster movie, unconventional romance, sci-fi, cold war saga, and commentary on societal misfits. What is also true is that it's a gorgeous film with terrific performances, and it pays lovely tribute to the classics. A government research facility in 1962 Baltimore is the setting, and 'The Asset' being secured and studied is an amphibious creature that was captured in South America by a sadistic Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) and his electric cattle prod. Now the military, and a 5- star General played by Nick Searcy, is in charge. The lead scientist played by Michael Stuhlbarg certainly has a different agenda than the military, whose focus seems to be more on preventing the Russians (closer than you think) from stealing the asset than in actually seizing the rare scientific opportunity for advancement.While all the ominous and clandestine government operations are being conducted, a member of the nighttime cleaning crew - a mute woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) – makes a very personal connection with the creature through nutritious snacks, Big Band music and sign language. This is the enchanting portion of the story and is admittedly (by del Toro) inspired by the 1954 classic CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (a personal favorite of mine). Elisa and the creature experience a romantic courtship not unlike what we have seen in many other love stories  that is, if you overlook the amphibious being that makes up half of this couple. In fact, 'going with' the story is crucial to one's enjoyment. Sit back and let the magic and wonder and fantastical nature of del Toro's imagination sweep you away – just as it has done for Elisa.There are many elements of the film worth exploring, and it's likely to take another viewing to capture many of them. The band of misfits is comprised of the creature (Doug Jones), Elisa (Ms. Hawkins), Elisa's wise and wise-cracking co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and Elisa's neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay graphics design artist. These are the nice folks/beings who make up the world that seems to be run by bullies and predators (sound familiar?). There is even a religious debate here as it's mentioned that the creature was treated by a God in his natural environment, and a brief discussion is had over what might a God look like. All of the actors are superb, and Miss Hawkins delivers her second knockout performance of the year (the other being MAUDIE).'The future' is a central theme of the story, though Elisa is most focused on now – how to find some happiness in a world that has been so challenging. Elisa realizes she and the creature are more similar than not, and she feels his pain each time the power-hungry Strickland (Shannon) pops him with the electric cattle prod. There is an ethereal beauty (and yes, sensuality) to the scenes with Elisa and the creature, and it even leads to a terrific song ('You'll Never Know' by Renee Fleming) and dance dream sequence. In addition, you'll notice many nods and tributes to classics such as Mr. Ed, Dobie Gillis, Betty Grable, Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson and Shirley Temple, and Carmen Miranda singing 'Chica Chica Boom Chic'. It's also no accident that the apartments of Elisa and Giles are located directly above a palatial old movie theatre that is struggling to make ends meet. All of these pieces are tied together as Mr. del Toro honors the art forms he so adores.For those who enjoy such detail, it should be noted that the color green plays a huge role throughout the film  the water, the creature, the uniforms, the furniture, the walls – even the Jello, the pie and Strickland's (teal) Cadillac. The use of color ties in the ever- present mythology, and the theme of meanness and power versus kindness and love.Cinematographer Dan Laustsen adds to the magical feel with his camera work and lighting that perfectly complements the characters and tone. Oscar winning composer Alexandre Desplat delivers yet another spot on score that not only syncs with story, but also the numerous classic songs included. Guillermo det Toro is one of the most creative and inventive contemporary filmmakers, and though this one may fall a tick below his masterpiece PAN'S LABRYNTH, it is sure to dazzle and mesmerize those who give it a chance  and let's hope there are many who do!",8,25,47,7 December 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Matrix - warp speed version
","Greetings again from the darkness.  The Wachowski brothers understand what made The Matrix a hit, so they went to their lab and delivered a reved-up version that tries desperately to be a drama in addition to an action/special effects movie.  Too bad the story is so weak.  However, fans will probably not be disappointed by the action sequences.  Keanu Reeves and the brilliant Hugo Weaving face-off in some virtual gang rumble that is so fast it is difficult to keep up with your eyes.  Thought Weaving (Agent Smith) was one of the best things about the first movie - but he suffers from overexposure in the sequel.  Lawrence Fishbourne and Carrie-Anne Moss are perfect in recapturing their characters.  MANY MANY new characters are introduced.  Actually too many.  Jada Pinkett Smith has a nice turn in a role that could have been developed.  The stunning Monica Bellucci (Tears of the Sun) provides some eye candy, even boxer Roy Jones, jr has a brief role. Best surprise was seeing Anthony Zerbe, a TV staple in the 60's and 70's, who is just not seen much these days.  Overall, thought the CGI was a bit heavy at times, but the fight sequences remain ultra cool.  Make sure you stay until the end of the incredibly long credits segment at the end.  By the way, what is Dave Matthews doing singing a song for a special effects movie?",6,0,1,16 May 2003
The Fountain," The Road to Awe
","Greetings again from the darkness. Interesting, open to interpretation film from the brilliant mind of writer/director Darren Aronofsky. The film spans over 1000 years, but the three stories are presented in a non-linear manner so as to encourage thought and discussion. The whole topic of everlasting life or death as a disease could and has filled numerous research papers. Mr. Aronofsky brings his unique visual element to the topics.The two leads are played well enough by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Jackman's look spans that of Mick Fleetwood as a conquistador, TV's Dr. House in the present, and the zen of David Carradine in the future. Regardless of the era, he spends the entire film extremely agitated with a constant frown. Weisz, on the other hand, makes a lovely queen, a perky dying lady and sickly tree. Supporting help is provided by Ellen Burstyn (making up for her horrible turn in 'The Wicker Man') and the powerful Stephen McHattie as The Inquistor.Each story has a frenetic pace and the climax of Jackman discovering 'The Fountain' is pretty well done. This one doesn't score higher due to lack of connection to the two main characters in any period of time. We just aren't really given any reason to care.Although not in the class of 'PI' and certainly not the excellence of 'Requiem for a Dream', Mr. Aronofsky delivers another thought provoking visual feast that will be loved by many and hated by some.",6,0,3,25 November 2006
Mystic River," 'Good to see you Theo'
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I walked out of this movie feeling cheated. It had almost nothing to do with 'Mystic River', but everything to do with Sean Penn.  This guy is such a great actor that I feel cheated he doesn't work more often.  He is Deniro from 15-20 years ago, before Deniro started parodying himself (SNL and Meet the Parents). Director Clint Eastwood delivers what we have come to expect from him - a wonderfully crafted, beautiful film that we mostly surrender to from our theatre seats.  Eastwood's style make you feel like you are a passenger on a car trip, watching as things happen outside your window.  'Mystic River' is not a whodunnit, as the answer to that question is given away very early on. What it is a study in human frailty, no matter the form.  The 3 childhood friends grow to be quite different adults, yet the horrific incident they share, is the foundation for who they have become.  While Sean Penn should act more often, I believe Tim Robbins (a fine filmmaker in his own right) should act less.  In goes through his role as some psycho-Herman Munster. Yes, he is tortured by the childhood incident, but if reality is such a foreign place to him, wouldn't his wife or co-workers have suggested therapy?  His role, while crucial to the film, had the weakest structure and performance.  Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn, on the other hand, shine in their roles.  For one of the few times, Bacon is not playing some freak that we love to hate.  Eastwood (in the Woody Allen tradition) has assembled a cast of acting professionals.  Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden all lend realism to their tough roles.  Spencer Treat Clark (the kid from 'Unbreakable' and 'Gladiator') has a key role without uttering a word. What a joy to see Eli Wallach (Eastwood's buddy from 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) as the liquor store owner and witness to a past crime ... although he should have been listed in the credits!  Bottom line on this one, enjoy as a personality study and beautiful film and not a murder whodunnit.",7,0,1,26 October 2003
Mystic River," Good to see you, Theo
","Greetings again from the darkness.  The first thing that hit me after this movie is, why doesn't Sean Penn make more movies?  He reminds of Deniro from 10-15 years ago.  Very powerful screen presence and so much emotion without the hystronics of lessor actors.  The next thing is that this is no whodunnit!  The answer to that is given away very early in the process, so for me it became a study of blue collar northeastern family and friendship. Very strong ties for this area.  No other geographic part of the U.S. compares.  Watching the Savage brothers 'serve' Penn's character is chilling, all the while knowing he would do the same for them, if the tables were turned.  Other than the lack of suspense for the killer, the film's next biggest flaw is Timothy Robbins.  He tromps around like a psycho-Herman Munster.  I never believe this is a grown-up version of the boy who survived the tragic childhood incident.  In every scene, Robbins is over the top and almost laughably awful.  The incident itself actually seems secondary to how the 3 boys grow into adults.  What could have been the defining storyline is actually a weakness in the script.  All that said, Clint Eastwood again directs a beautiful piece of filmmaking.  His pace, color and music is near incomparable.  Only Scorcese is better.  First movie in awhile where Kevin Bacon is actually not some idiot in an unbelievable situation.  As a police detective, he turns in a very realistic cop in a tough situation.  His partner, Laurence Fishburne, is at times too aggressive, but it plays well against Bacon's pent up frustration with the case and his wife.   What a joy to see Eli Wallach (Clint's buddy from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) as a years-later witness to a liquor store hold-up.  Spencer Treat Clark (the kid from Unbreakable and Gladiator) has a key non-speaking role and Marcia Gay Harden performs well as the what to do wife of Robbin's character. Although, seemingly out of place, I really enjoyed super-actress Laura Linney's final two scenes.  The bedroom scene with Sean Penn was very powerful and her exceedingly cold stare down of Harden at the parade gave me the willies!!  It almost seems there must have been another Linney scene left on the cutting room floor, as her character gave no indication of this inner strength prior to this.  Overall, another well made Eastwood movie with a weak script and terrific acting by Penn and Linney.",7,0,1,27 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard's best direction so far
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Masterful moviemaking can look so easy as a finished product.  Ron Howard seems to be peaking as a movie maker. Still though, he continues to get caught up in melodrama, but much less so in this fine film.  Mumbling Russell Crowe is outstanding (again) as the brilliant, but haunted Dr. John Nash.  Jennifer Connelly stands toe-to-toe with Crowe in every scene.  If you are unfamiliar with Connelly's work, check out 'The Hot Spot'.  It's a sleeper with Don Johnson and Virginia Madsen.  WOW!  As usual, Ron Howard has produced a few interesting notes. He has regular appearance of family members, including veteran actor dad, Rance.  Also, note the brief appearance of super-casting director (more than 100 films) of Jane Jenkins.  Regular film-goers will easily recognize her name.  This movie is not your typical bio pic.  This movie is about mental illness and both Nash's brave attempt to fight the disease with as little medication as possible.  This film makes a statement that disease is often too quickly treated with pills and not compassion, support and grit. Wonderful supporting roles by Christopher Plummer and the under-utilized Judd Hirsch make this a truly masterful picture.  Some of Ed Harris's scenes were overblown, but probably had to be to make the point they were making. Very few light moments in this one, but a must see.",8,0,2,30 December 2001
The Departed," What's the Difference?
","Greetings again from the darkness. I will admit it upfront. It is very rare that I don't enjoy/appreciate/respect Martin Scorcese films. What I will say to his detractors is this is his best work since 'Goodfellas'. Yes it is based on the 2002 Hong Kong film entitled 'Infernal Affairs', and Scorcese is so respectful that he actually notes this in the closing credits.Prepare for a a no-holds-barred all out blazing explosion of film making! And so much fun to watch. If the 'f' word bothers you, stay home. It may rival any Tarantino flick for harsh, but real in-this-world language. If violence bothers you, stay home. There are some moments of extremely brutal and realistic violence and bloodshed. On the other hand, if you are a fan of complex story lines, amazing cinematography, top level acting and crackling dialogue, rush out now to see this film.Oh my ... the acting is as good as it gets (pun intended) with Jack Nicholson as the personification of EVIL as Mob boss Frank Costello. This is a very bad man and Jack is in his element. Sure the guy is a great actor and can pull off fluff like insomnia with Diane Keaton, but this is the Jack that we have loved for decades. He literally spews venom with his lines and facial expressions. Matt Damon, back in his Boston comfort zone (remember 'Good Will Hunting') pulls off the role of informant with a truly believable lack of conscience that will hit you in the gut. Now what to say about Leonardo DiCaprio? I promise to never call him 'Little Leo' again! He is now a man and flashes the acting maturity that Scorcese has been pushing him towards for a few years. Sure, he steals some mannerisms from DeNiro (watch him flick a cigarette) but his simmering emotions are plastered on his face throughout and trust me when I say, this dude has a LOT of emotion!.As is Scorcese's custom, the supporting actors are also solid, believable and disappear into their roles. A bloated, washed-out Alec Baldwin is remarkable. Martin Sheen is fine and Mark Wahlberg had to be laughing out loud when he first read his lines ... I know I was! Few could pull off three or four of Wahlberg's hilarious lines without sounding like a stand-up comedian instead of a wily, veteran cop. Also fun to watch is relative newcomer Vera Farmiga who falls for both Leonardo and Damon in what is one of the few story lines that could have been better developed.Toss in Scorcese's legendary pacing and camera action, an eclectic soundtrack that somehow combines the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison singing Pink Floyd ('Comfortably Numb'), Badfinger and Dvorcak, and the most complex use of cell phones yet, and you have one amazing film that will keep you glued to the screen. A bit of warning ... there is no good time for a potty break during this 2 1/2 hour film so don't buy the large drink!",9,2,5,6 October 2006
Glory Road," Fundamental Movie
","Greetings again from the darkness. If you are looking for a history lesson on the truly amazing story of Don Haskins and his 1966 Texas Western basketball championship team, then the closest you will get is the closing credits which feature quotes from Don Haskins, Pat Reilly and the real TWU players. If you are in the mood for a feel-good, underdog story presented in full Jerry Bruckheimer mode then 'Glory Road' aims to please.First time director James Gartner shows some attention to detail but admittedly takes some creative license while presenting the story of the first all black team to win a NCAA championship. Of course the team was not all black, but coach Don Haskins made the decision to play only black players in this historic game. The best part of the film is watching Josh Lucas as Don Haskins and Jon Voight as Adolph Rupp stalk the sidelines during the big game. Lucas with his gut and mannerisms and Voight with his pompous poses really capture the essence of the public image of these two men. Also, Red West (former Elvis bodyguard) does a nice job as Ross.There are many other parts I don't really understand. Emily Deschanel is totally wasted as Haskins' wife. Most of the black players look at least 5 years too old for college. In fact, Derek Luke ('Antwone Fisher') is almost 32 years old. Also, the time frame for Haskins at Texas Western is quite misleading. None of those really matter in a glossy Hollywood production, but they do matter when presenting history.Nothing at all wrong with the crowd-pleasing, root-for-the-underdog movie, although it is a bit frustrating when it deals so lightly with historic facts. Also, don't miss Don Haskins as the gas station attendant who asks Lucas is he wants his tank filled up and definitely stay for the closing credits.",6,1,10,15 January 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Nightmare on Black & Decker Street
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Michael Bay is to film what Scott Boras is to Baseball. And that ain't good. This is just a loud cartoon of a movie with some of the worst dialogue ever uttered by an upright man or machine.The key players are back. Shia LeBeouf, Megan Fox and John Tuturro pick up their battle against evil and somehow survive when others get easily mangled and killed. After the first 4 or 5 hours I began to just laugh each time they managed to re-do Megan Fox' make-up in the middle of an action sequence. Yes, I realize this isn't supposed to be Saving Private Ryan, but how many pouty poses would most people have if they were in any of these situations.Shia's parents, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, play a big role in the attempts at humor ... including some lame ass 1970's joke about 'green' brownies. ugh.",3,7,17,27 June 2009
The Witch," Bad Bunny
","Greetings again from the darkness. If your own nightmares have become less frequent, and you find yourself able to sleep peacefully through the night, writer/director Robert Eggers' first feature film will likely fix that. Based in 1630 New England Â… a full 60 years prior to the Salem witch trials Â… much of the story and dialogue is based on actual historical documents corresponding to the fears of that era. It would be a mistake to head into this one thinking it's going to having you covering your eyes or springing from your seat Â… it's better described as unsettling and disquieting.Religious fanaticism plays a key role here, and is actually behind a Puritan family being exiled from the community. They set up a home and farm on the edge of an ominous, heavily-wooded forest Â… and things start to go wrong. William (Ralph Ineson) and Katherine (Kate Dickie) are stern and stoic parental units to coming-of-age teenager Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), her younger brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), two spoiled and annoying twins Mercy (Ellie Granger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), and a new born named Samuel.This is a slow-burn psychological horror film and it never relies on cheap jump-scares. Instead the eerie atmosphere, lurking Satanic evil, and unraveling of the family as they search for answers, all combine for a level of creep that's not often seen on screen. Adding to our pre-conceived notion that things rarely end well for closed-mind religious zealots is the unsettling use of Old World English Â… it takes some time to adjust your ears.Most of director Eggers' background is in short films with an emphasis on Production Design and Costume Design. It's interesting to note the gradual decline of lighting as the movie progresses Â… most notably on the opening and closing shots of daughter Thomasin, who faces the most backlash as a suspected (by her family) witch.This was a time when people prayed for food and for God to have mercy Â… and to explain the unexplainable. No amount of praying can make sense of the titular witch (Bathsheba Garnett), or the family's goat Black Phillip (voiced by Wahab Chaudhry), or an evil bunny that would make Monty Python proud. The dingo taking their baby might actually be a preferred explanation.Eggers won the Sundance Award for a Director in Drama, and the film was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize. Mark Korven's score is unique and the perfect complement to the on screen happenings of this poor family. The film stays true to the time period, which of itself, feels like a parallel universe unfamiliar to most of us these days. Young actors Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw are real finds, and director Eggers will have a built-in and well-deserved audience for his next outing.",7,11,26,18 February 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Classic Roman
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Took advantage of the re-release of this Polanski classic with a family trip to the Magnolia Theatre.  Tremendous script with Polanski at his finest with creepy camera angles and lighting. Really paid attention to the performances this time and came away with even greater admiration for the one and only Ruth Gordan and her on screen husband Sidney Blackmer.  Even Mia Farrow's performance was better than I remembered.  Cassavetes was a bit stiff, but Maurice Evans was terrific. Fun to see a young Charles Grodin.  Yeah, there is a ton of interesting background info with the connections between Polanski/Farrow, Farrow/Sinatra, Polanski/Sharon Tate (who appears briefly in this one) and the subsequent horrific tale of the Charles Manson clan.  In spite of that, this is a wonderful film.",9,2,2,23 May 2003
Jersey Boys," Rag (doll) to Riches
","Greetings again from the darkness. Two upfront disclosures are in order. I have never seen the mega-smash Broadway show, and I've always been a huge fan of The Four Seasons' music. These are pertinent because they impact one's reaction to the film version.Director Clint Eastwood knew immediately he wanted to bring the Broadway show to the movies. In fact, his decision to cast 3 of the 4 main stage actors proved crucial in this successful transition. The rags-to-riches story of four guys from New Jersey is not only true, but it's believable because they scrap and battle just like we would expect. The mob ties are on full display, as is the struggle to maintain any semblance of normal family life while on the rocket ship to stardom.John Lloyd Young is spectacular as the great Frankie Valli. While I fully anticipated cringing during the songs, his voice never once faltered. He is clearly the main reason the Broadway show (he won a Tony award) and the movie work. Erich Bergen plays songwriter Bob Gaudio and Michael Lomenda plays bassist Nick Massi ... both are solid. The only crack was in the casting of Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito. Piazza is well known from 'Boardwalk Empire', but he is just a bit too slick as the guy who scammed the other band members, digging a massive hole of debt - mostly to a mob loan shark named Norm Waxman (played by Donnie Kehr in an excellent performance).Other support work is provided by Mike Doyle as record producer and all-around flamboyant guy, Bob Crewe; Renee Marino starts strong as Mary (Frankie's future wife) but is given little to do as the story progresses; Joseph Russo captures the quirks of a young Joe Pesci, who introduces Gaudio to the band; and the always entertaining Christopher Walken slightly underplays local made guy Gyp DeCarlo who is instrumental in protecting Frankie in those early years. It should also be noted that the band's accountant is played by Barry Livingston, who you might remember as Ernie from 'My Three Son's'.Eastwood is now 84 years old and he wisely takes a pretty conventional route with the film version. In fact, the argument could be made that taming the language could have resulted in a PG-13 rating, making it more accessible to families. It doesn't have the edge that most R movies possess. This movie has not been popular with critics and it's probably because of this relatively safe approach to an entertaining and fun story. It's not cutting edge cinema, but if you enjoy the music, you will enjoy the movie.",6,13,18,30 June 2014
The Holiday," Lacking Gumption
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Nancy Meyers has always written her stories from purely a female perspective and because of this, she has had a very successful box office career in film ('Something's Gotta Give', 'Father of the Bride', 'Baby Boom' 'Private Benjamin'). What is always lacking in her stories is any type of balance between the genders. 'The Holiday' lags behind even the other films listed because here we are not even shown women with 'gumption' (an ongoing gag in the film).The formula here is two women, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, who are both successful professionals, but a mess in their personal lives. Perfect strangers, they agree to a two week house switch (L.A. and England) to escape their own lives. Yada, Yada, Yada, they find themselves and the love of their lives. Who would have guessed? Meyers basically castrates the Jude Law character (Diaz' love interest). He is as close to a woman as any non-trans-gendered man can get. Then for some unknown reason she casts physical comedian Jack Black as Winslet's dream boat. Then she evidently directed him to 'act like Jack Black on valium'. He tries to be funny, but mostly he just looks like a lame Jack Black impersonator. Not much to say about Cameron Diaz other than she is just plain awful here. There has to be more to acting than flashing your blue eyes and flipping your silky blonde hair. Her scenes with Jude Law are excruciating to watch for any self-respecting MAN ... and should be the same way for any woman.Kate Winslet was just phenomenal in this years' 'Little Children'. It showed she is as good as any actress working today. That makes her part in this even more painful; however, I will say her scenes with Eli Wallach are what keep the film from being a total flop. Winslet has this aura of goodness and she comes across very sincere. The great Eli Wallach has a sparkle in his eye and steals every scene he is in. What a pleasure to watch a true pro at his best.Having just seen Almodovar's 'Volver', it provided a terrific contrast between filmmakers who write about women. Almodovar has true insight into strong women and insecure women, while Meyers just writes about women as if they are characters in romance novels. Evidently that is the difference between art and box office power.",5,0,2,24 December 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," No Easy Decade
","Greetings again from the darkness. Kathryn Bigelow entered the realm of elite directors when her war thriller The Hurt Locker exploded onto the Oscar scene a few years ago. Once again she proves why the critics adore her, and the movie going masses stay away. She is an expert filmmaker, a brilliant technician, though not much into the whole entertainment scene.We always try to label films and this one doesn't quite fit as thriller or action, or even war, genre. It's really a tense, procedural drama focusing on the behind-the-scenes CIA hunt for Osama bin Laden. In fact, it's mostly the story of one obsessed CIA agent's research and un-wavering pursuit of the one most responsible for the tragic events of 9-11-01 (as well as many others).The film started out as a story of the nearly decade long pursuit and the failure to find him. Everything, including the movie, changed on May 2, 2011 when Navy SEAL Team Six pulled off the daring and historic mission to kill bin Laden. The book 'No Easy Day' by Mark Owen (pseudonym for real life SEAL Matt Bissonnette) was released and many of the details became public. Bigelow and her writer Mark Boal (former journalist) went even deeper into research mode and now the film has instigated Congressional hearings in regards to some of the scenes.Bigelow presents this as old school, hard core males vs the intellectual, instinctive and brazen Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. In the book, she is referred to as 'Jen', but her name matters not. What's important is her laser-like focus for almost 10 years, despite the numerous attempts by her superiors to ignore her theories.Much of the film deals with the group meetings and presentations to CIA mid-managers, who either don't trust her or refuse to put their own careers on the line. Maya remains relentless. She finally gets a audience with CIA Director Leon Panetta (played by James Gandolfini) and introduces herself as 'the M*****F****R who found this place, sir'. This comes across as confident, not disrespectful.Bigelow and Boal refuse the temptation of providing any real backstory or personal life on these characters. We do learn that Maya was recruited right out of high school, so we can assume she wasn't a typical 18 year old. The only thought of a romantic interlude is quickly shot down by Maya proclaiming (in so many words), she's not that kind of girl.Most of the men in the film are presented as near Neanderthals. Jason Clarke is the old school field agent who has mastered the use of torture, water-boarding and humiliation to gain information from detainees. The '60 Minutes' clip of Obama saying that America will no longer utilize torture is one of the few tips to national politics that the film offers up. The only politics are those played by station chief Kyle Chandler, who is protective of his job, and Mark Strong, who seems relatively helpless without the support of his superiors. All this while Maya keeps pushing and pounding for action.The Langley vs Field work provides a distinctive line in the sand between the two worlds, and emphasizes just how easy it is to make a mistake in judgment. What if we had been wrong on the location of bin Laden? What if the 'fortress' had belonged to a drug dealer instead and the SEAL team had invaded a private home within the boundaries of supposed ally Pakistan? Jessica Chastain is believable and tough in her role, and Jason Clarke dominates the screen in his early scenes. Other fine support work comes courtesy of Edgar Ramirez, Mark Duplass, Harold Perrineau, and Jennifer Ehle. When we finally get to the strategy session for the mission, we meet SEAL's played by Chris Pratt and Joel Edgerton. The 25 minutes or so dedicated to the helicopter mission are filmed as if we are wearing the same night-vision goggles worn by the brave souls storming the castle. It's a very impressive sequence.If you enjoy the details of a procedural drama, then you will find much to like here ... knowing the ultimate outcome doesn't affect the suspense one bit. However, if you seek an entertaining respite from your daily grind, this one will offer no assistance ... despite another excellent and minimalistic mood score from Alexadre Desplat.",7,95,185,5 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Conducting the Orchestra
","Greetings again from the darkness. Does it take the smartest guy in the room to write about the smartest guy in the room? Probably not, but as Aaron Sorkin shows in writing about Steve Jobs, it can't hurt. It's an impressive filmmaking team that, in addition to Sorkin, includes director Danny Boyle, and a cast of Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg, Katherine Waterston, Seth Rogen, John Ortiz and Perla Haney-Jardine  that's a lot of talent, prestige, and award-winners.The film is based on the terrific authorized biography written by Walter Isaacson. Rather than tackle the entirety of the book or Jobs' life, a theatrical approach is taken with three distinct acts covering 16 years centered on product roll-outs: Macintosh, 1984; NeXT, 1988; and iMac, 1998. You might notice that two of those products are considered major flops, but the focus is on the actions of Jobs, not the performance of the products. Director Boyle makes his presence felt by filming appropriately in each of the segments: 16mm for 1984, 35mm for 1988, and digital for 1998. He also brings a sweeping beauty to the visuals  whether it's Jobs storming through a hallway, or the maze of activity backstage at each roll-out.While it's humorous to witness the cult-like atmosphere that develops around Apple products, it's equally comical to see the small-minded types who refuse to credit Jobs or Apple for catapulting consumer technology ahead by decades, and achieving levels of financial success never before reached. Although it's difficult to separate Jobs from Apple, Sorkin and Boyle are very clear in their focus on the man. In fact, the movie could be viewed as a kind of dysfunctional family – both genetic family and work family.Rogen plays Steve Wozniak and Stuhlbarg plays Andy Hertzfeld, both part of the original Apple team with Jobs. There are some pointed exchanges between these three characters, with the most eye-raising being when Woz asks Jobs, 'What do you do?' It's the best display of what makes Jobs different than others, and his answer is one of the most disheartening compliments ever heard. There are multiple extended sequences with Jobs and his quasi-father figure John Sculley (Jeff Daniels). These two rip through Sorkin dialogue the way Michael Jordan once sliced through defenses. Most cruel are the exchanges between Jobs and Chrisann Brennan (Ms. Waterston) – the mother of his daughter Lisa (though he refused to acknowledge being her father).For those familiar with the role of Joanna Hoffman in Jobs' career, you will be duly impressed with the performance of Kate Winslet  playing the only one who could consistently stand up to the relentless pressure and lofty expectations.There are soft references to iPods and iPads, and Jobs' break-up with Apple is dramatized, but it's the individual scenes of interaction with others that makes this entertaining and challenging to watch. There is nothing likable about Steve Jobs the man, but Fassbender's performance does allow glimpses of humanity beneath the God-like aura Jobs presented. Was Jobs a genius? Was he an extreme social misfit? Was he a cruel family man due to his botched adoption as a kid? Regardless of where you place him in the realm of technology development, it's difficult to argue with Woz's proclamation that one can be 'decent AND gifted'. It's not binary.",7,0,1,5 November 2015
Crazy Heart," Not so Bad to the Bone
","Greetings again from the darkness. The broken down country singer finding redemption could be one of the biggest cliché's in life and the movies. Somehow first time writer/director Scott Cooper and the great Jeff Bridges make it seem authentic, raw and touching.Much of their success is in the amazingly subtle performance of Jeff Bridges. Heck, I believe I have the early stages of emphysema just from watching the film! Bridges' skill has always been that he melts into his role. You don't even believe he is acting - he is just that good. Here, he descends into the role of Bad Blake. Alcoholic, chain-smoking, nearly dead to the world.Supporting work from Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine, though a bit unbelievable and Robert DuVall (also listed as a producer) plays Blake's only real friend who offers him a bit of support when needed. This recalls DuVall's excellent turn many years ago in Tender Mercies.What sets this one apart is the realistic and raw performance of Bridges. The man is not afraid to put it on the screen. He does a good job with the singing and is certainly believable onstage. His protégé is played by Colin Farrell and their interacting is a bit awkward, as one would expect .. Farrell's character has gone on to superstardom, while trying not to forget his mentor.This one is being compared to The Wrestler, but I don't feel the need to do so. It stands on it's own and certainly Mr. Bridges should be a contender for the Oscar he has earned on more than one occasion. T Bone Burnett and the late Stephen Bruton wrote the music, including the excellent 'The Weary Kind', which should gather some Oscar love.",7,3,7,28 December 2009
War of the Worlds," No, not like Europe
","Greetings again from the darkness. Let's start with the positive. This film boasts the greatest special effects on film to date. It easily surpasses the latest Star Wars or Lord of the Rings films. Some of the effects will leave you breathless and wide-eyed. The best compliment I can offer is, everything looks real ... even the unreal. The relentless pace will leave you feeling exhausted until the ending ruins that feeling. With world destruction going on how does anyone have pressed clothes, make-up and brushed hair? I will also say that the entire Tim Robbins (flashing his 'Mystic River' accent) sequence was confusing and ridiculous except for the 'Jurassic Park' type shot (remember the kids hiding in the kitchen?) Tom Cruise proves he is best at being Tom Cruise. In other words, he is no Tom Hanks as an actor. On the other hand, Dakota Fanning ('Man on Fire' 'Cat and the Hat' and little Melanie in 'Sweet Home Alabama') shows off a much greater range than her overpaid, over-hyped and overexposed superstar screen dad. Film historian Steven Spielberg does a tip of the cap to the 1953 original by offering a quick shot of that film's stars, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson. Did anyone else notice that the sound emanating from the aliens sounded suspiciously like the opening chords to Black Sabbath's 'I am Iron Man'? Also, why is it that every Tom Cruise film has him running at least one wind sprint? Despite the negatives (and there are many), the film scores high due to the phenomenal technical film-making of Spielberg and ILM craftsmen. A must see for film buffs and sci-fi types.",6,7,14,1 July 2005
Mudbound," hatred is not new
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Jim Crow South and WWII have each spawned many movies, and both play a crucial role in director Dee Rees' (BESSIE) adaptation (co-written with Virgil Williams) of Hillary Jordan's 2008 novel. It's the story of two families, the Jacksons and the McAllans, striving for daily survival in rural Mississippi during the 1940's. The Jacksons are a black family tenant-farming on land owned by the white McAllans who transplanted from Memphis. This land is so remote and life so hard, that tractors are almost non-existent and mules are rare enough. There is such a bleakness to this existence that all seem oblivious to the always present mudhole leading to the front door of their shack. Elation comes in the form of a privacy wall constructed around the outdoor family shower, or the sweetness of a bar of chocolate. Soon after D-Day, Florence and Hap Jackson send their son Ronsel off to war. The same thing is happening across the 200 acre farm to Jamie McAllan, brother of Henry and son of Pappy. A shifting of multiple narrators throughout allows us access to the perspectives of multiple characters. We get both black and white views on war and farming. Days in war bring injury, death and dirt  not so dissimilar to life on a Mississippi farm. When Ronsel and Jamie return from war, they are both suffering. Ronsel can't come to grips with how he was treated as a redeemer in Europe, but just another 'black man' being targeted by the KKK at home, while Jamie is shell-shocked into alcoholism and an inability to function in society. The parallels between the war experience of Ronsel and Jamie lead them to a friendship that ultimately can't be good for either. Jason Clarke plays Henry and Carey Mulligan, his wife Laura. Jonathan Banks ('Breaking Bad', 'Better Call Saul') is the ultimate nasty racist Pappy, while Garrett Hedlund is Jamie. Rob Morgan and Mary J Blige are Hap and Florence Jackson, and Jason Mitchell (STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON) is Ronsel. While all perform well, it's Mitchell and Hedlund who are particular standouts, as is a radio reference of the great Lou Boudreau. Rachel Morrison's cinematography is terrific and captures both the hardscrabble life of Mississippi, but also the frantic and tragic abruptness of war (in just a couple of scenes). Racism is always difficult to watch, and in that era, everyone had their place/plight in life. It was a structure built to ensure misery for most, and one guaranteed to collapse. The acting here is very strong and the film is well made. The story-telling is consistently disquieting and periodically unbearable. Still, we are all tired (or should be) of hatred. The somewhat hopeful ending caused an audible sigh of relief from an audience of viewers who had been angry and clinched for more than two hours. And though there is no joy in Mudville, we remain hopeful, even today.",7,35,61,9 November 2017
12 Years a Slave," Live, not just Survive
","Greetings again from the darkness. Should this be labeled a historical drama? Is it one man's extraordinary tale of strength and survival? Does this fall into the 'art film' category that so divides the movie-going public? The answer to all is YES, and I would add that it's a masterfully crafted film with exquisite story telling, stunning photography and top notch acting throughout.The movie is based on the real life and writings of Solomon Northrup, a free man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery from 1841-53. Northrup's story provides us a look inside the despicable institution of slavery. Needless to say, it's a painful and sad process made even more emotional by the work of director Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame). McQueen takes a very direct approach. Not much is left to the imagination. Torture, abuse, cruelty and misery take up the full screen. The only subtlety comes from the terrific work of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northrup. His facial expressions and eyes are more powerful and telling than any lines of dialogue could be.You will not find many details from the movie here. This is one to experience for yourself. It lacks the typical Hollywood agenda when it comes to American history. Instead this era is presented through the eyes of a single wronged man and his quest to return to his wife and kids, no matter the inhumane obstacles. We see Paul Giamatti as an emotionless, all-business slave trader. Benedict Cumberbatch is a plantation owner who has a heart, but lacks business savvy. And finally we enter the world of cotton farmer Michael Fassbender, who twists Bible scripture into threats directed at the slaves - his 'property'.Fassbender dives deep into evil to find his character, and along with Ejiofor, Sarah Paulsen (who plays Fassbender's icy wife), and Lupita Nyong'o (who plays slave Patsey, the center of the two most incredible scenes in the film), provide more Oscar worthy performances than any one movie can expect. You will also note Quvenzhane Wallis (as Northrup's daughter) and Dwight Henry (as a slave) in their first appearances since Beasts of the Southern Wild. Other strong support comes from Scoot McNairy, Taran Killam (SNL), Michael K Williams, Alfre Woodward, a nasty Paul Dano, Garret Dillahunt and Adepero Oduye.Steven Spielberg gave us a taste of the holocaust with Schindler's List, but not since the TV mini-series 'Roots' has any project come so close to examining the realities of slavery. Northrup's story seems to be from a different universe than the charming slaves of Gone with the Wind. I would argue that what makes this watchable (though very difficult) is the focus on Northrup's story. While tragic, his ending actually deflects from the ongoing plight of those not so fortunate. It's a story of a man who states he doesn't wish to merely survive, he wants to live a life worth living.McQueen's direction will certainly be front and center come awards season, as will many of the actors, John Ridley (the screenwriter), Sean Bobbitt (cinematographer) and Hans Zimmer (score). The only question is whether the subject matter is too tough for Oscar voters, who traditionally lean towards projects a bit more mainstream.",8,19,32,27 October 2013
Wedding Crashers," Why don't you two not talk?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Often with comedies, the trailer gives away all the funny parts. What is really sad is when the trailer is BETTER than the movie. Let me start by saying I am a huge Vince Vaughn fan. The man is funny and talented. So when he swings and misses, I will usually give him the benefit of doubt. We have come to expect more misses than hits from his cohort, Owen Wilson. To put it nicely, this is a miss. To put it bluntly, this is god-awful.The premise is terrific! Couple of single guys BSing and charming their way to 'success' at weddings of people they don't know. Problem is these guys seem old and cartoonish. Just can't believe very many women would fall for their ridiculous set-ups. Watching the scenes with Owen and Vince had me convinced they just rolled the camera and edited miles of film. Many of the scenes are choppy and abrupt. The soundtrack has a couple of the worst songs I have ever heard anywhere outside an elevator.As far as the good stuff, Isla Fisher ('I Heart Huckabees') is outstanding in her quirky role and Rachel McAdams ('The Notebook' 'Mean Girls') appears primed for stardom. She has quite the screen presence. Christopher Walken goes through the motions as the head of the Kennedy-esquire clan and Jane Seymour is downright awful as the drunk, miserable maternity figure. Will Ferrell (had to be him or Ben Stiller) has the predictable cameo as Chaz, the Wedding Crasher guru who has moved on to an even more despicable pastime. There is a semi-interesting early scene with Dwight Yoakum and Rebecca DeMorney, but no matter how hard I try, there is very little worth watching here.",4,4,12,30 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Drink from your Milkshake
","Greetings again from the darkness. Even as a kid, I never understood why God needed so much money. Business I understood. Religion was presented as the spiritual necessity of the cleansed and righteous soul ... yet tithing of less than 10% was considered selfish. On the other hand, business was upfront about the mission of profit. To me, there was only the finest of lines between the two. PT Anderson makes my point in a far more stylish manner than I could ever hope.The extraordinary lord of acting, Daniel Day-Lewis is once again bigger than life on screen ... this time as Daniel Plainview, a self-proclaimed oilman and hater of people. Day-Lewis is so fascinating in that he is one of the few actors that just grab your eyes and hold on while he is on screen. Here, his subtle gestures and eye movements are more than enough to hold us at attention. He has the look and feel of an oilman at the turn of the century. We also know for certain that he is a tortured soul.Mr. Plainview's nemesis is not just the dirt he drills in, but also the young prophet, Eli Sunday, played to spooky perfection by Paul Dano (so wonderful as the son/brother in 'Little Miss Sunshine'). In their few scenes together, it is like watching two expert fighters with opposite style go at each other. Plainview's prop is his cute, young son (played well by Dillon Freasier) and Eli's prop is the cross around his neck. Just a guilty pleasure watching these two spar.Based on Upton Sinclair's novel 'Oil', director PT Anderson (the underrated 'Magnolia' and 'Punch Drunk Love' and the overrated 'Boogie Nights') provides a film that on the surface appears quiet, while ... like the oil ... just under the surface is simmering with emotion and action. The majestic performance of Day-Lewis brings it all together, but Anderson must receive credit for some stunning shots and tension filled scenes.The film has a very unusual look and feel so to compliment it, we are given a score from Jonny Greenwood (of Radiohead fame). The guitar is haunting and, at times startling. What prevents this one from pure greatness is the over-the-top final sequences between Plainview and Eli. If that scene had been handled differently, the last scene with Plainview and his son would have been even more powerful.",9,5,14,4 January 2008
Burlesque," The Other Team
","Greetings again from the darkness. Just back from a screening and must admit that I was blown away by Christina Aguilera. The film is first and foremost a showcase of her talent ... and quite a talent she is!Ali (Aguilera) is a bored, small town Iowa girl who heads off to find the bright lights of L.A. She stumbles into a Burlesque club and is immediately enchanted by the songs, the dancers and the overall feel of the place. The club is co-owned by Tess (Cher) and her ex-husband Vince (Peter Gallagher) and is headed towards financial disaster. Local real estate developer Marcus (Eric Dane) rides in on a white horse and fat wallet and offers to rescue Tess and Vince. Of course, his plans for the club are anything but altruistic.Meanwhile, Marcus and Jack the bartender (Cam Gigandet) battle over Ali, though neither are very good at it. While that battle is going on Ali manages to beat out Nikki (Kristin Bell) for the spotlight on stage. This is when the movie really takes off, musically speaking.From a musical perspective, Cher belts out a couple of solos that easily convince that her pipes are still full strength. Her two songs are definite highlights and it's a pleasure to see her still in top form. Aguilera has so many numbers that I lost track. Most are average songs at best, but her voice is so unique and powerful that the non-descript songs come off fine.Must also mention Alan Cumming and especially Stanley Tucci. Mr. Tucci is clearly the best actor in the movie, though he basically reprises his character from The Devil Wears Prada.There will be comparisons to Dreamgirls, Moulin Rouge!, Cabaret and Chicago. Writer and first time director Steve Antin pretty much stays out of the way of Cher and Aguilera, while delivering the expected product to his intended audience ... not that there's anything wrong with it.",6,1,5,17 November 2010
Joker," funny like a clown
","Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as 'The Hangover' franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, 'I have nothing but bad thoughts', we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any 'real' Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for 'Chernobyl') serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's 'Send in the Clowns', Jimmy Durante singing 'Smile', Cream's 'White Room', 'That's Life' by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar 'Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2'. The 'Smile' song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind.",7,28,61,3 October 2019
A Hard Day's Night," I'm a Mocker
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's the 50th anniversary and what a treat to see the re-mastered, restored film in a crowded theatre - many wearing their Beatles shirts. The quasi-documentary, cinema verite' approach from director Richard Lester may not fit the traditional idea of a great movie, but at a minimum, it's a fantastic pop culture artifact showing a world on the verge of change.This is The Beatles first film and this is the most innocent and fresh-faced we ever see them ... it's just a few months after their first appearance on 'the Ed Sullivan Show'. John is the most guarded, but his quick wit and distrust of the establishment are obvious. Paul is at his cutest and least arrogant, but still managing to pose on cue. George comes across most open and full of joy - before he became the most publicly withdrawn. Ringo is self-deprecating and in full hang-dog mode.For a stark contrast, watch the four lads a year later in HELP!, also directed by Mr. Lester. The luster of fame has clearly tarnished and they are quite aware of the power they wield. Still, during this shoot, we are almost 'on set' as the boys are first experiencing Beatlemania! In addition to the Fab Four, British actor Wilfrid Brambill plays Paul's Grandfather. The recurring gag of him being 'very clean' is a play on Brambill's long-running role as Albert Steptoe in 'Steptoe & Son' where he is referred to as 'a dirty old man'. Victor Spinetti plays the very anxious TV director wearing the infamous sweater. Mr. Spinetti also appeared in HELP! (1965) and The Magical Mystery Tour (1967). Richard Vernon played the grumpy old man sharing the train car with the boys. Mr. Vernon also appeared in Goldfinger that same year. Another James Bond link occurs when Ringo is invited to the Le Cercle Club ... the same club James Bond first appears in Dr. No (1962). Lastly, Pattie Boyd is one of the giggly schoolgirls on the train and appears in 3 different scenes. 18 months later, she was married to George Harrison ... and a few years later, she proved her attraction to lead guitarists by marrying Eric Clapton.I was caught off guard by the frenetic pace of the film ... it has been 3 decades since I last watched it. But mostly, I was stunned at the clean look of this restored version and was awed by the terrific sound, especially of the song restorations completed by Giles Martin, the son of Beatles record producer George Martin ... who was nominated for an Academy Award for his film score.The film inspired the 1960's TV show 'The Monkees', and of course, the soundtrack was a massive seller. 'If I Fell' is one of my favorite Beatles songs and it's a nice segment in the film, but the real climax is the performance of 'She Loves You', replete with terrific crowd shots. The impact and lasting impression of the film is every bit as recognizable as that stunning opening chord to the title track that opens the film.",9,0,0,16 July 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Doug Liman is best known for his fine work at the beginning of the 'Bourne' franchise. His latest has so many obstacles to overcome, a tip of the cap is in order for a thriller that isn't altogether without merit.These obstacles include such things the all too familiar sub-genre of alien-invasion, an overload of special effects, a familiar actress in an unfamiliar action-hero role, and above all others, the casting of the divisive Tom Cruise ... whose detractors will certainly get a kick out of the nearly endless stream of on screen deaths his character experiences. After all, what's more fun than bashing Cruise over and over and over again? On the plus side, the special effects are very well done; Emily Blunt (despite being the best tanned Brit ever) more than holds her own; and the role allows Tom Cruise to do the two things he does best: incredible stunts and action sequences, and transform from cocky d-bag to dependable, highly competent icon. Without much thought, it's pretty easy to see the similarities to his characters in Top Gun, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, and The Color of Money ... and of course, his recent outing in Oblivion. There is also a convenient excuse for Cruise to lose his battle helmet, an unnecessary segment of him riding his motorcycle, and of course, the patented Cruise sprint is on display.The movie itself begs for the obvious comparison to Groundhog Day and Source Code, with elements of Aliens, District 9, and The Matrix. Despite all the familiarity, this one kind of works thanks to the screenplay of Christopher McQuarrie (3 other Cruise movies) based on the 2004 novel from Hiroshi Sakurazaka entitled 'All You Need is Kill'. Why the Producers chose this generic, daytime soap opera type title over the source material title is beyond me.Cruise especially takes to the first half comedic moments, and that explains why the first half of the movie is much stronger than the second half. The phrase 'On your feet, Maggot' takes on the the Sonny and Cher role from Groundhog Day, and to great effect. Supporting work from Noah Taylor, Brendan Gleeson, and (a scene chewing) Bill Paxton add sufficient distraction from the heavy action moments.So whether you enjoy special effects, intense action scenes, or just watching Tom Cruise get killed time and time again, you will probably find this one entertaining enough ... even though not much will stick with you a day later.",6,7,13,8 June 2014
Downfall," Eavesdropping on History
","Greetings again from the darkness. Any filmmaker takes a risk putting the image of Adolf Hitler on screen. Many argue that providing any type of human image for this monster is too good for him. On the other hand, many believe there is much to learn from this tragic, horrific era. 'Downfall' is based on two separate books by Joachim Fest and Traudl Junge. The movie begins and ends with portions of Frau Junge's final interview. It is painful to watch her in her 80's still struggling with choices made in her 20's. Her conscience still eating away as she asks the question of herself, 'Could I have known?'.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has crafted a docu-drama that leaves us feeling as if we are in the bunker during those final 12 days. The emotions of all involved are gut-wrenching. It is stunning to witness Hitler's balancing act of continuing his pursuit of world dominance in front of his officers, while carefully orchestrating his own demise behind closed doors.While most of the acting is top notch, there are 4 performances that truly stand out. Alexandria Maria Lara as Traudl Junge was a joy to watch as she dutifully and loyally carries out her job tasks, while maintaining an immense respect and admiration for her boss. Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun literally brightens the screen and bunker every time she appears. Apparently comfortable with her place in history - beside her man in a hopeless situation, her smile never leaves as she exudes confidence for those closest to Hitler. Corinna Hartouch as Magda Goebbels ALMOST had me believing that lovingly poisoning one's kids could be forgivable when losing a way of life that has absorbed into their soul.Of course, what really makes this film work is the chillingly masterful performance of Bruno Ganz. It is as if we are watching home movies from the bunker. His power while strategizing with the officers and charm when dealing with kids and women are frightening. The most amazing times, however, come during his moments of soul-searching as he realizes the dream is lost.Accept this as an insight into history and not an attempt to humanize the monster. There are no signs that the filmmaker has attempted to excuse any of the decisions made by the regime. This is strictly a historical perspective on the confusion and paranoia brought on when power thirsty types lose their way. Amazing to watch.",9,2,4,13 March 2005
Whiplash," Just My Tempo
","Greetings again from the darkness. The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty. No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine. You will likely have a mentor, teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits. This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society's current preferred method of nurturing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory. Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich. When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble, Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered. The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons' portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket. This is no Mr Holland's Opus. Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights.Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in 'Oz'. Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians.You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's 'Caravan'. See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle 'good job'.",8,186,263,26 October 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," More More More
","Greetings again from the darkness. A brilliant and expertly made film that is excruciatingly painful to watch, yet impossible to look away. That would be my one line review. Of course, that line could be followed by a 10 page essay, to which I won't subject you. How to do justice to this extraordinary three hours of excess and debauchery? How to give due credit the craftsmanship of director Martin Scorcese? How to acknowledge the pure physicality and kinetic energy of Leonardo DiCaprio's performance? How to heap praise on a project so lacking in morality and decency? There are no easy answers to these four questions, but there is plenty to discuss.Let's be clear. This is a vulgar film telling the disgusting story of a crude and egotistical scam artist who defrauded many innocent people. Jordan Belfort's autobiography serves as the source material for the screenplay from Terrence Winter (The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire). Leonardo DiCaprio (in his fifth collaboration with Martin Scorcese) portrays Belfort as the talented stock broker who soaks up lessons from both his mentor and the real world stock market crash of 1987. That Black Monday led him right into the world of penny stocks and huge commissions. Those commissions and his stunning sales skills take right into a world that rivals that of Caligula or Fellini's Satyricon.Sex. Drugs. Rock and Roll. Sorry, that's not enough for Belfort. He is also driven by money, greed, power and the need to take advantage of the weak. I lost count, but surely Belfort displays more than seven deadly sins. Everything is extreme. Nothing in moderation. Belfort is both smart and stupid. He is the worst of human nature, and when combined with his charisma, becomes very dangerous. Watching him give his invigorating and over-the-top pep talks to the team recalls the cult evangelists we have seen over the years. His religion is money and winning ... never accepting 'no'. His followers eat it up.While most of the movie is pedal to the metal, there are two exceptional scenes that really stood out. When a young, eager, new to Wall Street Belfort has lunch with his mentor (played by Matthew McConaughey), we sense him soaking up the lessons ... we see the wheels turning to a new way of thinking. McConaughey is in top form here. The other standout scene takes place aboard Belfort's yacht as he interacts with the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler. This agent is the closest thing to a moral barometer the movie allows and this dance of dialogue and acting is pure cinematic magic.Jonah Hill as Belfort's business partner is his physical opposite, and possibly even less morally-centered than Belfort. He is also extremely funny in a demented way. Three very talented film directors have supporting roles. Rob Reiner (in a rare acting gig) plays Belfort's bombastic dad and firm accountant. Jon Favreau is the high priced attorney fighting off the SEC and FBI. Spike Jonze plays the boiler room manager who first schools Belfort on penny stocks, and sets the wheels in motion. There is also a very sexy, funny performance from Margot Robbie as Belfort's second wife.My words don't do justice to the manic existence and frenzied scenes of sex, profanity and drug use. The black comedy mixed in prevents this from being the bleak portrayal that it could have been, but don't underestimate the depths to which the characters will stoop to get what they want. This one makes a similarly themed American Hustle look like a Disney flick. Consider yourself warned ... and don't think you can just look away.",7,2,9,27 December 2013
The Last King of Scotland," You're My Closest Adviser
","Greetings again from the darkness. A true tour de force by Forest Whitaker ... the best performance of the year so far! Somehow Mr. Whitaker captures the madness and charm of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Amin was one of the first political rock stars. He used the media to his advantage as his regime slaughtered hundreds of thousands of his countrymen.Also impressive is James McAvoy ('Chronicles of Narnia') who plays the dramatized Nicholas Garrigan, a young doctor who sets out on an adventure to make a difference in a small country and ends up counseling one of the most powerful madmen in history. Scottish documentarian Kevin Macdonald directs the film with only a few lapses in directness, which serve this biopic very well. Watching Amin and the young doctor immerse themselves in the shower of power is both frightening and sickening. Macdonald captures this spirit very well thanks mostly to his willingness to let his two leads do their thing.As Amin laughs and tells Garrigan that 'You are my closest adviser', I couldn't help but compare to Kathy Bates telling James Caan (in 'Misery') that 'I'm your number one fan'. The evil and insanity is simply chilling. Whitaker is just amazing as he flips the switch from media darling to cold blooded, ruthless murderer ... and then back again. Just a terrific performance and well worth the price of admission - maybe a couple of times! Good for a laugh is the most unique version of Janis Joplin's 'Me and Bobby McGee' that you have ever heard ... guaranteed! See this one for a bit of history and the site of a real monster, but also for one of the best film performances ever.",8,200,235,1 November 2006
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail Hollywood
","Greetings again from the darkness. Homage or Spoof or outright Farce? Though the Coen Brothers motivation may be cloudy, their inspiration certainly is not. The Golden Age of Hollywood is skewered by the filmmaking brothers who previously applied their caustic commentary to the movie business in Barton Fink (1991). However, this latest seems to borrow more from the unrelated universes of their films A Serious Man (2009) and Burn After Reading (2008) in that it alternates tone by focusing first on one man's attempt to make sense of things, and then with a near slapstick approach to 'urgent' situations.The film seems to be made for Hollywood geeks. Perhaps this can also be worded as  the film seems to be made for the Coen brothers themselves. Rather than an intricate plot and subtle character development used in their classic No Country for Old Men (2007), this is more a collection of scenes loosely tied together thanks to their connection to Eddie Mannix, Capitol Pictures 'fixer'. Josh Brolin plays Mannix, a twist on the real Eddie Mannix, notorious for his behind the scenes work at MGM in controlling the media, protecting the stars and studio, and protecting movie stars from their own idiotic actions. He was a real life Ray Donovan. It's Mannix's job that creates the hamster wheel to keep this story moving (with a complement from narrator Michael Gambon).We witness a typical day for Mannix as he confesses to the Priest that he had a couple of cigarettes after promising his wife he would quit, negotiates with communists who have kidnapped the studios biggest movie star, deftly handles the studio head's greedy desire to shift a western movie star into a genre for which he is ill-prepared, plans a cover-up for the starlet having a baby out of wedlock, and juggles the demands of the competing twin gossip columnists searching for scandal. Mannix keeps his cool through all of this while mulling a lucrative job offer from Lockheed that would put him right in the midst of the nuclear war scare.With an exacting attention to period and industry detail, the Coen's remind us of the popular genres and circumstances of the era. George Clooney plays mega star Baird Whitlock, working on the studios biggest picture of the year – a biblical epic entitled 'Hail, Caesar!' (think Ben-Hur, The Robe, etc). Whitlock is kidnapped by a group of communist writers (not yet blacklisted) who are striking out against a capitalistic studio that doesn't share the rewards with the creative folks. It's a different look than what Trumbo offered last year. In a tribute to Roy Rogers and famed stuntman Yakima Canutt, there is a segment on popular westerns featuring Alden Ehrenreich (Beautiful Creatures, 2013) as Hobie Doyle, a popular actor whose an artist with a rope and horse and guitar, but not so smooth on his transition to the parlor dramas being filmed by demanding director Laurence Laurentz (a terrific Ralph Fiennes). In boosting Doyle's public perception, the studio sets him up on a date with a Carmen Miranda-type played by Veronica Osorio. Her character is named Carlotta Valdez in a nod to Hitchcock's Vertigo. Another sequence features Scarlett Johansson as DeAnna Moran, an Esther Williams type (with a behind the scenes nod to Loretta Young) in a Busby Berkeley-esque production number featuring the synchronized swimming so prominent in the era. One of the film's best segments comes courtesy of Channing Tatum in a take on films like On the Town, where sailors would sing and dance while on leave.Tilda Swinton (whose appearance improves any movie) appears as the competing twin sister gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thackery. Her hats and costumes are sublime and pay worthy tribute to Hedda Hopper (who also balked at being termed a gossip columnist). Jonah Hill's only scene is from the trailer, and it could be misleading to any of his fan's coming to see his performance; and the same could be said for Frances McDormand (a very funny scene as a throwback editor). And so as not to disappoint their many critics, the Coen's have a terrific scene featuring four men of various religious sects who are asked their opinion of the script – so as not to offend any viewers. The pettiness is palpable.Roger Deakins is, as always, in fine form as the cinematographer. The water and western productions are the most eye-catching, but he does some of his best camera work in the shots of individual actors or scenes-within-a-scene. We have come to depend on Joel and Ethan Coen for taking us out of our movie comfort zone, while providing the highest level of production – music, costumes, sets, camera and acting. While this latest will leave many scratching their heads, the few in the target audience will be applauding fiercely.",7,5,18,6 February 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Afternoon Delight ... Sorta
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Fellow SNL writers and alum (Director) Adam McKay and Will Ferrell deliver a decent comedy with solid writing and mediocre direction.  It misses being a great comedy because it fails to provide any 'Classic moments or lines' that we associate with the great ones.  We can all quote lines from 'Blazing Saddles', 'Office Space' and 'Caddyshack', but my guess is 'Anchorman' will fade to black.  I say this despite the pure genius of Will Ferrell, who is the funniest guy working today in film.  He prevents the film from sliding into nothingness.  His physical presence and facial gestures are enough to keep the audience smiling ... but rarely howling.  Christina Applegate ('Married With Children') is miscast and mostly awful in her poorly written role.  Jury is out on whether she will make a successful transition to film.  Overall, I was definitely hoping for better.",6,1,3,18 July 2004
American Gangster," My Man
","Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we experience the convergence of a creative team who each bring their 'A' game. Director Ridley Scott has had ups and downs but certainly was focused on this project. Writer Steve Zaillan has delivered a couple of screenplays along the way that were probably nothing more than paychecks. We all know Denzel Washington has been known to work for the money and not the art. This group partners here with acting stud Russell Crowe to remind us of how cool movies can be.One of the more fascinating things about the film is how the two powerful leads don't share a scene until 80% of the film is over. Based on a true story, Denzel plays Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas as a street wise, true to the gangster code, businessman on a mission. It is my favorite Denzel role ever. He moves just like an animal on the prowl, eyes always moving ... until he sends the cold stare at someone before uttering 'My Man' ... which is usually one of the last things they hear.Crowe is just tremendous as the squeaky clean cop, who sucks as a father and husband, but is true to the code of justice and law. A pariah for turning in a trunk load of untraceable cash, Crowe is moved to a special drug investigative unit and he takes the assignment very seriously indeed! Watching him peel back the layers of the investigation and having it turn on a $50,000 fur coat and microwave oven, really is compelling. Once again, Crowe is at his peak. OK, the guy had a momentary lapse in 'A Good Year' (directed by Ridley Scott) but his resume is tough to match by most any actor.The supporting cast is stellar and affecting. For some reason, he is not listed in the credits, but Clarence Williams III is Bumpy, Lucas' boss and mentor. Williams is perfect for the tough, yet pensive leader. Josh Brolin ('Grindhouse') is chilling as the corrupt NY detective. I wanted to shoot him myself. Long lost Armand Assante is captivating as a drug lord who just can't compete with Lucas, so he partners up. Cuba Gooding, jr. escapes from crappy kid movies long enough to play a frightening gangster who loves the spotlight and doesn't enjoy being dissed. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ruby Dee and Joe Morton all have nice turns as well.The final showdown with Denzel and Crowe reminds a bit of 'Heat' when Pacino and Deniro FINALLY share a scene. With a touch of 'Serpico' and 'Blow', this one adds the touch of dueling codes ... street vs. cop. Just a fascinating (mostly) true story with amazing performances! I really love good movies!",8,1,7,2 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Already Dead, Just not Typed
","Greetings again from the darkness. The endless run of previews for this one had me a bit concerned that it might be a comedy with 4 funny scenes - all of which appear in the trailer. I never should have doubted director Marc Foster, who has two excellent films to his credit: 'Monster's Ball' and 'Finding Neverland'. As different as those two films are, 'Stranger Than Fiction' proves Mr. Foster has a real eye for quality scripts, regardless of genre.For anyone expecting a typical Will Ferrell film or performance, I say go in with an open mind instead. Ferrell is remarkably deadpan as IRS agent Harold Crick, who just so happens to also be the protagonist of novelist Kay Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) latest book. This is Ferrell's best performance on film to date.The film is a bit quirky, but provides an excellent look inside the world of creative writing, while at the same time allowing us to question the daily process we go through in living our lives. 'Adaptation' provided a look behind the curtain at the writing process and in this film the 'meet your maker' theme is an added bonus as a nice thought provoker. What if the maker is really making it up as he/she goes? What if we have more control over our destiny that some would believe? The three lead actors are all terrific. Ferrell as Harold Crick is like a blossoming flower as he discovers life with the luminescent Maggie Gyllenhaal (a baker - one who makes things for others enjoyment). Thompson is just outstanding as the blocked writer who always kills off her main characters and finally starts to question why. Few actresses would allow themselves to be filmed as disheveled and unmade-up as she appears here. Supporting work is solid by Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah (surely much of her role was left on the editing floor?), Tony Hale, Linda Hunt and an almost unrecognizable Tom Hulce (remember 'Amadeus'!).A solid script, nice direction, wonderful acting and a very interesting theme make this an excellent film for most ages. Pay attention to the nice music provided by Austin's own Spoon.",8,1,5,11 November 2006
The Reader," Hey Kid, Forget about her
","Greetings again from the darkness. Just not much for me to latch on to in this one. Found it often slow moving, nearly boring. The big climax appears to be should the Kid jump up in court to save her or let her maintain her 'dignity' by going to jail for life.The only two things that prevented this from being a total waste of time was the performance of Kate Winslet and some well photographed scenery. I certainly wouldn't rank this as one of the better films of 2008.It is always a pleasure to see the great Bruno Ganz work. Here he plays the kid's law professor who provides some life advice, which the kid basically ignores. Mr. Ganz was truly spectacular as Hitler in 'Downfall'.Not much else to say as the courtroom drama held little suspense and the love scenes seemed to go over the top in a meager attempt to give some depth to the film. Ralph Fiennes sleepwalks through his role as the grown up kid. There is no shortage of love stories or Holocaust films and I suggest selecting another.",5,2,4,14 February 2009
The Wrestler," Round and Round
","Greetings again from the darkness. Darren Aronofsky is quickly joining the elite as the breadth and depth of his films continue to amaze (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain). Here, he takes Robert Siegel's script and turns it on its ear. The best decision he made? Standing firm on his choice of Mickey Rourke, rather than Nic Cage. Rourke brings soul to this film that Cage has never even read about.Of course, the parallels between the story and Rourke's real life are well documented and somehow that is no distraction at all ... in fact, it adds to the realism and affect. Rourke's performance cannot be overstated. He is The Ram! Sure, he did a great job with the wrestling scenes, but that's just the tip. Watching him get out of bed, his hulking walk, the labored breathing and the lighting up in the ring ... those are the moments that heighten the performance and, in the end, make this movie so strong.Randy (not Robin!) the Ram is a sweet, gentle, lonely man just trying to figure out how to make a life after all these years. His life begs the question if it is better to have glory days to look back on or to have no glory days at all. It is painful watching him desperately trying to connect with someone ... either his angry, estranged daughter (played well by Evan Rachel Wood) or the tired, re-focused, middle-aged stripper played by Maris Tomei. He doesn't know what he wants, he just wants something.Aronofsky is to be commended for his take on the industry of wrestling. He is quite respectful for these entertainers who work hard, and literally bleed, for their craft. More importantly, he captures the community of wrestlers. These guys care for each other and a bond exists that only they understand. While at an autograph show, Rourke's character catches a glimpse of his future and it's not pretty.Some of my favorite scenes were: Randy and his daughter re-visiting the desolate boardwalk of yesteryear (analogy for Randy); drinking a beer and re-living the 80's with Tomei; and the fascinating backroom walk to his entry into the deli ... treated just like his walk to the ring at a wrestling event! Aronofsky treats much of this in quasi-documentary style, but Rourke's life is shown, warts and all. We feel his pain after a match and after heart surgery ... and as he is shut down by Wood and Tomei. This is not much of a motivational film, but it is fascinating and not to be missed by those who can appreciate an amazing performance. For fun, go home and put in your DVD of Body Heat or Diner ... compare the Mickey Rourke of 25 years ago to the Randy the Ram of that era. Also, gotta love the cool Springsteen song that ends the film.",8,0,1,11 January 2009
Dark Shadows," Season of the Witch
","Greetings again from the darkness. If anyone ever asks 'What was the name of that late 60's goth, supernatural soap opera with the cult following?', it's safe to assume they mean the TV series 'Dark Shadows'. It ran from 1966-1971 for a remarkable 1225 episodes. For those who remember it, the image they recall tends to be actor Jonathan Frid as Barnabus Collins ... the first vampire any of us ever saw outside of a Friday night horror film. The series made quite an impact on two young boys in particular: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.There are many reasons that movies get made. Pet projects or labors of love are not as common these days because of high production costs. But that's exactly what this movie is - a pet project for Burton and Depp. They clearly have fun with the characters, and the film dallies ever closely to the parody line. The initial set-up is brilliant and dark and ominous, leading us to believe this film will be in line with Burton's Sleepy Hollow or Corpse Bride. Instead, the rest of the movie is more in line with Beetlejuice. Definitely not a bad thing - just different than what we were prepped for.Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance as Barnabus Collins, the rich young man cursed by Angelique, the witch he spurns in love. His curse is to be turned into a vampire and buried alive. When his casket is discovered 196 years later, the world of 1972 is quite different than the one he left. He comically struggles to fit in and make sense of it all ... not the least of which is his remaining family. At his beloved Collinswood Manor lives Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller), Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), David Collins (Gulliver McGrath), the live-in child psychiatrist Dr Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), and their recently hired nanny Victoria (Bella Heathcote). While he was buried, the wicked witch Angelique (Eva Green) becomes the most powerful figure in town.Burton does a nice job poking fun at the 1970's with comedy that won't mean much to today's youngsters, but will hit home with those from the era. The art direction and sets are terrific, especially Collinwood Manor. The music of the 70's is used to comic effect, including a live performance by Alice Cooper. Michelle Pfeiffer does the best job at capturing the look and feel of the original series, but her daughter's character (Moretz) takes an unnecessary turn as Burton tries to cram as much in as possible. In fact, the film is actually quite fun to watch, but is lacking real substance in the story department ... not dissimilar to the original series.This is the 8th film collaboration between Burton and Depp. They make a wonderful team, and Depp has added another entertaining character to his Captain Jack Sparrow, Edward Scissorhands, Mad Hatter legacy. His movements and speech pattern are especially entertaining as we are mesmerized by his milky white complexion. His dialogue (written by Seth Grahame-Smith) demands attention and is both comical and majestic simultaneously. Burton's tribute to the TV series includes cameos by four of the original actors: Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby as guests at the ball. It's a classy touch. Danny Elfman's score is a bit overwhelmed by the use of numerous 70's classics, and it was disappointing to hear The Killers version of 'Go All the Way' rather than The Raspberries as the closing credits rolled.Burton is one of the more visual directors and even though the story is a bit lacking, each scene gives us plenty to absorb. The ghosts are especially well done, as is the fishing town of Collinsport which was built just for the movie. It has many similarities to Bodega Bay, which film lovers will recognize as the setting for Hitchcock's The Birds. Lastly, Burton gives us another scene with the great Christopher Lee - this time as a boat captain caught between Angelique and Barnabus. Good stuff.",6,1,2,20 May 2012
Hancock," Call Me That One More Time
","Greetings again from the darkness. No question that Will Smith is a movie star and can pull off a super hero ... even an apathetic, alcoholic, amnesiac-stricken super hero. Here he is very physical while at the same time using facial expressions to try and get in touch with his more human side.This mess goes wrong pretty quickly. The special effects are overboard and director Peter Berg ('Very Bad Things', 'The Kingdom') way over directs ... especially with the 360 degree facial close-ups. All the eye gazing between Will Smith and Charlize Theron take away any mystery in what the big plot twist might be. Even the score is weak. Is it too much to ask for a decent theme song for a super hero? This one sounds like it is straight out of a John Ford movie, or maybe 'Wagon Train'.Jason Bateman has almost as much time as Will Smith but really isn't able to bring much to a nothing role. Smith is the only one who shows any depth as his is the only character with more than one dimension. The cartoonish special effects just don't work and the great little idea of the rehabbing super hero just falls flat. This one has the feel of MULTIPLE edits and cuts with the result of one that just isn't much fun. Go see 'Indy' or 'Iron Man' again as you wait for 'The Dark Knight'.",4,15,33,2 July 2008
12 Strong," giddyup
","Greetings again from the darkness. During the movie, Afghanistan is referred to as 'the graveyard of many empires'. Traditionally, January is the graveyard of most new movie releases, so it's a pleasant surprise when we see an entertaining, well-made and historically interesting film, and it's still mid-January! Doug Stanton's book 'Horse Soldiers' is the source material for director Nicolai Fuglsig's first feature film, and it's anything but a disappointment.The film opens on September 11, 2001 and subjects us, yet again, to those horrific images seared into the minds of anyone alive on that day. What most of us didn't know, was that about a month later, a team of U.S. Army Special Forces (the Green Berets) were being dropped into the rough and mostly unfriendly terrain of Afghanistan. This ridiculously courageous team of 12 men had one mission: secure Mazar-i-Sharif to prevent a takeover by the Taliban. An early scene tells us this won't be the usual blind patriotism we often see on screen. One of the soldiers, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon), is told (with a bit of anger) by his wife, 'I'll love you when you get back.' This contrasts to the usual loyal and stiff-upper-lip military wife we see in most war movies. Another wife scrubs the oven rather than snuggle with her man, while yet another coerces a taboo pledge to come home to her.Chris Hemsworth (THOR) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, the intelligent but not-yet-battle-tested leader of a special ops team. The plan is for Nelson and his team to connect with General Dostum, an Afghan War Lord in charge of the Northern Alliance, and fight together to gain control of Mazar. After arriving at a local outpost nicknamed 'The Alamo' (34 miles from town), the team gets their first surprise ... they must split up and cover the ground on horseback. Filmed in New Mexico, the journey is miserable and filled with danger - an ambush could occur at any moment, or perhaps they are being set-up by those they have been ordered to trust.Horseback riding, caves, the weather, and the elements of the terrain are all challenges, but none of it compares to facing the Taliban forces which number in the thousands, and feature tanks, rocket launchers and an endless supply of weaponry. Director Fuglsig utilizes a 'Days in Country' counter so that we can get some semblance of time and ongoing misery being fought through by the Americans. But no day is normal when the soldiers are on horseback while being attacked by tanks. The odds seem insurmountable.One of the more fascinating aspects of the story and welcome approaches of the film is back-and-forth between Captain Nelson and General Dostum. Initially, Dostum shows little respect by telling the young officer that he lacks 'the eyes of a killer' and isn't yet a warrior, and he spends a great deal of time lecturing and philosophizing on Nelson's behalf. Of course, the lessons may be frustrating in the moment, but aren't lost on Nelson as there is a huge payoff at the peak of the key battle.The battle scenes come in all sizes - small skirmishes and massive, large scale assaults. Each is intense and dramatic and well-staged, though there are some moments where we shake our head in disbelief. At least we do until we remember that this is a true story, and despite that, it is truly unbelievable.
The supporting cast includes Michael Pena and his snappy punchlines, Trevante Rhodes (MOONLIGHT), William Fichtner with a shaved head, Elsa Pataky - Hemsworth's real life wife as his screen wife, Taylor Sheridan, Geoff Stults and Jack Kesy. Rob Riggle plays Colonel Max Bowers, who was Riggle's commanding officer when he served in the Marines. The previously mentioned Michael Shannon is a bit underutilized, but the film's best moments are those with Hemsworth and Navid Negahban (as General Dostum). You likely recognize Negahban as Abu Nazir from 'Homeland'. It's their exchanges that show how the line between allies and enemies is not always crystal clear - even if they are fighting for the same thing.Writers Peter Craig (THE TOWN) and Ted Tally (Oscar winner for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) do a nice job of character development, and the camaraderie of the 12 men of ODA 595 seems authentic - despite some schmaltzy moments over their 23 days of Task Force Dagger. Early on, we are informed that the most important thing to take to war is 'a reason why', and then towards the end, Dostum explains that the United States is in a no-win situation: we are cowards if we go, and enemies if we stay. It's chilling commentary on a war that has dragged on much too long ... despite the heroic efforts of the 12 horse soldiers.",6,69,133,19 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," creature feature
","Greetings again from the darkness. I enjoy creature movies. Even as a kid I enjoyed creature movies (as distinguished from monster movies, which I'm also fond of). From the classics to the (very) low budget ones on late night TV to the fear-mongering from Japan  I enjoy them all. Of course the most fascinating of the bunch is King Kong, and this version arrives 84 years after the still magnificent 1933 version from Merian C Cooper and featuring Fay Wray.This time there is no shootout on The Empire State Building, and the connection between Kong and the girl is limited to a few knowing glances. Most of the film takes place on Kong's island  one he shares with some other creatures (not rodents) of unusual size. Unlike Spielberg in Jaws, who teased us for half the movie before finally revealing the shark, we get a glimpse of the imposing Kong very early on.The cast is the best yet for a creature feature. John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists/conspiracy theorists; Tom Hiddleston plays the world's only mercenary with perfect hair and skin; Brie Larson is a self-described anti-war photographer; while Samuel L Jackson, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann and Toby Kebbell play military men on their last mission at the end of the Vietnam War. The most colorful character is played by John C Riley – an eccentric WWII survivor who has been living on the island since 1944.Jordan Vogt-Roberts directs this version, and his resume of The Kings of Summer and mostly TV work begs the question of how the heck did he get this gig? Fortunately he has cinematographer Larry Fong alongside, and his significant big action picture experience is obvious in the breath-taking helicopter scene (as well as many others). It's impossible not to notice the extreme love shown to Apocalypse Now and even Jurassic Park. Some of the shots and tone seem as if pulled directly from those films  even moreso than the original King Kong. We even get Samuel L Jackson recycling his 'hold onto your butts' line.There is plenty here to satisfy us lovers of creature features, though this version certainly lacks the emotional impact of Fay Wray and Naomi Watts connecting with Kong ... not much Beauty, but plenty of Beast. It's certainly recommended that you stay for the post-credits scene that sets the stage for 2020.",7,1,4,25 March 2017
Ray," A RAY of Sunshine by Foxx
","Greetings again from the darkness. Spent a little time absorbing this one before hitting the keyboard. Having seen the great Ray Charles perform live many times, I was slightly apprehensive about how his early years would be treated on film. When I heard Taylor Hackford ('Against All Odds' 'An Officer and a Gentleman') would direct, I became less than thrilled. Although the film does not capture the true meaness of the times (racial inequities, music biz sleaze), it does a wonderful job of bringing to life the spirit of Mr. Charles' music genius. Terrifically acted throughout by Regina King (Will Smith's wife in 'Enemy of the State'), Bokeem Woodbine ('The Rock'), Curtis Armstrong (Booger in 'Revenge of the Nerds') as the visionary, Ahmet Ertegen and newcomer Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson - Ray's tough, hard working mother, this film is carried with dazzling brilliance by Jamie Foxx. Similar channeling was seen by Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman, Foxx IS Ray Charles. The head movement, smile and walk are all spot on. Foxx and the live Charles cuts make the movie work. A few Hackford things that I could have done without were the numerous close-ups and the whole drug rehab section. I would have liked more attention given to Charles' business saavy and his impact on musicians dealings with record companies. Casting was excellent ... down to the boyhood Ray and his brother. Numerous flashbacks are utilized to connect his childhood to growth as an adult. The drug abuse is dealt with head-on, as is his infidelity. The music will give you chills and please stay for the closing credits and the absolute best version of 'Georgia on my Mind' that you will ever hear. Everyone should own at least a couple of Ray Charles CD's and absorb the greatness of the performer.",8,1,2,11 November 2004
Shooter," The Challenges of Democracy
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Antoine Fuqua is best known for 'Training Day'. He obviously has a love and an eye for machismo moments and settings. Here Mark Wahlberg dodges bullets, bombs, helicopters and politicians ... while also providing himself with emergency medical service, going on a mission to take out the bad guys and even getting the girl. Busy day at the office.Yes, we have seen all of this many times before, and often done better in 'Bourne Identity', 'The Fugitive', 'Mission Impossible' and even 'MaGuyver'. Still there is always something fun about a good guy is wrongly accused and goes on a 'him against the world' quest to clear his name and right a wrong.This one has enough explosions to make Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott jealous, but Wahlberg brings just enough soul to his role to maintain our interest. Good support work from the underrated Michael Pena, a lispy Danny Glover, two beauties - Rhona Mitra and Kate Mara, Elias Koteas and a sleazy Senator played by Ned Beatty. There is also a nifty little appearance from the great Levon Helm, who just doesn't grace us with his presence nearly often enough.Even though some of the photography is beautiful, if you are looking for thought-provoking film-making, this one isn't for you. If you are looking for adrenaline rushes and testosterone-pumping action, give it a shot.",6,1,4,25 March 2007
Inception," Mazed and Confused
","Greetings again from the darkness. Some movies are made as pure visual entertainment. Others are made as a vision of a story. The best combine elements of both. The great ones WOW you with what you see on screen, while keeping your mind focused on the multiple dimensions of a story that just won't let you get ahead. The previous sentence is my feeble attempt at describing what happens during 'Inception'.Writer/director Christopher Nolan turns 40 at the end of this month. He now has 3 instant-classic films to his credit: 'Memento', 'The Dark Knight' and now 'Inception'. I am not a good enough writer to describe just how talented he his at making films. What I can tell you is that this movie gave me a 'runner's high' ... it put me 'in the zone'. As a viewer, I felt in perfect sync at each twist and turn.There are two pieces of advice I will offer. First, go see the film at a theatre on the big screen. Don't wait for NetFlix. Second, pay attention to every scene and every line. Trust Mr. Nolan to take you on this wild ride. You may be able to figure out the ending (if there even is one), but you will have missed the real point of the film ... how did you get here? Here is a brief synopsis: Leonardo DiCaprio plays an expert thief. He is a thief who steals ideas by infiltrating the dreams of his targets and snatching their ideas. A very wealthy tycoon played by Ken Watanabe hires DiCaprio for a risky project of Inception - the inserting of an idea into the subject's mind through dreams, rather than the stealing of an idea. DiCaprio's team is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (with physical brilliance while lacking gravitational force), Tom Hardy (from Rocknrolla), master chemist Dileep Rao, and new recruit Ellen Page (Juno plays a brilliant architect prodigy with a genius of space and dimension). Cillian Murphy plays the target and Michael Caine is DiCaprio's father in law ... the link between who Leo is now and his previous life with his wife, played hauntingly well by Marion Cotillard.A perfect Nolan touch is Ellen Page's character name - Ariadne. A quick google finds that Ariadne, in Greek mythology, fell in love with Theseus and helped him escape Minotaur's labyrinth. The film is full of mazes and is itself a labyrinth punctuated by a stunning and powerful score by Hans Zimmer. You will find yourself bouncing from dream to reality, jumping into another's dreams, layering dreams upon each other ... oh, and watching a mind-bending special effect as the city of Paris is folded over on top of itself.Clear your mind for 2 and a half hours and let a terrific filmmaker take you on a journey through mindspace that we never really pay attention to. The payoff is dream-like.",9,3,11,18 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," can't blame the butler
","Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't love a good whodunit? Don't we all find a bit of guilty pleasure in being the mastermind who solves a fictitious murder case? Has anyone ever been better at crafting an intricate murder mystery than Agatha Christie? Why all the questions? Well, that's nothing compared to what 'probably the world's greatest detective', Hercule Poirot, must answer amidst the foul play aboard the sleek, luxurious, and snowbound Orient Express.This latest film version has Michael Green (BLADE RUNNER 2049, LOGAN) with the adapted screenplay and Kenneth Branagh directing and starring as the fabulously mustachioed Poirot (with his own take on the iconic super-sleuth). Like the near-perfect 1974 version, this latest adaptation succeeds in capturing the theatricality, while avoiding any stodgy staginess. Director Branagh shot on film and it pays off in both the stunning snow-covered mountains and landscapes, as well as the tight, precisely-blocked interior shots around the exceptional set designs.Fans of the novel will notice some shifting of character names, professions and backgrounds, although the vast majority of the story remains intact  including the early murder that occurs not long after the film ingeniously introduces us to each of the characters. The cast is strong and deep, and in addition to Mr. Branagh, features: Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Dame Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr, Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Lucy Boynton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Olivia Coleman, Sergei Polunin, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. All are suspects – well, except the victim.If you haven't read the novel or seen a previous version, know that the fun is in ride. Follow along as Poirot dispenses zingers throughout, while maintaining a most precise commitment to balance in all things. He is an exacting and fastidious man, and as entertaining as he is skilled in crime solving. Note that the photograph he keeps of his one true love Katherine, is actually a photo of young Emma Thompson (Branagh's real life wife). Enjoy keeping track of the clues and hints, while also tracking the widely diverse personalities, excuses and alibis. Most of the many characters only have a couple of key scenes, and it's quite fun to see what these talented performers make of their moments. Daisy Ridley, Lucy Boynton and Derek Jacobi make the most of their time, while Penelope Cruz overplays hers. Other than Branagh, the star who shines the brightest is Michelle Pfeiffer (fresh off a killer performance in MOTHER!). She continues to remind us just how talented she is, and no, your ears aren't playing tricks  that's Ms. Pfeiffer singing 'Never Forget' (lyrics by Branagh) as the closing credits roll.Ms. Christie's outstanding novel was first published in 1934, and is somewhat based on the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and her own train- riding adventure. It's a wonderful and perplexing read  one that will have you changing your mind multiple times on who you believe to be guilty of murder. There have been numerous movie versions over the years, and none have matched the excellence of director Sidney Lumet's 1974 film with an incredible all-star cast alongside Albert Finney's Poirot. Though this most recent movie doesn't reach the timelessness of that one, no movie can capture the detail and maze- like structure of the novel. It's still quite fun – and a true joy- to see the pages come to life (irony intended) on the big screen.",7,4,12,9 November 2017
Lord of War," I Prefer it My Way
","Greetings again from the darkness. No mystery in why this one is fading into oblivion at the box office. It is a very non-mainstream subject matter that is all but impossible to market to the film-going public. This again proves that a top movie star does not make a hit movie.Writer/Director Andrew Niccol ('Gattaca', 'S1mOne', writer of 'The Terminal') delivers a very visual film considering it is about gun runners. The sight of Nic Cage running around deserts and slums in a tailored suit and crisp white shirt is funny in a sick way. Cage's character seems to have convinced himself that being really good at something is enough, that something doesn't necessarily have to be a 'good' thing. His wife, played by the gorgeous Bridget Moynihan ('The Recruit'; 'I, Robot') understands that no lifestyle is worth failing as a human being.The story is much better than the film allows. There is a bit too much cuteness and wink-wink nudge-nudge going on. The relationship between Cage and his brother, played by Jared Leto (Fight Club', 'Panic Room') is very confusing to them and to the viewer. Ian Holm has a nice turn as Cage's rival arms dealer. Ethan Hawke is actually pretty good as the agent on a mission to shut Cage down.The film tries to make some political statements, but mostly it is a mish mash of seriousness and smart-ass comments. Usually when a film has this much voice over, it is either a cost cutting measure or the story is too difficult to follow. It appears Niccol just wanted to hang his hat on Cage's track record for delivering and didn't trust his own ability to make a stand-up film.Overall, a decent performance from Cage (not his best), a solid supporting cast and some amazing shots of parts of the world most of us will never visit, make this one worth seeing. The opening sequence during the credits is pretty cool as it follows the manufacturing of a single bullet up until the point where it fulfills its destiny. This could easily be the Cage character's lifeline as well.",7,1,6,27 September 2005
Sherlock Holmes," As the Crow Flies
","Greetings again from the darkness. Great literature seldom makes for great cinema. The mediums are vastly different. However great literature, in the right hands, can make for very entertaining cinema. Such is the case with Guy Ritchie's interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest character.Mr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce 'Holmes and Watson'. Here we get dazzling special effects and near super-human feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous, fastidious bore in real life. In fact, he lives more like a frat boy or rock star - replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.What is not missing is Holmes' world class attention to detail. The story here is multi-layered and actually very interesting, if not a bit high-minded and high-concept. The still-under-construction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.Of course, I won't reveal any details of the story other than to say the 'good' guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong, who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine, but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems, they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey's physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too pretty-boy for me, but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills.This is a BIG movie! It is made to be a rollicking good time with tons of popcorn munched. Smaller kids will not be able to follow the story, but anyone who has read a Holmes story (and isn't against a little artistic license) should see the film. It is extremely entertaining and fun to watch.",7,168,260,27 December 2009
WALL·E," Take out the trash
","Greetings again from the darkness. Never got around to seeing this one in the theatre, mostly because an auditorium full of kids makes it genetically impossible for me to relax and concentrate on a movie. Very disappointed now that I didn't make the risky trek.Pixar, and director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life) have somehow taken another step forward in their remarkable animation process. This time we are treated to a warning about our consumptive lifestyle and, even better, a cute little love story.Finding inspiration from an unlikely source - Hello Dolly! VHS tape, Wall-E interprets holding hands as the ultimate level of connection and intimacy. Guess that's what 700 years of picking up trash will do to you. Seriously, the point that a simple gesture is the ultimate connection between two people was once the standard.Seeing the human race lounge around on hover-loungers while taking consumption to a whole new level was funny at first, but then very sad as you realize that's not such a big step from today's kids who eat fast food and play hours of video games, while playtime and physical activity is legislated out of schools.Staying away from the lecture podium, I will say that this is a remarkable animation film, and beyond that a very fine film period. I am confused how kids in the 7-12 age group connect with the two leads, because they just aren't very vocal ... they communicate through emotions (not an easy thing for robots!). But for everyone over 12, the message and delivery are stunning.",7,1,4,11 January 2009
The Good Shepherd," Proper Buttons
","Greetings again from the darkness. This one sure looks and feels like masterpiece film-making. It has a tremendous cast, renowned screenwriter (Eric Roth), passionate director (Robert DeNiro) and a near fool-proof subject ... the birth of the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe these are the reasons many are rating the film so highly. As an avid movie goer, I can usually connect with at least one character in a film, especially a THREE HOUR one! Not here, this film treats the viewer unfairly. It requires us to think and pay attention and think some more. For what? There is no payoff. All we get is an empty story, numerous time frame jumps and a bunch of characters who all seem to be playing a part in a school play.What prevents it from being totally ridiculous is the professional approach the cast takes. Only a couple of scenes are over the top, while most are actually so subtle that I found myself wanting to yell at the screen. Matt Damon is near robotic in his performance and when they show him walking, I couldn't help but think of 'Hands' in 'Boston Legal'. And what's with Angelina? Was she supposed to be 20 or 40? Couldn't tell most of the time. This film has more whispering than any Junior High history class and William Hurt takes mumbling to a whole new level. The manner in which Alec Baldwin's character just kind of appears from time to time made me think it was some SNL skit and what kind of casting puts Billy Crudup as a Brit? Aren't there sufficient working British actors to play this simple role? The rest of the cast is rounded out by DeNiro (appearing only a couple of times), Michael Gambon, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro and one all too brief scene with a very Italian Joe Pesci.Sadly, all of this is not enough to save what could have been a mesmerizing tale of espionage and intrigue. It was cool to have legitimate news reels of Castro and JFK, but the film really sagged during the 'movie' parts. Very disappointing.",6,1,3,31 December 2006
Arrival," the language of cinema
","Greetings again from the darkness. Our cinematic love affair with aliens goes back decades, and these films typically fall into one of two categories: evil aliens attack earth, or aliens come in peace and humans react poorly. We've seen aliens trying to provide us with righteous advice (The Day the Earth Stood Still, 1951). We've connected via a few musical notes (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 1977) and radio frequencies (Contact, 1997). And we have certainly had our share of surprise and unwanted meetings (Alien, 1979; The Thing, 1982). Leave it to cutting edge director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Incendies) to find a new, more head-and-soul approach for the genre.This high concept project is born from Eric Hiesserer's screenplay of Ted Chiang's short story 'Story of Your Life'  a title that makes sense by the end of the movie, but one a bit too blah for a big time production with Oscar hopes. Five time Oscar nominee Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a renowned linguist and interpreter. There is an interesting and well done sequence at the beginning of the film that provides the back story for her character and the foundation for the final reveal.A dozen oddly shaped spaceships have docked (mid-air) at various points around the globe. The one in the U.S. is hovering over  no, not Area 51  Montana of all places. Forest Whitaker plays the military officer charged with assembling the team that will try to communicate with the aliens. He chooses Dr. Banks due to her remarkable track record with languages. She is joined with uber-Science and Math guy, Physicist Ian Donnelly played by Jeremy Renner.We do see the aliens and their artsy style of communicating (a touch of Rorschach), but this is about so much more than learning a new inner-galactic language. It's about how the military reacts, how the general populace reacts, how the world leaders work together (or not), and even how the military, intelligence agencies and academia coexist. It's about smart people working out a plan when the problem isn't even clear  a between-the-ears head-scratcher.Mr. Villeneuve utilizes what appear to be flashbacks in helping us better understand Dr. Banks, but the element of time may not be what we typically accept in story-telling. The story, characters, cinematography and score (one of the best matches of music and movie all year thanks to composer Johann Johansson) work together to provide an engaging, nearly hypnotic movie going experience. Plus, I'm fairly certain this is the first alien movie to reference Abbott and Costello and crack a Sheila Easton joke. This is beautiful filmmaking that is also thought-provoking and encouraging of some species self-analysis (our species).",8,5,14,10 November 2016
The Terminal," Do you have an appointment?
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Not sure if this is a comedy, drama or offbeat romance.  It is some parts all of the above and other parts of not much.  $pielberg takes a great story and provides us his usual glimpses of film brilliance surrounded in his always present feel-good fluff.  Hanks' character is fascinating - funny, brilliant, observant and caring.  The subject terminal could have provided so much more insight into human interaction, but instead relies on too common stereotypes.  I loved the story line of Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana, but it gets ruined by a ridiculous plot twist from an episode of 'Fantasy Island'.  Zeta-Jones' story is so pathetic, I was cringing with the dialogue almost from the first moment. How many times can she say 'stay away from me'?  It seemed limitless.  OK, enough with the wet floor jokes.  How about some more of the scenes with Hanks and Tucci - that was the meat of the story if one were to ignore the terminal possibilities.  As usual an OK film by Spielberg leaves us feeling a little empty and cheated.",7,0,2,21 June 2004
The Blind Side," Rebel, Rebel
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Sandra Bullock factor kept me away from this for the the first month. I just couldn't bring myself to watch her same old lame act one more time - especially since she has already been in about 12 movies this year. Wow, what a pleasant surprise this was.Based on the amazing story of Michael Oher, Bullock delivers her best work in years, maybe ever. On top of that, Quinton Aaron is terrific as Mr. Oher. The bond is uplifting and believable. Yes, it has some fluff and mass appeal formula, but it is certainly watchable and quite enjoyable.We see very little of Oher's roots and the high school football coach is miscast and tough to watch, but those are the only minor quibbles I have with an otherwise fine movie that will (and already has) appealed to a wide audience. I often worry about my film snobbishness, but I bought off on this one and thanks go to director John Lee Hancock (The Alamo) for teetering, but not falling into full blown chick flick.",6,1,1,11 December 2009
Parasite," brilliant cinema
","Greetings again from the darkness. At least once per year, a movie really hits a sweet spot ... something that is fun to watch and not really like anything we've previously seen. Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho's latest film is this year's cinematic surprise. It's filled with interesting characters, social commentary, a unique setting, a creative and twisty story, and enough tension that we are left stunned as the end credits roll. There have already been a few excellent movies this year, and this is surely to be a memorable addition to the best of 2019.We first meet the Kims, a family in poverty living in near-squalor in a basement level apartment with one small window. That window is at street level and allows a bit of natural light to leak in, and also provides a too-clear view of drunks targeting the window as they relieve themselves. The family keeps the window open for free fumigation as the city sprayers drive past, in hopes that it will get rid of the pesky stink bug infestation (yes, there is symmetry to this later in the story). The Kim family consists of Dad (Kang-ho Song), Mother (Hye-jin Jang), teenage son Kevin/Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) and 20-something daughter Jessica/Ki-jung (So-dam Park), and they react strongly when they lose 'free hi-fi' access from a neighbor's system. The family seems to make just enough money for their next meal despite somehow underperforming at their family job of folding pizza boxes for a local vendor.Fortunes begin to change for the Kims when one of Kevin's friends ask him to take over tutoring a teenage girl for a wealthy family in town. This sets off an ingenious and sometimes quite funny chain of events that result in all four Kim family members working in some capacity for the Parks, the aforementioned wealthy family. The Park's home was designed by a famous architect and it is a stunning modern hillside home with lush garden and a window that stands in stark contrast to that little window in the Kim's city apartment. Mr. Park (Sun-kyun Lee) is a 1% tech titan married to a high-strung woman who is an eternally anxious and over-matched mom (a fantastic Yeo-jeong Jo). Their two kids are lustful teenage daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung) and hyperactive young son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung).It's fascinating to watch how this family of schemers infiltrates this gullible and vulnerable upper class home, and how they so are easily trusted thanks to photoshop skills, Google, and a street-wise understanding of how to read people. The script, co-written by the director and Han Jin Won, explores the co-dependency as the rich depend on the poor for service work, and the poor depend on the rich for jobs and a living wage. Given the film's title, we soon realize that a 'host' may have more than one parasite at any time ... something that plays out in what has to be the wildest film twist of the year, thanks to an all-out performance from Jeong-eun Lee as the Park's long-time housekeeper.The social and class commentaries are spread throughout, and in addition to the window comparisons, you'll also notice that the walk is uphill to the Parks' home and downhill (and flood-risky) to the Kim's apartment. There are multiple layers within the stories and within the individual characters. What begins as a devastating social satire morphs into a wild and crazy time of violence ... without losing its general theme. A comedy of familial con artists bursts into a violent class thriller - the price to pay for unearned comfort. The film is not just unpredictable, it smacks us with a jarring twist.Bong Joon Ho has become a well-respected filmmaker for his previous work: THE HOST 2006, MOTHER 2009, SNOWPIERCER 2013, and OKJA 2017. This latest elevates him to a whole new level. The film is darkly humorous and unpredictable, with excellent performances throughout. It's also quite something to look at. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong works his magic, and it should be noted that the Park's home is a complete set built solely for the film. I challenge you to notice this - I sure couldn't tell. The film won the 2019 Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, and it is likely headed for many more accolades.",8,3,8,8 November 2019
Rango," Let's Tango with Rango
","Greetings again from the darkness. I just can't believe it. Last year I was raving about Toy Story 3 being my favorite film of the year and now here I am again extolling the excellence of an animated feature. However, Rango is a different experience ... these are all new characters and a whole new look for animation. I would even say this is more a film for grown-ups than for kids, though kids will certainly get a kick out of Rango, a colorful chameleon energetically voiced by Johnny Depp.This story and film pays homage to many classic movies and especially to spaghetti westerns. You will easily spot the tributes to Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, Hunter S Thompson, Sergio Leone, Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood, High Noon, and of course Chinatown. The main story line is nearly identical to Chinatown ... the control of a town's water. Here we get the Mayor, voiced by Ned Beatty, in the John Huston role. For film fans, this is just so much fun! Rango the chameleon is a very likable character who just wants to be liked. He dreams of being a hero so that people will look up to him. Of course, he learns the hard way what being a hero really means. The town of Dirt, the desert, and multitude of characters are all fantastically drawn. There are times the film has a look of live action with terrific lighting and detail.The voice acting in the film is truly outstanding and it starts with Depp's fine work. Also contributing are Ned Beatty (Mayor), Bill Nighy (Rattlesnake Jake), Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Stephen Root, Alfred Molina (Armadillo), Ray Winstone, Charles Fleisher (from 1988 Roger Rabbit) and Timothy Olyphant as the Clint Eastwood character no-named Spirit of the West. There is also a useful and very funny Mariachi band that pops up periodically to push the story along.Director Gore Verbinski is known best for his Pirates of the Caribbean movies (with Depp) and he really gets to go all out on his visual style here. He is helped along by George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and their first foray into animation. Heads up Pixar ... you have definitely have some tough competition!",8,2,7,6 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," It's a Bird, It's Insane
","Greetings again from the darkness. Hollywood versus Broadway. Screen versus Stage. It's always been a bit Hatfield's and McCoy's. The basic argument comes down to celebrity versus artistic merit. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu blurs the lines with his most creative and daring project to date. It's also his funniest, but that's not really saying much since his resume includes Babel, 21 Grams and Amores Perros.The basic story involves a former Hollywood actor well known for playing a superhero (Birdman) many years ago. Riggan is played by Michael Keaton, who you might recall garnered fame playing Batman many years ago. While the parallels are obvious, it's quickly forgotten thanks to a majestic performance from Mr. Keaton. Riggan is trying to prove something to himself and the world by writing, directing and starring in a stage production of Raymond Carver's short story 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'.Riggan's quest runs into every imaginable obstacle, not the least of which is his own internal struggle with his ego ... voiced by his former Birdman character. This could have been a more detailed exploratory view of the creative ego, but we also have money issues, casting issues, personal issues, professional issues and family issues.Zach Galifianakis plays Riggan's best friend-agent-lawyer, and is the film's most grounded character. Yes, you can read the sentence again. A slimmed down Zach perfectly captures the highs and lows of the guy charged with juggling the creative egos and the business requirements of the production. Naomi Watts plays the exceedingly nervous and emotional film star making her stage debut, while her boyfriend and co-star is played by Edward Norton who, well, basically plays Edward Norton ... a critically respected method actor who is known to be a royal pain in the keister. Riggan's current squeeze, who is also an actress in the play, is played by Andrea Riseborough who gleefully blindsides him with an announcement that is unwelcome and untimely. Riggan also receives visits from his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) and is employing his fresh-from-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) in an assistant role. As if all of this wasn't enough, a tipsy Riggan botches a pub interaction with an all-powerful stage critic (Lindsay Duncan), and the two trade incisive insults regarding each other's vocation. So all of these characters and worlds collide as the production nears the always stress-inducing opening night.After all of that, it's pretty easy to state that the script is the weakest part of the film. Instead, the directing, cinematography, editing and acting make for one of the most unique movie experiences of all time. Director Inarritu and famed cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the editing team, deliver what appears to be a single take for mostly the entire run of the film. Of course we know it can't possibly be a single take, but it's so seamless that the breaks are never obvious to us as viewers. We have seen a similar approach by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1948 film Rope, but this time it's a frenetic pace, and the maze-like setting in the bowels of NYC's St James Theatre that makes this one a spectacular technical achievement.Lubezki won an Oscar for his camera work on Gravity, and he has also worked on multiple Terrence Malick films, but this is the pinnacle of his career to date. It's impossible to even comprehend the coordination required for the camera work, the actor's lines and marks, the on que jazz percussion score from Antonio Sanchez, and the fluidity of movement through the narrow halls and doorways of backstage. It's truly a work of art ... whether a stage critic thinks so or not! Most every cinephile will see this one multiple times, but mainstream appeal will certainly not grab ahold. Reality, fantasy, insanity, and morbidity all play a role here and frequently occupy a character simultaneously. These aren't likable people, and the film's crucial scene forces Mr Keaton to speed-walk through Times Square in only his tighty-whities, leaving his character in the proverbial 'naked on stage' situation. It's rare to see such unflattering looks at both the stage and screen worlds, and it's also rare to see such fine performances. Three standouts are Keaton, Norton and Stone. If the industry can avoid presenting awards to itself for 'cartoons and pornography', these three should all capture Oscar nominations.Beyond that, director Inarritu, cinematographer Lubezki, and composer Sanchez deserve special recognition for their incredibly complex technical achievements. For those who complain that Hollywoood only produces re-treads, sequels and superhero movies, take a walk on the wild side and give this one a shot. You may not love it, but you'll likely admire it.",8,10,22,25 October 2014
The Big Short," Close to home
","Greetings again from the darkness. Since there are so few subjects more hilarious than the 2008 financial crisis, let's get the writer/director of Anchorman and Step Brothers to adapt the Michael Lewis best-selling book. OK, so it's improbable that was the thought process, but kudos to whomever was responsible for bringing Adam McKay to the project. Before you go assuming it's a poor fit, it should be noted that McKay is also one of the creative minds behind 'Funny or Die', a site filled with political and social satire. It's that satirical approach that makes this explanation of what went wrong so accessible to the masses. Make no mistake  this is entertaining and educational and thought-provoking and nauseating and infuriating and funny and disheartening.If the film were described as a tutorial on MBS (Mortgage-backed Securities), CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligations), Credit Default Swaps, Tranches, Bond Ratings, and Sub-Prime ARMs, most people's eyes would glaze over and they would keep skimming for showtimes of other new movie releases. In truth, it is those things – and so much more. This is the story of how the housing market collapsed leading the government to the massive bailout that saved some of our largest financial institutions  and how a small group of people recognized what was happening and literally bet against the U.S. economy. It follows the bread crumbs to re-assemble the slow process of spotting the fault in the analysis that lead to massive corruption that finally crossed over into systematic fraud  and does so by using creative presentation approaches like a Bond Rating game of Jenga, and celebrity snippets for definitions and examples.Ryan Gosling stars as Jared Vennett (based on Greg Lippmann), a slick Deutsche Bank trader who acts as our guide through the muck of shorting securitized mortgages, while simultaneously working the system for his personal benefit. He works with Mark Baum (a character based on Steve Eisman, played by Steve Carell) who manages FrontPoint Partners, and Baum's team played by Rafe Spall, Hamish Linklater and Jeremy Strong (whom you might remember as Lee Harvey Oswald in Parkland). While this is going on, there are two other similar story lines we are following. The first is Christian Bale playing hedge fund manager and savant analyst Dr. Michael Burry at Scion Hedge Fund. Burry is often cited as the first to recognize the impending collapse and invest against the market. Finally, we have the 'garage band' investment company based on Cornwall Capital run by (names changed) Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Gellar (John Magaro) with a big boost from former trader Ben Rickert (played by Brad Pitt in a role based on Ben Hockett). The stellar cast is rounded out by Marisa Tomei as Baum's concerned wife, Tracy Letts as the head of Scion, Max Greenfield and Billy Magnussen who play cocky and clueless subprime mortgage brokers, and Melissa Leo who plays a Standard & Poor's employee.It's difficult to tell this story without casting blame, and few escape the wrath of Lewis, McKay and co-writer Charles Randolph. Those absorbing shots to the bow include: the Federal Reserve, the SEC, Rating Agencies, big Banks and Investment firms, Fund Managers, Traders, Realtors, and Mortgage Brokers. Companies specifically named include JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, WAMU, Option One, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and The Wall Street Journal. The point made is that the problem goes/went beyond greed, and is/was truly system-wide, with each segment protecting themselves and their turf. Somehow the name Barney Frank is not mentioned, and FNMA and FHLMC escape mostly unscathed, while CRA lending requirements are not discussed. It's not politically correct (and not mentioned here) to question why so many borrowers who couldn't pay their rent regularly accepted loans that they knowingly couldn't afford to repay. But that's a topic for another time.With full disclosure, I will admit to having been in the mortgage business for 18 years. Though I was never involved with subprime loans, I will always disagree with the stance that the industry and institutions were not aware of the risk and impending collapse. It was common knowledge that 'no doc' loans were absurd, and the adjustable rate schedules and prepayment penalties for subprime (and some conventional) loans were beyond impractical and more like homicidal (from a lending perspective). In the film, Baum interviews an exotic dancer who owns multiple homes  all loans made with minimal documentation due to the cash basis of her business. The terms of the loans set her, and other similar borrowers, up for financial ruin  right along with the housing sector and economy. The subprime mortgage brokers portrayed by Max Greenfield and Billy Magnussen may seem cartoonish, but Baum's confusion with their 'confession' versus 'bragging' is spot on. There were many just like these two clowns who considered themselves 'rock stars', when in fact, there were really 'bartenders who now own a boat'. These weren't the type to question whether the loans made sense  only how many could they close to pad their 5 and 6 figure per month income levels. Of course, in defense of these morons, it was the banks and lenders who designed the loan programs to 'feed the machine' with more and by necessity, higher risk loans  to the point where it was no longer possible to spread the risk wide enough for protection. Hence, the collapse.By the end of the movie, you should expect to have a headache and feel quite cynical towards the system. Despite the humor interjected by quick-hit segments from Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdoin, the seriousness of the topics is more than bubble baths, blackjack and fish stew. The film leaves us angry and nauseous from what happened in 2008, but more importantly questioning  Has anything changed? Have we learned anything? These answers are likely to cause a more sickening reaction than looking back seven years.",8,10,17,24 December 2015
The Conjuring," The Warren Files
","Greetings again from the darkness. The overdose of reality TV the past decade has resulted in at least a couple of Ghost Hunter type shows. Surely you have stumbled on at least one of these. Director James Wan starts this latest haunted house adventure off with the all-too-familiar 'Based on a True Story' and then proceeds to fill the next couple of hours with scene after scene of horror film staples ... things we have jumped at many times over the years. However, this one is bumped up a notch thanks to atmosphere, direction and acting ability.The Perron family has moved to the country for a 'fresh start' and here is what we learn: 1. If the family dog won't enter the new house, then neither should you or your kids. It's time to move out. How many dogs aren't thrilled to follow the kids right in through the front door? 2. If all the clocks (electric and wind-up) stop at exactly the same time, it's time to move out.3. If you stumble on a boarded up cellar/basement, just leave it boarded up ... and it's time to move out.4. If multiple birds fly full speed into your house, breaking their necks, it's time to move out.5. If your daughter discovers an antique toy that carries around as she talks to her new imaginary friend ... it's time to move out.6. If, over two consecutive evenings, your sleepwalking daughter bangs her head into the armoire left by the previous owners, it's time to move out.7. Having 5 daughters seems to make parenting exceptionally difficult. This is no reason to move out of the house.8. Playing blindfolded 'Hide and Clap' is not an appropriate game when you live in a 3 level home. This is no reason to move out, just find a game that doesn't require a blindfold.9. If you ever have to call demonologists to your home, there is no need to get defensive about not being a religious family. Just move out of the house.Director Wan gives us tastes of the haunted house/possession Big 3: The Exorcist, Poltergeist and Amityville Horror. It's not at the level of these, but it's certainly better than most horror films of the past two decades ... at least we don't get any stupid teenagers wandering through the woods. In fact, this one plays right off our natural tendency to feel safe and secure while surrounded by our family within the confines of our own home. The biggest scares come from the moments we are most relaxed.There are no spinning heads or pea soup, and the gore factor is exceptionally low considering Mr. Wan directed Saw, the film that kicked off torture-fest movie genre. The acting here is really good for a horror film. Patrick Wilson also starred in Wan's Insidious, and here he plays Ed Warren. With his clairvoyant wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga), the Warrens are well known ghostbusters, ghost hunters, demonologists, or whatever label you care to apply. We learn about their most famous case regarding Annaelle the doll, and we also see how they save a trophy from each of their cases ... and store it in their home (a seemingly dumb move). Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston are also strong in their roles as the Perron parents. Another thing I liked was that the kids seem like real kids ... especially the recognizable Joey King and MacKenzie Foy.Horror and Comedy are both at the mercy of personal taste. It takes talent to direct a horror movie and not really introduce any new 'gotcha's', but still keep the viewers grabbing the armrests. So enjoy the jumps, cover your eyes, and keep in mind ... if your dog won't enter your new house, it's time to move out!",7,1,3,21 July 2013
Prometheus," Where did you come from, where did you go?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ridley Scott jumps back into the sci-fi genre 30 plus years after his two classics: Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982). Since then, he has avoided sci-fi and had some ups (Gladiator, American Gangster) and some downs (too many to list). Of course, in the film world, one need only create a single masterpiece to be forever worshiped ... and the Alien lovers have always held out hope their master would return. With a sly approach, Mr. Scott has delivered a prequel that should keep the geeks happy, while also having the 'wow' factor to generate multiple viewings.In the year 2089 we witness an archaeologist played by Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) discover an ancient cave map. With remarkable efficiency, four years later, the Prometheus space ship is landing on the moon depicted in the drawings. It's mission is to discover the origin of life. The crew make-up is almost identical to the crew in Alien, only this time we get an ice queen corporate director, played by Charlize Theron, to emphasize corporate greed and the lack of love for science.Once the ship lands, we pretty much know what the search crew will find. That doesn't ruin the impact of the images. The strength of the movie comes from the visuals and effects. We never doubt that we are in a far away galaxy or that the aliens are real. This is one of the RARE times that the 3D version is recommended. Despite the dulled images caused by the glasses, this one was actually filmed in 3D and the effects really pop a few times.There will be much debate over this film because it looks effectively creepy and fascinating ... downright phenomenal. However, it has many of what I call 'stupid movie character moments'. You know, those times when a character does or says something that just makes no sense - other than to create an opportunity for the filmmaker? There are plenty of those present here. The script is co-written by Jon Spaihts and 'Lost' guru Damon Lindelof. The overall idea is brilliant and worth pursuing, however, the details and gaps are quite disappointing. We know there will be minor characters sacrificed in the name of creating fear in the survivors, but couldn't we have more than one strong character? The Noomi Rapace character has much in common with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, but the others here are pretty generic.Idris Elba plays the ship's captain, Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the old man funding the mission and seeking immortality, and Logan Marshall-Green plays Rapace's partner and lover. The only other character of interest is Michael Fassbender's android David. He models himself after Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, right down to the golden locks. Android technology has come a long way since Alien and David can be quite a wry smart-ass.In the end, the sci-fi geeks will decide if this one deserves to live on, but for me, despite the breath-taking technological effects, it's not at the level of Alien. It was kind of humorous to hear a score that bears an uncanny resemblance at times to the iconic score of Inception. It seems that film's impact is nothing short of never-ending.",7,3,6,9 June 2012
The Water Diviner," The Father who went Looking
","Greetings again from the darkness. The lure of the director's chair is sometimes too much for A-list actors to avoid. We have watched Mel Gibson, Angelina Jolie and Kevin Costner have success behind the camera, and now we get Russell Crowe with a story tied to his roots in Australia. The film is scheduled to open in conjunction with the 100th Anniversary of ANZAC Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps), a day of national pride and remembrance.Mr. Crowe also stars as Connor, an Australian farmer with a gift for finding water sources in the outback – hence the title. Connor and his grieving wife lost all three of their sons in the Battle of Gallipoli, when Britain and Allies invaded Turkey, resulting in the death of more than 100,000. Four years after the battle, Connor is forced to try and fulfill the promise he made his wife  travel to Turkey, find the bodies of their sons, and bring them home for proper burial.Director Crowe, working with Oscar-winning cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), delivers a film that looks exceptional  both in its widescreen vastness and beauty, as well as its more intimate moments (though the heavy dose of amber glow is a bit too much early on). Flashbacks play a key role and the battle scenes are brutal and realistic, as is a monstrous sandstorm that engulfs the young sons in a moment designed to convince us that Connor was a protective father, and carries the guilt of allowing them to fight the war.Connor's trip into Turkey allows for the clash of cultures, as he is truly an unwelcome guest and a proverbial fish out of water. If not for the enterprising young boy that guides him through some tough spots, Mr. Connor's trip may have been short-lived. Instead he struggles through clashes with the British, the Greeks and especially Turkish Major Hasan (an excellent Yilmaz Erdogan).While the cultural and personality clashes are entertaining, the stereotypes and simplifications are somewhat tougher to accept. A romantic interlude with the hotel owner (Olga Kurylenko) is maybe the most out-of-place segment of a dramatic movie we have seen in awhile. Crowe and Kurylenko are both fine actors, but this makes little sense and distracts from Connor's mission. We can only assume the Producers demanded a little romance to offset the downbeat war segments and cash in on Crowe.Crowe shows promise as a director, and if the film has any box office success, we can hope he will have a bit more input into what stays and what goes in his next project.",5,8,16,25 April 2015
Despicable Me," Uni-Corny
","Greetings again from the darkness. Can't imagine there ever will be, but if there were to be a court trial against Pixar claiming unfair world animation domination, 'Despicable Me' would surely be logged as Evidence A. Having the unfortunate luck of being released in the same year as Pixar's masterpiece 'Toy Story 3', this is a fine children's film, but just no match.I am happy to report that the kids in the theatre seemed to respond very well to this one ... especially the Minions. If you have been to a movie in the past year, you have probably been exposed to the Minions - a group of cute, yellow tennis ball-looking creatures with either one or two eyes, a unique squeaking language and an infectious giggle/laugh. I found them to be the highlight of the movie as well.Basic story has Gru (Steve Carell voice) on a mission to be the world's best villain. He has had some success, but has been a financial disaster. We learn this when he visits the Bank of Evil and they reject his loan for his newest project - stealing the moon! Gru is in competition with a new, younger evil mastermind named Vector (Jason Segel voice). Gru and his inventor Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) are a step behind in technology, but manage to come up with a strategy.The plan involves cookie-selling orphans who Gru adopts. The story is pretty simple in that he initially plans to use them to trap Vector, but of course, Gru is the one who has his heart stolen by the 3 girls.It's mostly a cute presentation of a very simple story. Younger kids will get a kick out of it ... and don't seem to be as annoyed at Steve Carell's odd accent as I was. It comes across as a cross between Russian and German, but is easily enough understood.Don't expect the brilliance of Pixar, but it will entertain the youngsters.",6,2,6,26 July 2010
Marriage Story," masterful story telling and acting
","Greetings again from the darkness. Nicole has already made her decision. The film opens with her and husband Charlie in a therapy session. They are listing traits they admire about the other person. Watching this, we are unsure if the therapist thinks this exercise might salvage a broken marriage, or if it's some cruel way of highlighting what is being lost. This is writer-director Noah Baumbach's most gut-wrenching film to date, and it's based, at least partially, on his split from wife Jennifer Jason Leigh. Writing about personal experience is nothing new for Baumbach, as THE SQUID AND THE WHALE was inspired by his parents' divorce.Charlie (Adam Driver) is an up-and-coming theatre director in New York City, and wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is the company's lead actor. When Nicole informs Charlie that she wants a divorce, and is headed back home to Los Angeles to be with family and resume her TV acting career, he is stunned. She explains that her dreams and ambitions have been stifled by focusing on his career, and despite her numerous attempts to discuss this, he has never bothered to take her seriously. Oh, and she's taking their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) with her.What follows is a masterclass in writing, acting, directing, editing, and human nature. We watch as Nicole builds the foundation of her new life, while Charlie is staggered - not so much in denial, as disbelief. Their initial course of an amicable split, equitable division of belongings, and shared/split custody of Henry is abruptly altered when Nicole takes counsel from powerhouse LA divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw. Complicating matters is the bi-coastal nature of the divorce and California laws. This forces Charlie to meet with attorney Bert Spitz (a terrific Alan Alda), who may or may not be up to the task - his acumen varying from day to day.Baumbach allows both sides to play out. These are basically normal, good people in a situation that brings out the worst traits in both. Unsparing pain arises at every turn. One particular argument between Charlie and Nicole is the axis on which the movie turns. It's a spilling of guts and filled with devastating honesty. The scene is relentless and builds to a breakdown or breakthrough ... any description leaves us spent. Just when we don't believe we can handle any more emotional turmoil, up pops a moment of genuine tenderness that restores our faith - even if it's only long enough for us to breathe again. There are even some surprisingly funny (dark humor) moments sprinkled throughout, just as there is in life.Supporting roles are filled beautifully by Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Merritt Weaver and Wallace Shawn. As Henry, Azhy Robertson avoids the 'cute-kid' syndrome and delivers an actual nuanced performance by a child actor. Although it seems they are both everywhere these days, Ms. Johansson and Mr. Driver are truly outstanding in their roles here. Scarlet perfectly captures a woman moving on, while Adam singing Stephen Sondheim's 'Being Alive' at the bar in front of his theatre company is one of the most poignant on screen moments of the year.There have been some amazing movies about marriage/divorce over the years. Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1974), Benton's KRAMER VS KRAMER (1979), and Farhadi's A SEPARATION (2011) come to mind. Baumbach's latest belongs in that group. Even the 'best' divorces - those where both sides end up better off - are a 'loss' for both parties. At a minimum, it's a loss of a once-in-time vision of life partnership. The division of assets is a cold term for the shredding of emotions. We are fine with whatever the adults decide as long as the priority for both is their young son who shouldn't pay the price for their debacle ... but certainly will, just as countless other children have. I'm only now able to write about this film after seeing it at the inaugural North Texas Film Festival (NTXFF). As a movie lover, I'm in awe of the acting and storytelling. As a human being, it temporarily destroyed me.",9,10,25,6 December 2019
The Queen," There are no real Fairy Tales
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'And the Oscar goes to ... Helen Mirren'. It appears the talented and charming star of such films as 'Calendar Girls' and 'Gosford Park' may just hear those words in 2007. She captures the spirit, look and nuances of Queen Elizabeth II in this behind the scenes peek at the clashes between the government and monarchy in the few days after Princess Di's death.There could have been no better selection for director than full Brit, Stephen Frears who is known for such fine films as 'Mrs. Henderson Presents' and 'Dangerous Liasons'. We never doubt for a moment, Frears love of his homeland nor his insight into the public confusion in regards to the royal snubbing of Diana and the citizens in those first painful days. He does make a bit of a hero out of newly elected Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (an effective, if slightly over the top performance by Michael Sheen). Blair does speak many of the lines that were in the thoughts of the world at that time ... such as 'Somebody save these people from themselves'.By mixing in real news video and grainy recreations of the Royal Family, Frears does a nice job of putting us back in 1997. Casting for the Royal Family is completed by Sylvia Syms as The Queen Mother, James Cromwell as a slightly daft Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as a very caring a weak Prince Charles, who seems to understand the issues, but lacks the back bone to make it happen.This is without a doubt Helen Mirren's moment to shine and she is downright chilling at times. How odd to see an authoritative figure who really only seems at ease and happy when walking her well trained dogs. Fifty years of putting up a front in which you believe so strongly, but is so out of touch with one's world is quite a burden. Of course, as an American I am only an outside observer to the whole situation, but I do feel Mr. Frears captures the chasm between the masses and the Monarchy.",8,1,2,22 October 2006
Blow," Blow Bites
","Greetings again from the darkness.  All I can figure is that relatives of George Jung wrote the screenplay. This has to be the most sympathetic portrayal of a money hungry drug dealing scumbag I have ever been subjected to.  First of all it is based on a true story and many of us remember when Jung went down for real.  This was no easy going guy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Please.  Look at the way the characters are written.  Are we supposed to believe that his mom is to blame or his true friends rolled over on him.  Hello ... these true friends are DRUG DEALERS. Ted Demme's direction proves he is still not ready for the big time. Gorgeous Penelope Cruz does nothing with her joke of a role.  Jung's mom is played by an over the top Rachel Griffith (who was excellent in 1998's Hilary & Jackie).  The only touch of realism is provided by Ethan Suplee (from Remember the Titans) as fun-loving, easy going Tuna.  He seems to enjoy the freedom provided by California and drug dealing, and is smart enough to bolt before everything 'blows'.  Paul Reubens is supposed to capture and break our hearts in the over-written role of gay mastermind. Gosh I hate this movie the more I think about it.  I will say Johnny Depp continues to impress with his acting ability, but don't see this one ... go rent 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' instead.",6,1,2,27 April 2001
1408," We've Only Just Begun
","Greetings again from the darkness. Leave it to Stephen King to provide the source material for a quality horror/thriller that is set apart from the masses by a multi-level story that is actually interesting and entertaining. Director Mikael Hafstrom ('Derailed') handles the tension pretty well.John Cusack, at his most cynical, is on screen nearly every moment of the movie. He definitely brought his A game with him, probably thankful that his character is a bit beaten down rather than his usual overly-energetic and cutesy. As a researcher and writer of spiritual phenomenon, he long ago gave up hope of reaching the afterworld.Welcome to hotel manager Samuel L. Jackson's worst weekend getaway ... Room 1408 at the Dolphin. In what would be the worst hour for any of us, Room 1408 systematically proceeds to drive Cusack to insanity and suicide. What really makes this one click is the mental side of the story ... a King specialty. Most horror writers forget, or are not talented enough, to write stories that stimulate the brain ... they only goes for the visuals.Even though Cusack hogs the screen time, some support work is provided by a creepy Samuel L. Jackson, Mary McCormack (Russell Crowe's wife in 'Mystery, Alaska'), Tony Shalhoub ('Monk') and Jasmine Jessica Anthony as Cusack's dead daughter. Oh yeah, and a supporting nod must go to Karen and Richard Carpenter's 'We've Only Just Begun' which will stick in your brain for the rest of the day.",7,2,4,24 June 2007
Taken 2," where is my shoe phone?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Four years ago 'Taken' was a huge, surprise hit filled with heart-pumping action and a thrilling plot. The sequel boasts a budget more than three times the size of the original, the same key cast members (especially Liam Neeson), the same screenwriter (Luc Besson), and a similar type story. So why doesn't it work this time? The answer is inferior direction, no surprises, and too many absurd moments to count.Liam Neeson returns as former CIA-stud Bryan Mills, father to Kim (Maggie Grace) whom he rescued from Albanian sex-traffickers in Paris. Famke Janssen also returns as Leonore, Kim's mother and Bryan's ex. Somehow, Leonore and Kim think it's a great idea to surprise Bryan with a visit while he is on a security job in Istanbul. Yes, right next door to Albania. Since the film opens with a mass funeral depicting the burial of all the guys Bryan killed in the first movie, and Rade Serbedzija vows revenge, it comes as little surprise when Bryan and Leonore are 'taken'.What is surprising is that the filmmakers attempt to turn Maggie Grace into an action hero. Yes, gangly Maggie Grace who we saw hiding under the bed in the first film. This time, unable to pass the driving test to obtain her license, she transforms into master stunt driver and Olympic rooftop sprinter ... while deploying grenades with Swiss perfect timing. I should also mention that in real life Maggie Grace is 29 years old. She was supposedly 17 in the first movie and 18-19 here. Yes, one of my movie pet peeves.In a film like this, we can always hope the action sequences cover-up the ludicrous script (see most Jason Statham movies). Unfortunately, we are abused with chopped up camera work that we often can't tell who is punching who are whose gun is firing. These action shots make the fight scenes in Batman Begins or the Bourne movies appear slo-motion. It's a waste of Liam Neeson and a potential stellar bad guy in Mr. Serdebzija (The Saint). The final irritant is Janssen's role as Leonore. She is reduced to sobbing and passing out (sometimes while wearing a hood). Just another waste.There are two types of sequels: those that build on the best points of the first and those that simply cash in. Clearly, this one falls into the cashing-in column. Don't expect any long-lived quotes from this sequel. It has no particular set of skills. (www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com)",4,2,2,21 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Chasing Shadows
","Greetings again from the darkness. The quest for quality horror films is a never-ending project. Since low budget fright fests are the easiest way to make money in Hollywood, most take shortcuts that leave us feeling cheated. This remake of a 1989 British TV horror film actually has wonderful production design ... the Gothic mansion is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, the shortcut here was a story that offers little substance.Daniel Radcliffe (yes, Harry Potter himself) plays a young, widowed solicitor named Arthur Kipps, who is still grief stricken, and now on the verge of losing his job. He is given one last chance to prove his mettle by going to a remote village to settle the affairs of recently deceased client. His young son (Misha Handley) and his nanny are to meet him in the village a few days later.The local townspeople clearly don't want him there and are constantly trying to shoo him back to London. Of course, no one ever bothers to tell him why they are frightened and why they are so angry with him for going to the old house. This mansion is a work of art. It has the necessary creep factor to star in a real horror film. The furnishings and fixtures and decor are really the star of the movie. It's not giving away anything to say that every time Radcliffe sees this mysterious woman in black, something bad happens in the village.The annoying thing about the film is that whenever we get a chill-inducing moment like a shadow in the background or a figure passing by a mirror, it is immediately followed up by a cheap parlor trick involving a sonic blast of music and an ear-piercing scream. It's as if the director (James Watkins) is convinced movie goers are too ignorant to know when to be scared, so he provides clues to say 'Scream now!' Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer add a touch of class to the film as Mr.and Mrs. Daily, who recently lost their son. Mr. Daily has found solace in the bottle, while Mrs. Daily teeters on the brink of insanity. My theory that no film featuring Mr. Hinds can be all bad is tested here, and Ms. McTeer was seen recently as the best thing about the Albert Nobbs film.On a positive note, this is a nice transition movie for Daniel Radcliffe. He has quite a career challenge as he tries to break loose of the Harry Potter clamp. He succeeds here with quite a different physical appearance, though he really has little to do but alternate between a distantly forlorn look and peering cautiously around dark corners. A couple of interesting notes: the boy playing his son is Radcliffe's real life godson, and the actor who played Radcliffe's role in the 1989 original is Adrian Rawlins, who played Harry Potter's father in those movies.",5,15,28,4 February 2012
Vanilla Sky," Ahh, Look at all the lovely people
","Greetings again from the darkness.  OK so we had to wait 11 and a half months for the interesting movies of 2001. I saw 'Vanilla Sky', 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums' over a 4 day span and sit here truly satisfied in my movie going for the first time in more than a year.  At times, 'Vanilla Sky' feels like you are on the runway at a super model convention, but the beauty of the actors does not take away from the tangled web that the screenplay weaves.  I was enthralled by the twists and turns of this wild ride.  Some twists were easier to spot than others, but the recent wave of 'Sixth Sense' wannabe's are put to shame by Cameron Crowe.  Not being a huge fan of Cruise, Cruz or Diaz, it took a remarkable story line to keep me there.  Some nice support work from many, especially Kurt Russell, who looks solidly middle aged for the first time on the big screen.  Cameron Crowe is now a top draw for me.  If he is involved, I am headed to the theatre. He knows a good story and is amazing in his ability to create believable scenes.",8,0,1,30 December 2001
Win Win," WTFIT (Whatever it Takes)
","Greetings again from the darkness. Thomas McCarthy's first two directorial outings were excellent: The Station Agent, The Visitor. This is his third and it seems clear the first two were not flukes. This is a filmmaker who knows what he is doing and who is attracted to real people in real life situations. All three films feature the reactions and adaptations when strangers collide and a family-like atmosphere is created.In this film, Paul Giamatti plays a struggling lawyer who also coaches the local high school wrestling team. Times are tough for Giamatti's practice and when he stumbles on a chance for some 'easy' money, his wrestling match with his conscience doesn't last too long ... even though it is not in the best interest of his client. By taking the easy way out, his elderly client is moved out of his home and into a long-term care facility. Giamatti knows his decision isn't right, so he hides it from his wife, the talented Amy Ryan. Their home life seems very typical until the Giamatti decision leads to further complications ... the client's long-lost grandson shows up.The kid turns out to be quite perceptive and fits right into the Giamatti/Ryan family ... especially when it is discovered that he is a top notch high school wrestler. Newcomer Alex Shaffer was cast because of his wrestling skills, but shines in the film due to his ability to come across as a real kid in real world conflicts. There are times his actions and decisions are more adult than the adults.The grandfather client is played by Burt Young, who was Paulie in the Rocky movies. Giamatti's best friend is played by Bobby Cannavale, whose character is going through marital hell, and whose lively spirit and outspoken tendencies provide many of the laughs in the film. Cannavale shines in this film, much as he did as the slightly desperate vendor in The Station Agent.Things are going along pretty well for the new 'family' until Shaffer's mother (Melanie Lynskey) is released from the drug clinic and she shows up to re-claim her son and her share of grandpa's wealth. She and her attorney (another nice role for Margo Martindale) expose Giamatti's earlier unethical decision and force his hand. The strength of the family is severely tested.What I really like about this and the two previous McCarthy films are that no real Hollywood tricks are used. He hits situations head-on with realistic levels of comedy and uncomfortable people who are just trying to get along in life. In Win Win, the stellar cast brings life to these characters and draw us right in to their attempts at conflict resolution. Even though the theme is not too far removed from that of The Blind Side, Mr. McCarthy provides us with characters who could be from our own lives or even our own families. That makes all the difference.",8,2,4,28 March 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Gotham's Reckoning
","Greetings again from the darkness. If you are a fan of the series, this is a sensational ending to the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. Though replicating Heath Ledger's Joker is not possible, every other piece of this finale worked for me ... and worked exceptionally well. There are critics who are nit-picking, saying that the story is muddled, the villain a letdown, run time too long, the first half is slow or the second half is too traditional in action. My challenge to these critics ... name a better comic book hero film. For me, this is an incredibly entertaining and ambitious film that sets the standard for the genre.In addition to director Nolan, many of the familiar characters are back. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. New to the series are Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Officer Blake, Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, and best of all, Tom Hardy as Bane - the hulking masked monster wreaking havoc on Batman and Gotham.I will not go into any of the plot points other than to say this is the first time we have seen a villain who is at least Batman's match physically and mentally. Bane is a wrecking ball with a general's strategic skills and voice that is begging to impersonated by intoxicated high school boys for years to come. There are a couple of twists that add much fun for the fans of the first two films, including an appearance by a key member of Batman Begins. Also, Michael Caine is given a couple of wonderful scenes to prove he is more than a driver and butler.Since this is Batman, the action scenes have to be analyzed. It should be noted that Batman is not on screen very often, but when he is, it is quite thrilling. We have new toys and weapons, and quite a bit of fisticuffs with Bane and Catwoman that compete with any of the giant firepower scenes.Neither Mr. Nolan nor his DOP Wally Pfister are proponents of 3D (Thank Goodness!!), so instead we get treated to 50 minutes of actual 70mm IMAX footage. This means, if possible, you should catch this on an IMAX screen. I have seen it IMAX and XD, and while both are visually stunning, the IMAX is an overwhelming site at times.The movie picks up 8 years after the ending of The Dark Knight. Harvey Dent is worshiped as a hero, and Bruce Wayne is a Howard Hughes type recluse - broken body and all. The initial aerial sequence is a fun start to a film that runs just under 3 hours. Contrary to some critics, I believe the story is fairly easy to follow and quite intense, thrilling and pure cinematic joy.For those who claim there is a lack of humor ... Exhibit #1: Hines Ward returning a kickoff for a TD. Come on, how long since he was fast enough for that??Note: Though I haven't addressed the Aurora shooting here, I did post a statement on my blog at www.moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com",9,2,7,22 July 2012
Black Panther," an antelope in the headlights
","Greetings again from the darkness. Adaptations of Superheroes, Comic Books, and Graphic Novels have been driving the movie theatre box office for a few years now. Where the financial success of a film was once measured in tens of millions, it's now hundreds of millions. Beyond that, these enormous productions are pressured to make political and social statements ... providing the hope of which real life leaders seem to fail. This latest from Marvel and director Ryan Coogler (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION), carries all of that plus the expectations of an entire gender and race. It's a heavy burden for a comic book character, however it seems, regardless of one's perspective, it's likely the film delivers, satisfies, and ... oh yeah ... entertains.The bar has been set so high for action sequences and special effects, that we take the great for granted and only speak up on those that falter. What allows this film to take its place among the best of the genre is a combination of story depth and the payoff for showing us a world we haven't previously seen. The cultural aspects of the (mythical) African country of Wakanda are not only interesting, but the setting itself is breath-taking. An explosion of color, texture and technology blended with intriguing and multi-dimensional characters bring the film to life and draw us into this wonderland of tradition, culture and humanity.It seems ridiculous to speak of a comic book film in these terms, but the number of talking points raised during its runtime are too many and too varied to discuss in this format. What we can make clear is that it's cool to watch an entire movie where people of color and women are strong, confident, and intelligent. Chadwick Boseman has played Thurgood Marshall (MARSHALL), James Brown (GET ON UP), and Jackie Robinson (42), and here he takes on a fictional icon in King T'Challa/Black Panther. He perfectly captures the pensive nature of a King balancing tradition with the needs of his people to evolve and transition. His chief adversary 'Killmonger' is played terrifically by Michael B Jordan (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION) as a man out for revenge and power. For most movies this head to head battle would be enough ... but not this time.Lupita Nyong'o (Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), Danai Gurira ('The Walking Dead'), and relative newcomer Letitia Wright play Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively; a triumvirate of three of the strongest women you've likely ever seen on screen. Nakia is the love interest, but also carrying out her own humanitarian missions, while also proving to be beyond adequate as a soldier. Okoye is the ultimate warrior and absolutely loyal to her country, while Nakia (T'Challa's sister) is a contemporary version of James Bond's Q - the ultimate technology whiz, and one with the zippiest zingers. Any of these characters could be the basis for a standalone movie, but together they elevate this to something much more than a couple of dudes in sleek suits fighting.Martin Freeman (THE HOBBIT), Daniel Kaluuya (GET OUT), Sterling K Brown ('This is Us'), Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker are all contributors, and Andy Serkis is a frenzied standout in an all-too-brief turn as Klaue. The strong cast delivers even in the few moments when the script lags. In fact, the only piece of this puzzle that didn't seem to fit was the traditional hand-to-hand combat to determine the next king. Why is it that a nation so advanced still relies on primitive courses of decision-making? Perhaps this is merely commentary on our society, though providing a more intellectual solution would have been in line with the rest of the story.The world of Wakanda is stunning. The costumes are sleek, colorful and fascinating. The characters are multi-dimensional. The action sequences are top notch (armored rhinos!). The cinematographer is Rachel Morrison, who recently made history by being the first woman to receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography (MUDBOUND). It's these factors that allow Mr. Coogler's film to achieve the level of importance that most comic book films wouldn't dare to strive for. On top of everything, it accomplishes the one thing I demand from these type of movies ... it's quite fun to watch!",8,20,53,15 February 2018
Iron Man," Obadiah, Ozzie and Oodles of Oooohs
","Greetings again from the darkness. Terrific screen adaptation of Stan Lee's comic creation brings Iron Man to life! Directed by Jon Favreau ('Swingers' and Tony Stark's chauffeur) the film blends extraordinary special effects and CGI with some wonderful acting and explosive action.I have long been an admirer of the talented Robert Downey, Jr ('Chaplin' and 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang') and only wish he could keep it together in real life so he could work more often. Favreau really allows Downey's knack for deadpan wise-cracking to play a huge role in defining Tony Stark ... the brilliant, billionaire, playboy, inventor and business tycoon who becomes Iron Man.Every good comic book hero requires a terrific nemesis and Jeff Bridges is wonderful as a shaved-headed Obadiah Stane (and Iron Monger). Bridges and Downey are both top level actors and definitely bring a touch of class to the film (similar to Christian Bale as Batman). The supporting cast is rounded out by Gwyneth Paltrow (rarely seen on screen these days), Terrence Howard and Paul Bettany (the voice of Jarvis - Tony Stark's home based A.I. system). Creator Stan Lee also has a brief cameo as the guy Stark mistakes for Hugh Hefner (actually a pretty funny moment).The only thing keeping this one from greatness is there were just no surprises or twists in the story. We spot the bad guy early and the story travels a pretty familiar arc. Still ... this one is loads of fun and a visual smörgåsbord. Tip: stay til the end of the credits.",8,1,3,10 May 2008
Mother!," hold on to your butts
","Greetings again from the darkness. Him. Mother. Man. Woman. When those are the identifiers of the four main characters (none have a real name), one might assume that the filmmaker is lazy. However, after watching the latest from the psycho-creative force known as Darren Aronofsky, we understand that names weren't necessary, and even if they had been, he was probably too mentally exhausted from finding ways to torture those characters and confound the viewers. The first half of the film is discomforting and creepy while the second half is downright crazed and deranged. You won't find many story details in this review, as the fun is in the shock. Most of the film is through the eyes of Jennifer Lawrence, and we share her confusion and disoriented state. She is married to a famous poet played by Javier Bardem (yes, the age difference is acknowledged). While she spends her days refurbishing their stunning country home, he battles severe writer's block. Needless to say, their domestic bliss goes wrong  but it's not the kind of wrong we've ever seen before. Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (both Oscar nominees) confine us in excruciatingly tight shots resulting in further disorientation and claustrophobia through most of the film. By the time we get a single wide shot of the home's exterior, we've just about given up hope. And once Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, we kick into full ROSEMARY'S BABY mode  only more frenetic and hyper.It should be noted that it's not a traditional horror film – heck, it's hardly a traditional film at all. It's built on confusion, and metaphors abound. Aronofsky seems intent on causing endless post- viewing discussions and debate over what it 'means'. A case can be made for commentary on ego, fame, Mother Nature, deity/religion, and a sign of the times – the entitled 'takers' of the world. The most obvious explanation is that the price paid for creativity is quite dear, and often causes a release from reality. There is a vicious cycle occurring here and our realization happens after the crescendo of insanity that is the film's peak.WTF moments are too many to count, and Ms. Lawrence pulls off what has to be the roughest on screen pregnancy we've seen. It's a real treat to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in form after being out of the spotlight for four years. The score from Johan Johannsson is remarkable and there are ground-breaking visual effects (easy to miss during the audacious, frenzied second half action). Aronofsky is clearly provoking us, though it's abundantly unclear to what end. His previous twisted, mind- benders include REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and BLACK SWAN  both of which seem like mainstream family fare in comparison. This is a love it or hate it project, and most will likely fall into the latter. But for those who embrace the deranged and audacious, the love will be everlasting.",7,15,35,14 September 2017
Creed II," IVk
","Greetings again from the darkness. The theatre was packed and I don't recall having heard a louder outburst of cheering for any movie moment. Was it predictable? Yes. Did it deliver what the fans wanted? Absolutely. Is it (as my son asked) 'ROCKY IV in 4K?' Yes, that's pretty much exactly what it is. So despite CREED (2015) director Ryan Coogler opting to make BLACK PANTHER instead of this sequel to his own movie, I've seen proof that it's clearly a crowd-pleaser ... which is what the 'Rocky' franchise has always done best.Michael B Jordan returns as Adonis Johnson/Creed and Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky Balboa. And although that would likely be enough, we also have Tessa Thompson as Adonis' girlfriend Bianca and Phylicia Rashad as Adonis' mom, both also from CREED. We see an early training/boxing sequence in Russia featuring (professional boxer and chiseled human mountain) Florian Munteanu as Viktor Drago being trained by his father Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). If you are a fan of the franchise at all, you know exactly where this is headed - and so does opportunistic boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby).Think of it as 'Revenge vs Redemption'. Adonis fighting the son of the man who killed his father Apollo is the obvious revenge side, and Viktor fighting to redeem his disgraced father Ivan, who lost to Rocky 30 some years ago. This one lacks the real world Cold War element of ROCKY IV (1985), and while it's missing the political heft of that film, it still packs quite a punch as a revenge flick ... even if there was no other possible route this sequel could take. If anything, the filmmakers should be commended for not force-feeding any cheesy political statements on today's environment.'What are you fighting for?' This must be both a necessary boxing question to answer and a tough one, as it seems to get asked over and over during the film. The combination of writers: story by Cheo Hodari and Sacha Penn, characters by Ryan Coogler, and screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor, place quite a bit of focus outside the ring. Relationship quandaries are at every turn: young married couples, father-son (double whammy), mother-son (another double whammy), and first time parents.Director Steve Caple Jr seems more comfortable outside the ring himself, as the boxing match camera work does not hit the level of the first, although audience members' emotions run even higher. Perhaps to overcompensate for the more basic camera work, some of the sound effects for rib punches may have been pulled right out of battle scenes in war movies - they sound like explosions, and are exaggerated so that we viewers might 'feel' the ribs cracking.Wisely the relationship between Adonis and Bianca is a key element this time. Mr. Jordan and Ms. Thompson have tremendous chemistry, and the filmmakers deserve credit for hitting the hearing-impaired issue head-on. It's a topic that's rarely seen in movies, and appears to be very well handled. There are some other ties to the 'Rocky' franchise with Wood Harris playing 'Little Duke', son of Duke, played numerous times by Tony Burton throughout the Rocky films, and there are a couple of other (very) familiar faces that pop up from both IV and ROCKY BALBOA (2006). On the music front, Ludwig Goransson is a rising star composer thanks to FRUITVALE STATION, CREED, BLACK PANTHER, VENOM, and now CREED II. He toys with the familiar Rocky numbers, but some will argue not enough.This sequel is more grand scale than the first (which was identity driven), yet more restrained than IV. Sure we have the mandatory zany training montage (zany may be too mild), and the final bout is held in Moscow (even though it makes no sense that the champion would agree to this), but it's definitely more low-key when comparing Bianca's musical intro to James Brown's 'Living in America'.For fans, it's great to see Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago back in the ring together - even if only for a moment; however, maybe not as thrilling (dramatically speaking) as when the two first reunite Godfather-style in a table at Adrian's Café. It's a surreal moment that both Lundgren and Stallone play perfectly - one with pent-up emotional turmoil and the other quite content with what life has delivered. Of course, Sly can play Rocky in his sleep ... and no that wasn't meant to encourage one-liners followed by rim shots. He's comfortable with the shuffles and mumbles of an elderly Rocky and it's a pleasure to watch an old friend. The only real question remaining ... is the 'Creed' franchise gonna fly now?",7,25,49,21 November 2018
Bruce Almighty," Not so mighty Bruce
","Greetings again from the darkness.  High expectations mean more critical grading.  This one really fails to deliver because it was presented as a return to comedy by Jim Carrey.  Very few laughs, other than the obvious gags shown in the previews.  Director Tom Shadyac is making a career of working with the best known comics: Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy.  He seems to have very little control.  Jennifer Anniston shows she may be ready for movie stardom, otherwise not worth 2 hours.",6,0,1,28 May 2003
Casino Royale," Bueno, Muy Bueno
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have never really understood my fascination with Bond as I prefer to think of myself as too intelligent for this type of movie. Maybe it was the great clothes, beautiful women, playing with guns, wonderful toys, fast cars and world travels? Well despite all of the hoopla surrounding this latest Bond production, feel relieved knowing that the 007 franchise is not only safe, but dare I say, better than ever.Daniel Craig (although a bit long in the tooth) plays the just promoted to '00', James Bond, and is flat out terrific! The acting ability he has shown in 'Road to Perdition' and 'Layer Cake' really take the story and script to another level. Sure he can strut and pose and gaze with the best of them (Pierce Brosnan), but Mr. Craig can really ACT, which this somewhat complex script actually demands.The action in the first 20 minutes is heart-pounding and incredibly fast and dangerous. Luckily the pace slows down a bit as the plot develops. Yes, there is a plot and this time it is not world domination. That is good news and bad news. One of the two disappointments in this fine film is the bad guy played by Mads Mikkelsen. He is a fine poker player and pretty evil in his torturing (all males will squirm), but he just lacks the real charisma of the best Bond bad guys over the years. The other disappointment is the underuse of the greatest film theme song ever (yes, better than Star Wars) and the extremely weak Chris Cornell opening credit song.Of course, there are beautiful women. Eva Green as Vespa Lynd is not your typical Bond girl. She is smart and smart-assed and goes toe-to-toe in a couple of ways with Bond. What a nice change of pace to see a woman's role written in a full scale, complex manner. It makes it much more interesting and entertaining.Did I mention fast cars? The brand new Aston Martin is almost as cool as the 1964 model we get a couple of shots of. Since there is no Q, the wonderful toys are not in full swing yet, but the incredible settings in Prague, The Bahamas and Italy more than make up for it. The scenery and architecture are awe inspiring.There may be no Q, but there is definitely an M. Judi Dench reprises her role, this time showing her frustrated side with her newest agent. She recognizes Bond's rare abilities, but worries about his mental state. By the end, she knows he is ready for more.The supporting cast includes the underrated Jeffrey Wright, the always great Giancarlo Giannini and super model Ivana Milicevic in a strange role. The cast is fine and second time Bond director Martin Campbell ('GoldenEye') really lets the action and story and setting do most of the talking. His action scenes are not filled with close ups or rapid fire editing ... we actually get to see the fights and chases. He does a nice job of keeping the viewer in the story. I couldn't help but chuckle as Craig steps out of the waves and onto the beach - almost identical to the classic Ursula Andress scene in 'Dr. No'. Being a huge Sean Connery fan, I find this difficult to say, but here goes ... this is the best Bond movie to date. Wow!",8,8,18,17 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Lotsa Chuckles and Genius
","Greetings again from the darkness. Has there ever been a bad Pixar movie? Nope. And as many really good movies they have created, there are now two truly great ones: Toy Story and Toy Story 3. The first one (released 15 years ago) transformed the way animation is made and set the standard for kids' movies that parents can also enjoy. This third installment takes animated story telling to the next level.Of course all the great voices are back: Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles, Estelle Harris), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and Sarge (R Lee Ermey). Imagine assembling that cast and then adding two fabulous new characters: Lotsa Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), Ken (Michael Keaton; expanding Jodi Benson's Barbi to a key role, and re-vamping Slinky-dog with Blake Clark taking over for his deceased friend, the fabulous Jim Varney. This is major star power and an over-abundance of talent! Then again, we have all seen stellar casts fall flat without a worthy script. Fear not as Pixar legend John Lasseter (Exec Producer here) has passed the reins again to director Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc.). This story is brilliant and engaging. I challenge anyone from age 5 to 95 to avoid being drawn in to the themes of separation, friendship, loyalty, and power.There are some laugh outloud moments along with the usual wise cracks from Buzz and Potato head. This time we are also treated to some darker moments with Lotsa, a power-hungry stuffed bear, and his band of misfits that include a giant baby doll and Chuckles, the creepiest clown this side of Poltergeist, and especially the frightening/funny monkey working security.Some Pixar touches include the voice of Andy is provided by the grown up voice actor who did Andy in the first, a couple of glimpses of the evil kid Sid (first Toy Story) who has grown up to be a garbage man (same shirt) and the re-use of Randy Newman's classic song 'You've Got a Friend in Me'. Too many other 'little' moments to mention, but this is pure film genius and should not be missed.",9,2,3,21 June 2010
La Vie En Rose," The Soul of France
","Greetings again from the darkness. Not really certain what to make of this one. On one hand, it is a remarkable biopic about a fabulous singing talent who lived an extremely troubled life. From a film-making perspective, it is all over the place. At times beautifully filmed, yet the non-linear presentation creates a mess when told over such a short period of time.One thing for sure, Marion Cotillard is truly exceptional as the troubled Edith Piaf. What a transformation Ms. Cotillard makes from the wild, drunken youngster to the broken down, spunky forty-something whom life has blown by. If you doubt the physical transformation, let me remind you that Ms. Cotillard was the beauty from last year's Russell Crowe film, 'A Good Year'.Terrific support work from Sylvie Testud as Piaf's friend Momone, Emmanuelle Seigner as her prostitute-turned-surrogate mother, and Gerard Depardieu as the nightclub owner who first recognizes this stunning talent while she sings on the street for coins.Director Oliver Daham may or may not be a Piaf worshipper. He seems to pull no punches in making the point that she got few breaks in life, but also brought a significant amount of her pain onto herself through drinking and self wallowing. He does capture Piaf's amazing ability to burst through the pain and display the fantastic voice regardless of the moment's challenges. He does his best directing at the house of ill repute where young Edith gets dumped by her dad.The film leaves many of the personal life rumors untouched and only mentions Yves Montand once, and throws in a quick scene with Marelene Dietrich ... both who figure large in those rumors! Regardless, the film is worth watching, if for no other reason that Ms. Cotillard's performance and the amazing Piaf songs.",7,0,0,6 July 2007
Signs," It's time for your close-up Mr. Gibson
","Greetings again from the darkness.  OK can we hold off for awhile with the 'genius' label for M. Night Shyamalan?  Is he talented?  Definitely.  Can he put together a beautifully made film?  Definitely.  Is he the most creative story teller of our time?  Hardly.  'The Sixth Sense' was a very well crafted, twisted, almost mystical film.  The surprise of 'Unbreakable' was obvious from the first half hour, but still enjoyable.  'Signs' brings us another well told story, only this one appears to be a rejected X-Files script - very simplistic.  A couple of nice scares thrown in for fun, but overall this one is a bit boring.  Could Mel have underplayed his character anymore?  Two awfully cute kids help cover-up the straight forward story.  I would also encourage Mr. Shayamalan to not succumb to the Clint Eastwood school of becoming the star in your own movie - it is a distraction and direction will suffer.  If you wish to act, go act in someone else's movie. It is a big jump from cameos to critical roles.  Another outstanding score from James Newton Howard - our best film scorer working today (including John Williams and the caught-in-a-rut Danny Elfman).  Mr. Shayamalan, you are obviously a movie fan who gets paid to make movies.  This is a life many of us only dream of.  We are depending upon you bring something new to the screen every time.  You are set financially - don't let that stagnate you creatively.  The next one is important.",6,0,2,6 August 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody's World
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have enjoyed Mr. Allen's resurgence and obviously Scarlett Johansson has played the role of his muse. VCB takes a step up even from his most recent offerings both because of Allen's writing and the amazing cast.Scarlett teams with Rebecca Hall, a relative unknown in the U.S. (best known for 'The Prestige' and 'Wide Saragasso Sea') to play Cristina and Vicki, two American girls spending the summer in Spain. Scarlett is the free spirit, Rebecca is the engaged, practical one. The film takes off when they are both propositioned by a local painter played brilliantly by Javier Bardem, back in his most macho and amorous element after his trip down psycho road in 'No Country for Old Men'.There are no coin flips for Bardem's character. He wants everything, including both Scarlett and Rebecca. That would be enough for most films, but not for Woody! We are then treated to Bardem's ex-wife, played explosively by Penelope Cruz. She is amazing as the jealous, suicidal artist who transitions into the warm and caring mentor in a very odd communal setting with Scarlett and Javier.What adds the element of Allen brilliance here is the seemingly secondary character of Vicky played by Rebecca Hall. In reality, she is the heart of the story. Feeling trapped into a marriage to a Steve Guttenberg clone played by Chris Messina, Rebecca doesn't know how to handle the awakening since her Javier moment. Woody really pushes us on the topics of love, desire, freedom, loyalty, commitment and marriage. And if you need just an element of creepiness, Rebecca Hall's speech pattern and mannerisms remind me of Woody's-ex, Mia Farrow. Maybe that's why he cast a relative unknown?? Some of Woody's best writing in a long time and a pleasure to watch these fine actors execute. The best scenes are Javier and Penelope, and Javier and Rebecca. Throw in a beautiful soundtrack of Spainish guitar and you have a truly fine film.",8,6,16,18 August 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," I am Myself
","Greetings again from the darkness. Not in the class of 1998's first segment, Cate Blanchett is still a wonder as the virgin Queen. Here she displays much more vulnerability and emotion than in the first, but her weaknesses are a bit too heavy handed. Director Shekhar Kapur is back at the helm, though for some reason he has only made one other film (Four Feathers) since the 1998 Elizabeth.Clive Owen plays swashbuckling Sir Walter Raleigh who charms his way into the Queen's inner circle and more than charms Abbie Cornish (A Good Year), the Queen's personal favorite of her court. Owen adds a bit a cartoonish feel to the film and is definitely shown to be the hero of the holy war. Geoffrey Rush is back as Elizabeth's adviser and he is given a sub-plot with his brother so that he doesn't spend the entire two hours just bowing to Blanchett. The whole Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) story is presented very awkwardly, but the beheading was actually beautifully filmed. Adding to the cartoonish feel was the manner in which Jordi Molla portrays King Philip II of Spain ... very odd.This one manages to cling to epic status through amazing sets, incredibly wonderful wardrobe and a terrific score. Even though it isn't the masterpiece of the first segment, it is still worth seeing and will be involved in Oscar talk.",6,3,5,20 October 2007
Identity," Here Honey, you hold the room key
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Highly anticipated 'thriller' that for the most part, fails to deliver.  More slasher than thriller.  The psychological aspect held great promise and intrigue, but was handled poorly.  Director James Mangold continues with his run of disappointing films, including 'Kate & Leopold', 'Girl, Interrupted' and 'Cop Land'.  He does have some visual style, but lacks the ability to add substance to his work.  Cusack and Liotta are strong in their roles, and Amanda Peet is surprisingly effective as the young dreamer.  The always great Alfred Molina provides excellent work in relief, and an almost unrecognizable Rebecca DeMornay has a quick turn as a a woman who 'used to be that actress'.  Gotta love those that can poke fun at themselves.  Speaking of fun, many of the death scenes generate outloud laughter from the audience due to the unbelievable nature.  Overall this film steals from the best - Psycho, The Omen, The Sixth Sense, Carrie, The Fury and Ten Little Indians.  The problem is those were all very strong scripts that were filmed brilliantly, whereas 'Identity' seems to avoid the one topic that could have provided the film with its own 'identity'.  Focus on the internal battle of personalities could have been the key to setting this one apart.  Instead, it is just another slasher with a nice cast.",6,1,3,28 April 2003
Saving Mr. Banks," The East Wind
","Greetings again from the darkness. Surely it's a coincidence that Disney Studios has released this movie just a few months ahead of the 50th anniversary of the classic Mary Poppins film. Regardless of the promotional angle, the story of Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) going all out to woo stuffy Brit writer PL Travers (Emma Thompson)actually turns out to be a well made and pretty interesting story of two stubborn people butting heads. Even better is a behind the scenes glimpse of the creative process of bringing the Travers book(s) to the big screen.Director John Lee Hancock is the perfect fit with his track record of glossy, feel-good, inspired by true life stories with The Blind Side and The Rookie. We never lose sight that this is a Disney production of a Disney story. The only Disney blemish shown is a quick shot of him stubbing a cigarette in an ashtray. Mr. Disney was an expert at hiding his smoking habit from the public ... well at least until he died from lung cancer in 1966, a mere two years after the premiere of Mary Poppins. Mostly Walt is depicted as working diligently to provide the trust and security that Travers sought in protecting her most precious flying nanny.The real star here is Emma Thompson's portrayal of Travers. Her desperate need for money is mentioned once, but the story is more concerned with her innate need to protect the legacy of her story ... no animation, no mean Mr Banks, no Dick Van Dyke, and no silly songs. Watching her interact with the songwriting Sherman brothers (Jason Schwartzman, BJ Novak) and the Disney screenwriter played by Bradley Whitford is the most fun this movie has to offer. Her 'no, no, no' mindset is quite frustrating for the quite successful Disney creative team. The armchair psychology is really where the movie falters a bit. Watching Walt struggle to mesmerize Travers with his Disney magic feels a bit forced, and when combined with numerous flashbacks to her childhood leave the audience way ahead of figuring out the key to her heart and mind.Once the daddy issues come to light, we get Hanks' best scene in the film. As he finally connects with Travers by laying bare his childhood (and fatherly) challenges, he eloquently explains the importance of imagination and storytelling for both children and adults. A desire to re-write or re-imagine our childhood seems to be at the core of many adults. It seems many dwell on the negative aspects of childhood, and even here, Travers' dad (Colin Farrell) may be the nicest alcoholic who ever inspired their kid to be a writer.PL Travers (born Helen Lyndon Goff) wrote 8 Mary Poppins books between 1934 and 1988, but was so unhappy with the film version that she never agreed to a sequel and it wasn't until the 1990's when she agreed to a stage version (no Americans allowed!). She passed away in 1996 at the age of 96, and the actual recordings played over the closing credits show just how well Ms. Thompson captured the strong will of the author.",7,1,2,22 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," wacky with feeling
","Greetings again from the darkness. Welcome to the most divisive movie of the year. Some will scoff at the idea and deride the filmmaker without ever even seeing the movie. Some will relay disgust after seeing the movie. A few won't appreciate the style or structure, and will fail to find the humor. Ah yes, but some of us will embrace Taika Waititi's wacky adaptation of Christine Leunens' 2018 novel 'Caging Skies' as one of the funniest and most heart-warming films of the year ... fully acknowledging that many won't see it our way.One wouldn't be off base in asking why a successful filmmaker would tackle such a risky project: a coming-of-age comedy-drama-fantasy about a 10 year old Nazi fanatic who has as his imaginary friend, not a 6 foot rabbit, but the Fuhrer himself, Adolph Hitler. After all, writer-director Waititi is coming off a couple of brilliant indies (2014's WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and 2016's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE) and a major score with Marvel money on THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), arguably the most entertaining superhero movie of the past few years. He certainly could have continued to cash in with 'safer' choices; however, Mr. Waititi sees the world differently than most of us. He finds humor in the drudgery, and humanity in malevolence. He's also a bit goofy.Playing over the opening credits is the German version of 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', as we see old clips of German citizens cheering for Adolph Hitler in a similar manner to how fans used to scream for The Beatles. World War II is nearing the end as we meet 10 year old Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo is fervent in his fanaticism towards the Nazi way, and buys into the belief that Jews are monsters with horns on their head. He's such a believer that his imaginary friend is actually Hitler, well at least a bumbling boisterous version played by the filmmaker himself - enacted to extreme comedy effect (recalling a bit of Chaplin in THE GREAT DICTATOR). Mel Brooks managed to play Hitler to a laughable extreme in 'Springtime for Hitler' in THE PRODUCERS, but the only thing missing her from Waititi's costume is an old timey dunce cap.Jojo lives at home with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while dad is off fighting on the front line. Ms. Johansson's performance is terrific (despite limited screen time) as she creates a believably warm bond with her son during horrific times. Soon, Jojo is off to a Nazi camp designed to teach the boys how to fight (and burn books), as the girls learn the virtues of having babies. The camp leaders are Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who is a bit of a joke on the surface, but more interesting the deeper we dig; Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who boasts of having 18 Aryan babies; and Finkel (Alfie Allen) a violent psychopath. At camp with Jojo is his best friend Yorki (newcomer and scene-stealer Archie Yates), and the two show what a genuine friendship can be as the movie progresses.Things change quickly for Jojo when, by happenstance, he discovers a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home. Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, LEAVE NO TRACE) shows none of the characteristics that Jojo has been brainwashed into believing all Jews possess. She has no horns, flashes a good sense of humor, and is actually very nice and knowledgeable. In other words, she's no monster. As they get to know each other, Jojo realizes this 'nice' Jewish girl contrasts starkly with his lunatic hero Adolph.Waititi's film is ingenious satire, and it likely won't sit well with those who think not enough time has passed to justify making fun of Nazi atrocities. It's funny and heavy, and deals with some thought-provoking matter in an unusual way. The 'Heil Hitler' count approaches the 'F-word' frequency of most Tarantino movies, and there is a German Shepherd gag that caught the audience off-guard. Stephen Merchant's Gestapo search of Jojo's house is comedy at its weirdest. The movie messes with your head as it's some odd blend of SCHINDLER'S LIST, 'The Diary of Anne Frank', and an extended Monty Python skit.It's rare for a film that borders on slapstick at times to have so many touching and emotional moments. The actors are really strong here, especially Ms. Johansson and Ms. McKenzie, who as gutsy Elsa, proves again she is quickly becoming a powerhouse young actor. Roman Griffin Davis carries a significant weight in the story despite being a first time actor, and I can't emphasize enough how young Archie Yates will steal your heart while he's stealing his scenes. Michael Giacchino's score and Mihai Malaimaire Jr's terrific cinematography work well with Waititi's vision ... a satirical vision that would never work outside of his unique filmmaking talent. The story is basically proof of the adage, 'Kill 'em with kindness', when what we are really killing is hatred. At its core, this is a story of humanity and human nature, and how we grab hold of the wrong thing until the truth becomes evident. Now, please pass the unicorn.",8,261,341,1 November 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Cluster Cuss of Wild Animals
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes being creative and clever just isn't enough. Writer/director Wes Anderson has a track record of extremely creative projects. Some work very well (Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore) while others fall just short of the mark (Life Aquatic, Darjeeling Limited). When Mr. Anderson hooks up with writer Noah Baumbach (Squid and the Whale) to take on a Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) story, a movie lover can't help but get very excited! The look of the film is very unusual and 'fantastic' in its own right. The fur or coats of the animals is pretty amazing and even the expressive faces are new to the big screen. What really fell short for me was the voice acting of some very impressive folks. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray all fall a bit flat and just play it too cool ... dare I say it ... they were all a bit boring! Willem Dafoe as the rat was really the only one who brought any life to his role.So while I absolutely love the look of the film and the characters, I was quite disappointed in the pace and passion of the story and the manner in which it's acted. It is probably too slow for both kids and adults, so I am not sure who the audience will be ... other than film technicians who will appreciate the look.",6,1,5,29 November 2009
Son of Saul," Up close
","Greetings again from the darkness. Not wanting to watch another movie related to the Holocaust is understandable. Why should you purposefully agree to experience the misery and unfathomable horror that occurred? The simple answer is that we should never forget one of the darkest and inexcusable periods in human history. Director Laszlo Nemes delivers a new approach  a different viewpoint  and it grabs us and doesn't let go.The startling opening is a long-tracking shot featuring Saul Auslander (played by Geza Rohrig) and his duties as part of the Sonderkommando unit at 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. The red X on his jacket relegates Saul to corralling the next round of Jews into the gas chamber and then cleaning up for the next group. The reward of this position means the delay of his own inevitable death. It's a closer, more intimate look at a process that we have not prevented ourselves to think much on.What we soon realize is that dialogue is minimal and most of what we see is as if we were standing right beside or just behind Saul. The shallow focus means much in our sight line is blurred, and we are exceptionally dependent on the sound – what we hear often conveys more of the message than what we see. Cinematographer Matyas Erdely never allows our eyes to drift  he shows us only so much, forcing our brain to process and interpret so many more clues.The horrific proceedings may be blurred, but it's a devastating experience nonetheless. Saul's stoic face masks his true emotions and disgust, and prevents him from drawing any unwanted attention. Saul's dependability as a Sonderkommando changes in the blink of an eye – he sees the body of a young boy whom he claims is his own son. He becomes obsessed with finding a Rabbi to allow for a proper burial for the boy. It seems clear that this mission is a chance to break from his soul-crushing duties and grab a bit of redemption before it's too late. Unfortunately, the timing of this mission conflicts with a planned prisoner uprising  adding more complexity to a nearly impossible quest.This is the feature film debut of director Laszlo Nemes, who also co-wrote the story with Clara Royer. Some of the specifics are drawn from 'Voices from Beneath the Ashes' (edited by Ber Mark) and 'Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account' by Miklos Nyiszli. It's a fearless vision for Holocaust storytelling with many open-ended issues (we don't always know identities and positions of those we see) and few conclusions provided. But then we all know the ultimate conclusion, and this look may be the most devastatingly intimate look we have ever had.It's not a movie that allows you to kick back on the sofa and simultaneously catch up with Facebook. It demands and deserves attention and patience. Nothing here is designed to allow us a 'hands off' view from a safe distance. In fact, the lack of traditional story structure and dialogue direction forces us to face the ugliest reality through a different perspective than we've ever considered. Powerful stuff.",8,1,5,21 January 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," A Hamster, A Fire Sale and Fogerty
","Greetings again from the darkness. Bruce Willis reprises his role as NYPD's supercop, John McClane, in by far, the best of the series since the original. Director Len Wiseman brings a fresh look and young eyes to the franchise and wisely and cleverly incorporates a story line that appeals to the Gen Y audience.Rising star Timothy Olyphant ('Deadwood') makes a wonderful virtual bad guy who was disrespected by the federal government when he dramatically demonstrated how insecure the U.S. systems were. Cast aside like Lex Luthor, he attempts to gain his revenge by shutting down society and bilking billions from Americans. Olyphant is aided in a most beautiful way by the lovely Maggie Q (MI:III) who gives Willis a run for his money and is the subject of some of the film's funniest lines.Ultra-hacker Justin Long gets dragged through the mess by Willis because he is a target of the bad guys and because he is smart enough to stop the bad guys ... oh, and also because Wiseman wanted some appealing youth to accompany Willis on this mission. Along the way, Long and Willis encounter uber-hacker Kevin Smith in a terrific segment that almost allows the viewer to catch his or her breath.Last, but certainly not least, Mary Elizabeth Winstead appears as Willis's daughter and the casting couldn't be better. Ms. Winstead was last seen in Tarantino's segment of 'Grindhouse' and is obviously ready for meatier roles. Look out for this girl.The 'Die Hard' series has always been about action and heart with a dose of comedy. Director Wiseman takes the special effects to a whole new level and the scenes with Willis and Long are really good. As for the comedy, it is probably the funniest in the series. Check this one out for a truly good time at the movies!",7,0,1,30 June 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Loki Rules
","Greetings again from the darkness. While this is the second Thor movie, we feel a bit more familiar with the Norse God thanks to The Avengers. It's not surprising that Chris Hemsworth can hold his own with the character given his looks and physicality, but this time he gets a run for his money thanks to Tom Hiddleston as Loki.The film's real villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who rules the Dark Elves and is trying to re-capture the all-powerful Aether, a substance of infinite energy. But the whole battle for the 9 realms is really just a sideline to Thor vs Loki, and Thor's touch of humanity and eye for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Most of the key characters are back: Anthony Hopkins as Odin (even more over the top this time), Rene Russo (Thor's mom), Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander (Sif), Idris Elba (Heimdall), Kat Dennings (Darcy), and Stellan Skarsgard (Erik Selvig).This sequel is kind of interesting to analyze. It's certainly bigger than the original ... the special effects are huge and much improved. Light comic moments abound, but luckily the snark from Kat Dennings is minimal. Chris O'Dowd shows up for a couple of pretty funny, but slightly out of place scenes. There are a couple of cameos including an off-beat appearance by one of the The Avengers. Rene Russo even gets her own sword fight! Though it matters not to me, I assume there are many who would choose a Skarsgard other than Stellan to run around Stonehenge sans clothes. So while it has all of that going for it, the story is certainly fails at engaging the audience.This one is directed by Alan Taylor, who is quite a successful TV director, and there was clearly some upfront concern over the script as Joss Whedon was brought in for scene doctoring. I believe what we learn is that the fish out of water story works when Thor is on Earth, but it loses impact when Jane Foster visits Asgard. Still, Tom Hiddleston is such fun to watch as Loki, that none of that really matters.It's a superhero movie that will entertain the fans and provide plenty of ammunition for the critics looking to bash. If you see it in the theatre, you should know to stay for BOTH post-movie scenes. A rare Benecio Del Toro sighting makes it worthwhile.",6,0,4,12 November 2013
Lucy," Mind Over Matter
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Luc Besson has a track record of mixing stylistic visuals with more traditional action: La Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element. This time he tries to mix those components with fantasy, sci-fi and neuroscience. His hope was that Scarlett Johannson in a snug t-shirt and Morgan Freeman as an on screen narrator would sufficiently distract viewers from the intercontinental drug-muling mess.We have all fantasized about expanded brain power, and many films have touched on this: Transcendence (Johnny Depp), The Matrix franchise, and Limitless (Bradley Cooper) to name a few. Omnipotence may not be everyone's goal, but it sure doesn't seem to go well in movies. This time around, there is a Korean drug syndicate led by Choi Min-sik (Oldboy) who have synthesized a drug that takes the human brain to a new level.There are some nice moments in the film, but the pieces just don't fit smoothly together. Circumstances are such that Scarlett finds herself experiencing the effects of the drug - first by dancing on the ceiling ala Lionel Ritchie, and then with the most awkward phone call to mom in film history. Soon enough her telekinetic powers are so advanced, she mows down the heavily armed bad guys with a flick of the finger. If that makes no sense to you, you'll have to follow along with Professor Morgan Freeman's charts and graphs. His lecture spells out the steps that Scarlett will go through and the interconnected scene cuts makes sure all movie goers can keep up ... even those who don't use 10% of their brain.My biggest complaint is that if a movie about extraordinary intelligence is to be made, then the movie itself should at least be smart ... or witty. What the movie tells us is that expanded brain access allows us to medically diagnose our friends through a hug, instantly change hair color while strolling through the airport, and create invisible force fields to trap our enemies. We also learn that really smart people drive the wrong way on one-way streets. In Dallas, we typically refer to those people as idiots ... or at least horrible drivers. Evidently the joke is on us - those are the enlightened ones!This movie should have been a lot more fun than it was. A tip of the cap to Mr. Besson for casting Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen), and for the global trek from Taipei to Berlin to Paris to NYC ... and finally a dinosaur and memory stick. While Scarlett's character remembers the taste of her mother's milk, I expect the memory of this film will fade quickly.",5,9,23,27 July 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Island Girl
","Greetings again from the darkness. Not many people think like Wes Anderson. That's probably a good thing in real life. It's definitely a good thing for movies. He is a creative and distinct filmmaker, though not one with mass appeal. My two personal favorites of his are The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore. His previous film, Fantastic Mr Fox, was a solid hit and critically lauded. Now he delivers one that will probably only click with his core fans. It's a thing of beauty ... if you keep in mind that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Set on the fictional New Penzance Island off the coast of New England in 1965, the movie opens with terrific visuals of the Bishop family's lighthouse/home. Our tour is conducted as if the home were a dollhouse, and our eyes struggle to keep up with the detailed decor. We are struck by the color palette of tans, greens and splashes of red. This will continue throughout the movie.The story centers around two 12 year old misfits: Sam and Suzy. Sam is an orphan and outcast in his Khaki Scouts troop, and Suzy is misunderstood and ignored by her selfish parents, who communicate with a bullhorn and through legalese at bedtime (they are both lawyers). Sam and Suzy are attracted to each other's misery and decide to run away together. This ignites a flurry of activity on this quiet island and showcases two first time actors with remarkable screen presence: Jared Gilman (Sam) and Kara Hayward (Suzy).The 'grown-ups' on the island include Suzy's parents played by Bill Murray (a Wes Anderson staple) and Frances McDormand. The island police chief is played Bruce Willis, who we soon figure out is also a social outcast. The Scoutmaster is played by Edward Norton in a regimented weirdness that will have you laughing in confoundment. For such serious topics, Mr. Anderson and co-writer Roman Coppola provide us many comedic moments - both through dialogue and site gags.During the search, other colorful supporting characters get involved. Social Services is after Sam. Tilda Swinton plays Social Services. In one of the few gags, I'll give away, Swinton's character only introduces herself as Social Services. This is a gut punch to a system that is often under-staffed and forgetful of it's true mission. We also get Jason Schwartzman as a very helpful, though slightly seedy, Cousin Ben. Harvey Keitel plays the senior Scoutmaster who is unhappy with Norton for losing a scout. Bob Balaban makes periodic appearances as a narrator ... either for a documentary or for the movie, depending on the moment's need.The script does a wonderful job of capturing how the 12 year old brain works. Some of the scenes with Sam and Suzy are almost like looking a photo album ... exactly the way our childhood memory works. Flashes of moments. The Alexandre Desplat score is heavy on percussion, but it works well with the minimalistic look of the film. It's also interesting to note that this is one of the few movies where it makes sense to have a soundtrack with Benjamin Britten, Hank Williams and Mozart! If you go to this one, keep your eyes open and moving, and your ears receptive. The payoff is worth it.",8,6,11,5 June 2012
Midway," dive bombers
","Greetings again from the darkness. Japan's World War II goal was to devastate the United States Navy fleet in the South Pacific, thereby securing the area as their own and crippling the U.S. military beyond hope. The December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor was the first step and the most infamous. Over the next few months, what followed were the Raid on Tokyo (April 1942), Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942) and the Battle of Midway (June 1942). Stating that these battles changed the war is not an understatement, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had previously been viewed as superior (especially after the destruction at Pearl Harbor). Director Roland Emmerich (THE PATRIOT, INDEPENDENCE DAY) has never met a war or explosion or special effect he didn't like, so we know going in that, given the subject matter and the filmmaker, the screen will be filled with action.Emmerich co-wrote the script with Wes Tooke (his first feature script), and as with many WWII movies, it acts as a history lesson on a war that changed the world. This one focuses on naval strategy and particularly on the individuals who defined courage and heroism ... many names we recognize from history books. The contrast between Japanese military leaders and United States military leaders is on full display, and it's no surprise that the Japanese leaders are mostly portrayed as cold and calculating, while the U.S. leaders come across as more humanistic and resourceful. Pride is evident on both sides - it's just displayed differently.The players are crucial to the story. Woody Harrelson plays Admiral Chester Nimitz, Dennis Quaid is Vice Admiral 'Bull' Halsey (commander of aircraft carrier USS Enterprise), Patrick Wilson is Intelligence Officer Lieutenant Commander Edwin Layton, Jake Weber is Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance, Luke Evans is Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky, Brennan Brown plays Joseph Rochefort (leader of the code breaker team), and Aaron Eckhart is Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, the extraordinary pilot who led the Raid on Tokyo in April 1942. On the Japanese side, Tadanabu Asano plays Rear Admiral Yamaguchi (commander of the aircraft carrier Hiryu), Jun Kunimura is Admiral Nagumo (he of questionable battle decisions), and Enushi Toyokawa plays Admiral Yamamoto, the most dignified and influential of the Japanese leaders.Much of the story is told from the perspective of naval pilot Lieutenant Dick Best (Ed Skrein, DEADPOOL). While personal stories and challenges faced by individuals makes for a relatable story for viewers, there is something about this particular actor that comes across as awkward and difficult to bond with. There is no doubting the character and courage of Dick Best as a pilot; however, Skrein's performance is flat out annoying and distracting. The dive bombing missions are breathtaking and thrilling, but overall the liberal use of green screen for effects detracts from the realistic looks we've come to expect for war movies.Mandy Moore as Anne Best, and Nick Jonas as a mechanic, are cast for relatability by viewers, but the value in the film comes from an easy-to-follow description of the contrasting strategies of the two militaries. It's also a reminder that the 'big' story of WWII is comprised of many individual stories of people ... people who were brave and heroic in a time of need. So ignore the cheesy affects, unrealistic dialogue, and irritating performances, and instead take in the work and actions of those who saved the world.",5,23,57,8 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nostalgic and New Fun
","Greetings again from the darkness. In what can justifiably be termed a cultural event, director J.J. Abrams brings us Episode VII in a film franchise that date backs almost 40 years. While I was one of the lucky ones who waited patiently in line to see the first Star Wars on opening day in 1977, I can only be described as a series fan rather than a Star Wars geek. My bond is with Hans Solo and Chewbaca, so this is not the place to debate the minutiae of costumes, timelines and weaponry.What I can happily report is that Mr. Abrams (he's also directed Star Trek and Mission Impossible films) has found just the right blend of nostalgia, science-fiction, and geeky gadgetry to appeal to the widest of all audiences. The film is an honorable tribute to the previous six in the series, yet it's more than entertaining enough to stand alone for new comers.As we expect and hope for, the screen is filled with fantastical visuals that somehow push our imagination, while at the same time, feel realistic to the story and action. The aerial dogfights are adrenaline-pumping and spectacular in their vividness, and the more grounded action scenes feature Stormtroopers who have clearly had lots of target practice since the previous films.You need only watch the trailer or read the credits to know that some of the old familiar faces are back: Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, Peter Mayhew as Chewbaca, and of course, our old pals C-3P0 and R2D2. Also back is the remarkable composer John Williams – likely to receive his fiftieth (yes, 50!) Oscar nomination for his work here. In addition to the familiar, new faces abound: John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kyle (don't call me Ben) Ren, Oscar Isaac as Poe, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, and Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Hux. There is also the magic of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, and an all-too-brief sequence featuring Max von Sydow. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o voices Maz Kanata, and there is an impressive list of other cameos available online if you are interested (Daniel Craig being the most eye-raising).Abrams along with action cinematographer extraordinaire Daniel Mindel take full advantage of all available technical aspects in creating stunning visuals and spine-tingling sound. It's a film made to be watched on the biggest screen with the best sound system, so ask around if you aren't sure. If you are a long-time fan of Han and Chewy, you'll enjoy catching up with old friends. If you are unfamiliar with the Star Wars galaxy, this latest will hook you into the force.",8,12,41,23 December 2015
Flight," Banana Boat is here
","Greetings again from the darkness. What is a hero? There have certainly been no shortage of super hero movies these past few years, but those are mostly comic book characters brought to life through the magic of Hollywood. Can a heroic act turn a flawed man into a hero? Should his flaws change how we treat him after the heroic act? All these are questions raised by the script from John Gatins. The easiest question of all? If you are a movie producer and you need a flawed hero ... the obvious choice is Denzel Washington.Director Robert Zemekis returns to live action after more than a decade of experimenting with animation. Of course, Zemekis is firmly entrenched in Hollywood lore thanks to his Back to the Future trilogy, as well as Forrest Gump (for which he won an Oscar). This is quite dark material for Zemekis and he handles it quite well. The trailer tells us what we need to know about the premise. Denzel plays a pilot who, under extreme circumstances, 'inverts' the commercial jet he is flying so it can be landed in an open field. Yes, invert means to fly the plane upside down. If you are queasy about flying, this is one to avoid. And don't count on this being the in-flight movie on your next business trip.The first 30 minutes of this movie are as strong as any seen on screen this year. We quickly get a sense of Captain Whip Whitaker and then we see his remarkable actions during an incredibly well filmed crash sequence. Unfortunately, I found the second half of the film plays like a heavy-handed advertisement for AA (not American Airlines). Whitaker is exposed for his absurdly high blood alcohol level and existence of cocaine ... so clearly presented in the film's opening. Over the years, many films have tackled addiction: Leaving Las Vegas, Clean and Sober, When a Man Loves a Woman. Rarely have we seen the expert talent of deception and lying that Capt Whitaker displays.There is little doubt that Denzel's performance will warrant Oscar consideration ... and it should. The film depends on an actor skilled enough to reach the depths necessary for us to believe this guy, despite his cocky pilot strut and unmatched flying skills, is little more than a mentally weak addict.There are a couple of outstanding supporting performances here: John Goodman as Harling Mays, a colorful and energetic, free-wheeling dealer who works miracles with Whitaker when he appears to gone to function; and Kelly Reilly (Mary Watson from the Sherlock Holmes movies) as fellow addict Nicole, who connects with Whip and tries to help him. We also get solid work from Don Cheedle, Brian Geraghty, Tamara Tunie, Peter Geraty and Melissa Leo. There is also an odd scene featuring James Badge Dale as a cancer patient/philosopher.The Alan Silvestri score is effective, as is the soundtrack featuring the somewhat obvious songs from Joe Cocker, The Rolling Stones and Cowboy Junkies. The issues with the script are minor and it is recommended in spite of the Bruce Greenwood factor. Every frequent movie goer has their acting nemesis and Greenwood's presence usually indicates a disappointing movie for me ... not the case here.",7,5,9,4 November 2012
Unbroken," Cane and Able
","Greetings again from the darkness. Louis Zamperini was a true American hero and his life story is epic and legendary. The son of Italian immigrants, young Louie easily found trouble, and only the efforts of his older brother and a local police officer allowed him to discover inner strength through his talent for distance running. As a 19 year old, Louie ran in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and later enlisted in the Air Force and served as a bombardier during WWII. After a horrible plane crash, he spent a grueling 47 days adrift at sea in a life raft, until rescued/captured by the Japanese. Zamperini served as a Prisoner of War, where he was subjected to immense physical and psychological torture, until the war finally ended.Zamperini's story has long deserved to be made into a movie, and it has bounced around Hollywood since 1957. However, it wasn't until Laura Hillenbrand's biography on Zamperini became a best seller in 2010 that the film version was given the go-ahead. With screenplay credits for Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson, cinematography from the great Roger Deakins, and a score from Alexandre Desplat, it was a bit surprising when Angelina Jolie was named director. After all, she only had one previous credit as a director, and that film (In the Land of Blood and Honey, 2011) was nowhere near the scope of this project.Given the true life inspirational story and the truly heroic events of its featured character, the film can best be labeled a mild disappointment. It is extremely impressive to look at, but somehow lacking in emotion  despite some excruciatingly uncomfortable moments. The film strives for the level of historic epic, yet its conventional tone and approach leave us wondering what's missing. The single most effective and emotional moment occurs in a short clip of the real Louis Zamperini running as an Olympic torch bearer at age 80 for the 1998 Olympics (in Japan!).Jack O'Connell pours everything he has into capturing the spirit of Zamperini, and he is certainly an actor to keep an eye on. Japanese rock star Miyaki plays 'The Bird' Watanabe, a sadistic POW camp commander who brutalized Zamperini, but Miyaki lacks the chops to pull off this crucial role – going a bit heavy on the posturing. The film uses the line 'If you can take it, you can make it' as its rallying cry, but too many gaps are left for the audience to bridge as we watch Louie go from a punk kid to a war hero with almost mystical courage and perseverance. Other supporting work comes from Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund, Jai Courtney and CJ Valleroy (as young Louie).On paper, all the pieces are in place for an Oscar contender, and the film may very well play well with voters. My preference would have been to have the real life Louis Zamperini more involved  through either narration or interviews. He spent the second half of his life as a motivational speaker and story-teller, and would have added an incredible element to the film. Unfortunately, Mr. Zamperini died 4 months prior to the release of the film so he never saw the finished product. It's likely he died knowing that his legacy is part of American history and that he did in fact 'make it'.",6,5,14,27 December 2014
Munich," The Mice in Your Head
","Greetings again from the darkness. We never really know which Steven Spielberg is going to show up. Will it be the incredible storyteller of 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan'? Or will it be the fun loving, mushy, sometimes too-cute-for-his-own-good director off 'AI' and 'Catch Me if You Can'? No question, the famed storyteller and master technician brought is A game for 'Munich'.We get the sickening story after the tragic story of in the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. SS crafts a dramatic reenactment amidst the the real-life newsreels featuring sportscaster Jim McKay and Howard Cosell thrust into unfamiliar territory. For those of us old enough to remember, this became a moment like Kennedy's assassination and the walk on the moon ... we recall where we were at when McKay informs 'They're all gone'.What Spielberg has done is concentrate on the aftermath. The story of the original terrorists is almost secondary. Watching actress Lynn Cohen reincarnate Prime Minister Golda Meir is very creepy. She really captures the spirit and power of the woman. As the Israeli government organizes an assassination team to take care of the terrorists involved, we realize the goal of revenge is pretty hopeless and that bloodshed could go on forever with these tactics.The leader of the team is Avner, played excruciatingly well by Eric Bana. Bana has come along way from 'Hulk'! We feel his pain and moral conflict throughout. This process leads him to the brink of losing touch with reality. What a sad result of a bad idea. Although, Bana is the main actor, it is interesting to note that Daniel Craig offers up another performance making it all but impossible to imagine him as a wise-cracking international spy known as Bond.Is there any hope that these two lands can reconcile and live peaceably? Spielberg does not really answer. The real sadness is that this clash of ethnic, cultural and religious differences offer no real hope for change in the present or future. This is stunning visual storytelling and remarkable film-making that will touch you and frustrate you.",8,18,37,25 December 2005
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Remember who the Real Enemy is
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's quite clear I am not the target audience for Suzanne Collins' literary trilogy or the corresponding movies that are packing in the teenagers and young adults. Still, I'll admit to enjoying the first movie ... and being even a bit more impressed by this second entry. Having a female heroine that is young, strong, smart, loyal, and emotionally grounded is not just unusual, but also quite a welcome change of pace.Any uproar over missing/adapted elements from the source books can be chalked up to the young readers who haven't yet come to understand that a 2 hour movie cannot possibly relay all the details and imagination held within the written page. In fact, co-screenwriters Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael deBrauyn (aka Michael Arndt of Toy Story 3 fame) do an excellent job of balancing the numerous elements contained within the story: a fascist government, the off-kilter romances, family bonds, and the early stages of a revolution/uprising. This sequel features a new and much better suited director in Francis Lawrence, known for I Am Legend.What really makes this material click on screen is the performance of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Her Mockingjay becomes the symbol of hope for the many districts intimidated by the iron fist rule of the President, played by the menacing Donald Sutherland. Ms. Lawrence is an absurdly talented actress and is one of the rare few who can convey a multitude of emotions through facial expressions alone. Despite her prickly personality, the audience connects with her in a most positive manner.In addition to Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Sutherland, returning to the fold are Josh Hutcherson as Peeta (still lacking even an ounce of screen presence), Woody Harrelson as Haymitch (giving a bit more effort this time around), Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Paula Malcomson as Katniss' mother (seen recently as Abby in 'Ray Donovan'), Willow Shields as Prim, Liam Hemsworth as Gale (his most exciting scene is washing his hands), and of course the instant electricity and energy provided by Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Stanley Tucci as Caesar - two of the most colorful characters this side of 1970's era Elton John.New to this chapter are two of the finest actors working today: Philip Seymour Hoffman as game designer Plutarch Heavensbee, and Jeffrey Wright as 'Volts' from the 'nuts and volts' duo with Amanda Plummer. Jena Malone tries, but is miscast as Johanna, and Sam Claflin has a couple of worthy moments as Finnick. Two of the best additions are the frightening killer baboons and the Black Swan-style wedding dress. Both make eye-opening entries.There is much to like about this series thus far, but of course, one must accept it for the genre it represents. And fair warning - see the two Hunger Games movies in order ... or don't bother. Regardless of your take on this franchise - may the odds be ever in your favor.",7,1,17,24 November 2013
Godzilla," Our Hero?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sixty years after Godzilla made his initial screen appearance, we get a full blown Hollywood special effects blockbuster version that will eclipse the $100 million mark in its first weekend. This is director Gareth Edwards second feature film (Monsters, 2010) and he juggles the modern day re-imagining with the Japanese roots and a hand full of other tributes throughout.The cast seems impressive: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn. Unfortunately, most of these fine actors have little to do, and instead the dominant human presence (most every scene) is Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) who somehow keeps getting gigs despite lacking even a dollop of screen presence or acting ability. Of course, this movie is supposed to belong to Godzilla, and even he is usurped on screen time by two nuclear-feasting praying mantis creatures that share some attributes with the classic Alien. These screen hogs are called MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) and are quite substantial ... crushing skyscrapers by landing.The 1954 original film was an anti-nuclear statement, though the re-edited U.S. version replaced the political statement with Raymond Burr. Mr. Burr also appeared in the 1984 sequel which included a storyline of feeding off a nuclear plant (borrowed in this year's version). This film's prologue featuring Bryan Cranston working at a 1999 nuclear plant is an unmistakable nod to the recent Fukushima disaster, and sets the stage for the collision of science (Watanabe) and military (Strathairn). Director Edwards clearly enjoys his Jaws-like teasing of Godzilla, who finally shows up after almost an hour. And despite the Jurassic Park roar by our titular monster, this doesn't hold a candle to Spielberg's 1993 classic. We do get the quite familiar shots of bystanders running down the street, glancing back in fear - a must for any monster movie.Having seen this one in 3D, I'll mention again that the enhanced effects offered by this technology do not offset the darkened, dulled look. Add that to the almost total lack of color - it's borderline Black and White - and there are simply too few breathtaking visual moments to consider this a monster classic.",6,1,2,18 May 2014
Looper," The Bad Path is a Circle
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Rian Johnson (Brick) delivers a very entertaining, thrilling and clever sci-fi film that features time travel, dark comedy, romance, metaphysics, and enough action to keep just about any viewer engaged ... as long as you enjoy using your brain a bit.Source Code, the recent film from Duncan Jones, used time travel in very limited segments. Here time travel is 30 years into the future and has been declared illegal. So, of course, only crime syndicates use it. When you think about it, sending your enemies back in time to be killed and disposed of is brilliant. It's very difficult to solve these type of crimes ... though, there is no evidence anyone is trying. The future mob boss known as The Rainmaker hires 'loopers' from 30 years past to handle the dirty work. When The Rainmaker begins 'closing loops', he does so by sending the loopers back in time to be killed by their younger selves. Yes, somehow this works.Well it works until Seth (Paul Dano) chokes up and lets his future self escape. That doesn't go over well with the modern day crime boss (Jeff Daniels) who just can't allow these future guys to be roaming free. Then, just like that, the same thing happens to Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt). His future self (Bruce Willis) appears, he flubs the kill, and the next thing you know, the Joe and Old Joe are seated in a booth at a remote diner ordering the same breakfast and staring into their own eyes.Plenty of fun stuff in this one, although, I had a tough time buying a blond Emily Blunt as a Kansas farmer. Her young son Cid, played by Pierce Gagnon, is one of the more interesting characters in the film. He is supposed to the young version of the future Rainmaker, and he possesses some unusual traits ... with Blunt trying to supply sufficient motherly love to prevent him from spinning off track.Director Johnson has a knack of tossing in some dark humor at just the right time. Some of the romance seemed a bit forced, but the criminal element and the Joe vs Old Joe stuff was really fascinating to keep up with. If you enjoy movies that are somewhat challenging, and you can suspend reality for the time travel elements, it's one that you'll probably find quite entertaining.

50_50," Tears, Laughs, Life Lessons
","Greetings again from the darkness. The great Richard Pryor had a portion of his act dedicated to having a heart attack, based on his real life experience. I guess if he can generate laughter from a coronary, there is no reason writer Will Reiser and director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) can't view Cancer as Comedy. There is little doubt that the subject matter of this film will limit its audience, but for those brave souls who give it a shot, I believe you will find it funny, touching and insightful.The film introduces us to Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a very nice, very normal, very low-key guy who works at a radio station as a writer ... a very conscientious radio writer. Adam experiences a nagging pain in his back, which is unusual for a healthy 27 year old. After a few tests, the emotionless doctor informs him that he has a rare spinal cancer ... also very unusual for a healthy 27 year old. From this point forward, the film borders on brilliance at times.Adam's girlfriend is played by Bryce Dallas Howard; his mother by Angelica Huston; and his best friend by Seth Rogen. Each reacts in different ways to Adam's diagnosis, but what's really interesting is not just how these people react, but also how Adam reacts. He moves forward in his meticulous manner, but all the while we know the emotions are brewing. We see this in his sessions with his therapist-in-training played by Anna Kendrick.Seth Rogen's character is basically a carbon copy of his act in 40 Year Old Virgin. He spews profane one-liners faster than our ears can process. Despite the aggressive front, Rogen's character is a friend with a heart ... and one who doesn't hesitate to share his medicinal marijuana.So while Rogen's character generates much of the laughter, the real treasure of this film is in the subtleties of each character in certain moments ... and each character has their moment. Many will compare this to Adam Sandler's film Funny People, which also starred Seth Rogen. But this movie has infinitely more depth and substance than that one offered.My warning: brace yourself. My theatre was filled with tears and sniffles, with significant laugh out loud moments mixed in. This is an emotional, self-reflective film that will confound you as you inexplicably laugh while listening to cancer talk.",7,146,180,2 August 2011
Deadpool," The real heroes here
","Greetings again from the darkness. Superhero movies have been dominating the box office for the better part of two decades, and most tend to lean towards moody and intense  though Iron-Man and The Avengers have certainly enjoyed adding searing one-liners to the mix. As for ratings, superheroes have steadfastly claimed PG-13 as the perfect blend of massive action, massive muscles and massive audiences. So it's a little surprising to find a movie about a relatively unknown superhero, that's the first feature from director Tim Miller (previously a visual effects guru), crashing through the R-rated barrier in no-holds-barred fashion. It's startling and refreshing to see a new take on what had become just a bit too familiar.This is a movie for which you will want to actually read the opening credits and stay for the post credit scene (a 2-parter). Additionally, you will want to make sure you keep not only little kids away (remember the hard R-rating), but also any grown-ups who are offended by harsh language (on the Tarantino scale), ultra-violence (on the Kill Bill scale) or any combination of sex, sex talk or sex jokes (all at an entirely new level). To label this movie as crass or profane is like calling Chewbacca somewhat fuzzy. And while it pushes the raunch-o-meter, it's also blazingly funny at times (especially for a cancer movie).The previously mentioned opening credits refer to the writers as 'the real heroes here', and while the plot is pretty textbook superhero stuff, it's the barrage of one-liners and sight gags at which those writers so excel. They even make sure those unfamiliar with the Wade Wilson backstory understand that he is a former special forces operative turned mercenary for the average Joe's and Jane's. In no time, it's drilled into our heads that he is also a wiseacre, wisenheimer, wise-ass, wisecracker and any other adjective that means funny but not wise.Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson/Deadpool and leaves no doubt that he has finally found the role that fits him as well as his red suit. If you are convulsing as you flashback to Mr. Reynolds as Green Lantern (2011), take solace in the fact that this movie fires a couple of deadly shots at that oh-so-disappointing effort. His girlfriend Vanessa is played by Morena Baccarin ('Homeland'), and his best buddy/bartender is played by TJ Miller ('Silicon Valley'). Since Reynolds had a brief appearance as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), there are numerous nods to that franchise, including two key roles here for Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The target of Deadpool's revenge comes in the form of Ed Skrein (The Transporter Refueled) as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust  accompanied by her theme song 'Angel of the Morning' (unfortunately it's the Juice Newton version, and not the more powerful Merrillee Rush and the Turnabouts version). Lastly, it's pure joy to see Leslie Uggams cast in a spunky supporting role.Your kid may have a Captain America figurine on their bookshelf, but the R-rating is solidified in the first 10 minutes, and is relentlessly reinforced until the movie ends. We can only imagine how much fun those old enough to watch are going to have, and brace yourself for an onslaught of Deadpool comebacks over the next few weeks  only hopefully not in church, at the office, in front of grandma, etc",7,2,13,12 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," Melody or Malady. The True True
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ambitious and mesmerizing. Those are the two words that best describe my reaction to this stunning film based on the David Mitchell novel. Hopefully, you have not come here for answers to the many mysteries offered up by this most unique film experience. If you are the type that loves to think, analyze and discuss complex movies, you will be challenged and satisfied. If you prefer your stories clean, straightforward and gift-wrapped, you will be like some of those in my audience who walked out of the theatre at various stages -not to return.While there are no easy explanations for what we see on screen, this is undoubtedly one of the more complex and multi-faceted and challenging movies to watch. There are six stories that span approximately 500 years (beginning in 1849 and going through 2346 or so). We see many actors playing multiple characters of various ages, crossing racial and gender lines depending on the specific story. We track the progression/regression of their souls through time. This will prove more challenging to you than it sounds on paper, as the make-up work is some of the most extreme ever seen on screen.The six stories are co-written and directed by Tom Twyker (Run Lola Run) and The Wachowski's (Lana and Andy, The Matrix trilogy). These six segments are split evenly between the two director groups, yet then blend seamlessly thanks to the truly expert editing of Alexander Berner. You will recognize the influence and similarities of such films as Master and Commander, Cocoon, Silkwood and Blade Runner, as well as many others.Filling the clothing, donning the make-up and spouting the dialogue in manners that you often won't recognize are such actors as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Donna Bae, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D'Arcy, Xun Zhou, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. Especially entertaining are Hugo Weaving as a sadistic female nurse and Hugh Grant as a violent tribesman. The best laughs in the film are courtesy of the great Mr. Broadbent whose facial expressions are near clown-like in elasticity.As for the themes and points of the film, that is a topic for debate. A couple of lines of dialogue offer some clues. Hanks' nasty ship doctor spouts 'The weak are meat the strong do eat', and we notice the recurring theme of the strong dominating the weak across all story lines. There is another line: 'One can transcend any convention so long as one can conceive of doing so', that provides the glimmer of hope in each story. Love and oppression are always present, but it's clear to me that the human spirit remains strong and is capable of overcoming oppression in the past, present and future. You may disagree but our debates will be colorful ... and may change after a second viewing!",8,9,22,26 October 2012
300," Fight in the Shade
","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on both historical fact and Frank Miller's graphic novel, '300' brings alive the legendary 300 Sparta soldiers.Gerard Butler is truly powerful as King Leonidas, the leader who takes the men off to battle despite the disapproval of council. The battle scenes are extraordinary and unlike anything we have seen on film before. The hand to hand combat is breathless at times and the creatures of Xerxes army are quite the colorful lot, as his Xerxes himself (played flamingly by Rodrigo Santoro).The weakness of the film comes from the lack of dramatic energy within the boundaries of Sparta. The citizens and council are faceless, save Dominic West as slimy Theron, and Lena Headey as the spunky Queen. No amount of spectacular action can save a lackluster story.",6,2,7,15 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fun with Spies
","Greetings again from the darkness. In 2010, writer/director Matthew Vaughn turned the superhero genre on its ear with the hit Kick-Ass. With this most recent film, he has done the same thing to spy-thrillers. We get the well-tailored look made famous by Roger Moore's James Bond, the fanciful and lethal gadgets from early Bond films, the ever-present umbrella (put to new uses here) of The Avenger's John Steed, and the ultra-suave and debonair manners of Napoleon Solo from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. We get all of that in a surprisingly effective and fun action performance from Colin Firth.Fun is the operative word here. It's clear all parties involved are having a great time, especially Mr Firth going drastically against type. There are two action-packed and pretty humorous (in a demented way) fight scenes. One is early on inside a London pub, and has Firth flashing his particular set of skills against a group of thugs. The other (and even more raucous) fight occurs inside a church and is set to Lynryd Skynyrd's 'Free Bird'. The body count piled up as fast as the guitar licks.As spectacular as the fight scenes are, the real fun here is in the characters. The old guard of the Kingsmen includes Firth as Galahad, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, and Michael Caine as Arthur. This long-standing group is one part international spy, one part Knights of the Round Table  and these gentlemen are extremely well trained and impeccably well dressed. When one of their agents dies on the job, the recruitment boot camp kicks into gear. Made up of a group of relative newcomers to the movie world, the two most interesting are Roxy (Sophie Cookson) and Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Adding to the intrigue, Eggsy is the son of a former Kingsmen, and has some skills that aren't initially apparent.Of course, what would a spy-tribute movie be without a colorful villain? Samuel L Jackson plays lispy megalomaniac Valentine, who has a quick gag reflex when it comes to violence. Fortunately his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is equipped with razor sharp leg prosthetics and some ultra-crazy fighting skills. We even see Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold  fans of the Mark Miller/Dave Gibbons graphic novel will appreciate the irony. Firth and Egerton play off each other quite well in the mentor-pupil relationship, and Egerton is clearly set up for the franchise sequels  as is his friend and fellow Kingsman, Ms. Cookson. For those who think the Daniel Craig Bond films are too dark and serious, this provides a flashback to lighter Bond fare (minus the misogyny). Many hot topics are touched on: class warfare, domestic abuse, racism, etc, but mostly this can be taken as a rollicking good time because 'it's not that kind of movie'. It does, however, remind us that 'manners make the man'.",7,2,7,16 February 2015
Easy A," The Inexactitude of High School
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is an obvious (and proud of it) homage to the great teen films of John Hughes. It is updated for this generation of teens - replete with FaceBook, texting and webcam. While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films, it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics: family life, parenting, religious zealotry, rumor-mongering and the public education system.Writer Bert V. Royal's script delivers an intellectual and comedic look into high school life ... told through the eyes of the smart, 'invisible' girl. Just a brief overview will be offered here so as not to take away from the multiple layers.Emma Stone ('Zombieland', 'The House Bunny') delivers a star-making performance as Olive. Forced into a faux-confession by her best friend, Olive experiences the efficiencies of digital gossip spreading as word leaks regarding the apparent loss of her 'V card'. Even though this one is based in Ojai, California, it's nice to know that high school promiscuity is still met with a certain stigma. Here that stigma is compared to Hawthorne's expert novel, The Scarlet Letter.This sets into action a series of unforeseen events. The school's religious nuts, led by Amanda Bynes, take Olive's situation as a personal affront and spend a great deal of effort trying to punish her for her sins. At the same time, the geeks and dweebs view Olive as their savior and proceed to take advantage of the opportunity.While she is presented as a very sharp-witted, well-grounded teenager, Olive experiences the enormous power of a reputation. All of this is balanced out by her extraordinary relationship with her free-spirited, yet wise parents played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci.I can't possibly do justice to the script or the numerous topics broached, but I will say that it's a welcome new approach to teen movies. The usual schlock sex is replaced by sharp quips and real pressures. Do note that the dialogue is filled with much harsh language that wouldn't be welcome in an environment other than a high school campus. Further support work is offered by Penn Badgley as the good guy, Thomas Haden Church as a new world cool teacher, Malcolm McDowell as an old school principal and Lisa Kudrow as a guidance counselor (in a role that gives me permission to feel the disgust I usually feel when she is on screen).Don't be scared off thinking this is another lousy teen flick. It is instead an insightful comedy that plays well for adults and teens. While you may not agree with all of the social observations, I believe you will agree the film is presented in a most entertaining and insightful manner.",7,55,83,18 September 2010
Green Book," Crowd pleaser with bite
","Greetings again from the darkness. The titular 'Green Book' (not the official book title) was a travel guide highlighting safe places for African Americans to stay, eat and visit from the 1930's through the mid 1960's. Yes, it was a real publication and yes, there was a real need for it during the Jim Crow era. The book makes for a nice movie title, but this sterling dramedy from director Peter Farrelly focuses more on the budding friendship of two men from vastly different worlds separated by a few city blocks.Mr. Farrelly is one-half of the infamous Farrelly Brothers who have directed such raunchy comedy hits as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (1998) and DUMB AND DUMBER (1994). This is quite the change of pace for him, as it is for co-stars Mahershala Ali (Oscar winner last year for MOONLIGHT) and heavy drama stalwart Viggo Mortensen. We see a crisp blend of the era's harsh racism and the inherent comedy of a buddy road trip featuring a working class NYC Italian-American and an upper crust, well-educated, world class African-American pianist.The film kicks off in 1962 at the Copacabana, a mob-controlled club where Frank Anthony 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga (a beefed up Mortensen) gives us an up-close look at his bouncer skills. He's quite good at his job. When the club closes for renovation, he takes a job as a chauffeur/bodyguard for Dr. Don Shirley (Ali), who is beginning an 8 week tour as the featured player in a jazz trio through the Midwest and Deep South. Tony Lip is a walking Italian clichÃ©, while Dr Shirley is a regal black man ... in fact, he might view himself as royalty - living alone in a swank apartment above Carnegie Hall. This is a good time to note that Tony Lip's son Nick Vallelonga co-wrote the script, is a producer on the film, and even makes an appearance as a State Trooper.Inspired by the true story of this trip and the lifelong friendship that ensued, we get to know both men as they get to know each other. Tony Lip is a streetwise man who is comfortable with his lot in life, while Dr. Shirley plays his role in society while quietly stewing internally. He flashes his toothy grin to disarm the adoring white audiences, but then sucks down his Cutty Sark in the evening, as he is good enough to perform for them, but not good enough to dine with them (or even use their restroom). There are times the racism gets violent and that's where Tony Lip comes in.Don helps Tony write romantic and intimate letters to his wife Dolores (played by Linda Cardellini), while Tony teaches Don about KFC and Little Richard ... proclaiming 'I'm blacker than you!' in one of the film's funniest moments. It's an awkward buddy film that in real life developed into a decades-long friendship - one that only ended when both died in 2013. It could be described as a twisted DRIVING MISS DAISY with a dose of THE HELP. It's certainly a crowd-pleaser, even delivering a mushy ending not dissimilar to that of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES. Of course we don't mind, because after spending a couple of hours with these two, we are fine with a feel-good ending. The film is showcase for two terrific actors, and for those that don't know, the real Tony Lip appeared in a few projects such as 'The Sopranos' and DONNIE BRASCO. Expect to see these two actors get some love at Oscar time, and this is one of the few that can be recommended to just about every movie lover.",8,4,11,16 November 2018
Fantastic Four," Flame Out
","Greetings again from the darkness. As a kid, I was a huge fan of the Saturday morning cartoon series and was very saddened when it was taken off the air due to parental concerns over violent images. Humorous when one compares to the video games that so pre-occupy the days of today's kids. The appeal of the Fantastic Four was always the isolation and camaraderie of this team. Most super heroes were isolated by their superpowers, but these four could depend on each other and were much stronger as a team than individually.Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were co-writers on Spider-man, Hulk and many others. My feelings were always that they had something special with this group. Director Tim Story is handicapped with a pretty weak cast, although Julian McMahon ('Charmed', 'Nip/Tuck') does a decent job as Victor Von Doom and Michael Chiklis ('The Shield' and a memorable 'Seinfeld') is very good as Ben Grimm/The Thing. On the other hand, Jessica Alba and Ion Gruffodd (TV's 'Hornblower' series) recite their lines as if threatened by electric shock if they blow one. Chris Evans seems to have fun with the most energetic role of Johnny Storm but there is just not enough for him to do.Special Effects in this one are pretty decent, but the movie watches as if we are reading a comic book. I realize we are, but most of the comic-to-film projects have at least made an effort to provide a script that flows and has passable dialogue between characters. Fantastic Four makes no such attempts. This is a cartoon in every sense and that really causes it to pale in comparison to especially Spider-man, but even Hulk.",5,37,72,9 July 2005
Click," Like Corn Flakes
","Greetings again from the darkness. First of all, this movie is not as funny as it thinks it is, nor is it as dramatic as it pretends to be. The previews lead us to believe that this is a typical Adam Sandler adolescent comedy, but in fact, it is more in the vein of 'Family Man' , 'Mr Destiny' and 'It's A Wonderful Life'. Of course, it is definitely not in the class of the latter, but it does share some common elements with all three.Director Frank Coraci (seen briefly as a male nurse) should thank Mr. Sandler daily since his money makers as a director have been 'The Wedding Singer' and 'The Waterboy'. Sandler doesn't seem to put much into his performance, but Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken at least seem to have a little fun. Then there is David Hasselhoff enjoying the spotlight again and Jennifer Coolidge is always a hoot.The most interesting sidebar on this film is the decision to cast some kids of stars. Lorraine Nicholson (Jack's daughter) plays Samantha as a 14 yr old. Katie Cassidy (David's daughter) plays Samantha as a young adult. And best of all, Jake Hoffman (Dustin's son) plays Ben as a young architect running the business. An unusual casting stunt that adds a touch of interest where there is very little.Christopher Walken will make you chuckle a couple of times and the heartstrings are pulled pretty hard on the whole issue of family vs. work, but for the most part, this movie struggles in both comedy and drama. Sandler fans will be disappointed in his performance, but the film should have a nice life on cable and DVD.",4,1,5,27 June 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Not your ordinary flesh wound
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I just attended the theatrical re-release with my 17 year old son, and must say I am glad I did. Originally released when I was in high school, today's teenage generation NEEDS to see this movie to discover that comedy does not necessarily involve the spewing of four letter words.  An amazing combination of sight gags and crackling dialogue, one can't resist many outbursts of laughter.  Yes, there is a little blood ... ridiculously staged by today's standards, but it is all in good fun.  Many levels on which to review the movie, but all I want to say is, drag your teenagers to this movie.  They will be better off having seen it.",9,0,0,11 September 2001
Incredibles 2," Jack Jack is a star
","Greetings again from the darkness. In 2004 THE INCREDIBLES became the 6th Pixar film in a row to dominate the box office, and also the 6th straight to 'WOW' us with a combination of animation, story, action and characters. All these years later, Brad Bird, the creative force behind the original, is back with the much anticipated sequel. Mr. Bird's career over those years has featured a blend of other animation (RATATOUILLE, 2007) and live-action (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL). Bird is not the only returnee for the sequel. Also back is the entire Parr Family: Holly Hunter as Elastigirl/Helen/Mom, Craig T Nelson as Mr. Incredible/Bob/Dad, Sarah Vowell as Violet, Huck Milner as Dash, and Eli Fucile as baby Jack Jack. The story picks up not long after the original ended. 'Supers' have been outlawed, and the Parrs are in some type of Super Protection Program - similar to Witness Protection. Of course when one is a superhero, doing the right thing just comes naturally, and the opening scene finds them battling their old nemesis Underminer (voiced by Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, who voices a character in each of the studio's films). Our heroes stop the crime, but cause significant damage to the city. This leads to our first social commentary when the powers that be scold the Parrs and inform them that the banks have insurance, and it's cheaper to let the criminals get away so that the damage is minimized. As superheroes non-grata, the Parrs try to go 'straight' and live a normal life. That is until a powerful brother and sister corporate duo offer a proposal. Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (twist that pronunciation just a bit, voiced by Catherine Keener) want to generate a PR plan to help rebuild the reputation of supers. The idea is to make Elastigirl the public face of the program by having her wear a body cam to show off her heroic deeds (in this age of 'pics or it didn't happen'). She's chosen over Mr. Incredible for economic reasons, and he's relegated to stay-at-home parent (or as we called Michael Keaton in 1983, MR. MOM - an unacceptable sexist term these days).
Elastigirl enjoys her time in the limelight, while Bob doesn't much like being just Bob. Plus he can't understand why they changed math, as he gets frustrated trying to help Dash with his homework. He's also challenged with Violet's teen angst over a boy, and even moreso over the discovery that Jack Jack has POWERS! In fact, Jack Jack has multiple powers, but as a baby, he has little control - though his battle with a raccoon is not a segment you'll soon forget. Also returning is Frozone - voiced by Samuel L. Jackson (minus his trademark 'MF'er), and costume designer Edna Mode - voiced by director Bird. Other new voices include (Odenkirk's fellow 'Better Call Saul' castmate) Jonathan Banks as Rick Dicker, Isabella Rossellini as the Ambassador, and Sophia Bush as Voyd, one of the new generation supers (which includes Reflux - one you'll just have to experience). The big new villain causing problems for Elastigirl is ScreenSlaver, who hypnotizes large groups of people through their screens - more social commentary on our dependence on technology and the addiction/affliction we have toward device screens. The flood of superhero movies over the years since THE INCREDIBLES exposes the not-so-complex story in this one, but it's terrific that the film keeps much of the original look and feel, and yet brings something new ... baby Jack Jack is a star!Filled with the beautiful colors and art design we've come to take for granted from Pixar, the film also features some of the best action sequences you'll see in any movie. The train sequence with Elastigirl is simply spectacular - as is the final action sequence. It's also nice to see the flip in gender roles as Mom (Holly Hunter) takes the lead. Michael Giacchino returns as the composer and he blends in a touch of James Bond theme with his wonderful work. If the film needed extra credit (which it doesn't), certainly the inclusion of a 'Jonny Quest' clip would qualify. Family films don't get much better than this, and even though it runs 2 hours, the closing credits feature the theme song for each of the superheroes, and could easily have been a short film unto itself.Speaking of short films, a Pixar tradition is to include one before new releases. This time it's BAO, a Chinese mother/son and food-oriented story from director Domee Shi (animator on INSIDE OUT)",8,27,77,13 June 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," Fare Thee Well
","Greetings again from the darkness. If you are a follower of the  filmmaking Coen Brothers, then you are quite aware of their complete  lack of artistic interest in any traditionally successful character.  Their work is inspired by life's obstacles and tough luck, even if  brought on by a character's own poor judgment. Coen Brother stories  revolve around those who carry on and have (blind?) faith that their  approach, no matter how ill conceived, is the only option ... the only  path worth taking. Their main character this time out seems to think  life is filled with only careerists (sell-outs) or losers (those who  can't get a break).  The titular Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) is introduced to us  onstage at the Gaslight singing a beautiful folk song. Moments later he  is lying in the back alley after taking a whipping from a mysterious  stranger. It's not until this scene is repeated again at the film's end  do we understand the cause of this effect. See, Llewyn is not a very  likable guy. We learn he is still grieving from the suicide of his  musical partner (as sung by Marcus Mumford), and that he bounces from  sofa to sofa amongst acquaintances and family members. Llewyn has no  friends, only acquaintances too kind to throw him out ... even if he  might be the father of an unwanted baby, or if he accidentally allows a  beloved pet cat to escape.  The story is based in the folk music scene of 1961 Greenwich Village in  the pre-Bob Dylan days. The Coen's were inspired by the memoirs of Dave  Van Ronk entitled 'The Mayor of MacDougal Street'. So while the songs  are real and the characters are often inspired or based upon real  artists of the time, Llewyn's story is pure Coen fiction. That means  cringing, levels of discomfort, uneasy chuckling and moments of rapture  ... such as John Goodman evoking a drugged out Doc Promus spewing harsh  poetic diatribes.  We never really know if the Coens are making a statement or tossing it  out for us to debate. Are they saying that even the ugliness of  Llewyn's personality can produce something as beautiful as music, or  are they saying that we get tricked by beautiful music into thinking  that the artist must also be pure? Carey Mulligan (as Jean) has one of  the film's best and most insightful lines when she tells Llewyn he is  'King Midas' idiot brother'. Her pure disgust (and expert rendering of  the F-word) and anger contrasts with her angelic onstage persona with  husband Jim (Justin Timberlake).  As always, the Coens provide us a constant flow of interesting and  oddball characters. In addition to Goodman's jazz hipster, we get  Garrett Hedlund as an ultra cool (til he's not) valet, Adam Driver as a  cowboy folk singer, Troy Nelson as a virtuous Army folk singer (based  on Tom Paxton), and Llewyn's Upper East side cat owners, his spunky  sister, and best of all F Murray Abraham as Bud Grossman, the owner of  Chicago's Gate of Horn club. Based on the real Albert Grossman who  discovered Peter, Paul and Mary, and managed Bob Dylan, Grossman is the  lone witness to Llewyn's audition. This may be the most touching  musical moment of the movie ('The Death of Queen Jane'), but it's  clearly the wrong song for the moment.  Oscar Isaac is exceptional as Llewyn Davis. He captures that crisis of  self that's necessary for an artist whose talent and passion is just  out of step with societal changes. We feel his pain, but fail to  understand the lack of caring he often displays towards others. We get  how his need for money overrides his artistic integrity as he  participates in the novelty song 'Please Mr Kennedy'. Why Isaac's  performance is not garnering more Oscar chat is beyond my  understanding. It's possibly due to the fact that the movie and his  character are not readily accessible to the average movie goer. Some  thought and consideration is required.  If you are expecting a feel good nostalgic trip down the folk singer  era of Greenwich Village, you will be shocked and disappointed.  Instead, brace yourself for the trials of a talented musician who  believes the music should be enough. Speaking of music, the immensely  talented T Bone Burnett is the man behind the music and it's  fascinating to note how he allows the songs to guide us through the  story and keep us ever hopeful of better days. This is the Coen  Brothers at their most refined and expert.",8,114,141,15 December 2013
Sin City," That's a Mighty Fine Coat
","Greetings again from the darkness. Very loyal adaptation of the graphic novels of Frank Miller, who also receives directing credit and is seen in the movie as a priest. The driving force behind the movie is the always fascinating Robert Rodriguez ('Once Upon a Time In Mexico'). Legend has it that the opening scene with Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton was filmed by Rodriguez and delivered as a gift to Miller in an effort to gain the writer's approval to make this film. What we see here is the total Rodriguez vision.The incredibly deep cast jumps in with both feet and we do get the real feel of the graphic novels (don't call them comic books!). Rodriguez uses color sparingly to prevent the ad nauseum view of blood and to capitalize on the always night, always rainy scenes. The splashes of color are very dramatic and are usually red (blood, sheets, cars) with a few exceptions, such as the crystal blue eyes of Alexis Bledel ('Tuck Everlasting' 'Gilmore Girls').A few of the many characters really stand out. Mickey Rourke, Benecio del Toro and Brittany Murphy all nail their characters and it is always a pleasure to watch Michael Madsen pull off another twisted character. The weaker links are Jessica Alba (yeah, I know, who cares if she can't act) and Rosario Dawson. Bruce Willis and Powers Boothe are fine in their roles, but the most delightful character is Miho played by stoic Chanel model Devon Aoki (daughter of Benihana founder Rocky Aoki). Not sure how much Elijah Wood got paid, but it had to be the easiest money he ever made. My biggest complaint with the film is the miscasting of Clive Owen as Dwight.Overall, Rodriguez delivers another signature, unique film with great characters, music and cars. He has such a visual style that it is always an education to watch his films. Doesn't hurt to have his best bud, QT, listed a guest director!",8,0,5,2 April 2005
The Ugly Truth," Just Ugly
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Robert Luketic has never been able to recapture the charm of his Legally Blonde film, which in fact, was only charming due to Reece Witherspoon. Since then: Tad Hamilton, Monster in Law, 21 and now this wretched project. The battle of the sexes can be funny, but not in a tired cliché, slap you upside the head, hey let's throw in some raunchy stuff way.Katherine Heigl (Grey;s Anatomy) has somehow become the least desirable beautiful woman on planet earth. Could be that her characters are all the same - unlikeable! I thought she was really good in a little film called Side Effects, but since then has devolved into a 30 yr old wench.Gerard Butler somehow manages to maintain a bit of dignity in the film. A true man;s man in 300, he has proved to be mainstream enough in PS, I Love You and now this one ... he just needs a better script, director and supporting cast.Speaking of supporting cast, aside from a couple of chuckles from the talented Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins, did anyone stop to think that an interesting side character or sub-plot might help? Or did they assume only simple minded women would even pay to see this? Either way, the only way it could have been worse is with a horrible soundtrack .... ummm ... yep, you got it ... pure garbage. I am done.",3,12,28,25 July 2009
Gangs of New York," So realistic!
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Martin Scorcese has crafted a masterpiece epic that puts you smack in the middle of the gang wars that were a part of the foundation of our country.  The shame is many will not see this movie because some critics are panning it as too long or too hard to follow or because it has Leonardo DiCaprio or Cameron Diaz in key roles. First of all, this movie should be seen by any film lover if only to see Daniel Day-Lewis('The Unbearable Lightness of Being' 'My Left Foot') in his finest performance.  He is  frighteningly menacing as William Cutting, aka Bill The Butcher.  He has captured the spirit of this dreadful man, from his cocky walk to his handling of cuttlery.  His sneers and voice will send chills up your spine.  This is the best performance I have seen in a long time.  As a selfish film lover, I do wish this wonderfully talented man would work more often!  Leonardo, now cast as a 20 something man, is forced to carry much of the film, and he does an admirable job.  He does have screen presence, and I believe his acting ability is coming around.  Cameron Diaz adds chirpiness and spice to the otherwise drab life of the gang members.  Other nice performances include Jim Broadbent ('Moulin Rouge') as Boss Tweed, Henry Thomas ('ET'), John C. Riley (all PT Anderson films) and Brandon Gleeson, who steals his scenes as Monk.  Liam Neeson also has a short, but crucial role.  Quick notes: look for Scorcese in a quick cameo, and he also cast Brandon DeSica (grandson of the great director Vittorio DeSica) as another tribute to Italian filmmaking.  Incredible sets and superb editing and soundtrack make this an incredible piece of filmmaking not to be missed.",9,0,1,23 December 2002
The Cabin in the Woods," What our dreams are from
","Greetings again from the darkness. Well I was not ready for the horror genre to be turned on its ear, but that's exactly what co-writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (also director) have done here. Rest assured that your favorite aspects of horror films will be lampooned, or at least parodied. There are times you will jump and laugh simultaneously, but mostly I found myself checking off the influences/targets of the filmmakers.There is no way to comment on this film without offering up spoilers, and I will not do that. What I can tell you is that you'll be reminded of films such as Scream, Friday the 13th, Bubba Ho-Tep, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Saw, and dare I say, elements of The Twilight Zone ... you know the parts where you know there is more going on than you are seeing, but you can't quite put it all together.The movie starts out with a tongue-in-cheek assembly of generic characters from most horror films: the fun-loving jock (Chris Hemsworth, pre-Thor), the 'bad' girl (Anna Hutchison), the 'good' girl (Kristen Connolly), the brainiac (Jesse Williams), and of course the comic relief stoner waxing philosophical (a very effective Fran Kranz). This group piles into a borrowed RV and heads to the cabin. And yes, we get the obligatory stop at the run down gas station manned by the straight-from-Deliverance attendant played by Tim De Zarn.We learn quickly that something odd is going on and our heroes are really playthings in some kind of cosmic game being conducted at an underground lab run by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. That much is shown in the trailer and that's the end of what I can say. After that, the choice is yours ... just like in the basement.I have no idea who to recommend this to because the last 15 minutes are pure mayhem, and you will either be fully onboard with this Disneyland ride gone bad, or you will have wanted to leave for the past hour. The movie was selected for opening night at SXSW and it truly is a twisted, even demented jab at all things horror. Only you can decide what comes next.",6,2,9,21 April 2012
Spectre," Homage
","Greetings again from the darkness. Don't come to me looking for objective judgment on Bond. By the time we hear that familiar opening trumpet blast of Marty Norman's Bond theme, I've already been swept away into the land of MI6 enchantment – gadgets, cars, women, over-the-top stunts, globe-trotting, global villains and quintessential coolness. And it doesn't help that this time director Sam Mendes treats this 24th (official) Bond film as an homage to those that came before. At times it plays like a tribute – and maybe even a closing chapter (for Mendes and Daniel Craig?).A long tracking shot drops us into the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico, complete with skeleton masks and giant parade props. We follow a masked couple as they maneuver through the crowd and into their hotel room, where 007 quickly leaps out the window and makes his way across roof tops towards his mission. It's one of the more visually stimulating and explosive openings in franchise history.The story combines the personal back-story of Bond's childhood with his relentless pursuit of the evil empire known as Spectre  the crime syndicate that has been part of the Bond universe for many years and films. The tie-in to the iconic Bond nemesis Blofeld, this new mastermind Franz Oberhauser, and Bond's adoptive family make for an interesting chain of custody. However, as is customary, it's the characters and action sequences that deliver the entertainment bang.Oberhauser is played by Christoph Waltz (understated given his track record), and the two Bond 'ladies' are played by Lea Seydoux (the daughter of Mr. White, and the key to finding Spectre), and Monica Bellucci (the widow of Bond's Mexico victim). Mr. Waltz takes advantage of his limited screen time, while Ms. Bellucci is limited to a few lines and a chance to model some lingerie. Reprising their roles are Rory Kinnear as Tanner, Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw as Q, and Jesper Christensen as Mr. White. New to the mix is Dave Bautista as Hinx (in the mode of Oddjob and Jaws), and Andrew Scott as C  the latest of those trying to shut down the '00' program. Whishaw brings a nice element to his role, while Bautista's Hinx gets to participate in both a car chase and train fight  while uttering only a single word of dialogue.The evil doers have gotten more intellectual over the years, and Oberhauser and Spectre have the goal of global surveillance and controlling information and data. It's a modern theme for a Bond film that also seems intent on reminiscing. There are nods to most (if not every) previous Bond film via (among other things) Nehru jackets, cats, scars, and a white dinner jacket. And it's nice to see the gun barrel sequence back in the opening credits where it belongs. As for the new song, Sam Smith has a very nice voice, but his Bond song lacks the punch of the best.In terms of globe-trotting, we get Mexico, Rome, Tangier (Morocco), London and Austria. The (prolonged) car chase occurs on the deserted streets (and steps) of Rome and features two stunning cars – Aston Martin DB10 and Jaguar C-X75. In addition to the cars and previously mentioned train, it's helicopters that earned a couple of worthy action sequences.It's Daniel Craig's fourth turn as Bond, James Bond. He brings his own brand of emotion and cheekiness, while also possessing a physicality that allows the action sequences to work. He has made the role his, much like Christian Bale took ownership of Batman. For those who refuse to accept the new generation, director Mendes delivers enough nostalgia that even the old-timers should be entertained. R.I.P. Derek Watkins",7,14,27,8 November 2015
Joy," Mop up this mess
","Greetings again from the darkness. The movie is inspired by the true story of entrepreneur Joy Mangano (listed here as an Executive Producer) and her 1990 invention of the Miracle Mop. You should know that neither 'Mangano' nor 'Miracle Mop' is mentioned, and much of the story sprung from the mind of writer/director David O Russell. Also, if you have been a fan of Mr. Russell's past few films (American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter), you should be warned that even though there is a large cast of familiar supporting players, it doesn't play like his usual ensemble piece, but rather as a true star vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence (who plays Joy).This is a working class Italian-American family, and the multi-generational aspect is in full play as Joy (a single, working mom) and her two kids share the house with Mimi (Joy's grandmother played by Diane Ladd), Joy's mom (Virginia Madsen) who is a recluse dressed in 60's party attire and addicted to daytime soap operas, and Joy's dad (Robert DeNiro) and her ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) who share the basement. Tony is the rare combination of slacker-Tom Jones impersonator. Also involved are Joy's agitating and envious step-sister Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm) and Dad's new wealthy girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini). This family makes The Royal Tenenbaums look suburban stale.Flashbacks and dreams, along with the supportive words of Mimi, convince us that Joy is a creative genius, whose once promising abilities have been stifled by the harsh realities of raising kids, and overseeing a bunch of free-loaders who mostly never miss a chance to steal a bit of Joy's light. All of that changes one day thanks to glass shards in her palm and the close proximity of crayons and drawing paper. Poof! Just like that, Joy has invented a revolutionary new kind of mop.Given her family history and current situation, even when things go right for Joy, they never go all the way right. Having to borrow money from Trudy and depend on those who may or may not have her best interest at heart, makes for an endless chain of obstacles and challenges. But Joy is all about perseverance and self-actualization. The story emphasizes Joy's stick-to-it-ness, and the process of learning about the legalities and pitfalls of starting and running one's own business. Even those who should be supportive often ridicule and voice their doubts.The film shifts when Joy meets Neal Walker (Bradley Cooper) who runs QVC. This was the time period when TV home shopping was in its infancy. Joan Rivers (played here by her daughter Melissa) was one of the early stars, and Joy's Miracle Mop was one of the early successes. It's a new world to Joy, but she's a quick study and her tough-mindedness and sense of fairness and right come in to play on multiple occasions. The above is much more story than I would typically describe, but it helps make the point that although Jennifer Lawrence continues to prove she is something quite special as an actress, the story is a bit of a mess and the pacing of the film is clumsy – slapstick blended with ultra-serious. It's impossible to connect with this oddball group of folks, who mostly seem to be pulled right off of various TV sitcoms. Even using the soap opera (complete with Susan Lucci, Donna Mills, and Laura Wright) as a parallel to Joy's life never quite works.Jennifer Lawrence's performance deserves to be ranked right with Joan Crawford's in Mildred Pierce, but the different styles of the two movies results in only one being unforgettable. Director Russell mines the fractured family/group in many of his projects, and given his immense talent, we can be sure future projects will be more in line with the level of his recent past.",6,4,11,26 December 2015
Moon," Hey, Gepetto, Wake Up
","Greetings again from the darkness. Extremely interesting first feature from writer/director Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie). The issue I often have with sci-fi is its lack of humanity. Funny to me that this one is loaded with humanity and emotions and psyche, yet it is centered around human cloning! Sam Rockwell is outstanding as the poor guy 'sentenced' to 3 years of isolation on the other side of the moon in order to deliver energy back to earth. Of course, we (and he) find out that Sam is actually programmed to last 3 years before being disposed of and replaced by a new Sam.Prefer not to discuss any more about the film than that, but will say it does a very good job of examining isolation and a full spectrum of other human emotions ... not to mention the scientific possibilities that may be on the horizon. Lastly, the voice of GERTY is provided by Kevin Spacey. There aren't too many other voices that would give me LESS confidence that things are going to be alright!",7,1,4,5 July 2009
Her," What is Love?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Well critics have been raving about this film so strongly and for so long that I almost feel guilty going against the grain. Almost. Where they see a masterpiece with insight into love and self, I see an implausible story bordering on ludicrous.Writer/director Spike Jonze is an incredibly creative filmmaker. His Adaptation and Being John Malkovich are two movies I can watch repeatedly. I was a fan of his film version of Where The Wild Things Are, but this one just brought me nothing but annoyance, frustration and irritation.Rather than defend my minority stance, I'll just admit to not being onboard with this one. I have always believed we should each judge a film by how it touches us ... how we connect with it. I was neither touched nor connected.What I will say is the premise of technology replacing human interaction for some in the near future is not unthinkable and has already happened for some. But to say that a real relationship ... that true love ... can not just occur, but become commonplace between people and machines just simply contradicts what I believe comprises true love.The film is extremely well made and visually beautiful. The acting is superb: Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Amy Adams are all terrific. Voice acting is spot on including Scarlett Johansson, Brian Cox, Kristen Wiig, and even Spike Jonze. But falling in love with an operating system? Maybe what Osgood Fielding III said at the end of Some Like it Hot is really true ... 'Nobody's perfect'.",3,1,8,11 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," It is Written
","Greetings again from the darkness. What a terrific story and interesting film to watch! One of my favorite overlooked films of the past five years is 'Millions', also directed by Danny Boyle (best known for 'Trainspotting'). The screenplay is by Simon Beaufoy ('Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day' and 'The Full Monty') and is based on Vikas Swarup's novel 'Q&A'. Not really sure how to describe this other than a classic love story wrapped in a rags-to-riches story of survival.We get a glimpse of India's underbelly without it being a guilt-ridden social statement. The movie is actually three parts interwoven beautifully. The working class pauper is having a nice run of success on 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'. Of course his success brings with it the assumption of cheating. As he is being wickedly tortured and questioned by the police, we are provided flashbacks into Jamal's childhood which explain each of the answers he 'miraculously' knows.The only actor most American audiences will recognize is Irfan Khan as the sadistic police interrogator. Mr. Khan will be remembered as the wise father in 'The Namesake'. Despite that, the acting is superb and we are treated to story lines of our three main characters at three different stages in their life.This is purely expert film-making with a creative and multi-faceted story. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who enjoys interesting entertainment and appreciates Mr. Boyle's expertise.",9,3,6,22 November 2008
The Nice Guys," Chuckle Chuckle Bang Bang
","Greetings again from the darkness. Shane Black sold his first screenplay at a very early age which led him to become something of a phenom with the success of that film, Lethal Weapon (1987). Later, he disappeared from Hollywood for about 10 years before resurfacing in 2005 by directing his own terrific script with the immensely entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (my favorite movie of that year), and then hitting big-budget time with his script for Iron Man 3. This time, Mr. Black (directing and co-writing with Anthony Bagarozzi) returns to the detective-farcical-comedy-mystery-action genre and even adds an element of being a 1970's period piece.Black's rapid-fire wise-cracks were perfect fits for Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr, and for this project he's working with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe  both fine actors, though neither known for their comedic work. What's clear from the beginning of the film is that both Gosling and Crowe are fully committed to the material and their respective characters. Gosling plays a boozy Private Detective and single dad who just can't quite get things right, while Crowe plays a hired-hand bruise type – think of his Bud White in L.A. Confidential (1997), only with an extra 50 pounds and a lot of miles. These two damaged boys play off each other very well, and with Black's dialogue and visual gags, the film provides a good number of laugh out loud moments  more silly than the sophomoric humor that's so pervasive at multiplexes these days.Of course for comedy to really click, there needs to be some type of story to follow. In the opening scene a young boy (Ty Simpkins) watches as a car slams through his house, culminating with a 'model/actress' named Misty Mountains meeting a not-so-pleasant ending. We then learn that Gosling's Holland has been hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ms. Mountains – with two significant exceptions. Simultaneously, Amelia has hired Crowe's Jackson to convince Holland to stop searching for her. Soon enough, Holland and Jackson are working together on the 'case' that mixes in the Auto industry (Big 3), Porn industry, Justice Department (government conspiracies), environmental protesters, Killer Bees, LA parties, LA smog, The Waltons (John Boy), The Rockford Files, Detroit, and Richard Nixon  all hot topics in this 1977 era.As much as the story is needed, it really doesn't much matter. This is a movie of moments  some of them featuring funny words, while others focus on pretty astute physical comedy. Gosling (and his stunt double) provides some pretty impressive gags as he is bounced and slammed around for most of the run time. The surprising heart of the film  and moral core  is Holland's daughter Holly played by Angourie Rice. Despite the title, she is really the only 'nice guy' in the whole film, and her good-hearted nature keeps us rooting for Gosling and Crowe, despite their flaws.Other support work comes from Matt Bomer as a 'John Boy' hit man, Keith David, Lois Smith, Yaya DaCosta (quick, name another Yaya), Beau Knapp (as the toothy Blueface), Jack Kilmer (Val's son as a 'projectionalist'), and Kim Basinger (re-teaming with her LA Confidential co-star, Crowe). Also playing a significant role are the mid-to-late 1970's vehicles, the period music and houses and décor that puts us right in the moment, and the clothes and hairstyles that are sure to inspire a chuckle or two.Fans of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang will surely find plenty of laughter here  despite one of the worst trailers in recent memory and even if the film is lacking the one thing it advertises – nice guys.",7,2,6,29 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Retaliate First
","Greetings again from the darkness. Thirty years have passed since we last saw Mel Gibson donning the leather in 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, which was of course, the third in the franchise after Mad Max (1979), and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981). Over the years, rumors have persisted that writer/director George Miller was going to add to the franchise and take full advantage of today's high-tech movie making techniques by securing the budget necessary for a true blockbuster. It may have taken 3 decades, but Mr. Miller's dream is realized with his $100 million version (compared to $300,000 budget on the first one) that will undoubtedly satisfy the Mad Max fans, while also reminding the industry what an action movie can be (Michael Bay's corneas may burst into flames watching this).Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky, a loner haunted by a tragic past seen only through millisecond flashbacks that occur at both inopportune and opportune moments. Hardy has the physicality to pull off the role, but despite the title and the history, this film belongs at least as much to Charlize Theron who literally drives the story as Imperator Furiosa. Tired of living under tyrannical rule, Furiosa frees a group of 'breeders' played by Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough (Elvis Presley's granddaughter), Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton. Their plan is to escape across the desert (well, everything is desert these days) and return to Furiosa's childhood home known as 'the green place'.This is pretty much a two hour chase sequence featuring monster vehicles, soaring motorcycles, massive gunfire, screen-filling explosions, and enough stunt work to amaze even the casual movie-goer. All of this is accompanied by ear-bursting high-octane music courtesy JunkieXL (the first Max films were scored by Brian May of Queen). Some of this 'music' is raw heavy-metal shredding occurring live on one of the chase vehicles – quite a sight and sound gag. It should be noted that stunt work is the surprise here. These days, most movies rely on CGI effects, while Mr. Miller mixes an extraordinary number of old school stunts with the compliment of CGI for such things as an overwhelming sandstorm and Ms. Theron's mechanical arm. It's a fascinating blend of old and new.John Seale certainly deserves mention. He is an Academy Award winning cinematographer for The English Patient, and has also been DP on films such as Rain Man, Witness, Dead Poet's Society and The Firm. He has four Oscar nominations and is not the first cinematographer one would think of when putting together a huge action film; however, the choice pays off in what is a beautifully shot film – both in space and close up scenes. It brings an element of propriety to what on the surface appears to be out-of-control, non-stop chaos.The post-apocalyptic look and feel is accented by periodic splashes of color that prevent the usual bleakness from others in this genre. Many will be surprised at the minimal dialogue, but the straightforward plot removes any need for extended conversations from folks simply trying to survive.Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies) may be the most interesting of all characters, and probably has the most lines of dialogue (while still not saying much). He is a slave caught up in the dream of serving his master, while then re-discovering a modicum of humanity buried somewhere deep inside. Fans of the series will also cheer the presence of Hugh Keays-Byrne who plays the very striking Immortan Joe, and also played Toe Cutter in the original film 37 years ago.Filled with nostalgia and respect for the original series, this fourth entry also provides a new palette for a new generation of fans. The biggest change comes from the focus on strong women who are out to change, or at least escape, a world rotted by the male lust for power. It's difficult to say insanity rules this world, because so little sanity exists that rational beings are non-existent.George Miller will always be known as the creator of the Mad Max series, but we shouldn't forget that he also directed the Happy Feet movies, as well as Babe: Pig in the City. Perhaps those two personalities allow him to create a world as crazed and chaotic as we see in his latest Max film. Mostly we can feel happy for him that he was afforded the opportunity realize his filmmaker dream  a nice reward for 30 years of patience.",6,4,9,17 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," respect
","Greetings again from the darkness. Why doesn't every high school student learn about Desmond Doss in History class? Beyond that, why isn't Desmond Doss profiled in every Psychology and Philosophy class? It's inexplicable that more Americans aren't familiar with his story, much less failing to honor his legacy with a well deserved tribute. Fortunately director Mel Gibson (Braveheart) and screenwriters Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner) and Robert Schenkkan ('The Pacific') bring us a spirited look at this under-appreciated American war hero.Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Desmond Doss and perfectly embodies the conviction and dedication of this extraordinary (not hyperbole in this case) man. See, Desmond Doss was one of the first conscientious objectors in the U.S. Army. His religious beliefs (Seventh Day Adventist) prohibited him from using a weapon or killing another person  two things that don't go over well with fellow soldiers or commanding officers. Yet, Doss was committed to serving his country as a medic and saving lives, rather than taking them.Unbelievable may be the best description even though his story is absolutely true. Credited with saving the lives of at least 75 wounded soldiers, Doss and his fellow soldiers are depicted in the film fighting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge  a topographical challenge punctuated by the need to climb a rope wall in order to scale the face of the cliff. Their reward was facing thousands of Japanese hiding in tunnels and bunkers, waiting patiently to kill in mass. There will be no spoilers here on the courageous actions of Doss  you should see for yourself.The early part of the film features a heart-warming first love story involving Desmond Doss and Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer, The Choice). Watching young love bloom is precious and provides a stark contrast to the battle scenes. The two make a lovely couple and we can't help but root for them. Once Doss hits basic training, we find Vince Vaughn in the role of Sergeant Howell, Sam Worthington (failing to hide his Aussie accent) as Captain Glover, and Luke Bracey (Point Break, 2015) as Smitty, one of the soldiers who initially has no interest in serving with Doss. The Army Psychologist is played by Richard Roxburgh, whom movies lovers will recognize as The Duke from Moulin Rouge! (2001).Some of the best scenes involve Desmond's parents played by screen vets Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Both are excellent in roles requiring very different and extreme emotional moments. It's a credit to Gibson's filmmaking expertise that he is able to add depth to all aspects – family turmoil, a classic love story, the brutality of war, and the deep religious convictions. There are a few moments of 'artistic license' and some of the CGI is inconsistent and even over-produced at times, but the intensity of the battle scenes rival that of Saving Private Ryan and the landing at Omaha Beach. It's a passionate piece of filmmaking centered on a most passionate man. You may disagree with much of what Mel Gibson has said and done in his personal life (and I hope you do), but as a film director he has earned much respect. And speaking of respect  Desmond Doss. Enough said.",8,9,17,3 November 2016
The Runaways," Starry, Starry Night
","Greetings again from the darkness. Getting dragged back to the mid-70's can be quite fun, especially when the topic is rock 'n roll. Based on lead singer Cherie Currie's autobiography, this film provides an overview of the formation, sudden fame, and equally sudden dismantling of the first all-girl's rock band, The Runaways.Joan Jett was the heart of the band, but it took oddball music producer Kim Fowley to put the band together and get the recording deal. Fowley may be the most interesting character in this story. Here he is played with force by the very talented Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road).Instead, the story focuses on Cherie Currie and Joan Jett, mostly Currie, since it is her book! Dakota Fanning plays Cherie Currie as a confused 15 year old with a messed up family life. The family includes a mom, played by Tatum O'Neal, who announces she is getting married and moving to Indonesia. Currie's dad is a very sick alcoholic, so she is an easy recruit for Fowley and Jett. Jett is played balls-out by Kristen Stewart. Yes, Kristen Stewart from Twilight. Here she shows much more of the talent we saw prior to the Twilight series. She captures the fire and spirit of Joan Jett and leaves little doubt she will pursue her dreams despite all obstacles.Overall, the script comes up short and provides us little more than headlines and a quick glimpse. Would have expected much more on talented guitarist Lita Ford, who continues to work today. For a quick intro to the story of The Runaways, this one is fine. Just don't expect much depth.",6,34,54,20 March 2010
Me Before You," for the hanky-loving crowd
","Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good cry in a dark movie theatre? The first feature film from director Thea Sharrock is taken directly from the tear-jerker novel by Jojo Meyes (who also wrote the screenplay). Although I try to avoid using the term very often, it's very much a by-the-numbers chick flick  complete with the heart-of-gold working class girl trying her best to 'save' the handsome rich guy to whom life has dealt a tough hand. For fans of the book and the genre, it should deliver the desired effect  the studio even provided movie logo tissues for the screening.For most of us, the effectiveness of this type of movie comes down to the characters. Luisa is the effervescent working class girl hired as a personal assistant to the extremely wealthy quadriplegic Will Traynor. Emilia Clarke ('Game of Thrones') does everything in her power to make us (and Will Traynor) like Luisa. To describe her as optimistic is like saying Eric Clapton can play guitar. Calling her perky would be like saying Donald Trump has hair. Both statements are true, but hardly capture the totality of reality. In stark contrast, Sam Claflin (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay) purposefully underplays Will  the one time cliff-diving, James Bond birthday video type now confined to a wheelchair.Lu is a constant toothy smile complemented by expressive and active eyebrows that somehow overshadow her chatty bedside manner, and kaleidoscopic and geometric clothes and shoes  all encompassed with an ever-bouncy step that would make Tigger envious. Lu mostly shares the screen with Will and the personal nurse and therapist Nathan, played by Stephen Peacocke. The camera certainly loves all three of these faces, and director Sharrock wisely adds Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents. They bring a regal presence to what otherwise could have played a bit too cutesy.Despite the heavy dose of 'awww', the story deserves credit for touching on the 'right to die' or 'dying with dignity' debate. While those closest to Will selfishly proclaim they don't understand his plan to head to Switzerland, it's Nathan who says it best  'who am I to judge'. While a full on discussion of the topic would be out of place here, the film does a nice job of not shying away from the process.Other recognizable faces in the cast include Jenna Coleman ('Doctor Who') as Lu's sister and confidante, and Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter series) as Lu's fitness freak boyfriend who isn't very understanding  of either Lu or her job. There's also an odd but welcome wedding cameo from Joanna Lumley. My biggest issue with the story is that I just never understood how or when Lu fell so deeply in love with Will. Sure, I get the appeal of the castle, the concertos, and the tropical vacations, but where was the real personal connection? Was it simply that she thought she could charm Will into changing his mind on the big decision? That's not really love. Another piece that's difficult to take  the numerous musical interludes seemingly designed to make sure viewers are in the proper state of melancholy. There was another segment that I found not just ironic, but actually annoying; however, discussion of the 'Live boldly' advice would give away the film's ending  something I'm not sure even matters since it's made pretty clear throughout, but it still goes against my movie code.",5,35,71,3 June 2016
Donnie Darko," Not your father's easter bunny
","Greetings again from the darkness.  This is not so much a review as a recommendation.  Wonderful offbeat film directed by newcomer Richard Kelly. Really looking forward to future films from Mr. Kelly as Donnie Darko will be tough to top.  Thought-provoking and mesmerizing, the script will play games with your head as you attempt to keep up.  Excellent turn by the well cast Jake Gyllenhaal (October Sky) as Donnie.  He really captures 'all' of the character(s).  Jena Malone first caught my eye in the putrid 'Stepmom' and she shines again here as the only one really trying to accept Donnie. Great to see Katherine Ross back on the screen, albeit with the worst make-up since the original 'Godzilla' films.  Nice cast, nice script, nice directing.  The pressure is on Mr. Kelly ... we're waiting!!",8,1,2,31 March 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The Dark Side of Spock
","Greetings again from the darkness. It would be unfair to analyze, critique or compare this to any 'normal' movie. Being somewhat limited in scope by the source material, director Michael Bay, delivers what the fans want ... full scale noise and all-out action.While he admitted that part two of this trilogy was lacking much, it appears his efforts to improve part three come not from script improvement, but rather by tossing in some familiar Hollywood faces: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey and Ken Jeong. Oh, and we also get Bill O'Reilly, an odd sequence with legendary Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and the best surprise - Leonard Nimoy voicing Sentinel Prime.Most of the same key players are back: Shia LaBeouf as Sam (friend to Optimus Prime), John Turturro (cashed in on his 10 min of fame), Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as soldiers, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents in a couple of throw away scenes that cost much less than the CGI that dominates the movie.While I remain an avid opponent to 3-D, this film offers a few of the best uses since Avatar. Unfortunately the dimmed coloring offset the benefits and continue to annoy me. Just remove your glasses periodically and you can easily see how much brighter the colors are without the 3-D muting. Such a shame.Michael Bay knows explosions. And there are no shortage on display here. We get plenty of rock 'em sock 'em action and the military is on full display, especially with some pretty cool skydiving tactics. Heck, we even get Frances McDormand as a power-hungry bureaucrat. For those who know Chicago, the familiar sights abound. The Wrigley Building plays a vital role, though it still bothers me a bit to see a skyscraper destroyed. I will say the tilted office is not close to the rotating hallway of Inception, though the effort is appreciated.The battle of the robots is what people pay to see and the 40 plus minute final battle is something to behold, even if it drags on entirely too long. And I can't fail to mention that the lack of presence of Megan Fox' character is explained a couple of times as having 'dumped' Sam. Sam has rebounded nicely with Carly, played by supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who looks just fine in a $200,000 Mercedes, a slim white dress or conversing with an injured villainous robot. Yes, one must maintain a sense of humor during the film.The use of slo-motion, the ties to the space program, and the connection to Chernobyl are all a bit heavy-handed, but this is a Transformers movie, not a documentary. And the actual transformation of these guys is still one of the coolest on screen moments you can find ... even if the story and dialogue will have you desperate for brain resuscitation when the movie finally ends.",5,1,6,2 July 2011
The Social Network," Will you be my friend?
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is a film with good genes. It's based on Ben Mezrich's novel 'The Accidental Billionaires', screenplay by Aaron Sorkin ('West Wing', 'A Few Good Men') and directed by one of the best directors working today, David Fincher ('Fight Club', 'Zodiac'). The film is dialogue driven and my advice is to shift your ears into turbo-mode to keep up. These Harvard types never stammer and are quite speedy in making their oh-so-clever points.This film is not so much the history of Facebook as it is a glimpse into the individuals behind the idea. Foremost, of course, is Mark Zuckerberg (played with rapid-fire tunnel vision by Jesse Eisenberg). The programming guru behind the code, Zuckerberg is depicted as a guy who is not just socially inept, but also unaware of social mores and code. I am not sure if he is best described as a prodigy, genius or even (possibly) a sufferer of Asperger's Syndrome. Whatever he is/was, he became a billionaire in his early 20's by proving he could put together the world's dominant social network while having no redeeming social skills of his own. Fascinating.Zuckerberg's best and only friend (and business partner) is Eduardo Saverin (played by the next Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield). Saverin fronted the money to get Facebook started and was one of the parties who borough suit against Zuckerberg claiming he was cheated out his place in the company.The third key player is the infamous Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake). Founder of Napster and Plaxo, Parker manages to get his hooks into Zuckerberg and apparently was behind the snubbing of Saverin. This is the most charismatic role in the film (and real life), yet also the role that may have the most dramatic license taken.The story is told in non-linear form, weaving multiple depositions from different lawsuits. One includes the Winklevoss twins from Harvard who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea. They later settled for millions.As I said, this is not so much a history of Facebook as it is a display of the characters involved. These are all brilliant people who are also ignorant to the ways of the world. It seems they all have significantly different goals, yet never really stop to agree on strategy. Instead, the growth is non-stop, as is the back-stabbing.Interestingly, the film uses a girl (Rooney Mara) in the opening scene as the single biggest influence on Zuckerberg's brainstorm. Her rejection of his self-centered speed-talking kicks his wheels in motion and his relentless energy never slows for the rest of the story. One thing is clear, Zuckerberg did not single-handedly create Facebook and there is little doubt some key people were given short straws along the way. No matter what really happened as all that was battled out behind closed records in the settlements. What we do know is that Facebook now has over 500 million users worldwide.This is an extremely well crafted movie, though in my opinion, none of the acting is up to the script. It's a film that provides enough insight into the players and enough entertainment for the ticket. That's really sufficient. Coming next ... David Fincher is set to direct and Rooney Mara is cast as Lisbeth in the Americanized version of the fabulous Swedish hit, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'. So enjoy this one and look forward to that one!",7,3,7,1 October 2010
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Criminal War
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Bosnian War is not something most Americans know much about. The cursory western media coverage was matched by the hands-off approach from the UN, until the very end. This movie doesn't shy away from exposing the atrocities of ethnic cleansing and genocide that occurred against civilians. The comparisons to Nazi war camps are inescapable.This is no place for a history lesson, and I would certainly not be the one to supply it, but some basics are required to somewhat understand what's going on. The reign of Yugoslavian President Tito lasted until his death in 1980. Although much criticism is directed his way, he was able to maintain a society that allowed the co-existence of Bosniak Muslims and Orthodox Serbs. You might recall that in 1984, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics. Not long after that, the republics began skirmishes that eventually escalated to a complicated civil war lasting from 1992-95 (The Bosnian War).The film makes no attempt to capture the full scope of the war, instead choosing a microscopic approach by focusing on two people. Danijel (Goran Kostic) and Ajla (Zana Marjanovic) are dancing cozily in a club when a bomb shatters their date and their lives. Danijel goes on to become a mid-level military leader of the Serbs, while Ajla and her Muslim family and friends are torn apart, some even executed. Ajla ends up as a prisoner at the camp Danijel commands. He manages to protect her from the brutal rapes by soldiers by staking a claim on her and putting the order out that she is not to be touched.Ajla is an artist and Danijel is a soldier and their earlier dance evolves into a psychological battle of wits, mistrust and escape. Danijel is clearly not of the mindset to be a brutal killer within a war, yet Ajla constantly observes his every movement and even the slightest change in his approach to her and the war. She does what she needs to survive and he uses her as an escape from the atrocities of his day job. The end result of this relationship is both shocking and inevitable.Danijel's father, Nebojsa, is a senior level military leader who shows up in time to provide us with a brief history lesson dating back 600 years. He takes much pride in the Serbs ability to persevere. Nebojsa is played by Rade Serbedzija, whom many will recognize as the villain from The Saint (1997) and Boris the Blade in Snatch (2000). This is a powerful and frightening character, and we quickly understand why he doubts his son's fortitude. When he finds out about Ajla, we immediately know things are going to get ugly.After the screening, we were fortunate enough to have a discussion panel sponsored by the World Affairs Council. One of the panel members was a former officer in the Bosnian Army who spent time in two separate concentration camps. Viewing the film was very emotional for him and he said it captured the realities as well as a movie possibly could. Of course, we never lose sight of the fact that what we see on screen are not 'real' bullets, not 'real' rape, and not 'real' blood.Purposefully held to the end of my comments is the announcement that the film is written, directed and produced by Angelina Jolie. We are aware of her humanitarian efforts and here she works diligently to tell a story that exposes the realities of war and how humanity can disappear. It's not a perfect film (it runs a bit long), but it tells a powerful story that many of us prefer to pretend doesn't exist. As with the Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens, we can't help but wonder what took NATO forces so long to get involved. Capped by an understated and haunting Gabriel Yared score, the film is tough to watch, but also a brutal reminder that war is the ultimate sacrifice and punishment for real people and real families.",7,100,350,11 January 2012
The Pursuit of Happyness," This Part of My Life
","Greetings again from the darkness. This film has the feel of a Disney movie where the story is just too unbelievable for real life. The difference here is that it is the TRUE story of Chris Gardner. Sure, the story is entirely from his point of view and the only bits we get of his wife are as an angry, bitter, fed up Thandie Newton who just boils over with disgust at her life with Chris.The pleasure in this film is watching the scenes with Will Smith (as Mr. Gardner) and Jaden Smith (his real life son). The spirit of these two and the perseverance the display are very uplifting. Nice support work is offered by Dan Castellanata (voice of Homer Simpson) and Kurt Fuller.Director Gabriele Muccino steps into his first mainstream Hollywood film and does a pretty good job in most scenes. The 'action' scenes of Smith running in the streets are a bit hokey, but I really enjoyed the more personal moments. Overall, pretty good film of an amazing story. Also, don't miss the real Chris Gardner walking past Will Smith and his son at the end ... during the best 'knock-knock' joke ever!",7,1,2,29 December 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," Born to be Bourne, but no supreme direction
","Greetings again from the darkness. I am a huge fan of the first Bourne movie and am now throughly convinced that Matt Damon was truly born to be Bourne. He has always appeared uncomfortable with being an actor (and definitely with being a movie star), so playing Jason Bourne is the perfect match. Bourne is uncomfortable, though, exceptional in most situations whether kicking the crap out of airport security or driving a cool little jeep through the streets of India. Bourne #2 delivers this exciting character into a world where both sides are against him - even his own side.What this one lacks is a great script and professional direction. Director Paul Greengrass seems clueless on shooting action scenes and we rarely know if we are looking at a kneecap, hubcap or ballcap. He seems intent on being stylish rather than capturing the essence of the action. This story was 'based' on Ludlum's character and the story lacks any real spice. We know where it is headed the first time we see the meeting room with Joan Allen (at her usual ice queen level) and Brian Cox (delivering the best line in the movie - 'puddle'). Franka Potente returns as Bourne's babe, though her screen time and lines are far too limited. On the other hand, Julia Stiles gets just enough with her 6 minutes. Karl Urban is an uber-cool bad guy, but of course, this is Matt Damon's film all the way. Some great scenery shots of the world's great cities, but alas, the direction and screenplay prevent this from being all it can be.",7,47,91,26 July 2004
The Great Gatsby," Touch the Green Light
","Greetings again from the darkness. Movie versions of beloved books are always a risky proposition. Devotees of the written word recoil in disgust when a filmmaker dares re-imagine a character or scene, while critics take delight in itemizing each and every stray from the source material. Director Baz Luhrmann is an artist. His canvas is the silver screen, and he thrives in presenting his interpretations and visions. When he agreed to take on F Scott Fitzgerald's 88 year old masterpiece  one that consistently lands on the lists of top ten novels of all-time  he most assuredly prepared for the onslaught of criticism and outrage that would follow (and has). He must have also known that his work would delight and entertain those open-minded viewers not shackled to thoughts of a single 'correct' form (it has).If you have seen Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! (2001) or Romeo + Juliet (1996), then you are prepared for a Gatsby vision significantly different from director Jack Clayton's somber and oft-dreary version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Taking a different route altogether, Luhrmann worked with Jay-Z on the soundtrack that mixes Roaring 20's jazz classics with contemporary hip-hop. He worked with award-winning Costume Designer Catherine Martin (his wife) on creating a kaleidoscope of colors for dazzling outfits that range from Gatsby's pastel suits to the glitzy and sparkling party dresses at his over-the-top parties. Additionally, Luhrmann invoked the newest 3-D technology to add even more emphasis to the visual spectacle that included free-flowing champagne, high-gloss and high-powered automobiles screaming down narrow roads, sky-filling fireworks, and enough glittery confetti to stop down a parade. Jay Gatsby may know how to throw party, but so does Baz Luhrmann.Knowing this movie was coming soon, I re-read Fitzgerald's novel back in January. While I was once again struck by the depressing feeling it leaves you with (it is after all a tragedy), I was also reminded of what stunning prose the writer lays out. At times I find it borders on poetry. You may agree with many of the 1925 critics who claimed the characters are unlikeable and the plot has little to offer, though you must also acknowledge the work acts as a timeless reminder that the vast majority of us could never come close to writing something as beautiful.The cast members are talented and game for Luhrmann's world. Leonardo DiCaprio infuses the Gatsby character with the uncertainty and teetering balance of secrecy that Redford never could. His obsession with Daisy (Carey Mulligan) may be difficult to understand, but then why should obsessive love make sense? Joel Edgerton (as Daisy's husband Tom) is a womanizing brute who sets his own inherited wealth and culture as far apart as East and West Egg. Tobey Maguire's Nick Carraway is our lone claim to normalcy. He is thrust into the Gatsby world and never really understands it  but then who could? The Carraway character is my single biggest complaint in regards to the movie. The framing device of Nick writing the story down for his psychiatrist as part of his therapy, means we get entirely too much Tobey Maguire and Nick Carraway for my tastes.It's also a bit disappointing that we get so little of the strong supporting cast: Isla Fisher as Myrtle, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband, and especially Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan as Meyer Wolfsheim and newcomer Elizabeth Debricki as Jordan Baker are seen and heard from entirely too few times. In fact, the Nick and Jordan connection from the book is mostly ignored. These are all fabulous actors who did what they could with the characters, but we should remind ourselves that Fitzgerald's book was always more about the prose than the characters or plot. He told us what he wanted us to know more than have his characters show us. That was his art form. Baz Luhrmann's art form is showing  and his show is quite a treat!",8,1,2,13 May 2013
13 Hours," The Power of Myth
","Greetings again from the darkness. Given that his last 'true' story movie was Pearl Harbor (2001), and he is best known for the endless stream of Transformers movies (yes, another one is on the way), it's understandable how we could be apprehensive (to say the least) about director Michael Bay taking on the Benghazi story. A sigh of relief is in order as the film pays tribute to those who deserve it while still providing Bay the opportunity to blow stuff up, and display is always-annoying tendencies with a camera.The incredibly courageous soldiers, who comprised the CIA security team (GRS) of contractors that saved many lives, are the heroes of the story and heroes in real life. Bay never loses focus on their bravery and dedication, and avoids the temptation of taking an obvious political stance in telling their story. At the same time, he doesn't shy away from making a weaslley CIA administrator type (played by David Constable) the face of bureaucratic incompetence.The six man team is played in the movie by John Krasinski (as Jack Silva), James Badge Dale (beefed up from his 'Pacific' days as Tyrone 'Rone' Woods), Pablo Schreiber (as Kris 'Tanto' Paronto), David Denman (as Dave 'Boon' Benton), Dominic Fumusa (as John 'Tig' Tiegen), and Max Martini (as Mark 'Oz' Geist). All six actors are clearly proud to represent these men, and though wise-cracks abound, there is absolutely no Hollywood preening or posturing  these are gritty, well-trained, dedicated warriors.So much as been written and debated about what happened during the 2012 siege that resulted in the tragic deaths of four Americans, including that of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. But given the reputations of those in the CIA and the State Department, it's doubtful full disclosure will ever replace the holes of doubt that exist, so studying the action sequences makes sense  though we also get a Joseph Campbell reference. Chuck Hogan adapted Mitchell Zuckoff's book for the film, and in between the rapid gun fire and missiles, that deafening silence you hear is Washington, D.C.",6,9,27,17 January 2016
The Birds," Fussy Chickens
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sure, I have seen this film many times over the years, but just couldn't miss the chance to see it on the big screen courtesy of Fathom Events and Cinemark. Many critics consider this to be Alfred Hitchcock's last great film, and still others dismiss it as a lark. Hitchcock is known for his sterling career of suspense films, though this one is really categorized as horror.The writing pedigree is beyond reproach as it's based on a story by Daphne du Maurier with a screenplay from Evan Hunter. Dame du Maurier is considered one of the best writers of the twentieth century, and you might recognize Mr. Hunter's pen name - Ed McBain. He was quite famous for his detective stories (including the foundation for TV's 'Hill Street Blues').There are really two parts to the film. The set-up involves some playful grown-up flirting between lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren). The scene in the pet store is a treat to watch thanks to the banter between two attractive, intelligent, confident people. The tie-in with the love birds for Mitch's sister (Veronica Cartwright) is simple, yet brilliant. The extreme playfulness takes Hedren to Bodega Bay, California via her sleek Astin Martin.Hitchcock includes his common elements of feminine mystique as Mitch Brenner's world revolves around his omnipresent mother (Jessica Tandy), his younger sister (Cartwright), his ex-lover (Suzanne Pleschette) and now a new love interest in Hedren. There are some terrific scenes between Tandy (26 years prior to Driving Miss Daisy) and Hedren, but my favorites are those with Hedren and Pleschette. Pleschette was an underrated actress and is best known for her role in TV's 'The Bob Newhart Show'. Watching her face as Hedren talks on the phone to Taylor is classic frustration from an ex-lover.The second half of the film involves the terror of the bird attacks. Of course, the infamous scene of the kids running down the street being pecked by birds will make your skin crawl, and the scene where Hedren gets attacked in the bedroom is horrific and sends her into a breakdown. I really enjoy the scenes with the townspeople in the café. Some wonderful interchanges as they each tell bird stories. My favorite bird sequence in the film involves the empty playground equipment slowly taken over by birds as Hedren sits on the bench. Great stuff.Another interesting aspect of the film is the cast. Ms. Hedren (mother of Melanie Griffith) is still acting today (in her 80's), though I have never considered her anywhere near the level of actress of other Hitchcock blondes: Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, Doris Day, etc. Rod Taylor is also in his 80's now and was last seen on screen as Winston Churchill in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. Jessica Tandy had a long career and is best known for Driving Miss Daisy, and Veronica Cartwright went on to star in such films as Alien and The Right Stuff). The supporting cast is filled with familiar faces including a very young Morgan Brittany ('Dallas'), Malcolm Atterbury (as the Deputy), Ruth McDevitt (as the pet store owner) and one of my favorite actor names, Doodles Weaver (Sigourney's uncle).As you watch the film, you will notice that there is no traditional score. Instead, we are treated to an assortment of bird effects which cue us in to the level of danger. Hitchcock was always a master of guiding the viewer right along the path he wanted. This film has some unusual pacing and a few wide shots that are quite rare for his films. To me, it proves that he was always experimenting, yet with an innate ability to know how the audience would react. A true craftsmen.

Sully," He's the Captain now
","Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger has experienced both. On January 15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of US Airways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled 'Miracle on the Hudson'.Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the best of human nature.Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book 'Highest Duty', co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is given to the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review. The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by the ultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his career and reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse than yours and mine.Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing. Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks the hysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, this re-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendants repeated instructions of 'Heads down. Stay down'. Even the cockpit chatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom are real life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-fact manner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as he desperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit 155.Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorable scenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wife of Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully's background with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texas private airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanks is the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewart just fine if it were the 1940's.The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computer simulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, we get the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding human error – naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their 'lost' plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doing their job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, and the first responders were.This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but are glued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handles the cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camera work avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one of the best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intense scrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. The closing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivor would agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life  something that could have gone to the other extreme.",7,172,206,8 September 2016
Cinderella Man," Get Your Dukes Up
","Greetings again from the darkness. We all know Ron Howard is a master of melodrama and sometimes lays it on bit heavy. While 'Cinderella Man' is no exception, the sappy moments are few and are fully offset by the beauty and grace and power of the movie. This is expert film-making and 'Cinderella Man' immediately jumps to the top of the best film of 2005 list.While Howard does a tremendous job of capturing the depression era and the hardships that so many families faced, what may be most impressive is the captivating performances he obtains from the stellar cast. Russell Crowe is pure gold as folk hero and boxing champ James J. Braddock. Crowe commands the screen and his quiet strength makes him perfect for this good and heroic figure. This is the first film since 'Jerry Maguire' that I have not found Renee Zellweger to be over the top and annoying. A tip of the cap to Howard for inducing a more subdued performance from her. Great to see Paddy Considine (so wonderful as Johnny in 'In America') in a meaningful role as Braddock's buddy. Howard also works in his dad, Rance (as ring announcer) and brother Clint (as referee) in what has become a family tradition. The casting of Craig Bierko as Max Baer was brilliant as he is frightening as the hard-hitting (and future father of Jethro Bodine!) heavyweight fighter. Not sure exactly what to say about Paul Giamatti. He wreaks greatness as Braddock's longtime loyal manager. Giamatti will no doubt garner much discussion for a Best Supporting nomination for next year's Oscars. This role is well-written and multi-faceted and Giamatti brings a wonderful spirit to the film.Many already know how the real life story ends, but as with Howard's 'Apollo 13', that in no way distracts from the power of the story or the film. Ron Howard has two upcoming high-profile project: 'The DaVinci Code' and a remake of 'East of Eden'. He could easily secure his place in Hollywood history if he delivers on those films in the same manner he delivers here.",8,0,0,5 June 2005
Jurassic Park," Clever Girl
","There are a few truly awe-inspiring moments in movie history. One of the most memorable occurs when Dorothy steps out of her Black & White farm house and into the full color wonderland of Oz. Not far behind is our first glimpse of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Director Steven Spielberg brilliantly focused on the stunned reactions of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Attler (Laura Dern). We smiled because we knew their reactions mirrored ours! Now, twenty years later, the film has been re-released with a very effective 3D re-mastering.The movie has its place in Hollywood history for its revolutionary use of George Lucas' ILM CGI and the animatronics and visual effects under the supervision of Ray Winston. This was no ordinary science fiction special-effects movie. It was a very interesting, entertaining, thrilling story that brought to life the plastic dinosaur toys of kids and dinosaur dreams of curious adults. This was light years from the Ray Harryhausen stop-action dinosaurs we had seen before. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park had back-stories, childhoods, ferocious roars and a realistic look that tied right into our childhood fantasies.Never-before-seen special effects would be enough to set this one apart, but it's the story and characters that draw us in and elevate the movie to classic status. John Hammond is a very likable, little old rich man played by Sir Richard Attenborough. In fact, Attenborough is genuinely such a nice guy, he was cast as Kris Kringle in the 1994 re-make of Miracle on 34th Street. He is also an Oscar winning director for Gandhi (1982) and ironically beat out Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) that year. Attenborough also directed A Bridge Too Far (1973), A Chorus Line (1985) and Chaplin (1992); plus, one of my favorite hidden gems: Magic (1978). Unfortunately, Attenborough, now almost 90 years old, has recently been moved into hospice for health reasons.John Hammond and his team of scientists have taken 'dino DNA' and brought life to dinosaurs, previously 65 million years extinct. Hammonds' instincts as a showman lead him to develop a kind of amusement park where people can come and see his dinosaur creations in a natural habitat. Facing a lawsuit  what could go wrong??  his investors bring in a team of specialists to inspect the park. Dr. Grant, Dr. Attler and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) take the tour with Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) and a bean counter played by Martin Ferrero. Of course, things go terribly wrong thanks to a sub-plot involving the park's computer guru played by Wayne Knight (Newman from 'Seinfeld'). Don't miss the photo of J Robert Oppenheimer (the atomic bomb creator) on Nedry's computer monitor. Samuel L Jackson has a classic line of dialogue, but also seems to be prepping for his role in Deep Blue Sea (1999). The other key player is the park's game warden played terrifically by the late Bob Peck  he mutters the 'clever girl' line.Real life Paleontoligist Jack Horner worked as an adviser on the film and was the inspiration for the Dr. Grant character. It's also interesting to note that there was quite a bidding war for the rights  even before writer Michael Crichton had finished the manuscript. When Spielberg won the rights, he hired Crichton to write the screenplay, and David Koepp was brought in for the final version. Crichton is also known for Westworld (1973), Twister (1996) and The Andromeda Strain (1971). Mr. Koepp is known for his screenplays that include Mission Impossible (1996), Panic Room (2002) and Spider-Man (2002). And of course, the majestic score was composed by the great John Williams, a frequent Spielberg collaborator. Jurassic Park was nominated for and won three Oscars: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. Many believe Jurassic Park should have nominated for the Best Picture, but I doubt Mr. Spielberg much cares. See, he released another movie that same year  Schindler's List did win the Best Picture Oscar. Many ask about the child actors from Jurassic Park. Tim was played by Joseph Mazzello, who was most recently seen in TV's 'Justified', as the snake-charming traveling preacher. Mr. Mazzello has also appeared in The Social Network, and the mini-series 'The Pacific'. Lexi was played by Ariana Richards and she won the role based on her amazing ability to show and express fear  and her believability as a teenage hacker. Ms. Richards has focused more on her work as an artist, but does act periodically.Jurassic Park is definitely one to experience on the biggest screen possible with the clearest sound possible. This 3D re-mastering is worth the price of admission and I enjoyed seeing the look of awe in the eyes of a few youngsters in the theatre. No need to wait for Jurassic Park 4, which is scheduled for release in 2014  go experience the original in its full big screen glory!",9,2,2,8 April 2013
Valkyrie," I Saw the Blast
","Greetings again from the darkness. Things aren't always as they seem. Colonel Claus von Sauffenberg is convinced he has succeeded in his mission and proceeds to carry out the plan. The really interesting piece is how quickly so many jumped in to assist. There was an entire segment of the German population that did not buy into the Nazi propaganda.Directed by the great Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects), the film shows us one of the 15 reported assassination attempts on Adolph Hitler. The film is beautifully shot and flows very well. My two issues with the film are the difficulty in believing this small group of outcasts could pull this off, and the site of Tom Cruise in nearly every scene.Hard to imagine this film gathering much of a following given the star and the subject matter plus the fact that it is only enjoyable to watch from a technical aspect. The supporting cast is pretty strong and especially good are Tom Wilkinson and Thomas Kretschmann.If this subject matter appeals to you, I would highly recommend the outstanding film 'Downfall'. While Valkyrie is somewhat interesting, that film is downright fascinating.",6,3,9,27 December 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Suckers!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Homer hits it right on the head just as the movie starts when he stands up and asks 'why would anyone pay to see a movie of something they can watch for free on TV?'. This is just a 2 hour episode. Now, it is funny and most enjoyable to watch, but it really doesn't qualify as movie and it certainly doesn't deserve the Top 250 on this site.There is the usual convoluted story from creators Matt Groening and James L. Brooks and 'Monsters, Inc.' director does a pretty decent job of working in the multitude of characters we expect to see. For my money, there was a bit too much Spider-Pig, but I did enjoy the whole dome thing.Bottom line, this is exactly what we would expect from this franchise ... plenty of funny characters, great lines, social commentary and lots of laughs. What is isn't, is a great film.",5,1,4,4 August 2007
The Soloist," The Pigeons are Clapping
","Greetings again from the darkness. Odd fact-based story of one-time musical prodigy-now homeless man Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) and his chance encounter turned friendship with LA Times writer Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.). The story is pretty tough to watch at times but director Joe Wright (Atonement) does a good job of adding enough Hollywood to prevent it from spinning too far off into mental illness and politics.RDJ and Mr. Foxx are both excellent in their presentation of challenging characters. The music is, of course, excellent (Mr. Ayers has a fascination with Beethoven) and we get a glimpse inside the LA symphony hall (designed by Frank Gehry).There were a few continuity issues and some of the scenes were a bit too fluffy for me, but this is such an amazing story that you can't help but find it interesting. First movie I can recall where a lead character has a run in with a urine container ... not once, but twice. And Neil Diamond has a couple of songs and photo, which just adds to the weirdness",7,3,6,26 April 2009
The Martian," Steely Eyed Missile Man
","Greetings again from the darkness. With this week's NASA announcement of the discovery of water on Mars, it seems necessary to point out that director Ridley Scott's latest was not actually filmed on the red planet, but rather in the Jordan desert. OK, maybe not necessary, but it does serve as a reminder that the film (based on the popular book from Andy Weir) may be filled with science  but it's also fiction – hence the label Science-Fiction. If you were one of THOSE who actually paid attention in science classes and read the optional material, then you will probably find much fault in the details. For the rest of us, it's a pretty fun ride.Space has long been a popular movie topic, and a key to such favorites as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien, Aliens, The Right Stuff, Contact, Space Cowboys, Armageddon, Moon, and most recently Gravity and Interstellar. And of course there are the immensely popular franchises of Star Wars and Star Trek, which both chose a different path than the 'grounded' nature of the others. This latest film may actually have as much in common with Cast Away as it does with any of the space-based films.Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and her crew (Matt Damon, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Askal Hennie) are hard at work on their Mars mission when a severe storm causes them to evacuate in panic mode. When the storm hits, Damon's astronaut Mark Watney is lost and presumed dead. Once it's realized that Watney survived and has every intention of being rescued, the film kicks into gear.There are three separate stories we follow: the ingenious and spirited survival mode of Watney, the politics and brilliance of the NASA organization, and the crew who now believes Watney's rescue is their responsibility. The NASA group is led by director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and includes support work from Chiwetel Ejiofar, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, MacKenzie Davis, Donald Glover and Benedict Wong.Taking the approach of an adventure film with the MacGuyver of all Botanists, Damon's charm and humor stand in stark contrast to the annoyances of the two leads from Gravity, and provide a mass appeal that should make this entertaining for most any viewer. This approach allows us to imagine ourselves stranded on Mars, and whether we would panic or consider ourselves Space Pirates. There is also a lesson here for all students out there  pay attention in Science class! For the rest of us  'get your a** to Mars'!",7,4,41,4 October 2015
The Fighter," The Pride of Lowell
","Greetings again from the darkness. Don't let the hype or the fear of just another 'boxing' movie keep you from this one. Yes, it is based on the true story of 'Irish' Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts, but this is every bit as much a story of family and commitment and tenacity as any story you know.Directed by David O Russell (I Heart Huckabees), the film does a terrific job of dumping us right smack into this blue collar community and this oh-so-colorful family. Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, the younger brother of former boxer Dicky Ecklund (a no-holds-barred Christian Bale). Ecklund lived for years off his fight against Sugar Ray Leonard, where Leonard either was knocked down or slipped down. Either way, Dicky is as close to a local legend as it gets. In the mid-80's, younger brother Micky joined the fight game - with Dicky as his trainer and his mother (Melissa Leo) as his manager.As realistic and believable as the boxing is in the film, the real trick was in presenting Micky's family. The first impression of his mother and gaggle of sisters is that it's a cartoonish presentation. In fact, it's very realistic! When local bartender Charlene (Amy Adams)becomes involved with Micky, she tries to set him straight on exactly what his family is doing to his career.Oh, did I mention that Dicky was a crackhead? Did I mention that his mother pushed him into fights against upper weight classes because she needed the money? Did I mention that Micky tries to remain loyal to the family ... even to the extent of nearly costing him a shot at a legitimate career? There are some real emotions going on all over this well-paced film. Thanks to the Amy Adams character, we really get to see how an 'outsider' views the family, and vice versa. It's not a pretty sight! I can't say enough about Bale's performance as Dicky. He has the movement and gait of both a boxer and a crackhead. His mannerisms mirror that of the real Dicky, as seen over the ending credits. This is crazy good acting. Melissa Leo is fast becoming the hardest working actress in Hollywood. This is the third film I have seen her in this year! Her performance, when combined with Jacki Weaver in Animal Kingdom, really create some nightmares for kids with creepy mothers! Amy Adams is totally convincing as the pretty, tough love interest and guiding light for Micky. As for Wahlberg, he is quite convincing as a boxer. His physicality is without question. The only thing I didn't like was the couple of times he slipped back into his mumbling, whiny persona. Luckily that effect was minimal.This is a film I would recommend to most. The only word of caution is the language is quite realistic for working class Lowell, Mass. In other words, the 'F' word is utilized in every conceivable manner throughout. It's just part of the community fabric. Also, be warned that the boxing is also quite realistic ... it's a violent sport and that comes across very well. I loved how the boxing matches were filmed digitally for effect. Just a wonderfully well made film with terrific performances ... and actually quite uplifting!",8,32,43,14 December 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," It's gonna be Biblical
","Greetings again from the darkness. Gerard Butler keeps his streak alive. He is good in every movie, regardless of whether the movie itself is very good. Not that this one is awful, it was just disappointingly inconsistent.Director F Gary Gray (The Italian Job) teams with writer Kurt Wimmer (The Recruit) to provide one fascinating character (Butler) and his nemesis - the wasted opportunity played by Jamie Foxx. The Foxx character is so poorly written, at least in the first 45 minutes, that I wanted to laugh outloud almost every time he said something stupid or even just strutted through the hallways of justice. I will admit that Foxx and his character were much more interesting once the cat and mouse game got serious.Butler's character is terrific throughout. He is one of those sneaky smart guys who just happens to be a pro at killing people in unusual ways. His twisted lecture series for Foxx is a hoot and captivating. Every time he is on screen, you can't wait for what he is going to do or say next.A big plus for the film is the casting of two top notch supporting actors in Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill - two of the best working these days. It is offset, however, by the totally out of place Leslie Bibb (Talladega Nights and Iron Man) who looks odd and acts even worse. Luckily for her, Oscar nominee Viola Davis (Doubt) takes bad acting to a whole different level with her angry diatribes. Just horrible.With a better script and a little effort from Jamie Foxx, this could have been significantly better. Still worth watching for Butler and his intricate schemes, but disappointing nonetheless.",5,1,3,27 October 2009
Up in the Air," What's in your Backpack?
","Greetings again from the darkness. With Juno and Thank You for Not Smoking, writer/director Jason Reitman had proved himself to be not just a terrific filmmaker, but also one with real insight into people and society. His commentary is based on putting people in real situations and having us recognize these moments for what they truly mean.Full disclosure - I am not a George Clooney fan. While I recognize his appeal to the masses, I usually only appreciate him when he steps out of the Clooney role and into something messy (Syriana). In this film, he does a pretty good job of removing his tongue from his cheek and playing the role with the necessary head-on approach it requires. His scenes with Vera Farmiga are extremely well written and acted; but it's his scenes with Anna Kendrick that make this film something special.Clooney seems to be getting all the pub for this, but Ms. Kendrick delivers a turn that provides the emotional depth and link to the audience. My favorite scene is with the three leads discussing their ever-changing life dreams. As they say, youth is wasted on the young.So many insightful moments about everything from loneliness to independence to loyalty to belonging ... all mixed with the harsh realities of the business world at a time when everyone lives in fear of losing their job. Watching these people talk about the pain and humiliation of losing a job that is so intertwined with their person is just excruciating. This really plays out in the scene with J.K. Simmons.Gotta mention the great Sam Elliott in his brief moment as he chats it up with his airline's most loyal customer. Mr. Elliott never disappoints, even if on screen for just a couple of minutes. Thanks to Mr. Reitman for delivering yet another film with bite ... something to chew on and appreciate.",8,1,7,11 December 2009
Atonement," My Baby, He Wrote Me a Letter
","Greetings again from the darkness. Teaming up again after 'Pride and Prejudice' are director Joe Wright and the finally maturing Keira Knightley. This time they tackle Ian McEwan's monster novel and for the most part deliver a tense, emotional ride.Knightley and James McAvoy ('The Last King of Scotland') are very good and very believable together, but the 'star' of the film is Knightley's wicked lil sis played by three actresses - Saoirse Ronan (age 13), the weak link of Ramola Garai (age 18) and a perfectly cast Vanessa Redgrave as the elder Briony wrapping the story up for the viewer in a TV interview for her final novel. By the way, the interviewer in that scene is 'The English Patient' director Anthony Minghella.Not to give anything away, but normally the story is what makes a film enjoyable for me. Here, I actually admired the film's structure and delivery of the story ... definitely not dumbed down the way so many book-to-movie projects are. Certainly the middle of the film drags a bit as McAvoy wanders through the countryside and 18 yr old Briony pays her penance as a war nurse, but the first 45 minutes of the film are truly outstanding.Just a warning, this is not the feel good, sappy Hollywood garbage that many think it is. Many scenes are extremely uncomfortable to watch and I heard more than a few sniffles coming from the crowd. The score is outstanding and expertly conveys depth to many scenes ... especially the remarkable long cut as McAvoy walks through the beach camp for soldiers.Excellent support work from Brenda Blethyn and Benedict Cumberbatch ('Amazing Grace'), and again the elegant Ms. Redgrave perfectly captures Briony's struggle for the truth and redemption and 'atonement'.",8,4,6,29 December 2007
V for Vendetta," Street Fightin' Man
","Greetings again from the darkness. First time director James McTeige has to feel like he won the lottery. Handed an outstanding cast, a terrific screenplay based on a popular graphic novel and the magic of the Wachowski Brothers ('The Matrix'), McTeige must be giddy just being part of this spectacular production.Hugo Weaving stars as V, a revolutionary terrorist out for revenge and some overall world-saving. Wearing a very cool mask and twirling ultra sleek ginsu knives, V takes revenge on those who experimented on him and others with a very nasty virus. Along the way, he stumbles on a real cutie in Evey (Natalie Portman) who just happens to be the offspring of some infamous revolutionaries. The relationship between V and Evey is the heart of the film and very interesting to follow. They are being chased by a detective played by Stephen Rea who seems to be smarter than the Orwellian dictator played by a way-overacting John Hurt. His characters name is Adam Sutler, which is (not coincidently) similar to Adolph Hitler.The story is kind of unique in that it works in so many aspects of history while staying centered on our fictional characters. Something tells me the fun game to play once this is released on DVD will be counting the 'V' references throughout. Early on, Weaving has a soliloquy that must utilize 93% of the V words in Webster's. It is quite a challenge to follow the first time through. In addition to the spoken V words, the number of 'V'isuals is astonishing.Don't be disappointed that we never get to see Portman (with her Sinead O'Connor look) actually fight. This is not really a huge action picture, although there are some stunning moments. This is much more of a political statement that can be twisted to fit any country at any time. The Wachowski brothers once again break new ground and it is definitely worth watching a time or two.",8,4,9,19 March 2006
The Island," Dood, I found a bug
","Greetings again from the darkness. The comparisons to 'Logan's Run' are inevitable and there are many familiarities with 'Minority Report', 'Coma', 'Total Recall' and even the remake of 'Invasions of the Body Snatchers'. Of course, these are expected when one combines sci-fi with a future world and cloning! Director Michael Bay must have been quite the terror as a boy growing up. I envision young Mikey trying to blow things up and perform stunts on his bike after attaching the motor from the lawn mower. Now that he is big and rich, he gets to do it for real in EVERY one of his movies ('Bad Boys', 'The Rock' 'Armageddon' 'Pearl Harbor'). I will say he is very consistent.'The Island' is a bit of stretch for Bay and I don't believe he quite pulls it off. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson couldn't possibly be any more photogenic and gosh, they sure can RUN. Haven't seen this much running in a movie since the Steve Prefontaine story. The supporting cast is stellar with Sean Bean pulling off one his patented bad guy smoothies, Djimon Hounsou ('In America' 'Gladiator') is underutilized as a renegade bounty hunter, Michael Clarke Duncan ('The Green Mile') has one terrific scene and the great Steve Buscemi is a wonderfully quirky addition. Despite all the star power and fire power, the film leaves us feeling a bit flat.The best scenes are with McGregor when his clone and owner together - whether in an ultra cool house or a very fast caddy. The worst scenes are the car/copter/motorcycle chases which look just like the Bad Boys stuff.'The Island' is eye candy for those who aren't really concerned about the details in a story - quite a few of which are left hanging here.",6,2,6,24 July 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Plot, Where Art Thou?
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Another quirky experience from the Coen's, who have provided some of my favorite moviegoing moments.  'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo' are classics, and 'The Hudsucker Proxy' 'Miller's Crossing' and 'Barton Fink' are right behind.  I was never a fan of 'Raising Arizona', but this similar film has some really great touches.  No one casts more brilliantly than the Coens.  Not a fan of George Clooney, but he is outstanding in his role.  Many Coen regulars make their appearances (Holly Hunter, John Goodman, John Turturro) but I loved Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar. My favorite bits include the spoofs on legendary guitarist Robert(called Tommy in the film) Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads, and infamous bank robber George Nelson's (wonderfully played by Son of Sam actor Michael Badalucco) reaction to being called 'Baby Face'. As a film lover, I trust the Coens to push the envelope every time out.  Weak story in this one, but truly enjoyable nonetheless.  The funniest part is that after seeing this film, people are buying the soundtrack!  T Bone Burnett does a remarkable job of making one want to purchase a hillbilly CD.",8,0,1,5 February 2001
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The Matador and the Blind Shoemaker
","Greetings again from the darkness. The three headed creative team of Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Judd Apatow obviously work very well together. Although 'T-Nights' is not quite at the level of 'Anchorman' or 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', it comes from the same gene pool and features some hilarious moments and great lines.Once again, Will Ferrell is the centerpiece of this one trick pony. Ferrell's best comedic traits are that we constantly expect him to say something funny and, even more importantly, he can deliver a straight line in a manner that causes laughter.Fans of the above mentioned movie will recognize most of the faces in the supporting cast. Receiving the most screen time are John C. Reilly as Ricky Bobby's life long Shake and Bake buddy, and Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) as the nemesis gay French driver who pretty much drives Ricky Bobby over the proverbial edge. Also in the cast are Gary Cole (as Ricky Bobby's long lost Dad, who is NEVER without a beer), Jane Lynch (as Ricky's mom), Michael Clarke Duncan (as the crew chief), David Koechner (crew member) and Molly Shannon (as the sloshed car team owner's wife). Don't miss the nice performance from an almost unrecognizable Amy Adams (so wonderful in 'Junebug') as one of Ricky Bobby's biggest supporters and his final love interest.The film basically delivers what it promises. A bunch of laughs and no real story to speak of. You do have to kind of like a film with a soundtrack that features both Roger Miller and AC/DC ... not to mention a french version of the Rolling Stones!! As always, stay for the closing credits for an extra chuckle or two.",6,16,33,6 August 2006
Semi-Pro," with the exception of Henry Ford
","Greetings again from the darkness. Will Ferrell is one of the funniest guys in show biz. A huge part of comedy is risk. No risk = No comedy. Big time producer, first time director Kent Alterman and 'Old School' writer Scot Anderson team up with Ferrell and for some reason play it safe. Very safe. So safe that there are only a few chuckles here and not a single laugh out loud moment.This movie is just not funny. And it has nothing to do with Ferrell going for another sport-based flick. The ABA and the 70's offer a vast array of topics and targets. Sadly most of those are ignored here. As Jackie Moon, the one hit wonder from the music biz, Ferrell acts as the owner, coach, player, ring-leader and promotional face of the Flint Tropics ... the worst team in the ABA. Sadly, none of this matters because there are just no funny bits here.Andre Benjamin, Woody Harrelson, Maura Tierney and David Koechner all go through the motions of their lame dialogue. Will Arnett and Andrew Daly as the team radio announcers had my hopes up initially, but alas, turned out to be another one-trick pony. I felt most sorry for Patti LaBelle and Jackie Earle Haley who had to be humiliated to even read their lines.Nothing is more difficult than comedy and nothing is more pathetic than an unfunny comedy. The weak attempts at drama are always overshadowed by an over the top moment that falls flat ... a bear loose in the arena, a tantrum in the league office, disco dancing, team dancers, etc. The best two moments are the throw-away line about Henry Ford and the introduction of the Alley Oop ... straight from heaven.As if all this wasn't distressing enough, before the film started we were 'treated' to the trailer of Ferrell's next movie ... a reteaming with John C. Riley. When a comedy trailer has no laughs, the hopes for the movie are extremely low. Maybe it is time for Ferrell to grow up and play other people's stuff ... he was great in 'Stranger Than Fiction'. The money train is tough to jump from, but one's dignity has to be worth something.",4,7,14,2 March 2008
Furious 7," For Paul
","Greetings again from the darkness. 'For Paul'. A touching tribute to the late Paul Walker provides an emotional end to the most high-octane (sorry about that) F&F episode yet  and the perfect victory lap (sorry again) for the franchise. Of course, we know that it won't be the last, if for no other reason than easy box office money.The franchise began in 2001, and the familiar faces are back: Vin Diesel as Dom, Paul Walker as Brian, Jordana Brewster as Brian's wife Mia, Michelle Rodriguez as amnesiac Letty, Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges as comic relief Roman and Tej, respectively, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Agent Hobbs. New to the scene are Djimon Honsou as a terrorist, Ronda Rousey and Tony Jaa as elite henchmen (henchpersons?), Nathalie Emmanuel as super-hacker Ramsey, and Kurt Russell as the shadowy government-type cutting shady deals for fuzzy reasons. The biggest add is of course, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw, the Black Ops big brother to Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) – silenced villain from the previous film (in which Statham made a brief appearance foreshadowing this story line).Achieving remarkable success for what started as a fun little street racing cult film, this series thrives on its familiar characters, simple plot lines, staggering lineup of dream cars, and ever-louder and larger stunts, fights and set pieces. One of the earliest scenes features a fight scene that would be the climax of most action movies: The Rock vs Jason Statham. Rather than end or solve anything, this fight merely serves as a set-up for one of the film's punchlines – involving The Rock and a plaster arm cast (pay no attention to that leg cast). In the middle, we get a too brief clash between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey, but the real finale is a rooftop battle between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that has such an extended cut-away, we almost forget they are going at each other.In between those colossal fights, we get Paul Walker sprinting up the side of a bus that is sliding off a cliff, a wicked and armed drone, car chases galore – including one with a stealth chopper, synchronized10,000 foot car drops from an airplane, and most impressively, car jumps between the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. That last one is not just any car, but a stunning red Lykan Hypersport  one with little resale value after its final trip.Michelle Rodriguez' character is fighting her amnesia, Ludicrous and Tyrese play off each other like Laurel and Hardy, while Dom does his best Yoda impression, and Statham comes off like a revenge-seeking missile from a Terminator movie. Every character gets their fair share of posing, preening, strutting and smirking. It would be an insult to call this over-the-top because that would imply we have previously seen the top. This is high-speed, high-altitude mayhem that plays directly to a large fan base.Personally, I'm not a devout F&F follower, and have seen only the first entry prior to this latest. My attendance for Furious 7 was driven (get it?) by my interest in seeing the tribute to Walker, and my personal code of seeing every Kurt Russell movie (don't ask). However, I do understand the mass appeal, and I believe the followers will appreciate the approach of director James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring), who replaces 3 time series director Justin Lin.",5,70,159,5 April 2015
The Godfather," Would you like an orange?
","Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. 'I believe in America.' That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc. There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an 'eye-level' camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.The famous 'Mattress Sequence' was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.It's quite fascinating to recognize how many 'classic' lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse.",10,2,5,3 March 2012
