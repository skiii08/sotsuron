The Blair Witch Project," Excellent, if your in the right mindset...
","I can see why many people may have been disappointed by this film. People go into a movie these days expecting sooo much. They want special effects, music, predictable plots etc...Blair Witch has none of this, and that's GREAT!! For once, a different kind of movie. Even after the horrible criticism I heard of this, I watched it on DVD tonight, with my girlfriend and all the lights out-with the inclination we would not like it nor be 'scared'...and it scared us both unbelievably. I have never been that scared from a film I will admit. The key is to step into the movie, which they make so easy to do. And I dont care what any tough guy writes, you would be scared sh*tless if you were in that situation. Also, watching the new prelude they have for this (on DVD or rental)helps build the premise and suspense. Excellent job to the makers of this, and I hope they get their cut of the cash.",10,1,2,22 October 1999
Independence Day," Overall good movie, with a typical Hollywood ending
","This is a good movie, and I think most people would agree the first time they saw it in the theater they were impressed. It has comedy, awesome special effects, and one thing that most movies didnt do before this...millions of innocent people die! As the movie progresses after the destruction sequences though it seems to lose its punch, and then the 'Hollywoodism's' take over. Hero saves the day, and streching any possibilities becomes standard procedure. Good to watch a couple times, then forget it. Good on the big screen, and even a good home system.",Null,0,1,21 March 2000
